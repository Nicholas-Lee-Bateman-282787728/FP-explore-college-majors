1633535,3,B00005NGAB,"This is a quaint performance, the sparse stage does not detract from the nice performances.  My only real quibble is the sound quality.  For a DVD released in 2001, I was surpised that it only had 2.0 stereo.  Add to that the fact that I had to turn the volume way up on the stereo just to get normal output.
Overall good, but could be better sound-wise.",1057449600,14,354,4.253731343283582
1633536,5,B00005NGAB,"Mozart's ""Le Nozze Di Figaro"" is really the sequel to Rossini's ""Barber Of Seville"". Chronologically, the story takes place in the time after Figaro the barber has helped the Count win the hand of the fair Rosina. Figaro is now a man servant to the Count (which if you really think about it puts the Count in an ungrateful and unfriendly light). Rosina, simply called ""the Countess"" in this particular opera, is facing a crisis. Her husband the Count is turning his affections to the maid Susanna Figaro's fiancee!(what a rotten apple the Count is!). But Figaro, Susanna and the Countess devise a great scheme to deceive the Count, to punish his roaming eye and to reconcile him with his wife.
What follows is a four act opera that is regarded by many as Mozart's most brilliant romantic comedy. At its time in the late eighteenth century, in the wake of French revolution, the opera was controversial, as was the French novels by Beamarchais, from which the opera was based. The bedroom comedy deals with class struggle, society and the fickle human nature. The Count is put to shame in the last act when he serenades the Countess in disguise as Susanna, only to discover it is his wife all along. ""Contessa! Perdono!"" the Count sings in a supplication of forgiveness, in music that expresses emotion and deep feeling. The Countess forgives her husband and all is forgivened. The rest of the characters join in a sublime chorus announcing a happy finale- Figaro will marry Susanna as planned and the Count and the Countess renew their love.",1048204800,8,1541,4.775280898876405
1633537,5,B00005NGAB,"The Marriage of Figaro on this DVD is a good one, boasting fine acting and splendid voices.

The production is done at the Opera National de Lyon with its small and intimate stage and is performed before a live audience. Paolo Olmi conducts the orchestra. The sets have an attractive pastel quality without being overdone and the costumes fit the period for which the work was written. Also, the camera angles and video switching is well done.

This opera was one of three where Mozart used Lorenzo Da Ponte for the libretto and with the same results: a plot full of twists, suspense and surprises. Add to the words, the great music of Mozart, and you have a winning combination.

Stellar performances by Giovanni Furlanetto as Figaro, Elzbeta Szymtka as Suzanne, Ludovic Tezier as the count, Janice Watson as the Countessa and Francesca Provvisionato as Cheribino highlight the opera.

Although this cast does not have the blockbuster stars to sing the leading roles, it does have actors and actresses that seem to have a special sexy chemistry with each other that makes for a wonderful presentation. They are young, vibrant, enthusiastic and committed to the roles they are portraying onstage and yet at the same time seem to be having a great deal of fun.

A wonderful production of  ""Le Nozze"": one you will be happy to have in your collection of great opera.",1039737600,19,1364,4.8076923076923075
1633538,2,B00005NGAB,"Mozart's best opera is done almost no justice with this poorly staged, boring mess. The set is sparse and uninteresting and the perfmormers lack the spontenaeity and vim that Mozart/DaPonte's characters require. Furlanetto is terrific as Figaro, and Szymtka is a charming Susanna, but neither the countess (played like an amateur) nor the count (simply boring) hold our attention. The actual blocking looks as if it were done by a first-year directing student. It is often imbalanced and, again, because it rarely enhances the dramatic tension of the (admittedly tense) situation, it is boring. Simply put, this opera needs to be put up by a cast of talented actors (singing isn't enough for -Figaro-) and a director sensitive to the subtlties of Mozart's complex and emotionally nuanced score.",1039651200,9,794,5.2109375
1633539,5,B00005NGAB,"This is a very fine Figaro, and probably the best version currently available on DVD.  Technically, the DVD is very good, with a clear sharp picture and good sound (it was recorded in 1994).  The sets are also very nice - vibrant and colorful, suggesting a sunny mediterranian setting.
The performance is excellent both in terms of singing and orchestral playing.  The Lyon Opera Orchestra is a technically suberb ensemble with convincing leadership in conductor Paolo Olmi.  His interpretation is full of spirit, and he seems to find an ideal middle road in terms of performance style - tempos are lively, but never pushed to uncomfortable speeds, and slower arias are geven their full breadth without ever becoming heavy, slow or marmoreal.  Clarity between strings and woodwinds is exemplary.
The youthful, attractive cast is just as good.  While none of them were previously known to me, they all turned out to be secure singers and very good actors who become convincingly involved in their roles.  I found the roles of the Count and Figaro to be especially well done.  I was a little less enamoured of the Susanna and Contessa both of whom are very good, while not being excellent.  Cherubino is also top-notch - the singer portraying the role sings and acts wonderfully, and looks more convincingly like a teenage boy than any other production I have ever seen.
Truth be told, I did not expect to enjoy this Figaro as much as I did given my unfamiliarity with the cast and conductor. But now having seen it I'm VERY glad I decided to take a chance and buy it.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case, but those looking for a good Figaro on DVD can buy this one with confidence - It really is superb...  Enjoy!!",1039392000,41,1721,4.722408026755853
1633540,5,B00005NGAB,"I found this performance truly exciting.  The singing is great, the acting is superb, the singers are young and sexy, so the whole spirit of this opera is so well conveyed.  It is a truly enjoyable performance and I can only wish that modern opera production continue with this degree of professionalism, passion and realism.",1019347200,7,325,4.890909090909091
1633541,4,B00005NGAB,"I had only seen one other performance of ""Le Nozze"" and that was live in San Francisco.  That performance was perhaps perfect in every way! Unfortunately for the DVD production, it thus was viewed against rather high expectations.
  The other reviewers do not slight the singing and I agree that it is superb.  Similarly, the acting is quite good, especially for an opera.  In two ways I was a bit disappointed: the sets were somewhat unimaginative and the overall spirit of the performance was slightly lacking -- the San Francisco performance had me smiling broadly throughout the performance and its stunning aliveness is not often found in opera (of course, it featured the incomparable Sylvia McNair, who has it all!)
  I can therefore imagine that this may not be the definitive ""Le Nozze.""  But watch it anyway!",1012953600,9,818,4.91970802919708
1633542,2,B00005NGAB,"I was quite suprised to read the very positive reviews of this video. I have 6 versions of Le Nozze and this comes a distant last in that pile. In my opinion, the performance lacks charisma, subtlety and musical beauty. Furlanetto is certainly a great singer but he fell flat here in every scene for me. Perhaps this was the artistic direction or the transfer from the stage to the small screen but the affect was a uniform disappointment.
For a contrast, in my collection, the Glyndebourne production with Finley, Hagley and Fleming reigns supreme not only amongst Le Nozze but over all comers...",1012694400,15,597,4.75
1633543,5,B00005NGAB,"I had great expectations for this Nozze di Figaro, and after my first viewing, my high expectations have all been exceeded.  This is a Nozze to treasure, as it is a magnificent performance from start to finish.  Giovanni Furlanetto's singing and acting are superb as Figaro--yet I have nothing but admiration  and praise for everyone in the cast.  The singers have a real understanding of Mozart's characters, and they truly bring them to life in a way that I have rarely seen.  There are absolutely no weak links in the cast despite many names that may be unfamiliar to most viewers.  This DVD is truly a jewel, and its visual and sound quality are excellent.  It preserves a beautiful and very special performance of one of the greatest operas ever written.  I cannot imagine any fan of Mozart or opera not being greatly pleased with this DVD, and  without reservation I rank it among the best I have ever seen.",1001808000,54,913,4.65625
1633544,4,B00005NGAB,"This was great, but judging by other peoples' reviews on other videos that I've seen other viewers might think different.  This video has many great qualities, but te best of all is that the two arias ""Il capro e la capretta""(sung by Marcellina) & ""In quegli anni""(sung by Don Basilio) aren't omitted.  Usually they are, & this is the first time I have seen them recorded on tape. Giovanni Furlanetto is a great Figaro mostly because he is kind, sweet, & friendly, but close to the end he looks a little bit like he is drunk.  Otherwise he is wonderful.  Elzbieta Szmytka was okay as Susanna, exept she seemed kind of unfriendly to most of the other characters at parts.  Janice Watson is very good as Countess Almaviva, but when she is seen in act two she seems a little bit plump, otherwise she is really good, especially in the fourth act.  Ludovic Tezier was good as Count Almaviva, although he seemed to have a little too much make-up on.  He also was in a bath robe when he is first seen in the first act.  Francesca Provvisionato is not very convincing as Cherubino, but still has a very beautiful voice that works well with the character.  The beautiful lyric soprano voice of Tiziana Tramonti as Marcellina was probably the best soprano voice that you could find, because Marcellina is usually sung as a mezzo-soprano.  Marcello Lippi's great bass voice is hard to compete with, even when it comes to the sounds of Paolo Montarsolo & Samuel Ramey.  Sergio Bertocchi was perfect for Basilio with his great buffo tenor voice, especially in ""In quegli anni"", his only aria.
There are subtitles on this video, & they are very easy to see because there is a special region at the bottom of the screen for them.  The translation isn't very accurate, but it still is great, & I reccomend this video very much.",994550400,26,1811,4.590062111801243
7946939,4,B00005NGAB,"There are many Figaros on DVD and Blu ray and this is one you can safely choose, even if it's the only one you own. It is no superstar performance, but a lively, compelling rendition done by a very capable regional opera house. The singers are all quite good and act their roles with vigor and humor. I really like the spontaneous, realistic feel of this production. It just feels fresh and sexy. A souffle of a Figaro, and that's not a bad thing.

There is, though a fly in the ointment. Unless the DVD company has upgraded the disk (I got my copy 13 years ago), its viewing on a modern widescreen TV will be compromised. It is not anamorphic widescreen. It was a letterbox version made to appear widescreen only for an old CRT TV. Meaning the show appears in the center of your modern widescreen, surrounded on all sides by black bars. When you resize it to fit your screen, most of the subtitles vanish out of sight. So that's no real help, unless you speak Italian.",1511568000,,969,4.383333333333334
7946940,3,B00005NGAB,"Nice to watch, but the sound quality is not good enough to understand the words, and there are no Italian subtitles.  Not a big inconvenience if you already know the opera (I own three other versions), but no great pleasure in watching it either.  This one will go to the library's second-hand bookstore.",1501113600,,304,4.716981132075472
7946941,5,B00005NGAB,I checked this out at a public library a while back. It is superb. The fellow who plays Cherubino makes this opera! This DVD was the first time I watched the opera completely. It is incredible. I don't understand how people can give it negative reviews honestly. This to me was the ultimate opera. This DVD is why I personal consider Le Nozze di Figaro to be Mozart's magnum opus.,1440460800,,380,4.442857142857143
7946942,4,B00005NGAB,This DVD was an amazing way to sit back in the comfort of one's home and enjoy the dazzling music of Mozart at his finest. The duet which electrified the convicts in The Shawshank Redemption now can be seen in its original setting and learn in the music that soared to the heavens so much about the dynamics and pitfalls of Love.,1415577600,,329,4.32258064516129
7946943,5,B00005NGAB,"There is no one very famous attached to this production but everyone sings well, acts well, looks well. This is also one of the most intelligent and truthful representations of a Mozart opera you are ever likely to see. Vincent's production finds the heart of the opera in the attention above all to Mozart and da Ponte's text, its original scenography and its rhythms. It is mentioned in the booklet that the producer is thoroughly immersed in Beaumarchais's play and I suspect this also tells because it makes a difference in understanding the opera to know how it was adapted from its source (with both the proximity and the divergences being significant).

Particularly telling is the recitative - which is wonderfully poised, natural in expression but never losing the sense of meter: the same care you need for the verse in a Shakespeare play. It also never threatens the theatrical emphasis in the action allocated by the composer and the librettist through the musical numbers, and it always flows. The visual gestures are reminiscent of eighteenth century French engravings and paintings without it ever becoming archaeological. There is this profound sense that everybody has thought their way through the text and arrived at the point where they can embody their character freely. Paolo Olmi conducts with superb grace and precision: I don't know why he isn't better known.

The other day I looked in on a BBC broadcast of a Hi Tech Don Giovanni from Covent Garden. The effects were magnificent (and silly) but truthfully everything was adrift: no one looked like they knew what they were doing except getting through it all. It was terrible junk - may be the producer didn't get to work with his singers enough because he was so busy co-ordinating the effects, which in turn upstaged the real action. Maybe the conductor was no good because he was having to accomodate the concept. This Figaro is the real thing.",1398729600,,1924,4.9169230769230765
7946944,4,B00005NGAB,"I think this version of The Marriage of Figaro may be one of the best available, if we can trust the reviews at this site!

After reading lots of different reviews of 4 or 5 different dvds, I chose this one, noting that many reviewers enjoyed it, and thought the performing and recording quality were very good, but that it was recorded at rather a low volume.

I've found that those comments were spot on. It really is recorded at a  rather subdued level. If you do purchase it, remember to lower the volume when watching the TV or another video, or you will get quite a shock!

The other comment I would make is that the subtitles seem to whizz by in a flash, and when the singers sing the same text over and over, as happens in a lot of opera, you have completely forgotten what they were singing within a few seconds of the subtitles quickly disappearing. But this is only a minor discomfort.

I don't think you will be disappointed by this version. Hope that you enjoy it as much as we have.",1318032000,2,996,4.304812834224599
7946945,4,B00005NGAB,"This one was performed before a live audience and recorded with parabolic mikes, I think. The sound quality is reasonably good, but there are thin spots in places when someone turns her head at the wrong place. Also, the miking picks up an inordinate amount of footfall noise, but it probably isn't worse objectively than in a live performance; you just notice it more on a dvd. The singers all have good strong voices, and the acting is reasonably good.

It's worth the money, but if a really good nozze comes along, you're probably going to want to buy that one too.",1184803200,2,568,4.568627450980392
7946946,5,B00005NGAB,"I really enjoyed this opera clarity of the DVD was Excellant

I felt like I was viewing from a ""live"" audience",1171497600,,110,4.238095238095238
7946947,5,B00005NGAB,"No recording of Le Nozze di Figaro would ever get less than 5 stars from me unless the singers were sadly out of tune. This performance certainly has no such flaw; the singers are splendid and vocally suitable to their roles. The sets are charming. The stage action is gracefully theatrical. This is an extremely well-balanced ensemble of music, theater and visual art. Other performances may include more enormous vocal talents, but few could be more enjoyable.",1160956800,5,462,5.012987012987013
7946948,5,B00005NGAB,"This production is a sheer delight.  I remember saying ""No wonder opera won't go away after 400 years"" when experiencing this for the first time.  Mozart's penchant for making all the characters, no matter what side of the conflict they are on, completely irresistable.  You'll want all these delightful folks  to get their way. (except, perhaps, the Count!)  Very well photographed, in a simple, yet elegant set.  Szymtka, while not a natural beauty, aces the two suductive arias.  And, her 'letter duet' with the Contessa will melt you into a puddle. I have seen 3 other versions of her role that don't come close.  Furlanetto, as Figaro, is exceptionally fun to watch and hear.  The rest of the well-balanced cast fills in nicely, to fill the 3 hours with more comedy, poignant moments, drama, and great music than seems possible. Out of about 80 versions of various operas I have seen so far, this is still my favorite.",1111795200,13,923,4.791139240506329
