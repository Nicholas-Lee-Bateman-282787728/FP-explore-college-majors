8271779,3,B00193PUVQ,I liked this film. It has an interesting view on the subject of good and evil and shows a different perspective on the Adam and Eve myth. Some of the fight scenes are a bit graphic when two male characters lose an important body part. The cinematography is quite good for a B-movie,1360540800,,281,4.320754716981132
8271780,5,B00193PUVQ,"""The Last Eve"" is actually a trilogy of short tales which gives imaginative new interpretations to the Adam and Eve story. The first story is ""Eve's Secret,"" which takes place in a post-apocalyptic landscape. An ill-timed comet has turned the Earth into a barren landscape, leaving Adam and Eve to start the human tale all over again. There is a third person in an enigmatic hooded priest, whose presence is not entirely clear. Satan, naturally, wants to make mischief and stop Adam and Eve from procreating, so he sends seven martial artist demons to kill them. But the demons all want to possess Eve and they fight among themselves in fatal competition. The surviving demons, a chain-swinging Lucifer and a blind swordsman called Behemoth, due battle with Adam. Yet the prize of Eve comes with a surprise that Adam neither expects nor desires. Yet another surprise visitor shows Adam that the post-apocalyptic world may be a lot happier than he anticipated.

The second story is ""Cain & Abel,"" and the action is switched to contemporary Korea. Cain is now Eve's sister and Abel is Adam's brother. Adam works as a gravedigger; he used to be the star of the underground martial arts fight circuit, but he landed a fatal injury which numbed him to the activity. He is training Abel to become a professional fighter. Adam wants to marry Eve, but Cain (who orchestrates the underground fights) wants to lure Adam back into the ring. This happens when Abel is killed during one of those clandestine matches. Adam gets revenge and the girl, but loses something in the process.

The third story is ""Snake's Temptation,"" which takes place in Los Angeles. Adam, Eve and Snake were raised by a priest in an orphanage. Adam and Eve kept their virginity and are now engaged to be wed. Snake, being the bad boy that he is, has his own harem of hotties who seem to lie around his pool all day sipping wine and dropping Biblical double-entendres (Delilah, Jezebel and Salome are among the naughty girls). Snake does his best to tempt Eve, while Adam views Eve's betrayal with a visit to Lilith (yeah, she's not in the Bible, but some folks insist she belongs there).

Although it's a weird production that attempts to bring together three interpretations of the Biblical story of Adam and Eve, diverse martial arts action, and Korean and American culture, all while set to an apocalyptic story that unfolds in reverse order. I still find this movie very interesting.

 The Colors are beautiful, the action scenes are stunning, and Young Man Kang is an excellent director.

I recommend this film not just because it's joyful but of the experience of this film!",1336003200,3,2645,4.802197802197802
8271781,1,B00193PUVQ,I tried watching the movie but had to turn it off after 15 minutes. So freaking boring.,1239840000,,87,4.176470588235294
8271782,1,B00193PUVQ,"I watched this movie after some off the beaten track review that said this was a avant guard movie and had scenes.
But this has to be one of the worst movies that I have seen, on a rating out of ten I would give it a minus 10.",1237507200,,226,3.63265306122449
8271783,1,B00193PUVQ,"When it comes to foreign films, the first set of information is usually the product/DVD packaging.  Looking at the this DVD one would expect a vivid, live, and entertaining movie.  The pictures show what can only be described as intense action with fighters standing toe to toe and beautiful women gracing the covers.  I did some research and there was a website (best to leave unknown) where it pronounced this movie ""Young Man Kangs brilliant reinterpretation of the Adam and Eve legend audaciously imagines the story in an avant-garde triptych spanning the post-apocalypse, a Korean underground fight circuit and the L.A. hedonism orbit. A wealth of stunning imagery, an endlessly original screenplay and a strong ensemble (particularly Chris Torres as the demon Leviathan) makes this an invigorating masterwork.""  So, you would expect a fun and entertaining movie, right? WRONG!!
I cannot go into how bad this movie is.  On IMDB this movie got around 2.5 out of 10 stars and I believe that was generous. Time does not permit me to detail the waste of time spent watching this movie.  I was HOPING that at some point it would get better but hope was not enough.",1236816000,2,1164,4.913265306122449
