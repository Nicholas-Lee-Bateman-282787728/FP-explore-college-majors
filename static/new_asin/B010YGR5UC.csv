8723227,5,B010YGR5UC,"This is a classic favourite of my mothers and the family came to love it also.
As this originally was only released on Betamax video and the family thought it was lost forever when our oldest video player (Betamax) ran out of steam in the mid 1990""s... We searched for the movie in all the video stores (well before shopping online was even heard of), but gave up after 10 years looking.
Then the other day, I saw a snippet of the movie on uTube and this fired up my quest to find the movie again...
Thus, finding the DVD on Amazon was quite a pleasant surprise and snapper up a copy immediatley.
Its a great animated movie for the older (16 years plus)(NON PRUDE) set.
It is a classic cartoon porn of the mid 1970's... Very funny and a great spoof(pardon the pun)of early childhood fairy tales.
Well recommended by my family and myself.",1259798400,2,837,4.406451612903226
8723228,2,B010YGR5UC,"This movie consists of 3 children's stories that are retold to fit an adult's view. The movie features bizarre situations and illogical situations centered on sex. I would believe they did this to supply its twisted humor. The animation does not come close to resemble modern day adult content, because of repetitive animation, obsession over female parts, spontaneous sex drive, and growing pants.",1257984000,,398,5.333333333333333
8723229,5,B010YGR5UC,"This is the first adult cartoon I have seen and I was
pleased with this movie.  It's pretty much non-stop sex
through out the whole movie!",1200787200,3,138,4.3076923076923075
8723230,4,B010YGR5UC,"This was very fun. It is a cartoon in the old Hanna-Barbera tradition but decidedly for an Adult audience. Back in 1976 it was given an X-rating. The animators were moonlighters from both the Hanna-Barbera and Disney Studios. Freed from pleasing their usual family audience, they let their horny imaginations run riot. Three classic fairy tales are subjected to their madcap debauchery: ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" ""Cinderella,"" and ""Little Red Riding Hood.""

The animation is of that era. Don't expect the quality of contemporary cartoons. The line drawings and matte paintings are very well done but the animation itself is clunky. They're better then your average Hanna-Barbera cartoon. But no match for Disney's slick animation. Still they do the job effectively and are very enjoyable.

Severin has released this 80-minute long animated feature in its original 1.85:1 widescreen (anamorphic). Picture quality is good though there are still a few dirt specks occuring here and there. Colours are strong, rich and vibrant. There is some damage to the opening live-action portion of the film which Severin has apparently been unable to correct - bad scratch marks on the right edge of the frame. But this is an isolated incident and doesn't detract from the show in the least. Sound is in 2.0 Mono. Extras include the original theatrical trailer plus a 9-minute interview with producer William Silberkleit. Absolutely filthy, hilarious and worth every penny.

PS. Sequels please! And Hurry! Priority goes to remaking ""The Little Mermaid,"" and ""Snow White.""  ;-)",1165017600,18,1561,5.257028112449799
