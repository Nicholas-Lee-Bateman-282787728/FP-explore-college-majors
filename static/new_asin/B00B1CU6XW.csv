8560624,5,B00B1CU6XW,"When I was in Drum Corps in the early 80's, we didn't have any decent way to record or to purchase good quality performances on video. Seeing a performance like these still gets me excited 30 years later. The Picture and Sound quality are both high quality.
The price of these discs are a bit steep, but keep in mind that you receive 2- BD discs that include 12 full-length performances.
  These discs must be very expensive to produce with such a limited demand, so spend a little more to advance this wonderful kind of nostalgic documentation. It's a very special niche that needs to be kept alive by your support!",1410480000,,616,4.54054054054054
