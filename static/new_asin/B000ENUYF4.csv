2524190,5,B000ENUYF4,"In MR. MOM Michael Keaton is a man with a wife and three kids-two elementary school-age boys and a baby girl. Their family is like the classic pre-women's lib-era one: he goes to work every day while she has all the child-care and house-cleaning responsibilities. Then Mike is suddenly laid off from his job. He decides to get another one, but his wife decides she wants to see if she can get one herself. As it happens, she gets hired first, and Mike finds the roles reversed: while his wife goes to work, he must stay home and take care of the kids. Probably my favorite scenes are: when he's at a supermarket and he loses track of one of his boys, and finds some other kid hanging on his shopping cart. He finds his own son standing by a woman with a shopping cart. He switches kids, and as he's walking away with his son he hears the woman call out,""I don't have a kid!"" Also I like the scene where his baby daughter eats a whole can of chili. (Hope they have enough diapers on hand.)

BABY BOOM was one of two films to come out in 1987 that delt with the theme of a childless adult who suddenly becomes the reluctant parent of a baby girl. (The other was THREE MEN AND A BABY.) Here Diana Keaton plays J.C. Wiatt, a high-powered corprate woman whose life is irreversibaly changed when she suddenly inherits a baby girl, Elizabeth. Very funny and charming.",1142726400,8,1360,4.354330708661418

2524244,5,B000ENUYF4,"Funny movie especially when Diane Keaton finds out that the Dr., Who she is spilling her heart out to, is actually a vet.",1425772800,,121,4.304347826086956
2524245,4,B000ENUYF4,"Having recently rewatched this film I can assure you that it is a bonafied classic in the genre of baby comedy. I'm not saying it's the best film out there or nothin, but it certainly holds up with respect to laughs per minute and genuine moments of businesslady baby bonding that tugged at my heartstrings, being a parent myself who missed out on some if not all of the phases and stages of my son's life. He's about 4 now so believe me it is all still fresh in my mind. So basically what this film is is an account of high powered tiger lady Miss Diane Keaton coming to terms with balancing career and family after accidentally having to adopt her sister's baby on account of her sister's tragic death. Not the funniest start to a comedy I know but bear with me here! Now I agree with her not wanting to give the baby to the Christians on account of I grew up around folks like that and no offense to Jesus or nothin, but they were some truly lame individuals without the sense god gave a whore. And I mean that as a compliment to whores, who have seen it all god bless em! So Miss Diane Keaton gets this baby alright and I don't wanna give too much away, but boy is she in for some surprises! Now I am not one of those men who wants to get the women out of the business suits and into the aprons. As a matter of fact I kinda wished she would have kept the business suit on through all the diaper changings and whatnot, because she looked damn fine in it! I like a powerful woman myself is what I'm saying, but i gotta admit that I was concerned that the challenges of motherhood would prove too difficult for a career minded lady such as herself and maybe she should either quit her job and get some help from the state or leave the baby at the hospital like my mom did me and trust the nurses to take care of it. Which they did, it's a long story but basically one of em knew my dad in the biblical sense and recognized me as kin on account of my big baby pecker! Naw I'm just playin, I still had my hospital bracelet on. Anyway, I was proud of her when she came up with the baby food idea and everything but come on, ain't no country time baby mush gonna be the next starbucks, you know what I'm saying? The harebrainedness of some women'll drive you insane. My ex wife for instance thinks she's Steve Jobs 'cause she started an etsy store. I was like listen here, why don't you go on tour for six months and play juke joints with puke on the floor and eat nothin but beer and chimichangas for days and sleep toe to toe in a van with a bunch of cretins who piss in empty Fritos bags. I'll stay home and sell crappy earrings to teen moms. Oh man did she ever wail on me. I guess now I'm sorry I insulted her earrings, ladies if you're reading this they're actually pretty nice.

I had to take one star off because I didn't watch the other film in this double feature. I'll be damned if I'm gonna watch Batman get P whipped by that  lady from Young Frankenstein.",1422230400,,2965,4.1280276816609

2524249,5,B000ENUYF4,"Forget the Woody Allen films of the  70'S . Diane Keaton saved her best work for later in life , If you liked Mr. Mom ,  Baby Boom will make you laugh out loud . She was also great in "" something's gotta give "" .  The other Keaton made an okay batman , but his forte will always be comedy . Come and laugh at the struggles with everyday life .",1358553600,,343,3.736111111111111
