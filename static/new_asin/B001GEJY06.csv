Huk Planas knows how to make the kenpo techniques work and explains the why as well as the how. A must see!",1299628800,2,246,4.145833333333333

Poor Video and Audio Quality
This dvd defintely wasn't shot for eye candy with its boring way of engaging the audience. As for the audio recording there is a hiss in the background the whole time.

I was under the impression that I would be working with traditional teaching methods with learning kenpo techniques and forms.

Formatting
The chapters are marked with gift techniques, manipulation and striking techniques, braille techniques, techniques against weapons, and techniques against two attackers.  There aren't any title markers or anything telling the audience when and what is going on in the video.  The demonstrators just start out in different positions which makes the learning confusing.

As he explains the techniques he doesn't present any kenpo technical information accommodating his movements, other than strike here then strike there.  I see this as bad way to learning kenpo.

People who want to learn kenpo the proper way please look into all the basic names/movements of the stances, strikes, kicks, forms, and techniques. Practice them throughly before moving on to more advanced moves that this dvd presents.  With this you will be well on your way to learning how to master the martial art of kenpo.  Yes there is a lot of movements and ideas that can be learned for practical application in this DVD but if you don't have a good foundation of the art these techniques will be poorly executed in a live situation.

I'm not saying Richard Planas isn't a master of the art of kenpo but the dvd he put his and (Ed Parker's) name on needs some work.

If you feel the need to work on random techniques and moves in an unorganized and a technically unexplained fashion then this dvd is for you.

I find it quite humorous that the only review on this dvd is the people who produced it.
That should have been a red flag to begin with.

DVD REVIEW

""A fantastic new DVD!"" --[...]

Full teachings and keep aspects to evolve in the system.

As Ed Parker used to say the one who knows how he will always be a student, but the one who knows why, he will transform himself into an instructor.

For Planas, Kenpo is a set of rules and principles of movements that, you should study and understand with this premise in mind.

---------------

I pulled these parts of the description out to better help explain my rating for the dvd.

If a product is made it should be able to financially benefit the company that made it BUT it should reach or exceed a quality standard for the consumer.  Also Ed Parker's name on the dvd cover kind of gets me upset as well. Putting well known names on your product to sell it is a good marketing tactic but not living up to Ed Parker's principals for financial gain is ridiculous.

Sorry if that is harsh but I'm really getting sick of people putting work out like this.

I hope I don't get hunted down and judo chopped for this review but production companies need to learn that they can't put out bad quality product and sell it for $30 dollars and get away with it.",1253923200,10,3170,4.589698046181172
