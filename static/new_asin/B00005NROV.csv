7947782,1,B00005NROV,"Like the previous reviewer, I ordered this film, hoping to see a film with James Marsters, Amber Benson and Andy Hallett. This ain't that film. If you want a four-tape set about law enforcement, you may like it. If you want Mere Smith's movie, you're out of luck.",1137801600,7,263,4.5
7947783,1,B00005NROV,"I ordered this expecting the movie with James Marsters and Amber Benson.

It is not.

It is a History Channel production about Military History.

I didn't watch it so I can't actually comment on it's quality but it is not what I thought I was ordering.",1137628800,6,252,4.434782608695652
