Oh, wait. Sorry, wrong movie. No, this is not that movie. It is an Asylum ""production"". That being said, should say it all, right?
High school level ""acting"", cheesy dialogue, lame set-up, and let's not forget, apocalyptic. This is not a serious movie, nor did the co. intend it to be.
There was no nudity, sexual references, foul language, or trashing people with morals. In other words, Liberal Agendites, and the Morally Challenged will hate it.",1465948800,5,489,4.833333333333333

7710031,1,B01DALQ1EO,"If you have seen ""Independence Day"" aka ""War of the Worlds"" you already know the plot and PLOT SPOILER, the ending. In this version a woman VP (Fay Gauthier) becomes President and must personally save the world with the aid of a geek who is no Jeff Goldblum. BTW there are militias out there doing all kinds of things our military can't, because the military doesn't have C4 and explosives like these private groups. The acting was non-existent. There were a few neat large insect/spider looking alien scenes.

The film had zero character build up. Two minutes into the film there is war and at 8 minutes we are talking about the nuclear option. The film shifts gears and I expected a Twilight Zone episode rip-off, ""To Serve Man"" which would have been a much better script than what they did.

7710035,1,B01DALQ1EO,"Comically bad.  Amazed at how much money was spent on making this 5th-grade cine-project.  More amazed that they found people off the street to pretend to be actors....pretending to act.  Even if they were compensated with just food and beverages, they still must have spent six figures in makes this monumental piece of excrement.  I'm sure I'm missing something on the number's side of this project as no one, not even Trump, would be foolish enough to invest in this horror show without some concrete idea on how to monetize this enough to at least recoup their investment.  I feel for the ""actors"" and their families for the shame that they must bear after this project.  I feel even more for the person pretending to be the director of this cowpie.  And lastly, I feel sorriest of all for the poor people who financed this project.

Maybe this is the real-life incarnation of the movie ""The Producers"", but with aliens.  I'll explain.  In the movie The Producers, the producer sets out to put on the worst possible play he can find, ultimately finding one called ""spring time for hitler""...a hitler musical.  He puts on this monstrosity in the hopes that it will fail miserably so that he can keep all the investor money without having to pay back a cent.  He needs that to happen because he promises each investor 50% of the play's profits in order to get them to part ways with their hard earned money.

That's what's going on here.  They just conned family and friends into giving them money. Then they purposely make a piece of garbage of film.  It tanked and the production went bankrupt without having to pay back one red cent.  Genius!  Unlike the movie The Producers, where the play was mistaken for a comedy and ended up being a great success, this scam worked like a charm.",1511308800,,1788,4.625396825396826

Often times I won't sit through longer than the first three minutes since the audio quality is usually the first terrible thing you notice, however, they had the equipment and background to make very decent CGI and quality video when producing this movie.

Finding out what happens to the humans was engaging and an enjoyable turn of events that I did not expect.  I actually wished that the movie was longer even though the pacing was done right and they did a good job at wrapping up the story.

If you directly compared this to a blockbuster movie, it could get around three stars.  Movies don't need to always have a budget of 150mil. and in this movie, they had one of 500k.

7710066,3,B01DALQ1EO,"Ok, so first the good points about the movie: Great CGI, on the same level as level as an A-level movie. Cinematography and overall production quality quite high. Acting was decent too.

Bad point: The storyline was really lame and predictable - This is your typical simplistic B movie alien invasion fare - why do we keep making movies about aliens  trying to invade us, or that are hostile to us? That theme is getting kind of old and repetitive, and losing our collective interest. Is it too difficult to concoct up a more interesting scenario  where maybe aliens are trying to help us instead of annihilating us? Like the recent movie Arrival. Or maybe where they are joining forces with us to help repel another hostile race?
Also, an invading alien race that is able to cross the galaxy would, in all likelihood, be so much more technologically advanced than us, that it's silly to think that with our primitive technology we could do anything at all to them - Like hacking into their system and control their ships - This is ludicrous. Also, it's lame to think that we could infect their Queen with some virus, which then causes all their ships to start blowing up - Seriously? In all likelihood, they would be able to neutralize humanity in a matter of hours and without firing a shot.

C'mon people, we need to get more creative and come up with some fresh new ideas regarding the theme of Aliens - Don't squander a movie's strong points with a really lame, simplistic, and totally unbelievable storyline that's an insult to our intelligence.",1495843200,,1551,4.670329670329671

Look, there's a formula for movies, let the audience learn about the central ensemble, care about them, then the aliens attack and let us root for the ensemble cast. We should be able to see ourselves in their role to suspend our disbelief. Theme was worthy, CGI  okay for low budget, music lame, and writing nominal.

To carry this idea off you might expect to need a multi-million dollar budget, but this is a film from The Asylum and anyone who knows the type of film created by this studio will know what to expect. This is a budget production made for the direct-to-DVD market. And it's a knock-off of a recent major production, made specifically to cash in on someone else's idea and even to fool a few people into buying one film when they really meant to buy another. And from reading other reviews on this site I can see they succeeded on this last point.

However, in regard to The Asylum productions, I don't believe this one is as bad as what people have said. Some of the Asylum's productions are truly awful, thoughtless affairs put together without any care, but with this one there is a reasonably coherent story which moves along at a fair pace and has a satisfactory ending. Yes, the whole thing feels rushed and there is far too much time spent on sub-plots which add nothing to the story, but I can forgive that. Some of the acting is OK, particularly the lead actress who spends a lot of time on screen, and there are a lot of reasonably well done digital effects on display. No, this isn't 'Independence Day: Resurgence' so you don't get all the bells and whistles that tens of millions of dollars provide, but I do like science fiction with aliens and spaceships and the fun that can go along with it if you let yourself enjoy the ride.

The disk has a fairly decent 5.1 surround soundtrack and the movie would have been better if it had been available on Blu-ray, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.",1486080000,,1766,4.529780564263323

So the leader of the hive gets touched with some magical chemical, which can spread thru the air and which somehow causes things to explode - even thru the void of space and all thru Earth's atmosphere.  Meanwhile, the other guy programs a virus for the alien's computer system - was that an intel chip the aliens were using, or was it a 6502?  How did he know the machine language of the alien system - oh, right, aliens use linux so he just used the alien's system to compile the virus... he must have used BlueTooth to transfer the files from his arm iPhone or Android to the alien system.

I found the story line to be a bit contrived - the successful solving of all the alien issues was way too easy - but I liked the way the American team worked together to solve them. I thought the acting was fairly good, except for the crybaby First Son's character, and especially the portrayal of a sensible, strong, and capable woman president. Special effects were not too shabby, either.

All in all, I liked the film except, as I said, for the too-quick alien solutions. I really enjoyed the movie, just wish it was a little longer, to make vanquishing the enemy seem more believable.

I've seen MUCH worse than this film. If you are a Scifi fan, it's worth one watch, just like any other B-series flick (and I've watched a lot of them).

It does have a mild twist at the end, though right before it happens, your brain will probably go ""pop"", I see what they're going to do. But up to that point, the script wanders a bit to fill in time and carry the movie along, so you may not guess it right away.  As others mention, there are bits of blockbuster flicks in this film, but that's the basis of most of the B-movie formula.

The movie itself was horrible. Bad acting. Bad green screen. Bad CGI. Bad story. Bad plot development. Bad story build up, etc..

Everyone has to start somewhere. If you compare this with other B rated, first time movies. It is not as bad. Compare this to what we assumed was the original, and you will be disappointed.

If you watch this title. Just keep in mind this is someone whom is trying to get their startup. Whom ever it is, I hope they learn from their mistakes in this movie and get better. As always, having a bigger budget will produce better quality. Cannot knock them for that.

Remember, when we all started to walk. We all stumbled. Some of us crawled, some of us just kept trying to walk. But all of us had to practice to get it right.",1478649600,,1028,4.366492146596858

7710469,1,B01DALQ1EO,"The original movie ""Independents Day"" with Will Smith, was an outstanding movie.  Riveting story line, great acting and action packed.  This reincarnation  compares favorably to latest remake of classic Ghost Busters... or should I say a ghost of a classic that busted.
The movie drags the story line, if you can call it that lacks and the acting is amateurish.  In this story, there is a lot of talk about a ""smell"" on the alien ships.  Honestly I think they were smelling the movie... LOL.
All in all, the movie is a bomb.  With a weak story line, poor acting and a dismal director, they should have saved their money and made a return of the Teletubbies.
The special effect's are the only thing that even gain it 1 star and that's only because Amazon won't let you rate anything lower than 1 star. :-)

7710581,1,B01DALQ1EO,"I'm sure that this was not supposed to be a comedy, but the acting and script was SO smelly that I couldn't help but laugh.  I've seen better work from kids in school plays.  Pretty sure these are the same UFO's used in countless other alien invasion movies.  But seriously . . . the acting. . . .oh the humanity!  LOL.

Busy people (or klutzes, like me!) can soooo easily mix up the two films, and there's another few quick bucks for the producer:s tiny investment.

Which is literally less than a second after hitting play. When I don't want to be bothered by room mates, I just make sure i have the audio up loud enough to be heard through my door and pop in some head phones to jam to some music, and no one bugs me for fear of wasting part of their life accidentally seeing part of this abomination. While trying to get out of conversations, I need only mention that this movie is one I've seen many times (and clarify that it isn't Independence Day) and I'm left alone. I have no idea why this movie was made, but it sure has helped me with many problems in my day to day life.",1466467200,8,780,3.911949685534591

If you don't have a big special effects budget then you try to tell a story with the dialogue, lighting and the special effects you can afford.  Independents' Day is a good guys vs. bad guys alien invasion movie that you can watch to pass some time.  The characters each have their role to keep the story moving and they fulfill their roles. It is not an iconic B movie but it has a story to tell. It's definitely not as awful as some reviews indicate.",1514160000,,514,4.161616161616162
