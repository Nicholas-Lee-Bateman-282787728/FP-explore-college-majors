8654384,5,B00JXBLMZE,"About 6 months ago, I heard the ending song to this anime (Best FriendS) via a suggested video on YouTube. I thought it looked cute, so I looked up the series and originally thought of it as a moe slice of life comedy series, a bunch of cute girls doing cute things for no reason... for 13 episodes. Sometimes, stuff like that is fun... so, I decided to put it on my ""Plan to Watch"" list on MAL (MyAnimeList). Fast forward about 3 months, and I finally decide to watch it purely out of boredom.

Yes, for the most part, the series does give off the vibe of just being a cute little girl type of moe series, and is a lot like a series full of nothing but cute girls doing cute things the entire time. However, it is MUCH more than that at times. Enough to say I was as shocked as I've ever been in my entire life after finishing this series.

To start, the series maintains a consistent storyline throughout the entirety of all 13 episodes. This series is not episodic at all. Most of the time, any slice of life moe comedy will be about 90% episodic, only needing to watch episodes in order simply because small things happen throughout the series that would leave the viewer confused if watched in an odd order. But, remove those parts, and typically, a series like that can be watched in any order; it will have absolutely no plot progression that makes it necessary to watch things in order.
That isn't the case with Love Lab at ALL. As I said above, there are times where it gives off the vibe of slice of life moe comedy, but those situations aren't constant things, and story is thrown in throughout the entire series. In short, this series is a bit of a rare find, as you're able to watch the series in its entirety and enjoy both comedy AND story. That almost never happens; most comedy series' have little to no story/plot progression.

Another thing that shines in this series is something that typically will shine in any comedy series: the characters. In a slice of life series, a good 95% of your enjoyability is going to be based on how good the characters are. Those are what shine in any series like that; they're the only ones who are keeping the series alive, since there typically is no story to be found. If the characters suck, the comedy will usually suck, and what good is a comedy series if it isn't funny?
In Love Lab, the characters shine just as well as they do in any other series. Both Riko and Maki are a couple of my favorite characters in anime, and I consider those two the SECOND BEST main character duo in all of anime that I've ever seen in my life. That's a very worthy title, as most of the time in anime, you will either see a single main character who is lackluster and nowhere near the best character in the series, or a duo of main characters in which only one is good and the other one is below average. For both to be amazing characters, enough for me to only put them behind that of Yuuji/Kazuki Kazami from Grisaia no Rakuen, is just simply marvelous. There's no other way to describe it, it's just marvelous.
To shortly add onto that, the side characters are all freaking awesome as well. I won't say more than that to avoid spoiling, but just take my word on it; they're pretty dang cool.

In addition to the amazement that is the existence of a story and the incredible characters, Love Lab also excels aesthetically. The character designs are absolutely flawless. The scenery/setting designs, while being nothing too breathtaking, are pretty incredible for a small comedy series that I doubt had a very high budget and/or a lot of people behind its creation. I also love each and every voice actor/actress; the only problem I had with those at ALL was the fact that some sounded a bit too old for the character they were voicing. Like, at times, Maki sounds like she could be mistaken for a 30 year old lady through the phone. Otherwise, the voice actors/actresses were pretty much flawless. I also appreciated the soundtrack of this series in general. Music is made to be emotionally stimulating in both happy ways and sad ways. The opening/ending songs are also extremely addictive, as well has having pretty good looking animation behind them (especially at the end of the last episode... marvelous).

To close off this review, I'll just say that Love Lab is one of my all time favorite series'. Going into it thinking it'd just be a cute little moe slice of life comedy I'd be watching for no reason other than boredom definitely left me even more satisfied and shocked than I probably would have been otherwise. The series exceeds in almost everything; story, characters, design, tropes, presentation, and leaving their audience satisfied and, sometimes, shocked.

Overall, using my unnecessarily in-depth scoring method, I rate Love Lab a 9.31/10 overall, but using just my own personal enjoyment, I rate Love Lab a 10/10. I also consider it my 3rd favorite series of all time.

Other than the sometimes off age scaling in the voice actors/actresses, there is only one flaw that I found in Love Lab at all. Other than the obvious fact that it's only 13 episodes with no sequel, the one flaw in the series is the story. Although I did praise the fact that it was able to have a story, despite the genre it's in, the story isn't the most amazing thing ever. It's an above average storyline overall, but nothing too great. It's just amazing that the story exists, and that's enough to be satisfied.

I would definitely recommend you pick up this series and watch it... it's DEFINITELY worth the money!

Thanks for reading and I hope this review helped!

8654385,4,B00JXBLMZE,"""Love Lab"" is a very unique ""moe"" slice-of-life series. Instead of having no plot at all and running entirely on girls doing cute/funny stuff, this one has continuity. It's a story about a group of girls who never experienced any love in their lives and together forms a secret club about sharings tips and tricks to get the one you love to notice you. Whetever the respective episode introduces a new character, disaster and/or potential partners, there's always something dragging the story further. At the end, you'll be very pleased with the outcome. It's something you'll be wondering about, but are not sure if they'll ever talk about it due to the comedic nature of this show. Regarding the jokes, it's a fast paced gag comedy like you're used to in Anime. Most of the jokes are verbal instead of slapstick, something that's always good. There's also not too many ""lost in translation"" jokes either, so it's great even for viewers not accustomed to Japanese culture.

Every character is likeable with their own unique personality and the intro/ending themes are some of the cutest I've heard in years. The animation is fantastic and really shines in high definition. The sound has great mixing as well, it'll do very good with speakers. As this was made with HD sources, both the audio and video are crystal clear. There's no other way to experience this show than in HD.",1422230400,3,1378,4.814345991561181
