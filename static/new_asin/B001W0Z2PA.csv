8346855,5,B001W0Z2PA,"This dvd instructs and explains the art of Trapping and Countering in the system of Jeet Kune Do (The art of the Intercepting Fist).
It teaches Advance Trapping Drills and concepts. It is presented in a casual form. It is not presented as a traditional martial art setting (no uniforms and belts). Just like Bruce Lee would have taught it. This instruction is a good expression of Bruce Lee's Concept of HIA (Hand Immobilization Attacks). Some techniques are taken from Chinese Wing-Chun Gung-Fu and some from Kali. The PAK-SAO and LOP-SAO drills are dynamic. I enjoyed this dvd because I found it instructive, clear, interesting and entertaining. I hope you do too.",1394755200,,666,4.955357142857143
