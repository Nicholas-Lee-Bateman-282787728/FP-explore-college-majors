I'm not the kind of person who usually does this review stuff so I hope you take this  seriously. The episodes provided in this latest 3 pack are some of the  wussiest shows they could pick. They are very girlish (all the shows have  one or more female joes or friends as the main protagonist). I'm not saying  anything against females but rather, I spent my money for some gun fighting  and action that the typical Joe stuff had. This is not that kind of a video  set. If you have to have some more Joe videos, by all means get a copy of  this. However, if you are like me and enjoy the action and excitement of  the show, you may not enjoy this set very much at all.",953769600,7,792,4.097402597402597
