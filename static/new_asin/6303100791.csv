The entire cast measured up to the beauty, grace, and strength of Makarova and Baryshnikov and van Hamel. Absolutely exquisite!",1504396800,,284,4.509803921568627

7838963,5,6303100791,"I have to agree with all reviewers here.  This version of Giselle is absolutely stunning and ruins it for every other Giselle out there, including but not limited to Alicia Alonso.  Martine Van Hamel's performance I thought was flawless and her lack of emotion in Act 2 in her portrayal of Myrtha was divine.  I don't think I've seen a better Myrtha than Martine in all honesty.  Sadly, I have never been blessed with having seen a live performance by Natalia or Mikhail of any ballet, but do own this particular VHS that I purchased at the America Ballet Theater gift shop after a performance of Giselle by Alessandra Ferri and Julio Boca.  Leslie Browne (The Turning Point) portrayed Myrtha.  Not a bad one at that I must admit.

I always wonder why a DVD for this particular performance was and has never been offered in DVD format.  I have not been able to play my tape since my VHS player bit the big one.  I have had to watch on youtube for a fix, which as you know, divides the performance in I don't know ... 100 pieces.  Who makes these decisions on converting VHS to DVD ... Please have mercy on us fans !!!  :)",1285718400,2,1121,4.367149758454106
7838964,5,6303100791,"We saw Makarova dancing this part years ago and it almost spoiled ballet for me because she was perfect.  Anyone who came after her seemed amateurish to me.  She dances with feeling and plasticity,a very different style than say, Fonteyn who is technically perfect but does not convey the emotion.  This is definitely a collector's item.  She is to ballet what Torville and Dean are to iceskating.",1262995200,2,397,4.880597014925373
7838965,5,6303100791,"This version of Giselle is the benchmark to judge all Giselles.  What sets this Giselle apart from all the others are the extensions that both Baryshnikov & Makarova put into their technical performances. Martine van Hamel, well, I'm in love with her, and her performance is simply the best Myrtha I have ever witnessed, expressing the correct demeanour matched only by her phenomenal technical performance considering that she is not exactly a petite ballerina--that is what makes her performance extraordinarily amazing!  It is for the performance of Myrtha by Hamel that I am drawn time and again to this Giselle excluding, of course, the famous variation of Giselle in the second act that only Makarova has done to perfection.  However, Hamel puts on such a consistently well executed performance of extrenuous movements throughout her entire retinue that I am literally drawn to tears of overwhelming emotion, just as I am drawn to tears by Makarova's performance in the first act.  There are a few flaws in this American production, one committed by Baryshnikov which is still difficult for me to understand how it could have happened being that it is a simple movement during the Grand Pas de deux.  The Corps de Ballet is also a little lacking, especially in the Pas de deux scene between the two Willis, where the timing of the movement is off from the orchestra.  What really makes this ballet the success that you hear from other critics is the score used by the orchestra which only accentuates the dramtic effect of the artists' performances.  If you do not own this video, get it no matter the price!  You will not regret it, even with the few flaws I've mentioned, it is still my favorite Giselle. And, if you have read other reviews of mine, you will be pleased to note that the filmography of this ballet is perfect; not once are the feet cut off by the camera during critical performances of the footwork.",1196467200,9,1923,4.806060606060606
7838966,5,6303100791,"The best Giselle I've ever seen on stage or recorded in decades!. Makarova is not only a ballerina, but a true musical butterfly!!!

Despite the poor quality of the video, there is no price for such an overwhelming item! Makarova is the best Giselle since... since ever. And Barishnikov even matches the historical Nureyuev, with less romantic (?) affections.

Simply, a must to have!!!",1131926400,7,386,5.015625
7838967,5,6303100791,"This performance of Giselle was perfection from beginning to end, not only from Baryshnikov and Makarova but the corps de ballet also gave a perfect performance.",1124582400,3,161,5.230769230769231
7838968,5,6303100791,"This is an amazing version of Giselle - and my favorite. It was taped live in NY in 1977, with Baryshnikov & Makarova, Martine van Hamel as Myrta, Frank Smith as Hilarion, Marianna Tcherkassky and Kirk Peterson in the peasant pas de deux, Jolanda Menendez & Nannette Glushak as Moyna & Zulma. Baryshnivov is amazing to watch, not only because of his technique, but also because of his artistry. Makarova is every bit as good as he is and together they are simply stunning both in the technical aspects of their performance and in their ability to project the emotional power of the story. It's wonderful to see two such talented artists at the height of their powers, so totally commited to their artistry. The whole cast is excellent. This has been out of print for a long time, grab it if you can find it",1093219200,20,806,4.527397260273973
7838969,5,6303100791,"This ballet is great. It is the best ballet that is romantic. I give this particular video of ""Giselle"" a 5 because it is outstanding. The second act with the Willis put you to chills. I would say this is my favorite ballets and coming from a dancer a very well done one too.",1010793600,4,275,4.111111111111111
