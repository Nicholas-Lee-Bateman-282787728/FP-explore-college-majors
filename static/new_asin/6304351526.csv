One that does just tell a wonderful story without anyone dying, without horror and, of course, without cynicism?  Well - Gold Diggers :  Secret of Bear Mountain is one of the few movies that fulfil those  requirements. It's all about true friendship and it's a very emotional  movie, that'll really touch your soul.  It's shows that nothing on earth is  worth more than real friendship and that sometimes you shouldn't trust in  what others say about somebody - you might miss one of the greatest  friendships ever. In my oppinion this movie is one of the best ever, and I  hope that there will be a lot of similar movies in the future.  I simply  love it. True, clear and full of friendship. See it or die.",934070400,6,788,4.328767123287672

7869168,5,6304351526,I have seen this movie once on ABC.  I loved it.  Then I searched for hours on amazon because I couldn't remember the name.  I finally found it and have searched on different occasions for a DVD version.  This is a must see for all families.  I hope it comes out on DVD soon!!,1205020800,,276,4.037037037037037
7869169,5,6304351526,"I don't know why I enjoyed this movie so much the first time I saw it, but it was memorable enough that, to this day, I cannot change the channel when it is on. It's definitely one of the most suspenseful kids' movies I've seen- and even if they won't admit it, I bet even adults who watch it hold their breaths in anticipation towards the end. It certainly didn't get the greatest critic reviews, but you've definitely gotta give this movie a chance- it's worth it.",1123891200,4,466,4.367816091954023
7869170,5,6304351526,"Anna and Christina are two of the best child actresses I've ever seen act together. This movie symbolizes the meaning of true friendship. By the way, does anyone know when and if it will come out on DVD?",1087689600,13,203,4.368421052631579
7869171,4,6304351526,"It was on Disney when I saw it, and I thought it to be good entertainment.  There are 'things' that  are wrong with it of course but if you can over look those on-site flaws, it's fine.  It was one of the good ones but then  I have to watch what is on broadcast TV; I don't do theaters.  I would say  the age range would be young, and grandparent age (mine) but anyone might  like it.  I was young once and so I enjoyed the partnership the two had in  the version I saw.",963705600,,470,3.863157894736842
