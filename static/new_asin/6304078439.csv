7861446,5,6304078439,"Contained some rare moments, very funny and great script with good acting. Brings a sense of Britain to the states.",1388361600,,115,4.8
7861447,5,6304078439,"A real gem from the 50s UK film productions era. Starring a lesser known Rich Burton and others. A fun little movie with the classic British sense of humor.

A little story based on smuggling and avoiding the taxman in the early 1950s.",1357948800,,235,4.465116279069767
7861448,5,6304078439,"My order arrived two (2) days after it was ordered! Needless to say, I was elated. My video was shrink-wrapped & in perfect condition. What a joy it was (and will continue to be) to watch a film that I have waited a long time to re-see (I used to rent it from time to time when neighborhoods had video stores -- mine was wonderful). My thanks for both the film & the seller.",1305158400,,374,4.0675675675675675
7861449,4,6304078439,"Please ignore the other review for this title, as that reviewer based his comments on a very inferior ep/6-hour mode version. The Home Vision version - the one with the predominantly green cover, with b&w cast photos - is of excellent quality, recorded in the SP/2-hour mode, digitally mastered and with very good sound quality.

The film itself, though not an actual Ealing comedy, is very much in that mold, along the lines of ""Tight Little Island"" (aka ""Whiskey Galore!""); if you enjoyed that movie, you will like this one a lot too. Plus it has a very young Honor 'Pussy Galore' Blackman paired up with a young Richard Burton. And there's Roger Livesey, too, from ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp""! All around, a most enjoyable post-WWII British comedy.",1221436800,5,761,4.809160305343512
7861450,4,6304078439,"This light hearted comedy is a classic from 1951.  It stars a very young Richard Burton.  Burton plays the part of a leader in a ""somewhat"" secret society that bootlegs liquor into Great  Britain.  A sudden storm brings their centurys old ploy to light leaving a  large fishing boat aground.  Ex-wifes, new girl friends, tax officials all  play a part in this ""they don't make them like they used to""  classic comedy.  A ""must"" for old movie afficienados.  Delightful!  Suitable for all ages.",962323200,7,492,4.807228915662651
