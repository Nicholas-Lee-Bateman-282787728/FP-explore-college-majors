8311064,4,B0012RD3YK,"This series manages to be entertaining and laugh out loud funny without addressing the story every volume. While this series continues to make me laugh, there is still concern that they are going to run out of time to introduce the story and get us through the second half effectively. Hopefully the close of this half is foreshadowing something good in the coming episodes. In the meantime though, this series is worth just sitting back and enjoying. The writing is sharp and its clever nature warrants continued viewing.",1216684800,2,522,4.943181818181818
