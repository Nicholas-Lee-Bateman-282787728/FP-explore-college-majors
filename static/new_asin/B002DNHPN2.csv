8365562,2,B002DNHPN2,I think this was a genuine exhibit of a groups search for the Supernatural -  but again mostly based on what a medium has to say rather than real evidence.  There were a few of the group who really made sense but the DVD fell short of producing anything other than what came out of the mind of a human being who probably researched the sites before he did the investigation.  Please don't misunderstand - I do believe mediums have there place but this DVD relied too much on his observations with nothing to prove what he was seeing in his mind. Again too much attention to orb activity even with one member stating she could see a face in one of the orbs - give me a break - she needs to do her homework. Another don't waste your money.  This two DVD set even has a segment of wathcing and listening to juvenile banter between members of this group which were not funny and truly unprofessional - I would 't want them investigating any paranormal activity for me or my friends.,1270684800,7,978,4.327868852459017

Ronald James did an outstanding job, aided by the gifted  Robbie Thomas and the other very talented investigators from Indiana Ghost Trackers!",1251331200,10,253,5.170731707317073
