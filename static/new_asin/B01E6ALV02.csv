7731253,1,B01E6ALV02,"Im so tired of movies that just flat out fail being repackaged and sold as ""arthouse"" that the common person ""just doesnt understand"". The only flash of good movie making here was the final two scenes and thats only because of allstar talent in front of the camera. Everything prior to that scene might be the most vapid thing i suffer through all year. Theres no depth to the characters. The story is as old as story telling. The flow is all over the place. It felt like i missed the prequel and or needed a sequel. There were several points that i wasn't even sure if i was watching a flashback or real time. Which would be fine if the dialog was engaging enough that i wasn't able to have thirty different mind processes running at once but holy hell i was bored. It was like actually being at the psychologist. Its just flat out lanier and no amount of artsy cinematography changes that. Anyone who thinks this is good is either simple or pretentious and should get a job as an elitist critic.",1473292800,2,997,4.394594594594595

7731265,4,B01E6ALV02,"""It doesn't matter what I want cause I have a contract, and you know what, I'll tell you something. They picked the wrong guy because I'm just an ordinary kid."" Hopper (Simmons) is a star baseball pitcher that has recently been demoted after a shaky outing. He is sent to psychologist Dr. Mobley (Giamatti) in hopes of him figuring out what is wrong. When Hopper begins to talk about his overbearing father (Hawke) Mobley begins to understand what Hopper's problem is. But it may be too late. I am a huge sucker for all sports movies and I love Paul Giamatti so I was really excited about watching this. I have to say though this is nothing like I expected. At the risk of over simplifying, the movie is basically a baseball player version of Good Will Hunting. Simmons actually plays the part perfect as a kid who isn't sure what he wants anymore and is essentially going though the motions while his dad tries to totally control him. I could keep going on about this but if you liked Good Will Hunting I would recommend this as well. Overall, not what I expected, it was better. I give this a B+.",1470182400,,1098,4.4405940594059405
7731266,3,B01E6ALV02,"Imagine a sensitive, genuine portrayal of Major League's Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn's struggles on the mound and it might look something like The Phenom. Written and directed with the analytical precision of a psychotherapist by Noah Buschel, the film is about a young baseball pitcher, Hopper Gibson (an unrecognizable Johnny Simmons), who isn't living up to his immense potential. While ostensibly about baseball, or any sport where victory rests heavily on the shoulders of an individual, there is very little actual gameplay involved.  In that respect The Phenom is unlike nearly every other sports movie out there.

Buschel doesn't even bother setting things up, thrusting us right in the middle of Hopper's therapy session with Dr. Mobley (Paul Giamatti), a sports therapist hired to sort out his pitching woes. It's a bit jarring, actually, but that effect is what Buschel is going for. It fits the disorientation Hopper must be feeling as a promising 18-year-old superstar with a 98 mph heater, who suddenly finds himself incapable of finding the plate. Much of the story plays out in flashback as Mobley tries to get to the root of Hopper's problem. We see him growing up as a kid who isn't particularly bright but incredibly talented, and that's enough for him to coast through school. We see various girlfriends, including one who is an uber-liberal and totally unimpressed by his impending celebrity status and wealth. Hopper doesn't understand her; isn't being rich and famous what this whole thing has been about?

Certainly that's the lesson his father, the dysfunctional and demanding Hopper Sr. (Ethan Hawke, grungy and tatted up, basically the polar opposite of his Boyhood role) would want his son to learn. Hopper Sr. is a piece of work, a petty criminal who sees in his son the talent he once had and squandered. He won't let his son fail, even if he has to beat the greatness out of him. His first night home from prison is spent ridiculing Hopper and diminishing his accomplishments...

""You threw 98 mph? Bet you think you're astonishing.""

When Hopper Sr. isn't putting his son down he's hitting him with beer cans or forcing him to run suicides late into the evening. He's terrible and brutal, but celebrity parents like Hopper Sr. are a reality, and the damage they do to their offspring is just as real. What's interesting about Buschel's film is that he isn't willing to write off Hopper Sr. completely as the cause of Hopper's problems. There's recognition that his demands, as horrible as they may appear on the surface, probably did contribute to Hopper's early success. It may not be as much as Hopper Sr. thinks, given his obvious delusions of grandeur. But clearly Hopper wouldn't be where he is without his father's heavy-handed guidance.

Buschel is interested in the character study of an athlete, pure and simple, and he takes his time making the examination. The film moves along at an unreasonably slow pace, so much so that 90-minutes feel like a 9-inning baseball game, plus overtime. There are revelations about Dr. Mobley that emerge, and they echo some of what Hopper is going through, but ultimately they don't matter that much. Nor do we ever really see the impact of these sessions on the field. Is Hopper...fixed?  Buschel may not be concerned with the answer to that question, but anyone who bothers to sit through The Phenom will want to know if Hopper is hurling strikes or giving up home runs.",1470182400,,3445,4.90893470790378

8757782,1,B01E6ALV02,"Hopper Gibson (Johnny Simmons) is in a position that every little boy dreams about. He is a star rookie pitcher in Major League Baseball. His numbers and talent are off the chart, when all of a sudden, he can't find the strike zone. There is nothing wrong with him physically, so the team sends him down to the minors and puts him to work with the top sports psychologist in the country. I really don't understand professional critics and what they look for when they rate a film. Take The Phenom for example, this film has got to be the slowest and most boring sports film I've ever seen, yet it has an 80 on Rotten Tomatoes. There was very little sports action in this film and the fast majority of it consisted of this guy sitting in a room talking to a shrink! Yes, the shrink was played by Paul Giamatti, who is an unbelievably talented actor, but why the hell would anyone want to watch some dudes therapy session? When he wasn't in therapy, he should be on the field, but no, he's dealing with his over barring father, who is fresh out of prison. Who plays this bad ass, bullying his pro-athlete son, who is in peak physical condition? A very old looking, very tattooed, Ethan Hawke and I really wasn't buying that for a second. There were some talented actors in this film, no doubt, but The Phenom was 88 minutes of talking and nothing more, what in the hell is so great about that? This film was as boring as movies get, so unless you're a die hard Paul Giamatti fan, I would absolutely let this one pass you by.",1517356800,,1522,4.343859649122807

8757788,5,B01E6ALV02,"I greatly enjoyed this movie about a young pitcher who has to sit down with a shrink to try and regain control of not just his fast ball but his life. As the great Yogi Berra said '50 % of the game is half mental,' and this is especially so when dealing with the fragile psyches' of the young men who inhabit the often lonely mounds of major league baseball stadiums. This movie goes partway towards exploring why too many of them fail to master the mental game of pitching. And why the minor leagues are littered with the broken remains of the careers of bonus babies and high draft picks who failed to head the advise of the great Yogi.",1480464000,,638,4.2809917355371905

The problem is, the film has no ending.  It is as if the producers ran out of money at the end of Act 2, and just decided to put out the film without a 3rd Act.  It's only 85 minutes long, which is a big clue.  A plot requires a beginning, a middle, and an end, and this show has little of any.  Without a plot line, it becomes simply a series of scenes between the player and the therapist, where the encounter between the baseball player and the muggers becomes utterly irrelevant and useless.  We see him in therapy, we see his interaction with his father (who verbally bullies, but never outright abuses him), and then -- that's it!  No story!",1477267200,,807,4.405405405405405
