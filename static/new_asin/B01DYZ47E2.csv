Laugh all you want. even point to the one's you think are impossibly stupid and Hollywood's over done, but they exist at Basic Training and they're weeded out or squashed into little green squares. All gun toting, boot licking, soldiers.",1534982400,,384,4.746268656716418

8757379,1,B01DYZ47E2,Old movie with very little plot. Almost comedic look at airborne troops as they go though jump school etc.. May have been ok movie back when it was made. Not worth the $2.99 rental,1467331200,,180,4.323529411764706
8757380,2,B01DYZ47E2,"I assumed this would be a WW2 movie, but it is set in the beatnik era.  References are made to WW2, but there are no action scenes.  The whole movie is about jump school.  Sappy music and predictable storyline.",1463875200,,210,4.333333333333333
