7803371,5,6300157822,"I'm not going to lie to you, I've always had a reputation as a great actor, but I outdid myself in this picture. What didn't I do in this flick. I finally exposed Tom Wopat for the hack he is. I showed a range of emotions, the ability to be an action hero and a side that appeals to the ladies.

Do youself a favor and rent it because I'm one brilliant talking bear.",1086307200,5,565,4.192660550458716
