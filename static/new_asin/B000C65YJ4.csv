8095790,4,B000C65YJ4,"If you grew up in the '50s and '60s, then this series on the birth and death of the Muscle Car era is for you. This series documents the heavy metal, high horsepower, flamboyant cars we grew up driving, admiring and lusting after. Cars named Camaro, Mustang, GTO, Roadrunner, Daytona, Corvette, and Cobra are just a few of the cars featured in Series One, Two and Three DVD sets with historical film and interviews with current owners and experts. It's a MUST HAVE for any automobile fan. I didn't give it 5 Stars only because I wish the programs were longer and offered a little more detail and technical information. Special thanks to Mr. Kearns in a previous review alerting us to a less expensive source for this series. Thus I took his advice and ordered it from MPI Home Video. (Sorry Amazon ... some of your pricing is beyond my budget.) No matter where you purchase it, this documentary series is the best compilation ever produced on the Muscle Car.",1369008000,,958,4.608187134502924

8095793,5,B000C65YJ4,Nice thorough overview of each American muscle car. Packed with some little known history to most. Brings back a lot of memories of what we used to have on the roads. Classic beautiful cars. A joy to watch. Good commentary. Good quality DVD.,1304899200,,241,4.627906976744186
8095794,3,B000C65YJ4,"The Video is good quality and is a collection of shows that were on SPEED Chanel over the past few years with the commercials removed. However, the Amazon price of $26.99 is way out of line. The exact video is available on line at MPI home Video for $14.95.",1297296000,,257,4.26530612244898
8095795,5,B000C65YJ4,"A friend of mine told me about this show. Thought I would try the DVD, rather than tv, and avoid the commercials. I purchased this set as they included the Camaro's and Chevelle's (my two personal favorite musclecars). I had no expectations when purchasing this DVD set, and for the amount of time given for each episode, found it very informative. This only covers the basics (does not include any parts numbers, merely some options and power ratings). Also, is does not cover the Z/28 Camaron (although I wasn't looking for this specifically). But it does show a little on the COPO Camaro. If you're already a musclecar fan, and know features inside and out, it might be a little disappointing. For me, I've never seen the cars from the Musclecar era on the dragstrip, and it was interesting to watch those video clips.",1215216000,4,821,4.708333333333333
8095796,4,B000C65YJ4,"Like other reviewer, I had not heard of this series because it wasn't shown in Australia, but I'm glad I bought this (and series 2 and 3, which I am yet to watch).
If you love American muscle cars then this is a must, with excellent historical information and footage, good new video on restored and original cars, and good (but not great) sound quality. I thought I knew a lot about Muscle Cars but this gave me a whole stack of new information to increase my appreciation of this great era in automotive history.
I don't mind the narration interspersed with interviews with owners and experts, however there is just a little too much of re-showing the same footage a couple of times in each episode.
I recommend this series strongly to anyone with an interest in cars.",1205798400,4,770,4.546762589928058
8095797,5,B000C65YJ4,"My only complaint is it doesn't last long enough.

Hurry up with Series 2 will you??",1147392000,3,84,4.25
