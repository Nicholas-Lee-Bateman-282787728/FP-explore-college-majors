I was a big fan of Set 1 and Set 2 is not a disappointment, if anything it is even better.",1353801600,2,141,3.8620689655172415
7768525,5,B01GWCD1XM,"Detective Vera Stanhope has...issues.  You pick up on them quietly, because Vera is as likely to use them to her advantage as not.  She's a cuddly-looking motherly type who calls you ""Dearie"" and ""love"".  Don't you be taken in.  If you're a crook, she'll obsess over your infractions so intensely that you haven't got a prayer.  If you're her colleague, well....you're in for a rough ride.

You'll recognize plump middle-aged Brenda Blethyn from films such as the Knightly Pride and Prejudice, where her scatterbrained, pale, fluffy boule de suif of a Mrs. Bennett almost redirected the entire picture.  Here, she's like your concerned landlady, pouring you tea before she gets the razor out and redoes your face.  She's magic.  It's absolutely unexpected.

But all is not well in either her heart or a shivery Northumberland.  Daddy did some of the damage.  So did the force.  Her dishy sidekick colleague, who wants to avoid the almost clichd failed cop marriage, isn't likely to succeed.  His boss insists on total committment, both in time and focus, at all hours of the day.  If you slack the least bit, she's likely to sack you.

You know, just to make sure you're paying attention. Just to remind you that she comes first.

I don't remember much about the actual mystieries because I was so taken in by the dysfuncional yet neccessary characterization.  Northumberland comes off as a handsome hero--saturnine, chilly, perpetually autumnal. This is so worth it for those who wish to be kidnapped by character and personality.  I can't wait for #2!

Eratum: Whoops!  I meant to put this review under Vera #1!  But I've seen #2, and it still applies.  Recently, British imports have been depressing, amoral and filmed as if through a blue gel, like ""The Ring"", only without the thrills (actually, the British have been worried about this, too).  This series is different, and well worth tracking down.",1349395200,17,1905,4.918238993710692
7768526,5,B01GWCD1XM,"DCI Vera is rough, untidy, obsessed, but softens a bit in Set 2. She's a female Columbo. Her health is showing her age. But she's a determined sleuth. This new series has four episodes [WITH SUBTITLES] each a bit longer than the previous season. Teens and older recommended due to violent disturbing scenes. The characterss are adapted after mystery novels by Ann Cleeves. The Northumberland filming locale, also the story settings, (the same place as Catherine Cookson stories) is delightful. Cases are as violent as the country is beautiful. Vera's tough enough for the job, most days.

Brenda Blethyn (Atonement, Pride & Prejudice) as Vera, convincingly leads the team. DS Joe (David Leon) is the young family man and Vera's assistant. His wife joins this series in 3 episodes and is played by Sonya Cassidy.  Forensics and some very funny dialogue is covered by Cartwright (Paul Ritter). DC Kenny (Jon Morrison) also returns as an older team member. DC Holly returns but lasts only through the first episode. This nucleus cop cast questions guest stars playing criminals and victims. Really strong acting casts in every episode, too many to mention.

SUBTITLES available/optional for all episodes.
~~~1___The Ghost Position Vera's 1st Sgt's daughter Stella (Jessica Barden) is in a coma after an arson attack. Vera looks into the next tragedy after learning her mentor never quite accepted divorce from Marianne (Julie Graham- Bonekickers) who married Gower (Ron Cook- Little Dorrit).  Another guest star, rose Leslie (Dowton Abbey) plays Lena. It's a sad case. DC Holly also gets Vera-punched.
~~~2___Silent Voices  Is a murdered social worker Jenny & a mother-drowned child suspiciously linked? A dead author's manuscript might offers clues, once found. The soc. Worker's daughter Hanna (Hannah Britland) and Connie Masters (Kaye Wragg) are key people needed for the inquiry.
~~~3___Sandancers Is an Afgan hero's death, a medalist from the Sundancers regiment, a suicide? Will a confession result from the help of MP Capt Shep (Clare Calbraith- Downton Abbey)? It gets confusing, even to the victim's wife Laura (Naomi Bentley). Vera and angina are still together. Other guest stars to watch for include Keith Barton (Simon Chandler- Land Girls, King's Speech), his wife Diane (Barbara Marten- Kidnap and Ransom), and Lt. Col. Chapell (John Duttine).
~~~4___A Certain Samaritan A body falls from a bridge atop a lorry ended up 300 miles away in Portsmouth. Victim's employer Marty (John McArdle) and mother Shirley (Phyllis Logan- Downton Abbey) find no answers that help as the man was a perfect employee and son. Of course Vera can't quite agree. During the case, Joe finds a name to Vera's dad's last female friend. Maggie (Judy Parfitt- Little Dorrit, Girl with a Pearl Earing). That's a perfect set-up for commissioned season three.",1347580800,15,2843,5.225877192982456
7768527,5,B01GWCD1XM,"Filmed as if Vermeer's paintings darkly came to life, in clouded northern light with nuanced shades of human emotion, ""Vera: Set 2"" is a tremendous visual and imaginative treat. Always superb, Brenda Blethyn is the driving, elemental force that is Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope: salt of the earth. Blethyn's face is as expressive and interesting as the blustery northern English landscape, weathering storms of conflict within and without. DCI Vera Stanhope's unresolved pathos over her lonely life, the loss of her father, and a mother she barely knew, underline the narrative. Slugging down whisky under sullen clouds, Vera once declared that solitude is not for the faint-hearted. In the U.K., theater, movie, and television productions value actors who are robustly, deeply human, and provide venues like this series that share this wealth of talent. Northumberland is another character, its rolling hills and rough coastline, the heavy line of the sea, castle ruins, and towns hit hard by decades of economic hardship, providing a unique canvas for these fine stories. Northumberland's rich nouns and dialect is as hefty and delicious as meat-pies and ale. Blocks of row-houses huddle under a leaden sky that slams down at the end of the street, a permanent dead-end. Northumberland's soft northern light and wave-tossed seascapes provide a timelessness to the human narrative strewn upon the landscape.

With incredible acting talent, the marvelous Brenda Blethyn is amazing as Vera, she and the rest of the talented crew authentically bring alive the mystery novels of Ann Cleves. David Leon is excellent as Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, his character suffers Vera's dark moods with relatively calm equanimity. The series is further enlivened by a great cast. Wunmi Mosaku is wonderful as smart Detective Constable Holly Lawson, who finally submits her resignation after being browbeaten by Vera one too many times. Jon Morrison plays long-suffering Detective Constable Kenny Lockhart, Cush Jumbo is Detective Constable Bethany Whelan, Paul Ritter is great as the creepy Pathologist Billy Cartwright, and Sonya Cassidy perfectly depicts Sergeant Joe Ashworth's long-suffering wife, Celine Ashworth. A slew of fine guest-stars include: Ron Cook, Penny Downie, Julie Graham, Phyllis Logan, John McArdle, Nina Sosanya, and Emily Woof.

The best mysteries transcend the genre to encompass a wide range of life-issues, ""Vera"" explores this complexity beautifully. The four episodes include: ""The Ghost Position,"" ""Silent Voices,"" ""Sandancers,"" and ""A Certain Samaritan."" Vera's personal demons remain unresolved. These cases unearth old secrets about a previous colleague's disturbing private life, the British army's wall of silence involving tragic losses in Afghanistan, the damage to a family caused by addiction, and secrets about Vera's past that threaten to disrupt whatever hard-won equilibrium she has gained. Please note: subtitles are helpfully provided.

The Ghost Position
DCI Vera Stanhope's prior colleague, Sergeant Stuart Macken, is badly burned while rescuing his daughter after his home is fire-bombed in an arson attack. Poor Vera goes to hospital to visit her old friend, and whist she innocently tries to buy him some coffee, he suddenly limps to a hospital balcony and commits suicide. In the same hospital where he ends his life, his daughter fights for life. Vera's investigation points to multiple suspects, including: a protester and the protestor's pregnant girlfriend, a coworker Macken had an affair with, and his daughter's smug stepfather. Even in hospital recuperating from her critical injuries, Macken's daughter isn't safe, and an attempt is made on her life.

Silent Voices
A vital, strong swimmer is brutally murdered during one of her ""wild"" outdoor swims, leaving her daughter unstrung by grief. The investigation reveals that the victim was a social service worker who'd been involved in a terrible, shocking case involving the death of a child who drowned in a bath. Vera and Joe locate another social worker whose life was ruined by the notoriety of the early case; she was blamed for not catching that the child was at-risk. It appears that there are no safe refuges, even a local gym, when Vera finds one of the suspects dead. Meanwhile, Sergeant Joe Ashworth continues to struggle balancing work and his home-life.

Sandancers
Secrets, revenge, and the war Afghanistan are elements leading to the murder of Staff Sergeant Deverson. He was a specialist in a bomb disposal unit, whose second-in-command, Ollie, had been killed by an improvised explosive device. An army bureaucrat insists that the death is a suicide, while evidence reveals all is not what it seems. Other deaths follow, in the same pattern, while the army base closes ranks during Vera's investigation. The trauma of events in Afghanistan form the backdrop for a vivid story.

A Certain Samaritan
Never at ease with the past, Vera's dead father continues to plague her. She keeps discovering odd bitas and opeices left behind and hidden in her father's old house (now hers), bags of objects hidden under floorboards, old cassette tapes with a woman singing. In the course of a murder investigation, Detective Joe Ashworth gives Vera the address of her father's old paramour. In Newcastle, a bloody shoe is foundl; it turns out to match another on a murder victim discovered in a Northumberland truck-stop dumpster. It turns out that the victim, Niall Coulter, had plenty of money remaining in his wallet, someone's stolen credit card, and traces of heroin in his bloodstream. All the puzzles of past and present converge to force Vera to face truths about herself, while unearthing how/why Niall was murdered. His mother is no help whatsoever. The most unlikely and mysterious element in this episode must be noted: if that ol' ex-girlfriend of Vera's father was able to actually bear a child in the mid-1980s, she lived a very hard life indeed to look quite as elderly as she does now. No insult intended to the aged, as I am one of 'em, and getting more so every day!

Thankfully, ""Vera"" was renewed for a 3rd season, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-3/dp/B00GAXASK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera: Set 3</a>&nbsp;due out in January 2014.

Hopefully the series will continue for many more seasons, with quick-tempered, cantankerous DCI Vera Stanhope.

7768548,5,B01GWCD1XM,"I absolutely love ""Vera"". My husband and I really enjoy British murder mysteries. Vera is my favorite.  She is a no nonsense straight forward type DCI. She isn't about glamour. She isn't dressed as a fashion model in heels physically running after criminals. The plots are intriguing and hard to figure who has committed the crimes.

7768552,4,B01GWCD1XM,"Vera Series 2 was first broadcast on ITV in 2012. DCI Vera Stanhope of the Northumberland and City police is based on the character in Anne Cleeves detective novels, but only one of the episodes, Silent Voices, is based on a novel. The other three are original stories written by Paul Rutman or Colin Teevan. DCI Stanhope is cranky, overbearing, a little slovenly, and often inconsiderate toward her co-workers. Her clumsy pig-headedness, conveyed unselfconsciously by Brenda Blethyn, lends the series an air of authenticity. DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon), with whom Vera works most closely, and his wife Celine (Sonya Cassidy) return from Series 1, as do amusingly inappropriate pathologist Dr. Billy Cartwright (Paul Ritter) and DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison). Unfortunately, DC Holly Lawson (Wunmi Mosaku) leaves after the first episode, replaced by DC Bethany Whelan (Cush Jumbo). A Certain Samaritan is unnecessarily convoluted, and I could do without Veras daddy-angst, but this is generally a high-quality series.

The episodes are:

The home of a former colleague, Sgt. Stuart Macken (Steven Hartley ), is struck by arson with his 18-year-old daughter Stella (Jessica Barden) inside in The Ghost Position. With Stella in a coma, her future uncertain, her father commits suicide, leaving Vera to wonder what he may have known of the motive behind the fire, as she and DS Ashworth (David Leon) investigate the crime. Veras biases are undisguised, but the investigation reveals Mackens deteriorating home life that resulted in divorce from Stellas mother Marianne (Julie Graham). Marianne and second husband Brian Gower (Ron Cook) come under suspicion, as do the participants in a violent street demonstration that included the tossing of petrol bombs, where Macken recently made several arrests. As the case unfolds, DC Holly Lawson (Wunmi Mosaku) expresses her dissatisfaction with her position on the team.

Sandancers brings Vera and DS Joe Ashworth to a military barracks to investigate the apparent suicide of Staff Sergeant James Deverson (Barry McGee). Evidence of the presence of another person at the scene and the angle of the gunshot lead the police to believe that Deverson was murdered. Deversons companions were intoxicated that night, and the base commander Lt. Col. Chapell (John Duttine) is increasingly uncooperative, leaving Vera with little to go on. After LCpl. Kevin Budgie OConner (Alex Price) expresses guilt over the death of their colleague Ollie Barton, who fell victim to an IED in Afghanistan, Vera learns that Ollies family blamed Deverson for their sons death. She begins to suspect that the motive for murder lies in whatever happened in Afghanistan. Capt. Shepherd (Clare Calbraith) from the base assists in the investigation.

An athletic and well-respected senior social worker, Jenny Lister (Stephanie Carey), is forcibly drowned while swimming in a river in Silent Voices. Jennys distraught daughter Hannah (Hannah Britland) is comforted by boyfriend Simon (James Rastall), whose patrician mother Veronica Eliot (Penny Downie) disapproves of the relationship. Lister was the senior social worker in the Elias Jones Affair years ago, in which a disturbed young mother drowned her 6-year-old son. Lister was absolved of wrongdoing, but the primary social worker Connie Masters (Kaye Wragg) was reprimanded for neglect and lost her job, providing the detectives with a suspect, until they learn that Jenny had been writing a book about some of her cases and that her handbag was stolen shortly before the murder. Vera chafes when Joe criticizes some of her decisions.

In A Certain Samaritan, the stabbed body of a man with heroin in his blood is found in a skiff outside Portsmouth Docks. Vera tries hard to make the case local, as this is outside her jurisdiction. Witnesses to a knife fight on a bridge point to the man being stabbed closer to home and falling onto a lorry travelling on the underpass below. A middle-aged woman, Shirley Culham (Phyllis Logan), comes to the station to report her 29-year-old son Niall missing, and Vera suspects he is the unidentified victim. Nialls wallet is found, leading to dying cancer patient and beekeeper Mr. Ben Guthrie (Sean Campion), who had employed Niall and from whom Niall stole. Vera becomes increasingly suspicious of Shirley, as she appears to have been a possessive, secretive mother. And Veras feelings about her father resurface when she meets his ex-mistress.",1480464000,2,4459,5.283497884344147

7768568,5,B01GWCD1XM,"DCI Vera Stanhope of Northumberland is my kind of detective. In this series 2 she has a new haircut, which is more akin to wind blown and the absence of a hairbrush. She dresses for warmth, not style, although her raincoat is fashionable, and her sturdy shoes look as if they are handmade. All this discussion of her sense or lack of style is necessary to get the full picture of this detective. She is someone you feel you can trust, however, you cannot pull the wool over her. She knows when you are lying. Vera is down to earth, dresses for warmth, eats when she can, drinks more often, and her life as a DCI is her life.

Brenda Blethyn plays Vera, and she is absolutely brilliant. She has the ability to transform herself into Vera, her actions, her speech and her essence demand respect. In this series we are privy to more information about Vera's life, as she relays bits and pieces to her new DS Joe Ashworth, played by David Leon. DC Holly Lawson is played by Wunmi Mosaku, who is feeling bullied by Vera. Jon Morrison plays long time DC Kenny Lockhart, and Paul Ritter plays Billy Cartwright, the pathologist.a

Series 2 as usual, provides the best in acting, writing and directing. The episodes are all new and reality driven. We can see this happening in any neighborhood. These episodes take place in Northumberland, the moors, the desolate places and the nicer neighborhoods. Vera has a cast of characters who are all put in their place, she wants them to work harder, do more, bring in the clues and help solve the crimes. In series 2 there are four 90 minute episodes, The Ghost Position, Silent Voices, Sandman Years, and A Certain Samaritan. I am such a fan of Brends Blythyn and Vera, and I look forward to each episode.

7768701,5,B01GWCD1XM,"VERA, Season 2. (2011- ) This is a new, contemporaneously set British television series made by ITV: it has aired in the United States on PBS channels. The British mystery/police procedural is based on the best-selling mysteries of British author Ann Cleeves, and like her work, is set in the extreme northeast of England, just under the Roman-built Hadrian's Wall, which separates England from Scotland.

The production stars two-time Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (LITTLE VOICE, SECRETS AND LIES, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, ATONEMENT) as DCI Vera Stanhope, a solitary, obsessed, caustic investigator with a messy persona and private life. She's 40 pounds overweight, a bit disheveled; dresses for comfort and warmth in the brutal Northumberland winters.  You can think female Columbo. The production is available streaming or in a boxed set that includes four feature-length, character-driven crime dramas on four discs, running approximately 370 minutes. For mature audiences only, please. And thank you, RLJ Entertainment-Acorn, it's got subtitles: otherwise don't know what we'd do with the flavorful local accent and idiom on this side of the pond. I received this as a review copy.

This series does a remarkable job of creating an entire Northeast of England world that will be unfamiliar to most viewers. These powerful free-standing episodes have been filmed in the original villages of the Cleeves crime novels; the bleak, lonely landscapes of Northumberland, a region of the U.K. that has traditionally suffered, and still does, from underemployment,  look beautiful here.  Residents of the region appear to largely live, and spend their time, in stone-built structures, frequently isolated, and its tempting to describe them as frequently stony-hearted.

Stanhope here pursues the truth in the cases of murder, kidnapping, and blackmail that occur on her patch of Geordie-land. She's driven by her own demons; fails to follow the rules of proper nutrition; hides her loneliness well; drinks more than she ought. We're told she lost her mother as a young child, was raised by a distant, eccentric father, is estranged from an only sister she never knew she had. She's a complex character: a brilliant, independent cop with a dumb private life.  Its a character that undoubtedly requires an actress of Blethyn's skill: shes a BAFTA winner, and was awarded the O.B.E. (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2003 Queen's New Year's Honours List for her services to drama.  Here, Blethyn is ably supported by her sidekick Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, as played by the locally born David Leon, (a BAFTA winner for ROCKnROLLA), who, characterizes his part with an odd, bowlegged walk, as if he were malnourished as a child and had had rickets. Also playing roles in the cop shop are Paul Ritter and Jon Morrison.  This particular series also features several well-known female guest stars, including a trio of Scottish-born actresses. Julie Graham, THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE, WILLIAM AND MARY; Phyllis Logan, SECRETS AND LIES, LOVEJOY, and the reliable  housekeeper Mrs. Hughes in DOWNTON ABBEY; and  Rose Leslie, unforgettable as Ygritte, GAME OF THRONES. Also the Yorkshire-born Judy Parfitt, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. And Nina Sosanya, memorable as Kate in LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX. The episodes are:

Disc 1
Episode 1: The Ghost Position
Vera Stanhope is reunited with her first mentor and colleague Stuart Macken after his home is firebombed, his teenage daughter badly injured. Macken has survived an apparent murder attempt; his daughter is in a coma from which she may emerge.  Yet Veras old friend then makes a tragic decision.

Disc 2
Episode 2: Silent Voices
A well-respected social worker is drowned; in her most famous case a child was drowned by his own mother. What exactly is the connection? The answer seems to lie in a book the murdered woman was writing.  Then Stanhopes prime suspect is drowned, too.

Disc 3
Episode 3: Sandancers
The Army generally doesnt like suicides, yet the authorities at a local army base are in an ungodly hurry to declare the death of a decorated Afghanistan War veteran a suicide.  Stanhope doubts it.  A fellow soldier confesses to the killing, but the detective doubts that too.  Until Budgie, the fellow soldier also commits suicide. Or did he?

Disc 4
Episode 4: A Certain Samaritan
A young man is found dead.  Heroin in his blood,  a stolen credit card in his wallet.  Stanhope and Ashworth suspect his possessive mother knew little about his life. But only when they learn details of the mothers life does a motive for murder emerge.  A significant amount of information about Veras father and early years also emerges.

I love this series. The dark and realistic crime dramas  deal with middle and lower class people, for the most part, in contrast to most glossy American cop shows, and are enhanced by  dark and moody sound tracks.  Plots are muscular, and so, uniformly, is the acting, with particular praise due Blethyn, who has created in Vera a strong yet vulnerable  character.  In further contrast to the female leads of most American TV cop shows, Vera's not young, pretty, sexy or well-dressed. She doesn't have a husband, or a lover, and doesn't seem interested in getting one. She doesnt have a social or family life and doesnt seem much interested in getting one. She's interested in getting her perps, man or woman, and she does. If you're not familiar with VERA, the episodes are free-standing, and you can just as well start with the more current series 3 and 4 as with this earlier one.  It does, however, give you a couple of clues as to Veras background.  Very highly recommended.",1408838400,3,5662,5.054838709677419

7768722,5,B01GWCD1XM,"The brilliant Brenda Blethyn is back in four more feature-length episodes of VERA.

The first series left me a bit disappointed but this time around the mix of character study and police drama works exceptionally well. Its a safe bet that while some stars have it written into their contracts to keep their wardrobe, Ms Blethyn is more likely to have a clause stipulating that her clothes must be burned at the conclusion of the series!

Dressing like a frump, however, is a stark contrast to the brilliant policing mind that Vera possesses and is quite an amusing contrast to her professionalism.

The first episode begins with Vera having a bit of a health scare. Perhaps this contributes to her being a little less abrasive than in Series One. Her struggles to come to terms with a less stressful lifestyle and a severely altered diet provide some of the shows humour and helps make Vera a more vulnerable character, thus upping the likeability factor. This is crucial, as she was a bit too cranky for her own good the first time around.

The cinematography continues to be first class and the storylines are well-plotted.  Several landscapes look like paintings they are so beautiful, and yet they are never intrusive, rather creating the effect of subtle irony that such terrible things as murder could happen in places that are so picturesque.

Definitely possessing a more matronly tone in this series, Vera must cope with the loss of two colleagues in the first episode. This has the effect of deepening her maternal/mentor relationship with her Sergeant, Joe Ashworth, played by David Leon. Its an interesting relationship and we come to care about their future together. Leon has the opportunity to undertake a very heroic and dangerous rescue in the second episode and Veras worry as she witnesses it is palpable.

Episode three, involving the suicide (or is it murder?) of a veteran of the war in Afghanistan continues the high standards set by episodes one and two. But episode four is especially intriguing as it reveals some tidbits about Veras life that illuminate her character. Her relationship with her trusted Sergeant also deepens.

VERA has been commissioned for a third series, so fans of the show have much to look forward to. As Acorn Media continues to grow as a major distributor of quality programming, VERA can most definitely be counted as another feather in their cap.",1397433600,,2399,4.906172839506173

In Season two (2), DCI Vera Blenching (brilliantly acted by Brenda Blethyn), the lead investigating detective, solves some very puzzling, confusing and difficult cases in Northern England that sometimes intrude into Vera's ""loner"" existence.

Although Vera seems a little bit ""warmer"" (she does smile more) in Season two (2) than she did in Season one (1), Vera is still not too ""huggable"" or cuddly; however, she remains a darn good detective.  What tenacity she has, forever ""digging"" for the truth.  There are indeed many hidden truths in Season two (2) for her to dig up and dig them up she does.  This season is so well written, directed and wonderfully acted by all. Season two (2) has intriguing mysteries that had me spellbound in their entirety. I found myself, in Season two (2) , to be consistently surprised at the outcomes of each of the episodes.

8763841,1,B01GWCD1XM,"We ordered the complete set (seasons 1-5). Season 2 was completely blank (the others have been fine). So I ordered a second replacement copy - and it, too, was blank. Sent both back, and received credit for only one of the two copies. So it's a bit hard to ""review"" something that I've been unable to see!!!!! And no, I'm not happy about this.",1495756800,,343,4.375
