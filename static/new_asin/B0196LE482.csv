8744172,5,B0196LE482,"This is for the Lobster / Flicker Alley Blu Ray release.

Visually stunning film with lots of art deco architecture and sets that were clearly a huge influence on Metropolis. Tinting is preserved throughout and print quality is great. Subtitles for intertiles standout well enough with a slight yellowish color. There are two scores available to view film with, one by Aidje Tafial which has a modern electronic and at times dub step feel. I found this to be a little too distracting so I went with the Alloy Orchestra's score which was jazzier with a discordant sounding Moog synth.
As for the actual story, the first half is a pretty boring and dry vamp drama featuring Georgette Leblanc who just feels uninspired. The second half which does not last long enough in my opinion is an eclectic sci-fi Frankenstein segment predicting the flat screen TV and satellite dishes. One cannot wonder how great this movie could have been with a better leading lady.",1491177600,,956,4.829268292682927

8744174,5,B0196LE482,"Leave it to Flicker Alley to come up with a silent movie that I wasn't aware of. I may have come across Marcel L'Herbier's 1924 L'INHUMAINE (The Inhuman Woman) in some silent film reference book but I don't recall it. I knew of the director's later movie L'ARGENT (1928) but not this one. Having just watched the film, this is rather surprising as it is quite remarkable on a number of levels. Some of the futuristic design especially in the laboratory scenes recall a Soviet sci-fi film called AELITA, QUEEN OF MARS which was released 6 months earlier while Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (1927) may have borrowed a thing or two from them later on. L'Herbier envisioned the film as being a ""miscellany of modern art"" and there is indeed something for everyone in an artistic sense. From an entertainment sense, it's a different matter as its appeal outside of artistic circles would be very limited (just like art films today).

The melodramatic plot tells the story of a callous opera singer (real life opera singer Georgette Leblanc who co-produced) who throws lavish parties and toys with men's affections. When one of them suddenly commits suicide, her fans and detractors clash at one of her concerts recalling THE RITE OF SPRING premiere in 1913. A jealous suitor poisons her with a deadly snake and then it's up to a former lover to bring her back to life in his state-of-the-art laboratory. That's just the basic outline. L'Herbier uses every cinematic trick he can think of from rapid montage editing to a saturation of color tints to enhance his story. The real star here is the decor, a riot of art nouveau as conceived by several leading artists of the day. The sets (especially the laboratory) and the fashions must be seen to be believed. As the plot would indicate, this is not meant to be realistic in any sense of the word which makes it ideal for the medium of silent movies.

The restoration by Flicker Alley and Lobster Films may be the finest that they have ever done regarding the overall look of a film. An original nitrate print in good condition (courtesy of the director's daughter) was the source material and the original color tints as specified by L'Herbier were utilized in the transfer to a digital medium. The two set pieces, the tumultuous concert and the lab resurrection, remain astonishing even to this day. If you carefully look at the 57 minute mark, you'll see composers Erik Satie (ill with less than a year to live) and Les Six member Darius Milhaud (who wrote the original score which is now lost) in the audience at the concert. This Blu-Ray offering comes with two brand new scores, one by percussionist Aidje Tafial, the other by the Alloy Orchestra. Both are effective but I prefer the former. If ever a silent movie was made for Blu-Ray release, it's this one and Flicker Alley & Co have done it up proud. Thank You!",1466208000,6,2858,4.691235059760956

8744177,5,B0196LE482,"Flicker Alley brings out a classic. A new Blu-ray outlet that is truly a classic in itself. One of the finest jobs ever done in my viewpoint in allowing this brilliant piece of cinema to reflect to a new generation of film lovers, in a flawless new restoration.

This is a 1924 French Silent Classic, also known as The Inhuman Woman. Its a one of kind film that stands out even today. I dare say Masterpiece for its ultimate beauty and story. Its a visual experience that leads the one watching into a tightly directed visionary reality, that is one of kind. This is a mix of drama with science fiction. This film is filled with experimental film techniques that is both eye opening and way before its time.

This is directed by Marcel LHerbier. He was a French film maker that was beyond his time in creating memorable pieces of cinema, that stand out, and still are truly remarkable achievements for the time period. Simply put, he was a masterpiece director that masterly envisioned stories to screen, that left lasting emotional marks on the watcher. He was a pure avant-garde brilliance of imaginative means that shine off screen. His work is some of the best out there. In his long career, under his belt he directed well over 50 productions. From Silent films, documentaries, TV Movies, feature films, shorts. He wrote, directed, produced, acted, edited, he was a pioneer of film making. One of the greatest visionarys in cinema. A soul that knew what he wanted to display. He envisioned mastery, and achieved that mastery through many of his works, and LInHumaine is one of those works.

Your main character is a singer named Claire Lescot. She is famous and many men court her. She loves the attention, plays off the attention, and also plays around and taunts them. Through this process one of the young men named Einar Norsen kills himself because of Lescot's toying, and coldness toward his affection. After his death she shows no emotion or care. Soon she finds people turning on her because of her coldness at the death of Norsen. One night she adventures to the grave of where Norsen is buried. There she lets down her guard and freely explains her love for him. How she always loved him. To her surprise Norsen is not dead. It was not true. Another man named Djorah is angry and has jealous of this new reality in that Lescots professed love, and now new relationship. And so he causes Lescot to be bitten by a snake, poisonous. She dies. But Norsen is a scientist and through his experimentation's he strives to bring Lescot back to life.

Your main lead of Lescot is played by the beautiful, multi-talented Georgette Leblanc. She was a true gift to the entertainment world. She was a French Opera Soprano, author and yes actress. She was a truly gifted entertainer that was a one of kind persona that left the world with many fine examples of perfection both through cinema, music, and writing. On an interesting note Georgette was friends with the director Marcel, and had approached him with the idea to make a film starring her.

Also starring the brilliant Jaque Catelain as Einor Norsen. Like Georgette, he too was friends with the director. Catelain was a major Silent Film actor. He went on to act in the talkies also, but his fame was during the silent era of film. Working in over 20 silent films. He was one of those performers that seemed to own the emotional roller coaster of facial expressions, body movements that displayed the proper reaction one needs to display the right effect in a silent film, in that the audience watching understood the emotional plight of the characters. He made you experience what was happening to that character on screen. He was a genius in my viewpoint and shinned in this film LInhumaine.

This drama mystery mixed with the elements of fantasy is a prime example of a classic film that stands the test of time, and should be watched, studied and expressed to all generations of film lovers. Thankfully Flicker Alley has honored this film on a truly one of kind, lovely new outlet. A solid perfected Blu-ray that is pure gold for any lover of cinema. A fine example of how to treat an older film. This is a whole new outlet expressed with a mastery, crafted with beauty, displayed, and given an expertise, and ultimate love affair for film.

Audio/Video:

Now what majorly needs to be talked about is the awesome flawless restoration that has gone into this film. Lobster Films along with Marie-Ange LHerbier, French CNC, SACEM, Maison Herm&egrave;s all contributed to bringing this old film into a new light of perfection. A 4K resolution. This film looks gorgeous. An utter treat to a film lover. Pure eye candy through imagery, pristine and clear.

Next one has to mention the audio music. Displayed flawlessly also. The music is in two different ways. The first being by Aidje Tafial and the second by the Alloy Orchestra. The crystal clear sound. Crisp. Solid perfection as one listens.  Both audio and video has never looked any better on this classic film.

Extras:

Behind the Scenes of LInhumaine: This is a great watch. Filled with great information on the film. Any movie buff will absolutely love this feature. Runs about 15 minutes. A great 15 minutes to educate yourself on this fine film.

About the Recording of Aidje Tafials Music: Really loved this program, specifically because I love music, film scores are one of my favorite realities to music. Music sometimes makes a movie, expresses a movie, and gives a movie a beating heart. In Silent films the music was the golden ticket. Silent Films had to have the soundtrack to make the film flow with an ease to demonstrate emotional reactions and ordeals happening. The music done for this feature is a moving, emotional, clarity that is demonstrated with a high class expertise.

You also get a booklet. This is a fantastic read and also filled with photographs of the feature film and the behind the scenes reality of the production. A perfect added bonus.

Overall:

Flicker Alley is one of the greatest companies honoring and bringing out flawless pieces of cinema. They pay great respect to film. They showcase the brilliance and importance of protecting and giving new outlets to amazing cinema pieces forgotten by time. Their presentations are by far some of the greatest examples of how to express, and treat the art form of motion picture. LInhumaine is a prime example of that beauty. This blu-ray is a must own experience. Any movie lover, movie buff, movie historian, guru of film, should have this in their collection. It should be displayed with love, care. A flawless blu-ray. Highly Recommended.",1457481600,11,6776,4.797598627787307
