8279922,4,B001AWAWM8,"There's a number of martial artists that many fans wondered how'd they look on the screens of a Shaw Brothers film. Angela Mao, Billy Chong, Tan Tao Liang, Chia Ling & Chang Shen to name a few. Another name prior to 1982 that would is Hwang Jang Lee, one of the baddest villains to ever grace the stage of a kung fu flick. Well somehow they were able to secure him for this one & only appearance on the SB screen, Kid from Kwangtung. Long time actor & action director Hsu Hsia is the director & got him in the one here. The film revolves around 2 rival students (Wong Yu & Cheung Gam) who competes in just about everything from traditional Chinese dances to a challenge among hopping ghosts. Their teacher (Yen Shi Kwan) is secretly tied to the rebel forces looking to overthrow & defeat the evil magistrate (Hwang Jang Lee). Also part of the cause is a mother-daughter team (Huang Mei Mei & Yeung Pan Pan) that's on the run & looking for vengeance against the same magistrate.

I must say, for one who isn't thrilled with Wong Yu as a martial artist, he looks pretty good in this one. He displays a nice monkey style of kung fu. Cheung Gam normally is just known for being the so-called ""fatty"" in most of his films & not really proficient in kung fu, but he does ok here. My only issue though is that the 2 guys become experts basically in a manner of minutes. Yeung Pan Pan is good in this although I've seen her better in other films but she does fine here. Huang Mei Mei is just as fierce as the mom with a score to settle. Yen Shi Kwan though displays an awesome brand of monkey kung fu that he teaches to Wong Yu. He looks really great! Ku Kuan-Chung is also in this as a troublesome nuisance & has ties to the magistrate. Yuen Tak is here as well as Cheung Gam's brother. As for Hwang Jang Lee, rarely does he shortchange you with it comes to his styling of kung fu & here that's definitely not the case. He displays a killer cat style when he's revved up & of course his boot game is pretty much without peer!

But in the end, if you can survive the antics between Wong Yu & Cheung Gam then you will be treated to some pretty good fighting & an overall nice kung fu flick as well...",1485129600,,2191,4.18957345971564

8279924,5,B001AWAWM8,"Great kung-fu choreography and a decent story.  One scene included a great competition that was almost like a lion dance competition, but was between a chicken and a centipede.  Always enjoy those types of friendly fight competitions between two kung-fu schools.  Movie is in Cantonese with English subtitle, so remember to turn on the closed caption if you don't see it.

To enjoy this movie, you really have to understand some of the Chinese cultures such as the lion dance competitions and superstitious aspects about ghost/zombies.  Overall, the story is about two boys from two different kung-fu schools, one owned by a father, the other by an uncle.  The two schools enjoy competing with each other, but a new disruption comes to town when a federal general (bad guy) arrives with his soldiers in search of a rebel leader's wife and daughter who belong to an association of rebels (good guys).  In his search, the general kills who ever gets in his way.  So, plenty of fight scenes from that, especially when everyone is also looking to revenge against the general for killing their loved ones.  It turns out the teacher of the kids' regular school is from the rebel organization and has secretively been protecting the rebel leader's wife and daughter.  Eventually everyone finds each other and they fight and fight to the end.",1484179200,,1334,4.888888888888889
8279925,4,B001AWAWM8,"Kid From Kwangtung (1982) was one of only two Shaw Brothers films that Korean Tae Kwon Do master Hwang Jang-Lee (Mandarin: Huang Cheng-li) appeared in, both times as villains.  I feel this movie contains one of the best performances of his career, playing a master of the ""Northern Legs"" technique, seeking to wipe out a group of anti-Ching Dynasty rebels.

Jen Shih-kuan plays a school teacher who is also a rebel, a master of Monkey style and Qin-na (locking/grasping) hand, who takes in two of his school students, played by Wang Yu and Chiang Chin, after they lose relatives to the Northen kick master.

Kid From Kwangtung has some spectacular choreography.  Director Hsu Hsia knew how to direct good kung fu fight scenes.  This type of choreography is pretty much extinct nowadays.  Hwang Jang-Lee was considered by many as the best kicker in martial arts cinema, and he could jump extremely high and far without any wirework or trampolines.  He is a true TKD master and former member of South Korea's feared Tiger Division during the Vietnam War.  Jen Shih-kuan, normally cast as villains, here gets to play a good guy and helps to train the lead hero, Wang Yu.  Wang Yu plays his typical ""rascal"" role, accompanied by Chiang Chin and the beautiful Yang Pan-pan.

Wang Yu was sometimes unfairly criticized;  although he wasn't considered the greatest onscreen fighter, he was a very competent performer, and he almost always either starred or appeared in good movies.  In this one he is able to handle his fight scenes very well. He was comfortable onscreen and I always thought of him as technically better than a lot of people, though he often downplayed it with his boyish roles.  Although he was not a ""kid;"" when he made this movie, he was around 27 years old.

My criticisms of this film would be the over-long and over-done comedy scenes that take up much of the beginning and middle of the movie.  Kung fu comedy can be a very tricky thing to get right.  Too much comedy, too much mugging for the camera, and trying too hard to be funny in scenes that aren't can really bog down the pace of a movie.  It's when the comedic aspects take a back seat and are used sparingly that it works best, as in the excellent final battle. This unevenness causes me to give it 4 stars instead of five; the fights are too well-done to give anything less.

If you are a fan of old-school martial arts films, this movie is a definite should-have.",1321142400,4,2442,4.6395348837209305
8279926,4,B001AWAWM8,"I always wondered how Huang Cheng Li would perform in a Shaw Brothers film with SB leading the industry in filming,editing,sets costumes,and most of all fight choragrapy. Well I was answered and the result was great just his fighting alone is what makes this movie his kicking skill is the best the reason I didn,t rate this film 5 stars is because I would liked to have seen him fight with a SB actor that would have given him more of a challenge like, Ti Lung, Chen Kuan Ti or even David Chang I didn't like how he got beat in the end.",1276560000,,537,4.223300970873787
