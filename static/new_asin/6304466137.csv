7872048,2,6304466137,Well Packaged Item... I have wanted this for way too long. Unfortunately the copy is very poor with sound to match. I was hoping for a crisp razor sharp copy with the wonderful Morricone Score to boot. It did not happen. I guess I have to wait for a better rendition.,1523318400,,267,4.254901960784314

7872050,4,6304466137,"This is a surprisingly good film.  Quinn is a disreputable character, who shows up in a remote town in turmoil.  The local indians are raiding the town, afraid that with it authorities will impose their will on them.  The townspeople are left with nothing but the church and mountain foraging.  Quinn enters this imbroglio, at first mistaken for a priest, and later as a leader attempting to mediate.  There is a compelling indian chief that also wants peace, but Quinn's overtures fail, much at the responsibility of angry indians, including a bitter metis, Bronson.  Violence ensues.

The realism is stark and moving.  It is a pity this is not more widely available.

Warmly recommended.",1306800000,4,689,4.973684210526316
7872051,5,6304466137,This is more of a complaint than a review.  The two other reviews are not even talking about this movie.  It is definitely NOT a comedy. Keanu Reeves and Jane Fonda are NOT in it.  I own and reviewed this movie and they are so NOT the same movie.  Maybe they need to check their titles.,1233878400,5,286,4.053571428571429

7872054,5,6304466137,"This movie has it all!. Action, Adventure, Suspense, Drama etc. Good Acting. Charles Bronson, Anthony Quinn in their best. Do not forget the part played by Silvia Pinal a beautiful Mexican actress. I can not understand why a clasic movie like this has not been advertized in the way it deserve. It would be wonderfull to be able to see this movie on widescreen and digital to enjoy the music and its quality. I got a VHS copy of this movie and I never get tire to watch it over and over again.",1145059200,4,493,4.311827956989247
7872055,5,6304466137,"Action packed with superb acting by Anthony Quinn and Charles Bronson.  Based on the book ""A Wall For San Sebastian""  It does stray from the original story.  Whereas the original Leon Alastray (Quinn) was a former Spanish soldier from San Luis (St. Louis in the Louisiana Purchase) and becomes a priest, the character in the movie is a deserter and bandit who masquerades as a Franciscan Friar to replace one who befriended him and was killed by a bandit half breed.  He manages to bring together a small village of Mexican people as a rough and tough priest.  Then defeats the Yaquis and a band of bandits (led by Bronson as Teklo) at the end and wins a girl.  While the movie ends with plenty of action, the book is more peaceful at the finis.  I wish MGM would put this on disc in wide screen before my old VHS tape wears out.  I watch at least once a month.",1135641600,5,861,4.3375
