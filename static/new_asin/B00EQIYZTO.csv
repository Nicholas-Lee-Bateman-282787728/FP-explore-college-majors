5934641,4,B00EQIYZTO,I enjoyed watching all these older musicals.  They took me back to a time in my life when things seemed simpler and if life was hard we didn't know it because everyone seemed to be going thru the same situations as you were.  Music has always been a big part of my life but unless it is a Disney movie most people probably wouldn't pay to see it at the theater anymore.,1530316800,3,369,4.111111111111111

5934706,4,B00EQIYZTO,"2-22-2018  Excellent movies! Enjoyed all except Viva Las Vegas simply because it was Typical 'stock' Elvis movie. Plot is always the same with very little deviation from all of his other. However the others were exceptional and I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys musicals. There has been some remarks about Yankee Doodle Dandy NOT being in color. Believe me, the B & W is a much better version. Any of the colorized versions  are fairly inadequate when it comes to replicating colors; or in this case grossly exaggerating them. On the negative note the disks are stacked on top of each other. I would stack each disk individually or at least with some type of separation (even paper would do the trick)  rather than on top of each other. This manner is a ""Scratch"" waiting to happen.",1519257600,,792,4.683453237410072

5934754,5,B00EQIYZTO,"Awesome classic movie collection, packaged well and shipped fast! I love these old movies. Such a wonderful selection of top rated classics. Singing in the Rain Has been rated as the greatest musical of all time. Many of us grew up with the Wizard of Oz playing on television once a year. Everyone would be talking about it days before. ""Hey are you going to be watching the Wizard of Oz""? Those who didn't have a TV would find someplace to go where they could watch it with others. It was the greatest anticipated event for every child every fall season. And then to add one of Elvis' most loved movies ""Viva Las Vegas"" with Ann Margaret. What a charm. Then there's ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" and ""Carosel lThis is a collection I will cherish for years to come.",1489881600,,769,4.5

5934761,5,B00EQIYZTO,I bought this collection because I had never seen Singing in the Rain and it was cheaper to purchase this collection than it would have been to buy the movie by itself.
