8064895,5,B0009POICC,"I can't believe after reading the reviews they're for the same DVD my wife and I watched. The DVD very clearly illustrates the Breath of Tantric Love meditation.
This is a beautiful meditation that will connect you to your partner in a deep and spiritual way that we have found very rewarding. We first did this meditation in a workshop that included most of the material in the DVD and wanted to include it in our lives but couldn't recall all the different sections.
Steve and Lokita own the Ecstatic Living Institute which offers a variety of workshops to enhance the lives of lovers that are looking to expand the possibilities of their relationship.",1415577600,,654,4.745614035087719

8064898,4,B0009POICC,"This dvd is 60 min long string Steve & Lokita Carter (couple on dvd cover). The production is simple but good. Lighting is muted for mood but can still see on the main area & it's bright for the intro.
There is a 15 min intro on what breathing can help with opening up your heart & connecting with your significant other for deeper, longer releases. If you are open enough, you will be able to release w/o getting undressed or direct physical stimulation to the obvious areas. They also touch on the chakras, but only a little.
The main part is the guided step-by-step breathing for 35 min. There is no music & the woman narrates throughout. It starts with 10 min of learning to give compliments to each other, voicing what negative issues you wish to get rid of, positive you want to add & discussing what boundaries you have at that time. You set up an area to sit facing each other & start with playful fighting to get rid of nervous energy & stress from the day. The rest is breathing, starting with just increasing your own by focusing on each chakra, then by sharing the breath, when one breathes out, the other breathes in. Added is pelvic tilting, breathing into your pelvic area, then the woman sitting in the man's lap faces touching to breathe all the way in the tantric yub yum position.
There is no nudity involved or foreplay much less more. This is to learn to connect & increase your energy, most people know how to do the physical part or there is a whole video industry on it.
A great add is they put in a 7 min overview of the exercises with word titles so you can skim through that after doing the full step by step for a refresher. Though this is mostly about breathing, being told to relax, be free to laugh, move your hands, seeing it done & sensing it working for them for real so you can sense when it works is great. Just telling people to breathe deeply is not enough in books. I would suggest music while doing this to keep you from getting distracted by daily annoying worries.
The bonus area is a 3 preview of a dvd for partner tantric yoga poses, tantric massage. There is also a 3 min overview of their workshops & 7 min on how people felt about a tantric workshop vacation in Costa Rica.

BTW, when you or your lover are very shy/scared & unsure of yourself when in bed or even outside of bed, this is exactly how you should NOT feel with your lover. You should overall be very confident/relaxed & you WILL feel the energy. THAT is tantra. If you have to keep checking, asking, worrying about what your lover thinks... that will kill any connection. You should go with your instincts which is what reads what your lover wants. To learn that, that is what this dvd is for.

The ""Playboy - Tantric Lovemaking"" is also a good dvd to learn how to bridge the spiritual of this dvd with some of the advanced physical techniques.
Do not get ""Loving Sex - Modern Tantra Workshop"" since she barely goes over any spiritual or physical tantric knowledge & only emphasizes on toys, candles, erotic artwork, etc. which is the exact opposite of what tantra is.

You can see a preview of this at their site ecstaticliving com though it's only of them breathing with a VERY zoomed in lens that is not on the dvd that might make people uncomfortable since you can sense the true sexual energy that you don't from any R rated movie or some other adult videos.",1177027200,17,3374,4.37799043062201
