8671950,5,B00MFPUIGO,"SACRIFICE AT PEARL HARBOR  is a British produced documentary, largely based on John Toland's research for his book ""Infamy,"" and Toland is created.

The information presented makes a very convincing case that FDR must have known an attack was imminent, and Pearl Harbor was one of a very few possible targets. The facts are that he knew a massive Japanese fleet was in the north Pacific heading west. However, he did nothing to alert his commanders in Hawaii. If fact a summation of the evidence gives the definite impression the president was deliberately hiding this information from the Hawaiian commanders. Cryptographic machines readily intercepting Japan's diplomatic codes, but this too was denied naval and army commanders at Pearl. Australian and Dutch military in the Far East picked up signals which strongly suggested Pearl was about to be hit. They told Washington but the warnings were not relayed to Pearl. Again and again redundant red-flags foretold of the imminent threat, but Washington resisted every effort to sound the alarm. Why? American citizens were adamantly opposed to the US entering the war, and FDR needed something really big and horrible to turn public opinion around. The horrible attack did that for him. Now we can also access the horrors of FDR.",1518048000,,1282,5.1291866028708135
