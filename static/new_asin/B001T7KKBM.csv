8340740,4,B001T7KKBM,"A good third of THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT occurs at Christmas time. Because it's set in NYC, we see the tree in Rockefeller Center and other festive Manhattan decorations. There's a holiday party at the home of a well-to-do couple (they have a lush white tree with green ornaments) while at a single mom's flat the family's humble tree sits off in a corner of the living room.

The film stars Peter Sellers, but his is a peripheral character. Also in the cast are Paula Prentiss (small role in first half-hour), Tom Bosley, Angela Lansbury and Phyllis Thaxter. The leads in this story are really two unknown 14-year-olds: Tippy Walker as 'Val' and Merrie Spaeth as 'Gil.'

Val looks like the youngest Brady girl with her blonde pigtails while Gil is more sophisticated. She has a genius IQ and plays beautiful piano. Gil becomes infatuated with a mediocre concert pianist (Sellers) and the two girls follow him all over Manhattan. The story's more complex than that, for it's really about these kids' friendship and Gil's troubled family life.

Henry Orient is an odd character-- he doesn't like to practice and it shows in his performances. After a Christmas night concert at Carnegie Hall, several members of the audience hang by the stage door so they can jeer and boo him, like they would a ballplayer who muffed a catch. Henry's a playboy and a paranoid coward-- and those are a couple of his better traits!

This quirky George Roy Hill picture is a thoughtful family story that deals with holiday depression, divorce and especially the concerns of adolescent girls.
