7926362,2,B00004XPOG,"Perhaps the producer(s) of this film had the intention
of preaching christianity with this film. The film started with a kiss
and then ended with a kiss in a church premises between
two un-married adults,could this be the way of Jesus, the
son of Mary, the Messenger of God?
To the film proper, it's about having two fatal accidents,
becoming seriously handicapped and still aiming for a dream,
about how to prepare to achieve it....",1287964800,,433,4.786666666666667

With the heartwarming encouragement of the physical therapist masterfully played by James Earl Jones, he sets out to bicycle across America.  Paired with Jones in this uplifting tale of tragedy and triumph is Matt Geriak, an Olympic parathelete, also from California.  In a classic case of life imitating art, Geriak lost his leg to cancer and went to complete his doctorate in pharmacology, while making his Hollywood debut.  Seeing this young athlete reprise the story of his character in the film while knowing how hard won was his method acting makes watching Dream Rider all the more inspiring.",981417600,3,719,4.966666666666667
7926365,5,B00004XPOG,"James Earl Jones delivers a masterful performance in this film based on a true story. Jones, by administering ""tough love"", helps a young athlete recover his will to live after suffering a debilitating injury. Unlike so many movies of this genre, Dream Rider does not suffer from cloying sentimentality. Rather, it is an inspiring story which realistically depicts what it takes to recover from the emotional and physical distress of a serious setback. This is a ""must see"" for anyone who has encountered a serious injury or any family member or friend of such a person.",980640000,5,570,4.947916666666667
