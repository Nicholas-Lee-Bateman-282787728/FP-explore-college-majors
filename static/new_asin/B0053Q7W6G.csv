4549190,5,B0053Q7W6G,"Triangle is an excellent documentary about the Triangle Fire. Of course we all know about Triangle, but this film brings all those young women to life. Terrifically elegant. So well done, especially the interviews with their living relatives. This documentary would also be an exceptional supplement for any class studying this time period in American history.",1337126400,10,360,5.446428571428571
4549191,5,B0053Q7W6G,"Triangle: Remembering the Fire is simply the best film available about the Triangle Fire. Speaking as an historian -- and also as one who's alive because of the laws passed after the Fire -- I cannot recommend this film highly enough. Blowback Productions/HBO Documentaries gives us a slice of history, living history. I held my breath as I watched the descendants of some of those lost in the Fire speak; I felt the victims reach out across time and tell their stories. I saw their faces come alive in those of their descendants. And I found myself thinking *if only she'd survived; what kind of world would she have created?* (I even felt a modicum of compassion for the owners Blanck and Harris, too, when I listened to Blanck's granddaughter tell her story.) If history is meant to open our eyes and give us connection to the past, then this is how it should be done. If Triangle: Remembering the Fire was also made as a *portent* of what's to become of labor today, it succeeds there as well.

Triangle: Remembering the Fire was made in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Fire. On March 25th, 2011, bells rang the world over in the form of cell phones, fire bells, and church bells, as the victims' names were read in New York City. I hope people watch Triangle: Remembering the Fire and *think.* I hope they *think* about what's happening now with deregulation of industry and the loss of collective bargaining. I hope that they see what these victims *gave* us as workers: strength in numbers and workplace safety. And I hope they see what could be lost in an instant of greed.

As I wrote above, I'm alive because of the regulations that came down after the fire. Back in my Spent Youth, I was in a factory fire. Now, my Daddy told me the story of the Triangle Strikes and Fire. He told me to always be aware of the exits -- all ways out. And one morning, a fire came down. My team was evacuated in a flash, because I paid attention during fire drills and was aware of all exit doors. If Daddy had lived to see Triangle: Remembering the Fire, he would've said: ""Kayla, those Good People didn't die in vain. They made our lives safer."" And I've thought many times since that fire of how worthy of remembrance the Triangle Fire is; and I've thought, too, of those innocents whose lives were sacrificed so that I could live through a 1980's factory fire. When I think about it like that, their loss is *personal.*

Triangle: Remembering the Fire belongs in every library, every school, and every historian's personal collection of DVDs. It's *that* important and it's *that* good!",1308700800,30,2588,4.561290322580645

8455597,5,B0053Q7W6G,"Everyone who insists the USA doesn't need a minimum wage, labor unions or worker safety standards should be required to watch this documentary.  The women who lost their lives in this horrific disaster died because of this erroneous belief, greed and an overall lack of concern for the working class aka the poorest Americans.  This documentary is all the more relevant today than it was a hundred years ago.  The faces of these innocent workers, many of them not of adult age, speak to us from their graves to continue their cause and to speak in their names for generations of workers to come.  A heartrending documentary.",1487808000,,624,4.803738317757009

8455605,5,B0053Q7W6G,"I saw this documentary on HBO and promptly ordered a copy for my personal library off Amazon.com. It is a documentary no one should miss. I had never heard of the Triangle fire that killed so many women, men and yes children in New York 1911. Many of those who died jumped to their death forshadowing another tragedy in New York 110 years later on 9/11. I have since read several books on this event and find the events leading up to this tragedy and the way this event, among others, changed our labor laws. Immigrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, Ireland and Italy, came to America for a better life. They were met with discrimination & working conditions the likes we can't immagine. The Ladies Garment Union became stronger because of events like the Triangle fire and eventually led to the adoption of child labor laws, safer working enviroments and better wages.",1351382400,6,868,4.717105263157895
