8494217,4,B000C22MXE,"An allright compilation video....has a lot of the usual clips, but then some rather obscure clips of young Hardys facing Razor Ramon, 123 Kid and Volkoff. Also deeply explores the Hardys being the New Brood, in retrospect a rather obscure moment in the attitude era. It also has the Blockbuster exclusive aspect going for it, adding to obscurity and collectibility. Appealing to both wrestling fans and video collectors, or both. Bottom line though, simply the most amazing part of this oddity would be that Peter Thomas the narrator of Forensic Files, is the narrator of this video. To regular viewers of Files the voice is unmistakable. I searched IMDB and this seems to be uncredited, but there is no denying that Petey T is walking us through attitude era history, one table at a time.",1416009600,,789,4.851851851851852
