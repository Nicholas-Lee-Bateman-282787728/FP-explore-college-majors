8675984,5,B00N37Q8CQ,"We need more Christ-centered, creative young people who have an understanding of emerging technologies/cryptocurrencies/current events who can connect the dots like Gonz Shimura does in his videos. If all Christians would make an effort to relate Biblical endtimes prophesies to the world we see around us, we would probably be more motivated to reach the lost. The world is changing so fast, I regularly watch Shimura's FaceLikeTheSun channel to explore new technologies or international machinations from a Christian perspective. If you haven't watched the first ""Age of Deceit"" movie, definitely do that first:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Age-of-Deceit-Fallen-Angels-and-the-New-World-Order/dp/B006T5JZ4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Age of Deceit: Fallen Angels and the New World Order</a>&nbsp;I'm hoping he will review the BBC documentary called HyperNormalisation, because it is so informative, from a secular perspective, about the current Age of Deceit in which we live.",1509148800,,1024,6.706766917293233

8675987,5,B00N37Q8CQ,"I watched this for free on several channels, but I decided to purchase it because I want to help the producer to continue to do this kind of work.

I think that we are living in a very ""unusual age"" that does require study to understand.  While most are burying their heads in the sand, things are happening.

I would recommend this to anyone that has a mind and questions everything that is happening and don't just accept anything the ""system"" feeds us.",1478736000,,455,4.457831325301205
