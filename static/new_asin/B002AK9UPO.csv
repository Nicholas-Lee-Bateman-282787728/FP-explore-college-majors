3884501,3,B002AK9UPO,"Season 2 of Eli Stone really changed the game around.  The partners may have lost their original bid to wrestle the law firm away from Jordan Wethersby (Victor Garber), but a changed conscience gives them another chance.  And it isn't long before Eli Stone (Jonny Lee Miller) and Jordan are heading a law firm devoted to helping the underprivileged with legitimate cases.  Unfortunately, the poor can't always pay for the services that are being provided.  Most surprising of all is that Maggie Decker (Julie Gonzalo) left the firm to join the other side.  Now, she and Eli often square off in court.

Meanwhile, Eli's aneurysm is back, giving him more visions that may or may not make his life easier.  And he's got his father's diary to guide him; unless it makes things even more complicated.

Cases this season involve a family fighting over how to bury a fallen soldier, the wrongful termination of a news anchor, and an atheist who needs a heart transplant.  Where does it all lead?

Thanks to sagging ratings, this set represents the final 13 episodes of the show.  Every episode features multiple stories and there are several intriguing plot lines that would have kept me going as long as the show had aired.  Yes, there was a decided soap opera feel to things, but those lines kept me going.  I just loved the characters and the way the actors brought them to life so much, I had to know how they would turn out.

Unfortunately, the liberal agenda of the show continued at times.  Not every week was bad, but when they decided to get political, they really preached.  Those episodes became predictable, too.  You always knew who was going to lose.  Okay, so it was usually fairly obvious who we should be rooting for each week anyway, but this only made it more obvious.

Honestly, if they hadn't ended the show with a baseless attack on Christians, I might have given this season one more star.  But the parents in the heart transplant episode really got to me.  I don't know anyone who would have behaved the way they did.  If I hadn't wanted to know how it all ended, I would have turned it off in disgust.

So, basically, if you enjoyed the first season, this season really is more of the same.  And if you aren't familiar with the show, see how cheaply you can watch it before you invest a lot of time doing so.",1250553600,6,2326,4.549397590361446
3884502,5,B002AK9UPO,"A very wise fictional little girl named Lisa Simpson once said ""You will never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator.""  The short life of ELI STONE is living proof of this, with ABC filling its network with WIPEOUT and the like.  I don't think many people knew how to take ELI STONE.  Was it a law drama? Was it comedy? Was it philosophy? Was it a musical?  The answer is all of the above and more.  ELI is ahead of it time, and in a genre by itself.  It was well written, well produced, well acted and intelligent. It was a perfect show for the new millennium, with selfishness and perceived goodness rampant in our society, watching Eli realize there is something greater out there, and his, and the people around him transform and grow was truly moving.  Congrads to the ELI STONE cast, writers, and crew for amazing work.  I'll miss ELI, and I would have loved to see where the story would have gone if it continued.  I'm glad ABC released the last partial season to DVD, as I hope it will continue inspire and entertain.",1250380800,29,1039,4.426315789473684
3884503,5,B002AK9UPO,"I watched every episode of Eli Stone when it was broadcast, and I can't wait to get my hands on the DVD of the second season, to add to my first season package.  The only good thing about the way TV studios operate nowadays (canceling great shows like this without a second thought) is the greedy ******** are quick to capitlize on the DVD market, so they will provide us with something to see for years to come.  Oh well...",1250035200,,424,4.2875
3884504,5,B002AK9UPO,"Between the opening music (That last note is an emotional killer) and the closing credits was one of the quirkiest, warmest and twistiest storylines ever conceived for the screen, Big or Small. The whole was not only greater than the sum of its parts, but was presented weekly in a way that made each character shine briefly, yet brightly. ""I can't wait 'til they get back to what's going on at/with..."" [fill in the blank].
Jonny Lee Miller has a way with this comedy/drama (and full length movie drama)that proves his status as remarkable actor. He is Everyman to everyone in the audience: We would all like to say the things he says, feel the wonderful things he is able to feel and touch people in the real and meaningful way that he does.
The supporting cast are all wonderful, believable and make one truly feel for the characters they portray.
ABC must think that a new idea is a bad idea from the number of great shows it has discarded in favor of Nickelodean rip-offs and mindless humor.
Shame on you for throwing away this gem!",1249171200,4,1037,4.550802139037433
3884505,5,B002AK9UPO,"Eli Stone was one of the few television shows out there that was worth watching. It was well written, well cast, and well put-together. I loved all of the characters and the story lines. It actually has a moral and heart, which is multitudes more than be said for all of the crap ABC is replacing this show with (Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, Bachelorette, etc). ABC really dropped the ball when then dropped this fantastic show.",1248220800,5,429,4.512820512820513
3884506,5,B002AK9UPO,"Okay, we have wonderful actors that not only can act but sing...A story line that keeps you guessing, and action and charitors that keep you intrested...And what does ABC do with this show?  Does it give it a chance?  Nope, Eli Stone went with the way of Pushing Daisies and Life on Mars.  At least now I have this wonderful show on DVD and will now ignore anything else ABC puts out; like ""Help I'm a Celeberity get me Out of Here""...Good God.",1246320000,36,444,4.325301204819277
3884507,5,B002AK9UPO,"Eli Stone has touched the hearts of many fans worldwide, especially here in Australia. Season 1 had revolved around a range of George Michael songs and some very deep soul-searching for Eli.  And Season 2 continued just that, without the George Michael but with more twists and visions that hit Eli very close to home.

The excellent acting by Jonny Lee Miller and the whole cast makes the show feel that much more unique, especially with the sometimes hilarious quotes by Loretta Devine, the wise and very talented Victor Garber, the cheeky character of Sam Jaeger and the beautiful women Natasha Henstridge and Julie Gonzalo, and also not forgetting James Saito as the sort-of Chinese acupuncturist.

Season 2 is the final outing of Eli Stone, and many viewers will have many questions unanswered. However, we do know that Elis visions in Season 1 answer some of those questions [check through them and you'll see what I mean!]. It is a pity that ABC couldn't punt one more breath in for Eli Stone but the DVD has been long awaited.

If you liked Eli Stone Season 1, dig into your pockets for Season 2, and you will not regret it. If you got into Season 2, I recommend taking a step back and discovering the whole story. And if you're reading this without having watched a second of it, try an episode. It will leave you feeling like you gotta have faith.",1244246400,46,1357,4.618257261410788

3884611,5,B002AK9UPO,"It's been nearly six years ""Eli Stone"" last saw the light of day, but I STILL haven't forgiven ABC for yanking this wonderfully affable comedy-drama-fantasy. I still wonder where its creators were headed when the plug was pulled: What society-changing case were Eli and Wethesrsby going to argue in front of the Supreme Court? And why was Eli's ultra-liberal ladylove standing opposite him as counselor for the One-Percenters? Would Eli's chronically perilous medical condition lay him low once again, or was it truly a gift from God? And would we see more of Sigourney Weaver as God Herself? Alas, we'll never know.

""Eli Stone"" was a smart, snazzy, wholly beguiling show, blending loopy flights of fancy with a serious reality and a gutsy social-political stance. It was a show sporting characters one cared deeply for no matter how surreal their predicaments -- a minor miracle in itself.

Bottom Line: What would our world have become had Eli, an unlikely yet engaging messiah, been allowed to go about his work? Alas, we'll never know the answer to that, either. Call it Redemption Interrupted.",1426291200,,1099,5.032967032967033

Johny Lee Miller (of Sherlock) is fun to watch and the ""vision"" sequences are generally full of music and dance, always a plus.  George Michael fans will be happy to know his music factors in considerably during the first season and he even makes a couple of appearances. My only real complaint is that season 2 ended not with a bang, but a whimper. It seemed as thought the makers didn't find out in time that the show was being cancelled and thus weren't able to draw the show to a bigger, more satisfying conclusion.

The character and relationship developments in this season are both good and bad.  Good because you really to get to know each of the characters and like them...and bad because the second season is also the final season and there was so much more material to be covered here so you're left hanging.

It went the way of other amazing shows: Everwood, Kings, American Dreams...I even found Lipstick Jungle, regardless of its rather ridiculous name, a high-brow version of the cartoon-like Sex in the City.  L.J. was a guilty pleasure, but a quality show in terms of character development. Still, Eli Stone had it all. It reminded me of a more philosophically-probing and adult version of Ally McBeal. Perhaps, it was too thought-provoking for the ""reality"" show generation. After all, how dare a show challenge us to think and consider the meaning of our existence while it entertains us? Preposterous! I avoid TV, too much garbage, but I do buy these DVD collections. The bonus? No mind-numbing commercials!",1294963200,2,840,4.957446808510638

Since this is probably one of my favorite series ever, I had to get Season 2. I had missed one or two episodes of Season 2.

Both orders arrived quickly and it was such a treat to watch this wonderful show once more. Jonny Lee Miller has to be the only actor able to bring this character to life. I loved the whole cast of the show, especially Victor Garber. I enjoyed watching all the episodes in order and know I will watch them again in the future. I was really angry when the show was cancelled, but sadly more than one brilliant show gets cancelled now and again by a money driven network.

3884850,5,B002AK9UPO,"Eli Stone is a wonderful show and I was so sorry to learn that it only had two seasons, but both seasons are definitely worth purchasing and watching, as well as passing along to friends and family. We watched both seasons in two weeks, a couple episodes every night. This show is full of interesting character developments, engaging musical scenes, and most of all, hope that anyone can change and often will when role models exist.

Thirteen years ago we cut off our cable and went off live television because so little existed that offered a way for us to view the world with hope and direction. This show renews one's sense that the universe is ordered and that we all can change and grow into better people. The character of Eli has a personal transformation that helps so many others to follow suit.

It's too bad that a show demonstrating the cathartic power of ""doing the right thing"" was not embraced quickly enough to have staying power in our world of instant gratification and search for quick profits. This show is well worth purchasing, viewing, and giving to others as a gift. I cried at the end of the last episode, realizing that the season and the show were over. Where would we go now (in an entertainment sense) to be  encouraged to embrace our integrity, re-establish our honor, and continue to develop our faith in a positively evolving universe?

Well done, those who helped bring this show to the world. You have helped to change lives and should be very proud of your uplifting work. I only wish others of vision would have embraced this show before it ceased production and would have brought it to us for many years to come.",1278633600,5,1651,4.605442176870748
3884851,5,B002AK9UPO,"I discovered the series just before it was canceled.  I was delighted to be able to finally see it.  It seems that so many good programs are cancelled, but the stupid ones remain.  No wonder Netflix and amazon do such a good business!",1278374400,,234,4.395348837209302
3884852,4,B002AK9UPO,"Not very often does a show hit the airwaves with this much hope. A man Eli Stone is given a gift. He sees visions that are given to him by a higher being. He uses these visions to help his clients who have been some way or another mistreated. Through his visions the audience can't help but be uplifted by this shows positive message that there is good in the world and hope for a better tomorrow. This isn't your typical sex and deceit legal drama. There is romance but it is not the hookup in the back room soap operas that most shows have fallen into.

You really care about these people. They are all crusaders for what is decent in this world. Don't get me wrong they are not all saints, they are human beings after all, but the overall message to the series is that we should all fight for the greater good and cast aside the greed in our lives for the betterment of everyone. Also for those wondering if the show had a satisfying conclusion. It did with a well wrapped up story as the final credits roll. For those of you who need a little inspiration out of your television this series will surely put some hope in your heart.",1276300800,,1134,4.25
3884853,5,B002AK9UPO,"I really loved this show.  It was quirky and very entertaining.  It is hard to understand the reasoning behind the decisions to cancel or not.  Currently ABC has only 1 show I watch (Castle) and another I might possibly like (Happy Town)  I does seem like they could have more than 1 good hour of TV out of 168 hours a week.  I do occasionally watch several of the kids shows on Saturday morning TV, but Damn, it does seem like when they have such a wonderful show as Eli Stone they could let it run as least until they have something better (or even halfway decent) to replace it with.

Enough.  On the bright side, I at least have this set of DVD's to remind me of better times on ABC.",1273363200,,687,4.159090909090909

3884855,4,B002AK9UPO,"In the second season of Eli Stone, conflicts among the characters emerge, distracting from 1st season focus on Eli's visions.  The courtroom and entertaining delusions take a second seat to numerous sub-plots concerning family and friends.  All of the characters play larger roles, often times leaving Eli as just one of the people with problems.  All in all, the 2nd season is heavier and more dramatic than the naive and quirky 1st season, but different doesn't make it worse.  One could even argue that exposing flawed, complex characters add depth to the show.  (I kind of preferred the archetypes of the 1st season's supporting cast.)  Just be prepared for the emotional ""cliffhangers"" requiring you to watch the next episode (or next several episodes) for closure.  But don't get me wrong; there is plenty of ""quirk"" left in this show.  It was still one of the best shows on TV, and I will miss it dearly.",1267747200,2,911,4.832258064516129

3884867,5,B002AK9UPO,"We loved this show from the start and were so disappointed when it was cancelled.  It's always terrible when a great show such as this one gets cancelled.  Too bad someone hasn't brought this show back to give it another chance. It's about an atorney that gets his next case from visions, which interupt his life until he helps the people they are about.  The law firm he works for starts believing in him and changes the way they do business for the better.  It's very well done and always interesting.",1265500800,,503,4.4945054945054945

We don't watch television at our house.  I picked up the first season at Blockbuster and we were hooked.  So sad that there were only two seasons.  We watch the shows over and over again.  The episodes move from poignant to laugh out loud funny.  If there were more shows like Eli Stone on television, we might consider turning the tube back on. . .",1261699200,,519,4.626373626373627
3884869,5,B002AK9UPO,"Worth getting. Second season as good as the first and continues to unfold more about Eli's background and it's relevance to his 'current life'. I felt the ending was rushed in a effort to tie things together.  Was VERY DISAPOINTED America decided against continueing on the series - hence the rushed finish.  I thought it had more to tell and unfold.  Some objections to the series seemed to have arisen from immunisation/autism episode.  I have an autistic nephew and I didn't take it seriously.  People need to get a life!  To follow this line of thinking would mean that doctors actually break into (or even have time to break into) peoples homes in an effort to cure them (House), destructive robots could teleport through time and kill you (Terminator 1,2 & 3), and I could actually travel from planet to planet by going through an arch (Stargate).  Come on people, where's your imagination?  We need more 'light hearted' programs like Eli Stone.

This 2nd season is fun to watch, but it's bittersweet to realize that I'll never be able to see what was in store for those thoroughly enjoyable (and talented)characters.  Even so, the last episode ended on a good note; with questions unanswered, to be sure, but with a confirmation that most things were going in the right direction, at least.

On one hand we were losing the ability to see these characters grow.  On the other hand, with the end coming, you knew we were going to see rapid character development and the wrap up of the relationship back/forth, we saw in season 1.  Its nice, now having both seasons sitting on top of the Blu-ray player.  I so enjoyed watching the previews for the following weeks episode.  Now I have both seasons to watch whenever I want.

My only disappointment came in the brevity of the second season due to the station's lack of insight to keep it going. I believe the third and subsequent seasons would have been a great success. The story plot was a step in the right direction for television viewing. The whole of life (including the spiritual order) was offered as an invitation and not as a necessity for everyone. It was not religious in the traditional sense, however, it did offer religion in the delicate sense of being human and not automatons.

3884891,2,B002AK9UPO,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the first season and eagerly awaited the second season.  I will give some foreshadowing of the rest of this review, in a manner as subtle as the sledge hammer touch of a second season writer, by saying that by the end of the second season, we were both saying ""good riddance.""  After the first few episodes of the second season the show lost its direction.  In the absence of a plot, they resorted to demagogy.  The first season had leaned to the left, which was annoying but tolerable.  In the second season, it became intolerable.  I'm certain the confused writers thought they were pushing the boundaries of social consciousness, but its all been done before, and screaming ""BIGOT"" at the audience isn't insightful or thought provoking.  Simultaneously, in order to cram down the small plot that remained, the characters were forced to become erratic.  Each of the main characters became, in turn, nasty, and mean spirited.  Even their dialogue became disjointed, as if essential elements of the conversation had been left on the cutting room floor and no one cared to pick up the missing pieces.  By the end of the series we didn't care who died in the plane crash - preferably all of them. Apparently the writers, directors and editing staff all stopped caring about this show long before their intended audience.

Victor Garber and Natasha Henstridge also turn in fine performances as Eli's colleagues and as a father and daughter.  Loretta Devine is hilarious and feisty as Eli's put-upon assistant.
 This show dares to deal with the spiritual and divine, but without ever getting maudlin or preachy, and the musical numbers that are part of Eli's ongoing vision quest are usually fun to watch.

With its commercials featuring George Michael singing ""Faith"" and dancing lawyers, needless to say, the series caught the attention of many people and was a big hit.

The series is created by Greg Berlanti (""Brothers & Sisters"", ""Dirty Sexy Money"", ""Everwood"" and ""Dawson's Creek"") and Marc Guggenheim (""Brothers & Sisters"", ""CSI: Miami"" and ""Law & Order"").  The show features music composed by Blake Neely (""The Mentalist"", ""Brothers & Sisters"" and ""Notes from the Underbelly"") and cinematography by Michael D. O'Shea (""Bones"", ""Jack & Bobby"" and ""CSI: Miami"") and Dennis Hall (""Big Shots"", ""The Cleaner"" and ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"").

The series revolves around an attorney named Eli Stone (Jonny Lee Miller, ""Smith"", ""Aeon Flux""and ""The Flying Scotsman"").  In the first season, Eli Stone was experiencing dreams which he doesn't quite understand but it appears those visions have a way of foretelling the future and has given him the ability to use these visions to help people.  Of course, no one believes him but because his father had a similar situation and died of a brain aneurysm, Eli gets checked and he it is discovered that he has an inoperable brain aneurysm that is causing his hallucinations.

Eli's personal life is even more confusing because due to his law career and his visions, it has led to a breakup with Taylor Weathersby (Natasha Henstridge, ""She Spies"", ""Commander in Chief"", ""Species""), the daughter of his boss at the law firm, Jordan (Victor Garber, ""Alias"", ""Milk"", ""Justice"").  Before Jordan would run his law firm as a firm that took on big cases for the money but he and the law firm begin to become inspired by Eli.  Eli was your typical corporate lawyer but since he started having these visions, he has become dedicated to helping people on pro bono cases which has put him at odds with the firm's owners and some of his other attorneys.

Because Eli has these visions, he has grown closer to people that he works with such as his receptionist Patti Dellacroix (Loretta Devine, ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""The PJ's"" and ""Dreamgirls"") and also the rookie attorney Maggie Dekker (Julie Gonzalo, ""Veronica Mars"") who he eventually has an off-an-on relationship with.  Other characters that work for the firm are Keith Bennett (Jason Winston George, ""What About Brian"" and ""Eve"") and Matt Dowd (Sam Jaeger, ""Lucky Number Slevin"", ""Girls Club"").

But for Eli, his personal confidants that he goes to in regards to his visions is his brother and surgeon Nathan (Matt Letscher, ""Brothers & Sisters"", ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" and ""Joey"") and his father's friend Dr. Frank Chen (James Saito) who works in alternative medicine and helps Eli continue his visions through acupuncture and other means.

In the first season, the series focused on Eli's visions and how he is able to help people but also ended with Eli having surgery for his aneurysm.

For the second and final season of the series, with Eli now having his aneurysm removed and now doing OK.  His brother Nate may have developed the aneurysm and now having the visions.  Because his brother has much more to live for, helping people's careers as a surgeon and the on most likely to have a family, Eli makes a deal with God to transfer the aneurysm back to him and thus, the series focuses on Eli now having to continue in helping people and the people close to him but also knowing that this time around, learn more about his father and how he did and knowing that he may not live a full life due to the aneurysm.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""eli stone - The Complete Second Series"" is featured in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1:78:1, enhanced for 169 television.  For the most part, the picture quality of ""eli stone"" is good as expect from a drama series on DVD.  But one of the positives of the series is that there is quite a bit of outdoor shots and many musical scenes.  Needless to say, the series had a pretty strong budget and production quality and cinematography was quite solid.  Low light scenes don't have high noise as some dramas on DVD have suffered from.  But for the most part, picture quality for ""eli stone"" is solid.

As for the audio, the series is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is primarily a dialogue driven series with front and center channels being the main source of audio distribution. Dialogue is clear and understandable.  There are scenes during Eli's visions that utilize surround sound but these are few.  If anything, its the music of ""eli stone"" that comes alive. Music plays a big part of the drama series and sounds great.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

""eli stone - The Complete Second Season"" includes the following special features:

  * Circular File: Bloopers from Season Two - (2:06) The cast of Eli Stone trips, slips, *bleeps* and falls through some of Season 2's funniest impromptu moments.

""eli stone"" was one of the more entertaining, humorous, spiritual and also inspiring drama series I have seen on network television for awhile.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It's really a shame that the series really never caught on with many viewers.  Sometimes I criticized the series time slot for its cancellation.  With other newer series getting the time slot after ""LOST"", ""eli stone"" seemed as if it was floating around on different days and times and after it was announced that the show was going to be canceled (along with several other abc shows), catching the second half of the series proved to be difficult.  So, needless to say, unless you watched it on abc.com, personally I've been waiting for the series to come out on DVD.

The first season was highly enjoyable and it was not known if the series would come back for a second season.  So, I was content by how the series ended.  But when the commercials started coming out and promoting the second season, I was excited.  Eli Stone with his style of helping people through his law firm and his visions, awkward as he maybe, its what makes him successful.  Each character was fun to watch, as each has their own personal quirk about them but for the second season, we started to see more character development with all the supportive characters that were built around Eli Stone.

Also, with season 2, the series seemed to take on the suffering of people through the state of a weak economy and thus, a storyline that is affecting the hurt on law firms (which I hear quite frequently through friends who are lawyers), it was quite intriguing to see it become part of this series.

As for the DVD release, I wish that there was a significant send-off via its special features.  Possibly a commentary audio track, more special features on the other talent, just a little more that would give fans who were supportive of the series a sort of closure of feeling wronged by the series cancellation.

But I really enjoyed both seasons of ""eli stone"".  The series was absolutely enjoyable, fun, well-written, well-acted and just entertaining.  Some may feel a bit put off by its spirituality (ie. possibly Eli's receiving messages courtesy of God) and thus this series was not for them but the series was unlike other drama series based on attorneys or law firms.  This was about people willing to help people, people inspired by Eli Stone and things that didn't seem possible, was made possible.  A show that was based on ""faith"" and even ""hope"".

But for all what is said and done, ""eli stone"" finishes with a solid season and for fans of the drama series, I highly recommend ""eli stone - The Complete Second and Final Season"".",1251244800,5,10874,4.655987394957983

8359613,5,B002AK9UPO,"I loved this when it was on TV and was pleased to see I could enjoy it again.  You cant miss with Jonnie Lee Miller, one of my most favorite British actors, who does a stellar job playing an American lawyer.  I just wish their pilot wasn't a case about vaccines causing autism which scientists have completely disproven.  Still, it's fiction, and hopefully people can remember.  Hollywood does an exceptionally lousy job when it attempts to produce polemics about the issue du jour, as they are so often very embarrassing and factually flat out wrong.  Stick with fiction, folks.  Especially with science and politics, etc.!  Miller's protege becomes increasingly annoying and I think was a problem that the producers should have dealt with as the series got into its second season.  Still, I really liked watching it, and it was probably one of the last shows I regularly watched on a broadcast network as i then turned almost completely to cable networks like USA, and subscriptions like Netflix, etc.",1489017600,2,1003,4.893491124260355
