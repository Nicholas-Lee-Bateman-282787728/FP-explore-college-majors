1742674,4,B00006CXTK,"but why did they film the class with that stupid post in the way?!?
the DVD really makes you feel like you are in an ashtanga class.  I wouldn't suggest it for someone who has never taken ashtanga before because the positions are not explained.",1042934400,6,244,4.4222222222222225
1742675,4,B00006CXTK,"I have been practicing yoga for only a few months.  I am definitely a beginner.  I enjoy doing this DVD, because for me it is extremely challenging.  However, if you don't have much experience, you may feel a bit inadequate.  The students seem to know which poses to do before the instructor even says them.  I, on the other hand, had to look at the tv often to see what exactly they were doing, and that made it difficult to keep up.  Plus, at 75 minutes, it may be a bit long for someone who is not already well conditioned.
If you definitely want to be challenged, and won't mind watching a room full of people doing things to a much higher level than you can do, then purchase this DVD.
Beryl is a wonderful teacher, and I'm sure that if you have the patience to keep doing the practice, you will do things you never thought were possible with your body.",1042675200,17,858,4.265432098765432
1742676,4,B00006CXTK,"I liked the video.  The instruction was really good and fairly easy to follow.  I found watching the practitioners inspiring.  It definitely gave me a good workout.  It was challenging; a little too challenging.  It was a long session.  For me it was too long but I'm a beginner.  I can see someone who has been doing yoga some time enjoying the hour and fifteen minutes of yoga.

My only real criticism is that the DVD is not broken up into scenes.  While I was going through the class, my DVD player froze for whatever reason.  The only way I could get back to where I left off was to start from the beginning and fast forward.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this video to someone who is at an intermediate or advanced level and wants a challenging, well-guided session.  When I'm at that level, I'll most likely use it then.",1042329600,,831,4.466666666666667
1742677,3,B00006CXTK,"This is a very advance yoga workout. I found it helpful because I was looking for some additionally challenging yoga postures, well I found it. In reality, it's a little over the top unless your a very dedicated and practice yoga on a daily basis. I do asanas daily (power style) so it is appropriate for me, but most people I know do not practice daily and if they do this video they are likely to hurt themselves. So if you are not doing regular ashtanga style or power style yoga on a regular basis, don't get this, it will be to difficult for you. If however, you practice power/or ashtanga yoga regularly, here is the next step to challenge yourself. (Dont' expect to perform all the postures at first)",1039910400,12,707,4.446153846153846
1742678,5,B00006CXTK,I highly recommend this DVD. Beryl and this Astanga class are motivating and inspirational. I have studied yoga off and on over the years and cannot get to a class very often. Having this tape has helped me get back into a practice. I really like the fact that Beryl is not some supermodel or actress. It is clear that she is an expert and really understands the body.,1038268800,4,368,4.3478260869565215
1742679,5,B00006CXTK,"This is a great video to really build body strength.  It helped me tone up, slim down and feel great.  Beryl Bender Birch is a great teacher and I look forward to her future videos.",1038009600,,181,4.142857142857143
1742680,5,B00006CXTK,"I've had the pleasure of having practiced with Beryl in NYC for the past four years and having this video has enabled me to bring her special brand wisdom and expertise right into my living room for those days when actually practicing in person is impossible.  For anyone who hasn't been lucky enough to see Beryl in action, this workout is a must.
Beryl breathes this practice (no pun intended:)  And because it is so much a part of her, so integral to who she is, you feel like you are in the hands of a true expert.  Her presentation is calm and clear and you truly get the feeling that wherever you are in your practice, in general or that day, it's ok.
The fact that there are many levels represented on the video makes it easy to feel comfortable, no matter what level you are or how you're feeling at the moment.  Even after practicing for years, it's helped me to push to the next level being able to watch those on the video that are more advanced than I am, which is great.
Bottom line, I can't recommend Power Yoga The Workout enough.  It's a rare opportunity to practice with a rare yogini.  Don't miss it.",1037923200,18,1118,4.3253588516746415
1742681,5,B00006CXTK,"Most yoga books and tapes provide some degree of technical help.  This is the first yoga instruction video that I have wanted to use daily.  I feel like I am learning, progressing and benefitting in mind and body.",1037836800,8,213,4.578947368421052
1742682,5,B00006CXTK,If have found Beryl's newest video to be an inspiration to my practice!  The video is a great way to take a yoga class HOME!  It is really easy to follow and offers great modifications for all the poses.  I am looking forward to seeing more of Beryl Bender Birch in upcoming videos!,1035417600,3,282,4.283018867924528
1742733,1,B00006CXTK,"This yoga video is a fabulous example of how a possibly decent yoga class makes for a drudging and possibly injury-provoking video.  If the instructor were watching her students she would realize that not everybody can move at the same pace, but because her ""students"" are the people watching the video at home, she has no idea if they are keeping up with her or not.  Yes, I know she's actually teaching a class on the DVD, but even some of them have trouble keeping up with the routine and she doesn't seem to slow down.

And about that: every other yoga video I've watched and done is taught by someone who is doing the routine while they tell you about it.  She is merely walking around her class talking (and unnecessarily touching some of the more attractive members under the premise of ""helping"" them with their poses) while they do the hard work.  Could it be that maybe the routine is too hard for her?  It would have been much more effective without the class there and if she had just done it all herself.

The sun salute section went on entirely too long, it was quite annoying to do downward dog after every pose, and not good for the wrists to move in and out of it so quickly.  I much prefer Rodney Yee's videos and instruction.",1171756800,4,1244,4.401746724890829
1742734,5,B00006CXTK,"I am not big on declaring fitness DVDs the best, but I must concede that this Power Yoga by Beryl Bender Birch is indeed the best.  Now Power Yoga is a derivative of Ashtanga yoga, a very athletic style yoga practice and Berryl's version of Power Yoga is as close to the eight limb tradition of Ashtange Yoga primary series with some variation.

Users should defintely be familiar with Ashantga/Power Yoga prior to practicing this DVD through use of Birch's ""Power Yoga"" book or at least be a fast learner and athlete.  There are a number of students varying in size, age, gender, and flexibility.  The asanas are perfectly guided by Beryl who constantly reminds the users to stay mindful by using the breathe and engaging the locks.

I have other Ashtanga/Power Yoga DVDs but none compare to this.  Its a life long practice.

Enjoy!",1170201600,4,833,4.703448275862069
1742735,2,B00006CXTK,"After using great teachers like Baron Baptiste and Total Yoga with Tracy Rich and Ganga White, this tape is in the bottom of my DVD pile, While the flow series is good, the middle of the tape is way to hard for most people and there is no instructions like with Baptiste, I spent more time trying to see what they were doing on the workout.  With all my other DVD tapes I can follow the workout without having to look over at the screen.",1152748800,4,437,4.141176470588236
1742736,5,B00006CXTK,"Let me start out by saying that this is not a video for absolute beginners.  Having said that, this is, overall a great video.  My only issue with the video is that when Ms. Birch says that there are alternative poses for those (like me) that are not quite flexible enough to do some of the bound poses she usually doesn't expound on what they are.  Although there is more than one person doing the video and they are of different levels ability, sometimes the camera doesn't show the easier variations.  That is my only criticism of this video.  Other than that, this is a fantastic dvd.  It is also one heck of a workout, and is also great for building your stamina.  This video is nonstop ashtanga from the get go all the way up to corpse pose.  Be ready to do plank to upward facing dog to downward facing dog between every pose.  This may not sound like much until you've done it for about an hour and ten minutes.  This video is also great to shoot for to improve yourself at yoga overall by going into poses that are usually not seen on other videos (i.e. a lot of the bound poses).  This is by far the most challenging yoga dvd that I personally own.",1148256000,6,1158,4.26605504587156
1742737,5,B00006CXTK,"I have seen the expertly performed Ashtanga primary series videos of Richard Freeman and Doug Swenson. The modified ashtanga videos of Baron Baptiste (I like the music also)and White Lotus Total Yoga - Fire are good. The beautiful videos of Shiva Rea and Ali McGraw are inspiring, especially on days you feel lazy. Some of my yoga teachers have been Bob Smith and Marie Svoboda (his teacher) and Robin Rothenberg until she moved to Fall City and Issaquah to open the Yoga Barn. I have had other yoga teachers and have many videos over the years. I knew I could not do the Ashtanga Primary series but this video shows how to modify and make progress. Very good!",1134950400,2,660,4.601694915254237
1742738,4,B00006CXTK,"Yes, it is the ashtanga primary series in its entirety. No, there is not a lot of instruction.

If you want instruction on yoga poses, look elsewhere, like Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti. She gives very good instruction, especially on the more difficult arm balancing and inversion poses.

If you want to do a real ashtanga primary series, then this is the DVD for you.",1132272000,10,362,4.640625
1742739,4,B00006CXTK,"I've got three months of yoga under my belt and I couldn't do half the moves. Maybe a year from now I'll be able to give this a try again. Three things prospective buyers should know. First, Beverly Woods uses the original language of yoga to instruct and you may get lost. Second, she goes very quickly, going through the sun salutations twice as quickly as Bryan Kest on his Power Yoga DVD. Third, there are a lot of advanced moves that she does not describe or give you detailed instruction. She assumes you know the moves from her book or that you are advanced and already have a familiarity with them. If you're a beginner or transitioning to intermediate, you may find this DVD discouraging and frustrating. Wait until you're advanced. At my level I've had more success with the power yoga of Bryan Kest and Rodney Yee.",1129420800,9,825,4.543624161073826
1742740,5,B00006CXTK,"Thank you, Beryl, for a complete Ashtanga Primary series.  I only wish you hadn't called it Power Yoga.  If you have been doing the Primary Series in class and want someone to walk you through it at home, this is the DVD for you (although David Swenson's is equally as good.)  If you are new to yoga, or want an easier workout, this is not for you.  Ashtanga is the mother of vinyasa yoga, and the Primary series is a set series and does not change.  I have loved this DVD, but I was already very familiar with the Primary Series.  I do not think it's a good idea at all to try this DVD without having been walked through the poses by an experienced teacher.",1116720000,5,658,4.182539682539683
1742741,1,B00006CXTK,"I do not recommend this DVD.  I consider myself pretty experienced and I enjoy more challenging workouts (Brian Kest, Eion Finn).  This workout goes too far though.  She moves so quickly between poses that I find myself becoming stressed out trying to keep up!  That is certainly not what I want from my yoga practice.  I found it really ironic that several times during the workout she actually preaches ""Don't rush"".  Ha, that is exactly what she is doing, and unless you rush, you can't keep up with her.  There are no backbends such as camel or bow so at the end of the workout you feel unbalanced because your hamstrings are really streched but your front side is still tight.  I've tried doing this workout many times just thinking that I needed to improve my attitude or try harder but I've finally given up.  I don't think I will ever enjoy this and I doubt many others will either.",1099526400,6,890,4.5125
1742742,5,B00006CXTK,"I am a 41 year old yoga teacher, and I been studying and practicing yoga about 8 years, and doing Bikram-style and power yoga for about three years. My prefernce is a very challenging practice that makes me sweat and try asanas I am not familiar with.  This DVD is not for everybody, but I loved it.  I also loved Beryl's book which I found at a used book store last winter (which you really MUST get UNLESS you have a great Ashtanga Primary Series class locally)  so although many of the reviews were negative, I decided to try the DVD.  I am so glad I did!  I learned so much just from doing it for a week! I find Beryl very  knowledgeable about all aspects of practice, her cuing is very nice but I can see how you could get lost if you are not familiar with the series.  I have to modify many of the postures that require lots of hip or shoulder flexibility, but... so what?  As Beryl's guru Patthabi Jois is often quoted, ""Do your practice, all is coming."" It sounds like many of the disgruntled reviewers were expecting to be able to just ""DO IT"" and were frustrated that they weren't ""told"" this practice takes TIME (1.5 - 2 hours), Patience, and ongoing practice to master. People -- this is yoga.  That's the deal. Yoga is a process of self-awareness.  If you just want to jump around and get in shape, The FIRM workouts are nice.  Baron Baptiste's power yoga videos are sort of ""Ashtanga Lite"" and may help prepare you for a more rigorous practice like this.  But I think Beryl is a great teacher, and her only mistake was not making a package out of her book and DVD, because they really have to be used together to get the most out of it.",1083888000,40,1650,4.270096463022508
1742743,1,B00006CXTK,"I am very frustrated with this purchase. NOWHERE on the cover does it even state that this video is not for beginners, and after reading the reviews by others on this website, it obviously is only for the very advanced. The back of the dvd box reads ""The students on-screen, ranging widely in age and ability, demonstrate modifications"" ...... LIES!!! To repeat... At least MENTION IT IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Now I am stuck with the purchase. Oh yea, the claim ""with detailed explanations"" is a JOKE. Just read the other reviews. Summary- purposely concealed the intended audience to increase sales to unsuspecting consumers. An HONEST description would have been the ETHICAL way to go about promotion of her product!",1082937600,7,715,4.966666666666667
1742744,5,B00006CXTK,"I loved this DVD.  The workout is by no means easy.  I think that if you either have good endurance or want to improve your endurance, then buy this DVD.  This DVD goes no stop for roughly 75 minutes.  This is the full primary series she is doing, plus a few poses she throws in.  The DVD has no bookmarks or stopping points, it's basically either you do the whole thing or you just fast forward past what you don't want to do.
I know some reviewers saw this this as a hindrance moreso than a help, but the idea is do all of the poses in a certain sequence.  The fact that there 8-10 people of different skill levels doing either the full pose or some modification makes up for lack of bookmarks/stopping points.  If you do want to just perform segments, then purchase Richard Freeman's Primary Series workout.  You can elect to do the whole workout (including opening and closing chants), or just perform segments (sun salutations, standing poses, seated poses, etc.).  However, there are no modifications, and Freeman is performing these poses at a near perfect level (check your ego at the door).  If you are looking for a shorter more accessible version of Ashtanga yoga, then try either Baron Baptiste's Power Yoga 3 or MTV's second power yoga tape.  While Baron offers a condensed (45 minute vs 75-90 minute) version that includes most of the easy to intermediate poses, the MTV version is a loosely based version of the primary series where many of the poses are there, but not necessarily in order, and the instructor uses a lot more creative license.
I found this DVD highly motivating.  Seeing people of different skill levels get through the entire workout spurred me to go on.  Berly makes the primary series fun and accessible, but you will sweat.  If you think that 75+ minutes is too long, then try one of the other tapes I suggested, however, if you want to try to complete the primary series, and want to build the endurance needed to do 1-1.5 hrs of yoga, then buy this tape.",1067904000,75,1993,4.561797752808989
1742745,1,B00006CXTK,"I was searching for advanced yoga tapes and for new challenging positions to advance my practice, read the mixed reviews for this tape and ordered it anyhow. It was as bad as the previous bad reviewers go, out $20 too. The tape was impossibly long, I think it was over the stated 75 minutes. The constant repetition back to up dog, down dog was monotonous and became irritating. No, she does not walk you through the poses, cursory camera glances are given to the people doing the modifications. I am through w/ this review, BUYER BEWARE on this one, save your 20 bucks.",1064016000,9,570,4.543689320388349
1742746,2,B00006CXTK,"I take live power yoga classes 2-3 times a week.  I've acheived wonderful results in 6 months of practice.  I wanted to bring the practice home and so purchased this based on these reviews.  Honestly, I'm surprised this has been rated so highly by many.  From the power yoga point of view, there isn't much power behind it.  She starts off with the basics: sun salutations A & B, followed by triangle, revolved triangle extended side angle, etc...(not necessarily in that order, but you get the picture)  There is a lengthy 15-20 minute segment right in the middle of the series that goes through 6 or 7 seated postures starting off with the staff pose. By this point, whatever heat you've built is completely gone and it feels a lot like a cool-down session. There is still another 20 minutes of poses after these seated postures.

I'm the kind of person who likes to break a sweat, and I've had live sessions where I've left the room completely soaked as if I had run 10 miles.  I barely broke a sweat with this DVD, it was a moderate workout at best and NOTHING like the high intensity that power yoga is supposed to be (well, for me at least).  I finally got smart and asked my yoga instructor what she follows for home practice and she recommended Baron Baptiste.  If only I had consulted her prior to purchasing this DVD! I was very disappointed overall and I would not recommend this if you're seeking a serious power yoga workout.",1058486400,37,1438,4.517374517374518
1742747,1,B00006CXTK,"I admit it -- I've only done this tape once. So please take my review with a grain of salt...
As an at-home exerciser, I've been doing yoga videos for years. All kinds, from Living Arts's mellow hatha yoga routines, to Bryan Kest's & Baron Baptiste's ""advanced"" power yoga workouts. Some I enjoy more than others but until now I had never encountered a yoga workout I did NOT like. This one, unfortunately, changed all that.
First, at 75 minutes in length it seems mercilessly long. However, I've done other yoga tapes that go on for a similar stretch of time, and did not feel the need to watch the counter on my VCR, as I did with this routine.
Maybe the problem is the constant repetition. After EVERY pose, you jump back to staff, down slow to a low push-up pose, pull thru to updog, push back to downward dog. I understand, this develops strength and gives this yoga it's ""power,"" but doing this series of moves after every single posture for 75 minute straight was maddening for me.
Other tapes, you do this for half the routine and then move to mat stretches and then a final cool down. With Birch's yoga workout, though, even the mat work is punctuated by these movements. The cool down, too -- she has you stretch out like we're getting ready to relax and then oh here we go, more power moves...
The only break we get is when she instructs the class to go to the wall to practice hand stands. Well, I don't have one bare wall in my house that I can kick my feet up against & not worry about slamming into furniture on my way down (or denting the drywall with my heels on the way up). There's also a headstand segment, but Birch doesn't provide any instruction. It's more like ""OK, class, time to do your headstands. Nice! Alright now come on down to staff....etc.""
I was a bit disappointed by the lack of explanation, because I was looking forward to learning some new poses thru this routine. Unfortunately, while I was eager to learn handstand & headstand, these postures were not TAUGHT, they were merely demonstrated. Sigh.
If you do a lot of power yoga and are really into the moves, you'll probably find my review pointless. However, if you're a home exerciser like me and were looking for a challenging workout to introduce you to some new moves & poses.... Sorry. I don't think this tape will deliver.",1058400000,8,2318,4.46933962264151

1742749,4,B00006CXTK,"This is a unique approach to Yoga, which intermediate to advanced students are likely to enjoy. Ms. Birch's tone of voice is calm and soothing.  The video provides a sense of maternal guidance throughout the workout.  The atmosphere is professional, taking place in a wood-floored dance studio, with realistic sounds (cars driving outside).  The setting provides attention to the smallest details (you can hear the participants breathing).
The workout itself is intense, starting with a 15 minute warm up and progressing to some wonderful twisting poses.  I've been doing Yoga daily for two years, and it took me a few weeks to do all the asanas.
The only complaint I have, which is quite problematic, is the design of the DVD itself.  There are no chapter markers throughout the workout.  I suppose Ms. Birch expects students to complete the practice in its entirety, but few of us have 90 minutes a day to practice yoga.  If you want to fast forward to, for example, twisting poses, you will have to hold down the fast forward button to reach the desired section.  I found this very annoying.  This is in direct contrast to intermediate tapes by Stephanie Foster (and others) who split their workouts into 20-30 minute segments.
While this DVD offers one of the comprehensive workouts available, I still find myself doing Gaiam's Total Yoga more often.",1051660800,12,1354,4.929515418502203
1742750,3,B00006CXTK,"I really wanted to like this DVD, but I was pretty disallusioned after making it through the practice.  I've been doing power yoga several times a week for over a year, and I'm in very good shape, but I found this to be too difficult and was not satisfied by doing the modified poses. I felt like if I couldn't do the full poses, I was not getting as good of a workout.  There were so many poses that I couldn't even come close to doing that I ended up wondering, ""Who can do this? And how long do you have to practice before you can do these kinds of poses?""  I guess I'll hold onto it and pull it back out in a few years - maybe then it won't  make me feel like such a newbie!  I do think the real problem with a lot of these yoga videos and DVDs is that there is no univeral rating system - it's almost impossible to tell before you buy one whether or not you're going to find it too easy or too difficult.",1045094400,15,909,3.9184782608695654

Both guys and girls love Bryan Kest, even beginners and friends who teach yoga as well.  Beryl Bender Birch's DVD is awesome as well.  The style is very similar to Bryan Kest, but she does sun salutations really fast (for warming up the body) and her asanas are really, really advanced.  No music, which I love because I can put on my own music.  Her voice and words are matter of fact, no trying to sooth you, which is fine when you are concentrating on your form.

I no longer primarily practice asthanga, preferring heated power yoga instead, but this is the best general introduction to that form and the basics of yoga philosophy.  I feel that Baron Baptiste's _Journey into Power_ is the best place for beginners because his sequence is more accessible, for nonyogis and westerners in general (let's face it, vrkasana is far more safe and accessible than ardha baddha padmottanasana) .

Beryl writes much better than Baron, however, and introduces much of the important history and philosophy, so I think this book would be an ideal second book to read.  Beryl is the best, I think, at explaining the mental side of yoga, the breath, and so forth.  The first chapter is filled with extremely valuable insight after insight on how the mind/body reacts, resists, focuses, and surrenders.  What she has to say here is eloquent, beautiful, profound, and true.

I find her instructions for the poses to be full of valuable information, but the book is somewhat awkward to use while practicing.  While Baron's book has nice color photos, different colored headings, to make it easy to follow, the layout editors or designers did not do nearly so well with this book.

For actually doing the practice Beryl describes (the primary series), I *highly* recommend that you also buy a copy of David Swenson's _Asthanga Yoga: The Practice Manual_.  It has great, clear, high quality photos, is spiral bound so that it lays flat next to your mat, has one pose per facing pages or so, and the essential instructions.  But, on its own, it won't do, because it has no introduction to speak of and the instructions are too minimal--one must refer back to Beryl.  The two books need each other.  Plus, Swenson covers the entire intermediate series, which Beryl just introduces.

After this, one should move on to Beyond Power Yoga, to go further down the rabbit hole of the topics raised in the introduction to this book.  But the photos in it are awful--they are all jagged and pixellated like jpeg thumbnails displayed full screen, so bad that you can't see the details of the poses, like hand position, etc.  If the design on the first book was mediocre, the design of the second is appalling.  I can't believe they sell it that way.  The person in charge should be fired and they should send replacement copies to all owners, along with an apology fruit basket.  Seriously.  Beryl's text in the second book is, however, great.  I also recommend her meditation CD.",1207440000,2,2750,4.781779661016949
7967297,5,B00006CXTK,"This is an Ashtanga Yoga DVD.  For those who are not familiar with Ashtanga (or Astanga) yoga, it includes lots of Sun Salutations.  If you don't want to do lots of Sun Salutations do not purchase this DVD or any other Ashtanga DVD.  I think this is an excellent DVD.  I attend live Ashtanga classes when I can, but love the convenience of yoga DVDs.  I own several other Ashtanga DVDs and love them all.  I love that she adds a few extra asanas to the routine that are not normally in the primary series (such as crane pose).  The class consists of students in a variety of shapes, sizes and abilities.  Therefore, modifications are shown.  This is a great DVD to add to your collection.",1203206400,2,688,4.396825396825397
7967298,5,B00006CXTK,"I have to take issue with Cafreen's review. I strongly suspect that the majority of people who buy this DVD will find the workout to be vigorous rather than moderate.  As noted by Jumpuphigh (see the 2 comments posted comments in reply to Cafreen's review) this workout is the Primary Series of the Ashtanga yoga practice. The order of poses in the Primary series never varies. The benefit, or power, in the workout arises out of the way the poses are sequenced (the specific logic of which is beyond the scope of this review). BB Berch did not create the 1.5 hour sequence, known in Sanskrit as ""yoga chikitsa"" or ""yoga therapy"".  It was developed in India by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, a renowned Sanskrit scholar and yogi. HIS mentor was Krishnamacharya, who, in the early 1900's, also taught Iyengar, and Desikarchar. All 3 students went on to popularize and to become the primary influences in the transmission of yoga to the West. Decades ago, back when BB Berch first coined the term ""power yoga"", other vinyasa (or flow) style practices that use the term to denote a vigorous, flowing yoga style did not yet exist to create the confusion that the term now often engenders.
Cafreen mentions the series of seated poses that occur mid-practice, but doesn't add that a vinyasa (consisting of a jump-back into Chattaranga Dandasana - the bottom or lowered portion of a push-up -  moving up into Downward Dog, from which you jump your legs between and through your hands, (ideally) landing on your bottom) is inserted between every half pose (i.e., a pose done to one side) in order to maintain the heat of the practice throughout the seated sequence. Moreover, in the Ashtanga system, holding the bandhas (or ""locks"" which in the Primary Series consist of mullah bandha [keeping the muscles that form the floor of the perineum lifted] and udyadha bandha [lifting and engaging of the lower abdominal muscles]) and maintaining a controlled form of breathing called ujayii during the entire sequence are important for ""keeping up the heat"". Although it is an intense workout, practiced yogis should not find it to be a cardiovascular workout.
The fact that Cafreen found it to be a moderate workout makes me suspect that she may be relatively new to yoga and may not have received any in-depth instruction on correct alignment. As an instructor, I've found that the majority of students who began in vinyasa-style traditions practice poses incorrectly, reinforcing habitual patterns of mis-alignment, which makes poses easier to perform, but ultimately causes us to miss out on one of the most powerful means by which yoga benefits practitioners. By the way, long before I was an instructor, I was one of those students who fell in love with yoga, having been introduced via a vigorous, flowing practice (the Primary Series of Ashtanga, not coincidentally). I then spent almost 2 endurance-building years in which I performed sloppy, ill-executed versions of postures that looked much like they looked the first times I'd tried them. When I first encountered an Iyengar-trained teacher (Iyengar yoga is extremely detail- and alignment-oriented school of practice) who focused on my form (or lack thereof), many of the poses in which I considered myself practiced, became quite a bit more difficult...and they have remained challenging, because there is no such thing as the perfected yoga pose. Ultimately, yoga is not about obtaining a cardiovascular high, but is about uniting movement and breath, balancing effort and surrender, learning to pay attention, to observe, and to stay present in the moment. BB Birch's book of the same name serves as a companion to the DVD workout and is an excellent source for learning more about the fundamentals therein - from what separates yoga from other forms of physical exercise to sequencing and alignment basics underlying the Ashtanga practice.",1199664000,8,3884,5.018604651162791
