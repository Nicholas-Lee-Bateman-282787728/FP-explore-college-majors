8276805,3,B001AD6UMI,"Long considered one of Edgar G. Ulmer's ""lost"" movies, GIRLS IN CHAINS (1943, Producers Releasing Corporation), stars pre-code and 1930s favourite Arline Judge (""Sensation Hunters"", ""The Lady is Willing"") as Helen Martin, the sister-in-law of notorious gangster Johnny Moon (Addison Randall). She's tried to devote herself to helping those less fortunate, but 'family connections' have often tarnished the pristine reputation she's worked hard for. When Helen is appointed as the new liaison officer at a girls' reformatory--another of Johnny's ""establishments""--she decides to take action, joining forces with undercover cop Frank Donovan (Roger Clark), in the hopes that Johnny's crooked empire will crumble.

Arline Judge (with a head of hair that looks strangely like a bread loaf!) offers a keenly-understated performance; one of her last major starring roles as it turned out. Toning down her usual screwball antics in favour of heartfelt drama, she's superb here. Judge is surrounded by a bright cast including Barbara Pepper, Robin Raymond, Dorothy Burgess, Emmett Lynn and Patricia Knox.",1241913600,,1096,5.682926829268292
