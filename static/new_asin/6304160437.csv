794725,5,6304160437,"I think I saw this film originally on the Hallmark Channel. It was such a charming movie and being set in 1950s Paris really lends to the charm. Nothing like the early post-WWII years in Paris! Lansbury is a great actress, so accomplished and versatile. I own the VHS tape but to desperately would love to ""trade"" it in for the DVD version. Why is so much junk out in DVD and gems like this are not? Beats me. Studio heads, please re-release this to DVD.",1162166400,10,454,4.290697674418604
794726,4,6304160437,"I saw this movie several times with my sisters. I especially enjoyed it because of the clothing fashion. The story line is rather thin, but good. It centers around a poor English lady who saves her money for a Dior dress. By the end of the story, she fullfills her dream (not without difficulty!) and also succeeds in bringing together a Dior model and her admirer.

This same little lady seems to have the same ""healing"" effect on nearly everybody else that she meets during her stay in Paris.

It is a lovely story, with great clothing! :) - However, for a guy it would probably be rather boring...",1137456000,7,600,4.495412844036697

794729,4,6304160437,"Though my generation (""X"") is pummeled with ""in your face"" action films these days, I was so enchanted to see the film, ""Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Paris"".  I thought it was a charming film  that I remembered long after I had seen it.  It is a sweet film wonderfully  simple yet very satisfying.  I wish there were more current films like it  about.  Mrs. 'Arris embodies the British spirit.  She works so hard to get  her dress even though she knows she will probably only wear it to her own  funeral.

Seriously, has anyone looked at that part? NO. I read the description, if it doesn't say it there, I don't see it in the specifics. I guess I have to look now. While, i'm SURE the movie is pure joy, I have no basis to say anything.

This was my fault, yes. I should have read every little detail. However, I do believe the seller should have accepted the return anyway. BE WARNED. You NEED to know this doesn't work on MOST DVD players in the USA. The seller will  NOT help you if you make the mistake.

I ended up selling it back to amazon, taking a significant cut in money and never getting to see the movie.

I originally recorded this movie on VHS as a child when it played on TV and never forgot it.  It is such a darling movie about an old lady who dreams of having her very own gown from the house of Dior.  As frivolous as the set up seems, it reminds me of the power of dreams, how important it is to be kind to people no matter how 'big' or 'little' they may seem to others, and also how fashion can really be a work of art.  I grew up in a small town in CA knowing very little about fashion, and now that I've ended up working in the industry in NYC, it makes me think even more fondly about how fashion can impact your life.",1439683200,,741,3.953020134228188

795500,5,6304160437,"I picked this film up nearly 10 years ago at a Salvation Army on VHS, purely on the fact that Angela Lansbury was in it. She has yet to disappoint me in any film I've seen of hers. The movie revolves around this lonely elderly British woman who has always wanted to go to Paris to buy a lovely Dior gown, but her husband, before his death, talked her out of such frivolous thoughts. Now, being on her own, with her only company being her neighbor who encourages her to do something she's always wanted. So secretly, she saves up for her trip and finally, much to her neighbor's amazement, is off to Paris to buy a Dior gown. Upon her arrival, she meets disappointment and ridicule at nearly every turn until a bright young Parisian risks her job to help the poor old woman fulfill her life-long dream.
I've been very sad to hear that there's only a UK release of this on dvd, as we all know the problems with VHS that have been...well-loved. One day, hopefully someone will listen to our cries of a Region 1 dvd for us here in the states and canada, so we can continue to pass down this beloved family film to our children and their children. It promotes great morals of dedication, perseverance, and the power of friendship that is seriously lacking in today's society. Definitely a keeper.",1325980800,,1291,4.451476793248945
795501,5,6304160437,"Mrs Harris, a widowed char lady sees a Dior dress at her job cleaning for a weathy lady, and it is so beautiful she determines to scrimp and save for however long it takes to earn the price. Her friends think this is daft as she gives up flicks and her drop of beer, and busses too, walking in the rain and cold to do her work. She flies to Paris, and discovers it is not so easy to buy a Dior dress. Her adventures are wonderfully heartwarming.  There's not a false note in this charmer.  You will watch it again and again. And it is not a bad movie for young kids, either, in this have  to have something now, never earn anything society.  Angela LAndsbury leads a wonderful cast including Omar Sharif. I actually purchased this on DVD at amazon.co.uk, because there was no region 1 version of this DVD (you would need a region free player if you go that route).  This needs an American dvd release.",1319241600,,901,4.276470588235294

795504,5,6304160437,"It is my opinion that ""Mrs. 'Arris goes to Paris"" is a movie that should've gotten a lot more attention that it had. From what I've read in the past, it was a movie that was nearly not made at all. Most of the major studios had turned down the idea of making this 1953 Paul Gallico novel into a movie, but Ms. Lansbury believed in the story so much that she put a considerable amount of her own money and influence behind getting it produced! Now that's what I call passion for the arts...too bad more in the Industry aren't doing that!

I can remember reading book when I was in my 20s, and I thought it was a very nice light read, so I was just thrilled to see the movie when it aired in 1992, and even happier when I was able to purchase the VHS a few years ago. Now I wish they'd put it on DVD so that others may enjoy this story, too. Sure some of it does seem somewhat dated as it is set in the early 1950s in France, but still I feel that the universal themes and values portrayed in this movie are still relevant...and I think that many of us can still identify with Mrs. 'Arris feelings. This is the perfect story of what can happen when one sets their mind to achieving a seemingly improbable goal, and then works hard to make that goal a reality despite setbacks and naysayers.

Angela Lansbury is a fine actress in the role of Mrs. 'Arris, and I especially enjoyed the role that Diana Rigg played as the vendeuse of the House of Dior. Omar Sharif was very charming in his role of the Marquis de Chassange, and I loved the mini-love story with the accountant and the model, played by Lothaire Bluteau and Tamara Gorski.

One caveat: if you purchase this movie be very careful because there are two versions of the same video: there is a shorter version (approx. 88 minutes) that is put out by an outfit called ""Family Values Video"" and it does a lot of censoring of the parts they consider not family friendly. Mind you, there is no sex, violence or profanity in the whole of the original movie, but the FVV people still found stuff to criticize and excise such as the part showing Mrs. 'Arris her friend Mrs. Butterfield in a pub filling out a football pool, and a part where Mrs. Arris shows a bit of cultural shock upon seeing a man exiting the public restroom in Paris zipping himself in public! Well, to me taking those parts out and other pretty much pretty much takes away the parts of the movie that makes it funny, and helps you to understand the charm of the story.

The uncut version is about 110 minutes...and is worth watching every second.",1308009600,2,2564,4.291322314049586
795505,5,6304160437,"Just received my movie 'Mrs. Arris Goes to Paris' and I absolutely loved it!

795508,5,6304160437,"In a day when so many movies focus violence or end of the world themes, it's quite refreshing to find a movie that evokes a different story (OK, yes it is an older movie but that is beside the point).  The movie Mrs. 'Arris goes to Paris is a enchanting movie with a  wonderful cast that delivers a fairy tale type story.  If you root for the underdog, love a good old fashioned movie with a love story attached and adore the fashion industry and Paris, this movie is for you.

As a side note, why it has not been released on DVD for region 1 (USA) is beyond me!  With the mounds of worthless movies being released on DVD every day, why not release one that people truly want?  That said, if you can get a VHS version do so, the story is worth it.",1284076800,,747,4.082191780821918

Too bad it is not on DVD but at least I can replace my homemade version with a pre-recorded video. Yes, the cockney accent is a bit different from the way she spoke on Murder, She Wrote, but charwomen were not portrayed as cultured. The story opens with Ada Harris (Angela Landsbury) seeing a Dior dress at one of her employers' homes and decides to do what it rakes to save up for one of her own. She walks instead of taking the bus, stops playing the numbers, or having a bit of gin and adding up her pennies. She finds a bracelet and is lucky to get the reward which gives her enough for her dress and off to Paris she goes. When she gers into the House of Dior by the back door, she is astonished to find she cannot just buy a dress, but has to attend a showing. Afterwards, the dress has to be made for her. Not able to afford lodging, she is taken in by the accountant, and when she offers to clean his flat, a lovely, young model actually helps her, and so begins a bit of matchmaking between the model and the accountant. At the showing is where Mrs. Harris meets a man who lets her call him Hippo, played by Omar Sharif, a big reason why I watched the movie, too. He has a sad tale in that he is unable to see his own granddaughter because he and his daughter are estranged from each other. When Mrs. Harris steps in and talks to his daughter, she lets her know her father waits outside the school yard every day to catch a glimpse of his granddaughter, and would she set aside her differences and let him see the child? As the fittings go on, behind the back of the director of the House of Dior who absoutely does not want ""that charwoman"" to wear a Dior dress, Madam Colbert, played so well by Diana Riggs of The Averngers fame, has her own troubles in that her late husband's actions in the war should have earned him a medal but France showed no sign of seeing that it was awarded posthumously, thus denying her the small stipend she would get, until Ada turns to Hippo for help. He also steps in to set the director straight on how to treat Ada by bringing in his friend Christian Dior himself. In the end, there is a final hurdle Hippo takes care of and Ada returns to Paris with her Dior dress and a tale her friend Vi Butterfield does not believe. A wonderful, if a bit on the Pollyanna side, movie, but in my opinion the only thing to fault this movie on is that it is not released on DVD. Other than that, it is a perfect 10.",1238371200,,2577,4.104950495049505
795582,4,6304160437,"I enjoyed the book so much I thought I'd get the film version.  Of course, few movies match the excellence of the written word, but this was a sweet story. Angela Lansbury is always a delight.",1234742400,2,192,4.333333333333333
795583,5,6304160437,"I watched this movie for the first time in 1999, after I accidentally picked it up from a public library. Even though I don't like to use superlatives as I inevitably end up changing my mind, this movie is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best movie I have ever seen. I still haven't changed my mind for the past 10 years!

It's just beautiful... like a postcard. It takes place between London and Paris in the 1950's, with all their charm. Part of the story takes place in the House of Dior in Paris where Mrs Harris (promounced 'Arris by her French friends) tries to purchase the dress of her dreams after she worked very hard to save every penny of its price. A tender love story unfolds as a subplot between a socially awkward accountant and a pretty model. Omar Sherif's role as a ""Ministre Sans Portfolio"" who is estranged from his only daughter is also charming. Mrs. 'Arris touches and changes the lives of all those she meets in Paris.

The only drawback is that the movie is too short... only 90 minutes!
I wish it was twice that long, or that there were a sequel.
