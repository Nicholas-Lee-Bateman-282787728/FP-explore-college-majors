8451090,5,B0050DOG7A,"This DVD accomplishes its purpose well.  It is meant to serve as a very general introductory information piece for those who may be unfamiliar with labyrinths and how they are currently being used around the globe.  I saw some of the reviews that rated it lower because they were looking for in-depth or specialized information, but anyone who sees the length of this resource (13-14 min.) should be able to figure out that this DVD is not an in-depth or concentrated resource.  I've used it as intended--a brief, general introduction--with a variety of groups, and it's been well-received by all.",1491177600,2,597,4.95

8451092,2,B0050DOG7A,"We were disappointed with the content of the DVD.  We expected to gain helpful information that we could apply to our walking labyrinth. It was not useful to us at all, even though the filming was lovely. It was a waste of money for us.  We would recommend ""The Sacred Path Companion: A Guide to Walking the Labyrinth"" instead.",1362873600,3,327,4.52542372881356
8451093,5,B0050DOG7A,"I showed this short DVD during a presentation on labyrinths for a local club. All the viewers felt it was very informative. This is NOT an ""in-depth"" examination of labyrinths, but does a good job of helping those who have not heard of them before.",1353628800,4,248,4.533333333333333
