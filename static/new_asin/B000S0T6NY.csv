But I consoled myself for sleeping on a Saturday morning to 9, with the plan to buy it. But it is out of print.  I guess Biography isn't in the business of Biographies, even when people want to throw money at them for ones produced years ago.

The biography is great, it's too bad we can't get it.",1348876800,,411,3.9878048780487805
8203654,5,B000S0T6NY,"This beautiful video tells the story of the popular singer and television

star Andy Williams. From his birth in 1927 through his singing career,

TV series ""The Andy Williams Show"", to his Moon River Theater in Branson,

the video shows rare and excellent photos and videos. Andy sang ""Battle Hymn of

the Republic"" at the funeral of Sen. Robert Kennedy in 1968. Highly recommended

for any Andy fan.",1319587200,,401,4.838235294117647
