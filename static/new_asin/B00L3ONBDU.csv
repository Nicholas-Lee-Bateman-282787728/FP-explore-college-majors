6464096,5,B00L3ONBDU,All three of these movies on Blu-Ray for less than $14 is a great deal. Pick this up if you can. The movies are on three seperate discs so the case isn't too great for storage but that's no complaint for me. Five stars for the product and the price.,1437091200,2,249,4.0
6464097,4,B00L3ONBDU,"The three films deserved five stars, but I gave four because the package,where there is not place for
the three films, only for two of them. When you open it, the Seven film dropped into your hands or the floor.",1433721600,2,211,4.3
6464098,2,B00L3ONBDU,"An imteresting package.
For packaging, if there are 3 discs, there should be 3 holders inside. This one has 2 holders only.",1430611200,,123,4.636363636363637

6464104,4,B00L3ONBDU,"A great threesome here but people should be aware that TDA is censored and there is literally no good reason for it to be. Some jackass sculptor got himself into a prissy fit with the cathedral where his work is on display; his sculpture being kind of copied into the film or something set him off. Rather than take the good press he sued them and now we have obvious swirls, which look terrible, over any scene with the sculptures in them. It does kind of ruin the picture imo and looks a bit dated but okay I guess.. Other wise the film is actually quite good.

I have Seven and Insomnia, which itself was in multiple Nolan boxes, and those two are great transfers well worth your money. For ten bucks the package is worth it, just be aware of TDA not being quite what it should be. It may never get a proper CGI redo of the sculpture either. Both Seven and Insomnia have high-bitrate transfers. TDA is a good transfer as well. Seven is a drop dead classic and Insomnia isn't too far behind.",1419552000,8,993,4.310160427807487

8663591,5,B00L3ONBDU,"I was looking to buy The Devils Advocate  (uncut) which cost close to 15$, already own insomnia but I didn't consider buying that movie again considering I only wanted the devil's advocate and I love the movie Seven so the 7$ I paid for all 3 was a steal. All these movies feature every extra that are on the Blu-Ray version's if bought separately. The picture quality amd sound are as good to be expected too. Very Highly recommended",1507680000,2,434,4.493670886075949
