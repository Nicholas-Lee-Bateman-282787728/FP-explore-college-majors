8062599,5,B0009KEWAU,"Like most movies with ""cult"" followings, LITTLE BIG HORN is these days only known by a relatively small number of fans.

This is the story of a cavalry patrol trying to warn Lt. Col. George Custer that Gen. Crook has been defeated by the Sioux (at the Battle of the Rosebud), and the same fate may await ""Yellowhair"" himself. Other patrols ordered back to the main body have been ambushed by hostiles and destroyed-- will the same happen to the one led by Capt. Donlin (Lloyd Bridges)?

With shadowy film noir-ish cinematography, a tight script and fine cast, this major western from a minor studio is one you won't soon forget!
