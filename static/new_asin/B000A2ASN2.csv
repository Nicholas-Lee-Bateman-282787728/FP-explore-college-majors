2350291,5,B000A2ASN2,"This has everything so you can really learn how to dance to a drum solo. Raquy will show you different rhythms, so you can get familiarized and learn them.  She does not go in a hurry, you will get plenty of demonstration.  Jenna is an excellent dancer and teacher.  She also explains in no hurry and offers plenty of demostrations.  The dvd offers coreography for all levels of dancers, so nobody feels left out.  Excellent to practice rhytms for drum, zills and dancing steps.  The whole dvd lenght is almost an hour and a half.  Great quality, highly recomended.",1124323200,13,565,4.646464646464646
2350292,4,B000A2ASN2,"Even though this DVD is yet to be released I have rated it with four stars because I believe that Jenna is a good drum soloist. From what I have seen on The Golden Apple, so I look forward to it's release  :-)",1121126400,7,209,3.86046511627907
2350293,5,B000A2ASN2,"This is a must have dvd to have if you enjoy belly dancing and/or doumbek drum.

It is a breakdown of must-know rhythms for dancers and drummers and
it's a great way to familiarize yourself with these for unchoregraphed performances.

Plus, I love the fact that it's women in both roles as dancer and drummer!",1344729600,,309,4.6
2350294,5,B000A2ASN2,"I love this DVD, and I love the time Raquy takes to break down the rhythms. Jenna is great and I can't fault this DVD, I use it all the time for inspiration.",1329523200,,157,3.787878787878788
2350295,4,B000A2ASN2,"This is the second DVD by Jenna I have purchased. I love her graceful dance style, original choreography and clear teaching method.  Beginners who want to advance their technique would find the practice and drum instructions useful.  The three dances taught range from beginner to intermediate with practice sections for each.  Probably a bit too basic for the advanced student but still nice to dance along with.  I am planning on owning everything in her range.",1326412800,,463,5.052631578947368
2350296,4,B000A2ASN2,"Okay, this is an awesome dvd.

It has a warm up section, rhythm work on knowing different kinds of beats and different moves to do to them. then there is a choreography section where you can see the performance, see it practiced, see the moves being broken down, and then learning the choreography.

there is a performance section where Jenna performs all 3 drum solos plus 6 minute bonus improv. Very nice.

My glitch:

On drum solo 3, she goes forward and backward in learning the choreography and there was this one move (you're turning in a 3/4 circle by moving your feet very tiny, and moving your hands from your back to your front, and she never breaks it down). It was soooooo frustrating and she never explains it, but I eventually learned it.

my 2end minor glitch, is that there isn't a button or a function to practice all 3 drum solos back to back. oh well.

I am still learning, months later, more about drums and beats and how to dance to them. It seems very simple but the complexities are vast for what you learn, if you just take the time.

oh and I forgot, the 2 shimmy drills. One is a 8-9 minute shimmy layering drill. Then there is a 3 minute 3/4 shimmy drill. Doing both will give you a nice sweat and some quad burn, lol.

Most definitely worth the price.",1322265600,,1279,4.34453781512605
2350297,5,B000A2ASN2,This is a very helpful dvd to learn simple to more complex choreography for the beginner to intermediate dancer. It is easy to follow. Very well done.,1314835200,,150,4.592592592592593

2350299,5,B000A2ASN2,This has been one of my favorites to re do and re do.  I have used 2 of the drum solos in short performances. I love the teaching method in front of a mirror where you can see front and back moves and the repetition of the choreography broken into parts.  KEEPER,1278460800,,262,4.019230769230769
2350300,5,B000A2ASN2,I got this dvd on the suggestion of my troupe leader and I have been dancing for 11 months. I attended a workshop and took a drum solo class and found that was the most fun for me. So I wanted to choreograph my own drum solo. This dvd helped describe the basics of drum solos such as music and teaches choreography. The choreography is broken down pretty well but I still found some things to be very challenging. It did help me in choreographing my own drum solo that I will be performing in a couple weeks! I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone interested in learning more about drum solos.,1258588800,,602,4.336283185840708
2350301,5,B000A2ASN2,This DVD is really useful.  The moves are great and the explanations are very good.  Highly recommended.,1245024000,,104,5.0588235294117645

2350303,5,B000A2ASN2,"While some reviewers have accurately noted that the actual video editing and production quality here is less than ideal...the actual content and information within make up for this ten fold!

The menus and play features are a bit annoying as they require you to select and start in order to play each section.  It would be better if the dvd simply played all the way through, without the stopping between each section.

Jenna offers  a warm up, figures and technique instruction, three really tight choreographies at beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels and just when you think it can't get any better, she throws in a wonderful and so well done section on drum rhythm identification, explanation, and examples.

This is one of the BEST productions regarding actual content and information I have ever seen! This DVD is generously filled with material to help you dance your best!",1242172800,3,888,5.01360544217687
2350304,5,B000A2ASN2,"I've gotten Jenna's other DVDs and loved how she broke things down for you, step by step. I've bought other DVDs (Neon etc.) and didn't like it, they worked too fast and didn't break it down enough for beginners.  Jenna takes her time with you and it's easy to follow her.  They show her feet, her hands, everything so you know what she's doing so you can then learn it yourself.  I would recommend Jenna as a teacher.  I have already bought this one and am just waiting for it.  :)",1242172800,,482,4.252747252747253

The thing this video has that I have never seen on a belly dance video is the rythyms explained - very interesting. I rented this and I will be buying it. I think this video is best for intermediate.,1240012800,,336,4.25
2350306,5,B000A2ASN2,"this is a great dvd. it is almost better than the original (Bellydance Basics and Beyond)!

2350307,5,B000A2ASN2,"this DVD is simply great,I love the way the menu is divided, so you have 3 performances of different level each, you can see the whole performance, the breakdown and learn and practice with music, very easy to follow. and also this dvd makes you understand what you are doing not just shaking and that's it, it combines the legs, the hips,the hand and the arms, so you can learn fluid movements and putting step togother in a choreography.

I LOVED the routines, the instruction, the performances, and the rhythm workshop. There is a LOT of info on this DVD, and its well worth the money. The routines are impressive and fun to do. I would give this one an A+++ and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have.",1228262400,,413,4.3076923076923075
2350309,5,B000A2ASN2,This was the first bellydance DVD I puchased three years ago as a beginner and I still use it as a reference today! This dvd has helped me advance faster than the other girls in my performance troups. I owe my killer 3/4 shimmy to jenna's clear concise teaching. I've recommended this dvd to many people but never lend it out because I won't let it out of my sight. I've recently started learning the zills and Raquy's break down of all the drumbeats slow at fist than faster help me practise. Zills aren't part of the DVD but demonstrates how you can grown with it!!!,1226793600,2,568,4.367924528301887
2350310,3,B000A2ASN2,"This DVD is cheap and I think the quality is corresponding to that. Generally, it's OK but when I compare it for example to IAMED DVDs (of more than double price, I know), the quality is not so excellent. The movements are not so well explained (at least for me), many things are repeated more times so finally no so much content. The quality of the video is not very good, especially the lighting, sometimes it really seems to me like made by amateurs. Anyway, Jenna seems to be really a good dancer, her choreographies are nice and really from beginners to advanced levels, so something for everybody. I was a bit disappointed by thid DVD but for sure one can learn something from it.",1219276800,2,686,4.496
2350311,3,B000A2ASN2,"This is a BEGINNER-to-INTERMEDIATE BELLY DANCE DVD AND
ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10...

...WHAT TO DO (STEPS)--10
You can see exactly what she's doing from head to toe. She counts the beats out for you.

...TECHNIQUE (HOW TO DO IT) --5
She explains fully WHAT she's doing as she does it but not always how to get a combination of moves to work together. Practicing it several times in a row might help but she doesn't do that.

...PRACTICE TIME--2
Practice is practically nil. And the editing is poor. There are only two repeats per a series of steps in the ""learning sections"" And the second time through a series starts before you know what's happening--even when you're expecting this to happen.

...SENSUALITY--6
Technically, she is very proficient, but there's not a lot of feeling to her dancing.

...BANG FOR THE BUCK--9
There are three choreographies. Very beginner to Intermediate but the last one is ""taught"" in fragments rather than gone through from beginning to end with the student. And there is a section which speaks to the different types of rhythms (And dancers who truly learn to enjoy belly dancing will eventually want to know this)

...DVD TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS--2
I can't really say enough about how abrupt and disconcerting the editing is. Other belly dance DVDs either have you practice in such a way that you know when the series of steps is repeating with a significant pause between each practice OR there is a transition step between each repeat.

Being able to see all of her, both front and back, constantly has an up side and a down side. Being able to see everything you can definitely learn how to do the moves so long as you keep the remote in your hand constantly. (There aren't many repeats at all) However, I find I like having the camera direct my attention to what I need at any given moment--with intermittent full body shots so I can see exactly what she's doing as I get more familiar with the routine. As it stands, when you're just starting with this DVD, in order to keep your left and right straight, you need to decide which image you're going to look at--her or her image in the mirror.

**In the end, I'd say this is a choreography DVD. Precise Technique is verbally explained and demonstrated but not ""taught."" You'll have to practice some of the moves on your own without the DVD.**",1218412800,11,2330,4.624697336561743

I love how there are actual dances that are to a basic enough beat so it can be used with most songs.  I also love how it teaches you how to drum and infact, I intend on doing so after I have seen the about nine or so rhythms they teach.
Not for beginners necessarily and not just for the advanced.",1197590400,,461,3.935483870967742
2350314,5,B000A2ASN2,"Hi everyone,

I got this DVD two days ago together with the 'Bellydance basics and beyond' and I have to say you weren't exaggerating about the quality of these products.

As for this particular one, you get 1h30m of detailed instruction on fundamental aspects like rythms (shown by Raquy), how to accompany the music with your movements when improvising, etc.

The shimmy drill section is especially challenging for me, since here in Spain we're used to a different kind of shimmy. I'll definitely be playing that section quite a lot!!

If you're really interested in bellydancing, I suggest you get both products, the price is excellent and they complete each other really well. You won't regret it!!",1196208000,,702,4.9743589743589745

2350317,4,B000A2ASN2,"This is my first dvd on belly dancing, so its a bit hard to say just how good it really is...but i was pretty satisfied. Jenna does a good job in explaining certain moves, now its a matter of practice on my side to perfection the shimmy. I liked the warm up alot , it loosened up my hips and shoulders in preparation for other practices. I found the section that teaches drum rythms to be very insightful. I was pleasently surprised that i began to sweat in the section of shimmy drills.!!! Wow...its not easy. But i had a real problem with the quality of the video and in some parts the editing is poorly  done. I don't know much about belly dancing but i feel this dvd probably  doesnt cover enough...so ill have to buy several others and see if there are other moves or techniques to learn. I've realized though, with drum solos, its not easy to try and do a choreography that jenna teaches. because i tend to move to the drum in my own ways so...that is a bit challenging.",1188950400,,976,4.27027027027027

2350321,5,B000A2ASN2,"This DVD teaches you how to dance to a drum solo - not to a particular performance or sequence (although there are 4 performances done in detail) but helps you understand the music and as cliched as this sounds, feel the music.

The DVD is well-chaptered, where you can choose a specific segment you want to work on.

Instructor: Jenna

Percussionist: Raqui

Warmup - a bellydance specific warm-up with some hip swirls and such

Choreography Workshop - there are 4 performances or drum solos done in detail. They're supposed to be beginner, intermediate, advanced/expert. Each of these is broken up into 4 segments - performance (done by the instructor in front of an audience), tutorial (step-by-step of each move), learn & practice (loops it 2x, so you can practice) and finally one where you do it in full.

The tutorials are all done in a studio in front of a wall-to-wall mirror with a view of the front and back of the instructor, so you do not miss anything. There are even close-ups of the footwork, at the end of some of the more complicated movements. Another great thing is that there is a little countdown marker at the bottom left of the screen, while the instructor counts it out loud as well.

The tutorials are done at a good pace - slow/explanatory, perform it once or twice. When you move on to the next movement, it gives you detailed instructions on how to segue smoothly from one move to the other.

Rhythm Workshop - Raquy, the percussionist, explains a little about the music. How you can pick up what type of rhythm or style it is just from listening to it. There's also a tutorial and performance by the instructor, Jenna, in how to dance to the drum (and the drummer).

Shimmy Drills - Shimmy Layering Drills, 3/4 Shimmy Drill. These are pretty amazing and it'll really make you work on those shimmies.

Performance, Music etc. which are typical of most bellydancing DVDs.

What I especially liked was how well organized the DVD was. It was easy for you to skip between movements in the tutorial (Choreography Workshop - #2) .. from move #1 to move #2, which may not be a big thing but for repeated viewings or practices this would be advantageous.

Again, I highly recommend this DVD. It is best for beginner-intermediate bellydancers since you do need to know some of the basic movements beforehand.",1170806400,50,2327,4.662591687041565
2350322,5,B000A2ASN2,"Excellent choreography DVD for someone who already learned the basic belly dance moves or to accompany Jenna's first DVD, I highly recommend it!!",1169683200,7,145,5.3478260869565215
2350323,5,B000A2ASN2,I have a lot of belly dance DVD's and none of them is as good as this one. It has a lot of repetition so that you can practice the steps time after time. It has slow motion in certain movements for a better demostration. The Drum explanation is excellent too. It will help you to identify the different rithms and dance accordingly.,1168560000,5,332,4.285714285714286

2350325,4,B000A2ASN2,"It wasn't entirely what I was expecting.

The things I didn't like:

Raquy in general (the drummer).  She seemed a little slow/unsure of what she was saying sometimes, as if camera shy.  And she kinda seems like a hippie and not very forward or in command of the presentation of her knowledge, which lowers my attention level to her immediately.  Though her breakdowns of the beats were simple, and if I had kept the DVD they would have been very helpful.

The quality for some reason looked like crap on my TV, and I couldn't see any costume detail like I could in The Art of the Drum Solo.  I don't know if this was because of a poor filming choice or my TV, which is a flat screen.

It was nice that Jenna danced along to the rhythm after Raquy explained them, but she didn't speak at all during the breakdowns.  To get what combinations worked with certain rhythms, you had to watch rather than have her tell you and then demonstrate which steps work best with a particular set.  That's one reason why I enjoyed The Art of the Drum Solo - it was part instruction and part breakdown at the same time.

Things I liked:

Other than the quality, Raquy being flaky, and the lack of step breakdowns DURING the rhythm breakdowns, it's a good DVD with a lot of content.

I did not go through the choreographies, so that may be why I am missing the step breakdown options that I had expected.  I did like the shimmy layering drill, but it left me wanting more shimmy drills.  I mean, why just put one or two? I was all ready to do other types of shimmies:-)  The performances were excellent to watch, but would have been more so if it didn't look like crap on my TV (this might just be a problem on my end, I have no idea if it's a production flaw).

I have to say the menu system of this dvd was interesting.  There were a lot of options, and you can get directly to the rhythm you want from the dvd menu.  Basically it's broken down enough so you can get to any sspecific place in the DVD without going through things you don't want to.  It's probably the most thorough menu system I've seen on a bellydance DVD so far.

It certainly has a lot of content, and worth the price to have in your collection if you like mimicking and doing choreography to learn new things.  I may have to come back to it later and then revise my review if anything changes.  Hope this helps someone.",1168473600,13,2375,4.252232142857143
2350326,5,B000A2ASN2,"Hi beginners, what do you need ?  Explanations, demonstrations, a large set of rhythms ?  Yes, but Raquy gives you more : In a few words she gives you the fundemantal secret to understand Middle East drumming.  You can't get it somewhere else.  Place the right number of ""Dums"" at the right places and you drum according to the rules of Middle East drumming.  All the rest is a question of ornaments which open a wide horizon to express your personality.

The instructors on this DVD are great at breaking down what you need to know, and the on- screen beat counter is also good for when someone walks in while you're practicing in the living room and you can't hear the music! :) I wouldn't recommend this for raw novices, but anyone who has studied at least the basics should be able to work with this DVD just fine.",1166572800,6,566,4.330188679245283

The drummer is great too, there is even a rhythm workshop with the drummer and the bellydancer.  She talks as if you're right there with her, love it!

2350334,5,B000A2ASN2,"I have been taking belly dance instruction for a little over a year and practice at home quite regularly to instructional videos.  I have quite a few that I have purchased; Suhaila Salimpour, Jamila Salimpour, Neen & Veena, Nourhan Sharif, to name a few.  This one gives a very clear & concise explaination of what is to be done.  The first piece of choreography is demonstrated, explained & practiced to the music.  Then the next piece of choreography is added on in the same manner.  Next what choreography that is learned thus far is practiced in whole until the complete routine has been learned and practiced in its entirety. Each piece of choreography breakdown is shown first at full speed then in slow motion. I particularly like the fact that she is facing the mirror.  This is the only choreography video that I have where this is done and it makes it so much easier to follow along.  In instructional videos for technique it is necessary to see the front of the instructor but choreography assumes you know the technique. Even in class when learning choreography for performance it is done with the instuctors back to the class.

I also highly appreciate Jenna's breakdown of the transitions steps! This bit of intruction is often left out.  I think this DVD is excellent and I too look forward to Jenna's next DVD.",1153180800,13,1326,4.705627705627705
2350335,5,B000A2ASN2,"I'm a beginner and I've never received face-to-face instruction even though I attend bellydancing-style workouts for beginners. This is why I was taken a little aback when I first watched the DVD, especially Jenna's performances.

If you've never ever bellydanced before, you'll need another set of instructions to start with first. I saw that Jenna is making a new DVD (basics and beyond) and I suppose that she will give more detailed explanation in it. I'd say this very DVD is at intermidiate level even though beginners will find it useful just like advanced dancers.

I've read the reviews for almost all DVDs available on amazon and I noticed that usually beginners give high ratings and more advanced dancers are very critical. It seems to me that everyone agrees it's a wonderful DVD and I find very indicative of its quality.

I have to point that in order to learn the moves well, it's necessary to use a mirror especially if you're not experienced/well familiar with these moves. It's easy enough to follow Jenna along but when I cast a glance at the mirror, more often than not I realize they look very little like Jenna's. This is especially true about the hip accents.

PROS of this DVD:

1. It's long and inclusive. It has a warmup, drills to improve technique/ train muscles, a section divided into three groups - at beginning, intermidiate and advanced level. The rhythm workshop is great for learning drum solo rhythms and their interpretations. There are several seperate performances. It's 85 mins. It's great value for your money.

2. JENNA is an example of what a dancer should look like. Her dancing is very refined, she movements - very delicate. She's an example of what it is like to blend mastery with grace. Most of the dancers I'm watched tend to do exaggerated and jerky movements which is very much unlike her and yet her dancing looks just as good, if not better.

3. What I love about it is that it suggests three full choreographies and I got the sense of completion with that.

4. I'm very happy with the shimmy drills. They are a wonderful workout and they also gave me the chance to watch Jenna shimmy for a long time. It made me think ""oh maybe I'll be able to do it like that some day"".

5. Jenna is dancing in front of a mirror. Even though I have a few remarks about that, it's a fairly good idea.

6. Jenna has a good attitude as an instruction. I dislike the fake smiles that so many professional dancers have like *plastered* on their faces (like Neena and Veena). Her dancing is inspiring in the way that it makes you feeling bellydancing is fun and enjoyable.

7. The DVD is organized in nice short segments that you can watch and rewind as many times as you want to fit your needs. You can do it again and again and again. Probably at least 6 months worth of practice is packed up in this DVD.

8. Her performances in the seperate section are quite inspiring. I'm sure advanced, maybe even professional dancers would find them interesting and useful.

9. What I love about this DVD is the traditional dancing. I also got Neon's Crash Course DVD and I was disappointed to hear music you could listen to in nightclubs. There are ONLY typical mid-easterns rhythms included, no fusion.

CONS of the DVD:

1. As a beginner, I was taken aback the first time I saw this DVD. It's very hard at first and Jenna does not give very detailed instructions (what a person who's never bellydanced before would need). However, I think more advanced dancers would enjoy this approach and find too much explanation boring.

2. I saw that someone else complained about not being able to see her feet (if she's on tiptoe or not). I had the same problem. My bigger problem was that Jenna is facing the mirror, not the camera and it's much harder for me to learn watching the back. If I need to watch what she does with her belly I have to stop dancing and stare (I have a small screen). I'm happy that when she performs it's the other way round, so I can get a better idea of how she does things.

To sum everything up, I would recommend this DVD to everybody. It's a great value for many many hours of excercise, combinations, choreography, everything. I have to warn beginners (especially those who've never bellydanced before) that they're likely to find this DVD uphill at first, so I would recommend to them to get another something else as well (Neena and Veena or Neon, etc). I'm sure that if you wait until September for Jenna's other DVD, it would make an awesome first step to mastering the wonderful choreography in this DVD.",1152144000,25,4563,4.558679706601467
2350336,5,B000A2ASN2,"It's been a while since I've been really delighted with a belly dance DVD. This DVD is something special, though! I've been listening to a great Arabic radio station (thank heaven for TiVo!) and was looking for something that would explain Arabic rhythms. The information Raquy presents is enough to justify the cost of this DVD alone!

But there's more to love. Jenna is an excellent instructor *for the late beginner-early intermediate* student. She assumes knowledge of many belly dance steps. As an intermediate student myself, I found this DVD just right. The first two choreos were easy and gave me an opportunity to get accustomed to dancing while paying attention to the rhythms. The third was a bit more challenging -- but fun! As a side note, I loved how Jenna carefully broke down transition steps.

Jenna herself is marvelous. Her stage presence is amazing, and her dancing is naturally sensuous. I adore Veena and Neena, but they should take a lesson from Jenna, and put on a few pounds! Jenna's belly jiggles a bit when she shimmies, and she has *hips*! Woo-hoo! For those of us with a *real* woman's body, Jenna is a welcome respite from skinny-mini belly dancers.

I have just one itty-bitty critique -- I'd have preferred if Jenna did the choreo breakdown in pants that weren't so long. It was hard to see at times if she was on tiptoe or flat-footed.

Otherwise, this is an absolute must-have DVD. I really wish I'd found this DVD much, much sooner. I wouldn't have been able to follow Jenna until I'd been dancing for a while (I'm a painfully slow learner), but I wish I'd known more about Arabic rhythms when I first began studying belly dance. Thank you, Jenna and Raquy!",1149897600,9,1692,4.706081081081081
2350337,5,B000A2ASN2,"Where do I start?
The intro/welcome was great..
The Warmup gets all the major muslces in 8 min...
The Choreography has 4 options for each of the 3 Dance Routine Drum Solos.
1. Seeing the Performance in full costume in front of an audience. 2. The Choreography Breakdown which is her showing you each step 1x slow & 1x normal speed with an occasional ""instant reply"" for harder steps in front of a wall to floor length mirror in a studio for about 8-15 min depending on which routine. 3. The Demonstration which is her doing the routine normal speed all the way through in the same studio w/mirror. 4.  The Learn & Practice which is hearing a snippet of the beat first before each step is taught, then same video of her teaching the step slowly, then again normal speed, then after the 2nd is taught the same way, the first two steps are put together before going on to step three & so on so this portion is about 15-20 min.
The Rhythm Workshop shows you 8 different rhythms, what they mean, where they are popular, how to clap to it & Jenna showing how to dance to it. There is also a Drum Solo Improvisation which Jenna dancing in front of an audience for about 6 min.
The Shimmy Drills is another option
The Performances option is her doing each of the 3 drum solos & the 6 min Drum Solo Improvisation.
The music option tells you what CDs they use & where to find them.

There's the official trailer on youtube, google or myspace.",1149552000,9,1432,4.33955223880597
2350338,5,B000A2ASN2,"A simple, but very very informative DVD. It requires you to know basic moves like hip lifts and the like beforehand (or it makes it easier), but puts these little pieces to good use in whole choreographies. Raquy's drumming instruction is clear and invaluable to both dancer and drummer. A wonderful wonderful product for practice and ideas on how to choreograph dances and drum sets!",1148256000,3,384,4.923076923076923
2350339,5,B000A2ASN2,"There are three complete routines on this dvd: beginner, intermediate, & advanced. So as your skill develops you can move onto the next routine- all on one dvd! So it is a great value.  There is also a rhythm workshop so you can learn to identifyspecific rhythms and improvise. Really beautiful and challenging choreographies that make for an excellent workout.",1144454400,5,361,5.016666666666667
2350340,5,B000A2ASN2,I thought the organization of this DVD was great.  It is great to have her teach you in the practice and learn section for the three dances.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in bellydancing.,1142726400,,202,4.583333333333333
2350341,5,B000A2ASN2,Still working on it. It is pretty good. The title means exactly what it is all about.,1142467200,,85,4.0588235294117645
2350342,5,B000A2ASN2,This dvd is a great way to learn the nuances of dancing to live drumming. Jenna's teaching style is fantastic - she clearly describes and demonstrates the correct way a dance move is to be done and her directions are easy to follow. Raquy is an amazingly talented drummer and an absolute joy to watch. She is also a great teacher of drum rhythms. This is a MUST have dvd for any one studying Middle Eastern dance.,1142380800,,413,4.376623376623376
2350343,5,B000A2ASN2,"Nobody breaks down the choreography and teaches the moves as well as Jenna does and I have watched quite a few instructional belly dance dvds. One thing to note though, this is definately not for a straight out beginner. Its more for somebody who knows what the basics are and wanting to gain some techniques and expand their dance moves. She has become my favourite belly dance teacher. I know she has a new dvd coming out sometime in Summer 2006, I will definately get it. I recommend this dvd 101%!  I wish other intsructors could do dvds as well as this one was done. Good job and for all those raks sharki dancers out there.....Go GET IT! :-)",1142121600,4,647,4.436974789915967
2350344,5,B000A2ASN2,"I cannot rave enough about this DVD.  My comments will probably restate what most have already said here, but I have to recommend this dvd as one of the highest quality I have seen.  There is a great deal of substance for learning drum solo technique.  This video is made for every level, from beginners on drum solo technique, to the seasoned dancer who wants to polish her technique and learn a challenging choreography.

There is a complete warmup on the DVD in a separate section.  Then, the DVD is divided into a Rhythms section hosted by Raquy, an extremely talented drummer.  The rhythms taught include Beledi, Maksoum, Chiftitelli, and Saidi, to name a few.  Raquy offers great instruction and advice on identifying rhythms.  The DVD also has a choreography section divided into three choreographies according to beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  This DVD clearly draws the line between these distinctions.

Each choreography is divided into the following sections: a performance demonstration by Jenna, a section that breaks down the choreography in smaller sections, the full choreography itself, and a section where you can learn the dance with music from the beginning.

Jenna's teaching method for shimmy drills is effective for mastery of the move, especially the 3/4 shimmy.  She points out minute details that really make a difference in a dancer's technique.

Jenna is a wonderful performer and has a very fluid and coordinated style.  Her instruction is concise, and she demonstrates correct posture and technique.

The music for the advanced choreography can be purchased on Raquy and the Cavemen's CD ""Jordan"".

I simply cannot find anything to criticize about this DVD.  This video is probably best for those with a basic knowledge on belly dance moves.  There is material here that is difficult to find with other instructional videos.  I consider this DVD to be a must-have in any one's belly dance video collection.",1140825600,7,1944,5.114285714285714
2350345,5,B000A2ASN2,"I'm pretty new to belly danceing, and have been trying to find a video that helped with drum solos.  Most of them you find are either workout or completly choreographed.  If you ever get into social belly dancing, those don't work to well around the camp fire or an open dance.  This Video really helped break down some moves and went through the rythms so you can figure what your doing if your caught in the spot light!",1139875200,4,421,4.371794871794871
2350346,4,B000A2ASN2,I found this tape to be quite acceptable for a someone who enjoys bellydancing and who  has done bellydancing before. It is very different to most bellydancing DVD's since it concentrates on  exactly what it says ie. Drum Solos. The tuition to me appears to be quite understandable and for anyone who is starting out should still be of value since the instruction  is clear and precise on what one should do.,1137283200,5,408,4.638888888888889
2350347,5,B000A2ASN2,"Wow!  What a surprise!  I found this video to be incredibly helpful and well presented.  I would have liked to have a seen another camera angle on the movements that involve undulations but that's only a minor criticism because what it lacked in a more of a side shot of the undulations...they made up for by slowing it down to really show the turns!  The Drumming from Raquy clearly shows why she is so popular!  I am the Director/Teacher for Gypsy Red Tribe in Birmingham, Alabama and my husband, Ryan is the Director for Karachi Rocket...so originally we bought the video because he wanted to see Raquy but man was I ever surprised!  the Drum Solo stuff is really great both for Intermediate and Advanced dancers that are looking to better understand drum solos...and the Shimmy Drills!!!! Wow!  excellent!  I liked this so much that I even bought it for the other dancers in my troupe!  Great Job!",1137024000,6,901,4.651898734177215
2350348,5,B000A2ASN2,"It is THE best one for beginners to lay a firm foundation. Jenny demystifies some movements which used to be confusing to me into very scientific and neat breakdowns. Just as Jenny said, (once you get the right hang of it), it is only a matter of time of practicing, but the bad habbit takes longer to get rid of. Many belly dance DVDs are presented by famous and elegant performers but not all of them can relate to beginners, they omitted some scientific demonstration only leaving everything to a kind of feelings which is sure important but also unavoidablly left beginners some confusion about some basic movements. Jenny is so different, I benefit a lot from her shimmy drills, her 4/3 shimmy is really helpful to me.",1136592000,7,723,4.65625
2350349,5,B000A2ASN2,"As a Belly Dance teacher, I look at DVD's with a critical eye. This one really impressed me. There are three choreographed dances at intermediate progressing to advanced level. Each one is performed, demonstrated then taught and practised. The advantage of DVD is that in the teaching and practise sections there are clear indications where you can pause the DVD. In the demonstration sections, the beats are also indicated on screen, so that you ensure your moves are on the beat. Jenna also gives useful tips on transitions, layering of shimmy's and 3/4 shimmy.

I also like the fact that the choreographies are done to ""real"" music that can be found on DVD, and would recommend, that if you intend to use this DVD to its fullest potential, you also consider ordering the 2 DVD's that the choreagraphies are based on. They are:  Bellydancing for Fame and Fortune by Amir Naqum Chehade and Raquy and the Cavemen ""Jordan"".

Raquy is also to be complimented on her clear explanations of Middle Eastern Rhythm. It's so much easier when you realise that you just have to listen for the ""Dhums""",1136592000,7,1090,4.787234042553192
2350350,5,B000A2ASN2,"This takes full advantage of being in the DVD format, plenty of chapters to choose from, Jenna is very clear in her instructions, she is definitely comfortable teaching. Raquy simplyfies magnificently the ryhtms, I will be on the lookout for any other DVD they do or workshop they teach.",1135555200,2,287,4.877551020408164
2350351,5,B000A2ASN2,"I've been dancing since 1996 and yet to attempt a drum solo, too fast, too complicated.  Jenna breaks it down and it's easy to pickup.  This DVD is difficult enough to keep me from getting bored, but not so difficult that I can't learn.  Wonderful organization of the DVD, easy menus, great production quality and lighting.

Hope Jenna & Raquy produce something else soon!",1131062400,8,372,4.765625
2350352,5,B000A2ASN2,"I highly recommend this to intermediate dancers.  Even if you are not interested in drum solos, it has a great session on shimmy drills and rhythms.  I was somewhat disappointed in Sonia's drum solo video, and so I was not interested in this one when it first came out.  However, I found it in Ross for only $8.99, and so took a chance.  I am so glad that I did.",1130976000,6,362,4.128571428571429

2350354,4,B000A2ASN2,This is a fantastic video for dancers with some knowledge of bellydance.  It has a lot to offer!  There are three performances that Jenna has broken down in to somewhat easy to learn steps.  The camera angle is a little awkward at times and is the reason I gave this video a 4 instead of 5 stars. The video explains where to get the music so you can actually perform this on your own.  It has a great shimmy workshop/ workout for those of you who are looking to perfect the shimmy. Jenna is fun to watch and has developed fun choreographys.  The video also includes a section that breaks down popular middle eastern rythms-the key to performing drum solos is understanding these rythms. I love drum solos but lack the patience to choreograph.  I appreciate that there are teachers willing to share their talent and ability.,1129161600,8,823,4.5646258503401365
2350355,5,B000A2ASN2,"I rented this from Netflix first, because I have purchased several DVD's and been disappointed.  NOT THIS TIME!

2350356,5,B000A2ASN2,"if you want to learn how to dance to different drum rhythms, this is a great dvd. they break down the different types of drum beats and the choreography step by step. beginners can use this as well as experienced dancers, but if you have never done bellydancing before, you will want to start with a basic moves tape or dvd such as veena & neena, since this one does not break down the components of each move (like how to do an upward chest circle or snake arms, for instance). the performances are inspirational. you get a lot here. definitely one of the best dvds i've seen. highly recommended.",1127865600,63,597,4.4363636363636365

The performances were very good also. Good explainations too!",1127606400,6,185,4.575757575757576
2350358,5,B000A2ASN2,"Finally, a video worthy of praise! As a dancer myself, I can honsetly say that this video is well worth the $$ and is by far one of the best ones out there. First let me say that I would never recommend anyone take lessons from a video, no matter how good it is, without having a personal instructor to help with form and technique. Learning from a video without actually taking lessons from a teacher in person is not the best way to learn anything. Having said that, I highly recommend this video for any level performer as it is done in a manner that makes it easy to understand, easy to see what the moves are supposed to look like, and provides you with a choreography that you can either use or even change to make it a little more your own. The important thing in this type of dance is to understand the music, specifically, the different types of drum rhythms, and this video covers that beautifully, as well! Jenna stays true to the authenticity of the Egyptian dance, and for that I highly commend her. Raquy is a phenominal drummer and while she seems to be more comfortable performing rather than teaching, she still does a wonderful job of teaching the basic rhythms. Wonderful all around instructional video. A great guide for those who are already taking lessons, or for instructors to use as an additional learning tool for their students.",1126742400,13,1355,4.53469387755102
2350359,5,B000A2ASN2,"Jenna and Raquy have put together a great instructional DVD for all but the highest level of dancer.  I am at an intermediate level, and I have plenty to work on with this DVD.  Jenna's technique is very technically clean, and her emotive style is natural and pleasant.  She is natural with the viewer, and also with her dance.  You have seen the other videos with other great dancers that can't speak or their dance comes across herky-jerky on screen. Jenna is encouraging without talking down to the viewer or being repetative.  I loved the shimmy layering drills and will get a lot of practice to clean up my technique, the REALLY simplified way that Raquy teaches how to identify different rhythms (an A-HA moment here!), the different levels of drum solo work, with the additional improvisational drum solo (or duet as they like to say) That is very inspirational.  The warmup is a good basic one that gets the job done without being tedious. I have paid a LOT more for different bellydance instructional DVD's and this one is the cheapest, as well as one of the best.

It was detailed from the warmups, to the lessons, and the drills. Jenna and Raquy appear focused on teaching and learning in this video. What was even more impressive was that there were no hidden agendas here. Absent were oiled bodies, crowded sets, mediocrity, ""superstardom"", or carved-up physiques when I am trying to focus on the entire dancer. There was no music video nor porn cinematogrophy, which respected the people on screen as well as the people who buy this dvd. It is a great value for the dollar. Just goes to show what happens when women literally handle their own business...",1125014400,14,747,4.936507936507937
2350362,5,B000A2ASN2,"Jenna is a great teacher and this DVD is so helpful.  The warmup is very thorough and provides great preparation for the rest of the DVD, or whatever parts you pick to work with.  The choreographies are broken down in a couple of different ways.  You can either run through the whole thing, or you can learn a section then put it together with the music before going onto the next section.  Parts that may be confusing, such as a turn going into the next step, are shown in slow motion up close so you can see what your foot placement should be.

The dances are fun to learn and are taught wonderfully.  Jenna explains everything very well.  You can watch her dance to the routines in full costume in the performance section of the DVD, with some variations.  She even does an improvisation piece with Raquy and another drummer, Carmine.

The section with Raquy is very informative and fun.  She familiarizes the viewer with different rhythms while Jenna dances along.

I think the best part of this DVD is the drill section.  You can work on shimmy layering and the 3/4 shimmy.  I have yet to complete each part successfully, but I'm having fun in the meantime!  It's a good way to get used to these difficult moves.

Hopefully Jenna puts out more instructional Dvds in the future.  This one is a lot of fun and highly recommended!",1124841600,19,1332,4.510460251046025

You can ""Learn and Practice"" or you can watch the Demonstration of three different pieces with varying difficulty. It makes it easy to break down one step until you learn it, or just plow right through and have fun with it. A few of the moves are a little tricky, so don't think its all easy-peasy and boring. Also, there is a segment that introduces the various rhythms. Drum Solos are the most fun to watch, so I was anxious to learn to dance to one. The viewer can see Jenna from the back, but you can also view her movements from the front since she faces a mirror for each demonstration. She breaks down the 3/4 shimmy drill and you learn a lot about belly dance itself as well as some cool choreography! The only reason I wouldn't give it that 5th star is because the DVD quality is a little grainy and that's the way its shot. Other than that, this is a great introduction to Belly Dancing and especially to Belly Dancing for drum solos.",1349740800,,1095,4.372549019607843
