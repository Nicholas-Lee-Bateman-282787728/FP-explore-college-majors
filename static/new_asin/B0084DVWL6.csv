5130560,5,B0084DVWL6,Came across a picture of the movie about 4 hours ago and it interested me to the fullest to the point that it's the first i've actually paid for to see online. It teaches us the greatest lesson in life which is to love the ones that hurt us the most. Thanks to Jesus and then to the one of the idea of making this movie. It changed my life in a way... TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. Gracias Dios mio por este mensaje bello.,1341964800,3,413,4.048780487804878

I think the camera was more steady in the Blair Witch Project.  Not to mention the terrible message behind the movie...I mean, the bible verse that the father reads right before she starts visiting is the one about how god won't forgive you unless you forgive others...so from that I get that if someone rapes you, you're going to hell if you can't forgive them.  That is a horrible message to send to rape victims, most of whom justifiably hate their rapists.",1494374400,,528,4.655913978494624

The movie is a lower budget film and as far as the acting goes, the main character and her family come off as ""odd"" at times, however, ""the bad man"" of the film adds a real edge to the film and is pretty believable as a loose canon. If you can get past the lower budget qualities of the film, I think you'll find that it's actually pretty good. It makes you think about your consequences and how one decision can affect your life forever! This was definitely a different type of ""christian film"" but I am glad I added it to my collection!

5130573,1,B0084DVWL6,"This film is bad in so many ways, it astonished me.

The music, camerawork and editing were awful. The story was incoherent, and most of the acting ranged from very bad to mediocre. Scenes that seemed like they were supposed to show character development were so abrupt and badly-written that they just made the characters behaviors seem bizarre.

I generally hate reviews that are like fifth-grade book reports, telling the story, but I need to go into detail to describe how bad this film is.

When we meet her, the main character, Julie, is a walking stereotype  she is a super-good, put-upon Christian, with a boss who whines about her religious zeal. She lies to get a shoplifting kid out of trouble, then manipulates him into promising to come to church. She wears a Got Jesus? button and a self-righteous air.

I will give the filmmakers credit for the possibility that this was all intentional, that their point was that she isn't a truly-tested Christian yet, just holier-than-thou. But its not clear.

Her nerdy co-worker, Cole, seems as if he is only there to make her look mainstream by being even more stereotypical -- he might as well have nerd with a crush stamped on his forehead. He puts a foil-wrapped something in the microwave  sparks fly, but not with her  get it? Then he does the hand-to-hand hot-potato bit, apologizes for saying shoot when hes burned, asks her out bashfully and is refused. Were talking bad burlesque dorkiness here. But read on . . . he may be the key to the whole film, and its true message!

Julies family is unpleasant. Dad is insulting to both kids and his wife. He also has an odd habit of referring to his kids, and addressing them, by both names  not in anger, but like a classroom teacher who has multiple Julies or Joeys in the class, and needs to make it clear which one he is calling on.

We also meet the auto mechanic and future rapist, Mike. He is surrounded by angry men and women in low-cut tops. Hes under lots of pressure, has a hair-trigger temper, and drinks heavily. Got it.

Julies car breaks down near a sleazy bar, which inexplicably leads to the rape -- the bartender pressures Mike into helping her, she offers to pay him, he flies into a rage, then chases her down, and, we assume, rapes her.

The rape scene and police processing montages are filmed like a fantasy  I think they were going for nightmare, but it didn't work.

Scenes continue to go back and forth between Julies dilemmas and Mikes prison life. The gist of Mikes world is that the white supremacist gang members dislike him, especially one named Tyler. There is bad blood, of course, between this gang and the Latin and African American gangs. They are all teeny-tiny low-budget movie gangs  3-5 members each, and so full of swagger they can hardly walk and talk. An older inmate, Cecil, played by one of the few decent actors in this mess, takes Mike under his wing.

During a backyard cookout, Julies Mom tells the whole family that the doctor just called and told her Julies pregnant. HIPAA, anyone? Julies 23 years old  why would the Dr. tell her mommy the news?

The parents instantly decide on abortion, Julie instantly decides to have the baby, and they instantly argue. They might have all had time to think of the what-ifs previously, but we haven't been shown that, and the scene is rushed and badly-done. The parents are pretty typical of the no abortion is moral except for mine mentality  only Julie is the True Christian who wants to have the baby.

Cole the seemingly-unimportant ex-co-worker (Julies not working -- her parents are now supporting her) shows up at the cookout. Julie thinks her parents have set up the meeting and are matchmaking, and storms out (well, flounces out). Anyway, this dorky guy suddenly becomes less clumsy, solemn with wisdom for the parents about appreciating how wonderful Julie is. Hmmmm . . .

We also find out that his Christian mission is finding markets for indigenous music from poor countries , which made me wish they had used some in the film, instead of the awful Churchpop!

Intercut montages of Julie giving birth and Mike being incarcerated are next -- very cheesy, with more bad music.

After dealing with her fussy baby one night (which is actually a montage of a fussy Julie pacing about with a totally calm baby!), Julie seems distressed (shown with another montage, which I suspect is because this actress could not show a sustained emotion in one shot). She looks at a cross on a shelf, that has the Love is patient, love is kind . . .  text carved into it, and smiles.

Then we see her make a little scrapbook of Bible verses, crosses, and pictures of the baby, herself and her family. We hear a voice-over of her paraphrasing Luke 12:47-48:
But the one who did not know his masters will, and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive only but a few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more.

So you see, the poor rapist didn't know better, not being Christian (how did she know he wasn't raised as one?). But she should know better, and must do more.

I guess. Who knows?

Who is the scrapbook for? Why, the rapist, of course!  But she doesnt take it to him until much later in the film  first she leaves it in her room, and her father finds it and reads a passage about forgiveness.

Julie has taken the baby (!) to visit Mike the rapist in prison. Her cheery demeanor, starting right in with smiling and chatter, is just bizarre. He is freaked out by it, but she keeps trying. So now we cycle among scenes of Julies life, Mikes life, and Julie visiting Mike in prison.

After a few tries, he agrees to see her, and is suddenly softened up when she tells him the babys name. The fact that he is immediately charmed when he hears the kids name is unbelievable (and no, she didn't name him Mike  this movies weird enough without that!). I think the filmmakers thought they set it up by his seeming a bit more open to her visits at that point, but they really didnt.

Julies father finds out about the visits  oh, didn't I tell you Julie had been lying about where she was going all this time? Yeah.

While Mikes mentor, Cecil, is telling him that God takes the worst things we do, like, oh . . . raping people, and uses them to redeem us by having our victims forgive us, Julies father is calling her a conniving little nutcase, and screaming that he didn't take out a second mortgage on the house to support a little son-of-a-rapist baby. Oh, such contrast!

Julies father throws her out. During her next visit, she tells Mike its OK because Jesus said families would be divided, he tells her Thats stupid and challenges her to get back with her family. While they're visiting, Cecil is killed by Tyler.

Mike accepts a Bible from Julie, and the scrapbook also shows up in his cell at this point (Why now? Who knows?). He reads a bit of the Beatitudes, hearing them in her voice at first, then reading aloud (he accepts the ideas for himself  get it?). After great is your reward in Heaven he looks up, grins right at us (is it still called breaking the fourth wall when its the ceiling?) and repeats in Heaven.

And then he goes right out and beats up Cecils killer, Tyler, and starts a prison riot.

Huh? I guess were supposed to think he didn't fully understand the message, or just needs more time, but it is badly done. The previous scene really seemed like the Big Conversion. But I guess not. Why? Who knows?

Julie is refused access to Mike at her next visit, pouts at the guard, then becomes completely broken down, running to her old job to incoherently pour out her heart to Cole, being snippy and sarcastic, then needy, begging for help, but not knowing what help she needs. Among other things, she says the baby cries constantly  when was that? He seems like an exceptionally quiet baby to me.

And, again, Cole is the calm, Christian hero, telling her she still has more to do, that she has to stop trying to make everyone love her, and just trust Jesus.

But then Cole gets vulnerable, and asks if Julie loves Mike (ew). She explains, in what I guess is supposed to be the pivotal scene in the film, that what she is doing is all about forgiving Mike, because God wants her to do so. Shes got it all figured out  she is calm and sure.

Wait  wasn't she just a total mess, begging Cole for help and saying she didn't understand anything? Giving the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt again, I think some of this was an attempt at showing various facets of the characters personalities, and gradual growth, but it is so clunky that it doesnt even come close.

Cole goes to her father and convinces him of the true value of both of his children with a few calm statements. Then he brings them all back together so Dad can apologize to Julie. We get hints that Julie just might be getting romantically interested in that superman, Cole.

Tyler contracts with someone from outside the prison to kill Julie and the baby.

We don't really see when Mike became non-violent, but another character establishes that it has been a month since the riot, and Mike now says, with a Bible in his hand, when I read this, I don't want to hurt anybody any more. Exposition -- quite an art.

Mike is told that Tyler is planning to hurt Julie and the baby. He is asked if he would die for his child. So I guess we are now set up to wonder if Mike will choose one more act of violence, to protect them. I suppose his telling someone (a prison official? Julie herself?) is something were not even supposed to hope for  one of those prison code things?

Julie takes her father to meet her rapist. Why? Why not? We haven't done that yet. Dad is aggressive, Mike is apologetic. But Mike saying I stole something that didn't belong to me and apologizing for taking her away from her Dad both seem to come from a mindset that says that women, and their virginity, are things that belong to men. Ick.

Mike sends the only other guy in the prison auto shop away, asking him to tell the guards that someone has been killed. The white supremacists come in, and (surprise!) their leader (played badly by the movies only name, Steven Baldwin) kills Tyler. Then he kills Mike, who bravely welcomes it.

This ties things up nicely, but doesnt make a lot of sense. Mikes accepting his murder seemed more typical prison bravado than faith in Jesus. Well, he does say were good to his killer, which I guess is tough guy for I forgive you. And he smiles up at the ceiling light beatifically as he dies.

But there was nothing about Mike's actions that protected Julie and the baby from Tylers plan. The white supremacist leader decided on his own to kill Tyler before killing Mike, and to reassure Mike that the hit on Julie has been stopped. Its a completely random piece of good luck (well, not for Tyler). There was no way Mike could have expected that sacrificing his own life would somehow protect Julie and the baby.

I guess its a good thing Mike didn't rape a non-white woman, or she and the baby would have been goners.

The film ends with Julie reading her family a letter that Mike wrote when he knew he was destined to die, thanking her for bringing him to Jesus. Lucky Julie  she gets all the credit, and Mike is conveniently dead, so she need not worry about his wanting to continue the connection when he gets out of prison, which would be just as their son hit the teenage rebellious years. Whew!

When I first heard the basic premise of this film, I was afraid it was just a rapists wet dream of having the woman he attacked not only forgive, but befriend him, which would be offensive and unrealistic enough.

But, now that Ive watched it, I think its more likely that its the wet dream of clumsy geeky Christian guys, since dorky Cole became the hero, and showed the woman who was out of his league what a Real Christian is, and how much sacrifice she had to make to get to that level.

Whether the filmmakers thought they were making a film about Christian forgiveness, or about trying to be a better Christian through many trials, I think they failed miserably at any goal, including making a watchable film.",1458345600,11,12207,4.485094850948509

5130589,1,B0084DVWL6,"If you are a nutty Christian (different from a normal Christian, which I am), you may like this movie. But it's bad acting, a bad premise, bad film work, and generally implausible.

The beginning really drives home that the main character is CHRISTIAN CHRISTIAN CHRISTIAN and PROUD OF IT. From praying over her meal, to singing along with Christian music, to volunteer work with her church, to helping a little boy that she knows from church, to very conservative outfits (skirt, blouse, plain makeup and hair), even to a call out to God when her tire pops, we are led to conclude that SHE IS INDEED CHRISTIAN. Gag.

The beginning also drives home the point that the eventual rapist is a BAD GUY. He looks slimy (nice peach fuzz/pedo-stache, buddy), beats up his boss at work (equally slimy), skeeves out a guy and his young daughter, and then has flashbacks of being told what a loser he is as he consumes copious amounts of alcohol at the local SEEDY BAR. But the buildup to the rape makes no sense at all. It goes from him helping her with her tire, to getting angry when she offers money (to be fair, she doesn't seem to get when it's time to just stop trying to force money on the dude), to suddenly chasing her down and then...fade to black. What? How does that escalate to rape? Seriously.

From there, it just goes downhill. Further, I can't understand how she gets pregnant from a rape when she was taken to the hospital the morning after it happened. It is standard procedure to give rape victims the morning after pill. If nutty Christians don't believe in the morning after pill, then it should have been made clear in the film. Not everyone would know that.

The bad acting came to a head when the mother announces during a family barbecue that the doctor called and said Julie is pregnant. The ensuing conversation is comparable to a bunch of high schoolers doing a first script read-thru for the spring play. Julie's brother, who also seems skeevy, plays no useful role, and neither does her coworker who randomly shows up. Her parents are actually the only sane ones here, arguing that this is one of those extreme cases where God would understand an abortion. But Julie makes an impassioned speech, clearly hellbent on defying her parents' supposed vision for a perfect Christian life. Julie up to this moment has been even more hellbent on perpetuating this. Frankly, her parents have seemed downright normal throughout the movie, so Julie's attacking outburst just seems bizarre.

And as icing on the cake, as other reviewers have also noted, the film work is too bright, too handheld, and too homemade.

Hopefully I've convinced you to just move on, unless you're a nutty Christian. It's just not worth the effort, and I'm very, very glad I didn't pay money for this.",1400198400,10,2787,4.677551020408163

5130591,4,B0084DVWL6,"This movie brings up the question - ""how much am I able to forgive?""  When we think about Jesus forgiving those who were murdering him while they were committing the act, the answer should be  - ""everything or anything.""  Yet this is seemingly impossible when we are clearly wronged as Julie was in this movie.  In reading the comments of others, I do not think the filmmakers were stating that women who are raped should keep their babies and visit the father's in jail, I feel the point was being made about the power of love and forgiveness.  In the movie Julie's loving, kind, forgiving spirit spread to those around her and changed them from selfish, self-centered individuals to selfless forgiving ones.  It made me think about the times when I've held a grudge over something small - something someone said or did that really didn't matter in the long run.  It takes true love to let something go when someone has hurt you.  I felt this was clearly portrayed in this film.",1398384000,3,979,4.618497109826589

5130595,5,B0084DVWL6,"I love the practical down-to-earth realism of the film, especially Julie's family. The way Julie's emotions bounce from shouting and disrespect and near breakdown is so true to life. It's so true that we can be so spiritual on one hand, yet so carnal and emotional on the other. It's the paradox of the ""treasure in earthen vessels"" (2 Cor 4:7). Plus the families emotions are so realistic, like someone hid a camera in the kitchen and we watch people in their raw emotions. It's like the movie was made from unplanned and unrehearsed candid family clips.

I work with prisoners many hours a week, and the prison scenes are also very realistic. I've shown it to my excon friends and they agree and were deeply moved and wanted to buy the movie for themselves.

No woman would bounce back from such a traumatic experience and place their own child in this environment.  I think that this movie glossed over the intense hurt that is experience when a woman is abused.  Other parts of the movie I enjoyed.  I do believe that God can provide healing and forgiveness in horrible situations.  I think the movie could have portrayed this better.  I believe when you understand the intensity of the pain you can fully grasp the greatness of forgiveness.  This is a movie people should watch and make up their own minds about.

5130606,3,B0084DVWL6,"I loved this movie and it was very inspirational, but I have a very important question--where was the gospel? This was dubbed as a Christian movie but Mormons, JWs, Jews, Muslims, and all those into works-righteousness, all could have agreed with the premise of this movie that forgiveness and turning from unrighteousness to righteousness is a way to get to heaven. But that's not the gospel.

Some, while recognizing they are sinners, are hoping their good deeds will outweigh their sin so they will be good enough people to earn God's favor for entrance into heaven. While virtually all religions outside biblical Christianity teach this the Bible precludes such a way of righteousness. Why? Quite simply because there are no good people: ""There is no one righteous, not even one"" (Rom. 3:10; Psalm 14:3; 143:2), and all ""good deeds"" done in our own perceived righteousness are not accepted by God, for ""all our righteous acts are like filthy rags"" (Isa. 64:6).

Why are ""good deeds"" done in our own righteousness not accepted by God? Because even our ""good deeds"" are defective. No one performs acts with pure motives, for ""Who can say, 'I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without sin'""? (Proverbs 20:9).

Real righteousness means that we should conform ourselves to God's righteousness. Trusting in Christ's righteousness alone is the only way one will receive God's righteousness. Why? First of all because God's character is perfect (Matt. 5:48; Lev. 19:2), righteous and just (Psalm 89:14). The standard He demands is based on His character and cannot be lowered. Second, we must realize we are sinners who are incapable of measuring up to God's perfect standard and His righteous and just character. To make this right God graciously offers us the perfect righteousness of His Son, while at the same time making Jesus a sin offering for our failure to measure up:

""God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God"" (2 Cor. 5:21).

This verse is preceded by the statement that, in the case of those He saves, ""God was...not counting men's sins against them"" (2 Corinthians 5:19).

While Jesus was a sin offering for us (Rom. 3:25), He Himself had no sin (John 8:46; 1 Pet. 2:22; 2 Cor. 5:21). Jesus was able to ""offer himself unblemished to God"" (Heb. 9:14) because He submitted Himself under the law of God and obeyed it perfectly. By His obedience, Jesus Christ earned or merited eternal life for us. Jesus Christ was the only person who has ever obeyed perfectly all the demands of God's law (Matt. 5:17). Therefore, He became our righteousness before God.

How do we receive this righteousness? By placing our faith and trust in Jesus' finished work. Faith, in its essence, is a renunciation of any human attempt to meet God's demands (Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5; Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:20; 3:26-28; 11:6; 2 Tim. 1:9), but is trust and reliance in Christ's righteousness alone (2 Cor. 5:21).

The moment our faith and trust is no longer in ourselves, but in Christ alone, God imputes the righteousness of His Son to the believing sinner while he is still in his sinning state. This was true of Abraham (Gen. 15:6). It is true of every believer in Christ (Ps. 32:2; Rom. 3:22; 4:3, 8, 21-25; 2 Cor. 5:21). All of our sins are charged (imputed) to the account of Christ, and His righteous standing with the Father has been imputed (charged) to our account.

So, what is the real gospel? 1 Corinthians 15:1-5 says, ""By this gospel you are saved...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, He appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living.""

This passage, which outlines the gospel, tells us that:

1.  Man is a sinner.
2.  Christ had to die for our sins (we cannot save ourselves).
3.  God proved His justice in that sin had to be dealt with.
4.  God proved His love for us in that He sacrificed His Son.
5.  Christ rising from the dead, proved that sin and death were defeated.

Christ's victory over sin and death is offered to you as a free gift. If it were ""by works, [then] grace would no longer be grace"" (Romans 11:6). ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast"" (Ephesians 2:8-9). ""His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the One He loves"" (Ephesians 1:6). ""I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life"" (Revelations 21:6); ""whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life""(Rev 22:17).

You must put your faith in Jesus Christ alone. God will accept no one else in heaven except His perfect, Holy Son and those He cloaks in His perfect righteousness. For if we could be made righteous before God by our own good deeds ""Christ died for nothing"" (Galatians 2:21).

How much of the above message came forth in this movie? Yes there was mention of Jesus and His death and resurrection, but no context was given. No details were filled in. When one scene showed Mike reading the Bible in jail it was all about forgiveness and peace making (works-righteousness). Okay, what is that forgiveness based on? There was no point in the movie where Julie actually shared the gospel detailed above. Like I said, religious people into works-righteousness to get to heaven likely loved this movie.

If a movie is going to market itself as a Christian movie, the gospel better be there in clear and in full details. Sadly, this movie fails that test. And I was amazed that not a single review I read (I may have missed one though) catched this.

5130607,1,B0084DVWL6,"I am a Christian.  I also work with survivors of sexual assault for my job.  Daily I talk with women whose lives have been torn apart due to sexual assault.  Yes, the Bible says we must forgive, but there is a big difference between forgiving someone in your heart for your piece of mind and baking your rapist cookies and becoming his best friend.  This movie disturbed me so much because there are many Christian women who have been raped and this movie sends a completely unrealistic, and dangerous, message about the after-effects of it.  If you want to make a message about a rape survivor at least make it somewhat realistic.",1373241600,23,631,4.598214285714286
5130608,2,B0084DVWL6,"[SPOILERS]

I am pro-choice and this to me involves the woman following her faith and judgment, including if she thinks abortion wrong even if she was raped. So, I respect the premise. The makers of the film might not see it quite the way I do, but I respect the premise. The lead actress also does a pretty good job, especially since she seems not to have much experience. Some of the others do okay. I realize this is a low budget affair and take some notice of that. Likewise, the film is a message movie, not some great work of art.

Still, find myself giving it a below average review, including because I had to turn it off an hour in since it was so dull and amateurish. I think this weakens the point of the movie too. First, I don't think the film does a good enough job leading up to the first visit between the rapist and the woman. In effect, it looks like she has a quick moment of insight (she's caring for the baby, she suddenly is distraught and then looks at an inspirational sign -- this all seems to take a minute or two) and then decides to pop up at the prison. Really?

The basic idea is realistic. People who were raped have had their child. People who were victims of horrible crimes have forgave and even met the person in prison. But, you don't just show up without notice with the baby! Warning to good doers -- don't try this at home. The rapist also seems to change pretty fast. First, he is this angry guy who beats up his boss and is drunk/rapes. Seems much more calm once in prison. Then, is bonding with some older black (interracial harmony!) mechanic/Morgan Freeman fill-in. Not great character development.

There is also some prison drama about white and black gangs in prison ... I ff thru that though again shut things off before finding out what happened. I was interested in the subject matter but it was not handled that well. Some might appreciate it because they support her decisions and her faith. I think even then you have to judge the film as a film. It's lacking there. The charm here is that you have to remember it is partially entertainment, not just a message movie. Jesus after all used parables to get the people's attention.

There is a kernel of good material here.",1370217600,,2223,4.399026763990268

Arturo Fernandez (Rossi) did such an excellent job as the bad man rapist, Michael. His drunken rage and hopelessness the night of the crime, his anger and disbelief when Julie shows up at the prison with their baby, and his guilty joy when he realizes the horror of what he did but that it somehow brought him the most beautiful relationship in his life were all amazing performances. Don't get me wrong, this is a Christian friendship love, not a romantic love. But he was a lost and lonely man and he was introduced to Jesus by the most unlikely source, his victim. The other actors in the prison scenes were all also excellent. I particularly liked Pedro Moreno's performance as Manny. Stephen Baldwin did an excellent job but his part, while important, is not that large. I thought the musical score was too loud, cloying, and a little too obvious.

I can not just blame the writing although they did make her almost a caricature of a young Christian woman. We never got to see her depression or her grieving process as she worked towards what she had to do. And I do not believe Miss Kelly can act well enough to cry on demand. Unfortunately, this story should have had a lot of tears. They had her wipe her face a lot but she never believably cried. When Michael apologizes to her father, you see a tear slip but even then I think it was just drops and not realistic at all.

5130619,1,B0084DVWL6,"Try to keep in mind that the notion this movie promotes, that forgiving this rapist and getting to know him and his troubles will somehow benefit the victim and her kid, is simply a construct.  It is a work of fiction, not a proof of concept.  The writers could have made Julie turn into a watermelon if they wanted to.  Just because someone write the story this way does not mean that it will work this way.  If you get raped, feel free to do whatever floats your boat, including bake the rapist cookies, but, do NOT judge others who decide that they would rather burn their rapist alive or drown him in feces than forgive him.  Reality seldom follows a script.

This movie does a disservice to real victims of violence.  There is no empirical rationale for the notion that forgiving a rapist will make you feel better.  This movie has the potential to make people who have suffered REAL violence feel even worse because they don't forgive their tormentors like the FICTIONAL Julie.",1364515200,11,983,4.577142857142857

5130621,3,B0084DVWL6,"Not sure about this movie. The beginning was a bit ridiculous - within the first ten minutes the main character, Julie, has led the prayer at breakfast, spoke about the help she's going to be giving to troubled youth, worn her 'Got Jesus' pin at work, and helped out a young boy stealing poptarts by making him promise to go to church with her.

Sometimes subtle is best, but this film certainly didn't think that.

Next you have Julie's tire blowing out, in which she then enters one of the shadiest bars you've ever seen to find help. Instead of waiting patiently in her car for reputable help to come, she asks the scary looking young man bent over his beer bottle. Not too bright.

The rape scene is done discreetly, but there is no way I would consider this a family approved film, like it says on the cover. There is way too much violence in the prison scenes.

So now, we have our rapist behind bars, and Julie pregnant. Somehow she has put the rape behind her with what seems little emotional reprecussions. I agree with another reviewer who said Julie's character is somewhat one dimensional and I have hard time believing that this innocent young girl, who had her virginity stolen from her in a horrible act of violence, would have recovered so quickly. She seems to take the pregnancy in stride, but while she shows remarkable maturity in this, she talks to her dad like a disrespectful teenager.

It was also a little odd watching her so cheerfully visit her rapist, with big smile and all, and continue to visit him even when he didn't want to see her. I know this was the whole point of the movie, God loving the rapist through Julie, but I had a hard time with the believability.

The prison scenes were well done. Stephen Baldwin slinks through them like a deadly cobra ready to strike. And I did find myself investing some emotion into the rapist's story.

So while I found the message behind this movie was a powerful one, I struggled with the character of Julie. She just wasn't real.",1360540800,15,2004,4.519337016574585

5130641,4,B0084DVWL6,"What happens when your life is turned upside down by the thoughtless actions of another?

In this film we follow the main character who is raped, and then gives birth to a boy.
We follow as she copes, deals with and learns what it means to truly show forgiveness..

The story is very good, the filming is excellent... the acting does leave a bit to be desired from a couple of the characters.
Baldwin's character itself seemed forced and fake.
Yet the key two characters did a great job at leading you through their emotions.

This is a great film.  You will be challenged about how you react when someone hurts you and we don't forgive...",1345161600,3,639,4.482758620689655

The main actors did an excellent job, their roles where very believable, you will fall in love with them, even the Bad Man. It is a great story of forgiveness and redemption, I highly recommend this movie to any one over the age of 14. There is some violence that I would not want little children to see. Other than that the movies is great! Enjoy.",1343692800,8,493,4.24468085106383

It looked like someone taped the movie with a home video camera. I got a headache trying to watch the movie, I would not have completed watching, but I really enjoyed the story and wanted to see what the outcome was.  I would recommend this movie, but be aware of the quality of the film.",1342569600,19,457,4.341176470588235

8525070,1,B0084DVWL6,"The message of this movie is that it is the victim's duty and obligation to forgive and even actively love those that have harmed them. The main character is a young woman who is randomly attacked and raped, which leads to pregnancy. She chooses to keep the baby and then decides that God wants her to forgive her attacker and introduce him to his baby. She seems thrilled to do this, exhibiting no hint of the trauma and fear that victims feel toward their attackers. When her family finds out and is understandably upset, they are portrayed as the bad guys.

This movie perpetuates the extremely harmful myth that if you are simply nice enough to someone, they will change and become Super Nice Perfect Christian Guy. This myth is the reason women are encouraged, forced, or guilted into staying in abusive relationships. They are blamed for their own suffering for not being loving enough or submissive enough or forgiving enough.

On top of the misogynistic nonsense that is the story, the film itself is badly made. The cam was so shaky it made me sick to my stomach. The production quality is on a level with daytime soaps. This movie has NO redeeming qualities.",1521417600,12,1168,4.692682926829268

8525072,5,B0084DVWL6,"It's a little cheesy in production but overall great message!
It's one of those, oh come on!! movies but the principle behind it is what matters. She forgave the man after what happened and I think those are the times forgiveness is the most important. We need to learn to forgive, especially when it's hard to do!
Probably more of an older teen movie because there's some violence and mature themes but it's still clean, if that makes since. There was only mild cussing, one h***, that I can remember.
Again, great message, but seems it was low budget",1520553600,,552,4.585858585858586
