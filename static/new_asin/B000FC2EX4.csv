8120617,5,B000FC2EX4,"Who says Thieves have it easy? Lupin figures it out in this particular volume.

The Bride Came D.O.A
-The unthinkable happened; Fujiko married a rich man and Lupin killed her for it! A spiteful and jealous move that ends with him blowing himself up. Is this the end of line or are we playing a long possum con?

Dark Charade
-When an old friend calls on Jigen for help, he's willing to jump in and help out. Even though the gang isn't too peachy about it. What's the favor you ask? Why drop into the middle of a civil war and evacuate the political leader of the loosing side, no pressure

Lupin's Psychic Fiend
-Zenigata's loosing streak is starting to put pressure on Interpol to catch Lupin. So how are they going to fix the situation? Why hire a psychic of course. The lady may seem all smoke and mirrors, but when all her predictions start coming true, it'll make even the stoic Jigen start believing in it

Ice, Robot
-They say diamonds are a girl's best friend. So what does that mean for the inventor of a robot who with a few squeaks and clanks can spit out diamonds by the bucket loads? These ain't falsies either, pure real deal ice, but that secret can't be kept quiet for long and suddenly a New York gangster wants that robot and is willing to kill for it

Baton Death March
-They say music can sooth the savage beast, but this particular artist is to die for. But anyone who hears it will be the one to do the killing. The newest hit on the classical scene is a fellow named Kyoranski, with his diamond studded baton in tow, he can bring down the house, literally and figuratively, and any thief who gets wise to try and swipe it will be facing an entire pack house of hypnotized killers, Lupin better pack his ear plugs or he's gonna need a wooden coat.",1523664000,,1769,4.332326283987915
8120618,4,B000FC2EX4,I loved this show based in the comic books of Monkey Punch. It follows the adventures of master thief Lupin the Third nephew of the French Arsene Lupin and his gang composed by Goemon Ishikawa a master samurai and Deitsuke Jigen a cold blooded gunman. Sometimes joins to the band Fujiko Mine a bussom beautiful lady expert in conning and also thieving. Where the most valuable or expensive treasure or antique is Lupin the Third and his gang trying to rob it. The Dvd has 5 episodes that are in order as they originally broadcasted with the preview and even the commercials break. The series are well translated and the voices of the dubbers are quite similar to original japanese. The only flaw in this Dvd is that the English subtitles are the translation of the Japanese version not the English dubbed version. Sound and picture quality are more than average. I will wait for next volume.,1145404800,2,891,4.681528662420382
