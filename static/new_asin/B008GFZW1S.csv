5581422,5,B008GFZW1S,"One of the best animated animal tales I have seen in a while. Strong characters and plot and well placed songs. Im at a loss why others have given this movie such a low undeserved rating this is very much a five star movie if you love animated talking animal videos. Maybe it could be scary for five year olds not every animated video is ment for those under five. There are humans in this movie, the main character is Jock the dog. Standard animals can talk to each other but not humans type movie. Talking animals in this movie are as follows Jock a dog, his mother and litter mates, a rooster, and a few monkeys. This is very much a dog lovers movie however.",1352246400,5,661,4.253968253968254
5581423,1,B008GFZW1S,"The world has a ton of dog related movies to choose from. There are classics like 101 Dalmations and Lady and the Tramp, live actions like Benji and Hotel for dogs, and thousands of horrible, stale, cliche dog movies like Air Buddies and... Jock the Hero Dog. This movie is basically a waste of packaging. The animation looks like it came out in early 2001, the plotline is full of cliches and monkeys (even though it is supposed to be a dog movie), and the entire movie is beyond boring. Even my 3 year old sister who will watch anything if it has a puppy in it hardly paid attention, and she is too young to know about bad 3D modeling and way too young to compare it to other movies. The movie is basically about a dog who is a runt (what a first) who is trying to prove himself (I didn't know that was coming either) and help his master find gold in Africa (Which I do not think even has much gold to mine...). The movie is so downright horrible you will want to (1.) smash the disc or (2.) get a refund.",1348099200,4,1007,4.142857142857143
5581424,1,B008GFZW1S,"Even though it isn't available on Amazon for another month, I purchased this movie at ""WallyWorld"" this past week. Blindly having faith in the advertisement and the seal of Family Friendly entertainment I began watching it with my 3 year old. Big mistake! Within the first 20 minutes the violence and animal cruelty had my son in tears. The story line might be find for older kids (10 and older)but I do not want my young son being exposed to people drowning dogs at gun point nor animals being injured or dying due to stages animal fights.
Just a warning to do your own research on this movie before purchasing it....oh and by the way I only paid $12.96 @ Wally World, not $20 + shipping!",1343606400,10,689,4.476190476190476

5581426,3,B008GFZW1S,"At the end of 2007 Duncan MacNeillie, together with a small team of animators, relocated from Nelspruit to Johannesburg to start production on what would become Jock the Hero Dog.  It took a team of 25 animators 3-years to complete the film. Midway through 2009 the decision was made to complete the film in Stereoscopic so as to capitalize on the popularity of 3D computer generated feature films.  The end result was released (domestically) on July 24th, 2012 and arrived to DVD on September 25th of that same year.

First thing you are going to notice about Jock the Hero Dog is that there is no shortage of critics willing to tear the film apart on just about every conceivable level.  To be honest, coming from a world where Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks have spoiled us with literally all a computer animated feature film could & should be; the animation quality of Jock is going to come up short.  Considering 2012 wasn't all that long ago, one sort of expects a higher degree of visual presentation.  However, I am a big advocate of the theory that pretty graphics do not a good movie make so that being said does Jock overcome its visual limitations to deliver a solid story?  Well, yes and no.  On the one hand its a sweeping tale painted against a South African landscape at the turn of the century.  Its based on actual events and encompasses the idea of the bond between man and dog.  On the other its a bit unfocused on its intended audience.  It lacks almost any and all humor and a few of the themes presented are rather melancholy by nature.

First, lets talk about the good.  The vocal cast is quite stellar including the efforts of Helen Hunt, Ted Danson, William Baldwin, Mandy Patinkin, Donald Sutherland and singer/ songwriter Bryan Adams as the titular character.  Acting quality far surpasses the animation despite the fact that Donald Sutherland narrates the piece as Sir Percy Fitzpatrick though Theo Landey plays Fitz throughout.  Granted, perhaps they were hoping to convey the notion that he was much older when recollecting on the past events of his life, the mismatch in voice isn't subtle and would likely confuse youngsters trying to get a lock on who is actually telling the tale.

Additionally impressive is the fact that the film is loosely based on the 1907 book Jock of the Bushveld; the true story by South African author Percy FitzPatrick that told of his travels with his dog, Jock, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, during the 1880s, when he worked as a store-man, prospector's assistant, journalist and ox-wagon transport-rider in the Bushveld region of the Transvaal (then the South African Republic).  As such, some historical events and period-accurate details make up the framework of the film.  A glimpse of historical fact is always welcome in a film designed to cater to audiences of all ages.

As the film was originally created to accommodate an English-speaking cast, mouth flap timing and natural dialog integration is top notch.  This may sound like minor praise but until you struggle through a foreign CG animated film dubbed into English and come to realize this practice brings a whole plethora of issues into the formula.

Now the bad. It appears when developing the film, its creators lost sight of the intended audience on multiple occasions.  Factual events are blended with child-appealing elements such as talking animals and evil primates don't mesh quite as well as they should.  Additionally there are many unnecessary supporting characters scattered throughout the film that do little to nothing to advance the prose.  Presumably integrated for kid-appeal, the end result only makes it harder to suspend disbelief in the tale.

In all, once you get past the clunky, floaty animation, there are some redeeming qualities to Jock the Hero Dog.  This one is probably best viewed as rental material.",1390694400,,3858,4.896923076923077

5581428,3,B008GFZW1S,"A remake of a classic 80s South African film Jock the Bushveld which was based on the true story written by Percy Fitzpatrick about his runt of a dog who became a hero, that was first published in 1907.  The main problem with Jock the Hero Dog is that it is trying to appeal to both the tell the historic story through education crowd, as well as trying to make, what in all honestly was a pretty horrific for animals at the time story, into a child appealing film. It's animated and the imagery does look all right, it has the 3 dimensional look to it but is a long way off better animated films with animals where you can see every single hair in their fur.  But visually it's okay, and they have gone and gotten big enough names from Hollywood (and for some reason Bryan Adams who voices Jock) to try and pull the film along through the characters' voices, which no doubt would put a lot of South Africans off side who you'd imagine would have preferred their national heroes (well Jock at least) to be voiced by local actors.  Archbishop Desmond Tutu does have a few lines as a tribal elder. Donald Sutherland, Ted Danson, Helen Hunt, and Mandy Pantinkin are probably your most well known actors.

Jock the Hero Dog is not a dogs become superheroes, spies or other such nonsense tale.  If you're a fan of Jack London's White Fang and books like that, well that's the sort of thing that's brought to the screen here.  There is a lot of tension in the air for Jock and his dim-witted out of his depth and comfort zone master, a nerdy fella who believes he's going to find his fortune in gold.  Bullies, con artists, and humans (plus a monkey) deal out a fair bit of violence to each other and animals to get what they want.  You've got to remember this is set in the 1800s when violence towards animals wasn't just condoned, it was also entertainment with events like dog fights a common occurrence.  This historical sort of stuff is in this film.  So we have that dark always there aspect, but then we have the talking animals who can all understand each other such as chickens, dogs, boars, monkeys, (except we humans aren't aware of course) which tends to dumb down the story.  We have an unrealistic scene with a Cheetah and without giving it away then ending of the film is ridiculous, farfetched and so far off the real story it's ridiculous and seems to be there just to please those wanting a feel good what did we learn today end to the film.

The film starts off with probably the most irritating song playing in the background I think I've ever heard.  Adams and other artists provide a better soundtrack throughout the rest of the film so don't turn off the DVD because of it.  For some reason as well, maybe Adam's plane was late or something, Jock (who is a male dog) is voiced by a girl at the start of the film, even though the whole film only takes place over a very short period of time.  It's worth watching once just to learn a bit about history, I mean Australia, Canada, the USA all have parts of our country affected by the Gold Rush in this period of history that were pretty similar so from that point of view, it's not a bad film for kids to see.

I actually liked the extras better than the movie (note the Amazon page says the DVD doesn't come with any) but the Australian version does.  The features you see the actors voicing their roles, and you learn about the real Jock of the Bushveld as well as why he is important to South Africans.  I actually had no idea this was a true story until I started watching the extras.",1370908800,,3553,4.34947049924357
5581429,5,B008GFZW1S,There is a lot of information in this movie that lets children know some lessons in life they could encounter.  Knowing how to apply what they seen in Jock in life's day to day expectations compared to their own situations.

5581433,2,B008GFZW1S,"The animation is okay but man this movie is just missing ""it"".  It's tough to watch.  You have zero attachment to the characters, and it's just overall really ""weird"".  Maybe I'm spoiled by Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks or something but this was pretty rough to watch.  I have no knowledge about the story and how accurate it is to the real story, but regardless of that this just was not very entertaining.  It was also a little too dark and scary for my 5 year old as well, and the scary parts just seemed pointless and out of place.",1356998400,,534,4.353535353535354
5581434,1,B008GFZW1S,"This is a brave attempt at South Africa's first 3d animation, but it is truly ""the worst dog movie I have ever seen"". This is a wonderful true story of a truly heroic little dog straight from the History books of South Africa. This animated version does nothing but make a mockery of the truth and the whole way the ""Story"" has been formatted in nothing less than a blatant lie.
As a tale of historical events, the story cannot be made light of, or changed in any way. Even though, as an animated movie, it is intended for young viewers, but watching this, i felt was an insult to South African history, and human intelligence as a whole.
Absolutely a waste of money to purchase, and not recommended to watch!
