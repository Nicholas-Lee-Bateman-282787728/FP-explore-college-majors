7845376,5,6303401899,"Zanussi has been one the most talented and gifted Polish Directors of the Post War generation. All his films are worth seeing, because are of great breath, audacious and originals. His inspiration is based on events of strong realism in which the limit situations are reached and surpassed.

After a composer feels his inspiration has vanished and there is no reason to live will be faced and even healed by the entrance of a young and mysterious young man who will aid him to reexamine and give himself a second air in his career.

An admirable life `s lesson.",1140912000,2,561,4.656565656565657
7845377,5,6303401899,"This story of human connection and inspiration is a rare find. Apart from the excellent acting, the story spine links us all to life, art, creativity, birth and death. And forgiveness that breaches traditional boundaries and allows us to explore our inner stirrings, our unanswered questions. And in the end, it's a feel-good story about re-birth and the gifts we can give daily, no matter how famous, infamous, ordinary and exemplary in our singularity and uniqueness. This movie touched me deeply and I would hope it does you.

Max von Sydov present not by mistake, as there is so much in common between Zanussi and Bergman films. Excellent music. Love  this movie. Too bad is so expensive. Worth it any way.",964137600,6,277,4.653061224489796
