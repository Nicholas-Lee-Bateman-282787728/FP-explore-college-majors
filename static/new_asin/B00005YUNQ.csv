1676746,4,B00005YUNQ,"Originally, I had expected this to be typical made-for-TV fare but I was wrong.  The story of Mermaids being not-so friendly and not always beautiful was incrediblely detailed and well-done -- all the way done to the reworking of what I call ""The Ecology of Mermaids"" (something which the Japanese have done, but never got around to the Western world).
The actors do a riveting performance and the direction is great.  And the mermaid is definitely a mermaid -- sexy, exotic.  The special effects surprised the heck out of me as they really poured the money on this one.
The story follows a circus troupe (one of who poses as a mermaid) that finds a live captured mermaid and hires a crew to help them bring it across the ocean to America (of course things don't go quite as planned.)
A well-written thriller along with great special effects.  This along with SCI FI Channel's DUNE has to be one of the best made-for-cable features to come around the past year.
Oh yeah, there is nudity and violence, but it's not explicit ""fan service"" kind and really is part of the story, so don't let the kids see it 'cause it can get intense.  I'm getting this DVD when it comes out, that's for sure.",1012780800,8,1188,4.5327102803738315
1676779,4,B00005YUNQ,A very stylish and we'll made horror / fantasy film. It's got 1st rate actors and an impressive creature.  I hope it comes to bluray soon.,1449964800,,138,4.3076923076923075
1676780,4,B00005YUNQ,Enjoyed the movie. Bought it because Carla Gugino is such a great actress. She has played such diverse characters and I believe each one. She performed well in this movie and I bought it because its one you can see more than once.,1449360000,,230,4.372093023255814
1676781,5,B00005YUNQ,Great Evil Mermaid Movie..  Set at the turn of the century this movie features great characters and a great scary story.,1441497600,,120,4.714285714285714
1676782,4,B00005YUNQ,"Released to TV and video in 2001, ""Sea Creature"" is about a couple of carnies (Rufus Sewell & Carla Gugino) in the early 20th century who come across a real mermaid in Ireland (Rya Kihlstedt), which they apprehend and intend to transport to America as a freakshow attraction. Horror ensues. Reno Wilson and Gil Bellows are also on hand.

Originally called simply ""Sea Creature"" the movie was unnecessarily burdened with the overlong title of ""Mermaid Chronicles Part 1: She Creature,"" which doesn't make sense since there's no ""Part 2,"" although the ending leaves room for that possibility.

The movie plays like a modern-day Hammer flick with elements of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" ""Species"" and ""Alien/Aliens."" While it lacks the budget of those three films, the production is comparable to those Hammer horror movies that take place during the Victorian era. ""Sea Creature"" also shares similarities to 1961's haunting ""Night Tide"" with Dennis Hopper, which also was about a (possible) mermaid.

There are three basic settings in the movie: The opening carnival sequence that segues into a (sorta) castle sequence and, lastly, the long ship sequence that takes up the bulk of the story. The last one reveals the greatest weakness of the movie in that sailing on a ship is a limited setting, which makes for a little dullness here and there, but the flick makes up for it with an over-the-top horrific last act. The renowned Stan Winston was on hand as producer and you can tell with the excellent F/X of something revealed at the end, which is on par with the Aliens, Predator, and Pumpkinhead movies. No kidding.

While a TV movie, ""Sea Creature"" is adult-oriented in that the mermaid is top-nude the entire movie (the horror, the horror!) and there's at least one overt simulated sex scene. Keep in mind, however, that the movie was shooting for realism and not raunch; not to mention that redemption and comeuppance factor into the equation.

BOTTOM LINE: Despite a couple of dull or dubious scenes, ""Sea Creature"" delivers the goods for those who appreciate Hammer's haunting Victorian-era films, as well as movies like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" albeit understandably no where near as lavish as Coppola's film. Carla shines in both beauty and acting chops, as does Rya (who's been married to Bellows since 1994); and Sewell plays a superlative protagonist. ""Sea Creature"" shows that a quality product can be made on a TV budget.

The film runs 91 minutes and was shot in California.

The acting is superb, the special effects are excellent without being overwhelming, and the story hangs together well.

On a separate note, I believe the only reason for the R rating is the nudity. The mermaid is always topless. Never in an offensive way, but you see her breasts several times otherwise, it would be pg-13 I think.",1356393600,3,468,4.650602409638554
1676868,3,B00005YUNQ,"She Creature is a silly romp inspired by the old Creature Features tv program of the sixties. The story is well written, well produced and charmingly acted with Rufus Sewell as the manager of a band of 'down on their luck' circus folk at the start of the 20th century. Eager to make his fortune he attempts to charm (read swindle)an old captain who claims to have a real mermaid in his possesion...and of course the mermaid turns out to not be what anyone expects.

This film is a delightful and lighthearted production with good special effects. The violence depicted is minimal -any violent attacks occure off screen. The amount of sex might make this not the best choice for the youngest viewers, but its really not purient or blaitent, it's relevent to the story as the stress of a difficult sea voyage or perhaps the dark power of the mer creature begins to affect the crew and the circus folk. Fever dreams and fantasies abound as the ship falls off the charted course...Who -if anyone - is in control?",1342051200,,1008,4.6

1676871,4,B00005YUNQ,"I did a Sci-fi DVD search and this popped up, I decided to take a chance figuring this to be a low budget, poorly written, flop with bad acting.  I, of course, recognized Rufus Sewell and Carla Gugino and thought it would be worth a shot.  It was!  You can tell there was not much in the budget for this movie but they made a good decision in billing these 2 in the lead roles, they most likely saved this one.  It's been likened to old B creature flicks like ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" (which would make an interesting remake, don't you think) and that is a good comparison.  In a more modern perspective the creature / mermaid sequences are very well done.  The creature makeup and effects are also well done.  The actual ""creature"" design and animation leaves a little to be desired but can be largely overlooked when taking the movie as a whole.  The writing would rate a B, the storyline itself an A-, the directing a B+, the set a B+, the computer generated FX a B. mermaid makeup and design an A, and the acting an A- (with an A+ performance from Carla Gugino).

This is a welcomed addition to the Sci-fi creature genre and should be used as a touchstone.  So many of these are codemned to poor acting, poor computer generation, poor writing, and low budgets that makes this truly refreshing.  It proves low budget does not have to be synonymous with low quality.  This is worth adding to your collection,  you'll watch it occasionally.  One note though, it does have some nudity, not alot but some along with adult themes and sci-fi violence (duh), so might want to keep the kids away.  Check it!",1324771200,,1610,4.447098976109215

I have been active in LGBT rights for about 10 years now, and I have loved Mermaids my entire life. So, I was quite delighted to discover a LESBIAN FEMINIST MERMAID. It is definitely NOT a kids' film, but for any lesbian, feminist, Mermaid lover, LGBT rights activist, mythologian, budding Robert Langdon, horror movie fan, or any combination of the above, I highly, HIGHLY recommend ""She Creature"". Special effects by the same guy who worked on Aliens, Terminator, and Jurassic Park...such an awesome film for those who want to be scared but not gored out a la ""Saw"" or ""Amityville Horror"".",1321056000,,674,4.769230769230769

1676904,5,B00005YUNQ,"I have watched this movie many times and it always creeps me out -- the mermaid is so alluring and so deadly. But she's just being who she is! The acting is wonderful, the setting claustrophobic (trapped on a boat!!), the story line is so not Disney. You feel sorry for the folks who become fish food but you can't hate the Mermaid Queen for taking care of her own. A real twist on Female Empowerment! I expected very little when I first watched this movie but it was a pleasant surprise (well....a gruesome surprise)it holds up well & I've shared it with many friends.",1312502400,,569,4.428571428571429
1676905,3,B00005YUNQ,The end was weird. The mermaid turned into some huge grewsome beast. It didn't make sense.,1276473600,,90,4.6875
1676906,4,B00005YUNQ,"Occasionally, a film will slip under the radar and get by almost entirely unnoticed by the Horror community at large. Films like DAGON, BLOOD MOON, or CASTLE FREAK will fall into obscurity without ever receiving the attention they deserve. Such is the case in SHE CREATURE, a Creature Feature release that went straight to TV, but offers the polished professionalism of a studio picture on a greatly reduced scale. A carnival hawker steals a living mermaid from a desperate old man, but he and his crew fall prey to the creature as it lures them to their deaths aboard their ship while en route to American. The period setting for the film is entirely believable thanks to the incredible set designs and costuming, creating a High Gothic look that calls back to Murnau and the Universal classics. Stan Winston's creature work for the mermaid is nothing short of amazing, blending the actress into her fishy lower half evenly while also allowing for realistic movement. The alluring siren transforms into a nastier beast as they approach her home island in the Atlantic, where Winston introduces an even more menacing and impressive serpentine design with a unique Lovecraftian appeal. In a refreshing change for the modern monster film, all of the practical creature FX are performed in frame, giving the beast a stronger on screen presence and frightening reality. The unfortunate limitation with this is a rather weak transformation sequence, but given the strength of the rest of the film, it is easily forgivable. This is a must-see for all creature fans!

1676908,5,B00005YUNQ,This is a remake of one of the cheesiest 1950's horror movies I've ever seen.  A hypnotist has control of the she creature who rampages all over the beach front tearing up property and people willy-nilly.  I fully expected the new She Creature to be of the same quality but in color.  I was stunned at the new movie.  The story is terrific and actually makes sense most of the time.  The actors are excellent and their fear is palpable as they begin to realize that the mermaid is killing them off at will.  Carla Gugino is really excellent as the female protagonist who bonds with the monster.  I own this film so I can have access to it whenever I want to see it yet I usually only watch it when I find it on cable unexpectedly because it sems like a real treat.  I highly recommend this is you like very scary movies.,1231459200,2,820,4.245161290322581
1676909,3,B00005YUNQ,"I'd just come home one day and flipped on the Tv remote switch and tuned in to SCI-FI channel and 'She Creature' was on.

I was smack right in the middle of the movie scene without even knowing what the beginning of the story was about. The funny thing about this film is, it was just too predictable. I didn't even have to know that Miss She-Creature was suppost to be evil, because I already knew that she was evil without knowing that she was.

I really enjoyed the mood of the setting, since I have thing for water and wanting to be near the beaches. However, I thought the ending of the film was - SUPER D-U-M-B. I personally think this film could've had better production, but it was almost like watching a B-rated film that held some really good shooting scenes with a professional camera crew, but with a story lacking some depth.",1216944000,,838,4.4

1676911,5,B00005YUNQ,"I love a good monster movie, and SHE CREATURE is fantastic! It's not just a showcase for Stan Winston's (Alien, Terminator, Jurassic Park, Pumpkinhead) creature effects, as wondrous as they are. There's a really good, effective story to hold it all together. In short, a carnival sideshow front-man named Angus (Rufus Sewell from Dark City) and his star / girlfriend, Lilly (The ever gorgeous Carla Gugino) stumble upon what appears to be the opportunity of a lifetime. A REAL mermaid! Angus simply must have the hypnotically  beautiful creature at any cost. This leads to criminal activity culminating in death. Angus secures a ship to America to hit the big time w/ his newly acquired attraction. Once at sea, the horror begins. SEA CREATURE is an excellent example of a terror tale spun right. The characters of Angus and Lilly are more than 1-2 dimensional villains. They are flawed humans w/ both good and bad motivations. The mermaid (Rya Kihlsted) herself is far more than she seems. She displays so much with just a glance of those darkly alluring eyes! I cared what happened to these characters. So, when things started to unravel, I was along for the ride.

This particular film is a highly literate and well-directed story of an 1800s' carnival huckster who greedily steals a REAL (and sexily good-looking and bare-breasted) mermaid with the intent of using her as a traveling exhibit.  Unfortunately--during an ocean voyage to the United States from England--things don't work out as planned, and chaos and terror ensue as the film builds to a horrifying climax.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  One caveat: for some reason, the volume of this DVD's soundtrack is very low, and you'll really have to crank-up your system in order to hear what's going on!",1163462400,3,762,5.221311475409836
1676945,4,B00005YUNQ,"(3.5/5 stars) Curious that Stan Winston's name had his name stamped all over this production, given the fact the creature effects factor so minimally in the film. Nonetheless, this is a pretty cool grade B horror film. A group of English hucksters kidnaps a real, live mermaid despite warnings from her captor. They plan to head to the states to make a fortune on the sideshow circuit. Wise move, or not? Similarities with ""King Kong"" aside, this made-for-cable movie has much going for it: it makes good use of its limited budget by establishing a decent atmosphere, adapting a good story and getting some believable performances from its cast. In fact, lack of a large budget might be an asset for a horror movie because it forces the filmmakers to be resourceful and work within their budgets in order to be effective. Films, such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Halloween"" come to mind as being successful because they relied on atmosphere, story, music and characters rather than special effects and established actors. Given the dearth of mermaid stories, seeing the legendary creature come to life in a horror film is a singular treat. I cannot very well compare this to the 1956 movie by the same name because I have not seen that one. On its own merits, however, this one is good.",1156723200,5,1292,4.746666666666667

It's a shame that the monster at the end is neither of those things. I highly recommend watching the movie the second time with the commentary on, so you can learn how the tricks are worked.

I really enjoyed She-Creature. This hearkens back to old B horror films from the 60's and 70's. Sure, there are some cheesy acting (especially on the part of the old boyfriend character) and gratuitous nudity. But I thought the mermaid was very cool, and they did a decent job with the creature's back-story and costume. In particular I liked the mermaid's tail, and the graceful way it moved out of water.
This is a good film for those who like tough intelligent monster films and creatures with a plausible motivation. Well done!",1088294400,6,859,4.548387096774194

IT just seemed like another one of those cheesy horror flicks (though it aint) it had some elements to it but all in all I was completely bored. Mermaids are cool, especially this one because she was hot and it was the only reason I watched it, but I watched the Peter Pan movie that came out in December of 2003 and it was a better acting version that Robin William's one. The mermaids in that movie were evil (because it is in the original book). This mermaid is evil too, but more sexy. It's not the worst and it certainly isn't the best.

This film reminded me of the horror films I watched as a kid- creepy but not completely terrifying.  It could be disturbing for little children because the beautiful mermaid is not like the Disney version mermaid AT ALL.  Teen may think it is cheesy and hokey, but baby-boomers will find it enjoyable.",1085356800,3,468,4.602409638554217
1677011,4,B00005YUNQ,"Like many others I was impressed by this movie.  While the intent was to remake old B-Movies in sort of a new B-movie style, I actually witnessed a film full of quality.  It's a story of mermaids, but these mermaids aren't like the ones you know...they feast on human flesh.  The fact that they are every bit as beautiful as the fables tell us means that they are that much more dangerous.
With Stan Winston handling the effects, you know it is impossible to be dissapointed.  But can the acting, directing, and story live up to this top notch standard?  The answer is, yeah, just about.  I had no problem with the acting except that the accents weren't always convincing (many characters are from various countries.)  The directing also was impressive aside from a few minor pacing issues, and lastly, the story is actually such an original idea I'm a little bummed it never got a theatrical run.  No, it never would have been number 1 in the box office or even in the top 5, but it could have made a lot more money than it did being made for the Showtime channel.
Unfortunately Ive heard the rest of Winston's Creature Features aren't as good.  I have seen Earth Vs. The Spider which impressed me about as much as this film, but the remaining three in the series have received some bad reviews.
All in all, the film is definetly worth every cent I paid for it.  Unfortunately, horror movies like this are increasingly hard to come by.  Without relying on cheap humor which I find out of place in most horror movies, this movie can actually make your skin crawl and make you think.  Beware!  Bwahahaha....ummm, yeah",1074124800,7,1616,4.550173010380623
1677012,5,B00005YUNQ,"I RENTED THIS MOVIE .. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE ANOTHER BOORING ONE..  BUT TO MY SURPRISE I LIKED IT! IT'S A GREAT HORROR FLICK, AND A NEW WAY TO SEE MERMAIDS.",1067731200,3,164,3.823529411764706
1677013,4,B00005YUNQ,"Saw this last night on Showtime, and was VERY surprised to find that it was very good.  From the title and the venue, I figured it to be some ... horror movie (you know the type - the director is the nephew of someone high up in the studio, or some [stuff] like that).  I was quite pleasantly surprised.
The production value here was quite good, using sets that were well-thought for the film.  Camera-work was excellent, and the editing worked perfectly.  The most surprising thing was that the acting was top-notch, usually the one place where horror films skimp.  Everyone in the film worked hard at meeting their roles well, with one of the centerpieces of the film being the leading lady exercising a strong monologue with a mirror, convincing herself that she isn't crazy.  Worthy of a standing ovation, had it been done on Broadway.
Combine this with a surprisingly good premise, and none of the usual Jason-style monster tricks, and it comes out a winner.
Note on my scale here:  There are really only three horror movies that I'll give a ""5"" to - ""The Thing"" (1980s version), ""An American Werewolf in London,"" and ""Sleepy Hollow.""  There is a very large and empty gap of films that qualify for a 3- or 4-star rating, since most tend to be just plainly...  This is an exception.
Try it - you'll like it.

1677014,4,B00005YUNQ,"OK, I admit it: any movie Rufus Sewell does, I will watch and probably buy.  That's just the way it is when you're an American fan of a British actor who isn't Hugh Grant!  But I'm no horror movie buff, so I probably wouldn't have bothered with this one otherwise.
And then, what do you know, it's better than I expected!  Looks beautiful for the low-budget nature people keep mentioning, all dark and spooky but somehow lovely.  Of course Rufus is in good form, as always...  Carla's great, and the mermaid's so well-done and sympathetic that when she does go psycho you actually kind of root for her.  (Except when she goes after our boy, of course! )  Wish the movie had taken more time with its characters, been maybe a half hour longer, but I guess that's the nature of the genre; this was the best of the four creature-features Cinemax/HBO did...  I'd love to see the sequel implied by the last moments of the film, too.
Would like to have seen more stuff on the DVD, but things like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings tend to raise your expectations there.  Only films that make truckloads of money can go to those lengths!  I'd buy this one even without the commentary and so forth.  Great flick: fun, scary, pretty... more than you can usually say for a ""creature feature!",1044662400,12,1278,4.4655172413793105

The fascination between the two leads, Carla Gugino, & Rya Kihlstedt (the She Creature) could have made for a very erotic film, but nothing really happens. Carla's character is continually drawn to the large tank holding our seductive mermaid, but then just as you expect, or hope something to happen, it doesn't.

1677038,2,B00005YUNQ,"Yet another CREATURE FEATURE presentation, SHE-CREATURE is a remake of a 1957 sci-fi flick.
The plot centers around a conman (Rufus Sewell) running a bogus circus sideshow featuring his wife (Carla Gugino) playing a mermaid. But one day Sewell stumbles across a REAL mermaid (Rya Kihlstedt) who has enormous sex appeal, as well as a lust for human blood. Predictably, Sewell seizes this once in a lifetime opportunity and steals the mermaid and places it in a tank aboard a ship bound for America, but soon it becomes apparent that the creature is messing with Gugino's head, and the ships crew learn about the mermaid's diet preferences the hard way.
SHE CREATURE has good performances by Sewell and Gugino, but the movie is a bit too talky for its own good and there's no real suspense to speak of, but there are a couple of gory scenes and a VERY low key sex scene in which sexy Gugino is briefly possessed by the She-Creature's savage libido.",1037923200,5,946,4.704819277108434

Even so, I was still pleasantly surprised by what a good find the movie turned out to be.
The fun script, solid acting, and turn of the century setting and feel all contributed.  The story was Lovecraftian to me, especially the metamorphosis of the mermaid on the creaking schooner.  Wonderful stuff. If this sounds like it might be fun, you just gotta go there but if you want excessive gore you'll probably snore.",1033257600,5,565,4.744897959183674
1677041,4,B00005YUNQ,"This may be my first DVD purchase from Sony Pictures ""Creature Feature"" collection but, if there are others with the same cynical tongue-in-cheek humor, imaginative twist of storyline, and horror- drama thrills, it will be the first of many! Thoroughly enjoyable! Who would have ever thought that the mysteries of the deep could be so deliciously dangerous!
Rya Kihlstedt plays the She Creature (the word ""mermaid"" lacks the depth and dimension to describe her) while Rufus Sewell and Carla Gugino (as Angus and Lillie) play an exploitative carnival-sideshow couple whose sense of humanity is sufficiently diverse to be exploited by a more subtle, more ruthless mind! Together they play an interesting variation on the menage-a-trois theme. The supporting cast does a praiseworthy job too! They magnificently keep the movie sailing on above the dramatic limitations of filming 95% of a story on board a poorly-lit wooden ship!
However, there's plenty of color added to the story by greed, sensuality, antagonism, distrust, patience, lies, seduction, past histories, propriety, humor, etc. Excellent sound effects and music help emphasize moments of possible telepathic communication and psychic possession (even impregnation of female by female!); also, precognitive dreams in restless sleep heighten the suspense and help define what dreadful fate awaits ... unless ...!
Anyhow, an atmosphere as dreadful as a mysterious Marie Celeste tale is created, then, with tensions heightened, tightened ... agonizingly tightened ... ah! But, you'd best view this movie yourself to know what happens next! If you enjoy horror-thrillers, you won't mind the suspense of the wait! And the movie?

1677042,5,B00005YUNQ,"Finally, a tale that seems to pay homage to the old monster genre without taking away some of the modern movie appeal (or the reason they should be appealing). Now, I'm not one for spoilers (and despise them, actually), so I won't try to flash the high points of the movie away. Instead, I'll say that the concept of the movie, a mermaid being something that could be sinister (as well they should) and a bit unpredictable, actually kept me watching. It went outside of the normal bounds of this otherwise restricted character, giving the creature an ominous tone even when it wasn't horrifying. The supporting cast also propelled the movie forward, doing a superb job acting (and dying) to the delight of this hard to please audience. This, added to the fact that the build worked out and there weren't huge holes in the storyline made me glad I picked it up to watch.
All in all, I have to say that this movie was a wonderful breath of fresh air in an otherwise stagnant time for movie making, giving effects without CGI (something I like, but don't have to have) without sacrificing the integrity of modern effectiveness. Also, the clarity of the movie is superb, the storyline works really well, and the creature - o, the creature. I have to say that when Stan Winston puts his seal on a project, you know it'll be done right (well, the effects will be done right, anyway).

1677043,4,B00005YUNQ,"Rufus Sewell and Carla Gugino star in this low budget creature movie about mermaid who eats human flesh. Stan Winston did the creature effect so it can't be bad. The story is good, about a couple of circus people who stole a mermaid from a drunk old captain and want to bring it to America. What they don't know is the mermaid is no fairy tales creature but pure terror. The horror starts after the ship in the middle of the ocean where the mermaid grows stronger.
Stan Winston provided a feature length audio commentary. The DVD provides both Wide Screen and full screen versions of the movie. Th pictue quality is fine considering this is a made for cable movie but the sound quality is disappointing as it is in Dolby 5.0 so the bass is surely missed and the sound is a bit soft, you have to turn up the volume more than your regular setting but that aside this is a great creature movie that is very entertaining and exciting too.

Although the other films in the series were no doubt entertaining, She Creature might have been one of the only ones to carry a sort of dark ambience with it throughout the film. She Creature has sort of a classical horror tale feel and held out on the over the top monster effects until the very end. This was a fantastic descion, because it creates a tension when watching. The beautiful mermaid has a hideous side, but we are only led to imagine at first. What is also fantastic about this film is how the viewer is lurched into cheering for the She Creature. Her horrendeous treatment more then justifies the death of ever man on the ship. It is also interesting when put under the ""gender lense"". It seems like this straight forward film could have a subcontext to it. Men exploiting the representation of the body of the feminine, and that mute passive beautiful concept exacting ferocious revenge on thoes very men, eating them whole, and then bonding with the one sympathetic female through their common ""gender related"" attributes.

The creature devours them but is drawn, seductively almost, to Guginos character. Rated R for the sexual situations and top-side female bewbs, and even moreso for the gore, this creature feature while standard on story delivers in the area of practical effects. Its not a great movie but is a decent creature feature in the style of older creature flicks though it works at earning its R rating.
