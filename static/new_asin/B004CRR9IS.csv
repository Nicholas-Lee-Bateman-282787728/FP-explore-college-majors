4328069,5,B004CRR9IS,"I have been a huge fan of 30 day Shred since it came out and never thought that Jillian could improve upon that DVD.  Everything works in 30 Day Shred, everything is sore for days after that workout.  Well, let me tell you she has outdone 30 Day Shred this time and muscles that I didn't even know I had are sore this time around.  I am in average shape and started out on level 2 which was doable, but I definitely had to modify a lot of the poses.  Plank pose is no longer my friend, but I may change my mind once my arms are ripped as I am sure they will be in no time at all.
Jillians personality also really shines in this DVD, she's funny, personable and in general just makes the time fly by and you forget that she is KILLING you more and more by the minute.  It's the same 3-2-1 sequence as 30 day shred only somehow the cardio and strength training seem far more intense than they do on 30 Day Shred.  The music is so much better than on 30 day shred as well...and the set design much more interesting.  All in all, it's a really intense workout in a limited amount of time that I already know will get results, judging by how hard it was to move when I got out of bed this morning.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Jillian fan, anyone who has some pounds to lose or anyone who is in good shape but wants to improve upon their physique.",1299024000,11,1360,4.011111111111111
4328070,4,B004CRR9IS,"I have several of Jillian's previous workouts, including 30 Day Shred, No More Trouble Zones, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and Six-Week 6 Pack.  I had been worried that this newest workout would be repetitious and similar to her other workouts, and, while some of the moves are from her other workouts, overall it's a great DVD to have, and I'm glad I got it to add to my Jillian collection.

This DVD is also a great value since it has four workouts on it.  Although the DVD cover (and Jillian herself in the introductory segment) say that each workout is about 24 minutes long, by the time you factor in the warm-up and cool down, they are closer to 35 minutes each. Within that period, you get a really intense workout since your heart rate stays elevated for most of the workout. The idea is to do the first workout for one week (5 or 6 times that week), the second workout for the second week (5 or 6 times that week), etc.  As with her other workouts, this one also includes a modifier in each segment.  You will need a mat and two or three sets of different dumbbells in order to do the workout.

Like Jillian's 30 Day Shred workout, this one also follows her 3-2-1 format:  three minutes of strength, two minutes of cardio, and one minute of abs in each workout. I've done two of the workouts so far, and they are *really* hard, just like her workouts always are.

The DVD also comes with a thirty-day diet plan you can access online.  I haven't done so yet, but will try to update my review after I have checked it out.

Before I bought my first Jillian workout, I had been worried that they would be too easy since I consider myself an advanced exerciser and thought that her workouts were more for beginners.  Boy, was I wrong!  Her workouts are intense, and she really does use the most cutting-edge methodologies in her workouts, including metabolic circuits (weights and cardio with high-intensity interval training [HIIT] intervals) and compound exercises (where you use multiple muscle groups to burn more fat).  Awhile back, I did a three-week rotation I found on Exercise TV's website called 30-Day Slimdown that uses some of her older workouts for thirty days. (Amazon won't usually let you post links in your reviews, but if you do a search with those words, you should find the rotation.) Although I didn't stick with the full thirty days since it's hard for me to just stick with one workout instructor for that long, in three weeks I saw a significant difference in my fat loss, even though I was working out less than I had been with other workout DVD's.

Although this DVD is set up where you do each workout for a week, I usually don't use her workouts that way, and I still get results.  I usually just mix and match them, either doing two thirty-minute workouts back to back or adding another workout to one of hers.

As Jillian mentions in her intro to the first workout, none of the moves are repeated in any of the workouts on this disk; however, there are moves which are repeated on her other workout DVD's (like butt kicks and skaters), which is why I gave this four stars.  I understand that it is probably really hard to come up with new moves for every single DVD she makes, but it would have been nice to have had a little more variety.

Although I don't find Jillian as fun to work out with as I do other instructors, her workouts get results as long as you are consistent with them, and I think that this one will, too!  As mentioned above, so far I have done two of the workouts and found them fun and intense, so I will update my review once I've done all four a few times.

UPDATE ON 3/5/11:  I've had a chance to download the meal plan, and it looks really good.  It's nineteen pages long, and gives some good suggestions as to meal ideas.  I also like that she is up front in it as to which companies she has a financial interest in.

UPDATE ON 3/23/11:  I've done all four workouts a few times now, and really find them tough, especially 3 and 4.  What I also like is that they are short enough to add on to another half-hour workout if I want to do a half-hour of weights before doing this.  If you like the format of this workout, you might also like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peak-10-Cardio-Strength-with-Michelle-Dozois/dp/B00474M6UW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peak 10 Cardio Strength with Michelle Dozois</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-S-A-P-Hollywood-Bootcamp-4x4/dp/B0041SPGDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.S.A.P.

All three of these other workouts are like Jillian's Ripped in 30 in that they use strength intervals (and you just need two pairs of dummbells, with no other equipment) and metabolic circuits, although each of these other workouts is about an hour long.  (I always like hearing suggestions for other workouts, so hope that other readers do, too.)",1298937600,68,5125,4.940559440559441
4328071,5,B004CRR9IS,"Jillian Michaels has a reputation for being an incredibly rough and tough trainer that will push her students to the limit, and this DVD is exactly that.  Jillian has created a workout based on her 321 system that people first saw in her ""30 Day Shred"" workout.  The 321 system is a circuit that intervals strength, cardio, and ab exercises to give you the ultimate workout.  What she does is do strength training for 3 minutes: 3 exercises done 30 seconds each then repeated.  She then does 2 minutes of cardio: 2 exercises done 30 seconds each then repeated.  She finishes off with abs: 2 exercises each done for 30 seconds.  After she has finished this first circuit, she moves onto 2 other circuits with different moves but the same structure.

There's no denying it; the workouts are tough!  There are 4 workouts on this DVD with Level 1 being the ""easiest"" (even though it is still very intense) and Level 4 being the hardest.  The plan behind the DVD is for the viewer to do each level for a week before upgrading to the next level for a week and so on.

There are usually modifications for beginners to do if a certain exercise is too tough for them, but Jillian is very firm in that these are only to be done if it is impossible for you to do the moves at their most challenging level.

Jillian is actually an excellent trainer despite her roughness.  She jokes around with her backup girls and really makes the workout fun.  She talks a lot throughout the workout, making sure you understand the technique behind each movement and what you should be working, so don't think she remains silent the entire time.  Overall, I really like her and find her snarling motivation to be effective on me.  Note that she does use some mild, coarse language in parts of the DVD.

Jillian says that you need a light and heavy set of weights, but I find using one set of heavy weights that challenge me is sufficient, so don't worry if you don't have two sets.

As an example as to the type of workouts on this DVD, I'm going to break down Level 1 (which I found very effective on my upper body, not so much on lower body or abs):

Warm Up - Jillian believes in dynamic stretches as a warm up, so the moves here are big swinging motions.  The moves included are: arm swings around in a circle, straight kicks forward with arm swings, leans forward into squats and standing up, swinging a weight around your neck, knee pull ups with squats, and more arm swings.

Strength 1 - Push-ups, squats with press up with weights, crescent pose (basically holding a forward squat) with tricep kickbacks with weights
Cardio 1 - Football feet (fast running), skaters
Abs 1 - Plank, coming up into a half crunch and holding it with feet lifted

Strength 2 - Stiff leg dead lifts (a lean forward with straight legs and weights) and upright rows with weights, squats with swings with weight, leans forward with legs spread out and weight held behind head
Cardio 2 - Running mans, punches in a squat
Abs 2 - Side planks with pulse (both sides count as two exercises)

Strength 3 - Chair pose with reverse flies (basically lifting arms to the side) with weights, side lunge with forward raise with weights, lunge forward with bicep curls with weights
Cardio 3 - Butt kicks, one leg jumps
Abs 3 - Basic crunches, reverse crunch

Cool Down - Stretches for shoulders, triceps, side, back, hamstrings, and quads.

And that's it!  Also included on the DVD are some advertisements for Jillian Michaels equipment, a 30 Day Meal Plan link to her website, subtitles, a Spanish option, and a workout recommendation.  This is definitely a workout to challenge yourself with and get in fantastic shape with.  I highly recommend it.",1298937600,33,3696,4.552193645990923
4328072,5,B004CRR9IS,"Ripped in 30 is a comprehensive 30 day diet and exercise plan that kicks butt!  The main menu has Workouts, Workout Recommendation, 30 day meal plan, English/Spanish, Subtitles on/off, and More from Jillian. There are 4 workouts.  All you need 1 set of light handweights, 1 set of heavy handweights, and a mat.  You do one workout level each week.  You start with workout 1 in week one and move to workout 2 the second week, or as soon as you are able, and so on.  There are two exercisers with Jillian in each workout.  You follow Shelly for beginner modifications and Bashira is back as an advanced modifier.  Jillian promises that you will never see the same move twice across the 4 workouts.  Unlike some of her other exercise videos, you only do each segment once.  Each segment has 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs.  She recommends working out 5-6 days/wk.  Always take one day of rest.  I downloaded the meal plan from her website, and the recipes seem pretty easy to fix.  They only contain a few ingredients.  You eat a breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner.  A sample breakfast is Cheerios and a banana.  A sample lunch is ordering a veggie delight from Subway.  A sample snack is a protein bar.  A sample dinner is Turkey kebabs.

Most of the moves here I've seen in her other videos, but she has some new moves too.  Each workout starts with dynamic stretching with moves such as arm circles, forward bends, squats, sledgehammers, and leg stretches while stabilizing.  In the body of the workouts, Jillian focuses on compound moves, or ones that work multiple muscles groups.  The moves get harder and more creative as you go through the different levels or workouts.  Level 1 focuses on building up muscles/skills so you are prepared for the other levels. Sample moves in level 1 are squats with arm presses, fast feet, skaters, and planks.  Some sample moves from level 2 are circle kicks, pendulum lunge with arm push outs and pull backs, chest press with single leg press, crescent lunge with rows, planks with leg taps or jumps, and mountain climbers.  The difference I see from level 2 to level 3 is that there are more stabilizing moves.  Some sample moves from Level 3 are s sledgehammer with a big arm rotation down and around with weight, forward fold towards one leg with the other leg stretched towards back so balancing on one leg and then bring same knee up to stretch, crab walk, and duck walk.  Those are just the warm up!  She has you do different moves with each arm like one arm palm up and other palm down.  Single leg squats with corkscrew curls (so you touch ground with hands and then bring up to chest high) while you bring leg up.  Stand tall, roll back onto ground without looking and bring up pelvis.  Pump arms while you do a split lunge.  Arm press in downward dog position.  According to Jillian week 4 is the ""mother of all workouts.""  The big change from level 3 to 4 seems that you are always in motion from one move to the other.  Sample moves are from power yoga - move from downward dog, crescent, plank, downward dog,  Military presses with static squat, dynamic Suma squats, jumping jacks with under the leg claps, Burpees with jumps,  scissor kicks, and pendulum legs for lower abs.

I like the fact that there are four 30 minute workouts on one DVD and a meal plan.  However, the meal plan may not be for everyone  I wish that were more new moves, rather than what I've seen in her previous videos.  However, those moves work for me to lose weight, and I feel that she is trying to present them in a new way with the different levels.  So I would say if you are new to Jillian Michaels this is a great DVD to start. If you don't have all of them, then this is also a great choice.  If you do have all of Jillian Michaels DVDs, and you are getting sick of her other videos, don't buy it.  However, I'm not sick of them yet!  So for me this DVD is 5 stars.",1298937600,313,3934,4.425383542538354
4328073,5,B004CRR9IS,"I got an advanced copy of this DVD from JIllian's camp so I could blog about it. Let me give a bit of history first, I LOVED 30 Day Shred, Trouble Zones, and Six Week Six Pack the best.  So, for me, this DVD is my favorite. It's done in a similar style but there are FOUR workouts that range from ""doable"" level 1 notice I did not say easy) to madness level 4. I haven't been able to do level 4 yet. I followed the DVD's instructions and spent a week on level 1. Then moved on to level 2 and literally dripped poured sweat. Now I am on level 3.  This one requires me to stop and catch my breath, but I am getting through it.  So far it's challenging, but the moves are fresh and Jillian motivates you through it. Plus, the workouts are only 25 minutes, which feels manageable to me even though they are hard core. The other great part about this DVD is that it comes with a 30 day meal plan that lives on her website (no you do not have to pay extra for it - it comes with a code so you can log in). So following the whole plan, thus far in three weeks I have lost 8lbs. Pretty happy about that!",1298419200,603,1095,3.9234234234234235
4328074,5,B004CRR9IS,"I was one of the selected members of Jillian's website to get this dvd early. There are 4 sets of workouts. Week 1, 2, 3 and 4. I have only done Week 1 and I love it so far. I have done this three times now.

I own every single Jillian dvd that she has put out and this one is surely one of the top ones. To me it is far better than 30 Day Shred. I was not fond of that one but I love this one. She does a better job of making sure your form is right. It seems to move at a faster pace. I burned more calories that I had in 30 Day Shred. So if you like the 3-2-1 system of 30 Day Shred you will like this one. If you didn't give it a shot anyway because this is a great dvd. The workout for Week 1 is approx 34 minutes with warm up and cool down. I have not watched the rest yet but my guess is they are around the same times.

Definitely worth the money!!!",1298246400,70,857,3.6021505376344085

4328077,3,B004CRR9IS,"I really enjoy the workouts and they are only 20 minutes.  Im a huge fan of the insanity and T25 workouts but had knee surgery earlier this year and it just cant take the pounding yet.  After doing these daily with proper eating I started seeing changes by about three weeks.  I only gave it three stars because Jillian doesnt motivate me one bit. When she gets tough and she tries to
push her viewers, it actually has the opposite effect on me.  The hardest part is the language. I did these workout with friends from church and was embarrassed by her butt biting and swears.  I workout with my children, all under 12, youngest now 6.  We mute her. I know this sounds harsh, but shes trying to be intense  but its really not effective for me and honestly is really annoying.  Because I like how her workouts make me feel, (they do work, if you work), I keep doing them with her muted and my own music playing.",1523232000,,910,4.311764705882353

4328083,4,B004CRR9IS,"I adore Jillian Michaels, and have nearly all of her DVDs.  This one is mixed for me, and after it being part of my standard rotation for about 6 months, I tossed it aside because it just seems to put more strain on me than the benefits warrant.  The primary reason for this seems to be the 3-2-1 approach: 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs (3 times).  Whereas most of her workouts do an AMAZING job balancing different target areas so that I can seamlessly go from one move to the next, getting a rest for muscles when they need it, this 3-2-1 approach just puts more strain.  I actually threw up while doing one of these workouts, which has never happened to me before, but the strain of the concentrated abs section after the concentrated cardio did it.  Usually her workouts are better balanced.  Even when it's solid cardio combined with abs and strength the whole way through, like in Kickbox Fastfix, I've never had this problem.

Another problem with these is that sometimes the moves are just harder to do than their benefit seems to warrant, like the ab hold into table in the second workout.  My shoulders strain in a lot of Jillian Michaels workouts, because she loves plank, but these are just kind of crazy.  And, let's be honest, any number of pilates-influenced moves would've been just as effective, if not more-so.

So, honestly, I'd give this 2 stars relative to other Jillian Michaels workouts.  But it's still a Jillian Michaels workout, which means it's effective and engaging, so 4 stars relative to all workout DVDs I've tried.

I do like this a hundred times more than her 30 Day Shred, though.  This is more refined.  Of the full body workouts, my favorites are: Extreme Shed & Shred and Beginner Shred (Workout 3).  I mean, come on, table vs. Brazilian jujitsuno brainer on the fun-o-meter.  And even though ES&S is much more fun and manageable (balanced), it's also more effective.",1520380800,,1935,4.647058823529412

Well, I'm in love with level 3 on that DVD. I wasn't that out of shape when I first started doing Jillian Michaels. I usually ran and I've done a lot of Tae Bo in the past. A friend turned me on to Jillian's workouts and I fell in love. I like her pep talks while you're working out, the moves are fun, and I get results. Results that are in all the right places.

4328111,5,B004CRR9IS,"I borrowed this from a friend a few years ago. I lost weight within the month!
I had to buy it for myself. It's been between 2 and 3 weeks; I'm seeing results once again. 25 minute sessions a day, and Ive only been doing 3 days a week!

Her secret is the 3 part circuit routine. The method is HIIT- high intensity interval training. The best and fasted way to loose weight!!!! But this!!!

A litttle warm up, 20 minute workout, a little cool down. Advanced and simplified women do the routines with her. Jillian is SO motivating and pushes you... through the TV",1502409600,10,561,4.333333333333333

I am not the first one to say this , but this dvd and Jillian's ""30 Day Shred"" totally transformed my body and my life.  I have a better body at 44 than I have ever had in my life.  Jillian Michaels is not only an outstanding fitness instructor, she is an inspirational woman.  I like her ""no BS/no excuses"" attitude in workouts and in life.  And her constant reminders that the hardest part of the workouts are the moments when your body transforms the most.  I actually find this lesson to apply in so many areas of life - especially as a parent.  Being a rock for your kids in the most difficult moments is what help your kids to learn, grow and transform the most.  I am also grateful to her for also saving me ALOT of money and time at the gym!  Love working out at home on my own schedule.  You rock Jillian!!!",1501372800,6,876,4.197604790419161

What got me up at 5am and keeps me going 5 days a week is, its 24 minutes long. You waste more time than that on FB and to be honest, it won't kill you.

If you can handle the ass whoopin', however, they are very effective. Do what she says, don't wimp out even if you are fairly sure you're about to keel over.

4328167,4,B004CRR9IS,"I have been using Jillian videos for years but preferred the elliptical as it kept my body more slim.  However after hitting my mid thirties and gaining a few disturbing pounds, I decided to exclusively use this video to see if a more total body workout helped with sliming down.  Here are my observations:

1. The exercises increase in intensity and difficulty - which they should.  It took a while, but I was able to do even the most difficult repetitions without feeling like I am dying.  If you can do Camp Gladiator, you can do Jillian and visa versa.
2. I found doing 30 minutes of Jillian was more effective than using my elliptical.  I typically used my elliptical 1 hour, 4 times a week.  I do 30 minutes of Jillian 2-3 times per week and have an overall better body for it.
3. Jillian bulked up my legs, and I hate it.  No girl wants to buy new jeans because she goes up a size, and if I keep doing Jillian that is exactly what will happen.  My body responds quickly to the Jillian style leg work and develops bigger muscles.

Conclusions - If you are looking to workout less and get total body results, this is a great video.  If your legs have a tendency to develop bulky muscle, be prepared to see your thigh muscles grow.  If anyone out there knows of a total body workout that does not increase the thighs - please let me know!",1489968000,2,1342,4.302788844621514

4328181,5,B004CRR9IS,"A series of brief, but high-intensity workouts that make you sweat in places you never knew you had. Workouts are 20 minutes long, with 3 circuits of strength, cardio, and abs. You move the entire time - the only breaks you get are when you switch from one focus area to another. The workouts are challenging, but there is nothing in them that is impossible to do. Jillian has a modified version of each workout, as well as an advanced version.

I love the workouts - they make me move, and boy do I sweat! I love that they're only 20 minutes, too; I use it as a motivational tool to tell myself that I can complete a workout in less time it takes me to watch a tv show.

Don't expect any gradual advancement in difficulty: these workouts will kick your butt, no matter what week you're on. You will move, and you will sweat. Note: you need a set of light weights to do the majority of the workouts, so be sure to have these on hand before you begin.",1484611200,19,950,4.214285714285714

I did the recommended 5-6 days a week for the first two weeks and had great progress. My abs were much stronger and I looked leaner. But week 3 was not what I expected. It's not that it's too difficult, it's more that the workouts include a lot of jumping and rolling... It would be very easy to hurt your back or knees with some of these moves since they're done so quickly. Not sure if I'm just going to continue week two or try and skip to week four...

However, I've notice that Jillian does not stretch before and after workouts very much. I've always scored highest in flexibility on my fitness assessments, but after using this for about a week or so, I started to noticed that my flexibility was decreased very much because of how stiff my muscles were.

4328217,5,B004CRR9IS,"This DVD is hard but it's worth it! I'm currently wrapping up week 4 and I'm down 5 lbs! I will say I did NOT follow the meal plan simply because none of the food appealed to me and I just didn't want to be miserable. I did, however, change my eating habits. Not as much snacks throughout the day, smaller portions, etc. I'm sure if you religiously follow the meal plan, you'll see even better results. One thing I found annoying is Jillian herself. She just says the most off the wall things such as ""I'm going to break you in half because when I finish with you, you're going to be unbreakable"". Good thing there's an option to add subtitles and mute out the sound. Another good thing, each workout comes with a ""modified version"" which was a lifesaver! I mostly did the modified because I have NEVER worked out a day in my life. And if I saw results just on the modified moves, imagine the results if you were to go full throttle! If you do start Ripped in 30, make sure to take before pics and measurements. I wish I had just to see how far I've come!",1476230400,3,1055,4.201970443349754
4328218,4,B004CRR9IS,"The workouts are effective. I definitely was sweating after each one, whether I did advanced or modified moves. I noticed improved strength and endurance after just a couple of weeks. I also lost some belly fat, thanks to this and better eating habits.

However, I felt like all four weeks worked the upper body WAY more than the lower body. I was kind of OK with that, because my legs were already stronger than my arms, but I did have to do something else to make sure I got good leg workouts in.

A couple of other quibbles: Jillian talks too much! Sometimes I wish she would just focus on the moves. She also advertises it as a 20 minute workout when it's really 30-40 when you include the warmup and cool down.

To keep from getting bored, I broke the rules and did a different workout each day. So Monday was Week 1, Tuesday was Week 2, etc. I think you still see good results if you just pick which of the four workouts you want to do that day.

Overall, I find it effective and challenging, but I still like to mix it up with other DVDs or apps to make sure I'm working all my muscle groups.",1476144000,,1099,4.219047619047619

4328220,5,B004CRR9IS,"I just finished Ripped in 30 yesterday, and I loved it!  Now for some details:

I did the DVD workout by repeating each workout for a week.  I started on Sunday and went through Saturday, taking one or two days off during the week.  I planned on one day off during the week because I read a review of a study that stated that people perform better when they take one day off per week.  I took the extra day off in week one because I got too busy and I took an extra day off in week 4 because my knee was creaking a bit and I wanted to give it a break.

Space requirements: minimal, but there is jumping so you may not want to do it on a floor above someone who is sleeping.

Equipment requirements: handweights; I used 3 and 5 pound hand weights, but I would have gone up to 8 for some things if I had owned them.  Around the beginning of week 4 I bought an exercise mat because I had previously been working out on concrete with a  carpet remnant on it and that was not enough cushioning.

Me: I was a little different than other reviewers because I didn't really want to lose any weight.  I wanted more muscle and a better body composition, since I basically quit working out a year ago when we moved - just never got back into the habit.  But my husband and I are going on a trip that will require a bit of strength and the ability to do some general physical things that I just didn't feel I had, so my real goal was to get ""in better shape,"" but I had to be sure not to get injured and ruin my trip.  We're trying to save money, so we just recently cancelled our never-used gym membership, and I'm honestly glad we did!  I love group fitness classes, but I honestly can't find the 20 minutes to drive to and from the gym and 30 minutes to have a workout.  That's over an hour when I can be done with these workouts in under 35 minutes and then take a shower in my own house.

The workouts: You can read all about the workouts in different reviews.  I thought that they were great.  I did 30-Day Shred some years ago, and I thought that Jillian described the exercises in these workouts better than she described those.  Some people have mentioned not liking to do the same workout for a week - well, I loved it!  I started off the week not able to really do everything in the workout, and by the end of the week, I was able to complete most things without any modifications and some things with the advanced modification.  I was able to move up in weights a bit, too.

My results:  Did I get Ripped in 30?  Well, kind of!  I am a total pear shape, and carry very little body fat above the level of my navel, so I can see good muscle definition developing in my arms and back and upper abs.  I asked my husband about my arms to make sure that I was not imagining things, and he agreed that they look good, with significantly more muscle showing (he had commented on my ""stick-like"" arms a couple of months ago, so I know he notices these things).  My legs... I think one reviewer said that her legs got bigger.  I didn't measure mine, so I don't know.  I still have too much fat on them to really see any muscle definition there, but their shape is definitely much better than it was.  They feel much firmer, too, and when I sit down in a chair my thighs continue to look like legs and don't look like resting bread dough.  So while I wasn't going for weight loss, and actually lost 0 lbs, I feel great about the physical changes I have seen.  For those who are looking to lose weight, I am sure that if I did not reward myself for working out with an entire month of eating whatever I felt like whenever I felt like it, I would have lost weight.  Did I get what I wanted to - in better shape for our upcoming trip? Yes!  I feel much more confident for this trip.  I am definitely stronger and more agile than I was before, with better cardiovascular endurance.  I feel ready, and still have over a week to go.

UPDATE: In spite of not working out very much over the next couple of days after I finished Ripped in 30, I actually lost two pounds just by returning to the sort of healthy way I was eating before.  I'd like to think it's my extra muscles eating up those calories before they can make it to my fat cells!",1475366400,7,4221,4.108669108669108

4328285,5,B004CRR9IS,"I never leave reviews. I'm a 32 year old mom of five kids (born very close together), so for a decade, exercise was the last thing on my mind. I had 20 pounds of excess weight and absolutely zero muscle strength. I had no motivation and was basically resigning myself to becoming a portly middle-aged woman with little energy and massive cravings. My dad was recently diagnosed diabetic and my grandmother has breast cancer and terrible arthritis, and it just dawned on me one day that if I didn't start taking care of my body, it would deteriorate. (Obviously, cancer doesn't play favorites - my point is just that disease and sickness generally tend to follow people with unhealthy lifestyles). So I got a fit friend of mine to hold me accountable to exercising and eating right and she pointed me to Jillian.

I started with the Beginner Shred and followed it every day for 30 days. It was rough. I couldn't do a single push-up and felt defeated and sluggish for about 3 weeks as I worked up my muscle strength. I also didn't see any weight loss during that time because I was building muscle mass, which would eventually help me to be more efficient at burning fat. But for the first three weeks, it basically sucked.

After enduring the first month, I graduated myself to the 30 Day Shred and stuck with that one for about 60 days (working out 5-6 times a week) until I could do all the advance moves. I really started to see the pounds drop, and was so excited to be feeling actually strong and energetic! I determined that i would not quit working out once I made my weight loss goals; this was the new Me.

Finally, I moved on to Ripped in 30, and now several months later, I still go back to this one again and again (just adding heavier weights if it's not challenging enough). Such a hard, well-balanced workout with great variety. I love the 3-2-1 system and feel like the cardio intervals really make this workout more effective than others out there I've tried. I also really appreciate Jillian's motivational voice: a great balance of both kicking my ass and encouragement to stay the course.

One year exactly from the beginning of this journey, I am 30 pounds lighter, feeling stronger and more energetic than I even did in high school (I was never a very athletic person, so this is major), and I can take on anything my kids can dish out without feeling wiped out at the end of the day. I shed the body fat slowly but steadily - roughly 1-1.5 pounds/week for 6-8 months. And because it's been in conjunction with healthy eating habits and no quick tricks, it has STAYED OFF.

My workouts now rotate between Ripped in 30, Yoga Inferno (also highly recommend), and Jillian's Shred it with Weights using a 20 pound kettlebell. I also work in a 2-3 mile run maybe once a week, and I'm amazed at how JM's workouts have made that activity almost enjoyable from the dreaded activity I hated most in my youth. I work out now 4-5 days a week and it's a non-negotiable part of my morning weekday routine. I can't say enough about this program!!!",1464998400,271,3054,4.505415162454874

I do think this workout is pretty difficult, and I don't necessarily think that the difficulty increases as the levels increase. Levels 2 thorough 4 are all pretty hard!

I am doing it 7 days a week.  I am currently on week 2 (I do each week for 7 days) and I do like the fact that even though for 7 days I am doing the same thing, I can see the difference in my strength level by the end of the week.  Each exercise gets a little easier each day.  I am on week 6 or 7 of doing her DVD's and I have lost a total of 16lbs and 10 1/2"".  I have never been one to stick to a routine for so long but Jillian's DVD's keep me coming back for more each day! I feel so much stronger, and ready to reach my goal, I am only 14 lbs away and I know if I stick with my daily workouts I will get there in no time.

4328329,5,B004CRR9IS,"All I can say is WOW!  I have several workout DVDs (some from Jillian) that I do and enjoy but was looking for another to throw into the rotation and prevent boredom.  My motivation behind working out is to take care of my body and boost feel-good endorphins, rather than for weight loss (sorry, folks, but you can eat your way through any workout caloric burn pretty easy), so I didn't follow her meal plan and therefore will just review the workouts (I stick to a diet of whole foods as much as possible).

I love Jillians 3-2-1 strength/cardio/abs system, as it allows for tons of variety within every workout and works your WHOLE body in each and every workout, preventing boredom and, I think, helping you get results far faster.  I have done her ""30 Day Shred"" series and love it, so I thought this would be a nice next step.  Boy, was it ever!  Though I was already in good shape when I started this DVD, I found even level one to be challenging (as always, she does provide modifications to make each exercise attainable for all fitness levels), and with each week I was challenged further and pushed harder than I had thought I was capable of!  I used to go to a gym 5 days a week consistently for several years, where I truly did push myself, but I never saw results like this.  Without even knowing the title of the program I was currently doing, my husband even used the term ""ripped"" to describe my appearance!!!  Awesome!

Jillian, I can't wait to see what you come out with next - you can bet if it's in a 3-2-1, 30 minute format, I *will* be buying it!",1460592000,9,1568,4.357388316151202

The workouts follow a 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of Abs.  The structure is easy to follow,  There were two levels that could be followed: beginner and advanced.  I workout 5-7 days a week and include strength training in my workout and the ""beginner"" seemed more intermediate than ""beginner"".  If I was first starting an exercise routine, I would feel very discouraged by how hard some of the exercises are! I saw results, but was quite bored by the repetition of Jillian speaking.

4328350,3,B004CRR9IS,"I have worked out with many other videos in the past.  From Reebok step aerobics, Tae-bo, Yoga booty ballet & Kathy Smith.  This was my first Jillian workout and it was a toughie.  Having twins 4 years ago I finally decided to work out again and I picked Jillian to do it...  wowza.  Although I am fairly active (I live on a farm) i know I am out of shape.
I think this will be great once i am in a bit better exercising shape but until get better at squats I feel unsafe to proceed with this as my first workout video getting back into it.  She moves too quick in between exercises without giving notice as to whats coming up next and when you only have a week till next level i want to be efficient and not watching whats happening next as its already hapening.  For the amount of squats, I don't feel that there is sufficient recommendations on how to properly execute them for a beginner who is just getting into exercise- compared to other dvds i watch where they really repeat how to properly perform the squats or lunges.  Again this is fine if you already know how to do these.
I would also like to know what weights she recommends starting with/what she's using.
Maybe because I am focusing on what I am doing I would like if she counted the reps a bit as I don't know how many I am doing/or If i am keeping up as somehow I am not always looking at the tv.
I was a little surprised at the cool down how short and basic it is.  But i get it- to keep it as fat burning in the given time most focus is placed on the actual workout.  i think an additional cool down option would be great that if people have time to do it they can.  I am not flexible and love to follow along with a 6 minute stretch out of all of the muscles.
In conclusion, I am sure once i get back into the motions of exercise this will be a great dvd.  I can see the effectiveness of doing this type of workout.  I might switch back to Kathy Smith for 2 weeks just to get my squats back in form properly.  Jillian says you don't have to be perfect at what we are doing but it'd help to be a bit better.",1456963200,,2078,4.012135922330097

In week 1, she asks one of the women to speak into a microphone that she has clipped on her sports bra between her breasts, sticking her chest in the woman's face.  In week 2, she growls and pretends to bite another woman's butt.  Very inappropriate and totally turned me off of wanting to watch the last 2 weeks.  I quickly bought another workout DVD by another company that is so much more professional, including a much better explanation of proper form, and a better workout as well.

4328363,5,B004CRR9IS,"This is great DVD.  I am a long time distance runner and I needed a break from running to recuperate from some nagging injuries.  I figured some cross training would help plus I couldn't' stand being lazy, so I looked around for a DVD that would challenge me and finally settled on this DVD.
The DVD is divided into 4 workouts that progressively get harder.  Jillian instructs you to do each workout for one week (5-6 times) before moving on to the next week.
So, week 1, I found myself sore in the inner thighs and arms.  I fully expected to be hurting in the arms as I never lift weights, but was surprised my legs were killing me as well.
As the weeks progressed, my soreness abated, but I would still find myself challenged with each new exercise every week.
I liked that I didn't have to do the same workout for 4 weeks in a row.  By the time I was sick of doing the same workout, it was time to move on to the next week.  Each exercise is only 30 minutes long, which is totally do-able.  She employs a 3-2-1 method for each circuit (3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio,  1 minute abs).

Jillian Michaels' workouts are wonderful workouts and last an appropriate amount of time. However, her motivation style does not work for me. I feel like she is yelling at me, or shaming me if I need to modify something her 300-400lb clients can do without modification. Her intensity comes off as forced to me, and I can't get past feeling ""less than"" when I work out ""with"" her.
As I mentioned, the physical moves she does are great, effective moves. The 3-2-1 routine is a great routine. Everything about this program is effective in losing weight and building muscle.

I like it mainly because it's very challenging while still being doable for beginners/people very out of shape. This is something that isn't easy to find. I've done T25 and Insanity, and have purchased Kayla Itsines Bikini Body Guide, and while those are also great programs, I find them impossible, and worse, discouraging and hard on the knees, if I haven't been working out for a while already.
Jillian kicks your butt, works your whole body, in a short amount of time, and it's doable for beginners and can be modified to be extra challenging or easier for the level of the user. Her 30DS is similar (I've done both and like both).
You will be pouring sweat 5 minutes in. When I was following the program and eating right last year, I toned up considerably. My arms have always been flabby and chubby, and for the first time in my life they looked slim, toned, and good in sleeveless shirts/dresses.
If you eat correctly and follow any weights/cardio program, you'll get results, but I think Jillian's is a great combination of affordability, easy to do at home, short in duration, accessible to beginners, and effective.",1447027200,15,1403,4.63855421686747

With only 7 pounds of weight loss and the huge changes in my body, I know that my body fat number is down and muscle mass is up!  That's a huge win for me!  Every single time I do this video, I have sweat running into my eyes and down my face.  Once a week I change it up and do Jillian's Yoga Inferno DVD which is also awesome!

I am often doing the modified version, so I like that I can aspire to the harder ones eventually. I see a big difference in my legs and but and best off all I am not bored, it's fun, and Jillian is very motivating.

My husband started doing them with me everyday because he saw how much of a beast i was becoming and getting all hot and fit.... He lost about 30 lbs in the last 3 months doing them with me he uses 15 lb weights to do the workouts.  These workouts are 20 mins and i am in better shape than pretty much all of my friends that pay for a gym membership and spend a hr plus there 3 times a week.  Yes they are hard, you will sweat, you will burn, you will curse her name the next day but you will lose weight, you will get fit and you will ultimately be able to order a size small Brazilian cut bikini if you want to.  You will actually need to do it 5 times a week when you start, but really just tell yourself to do it.

I gave this three stars because she dies motivate you to lose and as I stated before, you have the potential to burn calories. For me, there are more enjoyable and exciting ways to burn the calories...",1436572800,4,499,4.555555555555555

4328465,4,B004CRR9IS,"This is a really great DVD for getting some toning in but if you are looking to drop LBS you may, like me, have difficulty. I am currently 5'4.5 127 lbs. after gaining from 120 to 140 last year I am coming closer to my goal weight (ideally 110 but ok with anything between 110 and 120 ish) I have used this periodically for several years. I pulled this out in desperation after hitting a plateua from dieting anf having took a lazy 8 months off any workouts after four years of regular training.  I own many Jillian DVD's and I think she is a great trainer.  I only lost like three pounds doing her workouts for 5 weeks.  I find with this and the shred you have to add CARDIO or you will find yourself staying at the same weight.  Don't buy into gaining muscle/losing fat because gaining a pound of muscle does not happen in a week or two. I have noticed positive changes in my body while rotating jillians workouts most recently.
 as far as the workouts:
Level 1 is very reasonable for a beginner.  I think it is well rounded.  The first circuit is hardest.  I use a 10 lb kettlebell for the squat swings. and sometimes do the 2nd circuit twice. good mornings are too easy.  The ab work is insufficient for me also.  i like to add some 'blogilates' to make up for it. My calves were very sore the day after this.
level 2 is a b@$%h.  Even when I was in top form I couldn't do the entire first cardio circuit. Best I get is three out of four.  So I sub some regular jacks or standing mountain climbers.  I also use only one 5 lb weight for sumo/tricep ext I cant keep good form with two 3 lbs. this level is very core centered & I feel like a accomplished something by the end.
Level 3 is also tough, I do not hate as much as level 2.  Some moves were akward for me- the side push up thing especially.
level 4 is the most well rounded of all four weeks IMO I think it's close to a perfect Jillian HIIT  workout.

All in all I would recommend, I like better than shred for a few reasons.  One it came out after so I assume Jillian has learned a few things/improved on things since her 30 day shred release.  Also I like the addition of a 3rd strength move, which however, is inexplicably missing from week 3 circuit 1 ( this kills me, how many people looked at this before it hit shelves? and if they knew they should have found a way to fix it.) I always pause and do the missing part on my own. With most Jillian workouts I find myself pausing/rewinding during strength because I do not want to sacrifice form or reps because of the fast paced transitions (main reason I give 4 stars), but for me doing the moves properly is key.  This would be my pick for anyone wanting to buy their first Jillian dvd.  Yes her flirting can be obnoxious, but after the first few days i just play my music and use the subtitles just in case.",1436572800,6,2826,4.15045871559633

I did one of your videos the other day and it was way too easy, almost like laying in bed and reading a book!

Plan was to go to the gym and hop on a treadmill after but mostly just do some interval training. The 2 mins cardio really was hard and I run 20 mins 3 days a week. I know I need more cardio and more strength training tho. Sorry but 9 mins strength training a day and 6 mins cardio just won't be enough for me. If u r starting to workout or don't go to a gym or anything then this may or may not be good for u. The moves in the first video r fairly basic so a beginner can do this video.... I won't say it won't be hard... bc it will. And u may or may not be able to finish without taking a break. But push urself thru it and no matter what keep moving! Keep proper form so u don't injure urself and if that means taking it slower than the modified version then do it but keep moving. It really helps me to know how much time is left in each of the 3 2 1 parts bc I can tell myself... ""only 45 more seconds you can do it!"" But that's just me.

4328473,5,B004CRR9IS,"Ok, maybe that title of the review is a little dramatic, but I owe a lot of my weight loss success to this DVD and it's attached meal plan.

I picked up the DVD a few years ago, did week one a few times and put it away.  I was pretty heavy and it was hard to keep up, just like all of Jillian's other DVDs.  It left me feeling kind of defeated.

I noticed that Jillian had a free meal plan online.  In September of 2014, I went through the snacks and decided it was something I could do.  I decided to limit my calories to 1200-1500 a day, work out six times a week and see what happened.  I ate the snacks she listed in her diet plan and later picked up the breakfasts as well while eating something light for lunch and dinner.

Eighty-five pounds later, here I am!

The diet really does work and Jillian does a great job of making sure that these are meals that can be grabbed on the go or made easily.  I rarely feel deprived--and I still eat the snacks and breakfasts--and I continue to have success!

But enough about this meal plan, let me talk about the actual work outs themselves.  I did each week for two weeks and have returned to try some of the earlier weeks.  What I am really enjoying is that I feel challenged by all four work outs.  It's not like week one is SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY and week four is SO IMPOSSIBLE.  They all have their challenges and their easier moments (though that week four is tough, I won't lie!)  The girls who help Jillian in this DVD I think are exceptionally good--Shelley, Natalie and Basheera are all personable, ok with being human and showing a little struggle but ultimately keep very good form.  This is an improvement off of Natalie in some of Jillian's other work outs.  Jillian is intense, focused and inspiring.  I kind of like her goofiness in other DVDs, but she seemed much more focused in this one.  I also kind of like her sadistic side in week four--at one point, she shouts ""awww, are you gonna cry--does it hurt?  I DON'T CARE.""  That had me wiping sweat off my face and snarling a few choice words at her.

The criticisms I have of this DVD are consistent with her other DVDs--and may not be true for everyone.  I for one struggle with upper body strength.  Plank is A LOT for me.  I always think it's too much for her to expect beginners to be able to achieve military push ups in week one.  I also think that that first circuit of cardio in week two is WAY TOO HARD (plank the entire time), but hey, do I make it through it every time?  Yes, so I guess what doesn't kill you... Sometimes I wish Jillian spent a little more time on form, but overall, she has some good pointers and rarely do I see the girls rush through their exercises in a way that concerns me (I'm looking at you, Bob Harper).

I am not saying that I am perfect at these workouts--a lot of the time have to modify, but I get a great work out of them every time I do them!  I have noticed large improvements in my legs, my arms and my shoulders with some nice stuff happening in my abs too.  This is NOT A BEGINNER WORK OUT (not achievable for me when I was 85 pounds heavier), but it is a great work out for someone who is an intermediate excerciser.  THANK YOU JILLIAN!  YOU HAVE DONE ME A WORLD OF GOOD!",1435708800,6,3235,4.174474959612278

A few things I like that she mentions here, first off I might just stick to level one for a while mix it up with six week six pack abs. personal note aside it's good to mix up the work outs.

I like the fact that she takes the time to get the form down in level one, don't be afraid to pause it and take longer or just watch it first off then do it at a later date. it's better to get the form down then to go all crazy and become injured.

I'm a big girl, however I have noted that with Jillian I have shed inches like nuts. Weight has stayed around the same, but the dress size has dropped in about two months.

Be pashient with yourself and go slower if you need to as with any workout.
I like Julian because of her energy and her kick in the rear tude she has and you really can do this if you take the time and effort to perhaps modify if you need to, etc.

the real goal in any activity is to become a you 2.0 I hate working out, but if I'm going to do it I'd rather it be 30 minutes of good form and a good sweat then 20 of bad form and aching paying for it later not in a good way.

4328518,5,B004CRR9IS,"I love Jillian Michaels because her DVD's are a workout.  They aren't just some silly little video with empty promises.  They are hard core.

I started week one, and just did 12 minutes the first time.  When the soreness wore off, 3 days later, I did 25 minutes.  Again, 3 days of soreness and finally I was able to do the full workout to week one.  Now, I am able to do it, without the horrible soreness.

This video is broken up into 4 weeks.  Each week gets harder, but she doesn't repeat the exercises.  She combines cardio, weights and strength training.  My hair is dripping with sweat when I am done with the 30 minute exercise.  I love it!

4328520,5,B004CRR9IS,I was hesitant to workout with Jillian Michaels. All her reviews usually say they are not good on the ankles or knees and my knees are bad. But she has great modifications. I have been using Jackie warner for a while I have all her dvds. I cant say who is better but I really gotta say I feel great after this workout. Very inspiring sort of annoying but damn does she get the job done! Just finished week 1 can't wait for the other weeks. I did check to make sure they worked and they do. Best $9 spent ever!

I have 2 things to say about this 1) if you haven't worked out in years and are very out of shape,  take it slow,  slow slow!  Follow the modified version! Don't overdo it; even if jillian is screaming at you to push,  stop if you must! 2) this also applies for those already moderately in shape (myself). Don't think you can hardcore kill the workouts without potential injury.  Yes, I experienced sciatica during week two...so I took SEVERAL DAYS OFF and went back in easy. It's s great video! I'm 30 years old, moderately in shape, and have seen a HUGE difference in my strength AND stamina. after doing week 1 for the first time I was sore for two days but now that I'm at week too, I don't even feel the slightest bit sore and I'm totally ready for week 3. give it a try!

4328552,5,B004CRR9IS,"For context, I am over 40 and have always been thin.  I've have done other kinds of exercise, including cycling indoors and out and P90X.  After having two kids, I was skinny-fat with a growing muffin top.  I had never done a Jillian Michaels video before.  I was looking for a good workout in 20 minutes.  I wasn't expecting much for 20 minutes.  I just wanted to get some exercise in.  This is by far the most effective work out I've ever done, even more effective than the 1 hour P90X workouts.  Within one month, I had a six pack for the first time in my life!!  I have continued with this work out for over 1.5 years and I am more fit now than when I was in my 20's and cycling.  This work out goes quickly because each exercise lasts for 30 seconds.  So, if something is really hard, just keep trying because it will stop in less than 30 seconds.  The first workout is really for beginners, but still fun and not easy.  The rest still kick my butt!  I've gone on to buy other Jillian workouts, my favorites being 6 week 6 pack and shred it with weights.  As you get more fit, you can make the workout harder by doing the advanced version and increasing your weights.  Highly recommend this if you don't have much time and want to get fit.

Update:
Did my workout this morning and had to come back to say what about this workout makes it so great and why it is responsible for me being more fit.  There is no wasted time.  The moves are almost all combination moves.  So, you aren't just doing reverse fly, you are doing reverse fly while holding chair pose.you aren't just doing bicep curls, you are doing bicep curls while doing lunges.  The cardio intervals keep your heart rate up.  In week 2, one of the 2 minute cardio intervals is all in plank, so you are holding plank for 2 minutes while doing plank jacks and mountain climbers!  What do I mean by more fit?  I have more cardio endurance.  I have sculpted abs and arms.  My legs are solid and my bottom has actually lifted, something no other workout has done for me.  I have more flexibility and better balance.  Most importantly, you can stick with this workout because it is only 20 minutes.  It is hard to find excuses when you only need 20 minutes.",1425168000,59,2217,4.28743961352657

4328554,4,B004CRR9IS,"This DVD is worth the money.  You get four workouts and I use it to change things up a bit.  The workouts are a good mix of strength, cardio and flexibility.  I give it four (not five stars) for a few reasons probably purely personal. 1) There's no countdown timer.  It's easier to keep going if you know how much time is left. 2) The workouts seem like a random amount of time.  Although she says 20 minutes it's more like 30 (ish). Of course, you can always stop when you want but then you're left feeling like a quitter. 3) She can leave out the life lessons and lectures and just keep it to working out. Other than that I think they're great.",1425168000,2,646,4.17741935483871

4328568,5,B004CRR9IS,"I'm only on week 2 (moving up to week 3 this week!) but so far I love this DVD! I was in pretty good shape when I started this program, but the workouts are challenging and I'm already seeing better definition in my arms and legs, and my abs are becoming more noticeable. Jillian kind of scares me and she is kicking my butt...but in a good way!

I had been doing the Turbojam workouts and running for a while before getting this DVD...and I still like doing those things, but I like that the circuit training workouts are less repetitive. You never have to do any particular exercise for longer than 1 minute total in each workout (though it might be split into two 30-second sets) and the mix of strength, cardio and abs ensures that you work your whole body. (Rather than say, Turbojam, which splits cardio, abs and strength into different workouts.) I also like that almost every exercise combines multiple body parts.

I will say that some of the exercises have been hard for me (pushups, planks, table transitions) because I have carpal tunnel syndrome in one wrist. I modify the exercises by doing pushups on my knees if I need to, planking on a chair, and supporting my body on my fists rather than flat palms so that my wrists stay straight. It's still doable and it hasn't stopped me from completing the workouts, but keep that in mind if you have bad wrists and maybe figure out what alternatives are going to work for you ahead of time.",1424131200,2,1448,4.481060606060606

I've lost interest and am searching for another program that I'll look forward to.  I realized when I was finding reasons to skip her video to do other things that it was time to move on.  That said, part of my boredom was doing the same bloody video every day, someone suggested mixing them up and I so wish I had read that earlier.

There are way too many moves that involve planks for my taste - my wrists hurt in the second workout about as much as the muscles being worked.  Ms. Michaels makes a bunch of ridiculous comments during the workouts that I find annoying and not funny.  For example, she makes several bounce-a-quarter-off-your-butt statements to her helper, a comment about wanting to just take out bite out of aforementioned butt, and something about how the fat kid always hates the cheerleader.  Why would anyone possibly think those comments would keep me motivated?

4328624,5,B004CRR9IS,"Like other reviewers have said, Jillian really brings her A game to this video. It's like the 30 Day Shred on steroids. I completed the 30 Day Shred 30 day challenge which was made even more difficult for me since I hadn't worked out in a freaking year. I started that in mid October 2014. I felt like a lion after making it through the 30 days. Yes, I about died in the beginning. I was sore in places I didn't know I could be sore in, especially my butt of all places! But after all of that, I was super strong in the end. I could see muscles where I hadn't seen them before, my poor butt made it through lifted and toned and smaller, but not flat which was nice. So anyways, I'm digressing as this is a review for RI30. I said all that to say that I wanted to keep going with my fitness after doing the Shred challenge. Feeling stronger, waking up with pep in my step, and just feeling more healthy motivated me to move on to RI30. RI30 is definitely tweaked from the Shred. Jillian is always insane, but some parts of this one I thought, geez, she enjoys being sadistic while getting someone in insane shape! Don't get me wrong. I know Jillian has a good heart, but when it comes to getting down to business she will not sugarcoat anything. I'm even stronger now that I've done all 4 levels of RI30. I started off doing another 30 day challenge, but got discouraged because I was working out daily, seeing muscles underneath, but my belly fat was still there taunting me! I completed 17 days of the RI30 challenge and was on level 3 when I started getting frustrated and bored with working out so hard, but not seeing the results I wanted. I was determined not to lose everything I'd worked for though so I switched it up and started doing RI30 every other day while incorporating Lindsay Brin's Moms Into Fitness dvd. Hers is interval training which is effective. Brin also has a 12 week schedule on her dvd with workouts. With RI30, I did level 3 about 5 days because it was really heavy on shoulder work and I slept on my neck wrong one night so it was just too painful to continue that particular workout. So now I'm on to level 4. Jillian calls it the mother of all workouts and it sure is! This is where the thought 'This lady is insane,' repeatedly plays in my head. I'm usually dripping sweat at the end, but it's awesome that I can do all of the exercises strongly and keep up! Another big change I made with doing her workouts every other day is to start a food delivery service with Diet to Go. I had been cooking healthy meals, but I think I was ingesting too many calories. I couldn't figure out a way to get the calorie count down so I figured I could try the meal delivery. So far that has been amazing! I LOVE this company so far and the food is out of this world. I'm doing the low carb plan since I normally try to eat Paleo/Primal, but they have traditional and vegetarian plans too. I just started it 3 days ago and I can tell I'm dropping some of the fat. Now I see what my food portions need to look like, but honestly, I'm too lazy and get too overwhelmed with cooking and calculating everything food-wise. So now I feel more motivated to see this thing through. I feel like my exercise will be effective with my diet under control. It's awesome! If I can remember I'll update this review with my weight loss, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to do that as I know these things take time. Right now I'm at 157 which I know is due to my increased muscle mass. Hopefully, I'll be able to get rid of my stubborn belly fat and that number will go down. Really I don't care what the number is as long as I can see my muscles every where and no unnecessary fat. So here are just a few of my thoughts about the RI30 levels:
Level 1- I like this one a lot. It's straight forward. The only thing I hate are the side lunges with weights. The move just feels awkward to me.

Level 2- This one is okay. I always lose my balance on the pendulum lunges. The plank jacks, then mountain climbers right after are murder! I hate the 2nd strength set with the ab hold, crow push ups, and sit ups where you crawl up your leg (again an awkward move IMO). She goes a little crazy with the high knees at the end. Sometimes I do all of them and then other times I'm like whatever Jillian and stop after I've had enough.

Level 3-This one again is okay. It has a lot of shoulder work which I just couldn't do after sleeping on my neck wrong.

Level 4- I like this one a lot. Jillian is a sadistic nut on this one, but I like pretty much all of the moves except the chataranga (sp) push ups. I have a pinched nerve in my elbow and always feel this one in my right pinky.

That's all for now. Hopefully, this review is helpful to someone.",1419120000,7,4739,4.164667393675027

4328633,5,B004CRR9IS,"Im noticing toning and strength in my biceps, triceps, shoulders and thighs on this program.  The program has four 30 minute workouts with warm up/cool down and is meant to be completed in four weeks.  Each workout has three circuits.  Each circuit has 3 minutes of strength training (three moves repeated twice), 2 minutes of cardio (two cardio moves repeated twice) and 1 minute of abs (typically two moves for 30 seconds each).  This format makes the workouts go by fast.  Most days it seems like Im half way through the workout before I know it.  The workouts are progressively more difficult as the weeks go on.  Jillian usually includes modifiers to make the moves easier or more challenging depending on your fitness level.  She keeps the workouts moving along and you will have moments of heart pumping action and recovery.  I was surprised that Jillian included a short, guided meditation at the end of Workout 4, which was really nice and sent a beautiful message about caring for yourself and living your life with intention.  You can skip it and go straight to stretching, but I do recommend that you listen to it at least once.

I enjoyed the workouts for Week 1, 2 and 4 (youll notice I omitted Week 3, which sucks).  Workouts for Weeks 1 and 2 are somewhat challenging, but not killer.  I think they are fine for a beginner, if you use the modifiers.  Youll build balance and strength to prepare you for the pain to come.  For Week 3, circuit 1 and 3 are terrible, awful, painful.  By painful, I don't mean injury, I mean muscle fatigue/pain of the highest order while executing the moves.  Week 3 primarily uses your body weight instead of hand weights for strength training, which I always find more difficult.  Initially, I felt like I did not get a good workout with this one because I could not keep up with the reps on the body weight moves.  However, on the fourth time doing the Week 3 workout, I had a breakthrough and was able to do more reps, so some progress was made.  For me, Week 3 is harder than the workout for Week 4, which I found challenging but fun for the most part.

Although this is supposed to be a four week program, I modified the duration and schedule of the program because 1) I needed a six week long cycle to get to my next off week and 2) I absolutely cant do the same workout 4 or 5 days in one week, as prescribed (I get bored easily and I want to quit).  My workout cycle is to do two of the workouts (WO) on alternating days twice a week, plus two other cardio sessions (not included in the Ripped in 30 program).  My cardio is also about 30 minutes long.  I sometimes combine a cardio day with the Ripped workout, so I can be off on both Saturday and Sunday.  However, I always do the Ripped workout first, then the cardio. My schedule looks like this:
Weeks 1-3: WO1; WO2; Cardio Day; WO1; WO2; Cardio Day; Day Off
Weeks 4-6: WO3; WO4; Cardio Day; WO3; WO4; Cardio Day; Day Off
Im going into week 6 now, and I see more definition in my arms and shoulders.  Not sure if I dropped weight (Im not into the scale, I just go with how I feel).  I definitely feel stronger and a little tougher after this workout.",1418342400,,3159,4.373927958833619

For a non-American, Jillian's in-your-face attitude and motivational speeches take a bit of getting used to, but it's definitely worth it.

The part where she does side lunges I can't do because I get a sharp pain in my vagina when I open my legs that way. I believe its because of vaginal birth my vagina has been easily pained. And also working the side abs or obliques that part is too hard to lift your body in that way I think she should find another way for beginners to exercise that area. I heard a lot of ppl talk about 30day shred so that one may be a better buy. And when you are beginner push ups past 3 or pretty much impossible and it may be like 15 she has them doing I usually get at the most five done and skip that part. I wish these trainers would understand beginner means exactly that. I'm not string enough to as many reps as she can do.

4328654,5,B004CRR9IS,"I've used Jillian DVDs in the past but I never stuck to one like this. The 4 weeks seemed pretty attainable and it was! Before, I rarely worked out and I sit in an office all day so I didn't have a lot of stamina. I did the modified versions for most of the workouts but tried the advanced when I could. I also didn't use weights until week 3. I also didn't stick to the meal plan (which isn't necessary) because they will ask for a credit card. Because of these factors, my results weren't as dramatic as most that used more weights and stuck to the meal plan. However, I was very happy with the results I did get. I started seeing abs and muscles I didn't know I had. I just finished the 30 days last night and I plan on starting it again soon.",1415318400,,746,4.047297297297297

I tried to use it the was you are suppose to which is in a one month interval but I found that I was getting tired of same moves for an entire week and became less motivated to workout after work each day.  What I started to do was pepper in these workouts with some of my other workouts and that is what works for me.  I like that weeks 3 and 4 are difficult and offer a challenge when I really want one.  But I also like that weeks 1 and 2 are easier but I still feel the burn in my muscles the day after.  Mixing this with my cardio, yoga and Pilates has really made my workouts effective.

4328665,5,B004CRR9IS,"Ok! So I've recently joined Jillian fan club. Oh who am I kidding. I've always loved her no non-sense training methods. This is just my first time using her DVDs at home. for reference, I am by no means athletic. I have had three surgeries in the past 15 months. I have a Trainer once a week. And I work with a physical therapist to keep from injuring myself.

I read all the reviews. The ones saying they were injured must be doing something wrong. Ripped in 30 is an extremely effective workout DVD. I am alternating it with Killer Buns and Thighs. I do one work out from each DVD a day, but I do them back to back. So for example: Level 1 of Ripped followed by Level 1 of Killer B&T.  Ripped workouts are approx 25 mins long not counting the cool down and warm ups. Killer B&T workouts are a little longer, but since I only do one warm up and one cool down, it comes out to approx 55 mins of solid heart pounding, sweat dripping work.

Jillian is much less annoying in Ripped. She sticks to her true self and doesn't try to be cutesy. In Killer B&T she is trying too hard to be a BFF. I need my Jillian to focus/help me stay focused on form. That's exactly what I get in Ripped!

I am loving this so far. It feels effective. My muscles are joyously confused/engaged and I feel it working! I will continue to do two a day resting in between days if needed for the foreseeable future. I'm thinking more along the lines of 6 to 7 weeks rather than 30 days.

Give it a try. Push yourself, but don't force it. Skip certain things in the DVD if it feels jarring. I don't do any impact circuits. If it hurt stop. That's what my PT always says. Keep the workout in your muscles and not your joints.",1412985600,2,1693,4.133738601823708

4328669,5,B004CRR9IS,"Great workouts, though I liked Jillian's attitude much more in her Killer Abs video, when her conversation was far more positive and humble. The dialogue gets a bit tiring in RI30, but it's still a super workout program.",1412121600,,220,4.815789473684211

I actually bought a granny bathing suit to wear swimming to cover up the muffin top. I prefer my bikini. So time for a change. I bought the DVD and some weights, and got to work. First week, is slow but needed to get you ready for week 3 and 4. Week 1 teaches the basic stances.  I do not like week 2. I do not have weak wrists but week 2 is hard on my wrists.

A friend of mine and I are doing this together, but instead of doing only this dvd for each week, we actually switch it off with other dvd's.

Still the results are great.",1407801600,,330,4.593220338983051
4328699,5,B004CRR9IS,"Absolutely Love this workout. Let me first start by saying that I decided to write this review assist others in making their decision, as I am one who usually reads reviews before trying. I use to hate JM's style of bully training, so I stayed away from her workout dvds. I must also admit that I also stayed away from them because when I reviewed them on youtube they seemed too tough.  I am a 36 year old mom with four kids at 188 pounds.

Anyway by the end of May 2014 I took a real hard look at myself in the mirror...and I did not like what I saw. That was the moment that I decided to do something about it. So I made up my mind to start a new fitness journey. Low and behold, by some act of God I guess I was magically drawn to JMs Shred in 30 days video (In the past i'd done Billy Blanks, Leslie Sansone and Jari Love).

I dedicated myself to doing 30DS; however I did not go the straight 10 days because my right knee gives me problems so I took breaks in between. After the 30DS I lost 1 pound and 5-6 inches. It may not seem alot, but I was happy with that because one of those inches were lost of hips, which i found in the past very hard to lose.

After 30DS I started ripped in 30. I did each work out five days per week, breaks in between. After level 1 and 2 I'd lost 3 inches and 3 pounds. Again very happy because I had lost another stubborn inch off my hips. To date I have completed level three and is 3 days away from completing level 4.

I am totally inlove with JM's videos!! I will be doing Body revolution once I've completed ripped in 30. I must add that I do not follow her meal plans because I want this to be a way of living for me so I know that I would not be able to follow that plan. I still eat mostly every, I mainly watch my carb intake alternating between high and low carb days. I've found that carbs reallly bloat me.

For those of you who have knee issues as I do. I would recommend wearing a knee brace while exercising. I found that this has helped me tremendously. I also bought a back brace, because I'd notice that after some exercises I would experience a little back discomfort. The back brace as fixed that problem, I also wear the brace while I exercise. I have taken all precautionary measures to ensure that I am able to continue with JMs dvds, BECAUSE I AM GETTING REAL RESULTS.

My friends and family have noticed that I have lost weight and my 11 year old daughter told me the other day that I am getting skinny. Not that I want to get skinny because I enjoy being curvy. I only want to get more toned and lose some inches.....just not too much. I should also mention that for years I had loose skin from having four children, I was not able to see my private part for many years because of the loose skin, after 30DS I am now able to see it fully!!!

Alot of people find her annoying....I use to until I started the dvds, now i enjoy hearing her say...""push, push, push"" ""Why? because you can"". I find JM very motivating and I thank God for finally building up the nerve to try her dvds.

IF IN DOUBT JUST TRY IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Sometimes I do not feel llike exercising but I push myself, becuase I know that if i stop now I will go back to the way i use to be and I don't want that!!.

I typically just worked out with cardio and wanted to start some strength training. Jullian had my heart rate through the roof and I had sweat dripping off of me. But it worked. In the first week I noticed a difference in my arms and my stomach. By the end of four weeks I had lost about 4 pounds that had been pretty stubborn. I didn't follow her diet plan but watched what I ate on my own. This is the only work out I did. It was a little tough on the knees in week 3 though. I just did the modified versions if I felt achy.

I do see some improved muscle tone all over as well as a decrease in belly fat.  The cons are doing the same workout 5 or 6 days as recommended gets very boring.  Also if you have any knee problems (I have been a runner for years and done some damage to the cartilage in my knees) this will be a difficult if not impossible workout for you.  There are a lot of squats and jumping and I wasn't able to do as many days as I wanted of the workouts due to the high impact exercises.  I did 5 days a week of the first two weeks and had to cut back to 4 days a week on the last two weeks.

4328728,3,B004CRR9IS,"I can do level 1 of 30 day shred, so got this for variety. At 76 it's too hard for me so I gave it to my daughter in law.",1404345600,2,121,3.066666666666667
4328729,5,B004CRR9IS,This is a great DVD to help you get in shape.  Jillian has a style that either you like or don't.  She definitely makes you work during the time on the program.  And it helps to get you results.,1404259200,,194,3.923076923076923
4328730,5,B004CRR9IS,"I've only done weeks 1,2, and some of 3.  I stopped using it for a while because I had purchased a few of her other DVDS. I love Jillian. I think she is funny, fair and real. This DVD is great if you don't have an entire hour to devote to working out. Or sometimes if I do I'll combine 2 workouts. I won't lie though, I have yet to get to workouts 3 & 4, but now that I have been exercising for a year and a half, I will try them out, more to come!",1404259200,,448,3.618556701030928
8423470,1,B004CRR9IS,"I really wanted to like this. I powered through the entire first week and got about halfway through the second week before I just couldn't motivate myself to keep doing it. As others have said, Jillian Michaels is insanely annoying. She will stand there and say that 400 pound people can do these workouts meanwhile the girls behind her (who are totally ripped) are struggling through them. This is NOT for beginners. I managed to make it through the first week but during the second week, she expects you to be able to hold a plank pose for nearly 3 minutes. That was completely impossible for me. Many of the workouts were hard on my knees and my back (and I'm only 33 and not overweight). I was incredibly annoyed with not having any sort of timer to count down the exercises. This probably had to do with the fact that Jillian Michaels clearly can't tell time. She claims it is a 3-2-1 thing but it is more like 5-3.5-2 (I used a stopwatch and clocked it). She offers NO breaks through the whole thing (just asking for injury!). Overall, even with me pausing it for a water break after every circuit, I could barely keep up or do the exercises (there is virtually no instruction on how to do them so I spent way too long trying to figure it out). I tried, but this was a bad purchase. On top of that, I bought it on instant video and there is no separation of exercises so I had to rewind and fast forward constantly. Annoying! Save yourself the time and money and find something better.",1528934400,,1491,4.386281588447654

8423472,5,B004CRR9IS,This video is really good if your trying to get back in shape. I was starting to see results and eating right at the same time untill I got pregnant and had to stop,1528588800,,164,3.8529411764705883

8423474,3,B004CRR9IS,ok,1527465600,,2,2.0
8423475,5,B004CRR9IS,"Love it. Kicks my butt but the moves are simple enough for anyone to do or modify for their skill level. I'm new to the exercise scene and this is me 30 days in. I don't keep track of my weight but am fitting in clothes I haven't worn in forever. My mommy-pouch totally changed! I'm a mommy of two and am loving my results, have even had people ask me what I'm doing. Jillian knows her stuff and makes 30 minutes really count. Starting month 2 and looking into her other dvds to keep things new and fresh. Her dvds are going to be my routine!",1526169600,,542,4.074766355140187
8423476,5,B004CRR9IS,Definitely works for me! I'm two months postpartum and I only struggled a little lol. I can't wait to see my strength increase within the next couple weeks.,1524355200,,156,4.607142857142857
8423477,2,B004CRR9IS,I loved 30 day shred. I got a bit bored but saw great results. When I finished it I thought I would move on to RI30. I couldn't get past week 2. I hated the exercises. Jillian seemed mean. I'm going to try some Tracy Anderson or simply go back to 30 day shred.,1524355200,,260,3.8333333333333335
8423478,5,B004CRR9IS,"Would be very challenging for a couch potato. I am a former athlete and am now a physical therapist. I don't generally work out a whole lot, but my job keeps me strong. I would say this work out is a 6 out of 10 in difficulty. So if you can't get to the gym this is a good alternative so you feel like you actually did some exercise at least that day",1524355200,,350,3.808219178082192
