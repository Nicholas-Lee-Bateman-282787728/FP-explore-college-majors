8124892,2,B000FNXNH4,It was ok. Definitely not worth $40 at the time of this writing. 4/22/16 Sure there are a few good naked scenes but not enough to save this from boredom zone. I usually love 80's schlock but this was not one of my favs. All the kills are off camera and the body count is low. Pass but at least I can now say I watched Iced. But it will only be once for me.,1461283200,,356,3.76
8124893,4,B000FNXNH4,"Iced is a late 80's slasher movie that starts off a little slow, but really picks up steam toward the end. The final twenty minutes are awesome, with some great death scenes and a killer ending. There is also a lot of nudity in this one, male and female. So if you can find it, you should watch it if you're a slasher fan. It's available to watch on youtube.",1279929600,,358,4.128571428571429
8124894,3,B000FNXNH4,"If you ever wondered what happened to cute little Wednesday Addams (Lisa Loring) from TV's The Addams Family, you can watch Iced to discover for herself that she really grew up (and in all the right places).  Fortunately, I didn't realize until the film was over that the buxom brunette who kept getting naked in the movie was little Wednesday all grown up because there's just something icky about that whole idea.  (I should also mention that Debra Deliso, who many will recognize from The Slumber Party Massacre, didn't mind shedding her clothes for her part, either.)  The last time I saw Loring, she was on some talk show claiming that all the scars on her arms were caused by an auto accident, but the truth was that she was a drug addict.  That was some time after Iced was released in 1987, when Loring was married to a porn actor (Jerry Butler).  Oddly enough, Loring's then-husband Doug Stevenson actually stars in Iced - as another character's husband; in real life, the two were already on the outs.

I must admit, this movie turned out to be better than I expected - but my expectations weren't very high at all to begin with.  The cheap opening credits and horrible, what I dearly hope was free, synthesizer music did not bode well at all, nor did the introduction of the characters - almost all of whom come across as real jerks as they goad Jeff Stinson (Dan Smith) into backing up his challenge of racing down the slopes against fellow pretty boy Cory (Doug Stevenson).  Having come to the ski resort with Trina (Debra Deliso), Jeff naturally takes offense to Cory's obvious flirtation with her.  When he loses, to the seeming delight of his friends, Jeff throws a big hissy fit and decides to take out his aggression on one more night-time run down the slopes.  There he learns the hard lesson that drinking and skiing just don't mix.  Four years after his death, the old gang comes together at Snow Peak, having been invited for a free weekend at this brand new ski resort.  Unfortunately for us viewers, we actually have to spend time getting to know these awful people all over again - but not for long, as some mystery killer starts snuffing them out one by one (and in some pretty interesting ways).

The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Cory and Trina are married now, the biggest dweeb of them all is now a doctor who is married to Jeff's cousin (who is a bit of a head case), Jeannette (Loring) is still hot to trot, and the other guy (whatever his name is) is still a cokehead - and they are all even more annoying now than they were before.  You don't really care if the killer is Jeff or Jeff's ghost or someone else; you just want to see him take these prima donnas out.  And whoever our killer really is, the man knows what he is doing, and he does it with flair.  If nothing else, Iced features some pretty impressive killings.

Sure, the characters are pretty annoying, but I say this film doesn't get the respect it deserves.  Slashers weren't exactly new on the scene by 1988, and Iced offered viewers something different.  All of that ice and snow just makes the blood stand out all the more, I say.  As for the killer, it's hard to be completely sure of his identity until the end, and that whole ""is dead Jeff actually alive?"" question makes the film more interesting than it would be otherwise.  I don't even think the gimmicky conclusion is all that bad, either.  Unfortunately, most people may not get the chance to judge this film for themselves unless it's finally given its long-overdue DVD release.  Until that happens, I say it's worth tracking down by hardcore horror fans.",1201996800,6,3637,4.542944785276074
