6007371,4,B00FLDG52I,I wonder why Carlos Santana is never invited to this event! He is a great admirer of Mr. Clapton and I'm assuming the feeling is reciprocated! They have toured together and recorded together! Invite Mr. Santana next time!  Ed Carson,1383177600,,232,4.8
6007372,4,B00FLDG52I,"However, I noticed Quinn Sullivan made it and it is evident that no lime light was shared with him. Where the hell is Mike Zito, from Texas? How about Joe Bonamassa? Did notice that Beth Hart is performing and she is very talented. I'd like to see Quinn Sullivan rip it up with a couple of his new songs from Cyclone and I'm Getting There. Come on, he is 14 and already got there!",1382745600,3,380,4.148648648648648
6007373,5,B00FLDG52I,"While I obviously haven't seen the video yet, I did see the theater release during the summer.  This year's benefit is as good as the 3 previous shows, with some highlights that, to me, were pure gold.  John Mayer and Keith Urban doing a ""Don't Bring Me Down"" was very high on my list and a short acoustic set with Greg Allman, Warren Haynes, and Derek Trucks was absolutely fantastic.  The typical guitar-heavy, star studded offerings did not disappoint in any way, except in the absence of any footage (in the theater release) of B. B King.  I can only assume his age is a factor there.  I'm pre-ordering the DVD and the CD (wonderful addition to the available formats) and will be counting the days until they arrive.",1382400000,68,720,4.550387596899225
6007374,4,B00FLDG52I,"I haven't watched this concert, but have all the preceding 3 others on DVD, and I will most certainly buy this fourth one, and any more in future that Eric will organize for this noble cause of recovery from addiction. The only reason I give it 4 stars is, I find the invitees to be more or less the same guitar players. And some are not my favorites at all - Jimmy Vaughan or Los Lobos for instance. I just wish Eric would invite other guitar players too - Steve Lukather and Robben Ford come to my mind. Having said that, the concerts are generally first rate and if you even have anything remote to do with the guitar, you won't be disappointed!",1382313600,8,648,4.276422764227642
6007375,5,B00FLDG52I,"We have the dvd's from the prior Crossroads Guitar Festivals. Crossroads is Eric Clapton's fund raiser for the substance abuse recovery facility he established in Antigua to help others recover from chemical addiction as he did. The concept is simple -- Eric invites a large group of guitarists from virtually every style of music. The musicians come and play in a concert that, this year, ran from 7 to approximately 11, Friday & Saturday evenings at Madison Square Garden in New York City. We were only able to get tickets for Saturday's concert and were anxious for the Blu-ray/dvd to sample the Friday night concert. For anyone who likes guitar played by the very best artists, Crossroads provides a unique opportunity to hear icons play live. The concert was expensive, our tickets were $400 each for the evening, but the chance to hear all the artists in one evening in 4-1/2 of continuous performance made the price a true value. The concert happens approximately every three years and based on our experience, if there is another Crossroads, we want to attend both nights.
The Blu-ray will not provide every minute of both nights. I wish it would. But we did attend the one night movie theater performance and found that the editors caught the very best performances from Saturday night. I'm sure the same was true from Friday. While the Blu-ray can't be as good as being there, it is the next best thing. Check out the list of performers. We have found that Crossroads has opened our appreciation of music and artists from styles of music that we had previously ignored. As a music lover, I can say that this should be on your shelf -- in fact, you really ought to buy the Blu-rays/dvd's from the prior concerts to have a complete collection. I pre-ordered this as soon as it became available and can't wait to receive it.
Don't miss this. Plus, proceeds from this help support Crossroads in the fight against chemical addiction.",1382054400,47,1938,4.770833333333333

6007399,5,B00FLDG52I,"In what may turn out to be the last of Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festivals, it may be the best of all. Similar in style to the previous shows in 2004, 2007, and 2010, the lineup is varied but great overall.
Blues is the theme but plenty of other genres are represented as well.
The highlight for me was Gregg Allman's version of The Needle and the Damage Done. Incredible, and poignant considering the setting.
Eric Clapton closes the show as usual and provides plenty of guitar sparks.
Plenty of reasons to check this one out !",1513987200,,535,4.525773195876289

  Summary Rating: D

This good performances from talented musicians coupled with decent audio and video is marred by severe lip sync issues on both disks. Unless you have a high tolerance for this sort of issue, it's probably best to give this one a pass.

More disturbingly, some of these performers are no longer with us, and what could have been an exceptional product release was compromised by a basic quality issue. It's not clear how something like this happen today. Was this technical incompetence? Was it rushed out the door to grab sales dollars? Regardless, one can only hope that the producers of this disk find a way to fix this problem and re-release these disks.",1500336000,5,817,4.826086956521739

The two slide guitar greats square off with an unbelievable, blistering, technically brilliant yet emotionally satisfying display of guitar self indulgence.  I wasn't sure anyone could ""keep up"" with Trucks when he really gets after it, but Landreth has no problem there.  The song is worth the price alone.  I cannot recommend it more highly.

6007686,5,B00FLDG52I,"I gave it 5 stars for the music. I think the music on the 2013 concert is the best yet. All guitarists played there asses off, didn't feel like any were holding back as on other crossroads concerts, which may have felt that way at times because of songs selected. So many players were outstanding. I especially liked Sonny Landreth and Gary Clark Jr. Buddy Guy really kicked butt. Odd there isn't one woman guitarist  Looking forward to many more listenings, but......
The production values are total s**t. The production company that put this together should be in a different business. Poor player staging for the cameras, mediocre camerawork and hack directing.
Never mind the out of synch sound/video and the horrible flashing white noise very noticeable on black backgrounds. I have sent my disks in for replacement, hopefully noise issues were from poor duplication.
If this production is any reflection of the Crossroads Center, boy are their patients in trouble.
I'll update findings on replacement disk.

UPDATE: I received a replacement disk from Rhino, no difference. I believe they made an error mastering the bluray disk. The menus work horribly too.
A partial solution I found that works on my DLP set is to turn down the brightness and contrast during a scene that's noisy picturewise and you will see the noise diminish. The picture does get dark somewhat, but still very watchable and noise is MUCH less noticeable.",1411776000,2,1432,4.9625

Vince Gill, Albert Lee & Keith Urban alone are worth the price of admisson. All the smaller complaints appear even smaller upon viewing. Here's mine, in the song menu only the song titles are listed, no artists; the audio options are limited, pcm stereo & dts surround and there are artist/selection redundancies from previous Crossroads dvds. There are moments when direction, editing and even focusing issues appear but those are even smaller complaints. One last thing to gripe about, there is no info as to who the side musicians are, not until I heard him sing 'High Time We Went' did I realize the keyboardist was Paul Carrack. I have the first two Crossroads and passed on the third because it seemed like business as usual, but seeing the Gill, Lee, Urban stuff pushed me to purchase, and I have no regrets.",1411430400,7,974,4.603448275862069

First, to get one thing out of the way:  The sync between the audio and video was way off, something like 125 ms.  It took me about 20 minutes to get it fixed, came very close to sending it back.  That is my only complaint.

Things I loved:

-The production values (audio and video) were at the highest level, probably one of the best shot and edited live concerts.  The camera angles, composition and editing were incredibly good at capturing the what was going on on stage, in particular the interaction between these great musicians.  The quality of the video was flawless.  WOW!  The sound mix was also very well done.  The 5.1 DTS gave the mixers plenty of soundstage to place the players without it sounding like a gimmick.
- Derek Trucks just keeps getting better.  Clapton is a great bandmate to all who share his stage, but you can see his jaw drop several times when he was watching Trucks play
-Very nice to see Clapton give Andy Fairweather Low some spotlight
-Booker T looked like he was having the time of his life.  The band sounded great.
-Mayer and Urban were great together.  They have staying power, maybe they'll be hosting this 20 years from now?
-The Almann Bros Band sounded as good as ever.  Very good version of Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad and Greg seems to be in good health and fine voice. (Needle and Damage Done and Midnight Rider)
-Robert Cray singing was over the top.  His best ever
-Vince Gill, Albert Lee and Keith Urban ++++++, impressive to see Urban keep up with these guys on guitar
-Keb Mo and Taj Mahal, classy acoustic blues.  A great segment that added depth and variety to the concert

6007742,4,B00FLDG52I,"Update Dec 2014.

I hadn't played this DVD in a while and gave it another try, this time on a different DVD player (Samsung BD-H5900). On this player the sound and video quality are very good, unlike my prior views with a Sony player. I can't explain why it's better now; perhaps the old DVD player wasn't properly set to accommodate this DVD (but it played many other DVDs just fine). Now, the audio sync is OK in DTS 5.1, and the grainy video is gone. I don't have the old Sony player to do a test, so I'll likely never know what caused the problem.

So I've raised the star count on this video. It's a good very show (although the 2007 Crossroads concert is still my favorite).

Original review
====
There must be a story behind the terrible production of an otherwise excellent concert. The audio sync and noisy digital video are the worst I have ever seen. The previous three Crossroads have much higher quality. The raw material in the 2013 show should be better than ever, yet camera focus seems to challenge some of the operators. And although the audio mix and quality are fine, the constant audio sync problem are very distracting. I can listen to this DVD but cannot watch it because the audio sync problems are nauseating. So it's okay if you don't know a Fender from a Gibson from a Grestch, and just want some background music, but it's a definite no-go for a has-been wanna-be guitarist (such as myself) who likes to study what is going on.

This DVD should be embarrassing for the producers. Perhaps they will fix the problems and kindly offer an exchange for us many fans who bought the show based on the prior concert discs. This production is very, very disappointing, and not worthy to bear the Crossroads name.",1405814400,,1737,4.487341772151899

The video quality is terrible in that the dark portions of the screen are covered with a snow like distortion. The window to return the item is expired. So I'm stuck with a blu ray that is more useful as a drink coaster.

The performance starts and stops and between performances they show some pre-setup material which was a nice touch.  There is no encore.  There are 45 performances and it will take you 2 nights to watch the 2 DVDs.  I didn't time it but it's many hours long, perhaps 5.  The sound and video are in sync.  The audio is recorded well.  And there are no real video pasting blemishes.  There is no announcer and you will have to look at the box to see who is playing.  A lot of the musicians speak about the show but unless you know them, there is no way to know who they are.

Some of the couplings of the artists were truly inspiring.  Others, well not so much.... some of the greats from the past don't seem to have much left and a few had to helped to and from the stage.  There is a large amount of time spent on a couple of players and I felt it could have been spread out with some others who got either very little or no coverage at all.

6007828,3,B00FLDG52I,"Fans of previous Crossroads Guitar Festivals will not be disappointed with the excellence of Eric and his entourage of top notch musicians.  As noted by others, the enjoyment of the DVDs is marred by AV synch issues and the occasional less than optimal video quality in some darker shots.

The music is delightful and the audio mixing sounds great on my 5.1 surround sound.  But for me the off audio and video synchronization is sometimes distracting, like a gnat that buzzes around your head, sometimes close and sometimes far enough away to not bug me so much. This kind of thing might not be a big deal for you.

My only other comment is that this is the first of the Crossroads series I own that was indoors.  Even though it is at Madison Square Garden, it did not have the same less formal, fun, festival feeling for me as the others did.  Nevertheless, the performances on balance - I liked some better than others - were every bit as special as the previous shows.

In summary - this is a must have for Crossroads fans, but the DVD technical quality is not at the level that it should be and in rating the overall package I can only go with 3 stars.",1395446400,2,1156,4.39906103286385

6007866,4,B00FLDG52I,"OK, most concert videos bug me...unless they're shot by Martin Scorcese, you get closeups of the bass player when the guy on the other side of the stage is playing lead.  Or a quick blurry zoom when they realize who they should be filming and cut back.  Oh well, this video's got it's fair share of that.  On the last song Paul Carrack is almost invisible and yet he's singing lead...more on that last song in a moment.

Despite all that, the performances are really good.  Highlights for me include Taj Mahal and Keb Mo, Vince Gill and Albert Lee, Clapton playing with the Allman Brothers Band and Jeff Beck.  I went to see Clapton about a month before these concerts, so I'm a little partial to his band performances too.

Weakest spot for me (and I cringed when I saw ""ensemble"" on the box) was the last song, ""High Time We Went"".  Clapton's band did that as the finale on their concert tour leading up to the Crossroads festival, and it was a great closer.  Here, with a dozen or more guitar heros on stage it just seemed drawn out and boring.  These 'everybody come out and join together on the last song' closers have never been my cup of tea, but this one seems to go on forever...

Jeff Beck is a highlight as always.  Beth Hart is such a fantastic addition to Beck's band. (Side note: Jeff should consider doing an album with various female vocalists. Somehow the combo of the female vocal and his guitar just shine!). Sonny Landreth's solo performance is an absolute gem. Doyle II never disappoints.

The new surprises were a performance from the Allman's with Derek and Warren that is flawless. And Keith Urban shows his chops both vocally and instrumentally on ""Tumbling Dice"".",1392595200,2,753,5.147540983606557

However; my pet peeve is the camera work.  This time the director seems to enjoy showing close ups of the musicians' faces.  It's a guitar festival, so show the players' fingering, picking and struming not their faces.  Also, I would like to see more focus on the bass players.  They are seldom shown in any detail.

All in all, I highly this DVD to all guitar lovers.",1392595200,,511,4.489130434782608

Gary Clark Jr's and, of course, Jeff Beck's. No subtitles at all, which I consider somewhat awful, as the first Crossroads brings even the lyrics to the songs. About the video quality, after watching it on a 42 inches LED TV (from a friend), I finally came to an awkward conclusion: As it is, this Blu-Ray (and DVD) shouldn't have been commercialy released!!! Extreme amount of ""video noise"". In my opinion, all discs bought through Amazon Marketplace and its sellers should be immediately replaced with no cost to the consumers, including myself.

6007914,2,B00FLDG52I,"I'm half way through the BluRay, and all I can say is I've never seen more out of focus shots in any concert.
Were they attempting to look artsy? After the first 100 out of focus, roll in, then out again I was ready to get seasick.
Then, why are they shooting a right handed guitar player from the screen right? I saw a lot of the back of the neck
and body until a camera got the correct shot. This looks more like YouTube and less like professionals.
I could understand if it was shot in Bolivia, but it's Madison Square Garden, for god's sake.
Now, the good. I thought the audio was nice and crisp, a good mix of vocals and instruments, although the drum kit was lacking. You'd see a close up of a drumstick on cymbals and never hear it.
Maybe it will grow on me.
Clapton is great, as usual.
They bring in new players with a V.O. introduction from the player, and I have no Idea who it is. I guess I'm supposed to know. ""I'm really proud to be here. I'm a Clapton fan."" Great, who are you?

Not up to ""Crossroads"" standards.

UPDATE:
I watched it all the way through. If anything, it's worse than my first impression. Nobody is introduced, they just show up.
if you don't know them, you're left in the dark. Maybe the liner notes name the players. Maybe card girls were going through the audience, and we never see them. Like boxing.
The out of focus shots were terrible. So many they were intentional.
How come I can see an auto race and everything is in focus, but a guy on stage standing still is never in focus.
At one point there's a shot of the back of Jimmy Vaughn's head, and it's out of focus. Were you all stoned when you edited this?

Plenty of graphics for credits, just not for the show. I'm making it two star. Watch it with your eyes closed. Er, listen",1391126400,7,1769,4.197058823529412

It isn't so far off as to where I can't watch it but, it is noticeable. The picture is good but I can definitely see the limitations in the camera as far as when it pans the focus is in and out. But over all the picture is very good. The sonics are great. Every bit as good as the last one. The performances are fantastic.

I could hear the music just fine but I told myself that I would just have to wait for the DVD or Blu-ray release to actually see what I heard. The music is great and the camera work is excellent. My only complaint is that they didn't include any footage of Dan Aykroyd -- the MC for the festival. I'm not saying that I want them to spend lots of time on him but he was a part of the overall experience and his absence from the video is odd -- especially considering that Bill Murray got so much camera time when he hosted.,1390348800,3,633,4.072

There was so much noise on my TV screen, I got a headache within 20 seconds.  How any company can release a piece of crap like this in 2013 is beyond me.  Did no one watch it before shipping it?  The audio isn't even synced properly to the video.  I've read lots of rave reviews on this, but those people must have pretty crap televisions if it looks good to them.  Concerts on Palladia looked wayyyyyyyy better.  Whoever filmed this thing should be barred from any further film making.  Seriously, it deserves 0 stars.  Also - camera people, it's called focus.  Learn how to use it.  If you're ten feet away and can't keep Eric Clapton from looking like a blurry blob, you are bad at your job.

Reps from most genres are here including country (Vince Gill, Keith Urban) to jazz (Earl Klugh) but most of these songs are rock, blues or mostly a combination of both. Occasionally, one of the guests will speak about the venue, Clapton or other influences but they are infrequent and brief. The focus here is on the music. While there are certainly no clunkers, here are my favorites so far. ""Green Onions"" by my old IU classmate, Booker T. who has a host of guitarists helping him out. ""She's Alright"" with Doyle Bramhall II and Gary Clark, Jr., ""Big Road Blues"" with Kurt Rosenwinkel and Eric Clapton, ""Don't Let Me Down"" with John Mayer and Keith Urban and ""Whipping Post"" with the Allman Brothers Band (Gregg Allman, Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes). Can't wait to watch the second disc. Stay tuned.

The second disc of this 2 day event actually runs about 2  hours and has some of some of the best guitar based blues-rock you will ever hear. Many of the musicians that are on the first disc reappear here and from what I can tell, are still part of the set list suggested in disc 1. I think the creators of the discs just wanted to keep the song selections short and create more interest in who's coming on next. It works, and I don't care but I sure am glad there is this second disc. For example, Gary Clark, Jr. returns with Doyle Bramhall II for ""When My Train Pulls In,"" a blistering piece of music with both guitarists hard at work. Taj Mahal shows up for the first time with Keb' Mo'. Los Lobos also appear for the first time and get a little help from Robert Cray and Clapton. And if you are wondering if Clapton gets in on some real action rather than just some guest pickin', the answer is hell yes. He is featured on the 6 songs beginning with a duet with Keith Richards, and yes he's still got it. Even the closing number which features the ensemble and seemingly hundreds of guitars comes off well, with each of the featured artists getting a few riffs in on ""High Time We Went."" What a great package this is.

The Blu ray package comes with a 1080p resolution and has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The detail looks fine along with color and contrast.  Skin tones are very good and there are numerous close-ups where blemishes and hair are easily distinguishable.  I did notice several shots seemed to go in and out of focus.  I suspect this is more a problem with the cameramen or editing than the quality of the transfer.  A minor annoyance.  The audio has a couple options.  One is a linear PCM stereo track and the other is a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I stuck with the surround option for most of the concert, but did listen a bit to the stereo as well.  Both sounded great, but for me the surround offered a more spacious feel.  This concert should be played loud and everything worked and sounded as I expected.  There are no extras.",1389312000,9,3223,4.385906040268456

The problem is the video editing.  I doubt if the Director (Martyn Atkins) or the Editors (Erick Yablon & Joe D'Augustine) or the Director of Photography (Jurg Walther) have ever done a project like this.  It's a ""Guitar Festival"".  So one would think the DVD would focus on the guitarist or other soloist who is performing.  Not this DVD.  I cannot tell you how many times the cameras were showing something other than the person playing the guitar or, more specifically, his hands.  Saw lots of backs of performers.  A very frustrating DVD to watch.  I'm no feminist crusader, but there was not one single female guitarist.  My biggest surprise was the good guitar work by Keith Urban.  I wasn't familiar with him.  Nicole chose well.  Like I said, probably best to just buy the CD of this one and listen rather than watch.",1389052800,,1001,4.576271186440678

6008089,4,B00FLDG52I,"I own all four of the Crossroads DVDs and they are fantastic.  They all have a wide range of music and great musical moments depending on your taste in music and who you like.

That being said, the video quality on this Blu-ray is very poor.

6008109,3,B00FLDG52I,"As others have mentioned - the soundtrack is out of sync with the video.  Makes it very awkward to watch at times.  Certainly does not reflect a professional production job - at all.  Same issue on both discs too.

For other Crossroads concerts I have the 2004 DVD, and have recorded & watched the 2010 on my DVR.  For whatever reason the technical quality of this Blu-ray version is the worst of the bunch - by far.  Not only is the audio & video out of sync, but it just seems that the overall shooting of the video was not to the same standards as before.  For example - during some of the guitar leads the video is showing the base player playing - not the guitarist playing the lead.  Or they might show his face, but not his fingerboard.  Not all the time - but occasionally.

Got this as a Christmas present -

As for the music - this group of musicians varies somewhat from prior concerts, and I would say there is more of an acoustic / bluesy theme to this 2013 concert than others. Not to say that there is anything wrong with the performances - just that it's a somewhat different mix of music & musicians. But this is why I watch these so intently - to pick up on new artists, new talent, and sometimes - new songs.  Glad to see the Allman Brothers performing in this concert.

So whether you like these musicians and/or the music will strictly be a personal preference, and my rating this DVD is strictly based on the technical issues noted above, not the music.  As usual, Eric Clapton has done a fantastic job of assembling a large group of musicians whom he appreciates.  I would hope that for his next Crossroads he can get Tommy Emmanuel to perform as well, as he is one of my favorite guitarists of all time.  Also would like to see him bring back Eric Johnson - another favorite of mine.",1388707200,3,1807,4.317507418397626

6008195,3,B00FLDG52I,"Have seen all of the previous shows and enjoyed them all...... was really looking forward to the 2013 show.... got the set and started jumping through the two discs to see the artists I really wanted to see.... I started with disc two and when I went to song 15, nothing except a red warning sign..... tried the disc on two different dvd players and nothing after song 14 and there are 23 songs on the dvd according to the song list.  I then tried the dvd on our laptop.... interesting that now there are songs starting at 15, but they are from the songs on disc one.... also, the song list on the menu has songs listed that are not from the 2013 show.....  disc one was fine by the way.....
overall, I enjoyed what I was able to see....  like some other reviews, I did question some of the shot selections (especially some really shaky shots and some shots where they could not seem to focus)..... but I've done video production and I know that the editors want it to look different and keep your attention....
my favorite songs were: Midnight Rider and Whipping Post

Supremely better than the last DVD performed in Chicago. The picture quality of BluRay and 5.1 Surround sound make this performance shine.
Notable performances: the BB King set, Gary Clark Jr. with Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes inciteful observations about how Clapton influenced today's crop of blues guitar players. Not to be too critical, but EC should stop inviting Jimmy Vaughn.

Serious noise throughout all the concert shots, and its not my player or the Blue ray disc itself, as they cuts to interviews off stage that are fine and noise free.

The first indoor venue adds some intimacy with the musicians and you pick up little things like Kieth Urbans guitar strap coming off during his duet with John Mayer (shades of The Last Waltz). I was actually at both nights of this concert and I wish they would just release all ten hours instead of editing it. But they definitely got the highlights. Lot's of Clapton of course but Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, Gary Clark Jr. (****). were in top form. Keith Richards was a nice surprise at the show but anyone who doesn't catch their breath at Greg Allman's ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" isn't paying attention.

We were ""doin' some 'serious pickin'"" as we say down Home, and my friend grew pensive, ""hmmed,"" and put his coricidin bottle (which he was using as a slide - same as Duane used to use) down on the table.  ""You know,"" he said, ""I ain't much like that boy since that 'Crossroads CD set' thing come out in - whut - 1988?  He jus' tryin' to draw attention to himself 'cause of that drug-addict place.""  I said, ""Well...yeah, but what about that GREAT song, 'Pretending'?""  My friend is one of those folks who absolutely cannot tell a lie, and he replied, ""You jus' like that song (LOUD chuckling) 'cause you wuz goin' thru a divorce at th' time!""  And he may or may not have been right, but when I told my friend that I was really anxious to pick up ""Crossroads '13"" because A) ""Cher""yl Crowe AIN'T on it B) Keef comes out, more or less stably, and does a most leviticously-deuteronomous ""Key To The Highway,"" with just himself, EC, Willie Weeks, and Steve Jordan, alone this time out; and C) '13 has Booker T teaming up, for a ""once-off,"" I imagine, with old MG's fellow musician, guitarist Steve Cropper.  When I told my friend about the (for lack of a better way to phrase it) ""Booker T"" factor in my decision, he started chuckling again, and told me, ""Boy...yo' Mama done raised you right.""

6008289,5,B00FLDG52I,I have all of these and this one stands out. Clapton is still a great great artist. The performances were outstanding. Even John Mayer(whoa). This new kid Gary Clark Jr. is outstanding. From my standpoint Eric having jazz players like Earl Klugh and Kurt Rosenwinkel where wonderful. Both of whom are incredible players. It's great to see mutual respect amongst the players regardless of their chosen genre. There were a couple of people here that shall remain nameless that just where a waste of time. Beck was magical. Lambeth is a total original and has  incredible energy. Of course what's the world without Keith Richards but a really really boring place. Erics opening performances where wonderful. This is definitely a keeper. Love the interviews. How do you not love BB and Taj Mahal. Enjoy!!,1386460800,2,800,4.970149253731344
6008290,2,B00FLDG52I,I love the concerts....I HATE the discs! Same complaint as several other reviews....Disc Two suddenly became Disc One right before the Jeff Beck slot. I was anxious to see Jeff Beck and the disc from that point began showing sections that were on Disc One. What The Hell! Manufacturing defect for sure. I thought Rhino was better than this. Where can I send this back for a set of discs that work?,1386460800,4,397,4.527777777777778
6008291,4,B00FLDG52I,"I have to agree with so many other reviewers, this is my least favorite of any of the Crossroads Concerts. The reason for it, I think has alot to do with the venue. It is in NYC and is the most serious of the Crossroads concerts. There are some great performances, too many too many to list and some stinkers such as Citizen Kope again sings his depressing music and Robbie Robertson proved he cannot sing and struggled with his guitar playing (likely out of practice, at least I hope he is not sick). This Bluray is worth owning, but all the other Crossroads Festivals are more joyfull. On this one you can see that musicians were padded with NYC union players that were not part of the group. I say buy it and enjoy it, but if you lack any of the other crossroad festival Dvds or bluray, buy them first and this one last.",1386374400,,823,4.282051282051282

I have had an earlier concert DVD of the Crossroads concert, but I feel this one is better period.  You receive hours of live music. Nice to see some of the greats like Taj Mahal. John Mayer does  ""Queen of California"" what a wonderful voice he has. Some of the better country singers Keith Urban and Vince Gill do a wonderful rendition of Tumbling Dice.

I'm eagerly waiting for Joe Bonamassa to make an appearance for a few songs!  I would have given this recent release 5 stars, had it not been for the somewhat poor video quality.  I experienced both a grainy picture and flashing of the video reproduction.  The sound quality is excellent. I have never adjusted my tv monitor for anything I watch, as I love the picture as it is (so why maybe ruin a good thing).

Eric, if you knew how bad the synch is, you wouldn't want your name on it...and i have every one of the Crossroads

On further review it appears that the DVD authors were completely inexperienced. My guess is that someone with a  copy of Final Cut Pro and DVD Studio convinced someone that he/she/they could author the DVD. The tipoff, other than the terrible sync is that when you go to Songs, each ""page"" starts out with the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. which is the DVD Studio default. Anyone with an ounce of understanding would know to number the pages in consecutive order.

The Camera shots, shaky Point of View handheld camerawork, camera angles and stupid editing choices RUIN this DVD.

I don't like giving bad reviews. I'm just so frustrated when Directors and Editors don't know how to shoot and edit a live music performance!!! I'll speak for me... I want to just see them perform live with a good view of them and the band!! THAT'S IT!!

Who is this DVD mostly aimed at? Music lovers, musicians and Guitar Players!!

I don't need and don't want fancy, dizzying camera work, ridiculous closeup shots, fast editing, and artsy fartsy crap. One of many examples is a shot of Gregg Allman's Foot on the B3 while Derek Trucks is soloing!!!
I love Gregg, but want to see each musician play ESPECIALLY while they are soloing!!!
So many times I yelled ""Come on!!"" to the TV because I want to see the fretboard, guitar player's hands and the artist express himself (or herself) in music and they cut away to a Stupid shot of the audience or another musician who's NOT soloing!! I just don't get it!!!!

What are/where they thinking????!!!!

""A Concert for George"" comes to mind as an EXCELLENT DVD because they kept the shots simple and just let the viewer watch a great show. That's all we want!!!

I wish some concert DVDs were reissued with a 'normal, non A.D.D. Edition' or at least give the choice to the viewer which style they want to watch the concert in.

There are so many great concerts that have been absolutely ruined (in my opinion). It's Exasperating!!!!

I wish someone with similar thoughts could get the word to these people who think they're being 'cutting edge' and artistic to STOP!!!
End of rant. I feel a little better, but I still have a ruined concert DVD.  LOL

P.S. I wish I could give this 5 stars just to all the amazing artists on this show.",1386115200,2,2056,4.52972972972973

The recording of this is much more slick in that it appears to have been staged so that it could be filmed better than the others. Not what I was looking for.....while all of the musicians perform well and the sound is good for me it lacks the concert feel. Perhaps it's the venue. Eric Clapton is of course doing a great job playing the music and supporting the other musicians but the music on this dvd is different. Hard to put my finger on what there is about this video that seems less than the others.... Gotta wonder why Doyle Brahmhall is trying to look like Robert Brady. Someone should probably talk to him about the hair and clothes..
Sonny Landreth is awesome as usual and Booker T and the MG's.... well ya gotta love that part of the show. Green Onions, Time is Tight........very well done!
This is well recorded and the video is very good. The music........well....ymmv.

6008386,5,B00FLDG52I,"You'd be hard pressed to find a more enthusiastic fan of Eric Clapton and the musicians that join him at the crossroads guitar festival than myself. I own all the previous crossroads festivals on blu ray and DVD as well as all of the other Eric Clapton concert videos that have been made commercially available. I was also at one of Eric's shows from his tour earlier this year, so I have a good idea of how things should sound.

My home theater consists of a 2012 model 55"" Panasonic plasma TV, a PS3, Denon receiver, and Rotel amplification for a pair of bowers and wilkins 685 speakers.  My TV is professionally calibrated, and my speakers are tuned to my listening room using audyssey calibration. My remarks on the audio and video quality of this blu ray are as follows-

Video- Very sharp and clean image. Contrast is fantastic, and the clarity of the image can't be faulted. This concert was shown in movie theaters, and the image quality would be right at home at an IMAX theater. This is a presentation only possible due to the high resolution available on the blu ray format. No doubt compression artifacts and noise will be seen in the DVD version due to the limitations of the format. There is an incredible lack of grain and noise despite the dark conditions around the performers and stage. The editing and camera angles are difficult to fault, with plenty of close ups of the feet work of the individual guitar players. You get a wonderful impression and understanding of how the musicians are communicating on stage. Video quality is 10/10.

Audio- What a challenge for the producers to mix the sound! Often a half dozen guitar players are performing simultaneously, along with many other instruments and yet the mix was not crowded or busy. When I was at one of the shows on Clapton's tour this past year I was stunned at the unreal clarity of his vocals in a live setting. Honestly the best I've ever heard a lead vocal sound at an indoor concert. That same impression comes through on the blu ray. Turn up the volume and hear the crystal clear sound of Eric's voice on tears in heaven to hear an example. The uncompressed DTS-MA audios a revelation of beauty. Bass notes are full and clear, vocals soar with punch and dynamics, and every instrument is mixed to perfection. I'd imagine with a proper amplification system this concert could be re-played and with your eyes closed you would believe you were actually at the concert and not at home. I own perhaps 100 concert blu rays and DVDs and have heard plenty of poorly mixed junk. This concert tops mayer's where the light is, Clapton's previous crossroads 2010 festival, the clapton and winwood concert, and Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds at radio city in terms of audio quality. It's spectacular, and sets a new standard for concert blu rays.

What about the concert itself? In my opinion, this is the best overall package of performances from any crossroads festival. The musicians are all extremely comfortable and their playing is especially inspired. I was introduced to some new songs and artists and reminded of why I have such a deep love for blues and rock music. These players all have music deep down in their soul and their playing and singing comes from deep within themselves. It's a refreshing reminder of where great music comes from and the uniquely human expression that flows from live musicians unaided by technology. It's all about the music, and you can sense from every performer that they are kindred spirits with one another. Highlights include Robert Cray. The Allman Brothers, John Mayer, Gary Clark Jr... Actually the whole concert is one enormous highlight reel... nothing should be skipped... it should all be savored.

Best $20 I've spent all year. I'll be watching and listening to this for the rest of my lifetime",1385164800,74,3819,4.726726726726727
6008387,5,B00FLDG52I,"Just finished watching the 2013 Crossroads guitar festival and thought it was awesome! I love how the show was done with Eric getting things started and sharing the stage with some very talented musicians. The best is how they finish it all; they entertain you throughout and blow you away with guitar playing of different styles from so many talented people but then Eric comes on for some of his solo work and you realize why he is ""The Guitar God."" How can you not enjoy the way he does Crossroads or Sunshine of your Love? Highly recommend this DVD for any Eric Clapton die-hard fan.",1385164800,2,587,4.547169811320755

6008389,5,B00FLDG52I,"Ordered 11/19 & received 11/21.
Played both DVD discs & they had none of the problems mentioned in other reviews.(White lines across screen, poor audio)
There were some out of focus moments as the cameramen locked into a close-up, but given the material came from 2 live concerts filmed indoors, I didn't expect it to be perfect.

A lot of  energy, and enjoyment permeates the DVD's & the guitar playing is outstanding. It has the feel of an event at which the musicians had a hell of a good time.

Favorites include  ""The Needle and The Damage Done"", (Allmans, Haynes & Trucks),  & ""Don't Let me Down' (John Mayer & Keith Urban), but for me the standout was Gary Clarke Jr. His falsetto & clean playing on ""Please Come Home"" was something else.
And he showed his versatility with a grinding version of ""When My Train Pulls In"". Flashes of Hendrix in there
If your into blues or Clapton and the opportunity to see many top guitarists having a blast together, then I can recommend this DVD without hesitation.
The fact that it has about 15 more tracks than the CD is worth the purchase alone. & they are good tracks, not fillers.
I was remiss in not mentioning Eric earlier. He looked contented, I thought his voice was better than 2010 and his playing is still as 'fluid' as ever, to quote one of the Allman brothers.",1385078400,5,1317,4.516806722689076

BTW  I have two Oppo players and the same crap on both and a ES Sony...the analog and the HDMI both is out of sync, like they were using the video from a different night in some parts...

BTW and a clarification note, in this release the out of sync is not because of the use of the HDMI or not, the audio belongs to a different performance, simply as that, maybe some studio work or different night, as some words are in sync, and some are not...using HDMI or analog will give you the same result...I had watched it several times already, same result, BTW...the other BD I ordered from Rush, The Clockwork Angels Tour, is perfectly fine!!!!

6008407,5,B00FLDG52I,"My son joined me for a trip to New York to experience the Guitar Festival first hand. We sat on the side of the Garden near Stage Right on Friday night, and couldn't believe our good fortune as we enjoyed over 5 hours of stellar performances. Saturday night we were down on the floor about 10 rows out from Stage Left. Two unique perspectives that led to a wonderful 11 hours of celebratory music on both nights.
We have been looking forward to this Blu-ray coming out since we walked back to our hotel on Friday night, knowing that this would be filmed and turned into a world-class Blu-ray. Well, it was worth the wait, to say the least. The editing is superb, with very little distraction from the songs and the performances. Plenty of great shots to allow us to witness the virtuoso playing of the assembled throng of musical geniuses also. The selection of songs was better than we hoped for. The high points of each night were mostly captured, (how do you edit 11 hours of music down to 3-4 hours when the talent is this epic, and the performances are this brilliant?) and while some will quibble with the choices, I think the blu-ray captures the essence of what we experienced on those two magical nights at the Garden. It was a concert for the ages. The highlights are many, but pay close attention to Time is Tight, Cry, Don't Let Me Down, Damn Right, I've Got the Blues, on the first night, incredible! On the second night, highlights were Change It, The Needle and the Damage Done, Tumbling Dice, When My Train Pulls In, Key To the Highway, and Clapton's closing suite.  I cannot wait for 2016!

6008412,5,B00FLDG52I,"Just released today in Sydney Australia. Well, I can tell all you folks out there to buy it, although it may not be quite as  good as the last offering, dominated as it was by Derek Trucks, Los Lobos and Bill Murray. Well, Trucks and Los lobos are back, but no Susan Tedeschi.

So, to the DVD. Some good and sort of OK highlights:
Los Lobos as professional as ever, with a young fella equipping himself quite well behind the kits. He looks like Punky Brewster, and about 16 yrs old, but plays very well. On the Needle and the Damage Done, Greg Allman sings well, but it's Trucks on the slide that lends a subtle beauty to the song's melody.

On Tumbling Dice, Urban comes out swaggering like some CMC jock, and plays Tumbling Dice in a serviceable if not particularly great rendition.
Jeff Beck is excellent and plays here with his regular bassist Tal Wilkinfeld, probably in her 20s now, and a joy to watch and hear. Her rapport with Jeff Beck now is easy to sense. Which is more than I can say for Beth Hart, who Beck largely ignores as she tramples around on stage dominating proceedings. She sings fine, but am I the only one who finds her just a tad over-rated ?

Jeff Beck's Mna Na Heireann is a beautiful interlude, with some electric violin intoning exotic sounds. I really liked this, in spite of being a little out of context.

A guy called Blake Mills came on (never heard of him) and sang a crooner ballad that did nothing for me, but being unfamiliar with the guy, I'll leave it at that.

The Booker T segments are excellent, with Cropper, Matt Guitar Murphy, Lee and that Mills guy again taking turns at lead breaks. Excellent, and Booker T is having fun, probably more fun than the ill-fated stuff he did with Drive By Truckers a few years back.

Another player I was unfamiliar with, Kurt Rosenwinkel played some light jazz guitar in a similar vein to Wes Montgomery. I could  have done without it, but I'm not questioning the quality of the musicianship.

All the rest is predictably good, with Warren Haynes and Greg Allman lending a professional air to the evening's entertainment, and Clapton looking and sounding pretty good. I still preferred the last two DVDs but anyone even remotely enjoying classic rock and rhythm and blues will not want to miss this. I gave it 5 stars because, at the end of the day, I won't be churlish. There are some fabulous musicians on offer, and a few ornery moments doesn't change the fact that this is a music lover's basic diet, right here.",1384387200,82,2495,4.490066225165563

There are however obvious non-appearances in my book by guys who have so much talent it makes me scratch my head everytime. Say the likes of Nils Lofgren, Mick Taylor, Neil Young, Santana, Mark Knopfler, Mike Campbell, Marty Stuart, Blackhawk, Dave Edmunds, Jim Messina,David Marks and Al Jardine and Steve Miller just to name a few. Maybe they have been asked but couldn't make it. But to never be there? Always glad to see, BB, Jimmie Vaughan, Sonny Landreth, Robert Cray , Albert Lee, Vince Gill, the Allmans , Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy and some of the others. But there's one young guy who is there time and again and I can't see what the fuss is all about. I won't say who. But to me he is a poser. Riding on the coat tails of true blues men. I hope, that if Eric does another get together, he can get some of the ones I mentioned. I am sure Eric holds them in high esteem. And they him.",1384041600,6,1026,4.13

Here is how to find it: Disc 2, go to Extras, Interviews, Guitar Solos, then Main. Hit your left directional button, then hit play & bingo, you have Layla. At least, that's how I find it on my Oppo DVD player. I learned this trick from an Amazon reviewer years ago when this DVD first came out.",1383523200,48,391,4.090909090909091
