I was first introduced to the series by the original Jingle Cats L.P. and immediately caught the fever. Some of my friends are at first charmed by the general witt, and then, after several listenings, or watchings, they began to appreciate the musicianship showcased.
Great at parties!!!!!",1002844800,2,485,5.0625
