8064064,4,B0009OBHAE,I said that I received it before.  Just wished I had more time to read and listen to the instructions.,1405296000,,102,4.1
8064065,1,B0009OBHAE,I figured since I was puchasing the $18 DVD that it would be a more detailed product. Peter Ruth only explained the techniques of how to play. It was not a teacher to student type of lesson. After talking about the half dozen techniques he played songs that he thought would be easy to learn but NEVER taught you how to play them. He also said in the video that you could follow along in the book that came with the DVD but there was no book. VERY DISSAPOINTED!,1235520000,16,461,4.191011235955056
