7916666,5,B000035P9H,"First you have ""The Crusade"". Not much here. You only get Episodes 1 & 3 because Episodes 2 & 4 were destroyed and lost. You do, however, get the audio of Episodes 2 & 4, but without an audio narration and no script which makes it very difficult to understand what's going on. But I do have the scripts of the episodes that I printed off the internet, and I can honestly tell you that apart from Episode 1 this story was crap. But ""The Space Museum"" is another story.

""The Space Museum"" was a great story. I can't understand why this story is always criticized. Everyone agrees that Episode 1 is brilliant, but everyone seems to hate the rest of the story. Episode 2 was kind of a disappointment. The acting is bland, so is the directing, and Dennis Spooner's changes to the script of that episode doesn't help it. But Episodes 3 & 4 are great! This was no doubt the best story of the second season. A lot better than the highly overrated ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"", and it has a lot better special effects too. Highly recommended!",1269907200,,1035,4.390625
7916667,5,B000035P9H,"I really like these two stories of William Hartnell, flawed as they are by missing episodes.
The stories were originally transmitted between March 27 and May 15 1965. This release, despite the missing episodes, is a welcome addition to the Doctor Who library and is a must.
While the only flaw is the missing episodes, the BBC have finally delivered the goods by including the complete audio soundtrack on CD. Readers may be interested to know that in Britain the BBC has been releasing CD versions of missing stories, mainly from the Troughton era. Hopefully they will release them stateside soon.
What makes this release so good is the fact that side by side are the two facets of Doctor Who stories contained in one cassette. On the one hand you find the historical drama with the Doctor introducing the wider, younger, viewing public to the story of the Crusades, bringing history to life as it were and helping to invigorate dry history textbooks. Often with a Shakespearian slant, these stories also served a dual purpose in bringing drama to the same group.
The Space Museum is also notable for the innovative ideas which Doctor Who brought to television and to science fiction. No bug-eyed monsters here but a clever concept of moving ahead of yourself in time and seeing the outcome, with a plausible solution to what appears to be an intractable proble. Despite the cheap and flimsy sets the stories manage to hold our attention and keep us transfixed from episode to episode.
William Hartnell and the gang are excellent throughout as are the other actors. To my mind these are some of the best stories of the Hartnell years.",1026172800,11,1635,4.801418439716312
7916668,4,B000035P9H,"This tape consists of the two remaining episodes of The Crusade and the complete version of The Space Museum.  The Space Museum's first episode is fantastic, but the remaining three are a complete let-down.  Don't let this keep you from buying this tape.  The Crusade more than makes up for it; the plot and characterization are fantastic.  It's only a shame it isn't complete.  The missing episode's audio tracks do exist and are included on CD.",1009411200,3,446,4.815789473684211
7916669,5,B000035P9H,"This tape gives some classic examples of Doctor Who's early years. First a historical story full of political intrigue (coupled with the tragedy of the missing episodes), followed by a way out adventure in Time and Space. It was great to see William Russell reprising his role as Ian Chesterton for the linking narration in the introduction of the first episode and for the missing second and forth episodes of ""The Crusade""(I haven't listened to the CD with the audio from episodes 2 and 4 yet). I only got to see the black and white episodes once when I was growing up but I remember enjoying ""The Space Museum"" and it was a real treat to see it again. The collectible postcards with scenes from The Crusade were also a nice touch. Well worth adding to your collection.",994377600,2,771,4.594202898550725
7916670,4,B000035P9H,"For a fan that had never seen ""The Crusade"", I only wish all of it was there. ""The Crusade"" is a wonderful dramatic story. It's pretty hard core for the Hartnell era. The dialogue is absolutely  beautiful. And William Russell reprising his role as Ian is a nice touch,  although I do miss the telesnap idea the Restoration Team did for ""The  Ice Warriors"", but better than ""The Invasion"". Nice to see  Jean Marsh in her first Who role. ""The Space Museum"" starts off  very interesting. The idead that the TARDIS jumped a groove on the album of  Time, but then it turns into a rebels vs humanoid invaders story, that  moves very slowly and has some horrible guests who are doing their best  immitation of acting. But ""The Space Museum"" does have some  enjoyable moments: Episode 1, the Doctor feeding goofy images into  ""the thought machine(?)"", and Vicki stands out very well in  episode 3. There is a great stupid line in this one: ""Have any arms  fallen into Xeron hands?"", and many more. A highly enjoyable release  that almost any Who fan can enjoy.",948240000,8,1052,4.591397849462366
7916671,5,B000035P9H,"Of the DOCTOR WHO stories starring William Hartnell that I have seen so far, these two are my favorite. There is plenty of humor, intrigue and action to keep anyone interested. The quality of the video and audio is  surprisingly good, considering the restoration that was required (the  process of which is thoroughly detailed in the liner notes). STAR WARS fans  will recognized Julian Glover in THE CRUSADE (he played General Veers in  THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) and Jeremy Bulloch in THE SPACE MUSEUM (he played  Boba Fett in the trilogy). The two ""missing"" episodes of THE  CRUSADE are provided on compact disc - better that than nothing. But on the  video, William Russell provides linking narration in character as Ian  Chesterton to fill in the gaps. Very well done!",948240000,8,771,4.876923076923077
