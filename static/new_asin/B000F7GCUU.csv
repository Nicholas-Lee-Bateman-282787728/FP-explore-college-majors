8118705,4,B000F7GCUU,"155 minutes -- All three volumes of Joe Carr's 1995 ""Complete Country Guitar"" lessons are now available on DVD. Volume one covers major chords, scales, Nashville numbering system, 1-4-5 progressions, and picking techniques. For the latter, Joe quickly demonstrates upstrokes, downstrokes, alternating pick direction, plucking strings all at once, popping (or chicken pickin'). Volume two addresses harmonized scales, turnarounds, pentatonic scales, and new chords and endings. Volume three introduces more intermediate techniques such as string bends, pedal steel intros and endings, Chuck Berry rockabilly sounds for leads, and special effects (volume swells, harmonics, and using the echoplex with 1-second delay in the style of Albert Lee). Unlike some other instructional material that shows views of both right- and left hands, this DVD focuses on one or the other. Carr's is particularly effective in teaching licks and patterns, something of great use to guitarists who desire to go beyond just techniques. His approach no doubt stems from over two decades as a successful music instructor at South Plains College in Levelland, Tx., as well as his authoring over 20 books or videos for Mel Bay Publishing about playing guitar, mandolin, ukelele, fiddle or banjo.

""Complete Country Guitar"" is an ambitious project that covers many bases in less than three hours. Fundamentals of chords, scales, and flatpicking techniques are essential. However, it's also nice that attention is given to implementation and application of the ideas with rhythm and charts to play along with. This lesson gets high marks for introducing pedal steel licks, special effects, and various country lead guitar styles. Of course, each of these topics could be an entire DVD lesson of its own so Joe barely scratches the surface. But he does stimulate considerable curiosity about them for further exploration.
