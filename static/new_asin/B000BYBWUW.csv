8094250,5,B000BYBWUW,"I have been practicing Witchcraft & the Occult for over 35 years. I have had a particular interest in A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) Mechanical, Automated Fortune Telling apparatus. This particular device (the DVD) is awesome & worthy of further study. I am extremely happy with the automated response & hope further research will make ""android"" type apparatus like this even more effective as a valid and important step in Occult Science. Blessed Be!",1287273600,2,451,5.277777777777778
8094251,1,B000BYBWUW,"I have been a tarot reader for more than five years and to be really effective in readings one must study the cards and all the correspondences, such as astrology, numerology, etc.  The information in this video is simplistic a best and certainly doesn't provide any insight.  Where it might be fun for a child's party, if you are planning to use the information for awareness raising, I suggest you buy a magic eight ball.  The answers you get will be more on topic.

8094252,5,B000BYBWUW,"This is a professionally produced DVD with very easy to use features. Randomly chosen tarot cards create different combinations with each reading. Interpretations of tarot cards were clear and concise. The crystal ball is more fun than the old magic 8 ball. The psychic test using 8 common symbols is a good exercise for intuitive/psychic development. See if you can figure out the card trick, it is a trick I won't give away!",1150070400,13,426,4.8493150684931505
8094253,5,B000BYBWUW,"This DVD is feature packed, it's a lot of fun to learn about Tarot as the DVD give you as many readings as you like, and yeah!.. Somehow they have figured out how make a DVD do ""real"" individual Tarot readings! The additional features like the crystal ball and spirit board are fun too! ( kinda like the magic eight ball.. at the very least, good for a laugh with friends ) The extra features section has two games that are quite mind blowing.. A great card trick that I can't begin to figure out, it really reads you mind! And a ""sixth sense"" type card guessing game that is fun to play with groups of friends. Overall, a great buy, and loads of fun! (cool music too!)",1131062400,13,669,4.234375
