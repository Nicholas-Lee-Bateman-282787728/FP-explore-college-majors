8683362,4,B00OFHXP5G,"Good movie but not as engaging at Iron Man 1 and 2. It had all the right combination of special effects and sonic fireworks. But the story seemed a bit contrived, as if the writers were stretching hard to make it work. Reminds me of how the Transformers franchise began by dazzling us then over time began to lose its luster and uniqueness.",1526601600,,340,4.412698412698413
8683363,5,B00OFHXP5G,3D movies are WAY fun! Brings me back to the 70s when I was a young kid & they were shown in theaters as a novelty. I hope they keep making them bigger & better. Also hoping they keep re-releasing old 3D movies on BluRay with new transfers!  Yay for 3D!!!!,1523577600,2,256,4.019607843137255
8683364,1,B00OFHXP5G,Look I'm a fan of RDJ Iron Man and the MCU. The first movie was amazing and blew my mind when it came out. The second Iron Man was mediocre but somewhat watchable at least but Iron Man 3 is a gigantic mess. A poorly written storyline that contains the worst plot twist (Mandrian Reveal) I have ever seen in the movie. The characters are overall handled terribly to the point where the movie feels like a big joke. Speaking of jokes there are so many forced on bad jokes that get shoehorned into this movie to the point it is cringe-worthy. The final act was a big CGI catastrophe that was completely pointless and dumb (Don't even get me started on Peppers turning into the human torch like thing). Robert Downey Jr. is the only saving grace in this movie. He is really the only good aspect of this movie. But overall he is not enough to save this movie. If you buy this movie and are disappointed well don't say I didn't warn you.,1519948800,7,931,4.295454545454546

Surprisingly, this was my favorite of the three Iron Man films. It has been criticized for logic holes, obvious twists and other sins, and those are fair charges. Yet in some ways this installment brings the best of the first two films together and adds something more.

For me, this had the strongest balance of humor and seriousness. The first film leaned a bit towards a self-serious edge, and the second felt almost like a flat out comedy with action sequences grafted in. But here the flow all works, and the humor almost always comes out of the characters. Also, this had by far the best action sequences of the three films. Even knowing how things will work out, my palms were sweaty for much of the lengthy climax, and the stunts mesh seamlessly with the visual effects to put you inside the ride, instead of standing back.

Last, on a character level, theres a humanity and melancholy to this edition of the story. Tonys enemy is ultimately as much himself - his own flaws and fears, as the outside world. That's something hinted at in the first two films, but brought to the surface here. Theres a desperation under Downeys still very funny shtick that gives it more layers of meaning. Im not saying its Bergman, but this was definitely the most emotionally engaging of the films for me.

Again, I cant fight those who point to the weak spots. A couple of cheats had me almost groaning out loud. But that was because I was pulled in and involved on a pretty intense level. BTW this has by far the best after credits throw in as well.",1457136000,2,1643,4.518518518518518
