8497864,3,B006GVO8AA,The case came damaged and the dvds were loose. When I opened it swat was scratched beyond belief. I'm going to try and buff the disc to see if it helps. Still gave three stars as I ordered it for Formula 51 which was undamaged.,1515542400,,227,4.066666666666666

8497869,5,B006GVO8AA,Awesome movie bundle!!!  I wanted Formula 51 mainly but having Basic in there was excellent!  SWAT was a cool bonus also.  I highly recommend this movie bundle if you're a fan of Samuel L. Jackson.,1482364800,,197,4.571428571428571
8497870,5,B006GVO8AA,I bought this as the cheapest way to get Formula 51 which was more expensive on its own! Love Sam Jackson and F51 is one of his best! Basic was OK but S.W.A.T. was T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E.!! LOL,1482278400,,186,4.194444444444445
