Edo is so beautifully filmed in a soft golden hue, while modern day Tokyo is cold, in shades of grey, and it's full of vibrant characters you will love.  How women ever got their work done walking like penguins in those awkward shoes, is a mystery.
The chemistry between Saki and the doctor is awesome.  It's so sad when a couple so gentle, adore each other, but due to life choices and the rigid mindset of Edo society, well, you have to live with those consequences - I just wanted to take an erazer and remove all their sadness - they were just so perfect for each other.
The kind and oh so gentle doctor (Takao Osawa - OK I know he is no Jin Akanishi) but his face just grows and grows and grows on you, he is just so loving with his infectious smile and benevolent nature, just radiating service to others and who is so confused and at odds to what choices to make.
The beautiful Saki (Haruka Ayase) who loves the doctor so, is so delicate, like a porcelain doll with the presence of a surreal being from another planet or perhaps like a fragile peony blossom, she just radiates such purity.
To sum it up, and I quote from the Drama:-
""I would like to become snow, if I became snow, I would rest on his (the doctor's) shoulder at any time, couldn't I"" ...SO SAD!",1463961600,,1350,4.265625
