8417833,5,B00478ED6S,"This early Horror film is a lost treasure, but to really enjoy it you must remember this is all they had back then, so I would say it's pretty good for a silent movie from 1926, the effects and the photography look exactly like vintage photos from the era, almost a ghostly appearance, when your watching it you can kind of feel like going back in time. This is more for the connoisseur of old time movies, a person that understands the early style.",1491350400,,449,4.357142857142857

8417835,4,B00478ED6S,"The formidable combination of director Rex Ingram, author Somerset Maugham, Ivan Petrovich with Alice Terry and Paul Wegener gave this horror film a distinction of having several international stars. But the script contains occult practices, hypnotism, a spinal operation, and a sinister experiment at a Monte Carlo tower which would have suited a horror specialist better than it did for director Ingram. Nevertheless the star of the film, Alice Terry shines as a woman whose real love is for the surgeon who saved her life (Petrovich), and finally gets saved from the sinister hypnotist played Paul Wegener.",1455494400,,609,5.288659793814433
8417836,4,B00478ED6S,"Like another reviewer, I first became familiar with Rex Ingram's THE MAGICIAN through Carlos Clarens' book AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE HORROR FILM back in the late 1960s. A few years later it was one of the films/stories selected by Peter Haining in his fascinating 1971 collection THE GHOULS which featured the source material that some classic horror films were based on. Both publications indicated that THE MAGICIAN was a lost film or at best incomplete. Unlike a number of other silent films that I successfully tracked down after the VHS/DVD explosion of the late 1980s and early 90s, I totally forgot about THE MAGICIAN assuming that it was a lost cause. Then in 2010 this Warner Archive Edition appeared out of nowhere  and I finally got to see it after some 40 odd years in a good print and with a proper soundtrack . Silent film lovers owe a huge debt to Turner Classic Movies. Not only do they give a large audience a chance to experience silent movies through their SILENT SUNDAY NIGHTS program but they have made these films available to purchase on DVD-R.

It's fascinating to see how many horror films borrowed their backgrounds from this film most notably, as has been mentioned before, James Whale's original FRANKENSTEIN. This gives the viewer, especially in the film's final scenes, a strong sense of deja vu since it looks so familiar but then THE MAGICIAN got there first. Director Rex Ingram was a major visual stylist of the silent era. He moved to France to get away from Hollywood control (THE MAGICIAN was shot in France and on location) and especially Louis B. Mayer whom he despised (notice that Mayer's name is pointedly missing from the title credits). When sound arrived, Ingram's career waned. He didin't care much for sound and Mayer reportedly worked behind the scenes to keep his movies from being distributed. I find it interesting that Ingram (an Irishman) shooting in France for an American company not known for its horror films should come up with such a German looking picture as THE MAGICIAN. I suspect that star Paul Wegener, famous for playing THE GOLEM and a director as well, had a hand in the proceedings.

THE MAGICIAN was inspired by W. Somerset Maugham's 1908 novel which was inspired by the English occult practitioner, Aleister Crowley. The film is set in contemporary 1926. When sculptor Alice Terry (director Ingram's wife and a popular star of the silent era) is injured by a falling statue, she is saved by the ""miracle"" surgery of an American (!) doctor. Attending the surgery is magician Oliver Haddo (Wegener) who is obsessed with a medieval formula for creating life. It requires the ""heart blood of a maiden"" and guess who he has in mind. After hypnotizing Terry and transforming her statue of a faun into a vision of Hell (one of the film's great set-pieces), he whisks her away to his tower/laboratory to conduct his experiments with the doctor in hot pursuit. If this sounds like high melodrama, it is but intentionally so. A title card even refers to Wegener as a character out of a melodrama. It's all style over substance and a must for fans of classic, old school horror. WARNING: Beware of public domain prints like the one currently on You Tube. It has an unrelated soundtrack and no color tints.",1439164800,2,3268,4.790780141843972
8417837,5,B00478ED6S,"The Magician is one of the masterpieces of silent horror cinema, on a par with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919) Nosferatu  (1923) and Jean Epsteins Fall of the House of Usher (1928). Its quality draws from its plot, cast, and superior direction, linked with an almost Expressionistic art design, all of which were noted by earlier reviewers, so I won't explore them further.

The film has a long and tortuous history. I first came across it in 1967, when Carlos Clarenss pioneering book, An Illustrated History of the Horror Film, was published. Clarenss evocative still from the film, showing  Paul Wegener in his alchemists lab, whetted my teenage appetite. But this was long before the days of cable or home video, and the few network channels that existed did not show silent films, evidently deeming them of scant commercial value.

Lacking alternatives, I waited many years to see The Magician, only to discover that the sole archival print was locked up in a vault at The Museum of Modern Art. Out of frustration, therefore, I tracked down a bootleg copy with terrible resolution (but an excellent music score) from a former projectionist named Peter Kavel.

When you finally see a great film in such poor condition, however, a certain petulance sets in. As time rolled by I tried to interest an independent company, Kino-on-Video, into making this film available to the public. Kino had already issued a number of silent horror films on VHS and DVD, but they presumably lacked the resources to obtain The Magician (the leasing price must have been exorbitant).

So it was left, I assume, to the deeper pockets at Turner Classic Movies to obtain legal rights to this film, for their logo appears before the discs opening credits. Whatever the story may be, Im most grateful for this beautiful archive edition.

At the risk of critical redundancy, I think the influence of The Magician on the 1931 Frankenstein should be emphasized, for James Whale obviously admired this film. Its true that Wegeners 1920 version of The Golem can also be cited as precursor (especially the scene where a little girl approaches the creature in a town square), but the 1926 film had a much more direct impact. Four elements in the last quarter-hour come particularly to mind. First, multiple shots of the medieval castle on a mountaintop as the lightning flashes fitfully in a storm. Second, interior scenes showing Wegener bent over his test tubes and alembics while preparing new laboratory life. Third, the magicians dwarf assistant (clear inspiration for  the Dwight Frye character in Whales film) ambling down a stairway to admit three people to the castle. And finally, theres Alice Terry strapped to what looks like a hospital gurney ---  if one substitutes Boris Karloff for  Terry, this and the previous scenes comprise the core ingredients of Frankenstein.

Id comment on just one additional matter, and that is the music score. In this respect I differ with a former reviewer, for I believe the Robert Israel score is misguided and fails to do the film justice. For one thing, I would estimate that at least 50 percent of the score is not by Israel at all. It starts with the same snippets from Tchaikovskys Swan Lake that open both the 1931 Dracula and the 1932 The Mummy  why go through this a third time? Much of the balance of the film, moreover, consists of musical borrowings from The Werewolf of London (1935) and stock music already used in many other silent films. Then, too, the comparatively little original music by Israel himself is undistinguished. By contrast, the music on the Peter Kavel copy released two decades ago was a beautifully synchronized score that made liberal use of oboe and piano, and was better attuned to the unique character of the various scenes than the music used here. I would hope that in future The Magician is issued yet again with a better choice of score, as well as a feature-length commentary track that would highlight this films intrinsic and historical importance. Otherwise, this edition makes for a revelatory experience and is essential for any true collector of silent horror cinema.",1390780800,7,4137,4.911174785100287

8417839,4,B00478ED6S,"The Magician is a high quality silent film with a high-profile cast and crew, and a story that has been retold in many ways throughout the decades.  The film is based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1908 novel by the same name, which he based on the British occultist, Aleister Crowley, and although the subject of ancient black magic may not be as popular or fascinating to modern audiences as it was in the early decades of last century, this film is still quite gripping and thoroughly entertaining.
Veteran German actor, Paul Wegener, who already featured in some earlier horror films such as The Golem (1920) and The Student of Prague (1913), is perfect in the role of Oliver Haddo, the magician obsessed with creating new human life by means of alchemy and ancient magic.  When the formula for such magic calls for the heart of a blonde and blue-eyed virgin, he plots the process of abducting such a young woman by means of hypnotism and mind control.  The story is very reminiscent of the character, Svengali, who featured in an excellent early silent film, Trilby (1915) by Maurice Tourneur, and who was played by John Barrymore in the early sound film, Svengali (1931).
The young woman in question is played by Alice Terry, who starred in several outstanding productions in the 1920s, co-starring in some with silent screen legend, Rudolph Valentino, and often directed by Rex Ingram, who adapted this story for the screen and supervised the direction.  This combination of skills and talent makes The Magician more than just a horror movie or average silent film, which is evident in the quality sets and charming street scenes of Paris, as well as the romance between the girl, Margaret, and the surgeon who saves her from being a cripple and then falls in love with her.
The film itself is in very good condition, and features some appropriate red tinting in several scenes of fire and hell.  But the final touch that greatly enhances this film is the musical score by Robert Israel, who combines well-known classical pieces to produce a range of moods that are perfectly suited to the action and drama of the film.",1313625600,7,2120,4.781420765027322
8417840,4,B00478ED6S,"W. Somerset Maugham's famous ""The Magician"" was crafted into a now obscure silent thriller by MGM in 1926. Produced and directed by Rex Ingram, who made Valentino a star, ""The Magician"" is now officially available from Warner Archives on DVD. Paul Wegener plays Oliver Haddo, a Parisian medical student obsessed with magic and the creation of life. Haddo discovers a beautiful subject for his experiments in young sculptor Margaret Dauncey(Alice Terry, Ingram's wife). Margaret is injured while fashioning a large faun sculpture; the edifice mysteriously cracks, and tumbles down on top of her, crushing her to the ground. Her uncle Dr. Porhoet rushes her into surgery, assisted by physician Arthur Burdon, a handsome young doctor. In the open operating theater,Haddo lays his eyes on Margaret for the first time. Haddo sneers and declares ""true medical genius resides in the mastery of magic; the creation of life.""Later, Haddo finds the arcane secret formula for creating life in a dusty old book of magic. A heart must be plucked from the breast of a young virgin. Soon, Haddo is invading Margaret's home, hypnotizing her with visions of Hell. In a clearly ""Mock-Hell"" recreation, an Ingram masterpiece, Margaret is seduced by a near-naked Pan(Hubert Stowitts); dancing nymphs, swirling winds, and eerie smoke surround the couple. Just behind them is Haddo. Smirking, his hair is slicked-up neatly into two twin ""horns"". Haddo spirits the girl away, and in a trance, marries her. Dr. Burdon and Porhoet follow them to Monte Carlo(filmed on location). Finally, they follow Haddo and his bride to the village of Latourette, where Haddo's towering castle is guarded by his evil dwarf servant. Her uncle and her lover must brave a dark, stormy night, attack the castle, and stop Haddo from completing his dark mission, an operation of death. It is said that, five years later, director James Whale studied these final castle scenes brfore shooting his sequences for ""Frankenstein"". It is but one of several well-composed, carefully framed shots, some filmed in Nice, Paris, and Monte Carlo. The charismatic Paul Wegener was a German actor and film director. His only Hollywood movie was ""The Magician(filmed in Nice)"". In Germany, Wegener starred in three versions of ""The Golem"". All but one(the last) are lost. In 1928, Wegener starred with Brigitte Helm in the fantasy ""Alraune"". In ""Alraune"", Helm is spell-binding and beautiful. The movie is hard to find. Paul Wegener was married six times, and died in Berlin in 1948. One of Wegener's early films was absorbed with trick photography and magic: ""Der Yoghi(1916)"", or ""The Buddha"". It's long been considered lost, but you can see the only remaining fragments of ""The Buddha"" on You-Tube. It is in color, and lasts only 5 1/2 minutes.",1295049600,12,2787,5.140969162995595
