8302454,5,B001FRNB7G,"Stax - Respect Yourself

I missed getting the 90-minute documentary ""Respect Yourself"" on the history of the Memphis-based Stax label when it came out last year - though I did see it air on TV. I really wanted to see the separate 90-minute DVD of the ""Stax Volt Revue in Norway 1967"" even more, but just never got to it. Now, thanks to Infinity Entertainment Group, BOTH these incredible shows are in one package - simply titled ""Stax"".

Both of the programs were produced by David Peck and his Reelin' In The Years Production company, which searches Europe for some of the rarest television footage of American pop, blues and jazz performances. (If it says ""Reelin' in The Years"" on a DVD package you can be sure it's essential viewing!).

While the documentary is one that you'll probably only watch once all the way through, you might return to favorite chapters. The ""Stax Volt Revue"", however, is one you will turn to again and again. Who can tire of watching Otis Redding turn on a crowd of conservative Norwegian teens? Or count the number of times that Sam & Dave end their number, leave the stage and then return again to finish, and finish, and - finally - finish their song (a la James Brown). Add the Mar-key-s with Steve Cropper as the show's Musical Director, Arthur Conley, Eddie Floyd and Booker T and you have one heck of dynamite show.

Then the producers added an audio commentary and interviews to put the tour in perspective and you have well over three hours of class entertainment (between the two discs in the set). And the 28 page color booklet of notes and photos adds to the ""class act"".

This is one DVD that will not just sit on your shelf. To my knowledge the Stax Volt tour was never filmed in the US. We can only wait till Peck and his company dig up footage of the tour in other European countries. Till then, grab the DVD, It certainly has ""soul""!
