3566280,5,B001F9FHDU,"I've always been a music fanatic. For some reason I always seem to have music on no matter what. In the car, in the house, mp2 player, they're always up and running. I've collected music on vinyl, tape, disc and now online. And I've never limited myself to one form or another. Country, rock,  r & b, jazz, soul, classic. I love them all.

An appreciation and love of music is not something you can force on someone. You either have it or you don't. You can be led to it, but to feel it rooted deep in your soul is another matter. Those roots can be covered over, buried deep by the problems of day to day life. If you can find a hook to dig deep and find those roots, you'd be amazed at the joyous feelings they can inspire.

I think that this was the basis for a new series showcased on DVD this week with the release of LIVE FROM ABBEY ROAD. The studio made famous by the Beatles back in the sixties (and which they used for an album title) is used to its full effect here.

As the box states ""The concept for LIVE FROM ABBEY ROAD is simple...capture fantastic, live, musical performances and place musicians in the world's most inspiring and creative environment in which to do so"". Yes, it may sound simple, but the concept works and the performances are stellar.

The idea that someone could come up with a tune, a melody, harmonization, instrumentals, vocals and more is amazing in itself. To find a group of talented individuals willing to perform live in this studio is to help cultivate an appreciation for all that they do.

No musical scene is left untouched here. Country? LeAnn Rimes. Jazz? Wynton Marsalis. Pop? John Mayer. Progressive rock? David Gilmour. Metal? Iron Maiden. Not just these but a whole slew of other bands and performers as well.

One of the nice things about this series is that it not only takes the performers and highlights them performing familiar or non-familiar tunes, it gives them a chance to talk about the creative process as well. To hear someone like David Gilmour of Pink Floyd fame discuss how he saved ideas for up to ten years and then sorted through them to find the ones that were worth turning into songs gives new depth to those tunes, here in particular ""On An Island"".

All of the artists featured here give glimpses into the way they put together ideas and songs. And then they offer up a tune performed live in the studio. The sound is magnificent as it well should be considering the location. And the performances have a more intimate feel to them than they would on a massive stage.

The DVD is a two disc set. On disc one are featured John Mayer, Corinne Bailey Rae, Dr. John, Craig David, Damien Rice, LeAnn Rimes, Josh Groban,. Natasha Bedingfield, Wynton Marsalis, Nerina Pallot, Jamiroquai, Ray LaMontagne, Gipsy Kings and Norah Jones. Disc two has David Gilmour, The Good The Bad & The Queen, The Kooks, Gnarls Barkley, The Goo Goo Dolls, Iron Maiden, Kasabian, Primal Scream, The Zutons, Dave Matthews and Amos Lee.

For those with no interest in music you might change your mind after listening. For those with a passing interest in music you might find something here to spur you on to listen even more and search out these artists. And for music fanatics like me, you'll want to make sure that the stereo system is hooked into the DVD player to get the best sound imaginable.

This DVD is not something that the true music fan will want to simply rent. This is one to add to the collection. BCI has released a great disc for fans that is not to be missed.",1226361600,19,3526,4.485179407176287
3566281,3,B001F9FHDU,"I purchased this and thought that I would get the full performance from each artist.  I was definitely wrong.  You get one performance and a short interview with each artist.  The video and audio quality is awesome but if you are hoping to get all performances then you will be disappointed as well.  Would love to find a full box set with all performances, or the possibility to download/buy a full performance by artist and create a collection.  I would wait to see if either becomes available before buying this set.",1267747200,13,519,4.65934065934066
3566282,4,B001F9FHDU,"This collection Is pretty scattered as far as the performers go, but some are complete standouts. You can't get anywhere else.
This DVD Is well worth buying If you can find a copy anymore.
ESPECIALLY on Blu Ray",1252713600,,210,4.552631578947368
3566283,4,B001F9FHDU,"This will be re-released on 11/11/09 - if you can wait until then you won't have to buy from the scalpers listed here.
Edited 1-23-10 UPDATE - Looks like the rerelease isn't going to happen.:(
2-17-10 Yay! the blu-ray has been rereleased - $19.99 at Newberry Comics!!!!!!",1252108800,5,271,4.787234042553192
3566284,5,B001F9FHDU,"I love this show.  It always has a very interesting mix of artists and the interviews are fascinating.  There are three guests in each episode, usually an artsy one, an unknown indie, and a big name artist.  I have found several new favorite bands and singers watching this series, especially feeding my love of all things British.  The best part for a true music junkie, its actually LIVE!  The auto-tuners and jackasses who owe their careers to studio magic, slick marketing, and barely there wardrobes would never dream of being on this show for fear of being exposed for the posers they are. (And, yes, I'm looking at you Britney)",1251936000,,634,4.7272727272727275
3566285,3,B001F9FHDU,"Live from Abbey Road is a popular music TV show in the UK, showcasing artists perform live in the famous Abbey Road studios (at one point Johnny Rzeznik points to a microphone, and almost drools ""This is the microphone that John Lennon sang into!""). This DVD collection brings the best of the program's first season.

""Live From Abbey Road: Best of Season One"" (2 DVDs; 200 min.) brings a wealth of performances and interviews. DVD 1 (80 min.) is not all that interesting to me but for a couple of artists. Damien Rice brings a beautiful performance of ""9 Crimes"" along with Lisa Hannigan (I can only hope these two will get together again to make music). Dr. John remains a strong performer after all these years. Norah Jones and her band bring an okay ""Thinkin' About You"" but she really needs to widen her musical landscape and get away from the formulaic semi-jazzy songs. Lots of other artists on DVD 1 that I just don't care for (Craig David, LeAnn Rimes, Josh Groban, Natasha Bedingfield, among many others). I rate DVD 1 just 2 stars. DVD 2 is much more enjoyable for me, due to the line-up of the artists: The Kooks bring a great performance of ""Naive"", The Goo Goo Dolls are good on ""Iris"", Kasabian blaze through ""Shoot The Runner"", The Zutons bring their hit ""Valerie"", Dave Matthews brings ""American Baby"" solo on acoustic guitar, etc. The second DVD also brings 50+ min. of additional interviews (check out John Mayer's response to the interviewer asking him ""who is John Mayer?"") and other behind the scenes. I rate the second DVD a strong 4 stars.

The sound quality on here is nothing short of spectectular, in particular if you have the proper home theatre system set-up (which I happen to have). Play it loud! Most of the time, the editing is quite good, generally staying away from changing camera angles every 2 seconds so that you can actually watch and enjoy the performers (one major exception is on the Kasabian performance, with almost migraine-inducing MTV-style editing). In all, this is a pick-and-choose affair, but when it's on, it's really on.",1247961600,,2075,4.7292817679558015
3566286,4,B001F9FHDU,"Very nice collection of artists. A little bit of everything for nearly everyone's taste in music. It's too bad Dave Mathews had to get political. All the other artists talk about music in their interviews. This dvd is about music, not politics.

It would be nice to have an option to play just the songs without the interviews. Once you've seen the interiews, there's no need to watch them again before every performance.",1246406400,,421,4.767123287671233
3566287,5,B001F9FHDU,"Live from Abbey Road is a fantastic sampling of music from all genres of the musical world. This two disc DVD set features artists such as John Mayer, Josh Groban, Corrine Bailey Rae, Damien Rice, Dave Matthews, Jamiroquai, Iron Maiden, and many more.
  This musical compilation gives you a brief close up interview with each artist, then gives you a taste of their musical style as you watch them play a live version of one of their songs. Live from Abbey Road is a terrific way for someone to find out about an artist or style that they've never experienced before. I got the DVD originally because there were one or two artists on it whom I liked. however, after watching the DVD in its entirety, I ended up thoroughly enjoying the music of many artists I had never heard of before. It is a great DVD for music enthusiasts who enjoy variety.",1235174400,3,844,4.509803921568627
3566288,4,B001F9FHDU,"The first set is a good mix of pop/rock/jazz whilst the second set is more heavy metal in nature, and will suit most genres. Colin Bailey Ray never sounded so good before and the raw energy of Gypsy Kings came through prestinely. David Gilmore sounded really good here. The recording is first class all the way and would be an excellent audiophile showpiece. The vocals and musical instruments are very well recorded. The video recording is good and colour rendition is excellent in it's 1080i presentation. A must have for all the audiophiles.",1234656000,,544,4.860215053763441
3566289,1,B001F9FHDU,This is one of my favorite shows.  It's amazing to see and hear such an eclectic variety of artists perform in the Abbey Road studios.  But why can't they give us the whole season?  This disc sucks because it's not complete.,1232928000,9,224,4.414634146341464

8301339,5,B001F9FHDU,"I love everything about this bluray.  The best of the best of the best of the best.  Seasons, performers, performances, music series.

They even shortened the interviews.  I don't hate them anyway, they reset the stage for each artist opposed to a constant assault of unrelated styles.",1502928000,,285,5.0

8301344,5,B001F9FHDU,"I bought this blu-ray for test my new pair of B&W 685 S2 speakers and I'm surprised with audio and video quality. The big diference about is because it was recorded in studio and not on a stage, as live concerts with ambience. In this disk you can listen the performance of many artists with many diferent instuments, so if you have a quality sound system, don`t waste your time, buy it ! Please pay attention for audio formats dolby true hd 5.1 and dts-hd 5.1, but this disk have a big negative point, all performances begin with an interview, it`s so boring because you have to use FF (fast-foward) to go to point of music start.",1411776000,,631,4.401709401709402

8301346,3,B001F9FHDU,"It is a very obscure thing to me why we care about what singers, actors, soccer players, basquetball players, etc. have to say about things different of their spectrum of work&art. Irated this 3 starts just because of that. I was expecting more music and less chit chat.

Other than that, the recordings are stupendous.",1400457600,,319,4.8

8301348,4,B001F9FHDU,"I purchased the two-disc set without knowing anything about the ""Live From Abbey Road"" series, being from this side of the pond.
I had seen a clip or two online and wanted to see more, so I ordered the set. I did not realize that there was only one song for each artist, so that was disappointing at first, but I really enjoyed the ""behind the scenes"" feel of the presentation. The video is every bit as choreographed and polished as any music video, but with a more intimate feel. Sometimes it feels as though you are a ""fly on the wall"", invisibly enjoying being there with these incredible musicians.
I didn't love every clip - there was a wide variety of music - but I really enjoyed the whole experience. The highlights for me were Jamiroquai and Corinne Bailey Rae, but there were a lot of great performances.",1290470400,,815,4.476510067114094
