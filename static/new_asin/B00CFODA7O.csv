5721641,5,B00CFODA7O,"Writer/director Kenji Uchida's newest film, KEY OF LIFE, is a crisply written, adroitly directed, beautifully acted little story that is a comedy on the surface, but does not fail to show the other side of the infamous masks of comedy/tragedy. Though it is long (in excess of two hours) the story is presented in such a fine overlapping episodic way that it seems to whiz by to the final moments.

The film opens with a business meeting in which we meet Kanae (Ryko Hirosue), a 34-year-old magazine editor who announces boldly that she is getting married in two months. Without a candidate for a husband she engages the help of her fellow workers to help her search for the right man during a rather narrow time frame. We next meet Sakuari (Masato Sakai), a 35-year-old aspiring actor who is jobless, living in squalor, and has just failed a suicide attempt. Then we meet Kondo (Teroyuki Kagawa), a wealthy successful hit man carrying out his latest hit. After their simultaneously acts Sakurai and Kondo end up going to the same public bathhouse: Kondo slips on a bar of soap, sustains a concussion, is taken to a hospital where he discovers he has complete amnesia. The somewhat desperate Sakuari switches locker keys, and in effect switches identities with Kondo, of course not realizing that he is stepping into the identity of a hit man. Kanae visits the hospital where her father (who expects his daughter to marry soon) is gravely ill - the same hospital where Kondo is recovering. Fate is such that the two meet. How a failed actor takes on the role of a hit man without much success, and a hit man gains employment as an actor who can convincingly play gangster parts, and how the lovesick Kanae connects with Kondo and helps him try to regain his memory forms the rush to the surprise ending of the story.

There is enough social commentary on relationships and what is love, what is acting, and what is ethical that makes this little film gleam. It is an excellent film from Film Movement and should enjoy success in the art houses. It is a breath of fresh air from the current clutter of over the edge CGI `dramas'!

His locker tag is found by the actor who decides to try his luck. After all, the grass is always greener in someone else's backyard.  The hit man suffers a case of amnesia and assumes the actor's life.  What ensues is a very rewarding comedy acted in supreme dead pan style.  Director Kenji Uchida has given us a future classic.  One of the best comedies I have seen in years. NOT TO BE MISSED!",1379462400,,527,4.316326530612245
5721644,4,B00CFODA7O,"I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies. In fact, I am a member of their DVD-of-the-Month club and this is the August, 2013 release in that on-going series.

""Key of Life"" (2012 release from Japan; 128 min.) brings the story of 3 people and how their lives unexpectedly become intertwined. As the movie opens, we meet Kanae, a 34 yr. old magazine editor who announces boldly that she is getting married in two months. The only problem left to solve is to find a suitable candidate-husband... Afterwards we meet Takeshi, a 35 yr. old aspiring actor who is down on his luck and we just saw failing miserably when he tried to commit suicide. Last we meet Kondo, a ruthless hit man whom we see carrying out his latest hit. Takeshi and Kondo end up going to the same public bathhouse, and when Kondo slips on a soap bar, he hits his head very hard, and loses all memory. In an impulse, Takeshi switches locker keys, and in effect switches identities with Kondo, of course not realizing that he is stepping into the identity of a hit man. Kanae visits the hospital where her father is gravely ill, and where Kondo is recovering. Fate is such that the two meet. To tell you much more of this plot-heavy movie would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: even though it tackles a lot of serious issues, this movie is first and foremost a comedy, and at very funny one at that. I found myself laughing out loud a number of times during the movie. Second, with the two lead male roles switching identities, I couldn't help but be reminded of that movie from now 30 (!) years ago, ""Trading Places"" with Eddie Murphy and Dan Ackroyd. ""Key of Life"" indeed feels like a Japanese variation of the same theme. Third, kudos to writer-director Kenji Uchida who pulls it all together very nicely, with a perfect cast including the delightful (and beautiful) Ryko Hirosue in the role of Kanae. This movie has a lot going for it, and kept me entertained from start to finish. But wait! there is more! As usual, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this month's shortie is an equally entertaining 8 min. feature from Hungary called ""Finale"" in which we get to know two guys sitting at a bar. What are they discussing? Just watch!

Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that I guarantee will make you smile if not out-loud laugh, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Key of Life"" is a welcome addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377993600,8,2594,4.514893617021277

The intersection begins when the hit man stops by a public bath to wash off some of the blood on his hand. The actor happens to be there also.

2012

Film = four (4) stars; script = 4.5 stars. Director Kenji Uchida (who also wrote the screenplay)  serves up a hugely-inventive, hilarious story (actually multiple stories that converge into one) with stunning (and unexpected) plot twists about trading places by adults (not necessarily grown ups).  Things usually turn out to be not as they initially seem.  Principal characters include: an apparent contract killer (with an unique body disposal technique); a successful business woman (determined to apply a business model to the process of matrimony with formal vetting of candidate partners, milestones, progress reports, etc.); and a lay-about, good-for-nothing ""actor"" (sort of contemplating suicide as his final [and, to date, only] role).  There is a feel-good, Hollywood-style happy ending for each (as well as for a neko with a walk-on cameo).  One ending includes an unexplained car crash (an amusing context injudiciously edited out and/or not reshot?).  The Director has set a hectic pace that makes the viewer wonder just where the two hours of movie time went!  There are, however, a few hammy gimmicks (including an overly Japanese-cute one using the sound of a car alarm).  The Director extracts Goldilocks (just-right) acting performances all round in part by keeping dialog realistic and to a minimum (screaming, sobbing, melodramatic scenery eating, and other typical [and tedious] forms of movie emoting have been banished).  Cinematography (semi wide screen, color) is very good with consistent scene lighting and color that makes for near seamless editing.  Subtitles are very well done (by a pro who really seems to understands Japanese and English grammar).  A delightful gem!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1450569600,,1909,5.482876712328767

5721674,3,B00CFODA7O,"Although the movie starts slowly, a clever twist toward the end saved the movie.

Unfortunately, neither myself nor the family members gathered to watch the movie speak Japanese, so the absence of subtitles renders this version of the film  incomprehensible to its disappointed English speaking audience.

5721689,4,B00CFODA7O,"Key of Life is from director Kenji Uchida. This Japanese film was an official selection of TIFF and over fifteen others.

Kanae (Ryko Hirosue) is a successful magazine editor. She happily announces at work one day that she is getting married - she just hasn't selected the groom yet....Kondo (Teruyuki Kagawa) is a contract killer who decides he needs to use the public bath after his latest mission - it got a bit messy....Sakurai (Masato Sakai) is a down on his luck actor at the end of his rope - literally. After a failed suicide attempt he too heads for the public baths....

.....where he steals Kondo's identity after the hitman falls and blacks out. When Kondo awakes, he has amnesia. Presented with Sakurai's papers, he assumes the actor's life. And then Kanae's path crosses with both men.

Key of Life is a comedy of errors as Sakurai slowly comes to realize that the identity he as stolen may be more than he bargained for. And Kondo, unable to remember his past life, seems quite content to pursue his acting career. Kanae seems to be falling in love with one of the men - but has no idea who he really is.

This was a fun movie to watch. There are many comical bits and the mistaken identity twist is played to the max. However there are serious bits to catch too - familial and societal expectations and the pursuit of love.

Of the three actors, I enjoyed Hirosue the most. I thought her role was well played - understated yet moving. Kagawa and Sakai essentially played two roles and two characters each. Of the two, I enjoyed Kagawa's performance more. Sakai seemed a little over the top with his exaggerated facial expressions that simply annoyed me by the end. Now, that being said, he was nominated for best actor at the Japanese Academy Awards for this role. And really, this is a Japanese comedy - everything is a little over the top - at times reminding me of a game show. (the ambulance drivers especially)

There are some fun twists in Key of Life that were unexpected and kept things interesting. And of course, there was the ending I hoped for.

Key of Life was an enjoyable film that was a breath of fresh air and a change from the heavy films I've been watching. 2012 / Japanese with English subtitles / 128 min

Film Movement always includes a short on their DVD's. This entry is ""Finale"" from Hungary. There is no dialogue - instead we are left to puzzle out what these well dressed men are up to - and it's not what you would expect. An excellent little short that paired well with Key of Life.",1389225600,,2527,4.490196078431373
5721690,4,B00CFODA7O,"Key of Life is an oddball Japanese drama and comedy all wrapped into one. Sakurai is at his wits end, broke, an unemployed actor, living in a crappy apartment and unable to even commit suicide with any success. His suicide attempt left him sweaty and smelling so he decides to go to a bath house to clean up. This was an odd scene and it felt a little intrusive watching a room full of naked (albeit properly hidden) Japanese men wash off. However, this is where the story starts to pick up speed - literally! 'Hit man' Kondo slips on a bar of soap and ends up in the hospital with amnesia. Lucky for Sakurai, he switches locker keys before Kondo is removed from the bathhouse and so the two assume each other's lives and all that comes with it. What I found interesting was that Kondo maintains a tidy and strong disposition while he tries to remember his life as Sakurai. It was also interesting that Kondo (as Sakurai) becomes somewhat depressed living under the conditions that were left for him. Sakurai (as Kondo) uses Kondo's ample money to pay off his debts and yet still seems to be depressed and ready to end it all. Eventually, their paths cross again and again and a girl gets in the middle to add a little drama and kindness to it all. I enjoyed the beginning, felt the middle dragged a bit, and really liked the ending. The characters were appealing and likeable. The violence was not too graphic, and the dialogue had humor and wit. Captions were easy to read and not intrusive to the enjoyability of the film.

I was provided a review copy in exchange for an honest review.",1388966400,,1589,4.4604810996563575
5721691,5,B00CFODA7O,"Key of Life starts off with a bang: hitman Kondo, a consummate professional, fulfills a contract with clockwork precision. It's an effective scene, and a surprisingly serious one for a movie dubbed a comedy. But writer-director Kenji Uchida (After School) knows what he's doing; Key of Life is smartly made, with chunks of drama helping reinforce the expertly constructed screwball comedy at the heart of the film.

And it really is a screwball comedy. Key of Life gets a lot of mileage out of the amnesia and swapped identity elements; some of the best moments come from watching middle-aged Kondo trying to pull off that he's a thirty-something slacker. The same goes for guileless doofus Sakurai as he tries to convince grimacing Yakuza that he's an assassin. The movie is a throwback to Golden Age cinema, its ridiculously complex plot there to generate laughs. Uchida really cares about these characters toothey sometimes get the short end of the stick but, like a lot of classic comedies, you just know things will work out for everyone (after the characters grow a little, of course).

One aspect that might not work for audiences, though, is how the movie takes its time. It clocks in at over two hours, with much of this time spent setting certain elements up just so. I thought Key of Life was perfectly paced, but it takes a while to get to some of the best parts. The movie also relies heavily on some elements of Japanese culture. Most of the humor in the film is pretty universal, but some of the best gags rely on a passing familiarity with Japan and might fly over a lot of viewers' heads.

Film Movement's release of Key of Life features a decent 1.78:1 standard definition transfer and good Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and 2.0 stereo tracks. The disc includes several trailers (including one for the featured film), some cast bios, and a lovely short film, ""Finale"" (8 minutes) by Hungarian director Balazs Simonyi.

5721692,5,B00CFODA7O,"When the main actress firmly announces to her coworkers that she is going to be married, but has yet to even start to find a husband, you know this is not an ordinary comedy.  Director Kenji Uchida directs three main characters with a twisting and original storyline.  There is the pragmatic, single professional woman, a failed suicidal actor and a heartless hit-man in a smart and quickly paced film.  With minimal dialogue, the story unwinds in completely unexpected and hilarious ways.  It would be unkind to reveal anything more, other than what is in the film description.  It's just one of those rare films that leaves the viewer wondering what can possibly happen next and how can any of the problems resolve themselves.

Suffice it to say that the three main actors interact in a brilliant and convincing manner that is witty, clever and touching as well.  It's rare to find a film that keeps the pace from start to finish without a touch of excess or moment of sluggishness.  From the moment one of the characters slips on a bar of soap, starting the trilogy of misunderstandings, I didn't stop chuckling.  This is a wonderful and immensely rewarding comedy - one of those gems that come from independent films.",1388707200,3,1221,4.776190476190476
5721693,4,B00CFODA7O,"The Film Movement selection Key of Life (2011), is quirky Japanese drama/comedy that smoothly draws you into an intriguing situation, and then takes you on an amusing little ride.  Directed by Kenji Uchida, the tone remains very light and whimsical, even though the story involves a paid assassin, who is given an assignment he cant refuse.

A businessman named Kudo (Yoshiyoshi Arakawa), hires a hitman named Kondo (Teruyuki Kagawa,&nbsp;,) to kill a rival.  After completing the job, Kondo slips on a bar of soap in a public bath (furo), and winds up in the hospital with amnesia.  Immediately after the accident, a man named Takeshi Sakurai (Masato Sakai), switches locker keys with Kendo, and then takes the mans clothes, wallet, and car.

Kondo awakes in a hospital bed, and is told his name is Sakurai.  Leaving the hospital, he meets Kanae Mizushima (Ryoko Hirosue,&nbsp;), a woman who works in publishing, and takes and interest in his situation.  Kondo tries to recover his memory, and attempts to pursue Sakurais career as an actor.

The real Sakurai, uses Kondos money to pay off his debts, but realizes the deception cant go on for very long.  In Kondos apartment, Sakurai discovers many unusual things, including a pistol, and a cache of cash.  His life gets more complicated when he is brought before Kudo, who believing that he is the assassin he hired, commissions him to also kill Ayako (Yoko Moriguchi), the girlfriend of murdered man.

With a subdued and understated approach not uncommon to Asian cinema, an array of quirky characters, and a number of subplots, Key of Life is a fun watch that keeps you guessing.  Its smartly written, well shot, and features some solid acting performances.  There isn't a lot in the way of action or violence, but director Uchida skillfully delivers some impactful scenes when they are required.

5721694,5,B00CFODA7O,"An over organized young woman executive, a hit man, and a failed actor.  What could possibly bring them together?  In this Japanese film with English subtitles we see an intricate, humorous plot, or rather a series of subplots, that entangle these three lives in the most unlikely of ways.

The film opens with the young executive announcing her upcoming schedule to her employees, including the fact that she intends to get married in a couple of months after she locates a suitable husband.  Next we see the hitman dispatching a victim with ruthless efficiency, then the actor at the point of suicide over his lack of career.  The actor switches places with the hitman after a bizarre accident in a bathhouse.  After that things get really crazy.  Suffice it to say that while it is conceivable to find a mate on a strict time schedule, it is scarcely ever advisable to do so, and while it is possible for a hitman to become an actor, it isn't all that easy to reverse the process.

This is an amusing film with plenty of twists and turns.  While the multiple subplots can be a little difficult to follow at times, in the end the director and actors do a fine job of bringing things to a successful, and satisfactory, conclusion.",1386892800,,1231,4.610091743119266

8581357,5,B00CFODA7O,Not over the top like some Japanese comedies can be. Well acted. A clever script and story. Funny throughout. The switched identity storyline was fun. It has messages it got across in subtle ways.,1509580800,,196,4.794117647058823

8581359,5,B00CFODA7O,"Amazing plot line - amazing characterization. I wasn't expecting much out of this one during the first 15 minutes or so, but as the film goes on and things become more and more intertwined, it really does become a comic masterpiece. The characters unveil their true identities in what I can only describe as a ""Seinfeld-esque"" way - too strange to be anything but life-like. It is witty, fairly fast-paced (for Japanese film), AMAZING music (which plays important roles in the film), and just too funny not to enjoy! Highly recommended!",1500336000,,536,4.9010989010989015
8581360,5,B00CFODA7O,"This movie is a treasure. It's funny and intriguing, and has about 4 simultaneous storylines that entwine in unpredictable ways. Teruyuki Kagawa's performance really sells it as Kondo. He has to convincingly play two (maybe three) completely different ""personalities"" in the course of the film, and his timing for comedy is marvelous. I like Japanese film, language and comedies - my husband who likes none of those things really enjoyed this film too.",1490140800,3,452,5.205479452054795
