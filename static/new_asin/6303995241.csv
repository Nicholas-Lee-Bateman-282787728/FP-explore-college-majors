7858523,5,6303995241,This movie is lackluster video. But still awesome as all get out. And i did. I got right out and told everyone to buy this.,1388707200,,123,3.96
7858524,5,6303995241,"This is slapstick comedy at its best.  I thoroughly enjoyed this presentation of the
outcomes of a friendship that occurs in South Africa in which silliness wins.",1379808000,,162,5.0

7858526,5,6303995241,First time i watched this movie on VHS i laughed so hard tears came out.  It was so funny so original nothing like i had ever seen before.  I will recommend anyone to watch it.,1284508800,,176,4.0
7858527,5,6303995241,"Seriously classic Schuster, perhaps a little too intelligent for the average first-world child, only suitable for viewing by those of you who are a lot more broad-minded and open to other cultures than the average  Pom.",944524800,5,219,5.083333333333333
7858528,4,6303995241,I bought the movie online from Canada (payed 15 US dollars for it). I am South African so the movie hit pretty close to home - I guess you won't really understand the slapstick comedy otherwise...,944438400,4,196,4.472222222222222
7858529,5,6303995241,"If you're not in ""Tune"" with South African Humor, and didn't grow up listening to Leon's music and Radio shows, you would not appreciate this movie. If you are open to GOOD COMEDY, you need not even know who Leon  is, because he is GOOD.  As jy 'n boertjie in 'n ander land is is dit selfs  beter want dit spot lekker met die veranderinge in Suid Afrika. Ondersteun  SA films! Go Springbokke!",941500800,11,392,4.328767123287672
