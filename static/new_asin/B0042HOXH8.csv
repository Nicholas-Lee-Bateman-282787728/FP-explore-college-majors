4250913,2,B0042HOXH8,"Great TV show. I love Law And Order. NBC was a total Fool to take it off.
This is a great TV show. Season 1 & 2 had CC and SDH for the hard of hearing.
What is with this bit now? NO CC are SDH... hat gives here?",1379808000,6,211,3.326530612244898
4250914,2,B0042HOXH8,"I could not play the DVD on my DVD-TV system.  The screen indicated that the signal was blocked.  Also, Series 3 is the same as Season 1.  I discovered this when I played the DVD on my laptop computer.",1378684800,8,201,4.102564102564102

4250916,5,B0042HOXH8,"I love juxtaposing the American version episodes with the British version.  You can see how crass the police and lawyers are in New York when you compare the two.  Also, the British are very aware of civil rights and there are cases where the defendant is guilty in NY, but are exonerated in London.",1377561600,,299,4.518518518518518

4250918,5,B0042HOXH8,"I am a fan of the original Law and Order series in the U. S.  I greatly enjoyed watching the shows set in the UK, and seeing how so many of the plots were re-worked and made to fit the UK setting. I alsoloved the actors and the wonderful jobs they did in the series. I only wish it had lasted much much longer.",1372464000,3,310,3.84375

4250926,1,B0042HOXH8,This was very misleading-this was mostly season two instead of three. I returned it because we already had series 2.,1387065600,5,116,4.85
4250927,1,B0042HOXH8,Unable to play DVD not formatted for all my players.  Suggest that you not sell this product in US or suggest the right type of player for this product..,1386201600,2,153,4.275862068965517
4250928,4,B0042HOXH8,"Law & Order is one of my favorite TV shows, so I was excited to find the UK version. Similar stories but with the British forms of police work and courtroom procedures.  I loved seasons 1 and 2 and ordered SERIES 3 expecting it to be SEASON 3.  But Series 3 has some of the same episodes as Season 2, so the DVD was a disappointment in that the material was not new.

Note: this is a Region 2 DVD - compatible with UK players or it will play on an all-region player or on your computer.  Not compatible with U.S. Region 1 players.

8413688,2,B0042HOXH8,"Disappointed in the UK region DVDs. Not for USA players. Had to buy a multi Region player to view these, but they contain fewer episodes than the US version DVDs. Some of these UK episodes were on season 2 US DVDs so this was basically a waste of money.  Most seasons are not available in the US version, so looks like Im stuck.  Also there is no closed caption option. VERY disappointed.",1519257600,,388,4.375

8413691,5,B0042HOXH8,Lots of stories were taken from Law and Order USA plots but we'll done with a good cast. Careful with these as US CD players are commonly only able to play District 1 CD's and Season 3 is District 2 and will only play on certain CD players or a computer,1466121600,,253,3.980392156862745
