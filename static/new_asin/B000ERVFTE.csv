8113748,2,B000ERVFTE,I purchased the video because I have bad knees. The video caters for those with Tennis Elbow not those with bad knees. Also the video is very advanced and I've done some yoga but this video want you to get on a head stand.,1442275200,2,222,4.068181818181818
8113749,1,B000ERVFTE,It was not what I expected. I searched for yoga for bad knees and only found this one.  I have very bad knees and this one was mainly geered for tennis players with good knee.  It was more for strengthining the arm mussels for tennis.,1404172800,5,234,4.177777777777778
8113750,4,B000ERVFTE,"This yoga class has many great poses for stretching and strengthening elbows and knees, but, to its credit, it is not  a coddling practice.  Quickly flowing transitions, interspersed with poses held four to six breaths, numerous chaturanga-up dog-down dog sequences, along with warrior III and handstands, build a lot of heat, and, over time, would surely build a lot of strength.  I finish the workout feeling invigorated, stretched, calm, and powerful.

I agree the class is not ideal for beginners.  It surely helps to know what the poses are and how they are supposed to be performed, but this DVD would not be as effective if she spent time teaching the very basics.  It is nice that it is such a through workout in 35 minutes, and the level of narration is helpful to guide a more seasoned practitioner through.  She is usually explaining some details of body alignment or how the pose works, not just calling out poses.

Style-wise, the beach setting is lovely and relaxing.

Why not 5 stars?  I'm a tough grader.  I practice twice a week with a phenomenal yoga instructor, who is able to provide a level of adjustment and guidance about the history, purpose, and intricate muscle goals that I can't imagine any yoga DVD can match (unless my teacher does her own DVD series).  Although I have taken many yoga classes - and probably own 20 yoga DVDs - my current teacher is unmatched.  I purchased this DVD after I took my first tennis lesson (on vacation - away from my teacher) and the pain in my elbow was immobilizing.  I plan to do this workout at least twice a week for a month before picking up a racket again, as I find it to be more perfect for what I need now that any of my many other yoga DVDs.

Bottom line: if you are experiencing any tennis elbow pain (which could also be from typing on a laptop), tightness in your shoulders, or twinge-y knees, and you have some yoga experience, this is an excellent option to feel better and prevent future injury.",1362441600,4,1972,4.5625

8113752,2,B000ERVFTE,"I gave this a 2 star because it is not what it says it is.  The cover of the DVD says Yoga for Tennis Elbow and Bad Knees but in reality it is just a regular yoga session.
There's no specialized poses for the elbows or knees; in-fact, some of these poses won't be possible for people who are hurting from tennis elbow or bad knees.
As a long time yoga practitioner and teacher; I don't like it when someone says it is one thing and turns out not to be. Remember the integrity of yoga when you
make your DVDs.",1314489600,16,508,4.02970297029703
8113753,4,B000ERVFTE,"This DVD is labeled as for everybody, But was a little advanced for my tastes. The exercises are very good as a workout. I would have more preferred to have a little more explanation as to how to switch between the poses as I kept finding myself asking ""How did she get to that pose?"" I definitely will keep using it and hope to progress to this level of flexibility.",1281830400,5,367,4.257142857142857

8113755,5,B000ERVFTE,"I've always loved yoga, and felt it was a physical and mental safeguard for tennis. I've been off from tennis for 6 weeks suffering from tennis elbow, and previous to that, my knees were swelling from playing on hardcourts 5-6 days a week. My injuries are from becoming obsessed with tennis and not cross training. I've learned the hard way, you must cross train. This tape I absolutely love, because it feels great, it's challenging, and it promises to make your elbows invinceable. It strengthens and stretches the muscles surrounding your knees, and strengthens your body all over. This would also be a great pre-match stretch and mental preparation. I love that someone has so brilliantly made the connection between yoga and tennis.",1155513600,17,737,5.0
8113756,4,B000ERVFTE,"This video is instructed by Anastasia, Jivamukti-certified yoga teacher and avid tennis player/consultant.  She explains that the practice is designed to help strengthen your elbows and knees as a means to both prevent injury and improve your tennis game.  I'm not a tennis player, but I have dealt with ongoing tendonitis in both of my elbows, so I decided to give this video a try.  Throughout the practice, Anastasia makes frequent references to how specific poses might help your tennis game; this didn't both me, but it might bother other non-tennis players.  Also, ads for Anastasia's web site, Steady Bliss, occasionally appear on screen. The DVD is chaptered only to allow you to skip the introduction; the practice itself is not broken up.

The practice, which is performed outdoors in a scenic ocean-side setting, begins seated with several chants of OM (Anastasia instructs via voiceover throughout).  Anastasia then moves into Pranayama (breathwork) and some simple stretches for the shoulders, including child's pose and cow-face arms.  Moving to standing, Anastasia performs a side stretch before beginning several series of sun salutations.  She moves fairly quickly through the poses but pauses for a few longer holds (e.g., holding upward dog and downward dog for five breaths each).  She also adds some non-traditional postures into the classic sun salutation A series, including cobra, half locust, and full locust.  After performing several squats on the toes (meant to strengthen the knees), Anastasia moves into several rounds of sun salutation B, adding on warrior 1, warrior 2, triangle, side angle, and then warrior 3 to finish.

At this point, Anastasia moves to the wall (she seems to be on an outdoor patio at this point, as you can still hear the ocean) to practice half-handstand (feet on wall parallel to the floor) and then full handstand.  She offers good form pointers during these postures, but I stuck with the handstand prep work.  Next comes full hero's pose (buttocks on the floor between the ankles), which Anastasia states is extremely beneficial for the knees.  She continues with a twist while still seated in hero, performs a seated forward bend and table pose, and then moves into savasana.  During the 5-minute savasana, the soundtrack of relaxing piano music and ocean waves continues, and then Anastasia brings the practice to a close at about 42 minutes total.

Overall, I liked this practice.  Although it was a bit more vinyasa-y than I usually prefer (i.e., there were MANY chaturanga to upward dog to downward dog transitions), I could definitely see how this would work to build strength in my elbows (in general, there seemed to be more of a focus on elbows then on knees), and my tendonitis actually felt much better than usual for a day or two after using this video.  This is definitely an intermediate level practice which I would recommend for those with a good deal of experience in yoga only; it would be ideally suited to those who participate in both yoga and sports activities, including tennis.",1145491200,35,3060,5.049701789264414
