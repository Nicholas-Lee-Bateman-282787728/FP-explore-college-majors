4598963,1,B0058J6C8M,This is the worst parady I have ever seen.  No one can be that stupid!  Don't rent it! I got a headache 20 minutes in and had to stop watching it. what were they thinking and the writers should be shot.,1331078400,,202,3.902439024390244
4598964,1,B0058J6C8M,"All I have to say is that I wanted to watch Paranormal Activity 3 and thought I was renting it.  It is amazing how the brain works because I thought I read the title I wanted...NOPE, I have Abnormal Activity 3.  I am not going to watch it.  Sneaky tricky bastards.  I take my responsibility for allowing myself to be hoodwinked.

How disappointed I am.",1327708800,3,352,4.3538461538461535
4598965,1,B0058J6C8M,"Well, I finally fell for one. I saw the cover art, the font style, ""..ormal Activity 3"" and hit the Rent button. I thought I was renting Paranormal Activity 3, but they got me. I just spent my money on ABNORMAL Activity 3.
I guess this is a spoof on the Paranormal Activity series, but so far (15min in) it's not worth the $2. Maybe the rest of it will be interesting enough to be background noise for a lazy Saturday afternoon.
We'll see...

...Nope. Despite one or two scenes that made me chuckle, this was a poorly done movie; worse than a 1st year film student.
I wonder if someone could create a spam filter for video rentals. I'll just have to read title's and descriptions more carefully in future.",1327622400,3,705,4.3816793893129775
4598966,1,B0058J6C8M,this is the dumbest movie ever. They are trying to do a take off of Paranomal Activity. In which that is what I bought. Not Abnormal activity.,1319673600,5,142,4.296296296296297
4598967,1,B0058J6C8M,"this movie is false advertising and i bought it by mistake WASTE OF MONEY, TIME, EFFORT, and LIFE. Never buy this product, it causes SARS",1319587200,4,137,4.52
4598968,4,B0058J6C8M,"Absolutely loved it.  This movie is not to be taken seriously.

Spoiler Alert: Who hits a sleeping baby with a broom stick and films it.

Black humor run wild.  Get a couple of the fellows together, pass out the beers, and enjoy the ridiculousness of this work of art.",1319500800,4,268,4.408163265306122

8461603,2,B0058J6C8M,"Enough to make me laugh. I honestly thought this was the actual paranormal activity 3 and pressed rent by accident, and was faced with this crap. It was funny at times, and sometimes completely useless. Watch it if you want, but if your looking to rent something actually making you laugh, don't watch this.",1364774400,,307,4.703703703703703
8461604,1,B0058J6C8M,"Why would someone make this movie?  Waste of money, time, and it hurt my brain. Now I'm going to watch some old Bill Nye shows so I can be happy with myself again.",1358380800,,163,3.9393939393939394

8461606,1,B0058J6C8M,My son accidentally chose this when I asked him to get the rental ready for PARAnormal Activity 3. After watching it just a few minutes I realized this was the WRONG ONE and TOTALLY the stupidest thing I have EVER SEEN!!!,1352764800,,221,4.414634146341464

8461609,1,B0058J6C8M,"I've been wanting to watch Paranormal Activity 3 for a long time, I missed it in the theaters because of school.  Netflix is too expensive for me to wait for the movie.  So Paranormal Activity 3 only 2.99 on Amazon Video seemed a perfect fit, that was until my stupid butt realized I paid for Abnormal Activity 3, the only thing that I could possibly find funny about this movie will be years from now when I look back on this moment and realize what a fool I was for not paying attention.  The only scary part about this movie is that schmucks like me paid 2.99 USD to watch it when we could all pay about 2 bucks each and go down the street and get the movie we really wanted at a red box kiosk.  To the creators of this movie I hope your soul burns in the darkest pit of he11 for eternity, some of you may know that area by it's other name; Riverside California.",1350086400,,865,4.100591715976331

8461611,5,B0058J6C8M,"This is a really cool movie no matter what others think. Sure it's different but come on, thats what makes it fun, demons, twisted babysitting and the broom stick act. I have all the Paranormal movies but this Abnormal Activity 3 film, I can't get enough watching this one. If you are into B movies than this is the one to get. Watch the first Abnormal movie first to get the full affect! Great collector's item too! Classic! I'm a HO YO!",1331251200,,438,4.353658536585366
