8513854,5,B007BKDEYQ,"I've have often taken a bunch of photos of the same object using a variety of methods (portrait, landscape, macro, blurred, different white balance settings, etc.). What I generally want to accomplish is to make a collage that depicts the subject from what appears to be a stack of photos accidentally spilled on the floor. No single photo has the whole subject, only the ""spilled"" snapshots present the whole subject. When I heard this title I knew I had to see it. I tend to agree with his opinion of joiners giving photography a sense of time and space. I'm not a painter so no comment about paintings having a sense of time and space. There is plenty of discussion about many of his paintings having a photo or series of photos as part of the genesis of the painted work which I found only moderately interesting. Overall, a decent view into how he approaches his work. Strongly recommend.",1442793600,,893,4.622641509433962
8513855,5,B007BKDEYQ,It's worth the price of 'admission' to view this exhibition... banality as an adventure in details that transform the ordinary into extraordinary!! This volume should be in every serious art admirer's library.,1387065600,,209,5.5625
