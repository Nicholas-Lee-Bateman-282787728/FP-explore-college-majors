8334903,5,B001PYXKMU,"Australian TV aimed at older kids - if you've outgrown Round the Twist, Lockie Leonard is a lot of fun. It deals with some mature topics with a lot of humor.",1509408000,,157,4.096774193548387
8334904,5,B001PYXKMU,"This is not ""great"" drama and as is the case with ""kid"" movies it has its shallow places aplenty, but it was pleasant to watch and well enough done that I didn't mind the weak areas of plot or character. I'd buy Season Two soon as it comes in a set like this.",1373760000,,259,3.9056603773584904
8334905,5,B001PYXKMU,"The Lockie Lenard series is a very good series. Fun, exciting, and worth the moeny. Although, I would of likeda better deal as the price was a little on the expensive side. Tip for this seller is to make a better deal for the buyer by lowering the price a tad bit.",1330560000,,264,4.096153846153846
8334906,4,B001PYXKMU,"Seriously, what?

Other than that, this show is adorable and funny, and very open and honest with its kid audience and how it tackles every day problems young people may face today.",1295827200,,181,4.65625
