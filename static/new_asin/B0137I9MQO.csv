8727066,5,B0137I9MQO,"Palmy Days is a very enjoyable film! I agree with the other reviewer who writes that this really should be on DVD along with quite a few other Eddie Cantor movies. The plot moves along well. In fact, the filmmakers packed a lot of action, comedy, drama and three musical numbers into a 77 minute film yet the story was not confusing or rushed as I thought it might be. The sets were very well done especially the elaborate ones featuring the Goldwyn Girls in the art deco bakery; the acting was convincing, too. I also liked the choreography and the cinematography; it was particularly special during those musical numbers! The jokes are sometimes corny and dated but still good for a chuckle; the biggest laughs for me were during those over-the-top scenes in the art deco bakery with its gymnasium and indoor swimming pool!

When the action starts, we quickly meet the beautiful female employees of Mr. Clark's art deco bakery; these ladies begin the film with a somewhat surrealistic musical number as they work in the bakery and it's all very impressive. We also meet the fake fortune teller Yolando (Charles Middleton) who's actually a gangster with some cronies of his; they plan to take the bakery owner Mr. Clark (Spencer Charters) for all he's worth. How will Yolando do that? It's simple! He merely conducts fake fortune telling meetings with Clark, convincing Clark to hire an ""efficiency expert"" who will meet Clark that day in his office! What Clark doesn't know is that the ""efficiency expert"" will really be one of Yolando's henchmen so the crooks can get the combination to Clark's safe and steal Clark's money.

Yolando also has the help of the bumbling Eddie Simpson (Eddie Cantor) who does sound effects for the phony sances. To complicate matters further, the bakery's gym teacher Helen Martin (Charlotte Greenwood) is also being fooled by Yolando; she thinks his predictions that she'll finally meet the man of her dreams are going to come true very soon!

And so much more happens from there. Eddie is mistaken by Helen to be the man of her dreams; look for a rather funny sequence when Helen tries to get Eddie into better shape! Eddie is also mistaken by Mr. Clark for the efficiency expert Yolando predicted would come to ""help him;"" and now Eddie has to run from Helen; Yolando and Yolando's cronies all the while pretending to be the experienced new right hand man to Mr. Clark!

There's even more to the plot than this and I'll stop here to avoid giving out spoilers. Suffice it to say that the rest of the movie shows how everything works out.

Look also for George Raft and Harry Woods as Yolando's henchmen; Paul Page as Steve and Barbara Weeks as Joan Clark, Mr. Clark's young daughter. Look closely and you'll see Busby Berkeley himself as a fortune teller and a very young Betty Grable as one of the Goldwyn Girls!

Palmy Days is a wonderful film for fans of the actors in it. Moreover, people who appreciate musical comedies with some drama and action thrown in will not be disappointed.",1367366400,6,3022,4.714015151515151
8727067,5,B0137I9MQO,"At a time when musicals had fallen completely out of favor with the movie-going public, Eddie Cantor and Busby Berkeley were still able to bring smiles to faces and audiences into theatres with this 1931 pseudo-musical by offering a bankable star (Cantor) in a foolproof formula. The title refers to a ring of bogus spiritualists for which Cantor's character has served unwittingly as a front man. During the film Eddie falls repeatedly into some dangerous or embarrassing situation and by virtue of his own hyperactivity emerges victorious in each case. The film includes only three major song sequences, but they are all very well done, and coupled with Cantor's delivery they are infectious. Busby Berkeley opens the film with a musical number involving a gymnasium full of scantily clad Goldwyn Girls - supposedly employees of a surrealistic bakery where all the action takes place - in the aptly titled ""Bend Down, Sister"".  The cast includes long and lanky Charlotte Greenwood, a regrettably forgotten character actress. She plays the physical fitness instructor who believes - thanks to the bogus spiritualists - that Cantor's character is her future husband. The chemistry between Greenwood and Cantor is priceless as she relentlessly pursues Eddie. Then there is George Raft as a hood who is out to get Eddie. Finally, there is Mr. Clark, the president of the bakery, who has confused Eddie for an efficiency expert. when he asks Eddie ""How many girls do you think work here?"", Eddie's answer is a very professional ""About half"". The whole thing is 77 minutes of enjoyable musical and comedic nonsense that I never get tired of and that could only have been possible pre-code. It's too bad my VHS tape is wearing out and that there is no DVD of this item to replace it. I'd really like to see this film along with Cantor's ""Whoopee"" come out on DVD from whoever it is that currently owns the rights to Cantor's early 30's films. Singin in the Rain it isn't, but like that film it is sure to put a smile on your face every time you watch it.",1184371200,15,2049,4.804532577903683
