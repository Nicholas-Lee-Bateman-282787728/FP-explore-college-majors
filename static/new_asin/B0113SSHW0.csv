It's not a great story, but the actors do the best with what they have. Recommended to those who enjoy stories about abusive boyfriends and women who need to be rescued.",1486252800,,420,4.5394736842105265
8723597,3,B0113SSHW0,"This film seems to have started life as a Canadian made-for-TV movie with the title The Husband She Met Online. It has the low-budget, interior-setting feel of a soap opera. The pared-down pacing and rhythm of conversation also brands the film with a kind of soap opera quality.

But thats not a bad thing in this era of too many over-the-top special effects extravaganzas. What was a little more difficult for me to overcome before I could get involved with this film, was the casting of the lead actor. I initially kept thinking of Jason Gray-Stanford as the bumbling, too-eager-to-please side-kick detective in TVs Monk series. However, once I got beyond stereotyping the actor that way, I could appreciate how he had morphed into a properly menacing presence for this role.

There is nothing too memorable here, but the movie dramatizes what seems to be a common and perhaps growing problem in society  the problem of the controlling boyfriend/husband. While the character is this movie carries his need for control into shocking extremes, his early warning tendencies in that direction are not all that different from what myriad women are reporting in the media and to police.

It might be possible to draw an important lesson from this film. If someone seems too good to be true  he probably is. So this likely wouldn't be a good choice for viewing with someone on a first date. It's bound to give a prospective partner pause.",1443312000,,1433,4.85655737704918
