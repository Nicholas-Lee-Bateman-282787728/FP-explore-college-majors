351966,4,6301766261,"Impulse(1990) is a stylish neo-noir that delivers good action with underlying layers of deception. It displays Russell's finest performance that captures the conflicts within her playing L.A.'s best undercover vice cop. It is indeed about time that it is now on dvd so that fans of both neo-noir,as well as police action-thrillers, can fully appreciate this underrated film. Russel plays Lottie Mason, who, is wild, dangerous, and kinky. Lottie is constantly in conflict with her job in vice and her real straight identity as an honest cop. When we first see Lottie walking down Hollywood Boulevard, we are also drawn to the decay of this side of Hollywood, with streets at night drenched with the rain-soaked neon signs of the cheap hotels that line the Boulevard. Lottie is dressed in a skin-tight, vinyl mini-dress with stiletto heels playing a prostitute. Her job is to lure men and then call in reinforcements after the ""john"" commits a bookable offense. Therein lies the perpetual conflict that Lottie faces every day and night. As an officer of the law, she is supposed to be honest and ""good"". But her job in vice demands that She be deceptive and ""bad"". Russel captures the never-ending conflict very well, both in her actions, as well as in her face and body. So this constant conflict captures Lottie as she teeters on the very thin line separating her life as a cop from the lurid, tantalizing life of neon glitz. As the film moves forward, it captures the toll that it takes on Lottie, especially evident in her face and body language. When Lottie stumbles into a situation in which she finds a key to a locker where she finds a suitcase with one million dollars in cold cash, she is once again caught in a cinflict as whether or not to keep the cash or play it straight and turn it in to the authorities. I will not reveal the twisted ending here so as not to ""spoil"" the finale. As I said before, Russell is indeed excellent here in capturing the never-ending conflict within herself. I found her co-star, Jeff Fahey, who plays the assistant D. A., rather weak as Lottie's love interest, and the only times that the film bogs down is their scenes together. As the police lieutenant who has strong feelings towards Lottie, George Dzundza, is much more convincing in his twisted role. The Film is 109 minutes long and the transfer to widescreen is very good. The movie was directed by Sondra Locke. As I said before, it is good to finally see this on dvd. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!!",1357430400,8,2496,4.700913242009133
351967,4,6301766261,Lets release this terrific film on widescreen DVD. My VHS has just about had it.,1258329600,3,80,4.4
351968,5,6301766261,I agree with the comments of others on this movie.  A movie this good should be preserved on DVD.  The only copies available are used VHS tapes from rental libraries.  It would be a shame to lose this film.,1248825600,3,206,4.230769230769231
351969,4,6301766261,"THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE, THAT I ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE. VERY INTRIGUING MOVIE.  THERESA RUSSELL WAS SEXY AND AMAZING, AND JEFF FAHEY WAS HANDSOME AND KIND.",1193702400,,154,4.703703703703703
351970,5,6301766261,"The alluring Theresa Russell has made a healthy film career out of playing prostitutes (one of her films was actually titled WHORE). In IMPULSE, also starring Jeff Fahey, Russell plays Lottie, an undercover cop who most often poses as---you guessed it---a prostitute.

Russell is hot onscreen, so hot the screen melts, even when she plays it straight. As an actress, she has a lock on the confused inner motivations of good girls gone bad or bad girls trying to be good, and it's hard to take your eyes off of her, not at least partially because she's engaging and imbues her emotionally conflicted characters with both depth and pathos.

Lottie poses as the hook in a major drug bust being managed by FBI agent Fahey who promptly falls into bed and in love with her. Lottie reacts typically---although she disdains this ""nice guy,"" she yearns toward him as well.

Lottie's career is on the skids. In counseling and under Internal Affairs scrutiny, after a particularly brutal shootout, she impulsively goes over the line while having a drink in some bar and accompanies a stranger home for money. She reconsiders before her shoes get kicked under the bed, but while she makes her exit, this boyfriend d'jour is the victim of a hit. The circumstances of course compromise Lottie, who finds she can't tell the straight-shooting Fahey the full truth. Enter George Dzundza (Lieutenant Morgan) the embittered cop with a grudge against Lottie, who delights in sabotaging the Fahey-Russell relationship.

The chemistry between Fahey and Russell is palpable and the acting is excellent despite the overall ""B"" movie atmosphere. Russell's characterization is surprisingly strong, and the story doesn't let go until the credits roll.

Far better than you'd expect, IMPULSE delivers, and comes well recommended.",1132963200,24,1801,5.112244897959184
351971,4,6301766261,"I haven't seen this one for awhile, but it should be released on DVD, in my opinion.  I have always enjoyed the performances of Jeff Fahey and Theresa Russell, separately, in their own respective careers, but in ""Impulse"" they are dynamite together.  They have palpable chemistry that makes the film work. Their sex scene when they first get together was very hot, and very real. Good plot, good directing by Sondra Locke, good acting by Fahey, Russell, and a capable supporting cast. Good cop drama, that needs to be released on DVD!",1106784000,12,534,4.793478260869565

352088,5,6301766261,A truly under rated actress of our time. Any chance you get to watch her perform is always great. I have been waiting for this movie to hit DVD for many years.

352159,2,6301766261,"I was interested in this after reading Maltin's review which was 3 stars.  He also said that Russell's performance was her finest. Well, I don't know that I ever thought she was a fine actress but if memory serves, I would pick ""Bad Timing"" directed by her husband over any other. This movie had a weak cast any truly resembled one of the better TV productions than a theatrical release. Boring story and uninvolving characters......what's not to like?",1401235200,,452,4.794871794871795
352160,5,6301766261,This movie is a favorite of my family member but it has been out for some years.  I was concern about the quiality of the movie since it was used and not as popular when it first came out.  The color and condition was just excellent just as advertise...I was very happy with how fast it arrived and the condition of the DVD.,1396569600,,324,4.126984126984127
352161,5,6301766261,"If you like crime thrillers, then this has to be one to watch. Although the fashions of the 1980's are now looking a little bit dated, the film direction and acting kept me totally engaged right through to the end of the film. Theresa Russell is absolutely first class as the vice cop.",1391644800,,285,4.39622641509434
352162,5,6301766261,"Its a perfect widescreen version, no black bars at top or bottom. Dolby Digital 2 channel audio (which allows a home theatre sound field processor to , in my case ,decode a really decent 7.1 audio playback)",1377907200,,206,4.594594594594595

352164,5,6301766261,"Finally released.  Wonderful directorial triumph.  Rarely have the mean streets and scary nights looked so beautiful, so reflective of what's going on in the character's experience.  The action and love story are beautifully paced.  And Teresa Russell has never been more vulnerably explosive--directed to a wonderfully nuanced performance.",1360022400,4,340,6.020833333333333
352165,5,6301766261,"Not so old movie ; with nice pictures, very good sound, excellent scenario (and, I suppose, some useful indications  by our (lovely, elsewhere) Sondra Locke) ;  perfect Theresa Russell, also atmosphere, danger and action... even the not perfect but courageous strong cop ...But, as a Frenchman, I'am sorry for one thing : not subtitle, neither English nor French. I do have an old french VHS ... it helps !  Indeed, in that precious collection, with treasures, please,  it will be a good thing adding subtitles, or some foreign languages ... first of all...the French one !",1358467200,3,573,4.9375
7814739,2,6301766261,This a movie where the plot is not well connected at all. It's all over the place. One set of circumstances has nothing to do with the next. This is barely watchable....and mostly a waste.,1524268800,,188,4.4

7814742,5,6301766261,"Impulse is a terrific obscure noir thriller that is very well made, stylish and superbly acted. The stunningly sexy Theresa Russell gives an excellent standout performance. It also stars the underrated Jeff Fahey. Very engrossing and exciting all the way through, unpredictable and keeps you guessing. Its always fun to find an unknown gem but it makes you wonder why they are so under the radar when they deserve better recognition. I really hope this gets a blu ray release. Def check this movie out especially if you are a noir fan.",1470528000,,535,4.826086956521739
