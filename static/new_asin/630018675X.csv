225076,1,630018675X,"Forget about the movie, this is a terrible DVD transfer. It's the same awful transfer used on VHS in the early eighties. It's not even pan & scan, it just sits there. There are times when the character who is talking  is offscreen and the only thing we can see is the background person  completely out of focus. Avoid.",955584000,4,318,4.372881355932203
225077,2,630018675X,"The real problem I have with this film is not it's quality or the work that went into it.  It's actually better than some movies considered classics, with higher production values than such credible and successful  horror movies as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the original  ""Halloween"".  The problem is with the threat itself.  I live in  grizzly country, real grizzly country, where these big bears behave much as  they did before the continent was tamed.  Grizzlies simply don't act the  way they do in this film, and not even disease or injury could change that.  A rabid animal will succumb to the disease or fight an opponent it can't  beat (there aren't many of those for a grizzly), not engage in the  prolonged reign of terror depicted in this movie.  A pain maddened bear  will go off somewhere and die, not on a rampage.  Anyone who sees grizzly  should keep in mind that this is fiction.  I worry that it would justify  murdering bears the way ""Jaws"" has nearly made the great white  shark extinct.",948585600,4,1011,4.642045454545454
225078,3,630018675X,It may be a bloody movie but it also has some very beautifull scenery and some excellent acting.  I do recommend for children to be under adult supervision while watching.  It is worth your time to check it out.,946512000,,211,4.384615384615385
225079,3,630018675X,"This film is ok, not on par with the first Jaws. Grizzlies have attacked people. When I was in high school one of my classmates and the friends he was with were tracked by a grizzly throughout the day. Late in the night  after they built a large fire when they had all gone to sleep the grizzly  came into their camp. All but one person was able to escape. The one who  didn't was drag off by the bear and as she was she screamed ""I'm dead!  I'm dead!"" They found her patially mutilated body later the following  day. This happened in the late sixties in Montana. The film's story did  have some basis in reality however it wasn't as suspenseful as the original  Jaws.",944092800,,668,4.253968253968254

225152,4,630018675X,"When ""Jaws"" came out in 1975, Hollywood producers saw a gold mine in the public interest, and moved quickly to cash in on it. The following year was full of man vs nature releases, many of them made as cheaply and quickly as possible. Among all the films about man-eating fish, lizards, and animals driven mad by imbalances caused by man's oversight, the best of the lot, at least as far as production values, was this one. Set in an unnamed national park, but that could easily be either Yellowstone or Yosemite, it follows efforts to track down and destroy a man-eating bear that is attacking campers. The bear involved turns out to be a grizzly which has migrated down out of the northern forests, and, to make it more interesting, the bear also happens to be a genetic throwback to prehistoric times, when grizzlies weighed over a ton and stood up to 15 feet high on their hind legs. Christopher George stars as the head ranger of the park. With him is Andrew Prine, known for his role of Steven in the television mini-series ""V,"" and, as the biologist in charge of park wildlife, the most seriously underrated, and probably one of the best character actors in the business, Richard Jaeckel. With Joe Dorsey as the sleazy park supervisor, this film has a strong enough cast to more than make up for the sketchy script and choppy editing. A good way to spend a rainy afternoon.",1513209600,,1380,4.5910931174089065

225157,1,630018675X,"This movie wants to be Jaws so bad, but fails on every level. The biggest problem being a trite, paint by the numbers script that's more just a collection of tropes than a plot. The next problem is awful acting that's uneven, with illogical reactions and strained attempts a levity that makes it come off more like a lame after school special than a feature film. The cinematography and sound mixing are also terrible.

I try not to dump on movies, especially from this era since I know the technology wasn't the same, but the equipment was the issue. It wasn't just cheaply made, it's poorly made.",1501459200,,598,4.588785046728972

225179,4,630018675X,"I loved this movie when it came out back in the 70's and it still holds up pretty well.  It genuinely keeps you on the edge of your seat. So if you are looking for a good B horror movie, this is a good choice. I watched it on amazon video and it had a few glitches, the sound dropped out briefly at one point and it dropped the picture a few times, but only for a brief second. It wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of the film. I do think the bear didn't quite look big enough for the part but the camera angles did their best to make it seem like he was a 2 ton grizzly. It does have some genuine chills. Good actors made it seem believable enough, just don't expect a lot of common sense from the characters.  We all know they don't have any in movies like this or there wouldn't be any movie. Just remember when it was made and don't expect too much in special effects.",1499385600,3,874,3.9885714285714284

225575,1,630018675X,"So I- somehow, God help me- found myself watching Grizzly, a mid-70s monster-horror featuring a giant grizzly bear. The promotional posters for Grizzly featured the tagline 18 feet of gut-crunching, man-eating terror. Well, it was grizzly, all right, but I doubt it was the kind of grizzly the producers were aiming for.

Someone *recommended* this film to me. Suffice to say we are no longer on speaking terms.

The film opened with some promise as one of the main characters, Don/NamMan, helicopters some sightseers over the unnamed national park which serves as the films setting. We get some beautiful shots of tree-clad mountains and valleys which NamMan claims are virgin and untouched since before Europeans came to America. Im thinking Hey, maybe weve got an environmental message!, and the long shots in the title sequence  along with the recommendation of a previously trusted friend  make me think Grizzly was headed to be something more than just a monster movie.

Then we got into Act 1, which soundly dispelled those naive notions.

After some confusion with who the hell the protagonist is, we find out its Michael Kelly. Ill be calling him Chiseljaw, though, since thats all he is: a beautiful jawline meant to attract reluctant female movie-goers. Chiseljaw runs Unnamed Park as the direct supervisor of its many inept park-rangers, and were led to believe the majority of his job involves babysitting hikers and making sure they don't go about setting wildfires or getting themselves lost. He has a romantic interest whos cast as the Strong Female, but theres no point in even assigning her a nickname, since shes completely irrelevant to the plot. As a matter of fact, there isn't a single female in Grizzly who exists for any reasons besides as fodder for aforementioned giant bear. Oh, and cleavage/midriff, which I suppose passed for racy back in the 70s.

The only characters who matter  as much as any character can matter in this sort of film, anyways  are Chiseljaw, NamMan (Don, the obligatory Vietnam veteran who I thought was the protagonist when he flew us over the forest), and BearDude, whose name I forget but was maybe Scott but doesnt freaking matter because all you need to know is that hes a naturalist and likes to cosplay as a bear, or deer, or something.

I dunno. Hes got a massive fur cape, and he digs bears. So today hes BearDude.

Anyways, some sexy ladies get merced by the bear, which sets off an investigation and a killing spree of approximately nine-thousand people. Plot juice, but its cheap plot juice. Seriously, its like they figured out they only had thirty minutes of actual film, and the director just said Oh, its cool, sprinkle in a bear-murder between every scene until weve got a movie.

And Im not using murder flippantly, either. This is basically a serial-killer movie, only the serial-killer is a big dumb animal lacking the psychologically twisted aspect of a good serial-killer villain, and instead of cops, the good guys are park rangers. We even get the obligatory gun-and-badge scene we by now expect from that sort of cop movie, where Chiseljaw begs his Chief (or park supervisor, whatever) Let me do my job, to which the Chief responds Youre in over your head and threatens to fire him. Not those literal words, but you get my drift. I found myself wondering whether the writer didn't simply deconstruct the worst murder-spree movie ever and rewrite everything with a bear-centric focus, and to be honest Im unconvinced he didn't do exactly that.

The irony there is that its not even a good monster movie. I was unsurprised to discover Grizzly released hot on the tails of Jaws, which I suppose was the kind of movie they wanted to emulate. Knowing that, the blatant ripoff was pretty obvious. But it still felt closer to a dozen cop movies Ive seen than to Jaws.

Trudging right along, Chiseljaw, BearDude and NamMan form the least effective power-trio in cinema history. Later on I started to like NamMan, who probably would have made a better protagonist than wet-blanket Chiseljaw, and BearDude was ok too in the lovable-weirdo sense, but we all know the best buddies are only there so they can die late in the game anyways. Their bumbling is only offset by the Chief, who (were guided to believe) is playing politics by bringing press to the park and hoping to attract more visitors, or a cushy job offer for himself, by highlighting the fact that two million and counting visitors have been viciously mauled and devoured by a ginormous prehistoric bear.

You cant see me, but just know Im rolling my eyes.

The worst aspect of Grizzly, though, is ironically the freakin grizzly. Many of the shots of its feet (before the not-so-big reveal) are cearly a black bear. At one point an adult black bear is trotted onto the set and a bunch of hunters think its the grizzlys cub, which ends in some hilarious bear-on-bear violence. When the grizzly attacks, it never once bites its victims: its killing move, as far as I can tell, is split between either a lethal bear hug and a swing of its mighty claws, which at one point literally decapitates a horse in a single swipe.

I wish I had something good to say. I wish I could post a review that wasn't entirely comprised of ridicule and mockery. But the unfortunate fact is that ridicule and mockery are more than Grizzly deserves.

It should have languished in ignominy, forgotten in the dusty halls of crappy films. It doesnt deserve a Wikipedia page. It should have withered and died on the vine anonymously, unreleased, and  barring that  nobody should have been talking about it one year later, much less forty.

Instead my idiot friend recommended it to me, which is the only reason this review exists. To me, the real lesson in Grizzly is Be Careful Who You Trust. Oh, and if you're going to make a bear movie, you should know something about bears.",1471737600,2,5878,4.782823297137216

226159,5,630018675X,"It was my privilege to see the movie, Grizzly, back in 1975, when I was stationed at Scott AFB, in Illinois, right after a viewing of the movie, Jaws.  I will never understand why Grizzly was not given the same Walk-0f-Fame granted Jaws.  Fellow Officers at Scott AFB, who grew up in the wilds of the North, told me the nature-run-amok atmosphere in ""Grizzly"" was actually true in many ways:  They recounted actual Grizzly attacks on people in Canada, the State of Alaska and National Parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone.  There are Rogue Bears, especially Grizzlies that reek havoc on wildlife, livestock - and people of all ages.  There is a great deal of drama, but the Actors Christopher George, Andrew Prine and Richard Jaeckel
gave superb performances that matched the real dangers of a maxima ursus!  I rate this movie at a five star - plus!  Every family member will have an appreciation for the draconian side of a Yogi Bear that is not satisfied with just stealing picnic baskets, but proceeded in indiscriminate terror to kill with mayhem leaving behind pools of blood and body parts whether animal or humans of all ages.",1462924800,7,1132,4.774358974358974

226331,1,630018675X,"Grizzly is one of my favorite nature-runs-amok films of all time. Unfortunately, the transfer on this Blu-ray looks horrible.

I bought this Blu-ray a few days ago at Amoeba Records for $39.95. It was a bit pricey but I thought Scorpion may have done a limited release, similar to Twilight Time. It wasn't until I got home that I read the warning printed on the back (in super tiny letters at the bottom), This Blu-ray of GRIZZLY is not up to our standards for a Blu-ray release. However, due to the overwhelming request for this film, we are presenting the film to you in the best way possible in HD. Although there are many imperfections with the materials, we hope you can still enjoy the presentation as it is while viewing. Thank you. This information should have been printed on a large red sticker and stuck right on the front!!!

Ive read similar warnings before but they always sounded worse than what you actually saw; most of the time the affected material was just thought-to-be-lost or censored scenes that were added to the original theatrical version. Not with the Grizzly Blu-ray! When they say, many imperfections with the materials what they mean is, THE WHOLE FILM!!! This Blu-ray is so grainy and fuzzy, that it looks like a dub from a VHS copy. There is no detail in the pine trees and the artifacting is completely distracting.

Scorpion gives you two versions of the film: Filtered and Unfiltered. To tell you the truth, I couldn't tell the difference between the two; both versions looked the sameterrible.

I own many Scorpion releases and generally they do a very fine job with all of them. I am just surprised that they decided to release this horrible transfer, regardless (especially) if there was an overwhelming request.

If you love Grizzly, the best version to own is the Shriek Show 2-DVD set. The quality is amazing and looks about a hundred times better than this Scorpion Blu-ray.",1452729600,9,1917,4.744744744744745

226736,5,630018675X,"Love-love-love this movie, it's about a KILLER grizzly for pity sake, what's not to love!?  (It's not as if there's a glut in the subgenre of movies about killer grizzlies.)  In this case, a hungry woman-eating grizzly sneaks into a national park and makes a meal of several ladies (said grizzly eventually switches to a steady male meat diet and even tried to snack on a little boy before his mother thought to get in the way and became the meal of the day!!!!).

Yes, it's true; most of the obvious plot points have been shamelessly lifted from Jaws.  You can easily spot the comparable scenes and character substitutes.  On one hand, that's a bit troubling, you can be inspired by someone else's work, but to blatantly use it as a blueprint for your own rip-off.........  On the other hand, they did such a great job replicating it that one can almost turn the other way and call it a tribute.  Yeah, that's it; imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  Hey, it's not as if they were sued over it!

I also liked that they used a well-worn effect from horror films by showing some scenes from the bear's POV, complete with heaving breathing!!!  Jaws never did that!

Thank goodness someone thought to bring along a bazooka for the final showdown (so much for the hope of capturing it alive!).

No one seems to be able to get the colors bright and vibrant (don't tell me its the Todd-AO format they used or the period of the '70s) and there MUST be some way to tweak the image of this classic. I was hoping Scorpion Releasing fixed the problem (now I know why its not on blu ray) but the same problems plague this release (and its 2014!) from long ago. The picture is so inconsistent that it is annoying to watch. Nice for a moment or two, then fuzzy, lack of color, then it clears up in the next shot. Dirt and debris plagues the whole presentation. It is sad that this low budget film has never got the respect it deserves on home video. I would have be really mad paying a high price for this on blu ray, because it is nowhere near the ""master in HD from the original interpositive"" that is stated on the cover.

226942,3,630018675X,"""Grizzly"" is a horror movie from 1976 about a prehistoric monster-bear with a penchant for walking on two legs and an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The film itself is so-so. Occasionally, it's too much of a splatter movie. But yes, if you bear in mind (pun unintended) that ""Grizzly"" was made in 1976, I suppose you could be entertained or even slightly scared by it.

Personally, I think the bear is pretty cool! Despite the title, the mama bear featured in the movie is a trained Kodiak bear, not an actual grizzly. Apparently, the same bear also shows up in ""Day of the Animals"", a more interesting flick. It seems acting runs in the family, at least as far as bears are concerned. The unnamed bear in ""Grizzly"" eventually gave birth to Bart the Bear, another trained Kodiak who went on to become a super-star. He was featured in about a dozen Hollywood and TV productions, including a documentary about himself! If you have a crush on bears (the animals, that is), you might find ""Grizzly"" to be a real scorcher. I mean, Kodiak bears are IMMENSE. Just fast-forward every time the teddy supposedly slashes some hiker or park ranger.

226998,4,630018675X,"This movie has gotten a lot of flak over the years as a land-based Jaws copy.  That criticism is obviously true to some extent.  However, the bulk of movies today are often just re-hashes and remakes of stories that have been done to death (2012's subpar ""The Amazing Spiderman,"" anyone?)  Other film makers, like the folks behind the initially highly rated Paranormal Activity series, copied first off a previous film (The Blair Witch Project) and then off themselves for their own fleet of subsequent and vacuous sequels.  Many of these films are lauded by the same critics who criticized movies like ""Grizzly"" - one of the many inconsistencies that are all too apparent if you follow the careers of film critics.  William Girdler, who directed Grizzly, said he made films for movie fans and didn't care what critics thought.  He wanted the audience to enjoy his films and he didn't care what a critic, paid to criticize, had to say.  ""Critics,"" he said, ""don't buy tickets, so I don't care.""  Girdler tragically died in a helicopter crash at the age of 30.

In comparison to any of the films above and countless others, ""Grizzly"" was and remains far more original.  Think about it.  In general I think we are getting ever less discriminating, less demanding and more accepting of rehashed crap.  Granted, ""Grizzly"" did some of this too, and perhaps is an example of a film that led us, to some extent, to where we are today in commercial film making.  I guess I am arguing its sins were smaller at the time, more readily recognized for what they were and darnit - considered within its time frame it was a much cheaper yet better constructed film than many wasteful, newer, fancier, flashier products that are fed to us by major motion picture companies today.  It is well directed, has a good cast, is paced well and is entertaining throughout.

I love the opening shots of this film, which set the pace for the entire picture.  A serene forest scene features some birds chirping, but otherwise silence.  Suddenly, with an explosion of noise a helicopter shoots across the sky from the upper quadrant - creating a perfect visual collision of wilderness and human intervention.  That concept is the foundation for virtually every film of the ""human vs. nature"" movies that followed Jaws, but few films capture it so succinctly and with great effect - and in the opening scene!  The opening credits roll a short time later as we pan over the wilderness from the vantage point of the chopper while the film's enjoyable and thoroughly 70s sounding soundtrack begins.  The cast does a good job and takes the material seriously.  Christopher George was particularly well cast, I thought.  George, incidentally, died in 1983 at 54 years of age.  This is one of his best roles.  Richard Jaeckel also does well with the material.  The characters are pretty well developed and more importantly, they are likeable.  You care about what they are doing.

It does have its problems.  The claimed size of the bear isn't communicated all that well in some later actual shots of a real bear, and there are some other minor quibbles I have - but they really aren't important.  This is a fun film to watch.  The DVD release from ""Shriek Show"" is a good print and includes a few extras.  If you saw it in the 70s, check it out again.  If you have never seen ""Grizzly"" - do yourself a favor and watch this enjoyable, well made film featuring a talented director and a capable, if lesser known leading actor who both died far too early in their professional careers.",1345766400,,3548,4.709415584415584

A hit comes out and then the low budgeters use the formula on various degrees of financial scale. So this would be a clear well acted b movie scale, there were even lower budget ones from overseas and though but because this wasn't the video age like the 80's you didn't have the no budget takes on video tape or now digital camera!.  However reviewers too often forget that b movies are NOT A movies, and this while following a monster animal on the loose senario actually became a horrible reality in alaska with a monster 17 foot grizzly eating people until it was hunted down. THankfully rogue bear attacks are rare but even the most accepted human being EVER by bears timothy t of alaska was killed along side his girlfriend by a rogue grizzly. See the movie 'grizzly man' by werner herzog , I don't fault the man in the least even by the way. THe story here is similiar to jaws with a ranger going after a maneater grizzly that's 15 feet tall and that's eating people. It's borrowed alot in storyline from jaws but at least this was a professional movie with some really decent actors.
These unlike alot of b movies were quality seasoned actors. THe underrated andrew prine, and the late richard jaekel do a fantastic job really. Christopher george a actor who looks like kevin bacons dad! does a standup job too. The effects are dated to be sure but audiences back then weren't as critical because just ten years earlier people died on camera with no blood sometimes! when  you know cinema then you can better judge what's really bad.

227054,3,630018675X,"I hadn't seen this film since I saw it in theaters in the 70's, but I guess some things aren't as good as you remember them, 'Grizzly' is a cheap rip off of the far superior 'Jaws', but originality aside, this film was doomed before it started.

Like 'Jaws' the director tries to set the mood with a couple of early killings by the beast, but this doesn't evoke much fear. The budget restraints really show early with a prop bear claw that is used for the first half of the picture. The film does pick up a bit in the second half when we see the bear which is a real live grizzly (named Teddy) who is quite big.  Unfortunately, the bear is never really shown with anything in the frame to get a perspective of its supposed giant size.

It's a shame because one really good shot of this would have allowed the audience to suspend disbelief for the rest of the film. In 'Jaws', once we see the Shark coming up for the Chum that Brody is slinging over the side of the boat, we are completely glued to the screen (and $hi#ing our pants!)! Of course another problem is sharks are monstrous looking with their huge mouth, razor sharp teeth and lifeless eye, where bears look kind of cute even though we know what they're capable of. It just doesn't work the same way the shark works in 'Jaws'. Maybe the bear should have been rabid or something?.. to make it look more terrifying?.... I don't know?

I recall another film 'The Prophecy' where the bear looks very scary and appears more threatening than the bear in this film, most of the time 'Grizzly' looks like we are watching a nature program about bears. A lot of the dialogue is boring and the deaths have no build up, so for the most part this is not all that good.

The good news is the DVD presentation is very nice with commentary, trailers, featurette, old promos, stills gallery, and interviews with the surviving cast members.  I discovered that the same company has released this film with two other films in a three DVD pack at a cheaper price and from what I've read it contains the extra material or at least most of it that's on this release. Considering this isn't the greatest film, I would rather buy the triple feature and get two additional nature strikes back films at a cheaper price. They appear to be the same quality, so why not? If you're a fan of this film, I'm sorry to be so hard on it, but it's my honest opinion. It's an OK watch, but I wish they had taken more time and spent a little more money to make it better.",1250035200,,2493,4.316239316239316
227055,3,630018675X,"Is ""Grizzly"" any good? Well.......that depends.

If your idea of ""good"" means a scary film chock full of suspense, well acted with fantastic special effects and solid directing...then no, ""Grizzly"" isn't the film for you.

But on the other hand, if you love cheezy movies, movies where the most expensive special effect is 1 bear arm used repeated to simulate bear attacks, if your idea of cheese is a cast full of characters actors on loan from ""The Love Boat"", with script elements stolen from ""Jaws""...then yes, ""Grizzly"" is good.

I've loved this film since my folks took my brother and I to see it at the local drive-in back in the 70's. And I'll admit it right here, thise flick gave me plenty of nightmares when I was a kid. I dare say, this flick cause more restless nights for me than ""Jaws"" did. (of course living in the middle of the woods, and about 3 hours from the nearest ocean, I could relate to ""Grizzly"" a little more than ""Jaws"") It was amazing watching this film 30 years later, just how much of the movie I remembered!

This is a typical 70's nature-gone-amok horror film, and firmly sits among ""The Pack"", ""The Swarm"", ""Kingdom of the Spiders"", ""Tentacles"" and ""Orca"". There isn't really anything new here, but it's still a lot of fun.

Christopher George is the park ranger who vows to take it out along with nature nut, Richard Jaeckel, and helicopter pilot Andrew Prine.  See the Jaws comparisons?  The owner of the campground refuses to close the park as it will affect business.  Sound more like Jaws now?
It all makes for a good and entertaining piece of ravenous animal nonsense.  In the first half of the film, the bear is shown only as a fake bear arm/paw swiping at folks.  This is actually more entertaining than the second half where the real bear is seen!  The shots of the actual bear intercut with the tiny bits of fake bear aren't so bad considering this probably wasn't a Schmuckheimer budgeted film.
It's a tad bloody too for the PG rating.  One very amusing scene has the aforementioned fake bear arm whisking through the air and decapitating Richard Jaeckel's horse!  The bear's obviously seen The Godfather one too many times.

It would have been better to have had a guy in a rubber suit than to use actual footage of a bear prowling around. But, there is one scene that gives me laughs just thinking about it now!

A cabin becomes a prison to this girl who finds refuge there and the Grizzly comes a knockin on the door for a HUFF AND I' LL PUFF move until it eventually kills the girl and destroys the cabin. Well, the moment the Grizzly lifts it' s claws up in the air for a blow to the girl, it is TOTALLY FUNNY! The arm and the claw are basically a guy probably holding a long wooden pole with hair all over it and than this fake paw at the end of it with a swing back and forth for realistic value! Hhahahha! I rewinded that a bunch of times! Hhahha! This movie needed more of that and less seriousness and less money invested.

So, if you are ever in the mountains and you know about a Grizzly roaming the countryside? Make sure it is not a guy with a long stick ready to PAW YOU!",1236124800,,1295,3.9922779922779923

I remember attending the theatre as a kid for so many of these pictures (Jaws, Food of the Gods, Empire of the Ants, Orca, etc.). Those were the days--counting bodies and waiting for the next ""cool kill."" In the following decade, the animals would be replaced by an even greater nemesis--ourselves (in the form of slasher flicks).

Admittedly, many of the ""animal attack"" films were short on thrill and plot, and Grizzly can't claim to be original in any respect. Its screenplay borrows heavily from the success of Jaws, right down to the characters. Instead of Chief Brody battling a shark, we have Park Ranger Kelly matching wits with an ursine-sized foe. Grizzly also relies heavily upon the POV shot (point of view), where we get to see the unsuspecting prey through the bobbing perspective of the bear. Despite the clumsiness of these scenes, Grizzly has enough B-movie acting and thrills to rank near the top of the films in this particular genre. No, it's not anywhere close to being the masterpiece that Jaws is, but if you have an afternoon to kill--why not feast along with the hairy star of this film?

I believed it and really had trouble sleeping that night. All I could think of was a bear smashing the bedroom window to get at me. Anyway, I find it interesting that so many other people see the similarities to Jaws as far as the characters go, because, for a long time, I thought I was the only one. I am glad to have finally seen extras on this film. I always wondered whether the bear was real, which it is.

I don't think I've had such a disparity in my opinions as I had with ""Grizzly"". ""Grizzly"" at one time was my second favorite film, after ""Jaws"" (which still remains right up there).

I haven't seen this film since I was a kid...and honestly I'm not sure if I saw it in a theater (shame on my parents... : ) or edited on bad weekend afternoon TV.

Regardless, I recall the thrills of the rampaging bear. I remember the three protagonists being similar to my Jaws family. I remember the horse.

So I gleefully plopped down in front of my TV, and spun up my new copy of my old fave, ""Grizzly.""

WOW is this a bad movie! Howlingly bad. Excruciating. Painful. Often unintentionally funny, and not in a good way.

In terms of ""acting"", Christopher George does his best to maintain some sort of rugged believability. Andrew Prine has a modicum of laconic naturalness. Richard Jaeckel, as the slightly-off naturalist, has, I think, one decent line.

Everything else, and I mean everything else, is flat-out awful. There is better acting to be found in any elementary school Christmas pageant seen across the country each winter.

The gore is not enough to satisfy the Fangoria set, yet the day-glo blood and brief shots of mangled limbs (and one mangled child) will surely turn off those with less-hardened sensibilities.

Even the score must have sounded dated the weekend after this film was originally released.

The only real pleasure in seeing this film now is mentally checking off the hysterical number of similarities to ""Jaws"". THAT'S kinda funny, and could be somehow converted into a pleasant drinking game amongst fans...

SPOILER ALERT...I'm giving away a little of the ending...

...especially when throughout the movie, this freakin' bear gets shot a few dozen times, without a scratch. There's a casual comment about a helicopter pilot being in Vietnam, and a brief scene of two people loading up the copter with guns and stuff.

So after this bear wreaks his havoc throughout the forest, the bear gets shot with a bazooka-like device, and explodes like nothing you have ever seen.

Seriously...the editing is comical, but it's basically...shoot! Then...HIROSHIMA! Then somebody somberly walking by a perfectly circular spot of fire about ten feet in diameter.

It's just goofy.

The most exciting part for me was recognizing the work of one of my old favorite comic book artists, Neal Adams. He did the cover artwork!

The DVD is actually a terrific set. Nice extras. The film itself will probably never look this good ever again. The period featurette still has the VHS dropouts, rolling bars and glitches there for all to see.

Fans will wax deliriously over this release, and justifiably so. But I warn you, if you haven't seen this movie in twenty years, you might want to preserve those memories just the way they are, and spare yourself the disappointment...",1152144000,17,3103,4.878095238095238
227148,5,630018675X,"I remember watching GRIZZLY on television many years ago. I didn't watch much of it but a few scenes stuck out, such as the aerial photography of the forest and the climax. But after watching the DVD last night, I can tell you that GRIZZLY is one of the better JAWS-style, nature-run-amok films. Although the similarities to JAWS stick out like ol' Grizzly's claws, there's plenty going for it to make it stand out on its own, such as the three leading men (Christopher George, Andrew Prine, and Richard Jaeckel), the aforementioned aerial photography, Robert O. Ragland's musical score, and some very intense Grizzly attack sequences, especially the one on little Bobby! If a movie such as  this invites comparisons to a bigger and more successful movie, it must have its own unique qualities to really stand out, and GRIZZLY does the job; it was the highest-grossing independent film of 1976 and is still remembered today.

Big up to Shriek Show for another top-of-the-line release of something other labels would not have even given a passing thought to. On this double-disc edition, there's a commentary, a vintage featurette (culled from VHS, no doubt), a screening of the film, new interviews, a trailer, radio spots, and a poster and photo gallery. I also recommend DAY OF THE ANIMALS, another nature-run-amok film from William Girdler, the late director who really knew how to work these kind of films.",1151280000,32,1410,4.970338983050848

How about PIRANHA or TENTACLES? Yep, the '70s were awash in killer animal movies! I do consider JAWS to be the best example, but GRIZZLY was one of the better ones. You know the basic plot already. Big forest + big bear + hikers / campers = big bloodbath. Christopher George (Pieces) is Kelly, the tough park ranger. Andrew Prine (Crypt Of The Living Dead) is Don, the local chopper pilot. Richard Jaeckel (The Dark) is Scott, the kooky naturalist. Together, they must track down and neutralize the beast before it eats anymore tourists. The griz itself was played by an 11' trained bear named Teddy. Ted has a stand-in for the bearhug shots (a guy in a fuzzy suit). The attack scenes aren't bad, with arms flying off, horses heads lopped, faces torn open, etc. I recommend this one for any / all ""animal revenge"" fans (like me).

2) beach resort / camping park

3) bathers killed / campers killed

4) sheriff wants the beach closed / chief ranger wants park closed

5) mayor wants money flow / park owner wants money flow

6) Amity recruits salty fisherman / park recruits naturalist

...and I'm sure the list is longer, but DO NOT let that deter your purchase!!  Because even though GRIZZLY may be considered a ""rip-off"" by some, it may well be the BEST rip-off of its kind!  I saw the film at its opening waaay back in 1976, and fell in love with it instantly---beginning with the terrific aerial helicopter shots and unforgetably sweeping Robert Ragland theme accompanying the opening credits, and featuring the talents of camera-friendly actors Christopher George and Richard Jaeckel, I was hooked on this film.  When it was released onto home video in the early 80's, I think I wore my VHS tape out.  (Films always seem to ""work"" when you cast likeable actors portraying likeable characters.)

Without making myself sound like I was one of the film's investors, I've always been amazed by the amount of people who have trashed GRIZZLY, with such terms as ""shlock,"" ""bottom-of-the-barrel,"" ""Grade-Z,"" etc.  GRIZZLY marked the sixth film for director William Girdler (1947-1978), whose previous works include ""ASYLUM OF SATAN"" and ""THREE ON A MEATHOOK,"" two early 70's drive-in pieces of...yes, ""shlock,""--which is probably why GRIZZLY is not highly regarded.  BUT this film IS a highly marked improvement, showcasing the director's talent for mainstream cinema--finally with a decent budget to work with and beautiful (Kentucky) scenery to film against (not to again mention screen notables).  The film made for a fun night at the movie theatre in 1976--pure and simple, and will prove itself to be a fun night in your living room in 2006!

--I've refused to purchase the OTHER dvd of GRIZZLY that's been available for several years (and is now curiously out-of-print), simply due to its poor transfer reviews--the bargain basement company released it in FULLscreen (GRIZZLY was shot in 70mm / aka 2.35:1), and not even presented with panning and scanning!

I honestly didn't think GRIZZLY would EVER be decently released onto DVD...having assumed you need director/studio participation for the product...and, considering the facts that the director and its two major stars are deceased, the company (Film Ventures International) since dissolved, and executive-producer/embezzler Eddie Montoro in hiding in South America, I was NOT very optimistic about GRIZZLY ever making its way to DVD.

When the news came out that Media Blasters/Shriek Show was releasing ""GRIZZLY,"" my order was placed without even blinking an eye!!  I've not once been disappointed with their transfer work, and am sure that they will be giving GRIZZLY the full-blown treatment that it finally deserves after all these years.",1139788800,8,3132,5.1420118343195265

""Grizzly"" was made one year after the hugely-successful ""Jaws."" It's obvious that the creators wanted to profit from that film's popularity because the plot is basically the same, albeit with a different animal, land instead of ocean, etc. The main difference, however, is that ""Jaws"" was a first-rate film, whereas ""Grizzly"" is strictly Grade B.

How can one tell? Well, First rate films like ""Jaws,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" stand the test of time -- although you can tell they're older films for obvious reasons, they're so well done on all levels that you hardly even notice. Grade B films like ""Grizzly,"" however, do not pulsate with creative originality, they lack that certain pizzazz to set them apart.

This is not to say that ""Grizzly"" isn't entertaining; it is, as long as you understand going in that you're seeing a Grade B Jaws-on-land type flick. We're not talking ""Apocalypse Now"" here.

WHAT WORKS: The Northern Georgia location -- Black Rock Mountain State Park -- is a pleasant surprise. If you enjoy deep forest adventure type movies, then this film's for you.

The scene wherein the bruin destroys a fire outlook post is good.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: aside from the obvious ""Jaws"" rip-off and Grade B film problems mentioned above, the grizzly in the picture doesn't look as big as they say it is. In the movie the bear is supposed to be a prehistoric survivor, some 15 feet tall or so. Don't get me wrong here, the thought of running into a grizzly is frightening enough, ask my wife who had a nervous breakdown on a trail in Glacier National Park, Montana (one of only two areas where grizzlies still dwell in the lower 48). It's just that the bear doesn't look as big as they SAY it is in the film.

Also, as with most Grade B fare, the score is substandard and dated.

Maybe their reviews are based off a different rating system than the one here, like one that uses 20 stars...while watching Grizzly (1976), one cannot help but notice how much the film 'borrows' from the extremely successful 1975 Spielberg movie Jaws.  Unfortunately, director William Girdler is no Spielberg.  The movie stars B actor Christopher George as Ranger Michael Kelly, who some may remember from TV's Rat Patrol, as Sgt. Sam Troy.  Also starring is Richard Jaekel as a naturalist by the name of Arthur Scott.  I best remember Jaekel from the Lee Marvin film, The Dirty Dozen (1967), and I felt quite sorry for him that his career has sunk to the point where he got stuck in this pile of a movie.

The film starts off with the brutal killing of two, comely young women in a national park.  Limbs are torn, blood is shown, but the only thing we see of the attacker is a pretty phony looking paw groping the women.  The now deceased women are found, examined by a coroner, who informs Ranger Kelly that the women where mauled by a bear, a big bear.  This sets up the search for the bear, and also for the killing of some more people.  Naturalist Arthur Scott, or Scotty, is called in from the woods, and he speaks of the bear being at least 15 feet tall and weighing between 2,000 to 3,000 pounds, based on the size and depth of the bear's paw print tracks, which he has examined.

Most of the film is the characters trying to find the bear, and the bear attacking and killing more people.  We don't get to see the bear often, mostly through POV (point of view) shots, which can be useful and create suspense when used properly and in limited fashion, but where way overused here, and quickly became annoying.  Hunters show up, things happen, and it's all pretty boring.  I don't mind when films take from more successful films, but here the pillaging from Jaws was so very blatant it only served to highlight just how poor this movie was compared to Jaws.  Ranger Kelly (Chief Brody), Naturalist Scott (Matt Hooper), hunter Don Stobler (Quint), Charley Kittridge, The National Park Supervisor (Mayor Larry Vaughn), it's all here and more.  Even specific scenes were lifted and not very competently inserted into this movie.  Had there been an ounce of originality present, I would have been inclined to judge the film less harshly, but there wasn't.  Not one bit.  Also, there were a number of scenes with things that just made no sense.  A perfect example...Ranger Kelly's quasi love interest is presented early on, and she is, we find out, a professional photographer.  Well, after finding the remains of the two women mauled at the beginning of the film, she's at the site taking pictures.  Only thing is, it's in the middle of the night, and she never once uses a flash.  What kind of pictures was she taking?  If you've ever been in the deep woods in the middle of the night, you'll know how dark it can get.  And she was supposed to be a professional photographer?  There are a ton of discrepancies like this throughout the film.  After awhile, these things gave me a headache, and I just decided to go with the flow, and ride this dog out to the end.  And what an end!  I won't spoil it, but I laughed so hard at the abruptness of the final scene, and couldn't help question just exactly where the character acquired the piece of ordinance he had, useful as it was.  And do bears drink gasoline?

The picture quality on this Nutech Digital Inc. release is pretty poor, but watchable, and is presented in full screen format.  Don't bother looking for special features of any kind.  Heck, there aren't even chapter stops here, which, to me, is a sign of uber-cheapness.  I know the film was like only ten bucks, but would it have killed someone to included chapter stops?  I guess so...I know many films have tried to catch a ride on the meaty Jaws gravy train, some being moderately successful, but this one tried to align itself just a little too closely, causing a copious amount of dislike to be generated within this viewer.  That, along with the just all around poor release on to DVD, elicits a two star rating, which is generous, in my opinion.  Oh yeah, a little tip...if you are ever in the woods searching for a giant killer bear that's eating people, avoid separating from your group to take a half nekkid bath in the river, especially if you're a woman.  Grizzly bears seem to like to eat mostly women, especially scantily clad ones.  Movies teach us so much...

In Alaska a park ranger was attacked by a 13-foot, 1,600 pound grizzly bear. The Park Ranger had to shot the bear 6 times with a 7mm rifle to get him to go down.

227269,4,630018675X,"This movie sure was not about Yogi stealing peoples picnic baskets, more like a 15 foot 2 thousand pound grizzly bear having lunch on a bunch of people in a national park. The movie was good but not great but I do have to say the acting was not too bad for a horror flick. I am also glad that the bear was a real bear and not some cheap mechanical one that would look fake. Or worse, some guy in a bear suit. The gore scenes were not graphic, there were only three I found to be sort of graphic, but the shots were not extreme close ups, nor did they stayed focused on the scenes. Example, one victum in the very beginning had her arm swatted off, but they did not focus a long time on the severed limb, so I guess a viewer could not get enough time to see how fake the severed arm looked. Some of the shots at night were bad, it was a little hard to see but I saw the vhs not dvd version. My only problem with the film is it did not make me believe that this was a 15 foot 2 thousand pound grizzly. In the first scenes you never see the bear, then towards the end you get to see it, and you say to yourself, this looks like your run-of the mill, average trained bear. I guess better for a real bear then a fake, but Mr Bear did not even approach the proportions of the 15 foot, 2 thousand pound range. Also there is one scene when the bear swats off the head of a horse, then procedes to attack the man. The guy falls with very shallow scrathes on his face. If the bear could tear the head off a horse with one swipe, why did the man not suffer the same fate? Also while the bear attacked and killed many people, he did not eat them to the bone, as someone in the movie said. The few corpses you did see, they were mauled, but whole, did not look eaten to me. Other then that, this was not too bad. They did a good job as far as acting and making the movie with a low budget. Even the bear did a good job in acting like a mean and hungery grizzly. It is not as good as Jaws or Alligator, but better then Crocodile and Crocodile 2.",1079568000,2,2031,3.9082125603864735
227270,3,630018675X,"This movie was offered up as a Jaws clone but the actual story was written long before.  Tweaking the movie to fit the Jaws theme seems to have made some unfortunate changes.
First we have a sub plot introduced when we first meet Joan McCall.  Her character is a photographer and the daughter of the owner of a fine restaurant.  The subplot involves the restaurant being on the verge of bankruptcy but it is dropped right after it is introduced.
Another scene is where a radio announcer's voice is heard issuing warnings about a killer bear and that backpackers are urged to leave the area.  During the voice over we see a large group of backpackers running through the trees as if they were listening to the broadcast.
Unlike Jaws, which takes place in Amity, we have a nameless location for this movie.  The entrance to the park merely says, ""National Park Entrance"".
The basis of the story is a little silly, that of a prehistoric grizzly (15 feet tall) getting a taste for people.  An 11-foot modern grizzly was filmed for the movie, so there really was no reason to allude to a prehistoric origin.  A 15-foot modern grizzly would have been just as scary.
So we have a big grizzly stalking territory not known for grizzlies (great whites have frequented the area where Jaws takes place).  The park staff, only a small handful for a few million acres, has to stop the bear while management is worried about bad publicity.
In the end, rifles are apparently useless in stopping the beast so other, more Jaws-like, methods are used.
There is some nice forest footage and some of the tension is well done, but the characters seem to be lacking in emotion.  For example, the second victim stumbles on the first just as she is killed.  She looks for a few seconds then turns and runs.  She makes no sound and exhibits no real terror, horror or even fear.  Not very realistic.

But this one was a real being even though the height and weight of this one was a bit imaginative (15 feet tall and over 2000 lbs.) Grizzlies have been known to attack people. This movie made you not want to go hiking and/or camping in the woods. Just like ""Jaws"" made you not want to go in the water. The killings were graphic like the first woman's arm lying on the ground after it was ripped off her body and the other woman who was being slung back and forth by the grizzly til she fell to the ground and the horse's head being torn off. Just like something a grizzly would do. The only part I don't like is were the grizzly attacks that little boy. One part I could not understand is toward the end when ranger Kelly's friend Don shoots the grizzly twiced and the thing is still coming toward him. Why did he stand there and hold the rifle up like a baseball bat? Did he think he was just going to knock him out with one blow? I know if I shot at a grizzly that supposedly was fifteen feet tall and weighed over 2000 lbs. and the thing kept coming toward me, I'm damn sure not going to stand there and hold a rifle like a ball bat and expect to knock him into left field. I'm going to get the heck out. The orchestra music and the over head shots of the forest and montains from the helicopter at the beginning was excellent.

227329,3,630018675X,"I remember when I first saw ""Grizzly"" at the movie theater during the mid-1970s. I must be truthful. At the time, filled with a child's energy undoubtedly spawned by too much candy and coke, I thought it was a terrifically exciting action flick. I loved the thundering musical score by Robert O'Ragland, the dizzying camera angles during the helicopter sequences and the likeable camaraderie between leads Christopher George, Richard Jaeckel and Andrew Prine.
When watching the film again as an adult, I was pleasantly surprised that many of my fond memories still held up. Granted, ""Grizzly"" is strictly a B-Movie imitation of the far superior ""Jaws,"" complete with an inexperienced law enforcement official, an eccentric zoological expert, a salt-of-the-earth guide and a corrupt supervisor/executive. But there is a surprising energy to the proceedings as these hunters slowly close in on a prehistoric 18-foot grizzly dining on unsuspecting (and for the most part female) campers.
The picturesque scenery (filmed at a state park in Georgia) adds to the energetic proceedings, camouflaging the film's conservative budget. But not even the tallest of pine trees can cover up a painfully awkward supporting cast (many of whom are the title character's appetizers), backyard special effects (a man in a bear suit) and the prolonged, violent deaths of two important cast members.
Granted, ""Jaws"" was an extremely violent film, but the violence was always stylish. The corpses which begin popping up (and falling down) in ""Grizzly,"" look as if they've been bathing in buckets of discount Karo syrup.
What I like about ""Grizzly"" is the tremendously exciting final battle between the bear and the surviving members of the hunting party. Intense close-ups and quick editing truly create a suspenseful confrontation. We should probably thank director William Girdler (a schlock hack whose infamous credits include ""Three on a Meathook"" and the horrible ""Day of the Animals""), in what is most likely the only good film he ever helmed.
An added note must be made about the film's rather somber conclusion, where a survivor sadly inspects the chaos surrounding him. While ""Grizzly"" does not necessarily have a sad ending, there is general remorse shown by this character for the victims of the title beast. This haunting moment is actually an improvement over the rather lighthearted conclusion to ""Jaws"" the year before.
The three leads are uniformly likeable, as Christopher George, Richard Jaeckel and Andrew Prine utilize their experienced personas to full effect. As a child watching these brooding and flawed heroes traipse through the forbidding woods hoping to somehow kill this indestructable beast, I remembered thinking...""They are so cool.""
The movie's premise is unbelievable, several scenes are laughably bad and the gratuitous violence is unpleasant to say the least. But even today, 30 years removed from the cramped mall theater, George, Jaeckel and Prine versus The Grizzly is still oddly....""cool.""

227330,5,630018675X,"I saw Grizzly, or Claws as it is known as here in the United Kingdom, 5 years ago. I really enjoyed it. It is one of many American B movies, that tries to steal some of the audience that Jaws captured.
The story centres round an 18ft bear which goes around eating people and really thats it. This movie I'm sure at the time frightened people, but now it's more amusing than frightening. Christopher George is the only cast member I have heard of, and he is very good in this movie.
Unfortunately this movie like so many 1970's B movies, has not aged well. The picture is perfect, but it's the style of filming and close ups, and big hair that date it.

227334,3,630018675X,"Like Leonard Maltin says, this is an undeniable JAWS rip-off. Of all the JAWS clones ever made, this one is perhaps the most simular, even despite  the fact that it's set entirly on dry land. Basically, the shark becomes a  bear, the beach becomes a national park, the swimmers and boaters become  campers and hunters, the cheif of police becomes a forest ranger, and the  shark expert becomes (yep, you guessed it,) a bear expert. One significant  difference, however, is that, while in JAWS, only one victim was female,  most of the people killed in this film-the first four, in fact-are women,  so I don't recomend this one to anybody who is easily offended by films in  which women don't have much to do except die. One woman, a forest ranger  who is sent with others to hunt for the bear after the first attack,  foolishly asumes that, because she and her partner/lover haven't found him  (the bear) yet, he's nowhere nearby. She stops to skinny-dip in a stream  while the man leaves to keep searching alone. Sure enough, the bear finds  the woman alone, nude, (as any horror movie fan will tell you, women who  unclothe during a scary flick never survive) and kills her. There are some  decent scares, like after the above mentioned victim dies and we see her  blood flow into the stream, or during the first attack when one woman is  getting ready to pack up her tent while camping and the bear's right behind  her, or when her friend comes back and finds her dead body hanging in the  trees.
