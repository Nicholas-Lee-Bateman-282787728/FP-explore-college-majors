5466177,5,B00APQGP1W,"is it a drama, or comedy, or musical that fhighlights the classics?  Yes to all three. June Allyson is part of a Orchestra that travels and plays for our servicemen during WWII. Margaret O'Brien plays her young sister who pays a visit. Without spoiling this film, it's one of the best films I have, made in 1944, and O'brien went on to win a special Oscar that year for this and two other films she made. The Delightfull Jimmy Durante and Jose Iturbi round out the players that makes it a unique film to own.",1364169600,7,508,4.347368421052631

5466180,1,B00APQGP1W,"Purchased this in February 2015 and it lasted almost a year. My sister loved it so I ordered another one for her, received February 26, 2016. It doesn't work after only  three playings. I'm torn about ordering again  but she wants it. Is it just this particular recording? Naturally Amazon says its too late to return it.
I'm not happy about this.",1460851200,2,347,4.580645161290323

5466184,5,B00APQGP1W,"A sweet, sweet movie.  Margaret O'Brien is simply wonderful in this classic.  She pairs well as June Allyson's little sister.  O'Brien could have been as big as Shirley Temple but Hollywood didn't know what to do with two child wonders during the same time period.  Everyone would like to have a little sister like her.  ...Jimmy Durante, there will never be another.  He was the epitome of vaudeville, a true delight to see again in this movie as his happy personality shines through in every scene he is in.  This is an inspiring Easter movie with a tender message of mercy to those that believe.  It's different and most enjoyable with the classical music and performances of the piano and conductor great, Jose Iturbi.  Everyone is beautiful in this movie.  I think you will love this innocent movie about our talented female musicians standing in the gap for our young men who were drafted or enlisting during the WWll years.",1427760000,2,930,4.75625
5466185,5,B00APQGP1W,Margaret O'Brian is one of my favorites and she's at her best in this movie.,1427328000,,76,4.133333333333334

The music and entertainment in the movie can't be beat.",1412467200,,190,4.428571428571429
5466188,5,B00APQGP1W,"This a delightful movie with two of my favorite movie stars, June Allyson and Margaret O'Brien.  Margaret was such a good little actress for her young age and June is always a joy to watch.  The story line is great and wholesome.  This is a movie that can be watched by young and old and everyone will feel good about it when it is over.",1408665600,,337,4.153846153846154
5466189,3,B00APQGP1W,"A nice film with a lot of good music in it.  The acting was ok considering the story line and the main characters involved.  The studio was attempting to use Margaret as a Shirley Temple copy but did not have the cuteness or talent to compete, however it was a nice movie either way.",1404086400,2,283,4.222222222222222
5466190,4,B00APQGP1W,I enjoy older films. The cast of characters in this film are wonderful.  The story is slow to start but makes up for it later in the film with everyone enjoying the youngest character in the film. Love Jimmy Durante.,1401667200,,216,4.4

5466195,5,B00APQGP1W,"The premise of this film is a great wartime story. The half is lovely, but unless you LOVE pianists, Jose Iturbi's solo performances really wear thin, each number seemingly longer than the last. Iturbi plays his way through the entire film and June Allyson isn't utilised enough. Still a nice film, not one to watch over and over though..",1382140800,,338,4.745762711864407

8555788,5,B00APQGP1W,"I love this movie.  I've watched many old movies and love this one.  It is very heart-warming and a movie of faith and hope.  It isn't one of the popular old movies,  but one of my favorites.  The music is wonderful!
