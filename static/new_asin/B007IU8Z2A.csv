5089736,2,B007IU8Z2A,The movie puts down the catholic schools and it has disgusting comments. It is really stupid humor if you could call it humor. I didn't even end up watching the whole thing because it was so bad.,1370995200,,195,4.297297297297297
5089737,3,B007IU8Z2A,The movie itself is a great movie bit it would only play on one of my dvd players. The others just keep ejecting it.,1358640000,,116,3.875
5089738,4,B007IU8Z2A,"This is a teen romantic comedy a notch below and less universal appeal than ""An Easy A."" Adam (Josh Henderson) has a girlfriend Cynthia Swensen (Jaci Twiss). She dumps him for bad boy Marc Dixon (Abraham Taylor). This leads Adam to believe all women love the ""bad boy"" or jerk in this case. He does quite well being a jerk, of course playing in a band and being the lead singer never hurts either. Pretty girls throw themselves at him, but he wants Molly (Jenna-Dewan-Tatum) who plays hard to get and demands respect.

The scene talks place at a Catholic school with the occasional D.E.B.S. fantasy outfits. Tom Arnold plays a priest who occasional misspeaks in sexual innuendos, such as ""So concludes my unit on procreation"" or ""Easier than a prom date.""

Danny Bonaduce plays himself in what I thought was the funniest scene in the film. The script is predictable. It also lends itself to some old fashion dating protocol while contrasting it with what not to do. Not a blockbuster, but it was entertaining.

PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, no sex, no nudity (rear male shot, bot on thong). Sexual themes, but no parental embarrassing sex talk. Seems to be a light PG-13.",1344729600,3,1169,4.720588235294118
5089739,5,B007IU8Z2A,"What I would have wanted to know before I bought this film?

It wasn't the best made movie I have ever seen but at the end of the day I judge movies by the way they make me feel.

This one made me smile.

There were ""Never been kissed"" moments. (You know when you have to hide your head in your pillow because you are so embarrassed for the character.)

There were ""What the heck?!? This guy is an idiot!"" moments.

But overall I felt for the characters and their relationships, I empathized with their situation and I wanted it to work out for them.

Summary.... Watch it, take it for what it is, and enjoy.",1340496000,5,608,4.198275862068965

8517859,5,B007IU8Z2A,"I watched this movie with my kids the other night on netflix. Weve watched a ton of movies on Netflix and its getting harder and harder to find good movies to watch. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. The jerk theory is very true. I remember in my highschool days I had always wanted the jerk. My oldest son was trying to take tips on the jerk theory, and I was glad to see that the boy in the movie turned out to be a sweetie in the end. The main character Adam, had a beautiful voice and I thought it was a very cute movie and had some important lessons hidden in it. If you are looking for a movie to watch on Netflix Id recommend watching this.",1432252800,,663,3.992481203007519

8517863,3,B007IU8Z2A,"A teen local pop-star was left by a girl just to find himself attracted to another one.

I like American comedies of schoolies having hot time in their cars (also it is mostly Hollywood happenings), but this story sounds boring to me also music adds pleasure to nothing-for-watching visual acts.",1379721600,,295,4.9
