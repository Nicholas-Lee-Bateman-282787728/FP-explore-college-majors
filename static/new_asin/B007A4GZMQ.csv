But mainly the problem is most people who would be interested in this film will probably be people interested in the life of St Paul, who converted to Christianity after a shocking and life changing experience. He went from hating and killing Christians to loving them and defending Christ like no one else and suffered much in the process.
Unfortunately this hollywood version is so messed up, you may not even know it's St Paul. Look elsewhere if you want something historically accurate. It's worse then wanting to watch a movie on St Nicholas and only seeing Santa Claus. All the early Christian figures are distorted, and is an inaccurate reflection of history. Plus in not rated PG.",1352160000,,794,4.845588235294118
