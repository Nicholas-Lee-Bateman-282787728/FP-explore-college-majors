1975485,5,B000171RAE,"Its about time someone woke up and put one of, if not the greatest cop shows of all time on dvd format. I heard  the first season 5 dvd set will include the Pilot episode. Cant get any better then that. A while back, I purchased S&H on VHS thru Colombia House. They are great, but nothing beats seeing the candy apple red Ford Grand Torino tearing up the streets in digital format. Awesome, cant wait. I have been waiting a long time for this.

1975486,5,B000171RAE,"Well like many here I am off a certain age and remember fondly this ""buddy"" detective show from the 70's. This was one of the first and probably the best crime series at that time to come out of America and adorn British Television with it's fast talk, instant action, lots of gun battles and the good guys, are two intrepid heroes, always getting their man and often the girl. Yes of course the writing was cliched, the acting hammy and probably bore little resemblance to what police work was really like in downtown LA at that time but it certainly give a glimpse into the seedier life and even seedier locations of the City of Angels. The sets  looked very dated and even David Soul's residence at Venice Beach appeared to have been furnished by the salvation army! But we loved those two wise talking, fun cops (no he's Starsky, I'm Hutch) we laughed at the antics and the ""walk"" of their good friend the charismatic ""Huggy Bear"" and we rode along with Starsk in his beautiful ""striped tomato"" Ford Torino. This first season contains the controversial episode when Hutch becomes addicted to heroin and I cannot remember it ever being shown on British TV so it's good to see it as part of this series. It's even better to note that the complete collection is now available as a stand alone box set for less than 18...and I for one am just about to order as soon as I close this review. So if you want some great entertainment and some even better nostalgia from a couple of really cool guys this is the show for you :))",1472860800,,1523,4.439285714285714

I even wrote a letter to Paul Michael Glaser asking him to contact my parents on my behalf telling them it was okay for me to watch it with my friends.  Unfortunately, Paul Michael Glaser didn't step it, and I survived, even at the time I didn't think I would.  I vowed that one day I would watch this show and see what all of my friends were talking about at school the morning after it aired.  When I saw it on Amazon I knew I had my chance!  I loved watching it just because I had waited so long - I even remember some of the story lines my friends had told me about.  One in particular I remember is Starsky falling in love with a girls who dies and leaves her teddy bear to Hutch and to look over along with Starsky.  I remember all the girls at school crying.

1975531,3,B000171RAE,"At least in my book, only 1 episode is memorable.

I'm referring to Episode No. 20, entitled ""Jo-Jo."" That's Jo-Jo, the psycho-rapist who spray paints his victims' blouses orange before he sexually attacks them (and after he physically abuses them).

S & H finally manage to catch Jo-Jo in the act and throw his behind in the pokey. But shortly thereafter, the feds, who had him under surveillance, have him released, hoping that he'll lead them to a crime kingpin. S & H catch wind of this, and after balling out the feds for letting the dirtbag back out on the streets, they go hunting for the vicious monster.

So they find him, throw 'em in the front seat of their car (with Hutch to his left and Starsky to his right), and take him to a greasy spoon restaurant that is a favorite of Starsky's, where they read him the riot act (they let the dirtbag know they're watching him, and tailing him, and that if they catch him attempting to try anything they'll turn him into ""swiss steak"").

I don't want to reveal any additional detail as to what goes on at the greasy spoon, where S & H and Jo-Jo are waited on by an unforgettably insufferable waitress, but I will state that this is the best scene of the entire 23 episode first season, and perhaps the best of the entire series.

This episode was written by the extraordinarily talented Michael Mann, who started out in television as a writer and producer on shows such as Police Story and Miami Vice. He eventually became a much honored film director, turning out quality flicks such as Heat, The Insider, and The Last of the Mohicans. If you're familiar with Mann's work, you'll recognize Mann's stamp all over this episode.

As for Jo-Jo, you shall not soon forget him. Jo-Jo makes a lot of the other t.v. screen villains from this era look like Bob Barker.

As for the actor that played Jo-Jo, I don't know who he is, but he did a great job; and I wouldn't be surprised if this role was probably some kind of career-high for him. I wonder where he got the authenticity from? (Probably spends all of his free time on Rikers Island.)

Lastly, as for the series in general, I liked it from the very beginning and there are many quality episodes in the first season; however, in my opinion, the series did not come fully into its own until the second season.",1418774400,,2311,4.459715639810427

1975559,3,B000171RAE,"This 1975-76 Season of this police drama that ran on ABC from 1975-79 is the season that started this rough-and-tumble, wildly entertaining world of STARSKY & HUTCH, impatient cops--anxious to join a foot race in pursuit of a villain--throw themselves out of moving vehicles and roll to a bruising stop.

Undercover police investigators Det. Dave Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser) and Det. Ken ""Hutch"" Hutchinson (David Soul), hardly imbued with the powers of Spider-Man, routinely scale walls, hop from rooftop to rooftop, and fling themselves down steep hillsides to stop bad guys from doing what bad guys do.

Two years before Hill street blues  redefined the cop genre as a mesh of overlapping storylines and workaday frustrations, Aaron Spelling's STARSKY & HUTCH capped a 4-year run on ABC from 1975-79 portraying LA's finest as madly heroic creatures of reckless determination and physicality.

This 1975-1976 Season reminds us how startlingly brutal this primetime series could be while maintaining a delightful, often incongruous, self-deprecating humor.

From the series pilot on, partners and best pals STARSKY & HUTCH work a fine line between predator and prey, relentlessly pursuing suspects while also snared by crime chieftains or short-sighted superiors. In ""The Fix,"" Hutch's secret romance with the former girlfriend of a mafia boss (Robert Loggia) results in the lawman's kidnapping and forced addiction to heroin.

Similarly, in ""A Coffin for Starsky,"" a mad chemist injects the wisecracking cop with a slow-acting but lethal poison. ""Jo-Jo,"" written by Michael Mann, finds our guys at loggerheads with federal officers over a dumb deal the G-Men make with a serial rapist.

The 23 episodes in this set are all fun, if sometimes shocking, viewing. Expect each character to take as much abuse as he dishes out. Still, the comic sight of STARSKY & HUTCH (in ""Death Notice"") trying to conduct business amidst busy strippers is well worth the surrounding violence.

You can also see these episodes complete & uncut as well as commercial-free without getting all those deleted scenes you'd get when STARSKY & HUTCH was shown in reruns on TNT, TNN, and now Cozi-TV.",1387497600,3,2175,5.247838616714698

1975584,5,B000171RAE,"I bought the DVD's for S&H a couple of years ago, and have recently been re-watching them (along with re-runs of the show currently showing on RTV), and I really am amazed how well this show holds up so many years later.  You can see the recycled cop storylines throughout the years from cop show to cop show, but S&H was so unique in it allowing it's 2 lead characters to honestly and truly care about each other.  Possibly TV's first true (and strongest) 'bromance' as they call it today, the relationship between Starsky and Hutch was the glue the held the show together.  As a fan of the show, you have to be commited to that relationship as well in order to completely enjoy it for all that it is.

The show was also important for it's Captain.  It wasn't common place in the 1970's to see a black man in a position of power on TV. Captain Dobey not only fit that role, but did it with class and honesty with a fun streak tossed in.  He was respected by those he commanded (he cared about them as well) and he was a well rounded family man.  He was a much needed and much welcomed part of TV history.

S&H was also unique in that it tackled difficult issues without backing away from them with easy answers.  Drug addiction (""The Fix"" is easily one of most powerful and controversial episodes of the show), homosexuality (in a brilliant and powerful episode called ""Death in a Different Place""), alcoholism, violent crimes against children, death of loved ones, etc.  It never made light of the issues and always treated them with a respect that one would not expect from a show of the 1970's.

As someone else wrote in a review down below, you won't see a show like this ever again on television.  Sure it was corny at times and there are a few episodes that just fall flat (what show doesn't have those?), but in the end, it's a show that is not afraid of itself and one that cared about the characters and their relationships above all else.",1338249600,4,1949,4.383333333333334

1975587,5,B000171RAE,"I bought all four seasons of Starsky and Hutch. Having just finished watching Season 1 (I probably haven't seen most of these episodes for 30+ years) I had forgotten how charismatic David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser were together.

Whether you think the series is dated or not, no one can deny it set a brand new trend in TV--the ""bromance"". Starsky and Hutch were very touchy feely for two cops and I think no one had ever seen this on TV before.

Yeah, some of the filming was cartoonish. After all, the 3rd star of the show was a red Ford Torino with a giant white stripe. (Glaser hated the car so much he purposely ran into everything he could to try and destroy it). I was amazed at how physical the actor's roles were--they did a lot of running and jumping and chasing bad guys. Studios probaly wouldn't even allow their stars to do this today because of insurance issues!

All in all, I really enjoyed Season 1 from beginning to end and am looking forward to watching S2,3 and 4. If you have a fondness for 70's TV, Starsky and Hutch S1 will bring a smile to your face. If it doesn't then you must be too young to appreciated the time and the place.",1326326400,,1157,4.298165137614679
1975588,5,B000171RAE,"Although Lalo Schifrin's grim, downbeat main theme is not as cheekily catchy as Tom Scott's theme for seasons two and four, the show is still a hoot to watch. From the get-go, the ensemble cast blends perfectly, and the opening credits are a riot.

The opening credits are hilarious because, although the show is called Starsky & Hutch, the guy who plays Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser) and drives the flashy red and white-striped Ford Gran Torino is the second actor listed. David Soul (Hutch) gets top billing, and over a freeze frame of him yelling and flailing his arms maniacally.

Antonio Fargas, who plays nightclub-owning street informant Huggy Bear, gets special standout billing (""and Antonio Fargas as Huggy Bear""). But then, all of a sudden, the credits list Bernie Hamilton (the irascible but lovable Captain Dobey). That's it - just Bernie Hamilton. It's like the credits are saying, ""...and Antonio Fargas as Huggy Bear - oh, by the way, Bernie Hamilton.""

There's more to the show than just the hilarious opening credits, and certainly much more than the insipid, shallow, and unworthy big-screen Starsky & Hutch parody starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Stiller and Wilson may be funny (not really), but they're no David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser. Soul and Glaser are solid actors with great screen chemistry, and Glaser is a better and more accomplished film and television director.

Even if you're not into TV cop shows or don't particularly care for Starsky & Hutch, at least just check out the opening credits. It's one of the more entertaining highlights of classic 1970s television.",1320105600,2,1610,5.0187265917602994
1975589,5,B000171RAE,"Starsky: ""It's in my report.""
Captain Dobey: ""Oh yeah, about this report, it reads like a comic book, 'The fiery red Torino fishtails to a halt. We spill onto the street ready for action'. (tosses report at Starsky) What is this?""

On DVD for the first time in a stunning 5-disc set, ABC's Starsky & Hutch (original working title ""Nightside"" about two cops who only worked the night shift) was and remains a highly enjoyable 70s cop show from super-producer Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. The series benefited greatly from the casting of its two leads, Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul in the iconic title roles. Their genuine chemistry and interactions with not only each other but with co-stars Bernie Hamilton (Captain Harold Dobey) and Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear) as well as the guest stars propel the smartly written and directed episodes from such notables as Michael Mann and Barry Shear respectively.

A common misconception among potential TV DVD buyers is that 70s cop shows like Starsky & Hutch don't age well and can't hold a candle to modern shows of the genre. Having watched the show back then and now, I'm glad to report that these first season episodes are every bit as entertaining (if not more) than any show of the genre today thanks to a great cast & crew and a good balance of action, drama, and humor. Not to mention the somewhat menacing opening & closing theme music by veteran composer Lalo Schifrin (Mission Impossible). The groundbreakingly dark and gritty first season also includes the following lineup of guest stars:

1975597,5,B000171RAE,"As someone who was born years after this series ended, it's odd to me to be writting a review to praise something that, to many people, must seem simple and out-dated. In light of the drama and action of modern television, I doubt there are many fans of Starsky and Hutch under 30, but for those few of us that are out there, I'll try and put it in a modern light.

  First of all, this series is great for what it is: an original buddy-cop series that came about in the seventies and was filmed with one camera, and was heavily editted for T.V. Unlike some of the more gritty series of today, there is no graphic violence or obvious sex (although the hints are certainly there), so I'd recommend it for a more casual look, or for younger audiences not already used to blood and gore. It's pleasant and fun, and, while not exactly suspenseful, interesting enough to keep you watching if you start.

  Second, this is quite the revolutionary series, and, even if it isn't your thing, it probably should be watched for that alone. It was one of the first series with a mixed race cast, with policemen who didn't just follow the rules, and a sign of the times to people who didn't grow up in the midst of the seventies (from clothes to portion sizes to slang). From an entertainment standpoint, it's leaps and bounds above Beretta (similar idea, also funny) and historically, it has much more to offer than any of the contrived police shows of today.

And, finally, it is almost relaxing to watch. The episodes change from light and funny to somewhat more on the side of edgy, but there's none of the ego of modern shows where, if you miss one episode, you have no idea what's going on. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's a popcorn-series, not an addicting one (not compared to shows like House or Supernatural or Psych).

  Besides that, season one is the best, like many series. They were still trying to get that second season, so the episodes are somewhat more intense than in other seasons, although season four has a bit more meat to it as far as changes to their careers and their health (can't get over that mustache, though.)",1237507200,3,2140,4.450127877237851

It is not only because of the GRAN TORINO ,which became a cult item for collectors. If you remember 1975-76,we had lost IRONSIDE,MANNIX and HAWAI5-0 was starting to wind down when those two cops arrived on the scene. Sure we had KOJAK,but STARSKY and HUTCH were younger and could really compete physically with the criminals and chase them everywhere. We had HUGGY BEAR for comic relief,DOBEY the captain who has a strange fixture towards food and often interrupts STARSKY's meals ,who is himself a fast food addict. Mostly,STARSKY and HUTCH had great chemistry and as the season progress ,you also discover the human side of their characters. Although they are heterosexuals,there are some homosexual overtones in some of their scenes together that completely eluded me back then. It is funny sometimes to discover how time changes perception.

1975614,3,B000171RAE,"This is a silly but somewhat funny spoof based on that seventies something television series by the same name, which starred Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch) in the lead roles. In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.

Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch. Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.

The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way. Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.

The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal. Those who liked the Starsky and Hutch television series or who are fans of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson will probably enjoy this goofy, spoofy, sophomoric little film.",1149379200,,2537,4.761363636363637

1975622,5,B000171RAE,"I'm sure I'm just one of many lonely 30 somethings that want to look to the past because the present state of television is more sad than funny and is generally unwatchable. I have wanted to try so many of these old shows out but just didn't want to take a $40 plunge only to be unhappy. Enter Netflix. While this may seem like a plug for the company it really isn't, for I have to actually BUY the sets I love from Amazon:) So far it's been pretty hit or miss, each time I just try the first disc to get an idea of ""the show"" in question.

Kung Fu was the first and I was pleased, making a mental note I must buy that series as soon as possible and still plan too. Then came Baretta and honestly Blake is quite good in that but the show isn't that strong, plus his wacky costumes are simply silly. Next was SWAT... it was dull, flat, and almost made me rethink the whole thing... can you go home? I have a deep love for Columbo because that IS on in reruns but the above shows just seemed to lack THAT level of likeability...

Then Starsky and Hutch Disc One Season One came. I thought ""well it can't be any worse than SWAT."" Within 10 minutes of the pilot I knew I had found gold. Instant chemistry, humor, action, and decent dialogue abounded. Hard to describe my jubilation, kind of like a miner who had hit a vein I suppose. When these older shows are good, they are great. I fail to see how it is possible to cast a show and have it seem like the leads have been raised together! Paul Glaser and David Soul are just perfect. It's no different than Kirk and Spock, Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton, and many others that simply HAVE IT. As far as casting this type of thing, it is no doubt luck, OUR good luck:)

Well, after watching that first Disc I quickly sent it back and KNEW I HAD TO buy this set. This show simply put is everything I watch TV for. Having gone through the first 2 discs and peeking at the extras on Disc 5 I couldn't be happier. The Fix and Kill Huggy are stand outs and while I could complain that they didn't remaster the sound in 5.1 like a MUCH older Star Trek ('66-69) I think I'll just be happy to have found new friends and leave it at that.",1111536000,2,2171,4.091549295774648
1975623,5,B000171RAE,"For true 'Starsky & Hutch' fans, this is an excellent box set. I give it 5 out of 5 stars simply because any fan of 'S&H' will no doubt love it.

  'Starsky & Hutch' was a ground-breaking show when it debuted in 1975. Based loosely on the early-70s TV movie 'Super-Cops', itself a true-life inspired story, 'Starsky & Hutch' blended the buddy-formula that worked so well in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', as well as 'The Sting' with the conventions of TV cop show simplicities, throwing in a lot of personal touches along the way.

  Critics initially lambasted the show for being little more than an ultra-violent shoot-em-up peppered with endless car chases, but the sincere sensitivity displyed by the main characters, fleshed out by the very-likable leads Paul Michael Glaser as 'Starsky' and David Soul as 'Hutch', as well as supporting cast Antonio Fargas as thier snitch-buddy 'Huggy Bear'(he was NOT a pimp!)and Bernard Hamilton as thier tough-as-nails 'Captain Dobey' was enough to take the hard 'edge' off of the violent action that would have quickly become boring and uninteresting.

  The TV show 'S.W.A.T.', another Spelling-Goldberg production airing during 1975 was also initially a huge hit, packed with even more of the audience-grabbing uber-violence. Unfortunately, that show did not have the talents or likeability of a cast like Glaser, Soul, Fargas and Hamilton to give it any lasting appeal, and it was soon gone from the air-waves.

  What gave this show it's lasting appeal was the near-perfect balance of action, friendship, humor and drama, all capped off with theme music, as well as incidental episode music that was far and away the best ever used on an hour long weekly cop series up until that time.

  The opening theme music for the first season, as well as much of this season's incidental music was by the award-winning Lalo Schifrin, most famous for his unforgettable them to 'Mission: Impossible', as well as his jazzy theme for the private-detective series 'Mannix', starring Mike Conners. Schifrin also was responsible for the award winning scores from both 'Dirty Harry', the Clint Eastwood film and 'Bullit', the Steve McQueen actioner famous for its near-perfect 15-minute car chase scene through the streets and hills of San Francisco.

 Along with Schifrin's unbeatable contributions, many other famous film composers contributed to the 'Starsky & Hutch' sound during its freshman season.

  Probably the most amazing thing about the first season of 'Starsky & Hutch' is the fact that of the 23 episodes, only two of the stories were written originally for this show.

  This show was cutting-edge for its time, tackling subjects rarely, if ever shown on a typical hour long TV show before.

  Of the entire first season, almost every episode is a classic, with no stinkers in the bunch.

  The biggest treat to fans for this set is the inclusion of the rarely-seen pilot episode. Like most pilot shows, there are a few differences from the series once it was underway, but they are very few and barely noticeable. In other words...they got it right from the beginning and didn't have to 'fix it' when it became a series. The most obvious change is that 'Dobey' is played by Richard Ward in the pilot, who was unavailable for the series. Bernie Hamilton then became the beloved 'Dobey' for the entire 4-year run of the series. The pilot is a little more gritty and rough than what the series was, but all the elements are clearly in place. After all these years, seeing the pilot again is a real treat!

 Unlike most cop-shows from the era, 'Starsky & Hutch' gave its two leads plenty of opportunities for some real acting by letting the characters show flaws, hesitations and quirks along with the usual heroic and unflinching abilities of most TV cops.

 'The Fix' is probably one of the best hours of episodic drama ever produced for American televison, even by today's standards. As revenge for 'stealing' his girlfriend, a viscious and insanely jealous mobster gets Hutch strung-out on heroin, simply to get him to reveal where Hutch is hiding her. David Soul's performance in this episode is a tour-de-force display as he takes the viewer through every harrowing stage of Hutch's ordeal from being kidnapped, shot-up while blindfolded, beaten to near-death while high, and eventually left for dead as a strung-out junkie too weak and disoriented to even know who his friends are. This episode was so disturbing it was banned from all European broadcasts of 'Starsky & Hutch' until the early 1990s!

 'Texas Longhorn' tells the story of good ole' boy millionaire car-dealership owner 'Zack Tyler', who's wife is brutally raped and murdered. Instead of the typical TV show rage and anger, Zack's sedate and disturbing depression draws so much sympathy from Starsky & Hutch (as well as the audience!) that it is hard to find fault with him for hunting down the rapists responsible for his wife's death. Another touching episode.

 'Deadly Imposter' features the awesome Canadian-actor Art Hindle as Starsky & Hutch's friend John Colby from thier police-academy days. Colby's surprise return to Bay City, asking his pals Starsky & Hutch to help him find his ex-wife and son is in reality a cover for the fact that he is now a highly-paid assassin, using his friends Starsky & Hutch to unknowingly help him track down a mob informant marked for assassination...by Colby! The hand-to-hand combat between two former close friends on the beach at the end of the episode is startlingly realistic and quite dramatic. Another great episode!

  'The Hostages' tells the suspenseful story of a young armored car driver(John Ritter) and his pregnant wife being held hostage who will be killed unless he turns in all the money from the day's pick-ups. A well-acted and well paced race-against-time episode.

  These are only a few of the great episodes, and my favorites from this season. But rest assured...every episode from this set is a great one!

  The over-riding theme set up during the first season is that 'Starsky & Hutch' are truly best friends, not just co-workers. They would willingly give thier life for each other if necessary, and thier dedication to each other, as well as 'doing the right thing', even if it means bending the rules a bit is inspirational and makes the characters seem like real people.

 Glaser and Soul ARE 'Starsky & Hutch' and are unforgettable. Stiller and Wilson were just acting.

  The picture quality and sound on this set is generally excellent. Some artifacts from the original source films are present, mostly in the opening credits on some episodes.

  The packaging is pretty nice, with a colorful box, a nice fold-out section to hold the 5 discs, and plenty of close-ups of the famous Torino to look at. Unfortunately for true aficianados, the Gran Torino used on the package is the version used in the new Stller and Wilson 'Starsky & Hutch' movie, not the 'real' Torino from the TV show. That's undestandable, since the original cars are owned by a collector and are in original, unrestored condition...meaning they are pretty rough! In fact, there is a short featurette in the 'special features' all about these origianl cars.

 The 'special features' also includes a nice up-to-date set of all-new interviews with Glaser, Soul, Fargas and the producers. Very enlightening!

 The only sore spot for me is the 'Original TV Promo Spots' included. They are in fact NOT original 'promo spots', but are actually the promo spots produced in 1980 as part of the syndication package for the entire series. Its still cool to see them though.

 If you are a fan of 'Starsky & Hutch' this set is for you. You will definately enjoy it, so just get it.

1975634,5,B000171RAE,"Great cop show, amazing car chase and good fight scenes. Loaded with humor and 70's pop culture. I will not repeat the good things people have already pointed out.

Don't compare it with the Ben Stiller (who is a fine actor and actually imitated Starsky's walk really well) and Owen Wilson movie Starsky and Hutch - the movie does not do justice to the show. Yes, we all know that the movie is more of a spoof but still the characters can't portray what Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul brought to this hit show. The stories have a lot of substance into them and it not just some show with fast car, shooting people etc. - there are several dialogues/lines/scenes that force us to think of various painful issues that are present in the society - especially in the later seasons.

You will not regret buying it. It is a must have for any fan of good cop shows with sensitive characters that are passionate about their work. The show is pure fun.",1109116800,5,947,4.436781609195402

1975636,5,B000171RAE,"It's good set and has 23 episodes of the show. My favorite episode is episode 2 Savage Sunday where a senior-citizen couple put 50 sticks of dynamite in the back of their White Impala to blow up city hall but 2 homicidal thieves Wilbur Sloan and Gregg Morton steal their car and don't know that there are dynamite in the trunk. Things get kind of worse when they take it to Ted's Body & Fender repair shop and paint the Chevy green and change the plates to Ohio plates. And another good one is episode 14 The Deadly Imposter where Starsky & Hutch's long lost buddy returns to town dressed as a General who is actually contracted to kill his ex-wife's husband. So those are good episodes. The one I didn't like was Running, that was a pretty sad one too when an alchoholic model who Starsky was in love with in High School was almost killed by a loose killer but when Starsky hides her in his apartment to protect her, she's the only person to identify the killer. But anyway, I got this on my birthday which was on December 9 along with SNL Adam Sandler. I finished watching the entire 5 disc set. It says it's 20 hours this 5-piece-disc set. And also on the 5th disc, it has special features like new interviews with Starsky & Hutch, pictures of the movie Starsky & Hutch and also talking about the 3rd star which is Starsky & Hutch's Red & White Ford Torino. And I saw another Ford Torino in one of the episodes, I can't remember which episode that was but I think it was episode 16 The Hostages. But anyway this is a good set. After you watch this one, you'll probably be wanting for the 2nd Season. I haven't seen the 2nd Season yet but I bet it's good and I think it's out now.",1103760000,2,1682,4.259375

S&H accurately portrayed the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, giving it a sort of ""To Live and Die in L.A."" feel, with an added touch of humor. I had fun picking out guest stars who went on to bigger fame.

Sure, some of the production values were cheesy--such as Starsky wearing the same clothes for several episodes, and a green Chevy Impala blowing up one week and then appearing in the next episode--but this was 70's TV, people! They kept production costs down by reusing props and shooting several episodes in a day. Try that with the cast of Friends. HA!

Beyond the main characters and the really COOL car my memories about the particular episodes were fuzzy to say the least.  Thank goodness I bought this set though as over the past few nights as I review each episode I can see exactly why I loved this show so much as a youngster.
You have to remember when (what era) this show was filmed in...some of the clothes are certainly dated, but when I look in clothing store windows in Toronto I see alot of retro styles that could easily have been in an episode or two... You have to get beyond all the supposedly rich ""bad guys"" wearing ""Herb Tarlic""-test pattern suits though.
Unlike the new movie, the old stories are very serious, and fairly well written (Michael ""Miami Vice"" Mann wrote several episodes) although TV critics today would probably disagree about the quality of the shows.  The humour (exagerated in the movie, although it is very entertaining too!) comes from the banter and chemistry between the two lead actors, but does not overshadow the fact that this is a show about a couple of hard nosed cops.
The quality of the DVD transfer is excellent, and most of the DVD extras although sparse (I too would have liked audio commentaries) are well done.  The one about the car collector is a bit ridiculous though (it's quite obvious this man was ripped off as the car he proposes to be an ORIGINAL, has the wrong mirrors and a terrible paint job)  I would have expected the new movie car to be used for a documentary on the ""Third star"" of the series.  The movie one is a Beautiful restoration of a classic 70's icon and big American muscle car.
If you liked this series when you were younger, I believe you'll enjoy this walk down yours and TV history's memory lane...Watch for the continuity errors though (see the pool scene in the pilot)...they're everywhere!!",1080259200,,2040,4.562841530054645

I can't wait for the remaining seasons to come out on DVD so I can own the complete series. It's too bad we never got a Starsky and Hutch reunion show featuring one of TV's greatest cop duos. Each week they relied heavily on the word from the street from their number one informant Huggy Bear and answered to the hard nosed Captain Dobey when things went wrong. Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul will always be the greatest cop duo and the only Starsky and Hutch to ever hit the streets. Included in season one are the first 22 action packed episodes plus the series pilot. You're cheating yourself if you don't buy this fantastic show. Long live Starsky and Hutch!

(The other being ""Emergency!""). Looking at these episodes so crisply re-mastered, brings back a lot of memories of sighing longingly while gazing at Paul Michael Glaser (""Starsky"")..as my older sister pined for the dreamy David Soul (""Hutch""). I remember the excitement as a young child of waiting for ""my"" show to come on every Wednesday evening and discovering what ""messes"" my heroes were going to get into. Even back then, I appreciated the humor, loyal friendship and camaraderie of the two leads; two men who were never afraid to show or express their deep love and affection for each other. It is that element that has kept me a fan to this day.
As always, my favorite episodes involved angst or ""hurt/comfort""..and I eagerly awaited fan favorites such as, ""The Fix"", ""The Shootout"", and ""A Coffin for Starsky""; anything that expressed the heartfelt devotion and concern these two men had for each other. I know that in today's age, such overt displays of affection would be frowned upon amongst men..and certainly back then it was unique, unusual and different..but it is this very uniquely displayed vulnerability and CHEMISTRY amongst the gritty reality of their daily lives that made the show a winner for me, and still makes it so to this day. There has been, nor will there EVER be, a cop show to match the heart that this show had: two undercover cops whose priority to their jobs was surpassed only by their deep love and affection for each other. Their motto: ""Me and Thee"" sums up in a nutshell what this series was all about-friendship first. It warms my heart, also, to know that both Paul and David were and still are just as close offscreen. It makes watching these episodes all the more touching.

1975676,5,B000171RAE,"The friendship, baby.  That's what I'm talking about.  Sure, nowadays the plot lines are drab and predictable, but the way the boys handled it was pure class.  I enjoyed ""Snow Storm"", ""The Fix"" (for obvious hurt/comfort scenes between the guys) and ""Coffin For Starsky"" (ibid).  It was a series that was comical in many aspects (as season 4 portrayed), so the movie is, in all fairness, simply a take off from that perspective.  I enjoyed the movie and have seen it twice.  I believe they rewrote the characters to give them more appeal to today's audience (and as the audience has laughed throughout the movie both times I've seen it, it seems to be working), but the basic premise of the friendship is the same.  There's even a real touching moment when Hutch goes off and gets drunk after he and Starsky have a falling out.  I found myself going, ""Awww"" both times.  The series on DVD is what I've been waiting over 20 years for.  Uncensored, non-homophobic full length episodes.  Uncut.  Beautiful.  Let the guys and buddies touch, dog-gone it, it's not like they're gonna get married!  Then again...<G>  Sorry, had to say it. And when the movie comes out on DVD, I'll be the first to pre-order it.  For me, as a fan of the series, it's a must have in my collection.  Here's hoping the other 3 seasons of S and H come out on DVD soon.  I've already finished this one and am raring to go on the others.  Thanks ever so much!!",1078876800,2,1428,4.4863813229571985
1975677,3,B000171RAE,"I was never a fan of this show, although I watched it occasionally back in the day.  I bought this set from sheer nostalgia, curious to see how the show has aged.
My initial impression, after watching the first two episodes, is that TV has gotten a heck of a lot better in the last 30 years!  Sure we've got the reality shows and other mindless dreck, but we've also had inventive drama like ""The Shield"", ""The Sopranos"", ""Hill Street Blues"", and ""NYPD Blue"".  Compared to these more involving dramas, the cookie-cutter plots and formulaic caricatures of ""Starsky and Hutch"" are cartoonish.  Like ""Charlie's Angels"", (also produced by Spelling & Goldberg) this show was never meant to be taken seriously.
Like most 70s shows, there's a certain dowdiness hanging over the proceedings.  It's not the tacky fashions and haircuts --- those are half the fun!  It's the overall flatness of the performances, the limpness of the editing, the lack of realism, and a certain plodding pace that contrasts wildly with modern-day ""edge"" shows such as ""The Shield.""
Having said all that, there's nostalgic fun to be had here.  Almost every show I saw in the 70s had the same stylistic limitations.  Glaser and Soul are appealing, likeable leads; the sporty Gran Turino is a character in itself, the car chases are fun, the fashions and hairstyles are amusing, and of course Antonio Fargas, the blaxploitation character brought in to provide an ersatz ""hip"" factor, is perhaps the most talented actor on board (his subsequent career in films seems to have been more successful that Soul's or Glaser's).  If nothing else, ""Huggy Bear's"" unique facial features and remarkable nose are worth at least part of the admission price.
This is a beautifully mastered DVD set, and should please fans of the series.  This is highly recommended for those who did enjoy the show in the 70s, but will probably seem tame and corny to anyone under the age of 35.",1078876800,4,1932,4.844984802431611
1975678,5,B000171RAE,"I was so excited this finally came out on DVD!!  I just hope the other seasons come out as well!
I watched this show religiously as a teenager in the '70's.  There was nothing else like it on TV.  What made the show were the actors/characters.  The chemistry, the friendship, whatever you want to call it flew off of the screen.  In the mid '70's when all the guys were so macho, here were two guys who weren't afraid to show how they cared for each other - and at the same time remaining macho!  This was what the show was about.  Never mind that the plots were a little lame and pretty predictable.  My friends and I tuned in every week for 5 years to watch what went on between the two buddys.
The quality of the DVDs are excellent and I love the new interviews with Paul and David and Antonio.  Outakes would have been fun and I bet there were a lot of them!  Maybe on the next release of Season 2????
I won't go and see the movie.  I'm upset that Hollywood took a serious cop show and turned it into a farce.  I would much rather see Starsky & Hutch 20 years later.  What happened to them, where are they now kind of movie.  Maybe that would be something to think about???",1078790400,5,1177,4.127753303964758
1975679,4,B000171RAE,"Now that I've had a chance to watch all these again after SO many years, I've realized a few things: the show was funny (but not funny enough to warrant the theatrical version being a full-on comedy), there was a great camaraderie between the two guys, the plots were shallow, to solve a crime they always relied on ""tips"" from the types of people they should have been arresting as well, and the Torino was not seen as often as it should have been.
For me, it was all about the car, and during this first season I calculate that it is only seen for about 35% of the total time. I'm referring to everything from seeing it just parked to being in hot pursuit. There is one episode where it is not even present at all! I could have sworn it was used much more than that, but it's been a long time.
The storylines are not incredibly engaging, but they are fairly entertaining and the occasional bits of cornball humor keep it interesting. It is a shame that there was no real detective work going on, as the plots were easily resolved because all they needed to do was find some pimp or hooker who knew someone who knew the killer, and then it was over. A little too easy for me.
One cool point is that the shows were from back in the day when commercials weren't so damn intrusive, and episodes are 50 minutes each compared to today's 40+ minute scripts.
The extras are nice, but there aren't that many. The best being, of course, (IMHO) ""The Third Star"" which is a little snippet on the Torino. Judging by the first season and the Torino's lack of appearance, it seems that the ""car as star"" concept didn't really kick in until later on. The pilot episode bears the best use of the car out of all of them, and contains the scenes which make up the opening credits for the rest of the series.
Not as cerebral as NYPD Blue and its kin, but tons more fun, Starsky and Hutch is perhaps the definitive show of the 70s.",1078704000,,1912,4.2845303867403315
1975680,5,B000171RAE,"If you are a true Starsky and Hutch fan as I, you'll appreciate all the effort put forth in these DVD's. The quality is excellent, the restoration near perfect, there are a few clitches here and there but nothing that takes away from the episodes whatsoever.
  All the episodes that I have watched so far are uncut. Savage Sunday will be the true test if the extra footage is in there or not.
  The extra interviews are just the ticket given by Paul Glaser, David Soul and Antonio Fargus's insight/hindsight on the series, along with William Blinn and Aaron Spelling giving lengthy views on the development of the series and what in their opinions made the series such a success. Also to top things off, is an owner of one of the orginal show cars with a really detailed look at the car and what made it make such a lasting impression. (Makes me appreciate my 76 S&H Torino even more!)
  I can only hope that the rest of the series 2, 3 and 4 are also released subsequently with the same attention to quality as these were, buy and enjoy!",1078617600,2,1038,4.408376963350785
1975681,5,B000171RAE,"Although the upcoming movie will likely be entertaining, I prefer to go for the real deal. I've already viewed several episodes from the 1st season box set, and after 29 years, still recall most of these episodes, only because it was such a stand up series. In my opinion no other two actors blended as well as David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser, and between 1975 - 1979 they managed to mould a very unique television series, containing action, romance, drama, and even comedic moments. If you were too young to recall it, my advice is to purchase it, for the price its well worth every penny. A lot of extras with the DVD release, very nicely put together. It would be great to see these two together again. I encourage everyone to read David Souls letter on the interest of doing a film that presents a closure to this original superb series. I don't understand why they have never been approached? Get with it producers, because with the new movie and DVD release of the series, now is the time!

1975682,5,B000171RAE,"Just in time for the theatrical release is this handsomely packaged 5-CD set of the first season.  It is hard to imagine the movie will measure up to the series, although you can catch a glimpse of the movie in the extras included in this box set.  The series burst on the scene in the mid 70's.  Starsky and Hutch proved an instant hit as an entertaining police odd couple covering the streets of LA in their sporty red Gran Torino.  I was partial to Starsky myself.  Hutch a bit too straight laced, but the two played so well off each other, until success spoiled them in the later seasons.  Huggy was a great comic foil, and you will enjoy the numerous guest appearances in this series.  Interesting to see that Michael Mann wrote two of the early episodes: Texas Longhorn and Lady Blue.  He would later make his mark in Miami Vice.  But to me, Starsky and Hutch remains the best buddy cop show on TV, playing off the various cop movies of the time.  And you just can't beat that Gran Torino!",1078358400,2,995,4.358695652173913

I can't wait to see the shows on DVD!  The TNT re-runs were ok, but all the commercials!!!! My favorite episode and I think David Soul's best performance, was ""the fix"".  And Paul Michael Glaser's best was in ""shoot-out""! I recently bought the XBOX Video Game and got my son's interested in the new movie which we will go see.

There is one thing that I remember the most about this show, and of course it is the infamous ""Red Tomato"" or more importantly that Red Torino with the huge white stripe on the side that this show was known for. I can recall doing several rendtions of this car in my notebooks at school, and this DVD release looks really appealing to me. Lets hope the rest of the years come out later.",1077840000,,575,4.052631578947368
1975686,5,B000171RAE,"It sure is good to climb in to my time machine, sit back and get sent all the way back to a time when television was meant to be fun and entertaining.
This production is truly 1st class. As a graphic artist I can only imagine what fun the designers must have had in putting the packaging together. Creative! Strong layout! I'm jealous big time.
As a whole some one thought this entire thing out. This collection is put together solid and I am more than jazzed with the fact it was released as a complete season with the pilot movie. I loved the 1st season the best. I still remember the first time I saw the movie. I thought, ""these two dudes are so cool!"". Even though I was only about 12 or so I remember thinking this show was some how different. That it was special.
The access menus are enhanced by the best theme song of all 4 seasons. I could never figure out why they changed it. Lalo Shiffrin's work is mememorable, pure classic 70's t.v and movie sountrack. Although he is only given credit for the theme song I can catch hints of Enter the Dragon type pieces throughout the entire show. I'm not sure how decisions are made when it comes to putting these collections together but it seems to me that all the right ones were made here. The special features are too few but at least they exist. I like them all except the upcoming movie tie in. I think that it will eventually detract from the collection if the film ends being a flop. I do like the fact that both David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser are actually shown interacting with their movie versions. How often do you get to see that? My favorite feature is found on disc 5; the featurette called ""Harder than it looks""; classic, ""don't take TV too serious"" type bloopers, with a twist. To tell the truth there were a lot more bloopers that could have been added to the feature, I caught a few myself. But, I don't think that these bloopers make the show bad or detract from it. Times were different back then. Television was innocent. It wasn't all wrapped up in technical advisors and stuff like that. Television and movies nowadays have it made. With all the technological advancements that have been made in equipment, production and special effects. With the amount of knowledge available today actors nowadays have all of this technical and tactical training available to play a part but many times the one thing that lacks is the ability to act. Too much is spent on flash and not enough on substance. Starsky and Hutch was a show unto itself. After sitting through all 23 episodes I still feel the connection with the characters, even after all these years. Like I know them and I guess that is what attracted me to the show back then. The acting was very solid. The characters original. Raw and edgy, funny and real, not just another copy of a copy. It was a show that shaped a generation. Not the other way around.",1077667200,3,2889,4.432330827067669
1975687,5,B000171RAE,"Great job, throughout the DVD package.  20 hours of Starsky and Hutch has me rewinding my memory of when I was seven years old and watching the cops catch the bad guys.  Twenty three episodes from 1975.  The original pilot with Richard Ward playing Captain Dobey.  Richard Ward played the father in Steve Martin's The Jerk, but I remember him most in Brubaker, the Redford movie where he played a prisoner that had served too much time and coffin maker for the previous warden.  Gordon Jump also is in the pilot as a gym owner, before his jobs at WKRP and the Maytag repairman.  It has interviews of the creater William Blinn, Antonio Fargas, David Soul, and Paul Michael Glazer.  It even has a fan, who purchased one of the Torino's used for the show.  I didn't know the Gran Torino had a 460 engine.  Also, it has the tv promo spots telling about the next show.  That isn't done like it used to be, with the stars from the show teasing you about the next show.  Thanks to Amazon for delivering fast and with no problems.  Starsky and Hutch fans this is it, you are gonna love this set.  Now, it is time to start pressing for The Six Million Dollar Man set.  Where's Steve Austin, Oscar Goldman, and Lindsey Wagner?

1975688,5,B000171RAE,"Starsky and Hutch is perhaps one of the best cop shows of the '70s (there was a lot of competition then), and easily one of the best ever.  It's about time that it's finally received the digital treatment it has so long deserved.
This was probably the first police drama that showed that cops could also be close friends and actually hang out together and have social lives.  All cop shows previously were of the Quinn Martin/Jack Webb/Hawaii 5-0 variety, where everything was done by the book and the principals--although professional--were somewhat cold and very one-dimensional and superficial.  This was also the first cop drama that showed that sometimes the rules have to be bent a little bit (and arms and god-knows-what-else broken!) in order to get the job done.  Hey, it was rough out there on the mean streets of the 1970s.
This DVD set is a little piece of history.  The first season is generally considered the best of the four, so this is the one to get.  Lots of extras too, including an in-depth look at the Gran Torino that STILL has to be the coolest car ever telecast.",1077235200,24,1087,4.635416666666667
1975689,5,B000171RAE,"I remember enjoying this series with the highlight on Starsky's and Hutch's friendship and some great chase scenes.  I couldn't find out much about the DVD set from Columbia's website.  (I am writing this prior to release.)  They did say that the set is 1173 minutes long.  Here is  an episode guide which  I hope will be helpful. I  listed any  guest stars whose names I recognized.  However, they may have had a small part in the episode.
Here is an episode guide for Season 1, with a tiny description:

1975690,4,B000171RAE,"The first season of Starsky and Hutch was the best one.  This season had incorporated some humor (in the form of Huggy Bear) and was a fair buddy-cop show.  Later seasons lost the humor and the stars both wanted to not be buddy-buddy, and so the show developed into something less than what it was originally.
In any case, the first season DVD is something worth purchasing and has my recommendation.",1074297600,11,400,4.619718309859155
