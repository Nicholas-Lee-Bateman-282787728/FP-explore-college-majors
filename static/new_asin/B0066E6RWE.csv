4962018,4,B0066E6RWE,"I liked this DVD.  It is based upon William Shirer's book of a similar name.  I have not read the book.  It should be viewed along with the DVD called Chronical of the Third Reich and the old TV show now made into a DVD called The World at War (II).

4962019,5,B0066E6RWE,"Finally, the DVD edition of the superb version of the TNT special that was aired in the early 90s. I did video tape it at the time, but the tape bit the dust a decade ago. This is what I consider to be the granddaddy of the WWII documentaries. Everything about it is outstanding: the narration, the music, the editing. In particular, the music does an excellent job of getting the intended emotion across. I also like the interviews of actual participants scattered throughout. We see former world leaders recounting their experiences, what they felt and what they were thinking, and we also see middle-aged former Nazis repeating their justifications for voting for Hitler and ushering in the Nazi party. We also see interviews with Holocaust survivors regarding their experiences. To me, this DVD was worth every penny. It's head and shoulders above some of the modern ""exploitation"" knock-off DVDs that are in the $5 bargain bin today.

One minor note is that this DVD must be played on a dedicated DVD player. I have a DVD recorder/player, and it won't work on this. It also won't work on some computers. This is a security measure, I suppose, to prevent bootlegging. So you have to have a DVD play-only machine to view this. I haven't tried it on a Blu-ray player, because I don't have one.",1373932800,12,1295,4.730088495575221
4962020,5,B0066E6RWE,"I remember watching this program in the late 1970s--a (then) independent TV station in St. Louis aired it. I didn't have a video tape recorder then, so I never got to record it. I had never seen it air since, but I was so glad when I found out it was now available on DVD. ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" is one of my all-time favorite history books--in fact, one of the books I read when younger that encouraged my interest in history. The documentary series is real interesting. I saw a lot of footage I have not seen in later documentaries on this time, and seeing the interviews (with the likes of Putzi Hanfschtangel and Otto Strasser, plus William L. Shirer's commentary) makes this precious on that count alone. I always liked Richard Basehart's voice in narrating documentaries of this ilk--he really seemed to have a vocal gravitas that worked so well. (The fact Basehart played Adolf Hitler in a 1962 movie didn't hurt.) Thanks, Amazon, for making this program available for purchase.",1373500800,17,1001,4.661016949152542
4962021,5,B0066E6RWE,"This is one of the best documentaries about WW-II that I have ever seen.  I would highly recommend it.  I remembered this program from when it was on TV in the 1960s or 1970s.

The quality of the DVD is outstanding.  This is an old black and white presentation, but it was transfered to DVD with the video very sharp and the audio clear.

The first copy I received would not play correctly.  I returned it and reordered.  The second copy is perfect.",1349222400,11,449,4.337349397590361
4962022,5,B0066E6RWE,"My husband has this video in VHS, but I found that they had finally copied it into DVD.  He was surprised and loves the documentary.  The quality was better than the VHS.",1344124800,6,170,4.28125
4962032,4,B0066E6RWE,"I was hoping this movie would be more interesting, it was  a bit dull.  There many documentaries about Nazi Germany and Hitler.  I was hoping that this movie based on the book of the same name would offer some interesting insights that all the others had missed.  They had interviews with people who on the most part were never identified.  When Hitler speaks there are no subtitles and no narration about what he supposed to be saying.  It was a bit dissapointing.",1427932800,2,465,4.609756097560975
4962033,4,B0066E6RWE,"Although there are many documentaries about the third reich,this documentary ranks at the top with the best of them.

4962037,5,B0066E6RWE,"I saw this one as part of a high school history course, back in the days of VHS. After seeing it I read Shirer's book of the same title & was fascinated by it. Now, at last, that old mini-series has been released on DVD!

This is one of the definitive histories of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, which the madman himself predicted would 1,000 years. It fell 988 years short of that mark, and in those 12 years plunged both Germany - and the world - into a nightmare. That nightmare included brutal oppression of German citizens in the form of the Gestapo, SS, concentration camps, the so-called 'Nuremberg Laws' and other horrors, as well as forcing countries into the Reich - such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Austria - with tacit support from the UK and USSR, in the name of 'world peace'; and last but not least, plunging the world into 6 years of violent conflict known as World War 2.

The late William Shirer, author of the book, appears periodically throughout the mini-series. It begins by detailing the origins of the Nazi party & Hitler's early years, including his service in World War 1. His rise to power & gradual erosion of Germans' civil liberties is also highly detailed.

This is one of the best documentaries of the nightmare known as the Third Reich, along with the previously mentioned 'Chronicle of the Third Reich'. Highly recommended for amateur historians or those with a thorough grasp of the events of those times.",1407801600,,1440,4.683794466403162
4962038,3,B0066E6RWE,"As a WWII buff, and daughter of a WWII veteran, I have many recordings, movies and books on the subject from many angles. I also worked in Germany for several months in the early sixties, and heard first hand how many of the ordinary German citizens survived and eventually pulled themselves up by their bootstraps after the War. I had hoped this video would go into more depth on the thinking and decisions of the third Reich leaders as Hitler led the country into the horrors of that time.",1397779200,2,491,4.52808988764045
4962039,5,B0066E6RWE,I remember watching this with my father when it was broadcast on ABC in the spring of 1968. My father was a World War II veteran and I was all of ten years old. It helped me to understand the evil that was the 3rd Reich. This documentary holds up well. David Wolper did a fantastic job.,1392681600,2,286,4.035087719298246
4962040,5,B0066E6RWE,"THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH (1968) was the first-ever TV mini-series, running 6 hours over three consecutive nights. Shortened by a half, it exists now only as a theatrical release. Lost in the process are many interviews of partcipants, witnesses and victims of the 12 year horror that was Nazi Germany.

The book's author, William L. Shirer appears twice. Stock footage, particularly of Post-WWI Germany is of great interest. Excerpts of several Hitler speeches are seen and heard, but translations are few and subtitles non-existent. Clearly intentional, for this is no unbiased work. At times the outrage and seething hatred for Der Fuhrer is so obvious you can touch it. Narrative insults are employed (not that the bastid didn't deserve 'em!). In its present form,  ""Rise and Fall"" is a fast-moving story consisting  primarily of contemporary war and other footage.

A David L. Wolper production for MGM, directed by Jack Kaufman, written by Alan Landsburg. Film score: Lalo Schifrin (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible/dp/B000HWZ4HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission Impossible</a>"").",1392076800,3,1156,5.904191616766467
4962041,2,B0066E6RWE,"A question that we are asked to consider is wheather this particular film is worth viewing. I'am not certain if there is any real value that is derived from watching ""The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich"".This particular 3 Part presentation is more than merely judgemental it is so to such an extent that there is a lack of cognitive presence in the attempt to judge. A particular instance for example is when Adolf Hitler is preparing to take over Austria. The Former Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg  is interviewed. He remarks that Adolf Hitler broached the topic when in discussion with The Austrian Chancellor. The topic involved The Habsburg Monarchy. Historically The Habsburg Monarchy  from 1804-1867  was formally unified as the Austrian Empire and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The former Chancellor chided perhaps the viewer mostly whereby there was a rediculous idea that the history of the Chancellors own country was not relevant in his discussion with Adolf Hitler. The undisclosed information is that Adolf Hitler in ""Mein Kampf"" discusses at length Vienna,Austria(A City of Races)(A City with the magic of mediocrity).Adolf Hitler says much about the House of  Habsburg and about the Habsburg Monarchy. Austria was  at one time a weakened state to Germany with the Triparte Pact(that is Adolf Hitlers opinion expressed in Mein Kampf).There is so much information that is not provided that it was that that made me truthfully consider if in fact this was worth viewing. Perhaps it was not worth viewing. I do not know much of anything if the sum of that knowledge was to be provided merely by this particular viewing experience. There is just much to much information that is not present whereby we as a viewer are not an informed consideration. I do not want to do the work that was the responsibility of the film to provide. I wish perhaps to suggest that there are better informed presentations that would most certainly not be reserved in their desire to provide something more truthful. I feel this film is lacking in candor perhaps in a greater reservation it is not truthful.",1388188800,2,2122,4.949438202247191
8493861,5,B0066E6RWE,"The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich, a 1968 TV documentary narrated by actor Richard Basehart (who, oddly enough, portrayed the infamous dictator of the Reich in the 1962 film Hitler), is a compelling study of the life of one of the most brutal regimes of the 20th century.  It is accurate both for it's time and today. Any documentary involving the Nazis or Nazism worth its proverbial salt can only be brutal and Frank. The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich lives up to that standard and thus is not for the faint of heart. If you want some straight goods on one of the most nefarious times in human history, purchase a copy of The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich on DVD today... but ONLY if you have a stomach for brutal, unvarnished truth.",1527897600,,744,4.314285714285714

3 parts~ shows how the events surrounding World War 2 and how World War1~  influenced Hitler and the entire German People and Economy. Excellent and holds the interest. Narrated by Richard Basehart. Based on the book by William Shire a reporter and writer who lived in Germany and Europe to record first hand events. He is gives a close up look and view inside Nazi Germany and information and interviews of men who were actually part of the inner circle of Hitler. Very good.",1517616000,,538,4.652631578947369

8493864,5,B0066E6RWE,"Wow!  I didn't know that anyone gave much attention to this part of ww2 before the mid-1980s since most people did not want to talk about it.  I love having actual footage from period edit circa 1960s narrative telling the saga.  At that, the thoroughness of the whole story. I am a child of the 1980s, but a teacher and more-so a student of history. Considering the subject at hand, I hate to say I love the documentary, but I do.",1499299200,,431,4.296296296296297

8493870,3,B0066E6RWE,"Got this review mixed-up with ""Chronicle of the Third Reich"" which was made in the 1990's (but was still very dull, low-key narration.)  This is the 1968 ""old-timey"" narrative format.  Okay, but the music is meant to over-emphasize the content -- MENACING, ALARMING MUSIC SOUNDTRACK; as was common at the time of this production's original release.  Okay purchase!",1430352000,,364,5.241379310344827
