8283738,5,B0016GOMYC,"Surprisingly a very good movie.  A very good script, good flow, ok directing.  Music is pleasant, though would have eliminated a few songs!  It gets 5 stars for Bobby Deol's flawless performance. He fits his character so well and does his role justice.  By far one of his best performances to date.  The script has unexpected turns and twist, enjoyed it so much that had to purchase it.  It does not fall within the usual formula of an Indian movie, it had a unique plot.",1456358400,,471,4.482352941176471
