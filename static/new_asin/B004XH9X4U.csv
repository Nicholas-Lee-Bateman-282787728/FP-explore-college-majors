4495672,4,B004XH9X4U,"I waited a while forn this season to be released in Australia but to no avail, so I ordered it here. All episodes are uncut, have great guest stars and good plots. The quality on Affair Of The Heart drops occasionally, but that is because, I assume, the missing scenes have been added top make it complete. Sgt. Enright being upgraded to a Lieutenant means is only seen briefly throughout the series, which is a shame. Richard Gilliland is good and Martha Rae is no Nancy Walker, but she does her best. At any rate, we now have the entire six seasons to enjoy whenever we feel the need to return to the 70s.",1324684800,6,607,4.333333333333333
4495673,5,B004XH9X4U,"As a child, I remember how disappointed I was that Susan Saint James was not on the final season of McMillan. The onscreen chemistry of Hudson and St. James was what made the show. Now, since Rock Hudson has become a legend, I will buy this final season because it is a part of his works. I hope I will be better entertained watching this now then I did as a small child, when it was originally broadcast. Ironically, Sally and her son were killed in a plane crash. In real life, Susan St. James lost her son in a plane crash and nearly her husband. It is a sad case how irony from actor's t.v. or movie performances, reflect their own lives later. In memory of Rock Hudson, he was a true legend. Susan St. James, we love you.
Revised 11-11-12: I finally got this dvd set and was plesantly surprised. The stories were great and Rock actually acted better and had a sense of humor to his acting. Martha Raye does nicely as a replacement for Nancy Walker. I was afraid I wouldn't like her because I didn't like her guest appearence last season. Richard Gilliard makes a nice addition to the cast. In ten years, he will later play Mary Jo Snively's boyfriend on Designing Women and in real life marry Jean Smart. John Schuck has a limited role but I never liked him to begin with, so I didn't miss him. All the stories were great but my favorite was Phillip's Game. In this episode, Mac is confronted with a hit man, who tells him that he is going to kill him. Shirley Jones guest stars in this episode. I won't say this is better than the episodes with Susan St. James but it is just as good and deserves to be in your McMillan collection. Now, someone help me by placing the answer in the comment area. Which episode mentions Mac's son was killed with Sally in the plane crash. In the first episdoe I only heard John Schuck mentioned Sally was killed.",1311379200,18,1850,4.318965517241379
4495674,5,B004XH9X4U,"When ""McMillan & Wife"" ended at the end of season 5 in 1976 Susan Saint James and the show's producers got into some tough negotiations regarding money. Instead of giving her what she wanted the producers, along with NBC, decided to fire Saint James and write the character out by killing Sally and her child in a plane crash. So, the producers were stuck trying to pull a show together without one of its leads. The series became titled ""McMillan"" and lasted one paltry season and was cancelled due to terrible ratings. To make matters worse Nancy Walker, who was fantastic as Mildred, was replaced as McMillan's housekeeper by Martha Raye. The show simply lost its way or as they say in the television industry ""jumped the shark"".

 The following is a list of all 6 telefilms of ""McMillan"" (90 minutes in length)along with their airdates. There are also no bonus features.

4495678,3,B004XH9X4U,"How could Rock Hudson and the producers of McMillan and Wife simply write Wife off and set McMillan free to date a new woman in every episode, dump Mildred his wisecracking housekeeper and replace her with the amazingly annoying Martha Raye and expect viewers to be OK with that? I bought this season because I'm obsessive and wanted all of them but it is a pale imitation of the first 5 seasons. John Schuck has also been replaced with Richard Gilliand who is kind of funny but more dopey acting than anything else. Also, they didn't even use the same set! What is up with that? But the worst offense to me is that the season opened without any mention of Sally other than in passing. PLEASE! McMillan should have been a little sad for at least, oh, five minutes! Buy it if you are also compulsive, enjoy it but keep the wine handy. It helps.",1363651200,20,843,4.410256410256411
4495679,3,B004XH9X4U,"This shouldn't have been advertised McMillan & Wife because Sally was dead in the sixth season and there were only 6 episodes total on 3 discs. Sally was dead, and I didn't know this before I ordered. As far as I'm concerned, Sally and McMillan made the show together. Six episodes, for what I paid, wasn't worth it. It should have been a lot less. Also the show was o.k., but with Sally gone, it lost a lot for me.",1356134400,7,415,4.2

4495682,4,B004XH9X4U,"When Susan Saint James and Nancy Walker both did not return for the sixth season of McMillan and Wife, some massive retooling was required.  The show was renamed ""McMillan"", with Rock Hudson carrying on as San Francisco police commissioner Stuart ""Mac"" McMillan for six more episodes as part of NBC's Sunday Mystery Movie.  As the season opens, Mac has been a widower for about eight months, as his wife Sally (Saint James) has been killed in a plane crash.  His housekeeper Mildred (Walker) has moved back east, but has been replaced by her sister Agatha (Martha Raye) who had previously appeared in the series.

That's not the end of the changes, as McMillan's long time sidekick Charles Enright (John Schuck) has been promoted to lieutenant, and no longer works directly with the commissioner.  Mac's new right hand man is Sergeant Steve DiMaggio (Richard Gilliland), a semi-competent, kind of klutzy type who mainly provides an unnecessary comedic element.  Gloria Stroock returns as Mac's secretary Maggie.

Minus a spouse, and mostly on his own, Mac is the focus of attention, and assumes a more physically active role.  Fortunately Rock Hudson was up to the challenge.  The stories in the fifth season were very good, and the quality of the writing remains at a high level in the sixth and final season.  With Sally out of the picture, Mac is usually heavily involved with one of his luscious female costars, which include Jessica Walter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Play-Misty-for-Me/dp/B00005LC4R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Play Misty for Me</a>, Archer), Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family), Julie Sommars (Matlock), Joan Van Ark (Knots Landing), Stephanie Powers (The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.), and Karen Valentine (Room 222).  As always, the program features an impressive array of top draw guest stars, who will be very familiar to fans of this era of television.

For the 1976-77 season the Mystery Movie returned to a 90 minute length, with episodes running around 72 minutes.  One of the strongest stories is ""Dark Sunrise"" where Mac is on a fishing trip, when two people are killed in an explosion in his home.  Mac is presumed dead, and enlists the help of Officer Maureen Rupert (Karen Valentine) to help him discover who wants him dead.  Valentine is wonderful in this well-written and suspenseful tale that also features Julie Adams (The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creature-from-the-Black-Lagoon/dp/B007SZCZ2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>), and a young Kim Basinger (LA Confidential).

""Affair of the Heart"" is another great episode, which has kind of a Columbo type vibe, as early on it is appears that a clue to the killer's identity has been provided.  However as the investigation continues, it turns out that things are not exactly as they might seem.  Larry Hagman, who was just about to assume the role of J.R. Ewing on Dallas, guests as Mac's dentist, while Stephanie Powers plays an assistant DA.

In ""Coffee, Tea, or Cyanide?"", Mac is on a plane bound for a vacation in Hawaii, when a man mysteriously dies of cyanide poisoning, and another man is found murdered.  The plane returns to San Francisco, where Mac continues the investigation.  Guest stars include Ed Nelson, Julie Sommars, Russell Johnson (Gilligan's Island), and Trisha Sterling (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coogan-s-Bluff/dp/B0001FVDJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coogan's Bluff</a>).

The series finishes on a high note with the sleight of hand of ""Have You Heard About Vanessa?""  With a little homicidal encouragement, top model Vanessa Vale (JoAnna Cameron) has fallen to her death from her high rise apartment.  Joan Van Ark guests as a photographer concerned about the loss of one of her best models.

Stuart McMillan is surrounded by a bevy of beautiful women, but has no lasting attachments to anyone.  There's a little romance, but nothing too heavy.  The writers appear to go easy on Mac, and avoid making one of his lady friends a traitor or murderer.  Sally's presence is definitely missed, but with Mac a bit over-burdened, there's not much time for love.

Martha Raye is terrific as Agatha, who keeps pushing for Mac to find a wife, and is a solid replacement for Mildred.  While the addition of Raye is a plus, replacing Charles Enright with Sergeant DiMaggio, is pretty much a failure.  Speaking of disasters, around the same time, John Schuck was also starring as a robot in the ABC series Holmes and Yoyo, which was created by Leonard Stern, the executive producer of McMillan.  The short lived Holmes and Yoyo, has come to be regarded as one of the worst TV series of the 1970's.

Fans of McMillan and Wife will note that although similar, McMillan obviously lacks romantic playfulness, and just doesn't play quite the same.  Still, McMillan is very well written, and the stories are engaging and entertaining.  Rock Hudson is put to the test, and he comes through with flying colors.  After the 1977 season the NBC Mystery Movie (1971-77) came to an end, closing the book on a notable period in television, as Columbo (45 episodes), McCloud (46 episodes), and McMillan and Wife/McMillan(40 episodes), each part of the original lineup, all managed to complete the entire run.",1338336000,23,5351,5.343675417661098
