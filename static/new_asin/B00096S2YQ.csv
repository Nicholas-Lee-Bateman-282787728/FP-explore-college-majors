2268161,5,B00096S2YQ,Always adore Brian Dennehy especially in the Jack Reed movies.......wish there were more to view.  First saw the one called Deadly Matrimony and fascinated with his acting.  Do wish it would come out in DVD.,1371686400,,207,4.885714285714286
2268162,4,B00096S2YQ,"I love the Jack Reed series. Reed (played by Brian Dennehy) is a unique character, a tough cop with Jesuit training. The Chicago setting, complete with many levels of corruption and political connections, offers many plot possibilities that are explored in this series.

Reed is not corruptible, but is surrounded by corruption. As a result, he can't get promoted and has to take odd jobs to support his family. He has a wry sense of humor, a keen wit, is compassionate and intelligent. Although surrounded by corruption and chaos, he always seems to find a way to see that justice is done, one way or another.

I have the four movies that are available on DVD for this series. One that doesn't seem to be available is ""Jack Reed: A Killer Among Us.""

I first saw the Jack Reed character on TV (these are all made-for-TV movies) and that got me into collecting as many of them as I could get. I wish they had made more, but I think there were only five made.

This particular episode has a strong cast with the talented Miguel Ferrer as the bad guy and an expanded role for Susan Ruttan, who plays Reed's wife in the series. Charles S. Dutton is also a regular in the series.",1367798400,5,1175,4.4511627906976745

2268164,2,B00096S2YQ,"This dvd has no scene menu. When player returns to the beginning of the dvd after a lengthy pause, navigating to find your place is worse than old vhs tapes with no counters.",1316476800,,174,4.303030303030303
2268165,5,B00096S2YQ,"I saw these movies when they aired on network television.  I haven't seen them since, but have always remembered them favorably.  I found them on Amazon and decided to buy them.  I am not disappointed.  The only way they could be better is if they were in Blu-ray, but they weren't popular enough to go that route.  Brian Dennehy has always been one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint.  He also produced these three movies.  Good storytelling.",1314921600,2,457,4.6375

2268167,3,B00096S2YQ,"An unsettled blend of action with drama marks this movie, the third endeavour by Brian Dennehy performing as Sergeant Jack Reed, a veteran Cook County (Chicago) Sheriff's Department homicide detective, with Dennehy additionally making his first directing stint while being credited as well for having written part of the screenplay, all in the service of a work that will frustrate a viewer who is biased toward intelligent cinema due to its ongoing lapses into hackneyed episodes, in spite of some moments of notably insightful as well as naturalistic dialogue.  The first Jack Reed feature, DEADLY MATRIMONY, establishes the character as a Sheriff's Department freethinker who, in that picture, singlehandedly brings about the downfall, due to corruptness, of a high-ranking Department official, and in A SEARCH FOR JUSTICE, Reed discovers to his keen displeasure that he has been blocked from promotion to the rank of Lieutenant as a result of his honesty (considered as disloyalty by his peers), with his Detective partner being advanced over him because of ""race norming"", but the two nonetheless work effectively together as they attempt to solve a homicide, the victim a pregnant stripper (Marjorie Monaghan) whose day-time job is as a successful, albeit rather unbelievable, day care center operator, based at her trailer park home.  In his initial directoral outing, Dennehy provides an able effort, in the face of a script that is heavily laden with clich&eacute;, not an unusual condition for a film produced expressly for television.  Miguel Ferrer utilizes his lines to capably create his role of a man who desires more from life than he is likely to ever obtain from his comfortably established business and domestic relationships.  A more inventive and less bromidic scenario, one that would have included a realistic approach to law enforcement procedures, would have been needed to lift this piece a notch.",1199577600,5,1923,5.295081967213115
