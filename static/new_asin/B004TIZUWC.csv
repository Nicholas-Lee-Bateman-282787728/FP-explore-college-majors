So much more could have been done to keep the character's interesting. It was a very boring film with no real direction,jumping from here to there with no sense at all. And the end of the film was just horrible as if they got tired of making it and ran out of ideas. It was really a poor film for such a great film character.",1322265600,3,460,3.904255319148936
8440723,1,B004TIZUWC,"As a long-time fan of the Zatoichi films (I have the entire series at home), I was excited to hear that a new film was being made. As a die-hard traditionalist, and avid fan of the work os Shintaro Katsu, I was slightly concerned that the new Zatoichi would be portrayed by a much younger actor, a path adroitly avoided by Takeshi Kitano in his excellent outing ""The Blind Swordsman Zatoichi"", however, I felt it necessary to approach the new film with an open mind. However, after sitting through this film, I can only say how disappointed & disgusted I was at the treatment meted out to this iconic screen hero, by an actor (Shingo Katori) totally out of his depth here, and a director (Junji Sakamoto) possibly more suited to making television commercials. Simply put, ""The Last Zatoichi"" is appalling! Katori's hapless performance under Sakamoto's dreadful directing, presents Zatoichi as a weak & pathetic young man, directionless in his life, stumbling from one embarassing sword fight to another. And don't expect too much from the storyline or other characters in the film either. The story meanders all over the place in a very dis-jointed fashion, & after a while, you can't remember who among the supporting characters are good & who are bad. And all Zatoichi fans should feel insulted by the treatement given to his character in this piece of cinematic rubbish, and I can only imagine that his creator, as well as the the late Shintaro Katsu, must be turning in their graves. Clearly, Sakamoto overlooked the fact that in the world of the poor of that time, Zatoichi was their great hope; the blind, nomadic samurai, whose courage was legendary, & whose sword cut down all who oppressed the poor. These facts were not overlooked by Kitano in his film, which stayed true to the character of Zatoichi, and which, as a result, was widely accepted by Zatoichi & Katsu fans alike. The final insult for viewers & Zatoich fans alike, comes with the film's final outcome, and shows only too clearly, how far from the legendary status of the iconic Zatoichi, Sakamoto was prepared to stray, & how deep, & he was prepared to sink. If you are a Zatoichi fan, avoid this as you would the plague, after all, the character here is nothing like the real Zatoichi.",1315180800,5,2260,4.738578680203045
8440724,1,B004TIZUWC,"I have been waiting to see this film for over year. I was ecstatic when I saw it for sale here, but all the hype and anticipation over this film's release was ultimately sabotaged by the horrible attempt of english subtitling. I am a huge fan of japanese films and I have never seen subtitiling this bad before; not in any foreign film for that matter. If I had known that this was not the ""official"" release, I never would have purchased it. I'm sure that the real guardians of the rights to this film did not ok this transfer, and would probably be embarrassed and outraged to know of it's exsistence.",1313539200,,603,4.392857142857143
8440725,1,B004TIZUWC,"I ordered this DVD release of Zatoichi: The Last as soon as I saw it listed. I have been looking
forward to seeing this movie for a year. I sat down with a friend of mine to watch it and realized that the subtitling was either homemade or not properly edited. If you rely on the English subtitling, you can't follow the dialogue or the plot of the movie!  Many of the phrases don't make any sense. The picture is nice, the sets and acting are good, but I was very disappointed when I tried to follow the plot. You can't watch a movie that is over two hours long not being able to follow what is going on. So, I suggest that you wait and see if an ""official"" DVD release will be available in the future.",1308441600,6,702,4.086956521739131
