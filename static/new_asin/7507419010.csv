8472941,5,7507419010,"While exploring music on YouTube, I happened upon a video of Paul Carrack's playing live. I had remembered him from a former band back in the 80's by the name of Squeeze. I really enjoyed the video clips I watched online and decided to purchase the DVD from Amazon. Once I received  the DVD, I put it in my player and waited with anticipation for a great concert. Well, that's when I realized that it was in PAL format! Something I had overlooked in the rush to own it. NTSC is what we use in America and Europe uses PAL. I was devastated! Not to worry though! Many newer DVD players can accommodate multiple formats. I was able to watch, enjoy, and appreciate a great vocalist and musician along with his awesome band on another unit I had! I would highly recommend this DVD because of the quality of production. As a collector of audio and music video's, this is another gem of a find! Enjoy!",1371945600,3,894,4.385542168674699
