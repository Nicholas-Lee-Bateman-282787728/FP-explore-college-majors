4834369,5,B005M9VSKU,"I just watched this set after getting it for christmas and i gotta say it was really entertaining,the only real complaints i have is booker t hosting the set and bringing back the king booker gimmick i just muted the tv during his segments and there were a few matches missing that shouldve made the set like hart vs diesel KOTR 94 its a lost classic or austin vs kane from 98 i think it wouldve been cool to have had some of the older KOTR matches pre ppv like when hart won in 91. Over all its a great set o and the mcmahon vs angle street fight is as jaw dropping as the hell in a cell with taker and mankind.",1324857600,,612,3.983739837398374

Disc 1

King of the Ring Finals Match
Bret `Hit Man' Hart vs. Bam Bam Bigelow
King of the Ring 13th June, 1993 - A great match. I actually liked this more than the encounter released on the Bret Hart dvd which I think too place in Spain.

WWE Championship Match
Hulk Hogan vs. Yokozuna
King of the Ring 13th June, 1993 - Not the greatest from either man.

King of the Ring Finals Match
Owen Hart vs. Razor Ramon
King of the Ring 19th June, 1994 - Great match. This was the continuation of Owen's push. 1994 was definitely The Year Of The Rocket Turned King Of Harts, Owen Hart.

Kiss My Foot Match
Bret `Hit Man' Hart vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler
King of the Ring 25th June, 1995 - I enjoyed this match. Especially the ending. Let's just say Lawler got what he deserved lol.

Intercontinental Championship Match
Goldust vs. Ahmed Johnson
King of the Ring 23rd June, 1996 - This was my favorite era of Goldust so I'm glad it's here.

King of the Ring Finals Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts
King of the Ring 23rd June, 1996 - SCSA's rise to the top began here.

WWE Championship Match
Shawn Michaels vs. British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith
King of the Ring 23rd June, 1996 - Their best encounter together.

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels
King of the Ring 8th June, 1997 - As good as their WM14 match was, this is an often forgotten classic that served as a prelude to what we'd expect at WM14

King of the Ring Finals Match
Triple H vs. Mankind
King of the Ring 8th June, 1997 - I liked this match. But they have had better ones.

King of the Ring Finals Match
Ken Shamrock vs. The Rock
King of the Ring 28th June, 1998 - Great match from both men. These two always have great matches together.

Hell in a Cell Match
Undertaker vs. Mankind
King of the Ring 28th June, 1998 - DESERVES TO BE HERE WITHOUT QUESTION.

WWE Championship Match
Undertaker vs. The Rock
King of the Ring 27th June, 1999 - I enjoy almost any Undertaker match I see. No exception here.

6 Man Tag Match for the WWE Championship
Triple H, Mr. McMahon & Shane McMahon vs. The Rock, Undertaker & Kane
King of the Ring 25th June, 2000 - This was the first time I ever saw this kind of match. The buildup was great & the match loved up to any hype it received. A rare & never mentioned bout. The second time this tupe of match happend was at Backlash 2009 when HHH/Batista/Shane fought Legacy (Orton/Rhodes/Dibiase)

King of the Ring Finals Match
Rikishi vs. Kurt Angle
King of the Ring 25th June, 2000 - Didn't really like it. But here, Kurt became KOTR so.....

Light Heavyweight Championship Match
Jeff Hardy vs. X-Pac
King of the Ring 24th June, 2001 - I liked both guys. But I don't know if I liked this or not. I don't know why, really. Maybe the X-Pac Sucks chants were getting to me.

King of the Ring Finals Match
Edge vs. Kurt Angle
King of the Ring 24th June, 2001 - Great match!

Street Fight
Shane McMahon vs. Kurt Angle
King of the Ring 24th June, 2001 - A match you have to see again like Taker/Makind HIAC.

King of the Ring Finals Match
Rob Van Dam vs. Brock Lesnar
King of the Ring 23rd June, 2002 - The beginning of a push that turned out to be a mistake because of the way he left the company that made him the household name he is today.

Hulk Hogan vs. Kurt Angle
King of the Ring 23rd June, 2002 - I respect & am fans of both men. For Hogan's age, he did pretty well here.

King of the Ring Finals Match
Bobby Lashley vs. Booker T
Judgment Day 21st May, 2006 - I didn't really like Lashley all that much. THat's probably why I didn't enjoy this that match.

King of the Ring Finals Match
CM Punk vs. William Regal
Monday Night Raw 21st April, 2008 - Regal won the KOTR. But after that, his career really didn't go anywhere.

King of the Ring Finals Match
John Morrison vs. Sheamus
Monday Night Raw 29th November, 2010 - These two had a great series. IMO, this great match is topped only by their match at TLC.

Blu-ray Exclusives

King of the Ring Semi-Finals Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Wildman Marc Mero
King of the Ring 23rd June, 1996 - I enjoyed this one very much.

WWE Championship Match
Triple H vs. Undertaker
King of the Ring 23rd June, 2002 - Not their greatest match. But till the finish, I liked it.

King of the Ring Opening Round Match
Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton
SmackDown 14th April, 2006 - I wasn't watching SD during this time so can't comment as I didn't see it.

King of the Ring Semi-Finals Match
CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho
Monday Night Raw 21st April, 2008 - Loved it. Perhaps these two will have a program worthy of culminating at a WM. Maybe WM28 or another.

King of the Ring Quarter-Finals Match
Alberto Del Rio vs. Daniel Bryan
Monday Night Raw 29th November, 2010 - Probably because of Daniel Bryan's skill & Del Rio's potential, I expected a little more. But this was still enjoyable.

Overall it's decent enough. But hopefully they'll release a complete anthology. Stuff from pre-93 is missing as well as:
Bret vs Razor and Bret vs Perfect from 93, Owen vs Tatanka from 94, SCSA vs Kane from 98 (probably too graphic from WWE's current PG rating. If that's not the reason, then it should've been included), the tag team match from 99 between Edge/Christian & Hardyz, KOTR 2001 final between Edge and don't remember who fought him (Was it Rhyno??) and Taker/Mankind from 96 which is an all out brawl that I enjoyed so much that I wish the match was a bit longer though the actual length was just fine as their bodies went through enough hell as it is. I'm sure others I didn't mention are missing too which deserve to be here. That's why a complete anthology needs to be released....so nothing's missing. For now though, this is all we get.

Maybe if sales for this were good, a complete set will be released soon??",1323907200,,5826,4.322314049586777
4834371,5,B005M9VSKU,"I just watch the Owen-Razor match and I am disappointed that they cut the video short of crowning Owen as King of the Ring but I am very glad to see Owen again, I miss that guy! Rest in Peace Owen!",1323734400,,197,3.8292682926829267
4834372,5,B005M9VSKU,"When I heard that the WWE was going to release this set I was so happy.  At one time the King of the Ring was one of my favorite events and this set should be really good.  One of the things, first off, that I noticed is that a lot of these matches have not been released before or maybe have been released once which is a good thing.  I love the fact that we will get to see the finals of the very first KOTR with Bret Hart vs Bam Bam Bieglow.  Honestly, this is a pretty good match and the fact that Bret wins makes it so much better.  The other match you get from 1993 is the Hogan vs Yokozuna match for the World title.  I kinda wish they would not have shown this one.  It's an ok match but the ending is just awful.  If you've never seen this match just wait and see what I'm talking about.  From 1994, we get the finals again when Owen Hart beats Razor Ramon to win the KOTR.  This is a great match and a good representative from th 94 event.  I only wish they would have included the World title match between Bret and IC champ Diesel.  These 2 always had great matches and this is one of my favorites between the two.  The 95 edition of the KOTR was probably the worst one of all the events as Mabel wins the thing!  The match they chose to represent the event was the Kiss My Foot match between Bret Hart and Jerry Lawler.  This feud was a good feud but you know i really never thought these two worked that well in the ring and this is just another example of that as this match isn't that good.  I kind of wanted to see Shawn Michaels vs Kama that went to a 15 min time limit draw in the first round of the KOTR tournament.  The 1996 edition features a few matches from it.  The first one is the IC title match between Goldust and Ahmed Johnson.  This was a good match with a lot of really good mind games being played by Goldust.  It is a little suprising that they chose this one but it is good.  Of course, we get the finals with Jake Roberts and Steve Austin.  The match itself sucks but hopefully they'll keep the interview with Steve afterwards as this is what truly made him in the WWE.  We also get the world title match between Shawn Michaels and the British Bulldog.  This is a killer match and well worth the price of the DVD set alone.  These two guys always put on a great show and this one is just as good as the rest.  On the Blu Ray edition u also get Steve Austin's first match of the night against Marc Mero which is actually a good match.  We get 2 representatives from the 1997 edition.  The first is the match with Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels.  This is a pretty good match even though both Shawn and Steve have slammed the match in the past.  I actually like this match and as a note check out the kid who tries to jump into the ring to save Shawn near the beginning of the match.  The other match you get is the KOTR finals between Triple H and Mankind.  I thought this was also a good match to add to the set.  From the 1998 edition we also get 2 entries.  The first is the finals between Ken Shamrock and the Rock.  Honestly, these 2 guys never really had a good match but this one was very very good.  I remember watching this one when I was a teenager and being on the edge of my seat.  This is a good one.  The other one is one that we have seen so many times I think the WWE could have done without it and that is the Hell in the Cell match with Undertaker and Mankind.  Is it a great match ?  Yes it is.  Is it worth another spot on a DVD ?  No I don't think it is.  I mean it's been on a Taker set, Mick Foley's set, the Hell in a Cell set and just recently on the OMG set.  I'm not a hater of the match I just think it's been released too much and is now overkill.  The 1999 edition has one match and that's the world title match between the Rock and the Undertaker.  It's an ok match but nothing really killer in it.  I actually would have liked to have seen the KOTR finals with X-Pac and Billy Gunn going on it.  That was a really good match that I would have liked to have seen on the show.  We get 2 entries from the 2000 event.  The first is the finals of the KOTR with Kurt Angle and Rikishi going at it.  This is a pretty good match but is it worth being on the DVD ?  Probably not.  The second is the World title/6 man tag match with champion Triple H teaming with Vince and Shane McMahon vs Undertaker, Kane and Rock.  The stipulations for this match was basically whoever scored the pinfall got the win and the title (Triple H did not have to be involved in the decison to lose the title).  This was a good match with a sick spot from Shane in it.  The 2001 edition has 3 entries.  The first is the Light Heavyweight title match between Jeff Hardy and X-Pac.  It's a good match but not great.  Not sure why this one is on here.  The next one is the finals of the KOTR with Kurt Angle and Edge.  I love this match as it has a lot of action in it and we got Kurt trying to go for his 2nd straight KOTR.  Great match.  The other one we get is the street fight between Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon.  This match is just freaking sick from start to finish.  This is actually one of the best street fights I have seen and thought it maybe should have won Match of the Year in 2001.  The 2002 edition was the last one to be on PPV and has 2 entries.  The first one is the KOTR finals with Brock Lesnar and RVD.  I like this match even though I knew who was going to win.  As a side note I am glad that WWE is starting to put Brock in some of their DVD sets as it seems like he was shunned there for a while.  The other match is a killer one with Kurt Angle vs Hulk Hogan.  This is actually one of Hogan's best matches in the WWE and that is due in no small part to Kurt and his ability to make just about anyone look good.  If you get the Blu Ray edition you also get the World title match with Triple H vs Undertaker.  Do not expect a WM 17 or a WM 27 from these two in this one.  I remember buying the PPV when this came out in 2002 and I actually fell asleep during the match.  It isn't that good.  After 2002, the KOTR went on a sabbatical and made its return in 2006 where it was mainly done on TV.  We do get one match from 2006 and that is the finals between Booker T and Bobby Lashly.  This match did take place at Judgement Day and it was a pretty good match.  I was happy that Booker won and added another honor to his unbelievable career.  Next we go to 2008 as there was no KOTR in 2007.  We get another match that is the finals from 2008.  The match is CM Punk vs William Regal and it is a really good contest.  I can remember watching this one and just hoping that Punk would win but that was not to be.  Still this is a good one.  The Blu Ray edition will include the semi final match between CM Punk and Chris Jericho which is also a very good match.  After 2008 we again skip a year and the KOTR makes a return in 2010.  We get one match from that one and it is also the finals with Sheamus taking on John Morrison in a thriller of a match.  I actually thought this was going to be Morrison's match but they went with the Celtic Warrior instead.  And again if u get the Blu Ray you also get Alberto del Rio vs Daniel Bryan in a quarter final match that was pretty good.

So, all in all I think the WWE has done an outstanding job with the match selection here.  Some of these matches I have never seen on a DVD release or have not seen in quite some time and look forward to seeing them again.  I really can't wait for this one to be released.  I say good job on this one WWE!!",1321488000,3,7544,3.9220607661822986
4834373,3,B005M9VSKU,"If you're a true WWE fan then you would know King of the Ring didn't start in 1993 but was rather a one night tournament back on house shows back in the late 80's up until 91. They even had the gimmick on tv back in the 80's as Harley Race, Jim Duggan, Haku, and Randy Savage all held the crown. This was the 80's and WWF had the talent to spare plus they had good storylines that made sense. Anyways, King of The Ring was always one of my favorite WWF PPV's. Granted, 1995  King of the Ring was one of the worst PPV's of all time. There is too many repeats on this set that could have been avoided, but Mankind-Undertaker Hell in the Cell and Angle-McMahon Street Fight are two of the best matches you'll ever see so I understand putting that on another disc. However, King of The Ring 1994 had one of the greatest 3 minute matches you'll ever witness, Owen Hart VS 1-2-3 Kid. If you've never watched it, go out and do so. The opening contest of that PPV, Ramon vs Bigelow, was pretty damn good as well. The Diesel VS Bret Hart match on the same PPV was pretty great as well. All in all, i'm a fan of the WWF I grew up on. The 90's may have not been the cool time to watch WWF but alot of those matches and storylines beats out anything the WWE is putting out today. I wish they focused more on earlier King of The Rings rather then random matches on the PPV. I think they should have just put out the entire King of The Ring PPV set rather then this decent but could have been so much better set.",1320451200,7,1498,4.043771043771044

I'm guessing because those reigns weren't part of the KotR ppv, but what about King Mabel? They could've at least added a match from one of the previous kings. I may be in the minority here but I'd much rather see a King Harley match or a Macho King match than Goldust vs Ahmed Johnson. Or how about leaving off the Taker and Mankind hiac match. Not that it's not a good match but any mark buying this probably already has it on a previous release. This is typical of today's WWE ignoring the past and shoving more Stone Cold, the Rock and the Undertaker down our throats. Those guys were all great but they didn't invent the business and I could really do without another DVD full of the overrated ""attitude"" era. What was once a great idea for adding to a heel character to a fun to watch ppv to a meaningless tv tournament makes this just an okay release.",1334620800,2,998,4.257894736842105
4834433,4,B005M9VSKU,"Before concepts like Money In The Bank existed, there was another event where a superstar on the roster could be elevated to the next level & become a breakout ""man to pay attention to"" star in one night...the same concept that helped the career of some who would go on to become a WWE/World Champion & enter Hall Of Fame.  This concept is called King Of The Ring & this DVD, hosted by King Booker (not Booker T...KING BOOKER complete with accent) takes a look back at the best moments of not only the tournament but the original PPV itself that was around for a decade.

Bret Hart vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - This was the finals of the first King Of The Ring tournament (technically the first one on PPV) with Bret coming into the match wrestling one more match than Bigelow throughout the night causing Bret to have injured fingers & leg & back coming into the match.  Bigelow just kept overpowering Bret including tossing him over the top rope to the floor early in the bout before targeting his back with hard irish whips into the post, various blows including headbutts, backbreakers & bearhugs, bodyslam on the floor, using anything he could get his hand on such as the ringpost & even outside help.  Bret just refused to quit & kept fighting including being able to escape some holds while counter others with moves like the sleeper & a top rope bulldog.  Bigelow was too strong when Bret attempted the sharpshooter causing Bret to find an alternative route.  This wasn't a classic back & forth contest (look for his match against Mr. Perfect earlier in the night for that) but definitely told the story of Bret being the underdog fighting the giant who had everything going in his favor.  Keep watching as Bret had his ceremony only to be ""crowned"" by another King.

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Yokozuna - After that ending to WrestleMania IX, this was the rematch. If this wasn't Hogan's last WWE match for almost a decade, it wouldn't have been very memorable as the match never seemed to move out of first gear & was the stereotypical Hogan performance of being dominated before ""Hulking Up"" & making his comeback in the end but I'll give Hogan credit in the fact that he heavily sold for Yokozuna just based on his facial expressions throughout the match & the fact that he didn't slam Yokozuna. The ending was crap but in the end, Yokozuna regained the WWF Title & Hulk Hogan left the WWE to not be seen again for almost a decade.

[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

Razor Ramon vs. Owen Hart - Unlike the finals the previous year, both men had wrestled two previous matches earlier in the night to get here. Owen showed he was wasn't intimidated by Razor by slapping him right away causing Razor to respond by showing his heavy power advantage with various slams & side headlock takeovers before Owen caught Razor with his own spinning heel kick & abdominal stretch.  Razor went for the Razor's Edge at one point only for Owen to counter with a backdrop that sent Razor over the top rope to the floor when someone who already made an impact in the WWE Championship match earlier in night came out to once again be an impact player leading to the birth of ""The King Of Harts.""
King Of The Ring '94

Kiss My Foot Match: Bret Hart vs. Jerry Lawler - This was the rematch from the previous month's ""In Your House"" with the special stipulation that the loser must kiss the foot of the winner resulting in Lawler making sure his foot had an absolutely horrible smell so Bret would have the worst experience possible if he lost. Bret was real aggressive from the start that came back to bite him giving Lawler control for a few moments before Bret got back control. Hakushi an appearance leading to Bret getting his revenge and for Lawler, that wasn't the only thing that didn't taste good.

WWE Intercontinental Champion Goldust vs. Ahmed Johnson - The DVD I rented had a bad scratch here so I wasn't able to see this match clearly to comment on it.
King Of The Ring '96

Jake Roberts vs. Steve Austin - This was the final match of the annual King Of The Ring tournament with Jake going into the match with ribs that were heavily injured by Vader earlier in the night while Austin's lip was patched up from being busted open earlier in the night. Austin was completely ruthless here & the perfect heel against Jake who refused to quit despite the referee & even President Gorilla Monsoon coming out to check up on him as Jake was after his own ""Cinderella"" story as Austin kept focusing on Jake's ribs.  When all was said & done, Austin 3:16 was born.

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. British Bulldog - It should be noted that Mr. Perfect was assigned to be the special outside referee due to the controversial ending to their previous PPV match, Owen Hart was on commentary for this match, and Bulldog was not only managed by Jim Cornette during this match but also had his wife, who was accusing Shawn of sexual harassment during this time, in his corner as well.  Bulldog showed off his power advantage early by shoving Shawn to the floor twice resorting in Shawn going for the strategy of grounding Bulldog while also using his lucha influenced offense like catching Bulldog in a head scissors sending him to the floor followed by a frankensteiner off the apron.  Bulldog decided to also try to ground Shawn but kept getting outpaced by Shawn & eventually got caught in a armbar takedown.  Bulldog's strength came to his advantage with moves like pressing Shawn over the top to the floor only to press him back into the ring before going back to grounding him in the ring.  Shawn kept trying to fight out of it with various move attempts only for Bulldog to have counters of his own such an attempted frankensteiner into a powerbomb.  This was one of the best quality singles performances in Bulldog's career during this period while Shawn was really on his game during this period as well resulting in a quality encounter.

[Shawn Michaels: Heartbreak & Triumph]

Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels - This match was one of the most unusual in WWE history at this time based off the setup alone as both men were Tag Team Champions who didn't get along but had a common enemy in the Hart Foundation who were instrumental in both men having this match in the first place.  Despite both men having different personalities, Austin being no-frills while Shawn was the flashy type, each one didn't have a problem showing their rebellious personality early as they both knocked the other down & gave them the middle finger early in the match before it got more competitive as time went with both men trading momentum back & forth to the point where a cameraman got knocked off the ring.  Just like how I stated that each man had a common rebellious attitude, that would heavily come into play in the end when both men were not happy with the referees officiating leading to both men seeing eye to eye despite still not trusting each other.

[The Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]

Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Years before both men started feuding over the WWE Championship in various matches from a street fight to a steel cage to Hell In A Cell, they met here in the finals of the 1997 tournament.  Mankind came into this match with a bad neck from his earlier encounter & Hunter showed early signs of his ""cerebral assassin"" persona by targeting that neck & working it over heavily including throwing Foley into the ropes so hard that his head was wrapped around & hung in the ropes in the same manner that caused him to lose his ear years earlier.  Hunter continued to beat on his neck with slamming it into the steps & various kneedrops to the head before Mankind was able to get some offense like dropping his elbow from the apron onto Hunter who was on the concrete floor.  Chyna did play a factor as the match went on throughout the match with Hunter continuing to beat on Mankind's neck while dishing more punishment like a pedigree through a table.  This match did it's job in that we saw Mankind bring out a more aggressive & calculated side of Hunter that we hadn't seen previously but he would be heavily known for years later as ""The Game.""

[Triple H: King Of Kings]

Ken Shamrock vs. The Rock - Triple H was on commentary (while Chyna did spanish commentary) for this match & this was during his babyface D-Generation X run so you had your share of funny one line comments & insults.  Both of these men had been feuding against each other all year so they knew each other very well with Shamrock kept tossing Rock to the outside resorting to him using dirty tactics to get an advantage before tossing him outside with his wrist getting caught in the ring ropes.  Rock continued to take advantage with dropping Shamrock on the guardrail & re-injuring his ankle while getting in Triple H's face at one point.  Both men showed signs of exhaustion & trading momentum throughout the rest of the match.  This was possibly their best televised matched from their feud that year.
King Of The Ring '98

Hell In A Cell Match: Undertaker vs. Mankind - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.

WWE Champion Undertaker vs. The Rock - In the first minute, two referees were knocked out while Rock hit the Rock Bottom & had Taker beat. They brawled from the ring to ringside to the entrance way & through the crowd using anything in sight like the ring bell, chairs, ether (you read that right) and even Paul Bearer getting a shot in with his shoe. This was definitely one of the most unusual & out of control matches in both men's careers.
King Of The Ring '99
[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

WWE Champion Triple H, Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon vs. The Rock, Undertaker, Kane - This was one of the most unusual WWE Championship matches in history just based off the setup alone as it was the first time the title was on the line in a six man tag as Triple H would lose the title if anyone on his team lost the fall while none of the members of the opposing team were getting along because they all wanted to win the championship.  The match started out with Shane vs. Kane with Kane putting his hands behind his back letting Shane get the first punch in which did even budge Kane before he got his hands on Shane & military pressed him with Taker later coming into the match beating up on Shane while narrating as he did it before Triple H's team would regain momentum with him doing most of the work with Shane attempting to help while Vince came in to get his shots in whenever the other guy was already down.  The issues between the challengers was clearly shown as The Rock would make blind tags into the ring twice, everyone breaking up each others pin attempts to the point where they started fighting each other with Kane chokeslamming everyone & Taker delivering a chairshot to the head before giving Shane McMahon one the biggest chokeslams you've ever seen.  This was a fun & entertaining match.
King Of The Ring '00

Rikishi vs. Kurt Angle - Rikishi came into this match with a bad arm from his earlier tournament matches but still brought the fight to Angle early before Kurt had to do whatever he could to block the stinkface early before going to work on that arm to the point where Rikishi couldn't use the arm & hurt himself when he tried to do a clothesline later in the match.  Rikishi attempted to use his weight to his advantage with splashes in the corner & dropping on top of Kurt during a sunset flip attempt but Angle would be denied including delivering his Olympic Slam & a belly to belly off the top rope.  This was one of those matches that was pretty short & sweet but told a story in the time they had.
King Of The Ring '00

WWE Light Heavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy vs. X-Pac - Various times during the ""Attitude Era"", WWE attempted to compete with WCW's crusierweight division with their own Light Heavyweight division but it just never really came together as it was suppose to but this was one of the rare title defenses of that title.  As expected when it comes to this division, the match was very fast paced with Hardy relying on his daredevil style with moves & moments like doing a clothesline off the guardrail, crashing & burning when attempting a Whisper In The Wind, and a Swanton while Pac resorted to more wrestling like working over the ribs & back with the abdominal stretch & hip tossing Hardy over the top rope before going aerial himself with a crossbody off the top rope.  Good encounter between both men.
King Of The Ring '01

Edge vs. Kurt Angle - Kurt was out to be the first man to ever repeat as King Of The Ring but was already scheduled for a Street Fight against Shane McMahon later that night so he tried to talk Edge into forfeiting the match but ended up insulting him in the process which caused Edge to reject Kurt's offer & start the match throwing punches.  Edge came into this match with hurt ribs from his earlier match which Kurt targeted by suplexing Edge over the top rope, throwing him into the steps, dropping him on the guardrail, and a back suplex before Edge made a comeback attempt including a frankensteiner off the top rope followed by various pin attempts.  This was another match that did it's job in establishing the King Of The Ring while pushing current (the upcoming Street Fight) & future (Edge & Christian) storylines.
King Of The Ring '01

Street Fight Match: Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon - You knew this was going to be one hell of a fight from the minute Kurt came out as he threw his medals down & charged to the ring to take down Shane with various takedowns & suplex in the opening minute.  This match was one of the matches of the year as these two delivered such an amazing performance that it ended up injuring both men for at least a month afterwards such as Shane McMahon being constantly thrown into the glass stage walls that had no give resulting in him landing on his head. This had something for everyone's taste... brawling, weapons, high impact moves, storytelling and even some amateur wrestling. I consider this a lost classic.

[OMG: Top 50 Incidents]

Rob Van Dam vs. Brock Lesnar - This King Of The Ring tournament final was different than the previous years events as the winner would also receive a WWE Championship match at SummerSlam.  RVD tried attempted the strategy of ""hit & move"" when it came to Brock but he eventually did catch him into a powerbomb.  Brock had the superior power advantage which he showcased like hold RVD over this shoulder before driving him into the corner & a powerslam before RVD took advantage of Brock's momentum to get some hits in & even hit the 5 Star Frog Splash but Brock still kept coming including catching RVD in mid-air to deliver an F5.  This was a short & sweet match which did it's job in continuing to display Brock as an unstoppable athletic monster.
King Of The Ring '02

Hulk Hogan vs. Kurt Angle - Kurt came into this match wearing his amateur wrestling headgear with the wig underneath after his head shaving from Edge the previous month.  Hulk stayed in control early by sending Kurt to the outside various times & controlling the ring before Angle resorted to dirty tactics to get advantage & work over Hogan's back with various suplexes before Hogan was able to counter with his own.  Angle continued to target the back & even did an AngleSlam before Hogan ""hulked up"" causing Angle to resort to using a chair that ended up backfiring on him.  It was a good match that they would later top on SmackDown weeks later (check Hogan's latest DVD set for that match) with a result that was very well done.
King Of The Ring '02

Bobby Lashley vs. Booker T - The King Of The Ring returned for the first time in almost four years as a SmackDown exclusive tournament.  Booker attempted to talk trash to Lashley but got a response of being shoved down to the ground before Lashley landed a bunch of explosive clotheslines.  Lashley's momentum had his shoulder accidentally hit the ring post leaving the opening for Booker to take advantage by using the ringpost & the ropes to work over the shoulder but Lashley kept coming including a shoulderblock that turned Booker inside out.  Both men were determined & kicked out of each others signature moves before Sharmell & someone else Lashley had issues with at this time got involved.  The end result was the birth of King Booker but keep watching as Lashley decided to crown Booker himself.
Judgment Day '06

C.M. Punk vs. William Regal - This edition of the tournament took place on RAW in 2008 with C.M. Punk coming into this match with a bad back from his earlier match while Regal was fresher due to not having as competitive matches as Punk did (he fought Hornswoggle & an injured Finlay) while it should also be noted that Regal was the RAW General Manager at this time too.  Regal gained control after countering the bulldog attempt into a suplex that landed Punk on the back of his head before going to work on the back stretching it.  Punk kept going after Regal's head with various strikes & kicks including one that looked like it almost knocked him out but his back was just in too much pain with Regal was able to take advantage of after a failed attempt at a G.T.S.  This wasn't as competitive as we would get from these almost a year later in their Intercontinental Championship match but it did it's job in establishing the new king.
""RAW"" Apr. '08

John Morrison vs. Sheamus - A couple of notes here in that Morrison wrestled one more match in the tournament than Sheamus while the ring announcer for this match was ""Miss U.S.A."" who was also on the latest season of ""WWE Tough Enough."" These two told a great story with Sheamus taking a page out of the ""Anderson"" playbook by completely focusing on Morrison's arm throughout the match with various moves like a single arm DDT, yanking Morrison off the top rope onto his shoulder, hammerlocks & armbars, and even hitting blocking Morrison's ""Starship Pain"" with knees into his arm. Morrison gave a good effort but this was all about Sheamus being completely ruthless & becoming King.

(Blu-Ray) Steve Austin vs. Marc Mero - This was the first semi-final match of the night with Austin keeping a slow pace grounding Mero & constantly breaking attempts for him to gain some momentum either using his own momentum against him or stopping it dead in it's tracks while having no problems bending the rules to his advantage while Mero picked up the pace using an aerial assault from different positions while also relying on his past boxing background causing Austin to be busted open from the lips as they traded momentum throughout this competitive match.

(Blu-Ray) WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker vs. Triple H - Paul Heyman was on commentary for this match as his client Brock Lesnar won the King Of The Ring tournament right before this match guaranteeing him a title match at SummerSlam against possibly one of these two men. Both men started trading punches right away with the action getting taken to the outside in the early moments as Undertaker focused on a part of the body using power offense & strikes while being able to stop any momentum his opponent attempted to mount various times only for Triple H to mount comebacks using his own power before things started to get out of control with another person who had an interest in this match making their presence known as well.

(Blu-Ray) Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton - This was an opening round match with the backstory of Orton being the man who was pinned & cost Angle the World Championship weeks earlier at WrestleMania 22 with Angle being very aggressive tossing Orton around & even applying the anklelock in the early moments of the match before Orton was able to heavily work over an injured area from stretches to submissions including pushing the limits of a possible disqualification while continuing to keep countering Angle's attempt at offense in what was a physical match between both men to the point where one man wouldn't be satisfied until his opponent wasn't able to leave without an injury.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '06

(Blu-Ray) C.M. Punk vs. Chris Jericho - This was a non-title match & semi-final round match as both men were evenly matched early on before one was able to target & focus on the mid-section area including catching his opponent in mid-springboard by kicking the rope out from under him as both men continued to go through a series of counters & pin reversals with one opponent continuing to keep coming out a step ahead before one man was able to catch the other & capitalize on an opening in a good encounter.
""RAW"" Apr. '08

(Blu-Ray) Daniel Bryan vs. Alberto Del Rio - A quarter-final round match that saw Del Rio attack different areas of the body from the head to his arm while Bryan attempted to use his fast paced offense including diverse kicks & suicide dive as this ultimately came down to one man capitalizing on another's injury occurring during the match.

In the end, this was a nice chronicle of the history of not only the tournament but also the PPV itself.  While some people may want to see each & every single tournament final & King crowned, the title of this set is call ""The Best Of..."" and I'm personally glad they didn't waste our time with the flops like King Mabel.  The only thing I would have changed is to include the 1-2-3 Kid vs. Owen Hart match from the 1994 tournament since that was my favorite match from that tournament (I would have added Bret vs. Perfect match from the 1993 edition if it wasn't already on Bret Hart's DVD).
