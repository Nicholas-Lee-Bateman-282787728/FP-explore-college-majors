8303104,5,B001FY2MKQ,"The movie is five stars.  But I want to emphasize a warning about the French Blu-Ray (labeled ""The Barber"" on the front cover.)  You can either have the movie with dubbed French without subtitles or you can have it without dubbed French with forced subtitles.  You cannot watch it in English without subtitles at the same time.  If you speak English, expect to be annoyed and frustrated by this Blu Ray.",1377734400,8,403,4.633802816901408
8303105,5,B001FY2MKQ,"Set in 1950, the Coen brothers' THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE (USA/UK-2001) is a modern film that comes as close to classic noir as any ever made.

Featuring subdued narration by the main character and inventively shadowed cinematography with many unusual angles and forced perspective, this is the story of a town barber (Billy Bob Thornton), a normally quiet man who murders in self-defense when his act of revenge, an anonymous blackmail scheme, goes awry and the victim (James Gandolfini) learns his identity.

A superb cast includes Frances McDormand as Billy Bob's cheating wife, Tony Shaloub playing the high-priced lawyer who is unable to defend her when she's wrongly charged with Gandolfini's murder, Michael Badalucco as the chatty owner of the barbershop where Thornton works, Jon Polito as a dry cleaning scam artist who inadvertantly sets the blackmail in motion by tempting Thornton to invest 10K, and Scarlett Johansson as a teen amateur pianist that Billy Bob unsuccessfully tries to mentor.

Recurring use of Beethoven's somber Pathetique piano sonata is ideal as background music to this relentlessly sad story. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is an atmospheric, introspective tale of ultimate tragedy that, like all great cinema, gets better with repeated viewings. Highest recommendation!",1351468800,3,1299,5.357843137254902
