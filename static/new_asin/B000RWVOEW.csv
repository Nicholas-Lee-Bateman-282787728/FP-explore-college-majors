8609683,5,B000RWVOEW,"I'll warn you here and now that this is an awful movie, if you have no sense of humor. This ""film"" takes an old 70's Hong Kong action film about gangs, hacks it into bits and makes it about Ninjas. American ninjas.
The editing and dubbing is awful....but its so freakin' hilarious. I mean, you can't take this movie seriously at all. I had watched with a friend a while back and we were laughing our heads off near the end. Ninja Hunt is a bad movie if you're looking for something serious, but really good if you want some laughs.

All right, along with the plot synopsis. Warning! Spoilers ahead!

Apparently, these evil ninjas somehow manage to break into the CIA HQ and steal a tape (never specified what kind of tape) called DAK 10 which apparently can tach anyone every single way to kill a person and instill them with insaitable bloodlust. Anyways, the ninjas escape into Hong Kong, and the CIA sends their best agent, An American ninja hunter, Gordon (who also happens to be a ninja himself) to recover the tape. Gordon is lazy, so he sends a Chinese man, redubbed ""Aaron"" to infiltrate the Chinese gang and do something important that has to with the ninjas (Somehow....) while Gordon goes off to talk to this old Chinese woman about their ""son"" ""Billy"" (Who is fully asian and has no trait of his supposed ""father"" at all....yeahhhh) and then goes to fight a ninja in a tree, killing him by fake stabbing him in the side. Then he makes Aaron drive him around in a taxi and explains that he needs Aaron to keep an eye on ""Campbell"" and his gang as they are interested in purchasing DAK 10 and Aaron must prevent this while Gordon goes and hunts ninjas....somehow.
I'm not going to keep going, as you can probably see just how stupid this film gets. The ninja plot doesn't even fit into the spliced film at all, the ""actors"" don't even try and at the final battle, the Ninja wear headbands that tell you they're ninjas. You know, just in case you forgot.

All in all, its probably not worth what anyone's charging for it, but hey if you see on sale for a dollar, its a good laugh. (At least for me it was)",1304467200,,2114,4.40153452685422
