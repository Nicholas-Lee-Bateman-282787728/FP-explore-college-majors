3436878,4,B0019F0302,"It seems like some of the Max and Ruby shorts on this DVD were already on another set but could be wrong... my kids have just watched so much Max and Ruby, it starts to run together after awhile.

The best of the set deal with fall and Halloween, and the others are not theme related.  It's a shame, because there is enough material between this and the previous releases to have filled one with just Halloween/fall shows... my kids loved the first three episodes but the others they were not as crazy about, and this DVD title didn't hold their interest like some of the others.

Their favorites have been Springtime with Max and Ruby, Afternoons with Max and Ruby, Max and Ruby Christmas, and Party Time with Max and Ruby.  Those they have watched over and over again.  I don't see this destined to getting the same kind of repeat airplay.",1220054400,9,841,4.470588235294118

3436884,4,B0019F0302,My four year old has loved Max and Ruby for a couple years now and was missing it since Cable dropped Nick this year.  This makes a perfect video for the car since the stories are short enough to be seen in a short normal car trip.,1413417600,,231,3.9148936170212765

He picked a Max and Ruby DVD.  I was really surprised...but it's what he wanted and daughter appreciates the few free minutes it gives her to do whatever. So I bought him 2 autumn holiday related DVDs and suggested to his great gram to buy winter holiday DVDs.",1321142400,2,381,4.366197183098592

3436893,5,B0019F0302,"We are fans of Max and Ruby because they celebrate the different-but-equal relationship between masculine and feminine, and show how they can be tolerant of the differences.

We especially like the Perfect Pumpkin dvd. Some of the stories are about Halloween, and some are just about Fall with a harvest celebration. Ruby is a little less big-sister-bossy and shows more love for her scared little brother. The stories also seem to include Ruby in a different way, more of a main part of the stories with an equal focus on both her and Max.

We also recommend the Christmas ones. Very cute.

Friends have made comments that the parents are not seen in the show, and we tell them That is not the Point! This is about the love between a brother and sister who annoy the heck out of each other. Good stuff.",1254614400,3,803,4.5625
3436894,5,B0019F0302,"We have been collecting the Max & Ruby DVD's as they have been released.  I love the show as much as our little ones!  As more and more of these 4 episode DVDs were released, I started to doubt we'd ever get complete season sets like Spongebob.  This meant the entire series would never be available.  I started to look up on the Internet how many episodes have been released and watching Nick Jr. and Noggin daily I kept abreast of any new episodes.

When this DVD was announced, I knew there was one episode from the 1st Season that still hadn't been released.  I was so excited to find it included with the remaining 3 newer episodes.  So, I am happy to announce that if you love the show as much as we do - and you want to own EVERY episode, it is NOW possible.  Who would've thought the entire series would be released this way?  They must be great selling DVDs for them to keep producing new ones until they ran out of episodes!

Here are the other 9 Max & Ruby Nick Jr. DVDs you need to have the entire series:

Max & Ruby's Christmas
Springtime For Max & Ruby
Max & Ruby's Halloween
Party Time with Max & Ruby
Afternoons with Max & Ruby
Easter with Max & Ruby
Summertime with Max & Ruby
A Merry Bunny Christmas
Berry Bunny Adventures

Hope you enjoy them as much as we do!  THANKS Nick Jr. for releasing them all!!!",1228089600,12,1323,4.2023809523809526
