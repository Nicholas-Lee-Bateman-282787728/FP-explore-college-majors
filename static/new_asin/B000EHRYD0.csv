8110195,5,B000EHRYD0,"What a joy to see possibly the greatest of Christian rock artists perform. They are like Enya meets Yes and the message is Christ. They aren't The Who onstage, but they have to pay great attention to the detail of their art, and it shows. You will be impressed.",1303776000,,261,4.346938775510204
8110196,1,B000EHRYD0,"I love IONA, but this DVD was a BIG disappointment. Couldn't wait for it to get over. Seemed like a low budget half hearted production with zero enthusiasm or zeal. Definitely didn't capture the IONA I've enjoyed over the years.",1267056000,,228,4.725
8110197,5,B000EHRYD0,"The DVD Iona -- Live in London, released in mid-2006, captures the band at the University of London in November 2004. The 2-disc DVD gives you the complete concert, although the 5-song acoustic set that normally would have been played between ""Wave after Wave"" and ""Inside My Heart"" (I'm not sure if that placement held true this evening) is here on the bonus features disc. The main disc, of the plugged section of the concert, later was released as an audio CD. The interviews with band members on the bonus disc are a plus as well.

Every member of this extremely talented band is in very fine form indeed and does superlative work -- including Troy Donockley, who was very ill at the time. The acoustic set contains very interesting rearrangements of three very old Iona songs, along with two primarily Dave Bainbridge/Donockley collaborations. ""Chi-Rho"" is performed in a very low-key manner -- too low-key for my tastes, as lead singer Joanne Hogg seems devoid of emotion this time around. ""Edge of the World,"" meanwhile, gets perhaps its best rendition ever, marked by some jazzy keyboard playing by Bainbridge. A remake of ""Today,"" with recorded percussion that frees Frank Van Essen to play violin, is not for everyone; personally, I far prefer the band's previous versions than this folk-oriented one. ""Greenfields of Canada"" and ""Jigs"" are fine, but I'd have preferred to hear other Iona tunes.

But if the acoustic set is a bit of a mixed bag, the plugged sections on the main disc are outstanding. Highlights include the always jaw-dropping ""Encircling,"" arguably Iona's best live song; ""Wave after Wave,"" which features an astonishing vocal performance from Hogg; the always welcome ""Inside My Heart"" and ""Bi-Se i Mo Shuil Part 2""; and a ""Flight of the Wild Goose"" that manages to sound different from all of Iona's three previous album versions.

Iona may never make it to the United States again for a tour, and Iona recordings keep getting less frequent, so if you're an American fan, you may well want to get this DVD. It may be the only chance you have to see them live, and so it's worth your time and money.",1236902400,5,2128,4.808743169398907
8110198,5,B000EHRYD0,"This DVD is simply amazing! First,the DVD is recorded in 5.1 surround sound,so it sounds like the person watching the concert is at the show. The main reason to watch this DVD is to see the band perform,and perform they do. Every member puts their all,(and then some),into this show. The guitar player Dave Bainbridge,hands down,is the best guitar player that I have ever seen. Second,the DVD has great extras,like a five song acoustic set,and interviews. If you like IONA,or even just like irish music,then get this DVD.",1230076800,3,521,4.931818181818182
8110199,5,B000EHRYD0,"One either likes Iona or one does not.  If you are a fan it seems impossible that you wouldn't like this video.  The band is in fine form in front of an enthusiastic, though seemingly rather small audience.  They give us lots of  good stuff from their catalogue to enjoy along with a couple of new numbers.
One thing I was disturbed about in the interview section, and this has nothing to do with the quality of the performance, was the desire on their part to divorce themselves from Christianity in order (it would seem) to gain wider recognition.  All their music has been  marketed here (in the U. S) as ""Christian music,"" especially the live album  Woven Cord with the All Souls Orchestra, an ecumenical group of professed believers, and The Book of Kells, with its almost liturgical Christian feel. Well, they are grown-ups, and can do what they want.
Nonetheless, a great performance; I only wish I had surround sound capture the whole sonic experience.",1215475200,,960,4.712574850299402
8110200,5,B000EHRYD0,"When I saw that Iona had a dvd in the works I ordered it directly from their website. Not knowing that the exchange rate from euros to dollars would be so steep, the dvd ended up costing me about $36.00. Now, having watched the dvd at least 25 times, I'm here to tell you that I would pay that price again if that's what it took to get a copy.

Let me preface this review by saying that I am a big fan of Iona music. I have all of their cd's and very much enjoy listening to them through the headphones, dissecting each and every arrangement. Utilizing electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards, violin, uilleann pipes, bouzoukis, bass, drums, whistles and an angelic voice, Iona manages to weave its way through intricate time signature and musical passages that are satisfying to the casual listener, as well as the serious listener like myself.

This dvd has it all. It comes with chapter selections, interviews, an acoustic set and a 5.1 surround sound that is better than I've heard on any other concert dvd, and I have about 25 of those now. It has music from their first cd to their newest cd. It has instrumental songs, and it has songs with vocals. Some are in the four minute range, while others are in the ten minute range. Some of the songs have a very ambient sound to them, some are melody line oriented, and some explode with blistering guitar and whistle/pipe solos. The music is performed flawlessly, and with lots and lots of solos. Even the filming of the concert is 5 star. There are many close-ups, and the cameras actually stay in one place long enough to be able to appreciate the great musicianship.

If you like great music and a dvd that makes you feel like you're at the concert, then this dvd is for you.",1179446400,10,1731,4.454258675078864
8110201,5,B000EHRYD0,"Just got this DVD today (ordered from the IONA website) and have to say it is AWESOME!  If you are an IONA fan like me then this is a must.  I have not been to the UK and don't see any prospects for doing so in the near future so this was an excellent opportunity to see these folks in concert.  I have just about all of their CD's and have even given some away to others to spread the word.  Joanne's voice drills right into you every time.  Dave's guitar work is masterful and Troy's pipework is amazing to watch.

In short from beginning to end this DVD will take you on a ride with one of the best group of musicians I have listened to in a very long time.  Right up there with Renaissance (with Annie Haslam) in my book.",1169856000,2,725,4.027972027972028
