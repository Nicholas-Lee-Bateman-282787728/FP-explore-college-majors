1329698,3,B00003ES3E,"The scene with Rock Hudson in which Jack Colvin (playing Dr. Winston)was torn between medical ethics and mere trust in a dear friend is the pivotal moment in this film. The excruciating agony in which Dr. Winston is debating in his subconscious is no doubt evident in this accomplished actors face. Dr. Winston makes no promise at that time but we can tell that an internal battle will be raging within him until his final decision can be made.  Later Dr. Winston, in full operating gear, calls Rock to inform him that he's got what Rock's looking for.  Fatigue and uncertainty is worn well on the actors face, for the result( as later we learn) could be disastrous.

Jack Colvin, the greatest character actor of the 20th and possibly the 21st century hits another homerun in this ""pre-Jack Mcgee"" performance.  I believe before Rock Hudson passed on he was quoted as saying, ""One of the greatest accomplishments of my life was working with the legendary Jack Colvin.""",1108684800,3,968,4.778443113772455
1329699,3,B00003ES3E,"EMBRYO is about Dr. Paul Holliston (Rock Hudson), a scientist who has recently lost his wife (also a scientist). Holliston hits a doberman with his car (a 3 ton cadillac) on his way home one stormy night. He rushes the dog home to his lab, where he is unable to save her. However, the doberman is pregnant, so the good doctor keeps the doggy fetus alive, injecting it with an experimental growth hormone. The little canine grows at an amazing rate, reaching adulthood within hours! Holliston names the dog ""Number One"" and is astonished by it's intelligence (the dog gets it's own food out of the fridge, drops the empty bowl in the sink, opens doors, etc.). Unbeknownst to the doc, Number One also has a mean streak, as is displayed when it kills another dog and hides it's body. Of course, Holliston thinks everything's great, and soon looks for a human fetus to try his serum on. He gets his chance when another doctor helps him acquire a fetus from a doomed prostitute. Back in the lab, Dr. H. performs his latest experiment with similar results. He watches as the fetus grows up at super-speed. Next thing he knows, he's got an adult woman on his hands (Barbara Carrera), with superior intellectual powers matched only by her exotic beauty. Some of the best parts of the movie come when she is busy absorbing knowledge. Named ""Victoria"", she is introduced at a party as Holliston's new assistant. In one fun scene, Victoria plays an arrogant chess master (Roddy McDowall) to a humiliating finish. Unfortunately, things get serious when Victoria starts getting sick and figures out that she is not long for this world. This causes her to seek out the method by which she can stay alive, at the expense of others. A pretty good mad scientist thriller, EMBRYO has enough creepy / funny moments to keep my interest...",1092268800,28,1818,4.702194357366771
1329700,5,B00003ES3E,"I have seen Embryo twice on television and I have enjoyed it both times. It is an interesting drama with a touch of science that presents the dangers of cloning, which is quite a futuristic view since the movie was  released in only 1975, decades before ""Dolly"", the cloned sheep.  For the most part, it is scientifically sound and is an original concept  for a movie.
Rock Hudson stars as the doctor who finds an injured dog on  the road and takes it home to nurse back to health. The doctor has been  working on advanced growth formulae, however, and is able to regenerate (or  clone) the dog within a matter of weeks. He is thrilled with his success  and decides to make the giant leap to cloning a human. Not only does this  intrigue the viewer, but introduces an eerie and suspenseful feeling about  what is going to happen, especially when his ""cloned"" dog has an  encounter with a small white dog (you'll have to see the movie to find out  what happens here).
His ""cloned"" human is a girl named  Victoria, nicely played by Barbara Carrera. Within days she is a beautiful,  fully-grown adult with the remarkable ability to learn quickly and retain  knowledge. She becomes very close to the doctor and helps him with his  research. Then, near the end of the movie, something goes terribly wrong.  It shows how an experiment can take a turn for the worse and is a warning  to the limits of human testing. You will definitely have to watch the end  of the movie to understand what I mean.

Embryo is successful as both a  drama and pseudo-science movie. It was merely by chance that I watched it  on T.V., but I'm glad I did because it was well worth it. The acting by  Hudson and Carrera is well done, but I think the story idea itself makes  this movie good. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind to  science and the future.",958953600,14,1845,4.4226190476190474

This movie probably wouldn't get made today because of the political issues concerning fetuses, abortion, embryos, etc.  Even so I thought it was enjoyable mainly because of Barbara Carrera who is beautiful in here.  The science behind it is completely unrealistic but that doesn't get in the way of the melodramatics!

This title is available on about a hundred other bargain bin DVD sets (anything with ""sci-fi"" label on it and chances are ""Embryo"" is stuffed away on there somewhere) but I wanted the single DVD edition because I'm a chump. Barbara Carrera is a doll, and she's on full display here at a couple of points, but this really isn't an offensive movie.

1329733,4,B00003ES3E,"This film makes you think about real issues like genetic experimenting, cloning, drug side effects and fooling with mother nature.  The plot of the 1975 film Embryo is about a scientist named Paul Holliston played by Rock Hudson who hits a Doberman one dark and stormy night.  He brings the dog back to his laboratory and lays it on a table.  After examining the badly injured dog he realized that she is pregnant.  In an attempt to save her three pups Dr. Holliston removes them and injects them with a growth hormone.  Two of the pups die but one servives.  After the mother dog dies and the pup must live without her blood Dr. Holliston administers more of the drugs to the pup.  He begins growing at an incredibly fast rate and in a short amount of time is fully grown.  At first his experiment seems to be a huge success.  The dog who the doctor names number one is perfectly formed and highly intelligent.  He quickly learns tricks like getting his own food dish and putting it in the sink when he is finished.  But, we soon see that number one has a dark side when the dog is outside by himself and he sees a little dog who is barking st him.  Number one picks the dog up in his teeth shacks him until he is dead hides him in the grass and then number one gets in the doctors car and closes the door behind him so that the doctor will not know what he has done.  unaware of the dogs evil side the doctor decides to experiment on a human fetus.  The human fetus also grows very quickly and in a matter of weeks is an adult woman who the doctor names Victoria.  Victoria and the doctor are very close and even have sex together! Then Victoria begins having crippling abdominal pains.  She doesn't tell the doctor but trys to find out what the problem is herself.  When she learns that she is aging rapidly and will die.  The only way she will live is if she kills someone to get what she needs to survive.  The dog number one also begins going more crazy and chasing and growling at Dr. Holiston and his assistant. When Dr. Holliston learns the truth about Victoria commiting murder his feelings for her completely change and he now wants to destroy his creation.

I remember it as being better. Of course that might have been the ""crush"" remembering. Now, many years later, I found it laughable.

I will say the, the acting was good. Even though the movie was a bit "" smelly"", no one phoned their part in. I would have given this film a 5-star rating for that and for nostolaga. However, the Prime copy was terrible; almost unwatchable. So it got a 3-star....again, for the acting and the nostolaga.

The result is so steeped in the aesthetics and ideology of its time, that, despite its not being a great movie, anyone interested in any of the above, or in science fiction cinema, or in film adaptations of literature, ought to check it out. If you do, be patient: the first half is very tedious. The pay off begins about halfway through; and the finale, including the very last minute is quite astonishing.

SYNOPSES--

THE STEAGLE (1971) - Richard Benjamin, Chill Wills, Cloris Leachman, Susan Tyrrell, Diane Ladd
Normally reserved college professor Benjamin loses all inhibitions during the Cuban Missle Crisis. Leaving home unexpectedly he adopts a pseudonym and flies to Vegas, where he gambles and has affairs. As ""the REAL Andy Hardy"" he meets aging cowboy star Wills. The two intoxicated men visit a bombed-out war set at the actor's former studio. In a strange highlight of this most unusual picture they fantasize they're machine-gunning WWI and WWII soldiers, plus a variety of western Indians, Arabs, armor-clad knights, Rebs and Union soldiers.

Middling sci-fier about a scientist who invents a method of accelerating gestation so that a fetus becomes an adult human in days rather than decades.

This is an extremely muddy transfer that I doubt will be rectified in the future because of the relative obscurity of the film itself.  In 1968 director Ralph Nelson tackled the issue of science and ethics in what I consider to be a disappointing result with ""Charly"".  I found that film today as a dated psychedelic artifact.  What I found interesting about ""Embryo"" is the way it tackles life issues.  Released in 1976, it came out shortly on the heels of Roe v. Wade and just a few short years before the first test tube baby.  Rock Hudson's character isn't some mad scientist who wants to play God.  Recently widowed, his reasons for creating life are more altruistic.  He even recognizes the necessity of morality to his creation, Victoria(Barbara Carrera), by citing the Bible to her.  Unfortunately, beauty and brains do not alone make us human. Even if you are born when you are 25 years old it takes years to develope a core morality.
