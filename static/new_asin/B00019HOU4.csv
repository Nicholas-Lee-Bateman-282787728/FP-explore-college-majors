1982456,5,B00019HOU4,"As a teenager, not many indian films appeal to me but this did. I only went to see it because i was dragged by my family but i loved it from start to finish. I laughed so hard in the first half, i cried, but in the second half it was so sad i don't think i ever stopped crying. A wonderful film in all respects, and a must see for all the family (including but not limited 2 indians!).",1074384000,,385,3.825
1982457,5,B00019HOU4,"This may well be my favorite not only hindi film, but movie of all time.  The acting is stellar.  Not only from the main characters, but even the smaller supporting roles, Jaya as awlays was wonderful, but in my opinion Sweetu was played to perfection.  For those who have never seen Hindi film, Kal Ho Naa Ho is a perfect introduction.  The dances are choreographed wonderfully, and songs like Pretty Women and Maahi ve will stay with you for days.  However, for the seasoned bollywood viewer, this film still has loads to offer.  Callbacks to such favorites as Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Ghum, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Lagaan, Dil Chahta Hai and guests appearances by Kajol and Rani make this movie worth seeing again and again.",1074384000,3,717,4.696
1982458,5,B00019HOU4,"Being an indian living in America, i found this film very close to my real life. It portrays what life is really like, you live out your day being an american, but go home an indian. Adding to that is wonderful choreography and costumes and excellent music (THATZ THE WAY.....Maahi Ve!). The performances are truly heart wrenching. Saif Ali Khan goes through his role with ease, and shows a true spark in the emotional and comedic sequences. He is an actor to watch out for. Shah Rukh Khan is ok, we have seen much better performances in masterpieces like Asoka and Devdas. But it is virtual newcomer Priety Zinta who steals the show. She manages to convey all the NRI elements perfectly while still mantaining a fire that makes NAina Catherine Kapur so loveable. She also looks ravishingly beautiful. Overall, A film that must be seen......",1073001600,4,841,4.767123287671233
1982459,4,B00019HOU4,"This film has English subtitles for those of us who do not speak Hindi.  Our friend who is Punjabi told us about the film and so we went and shared a delightful experience.  The music is fantastic, the costumes are as colorful as you can imagine them to be, there was humor, drama and romance.  If you get the chance be sure to see this film.  I hope is comes out on video or DVD.",1072051200,14,380,4.026666666666666

1982502,5,B00019HOU4,"Kal Ho Naa Ho is taglined a story of a lifetime in a heartbeat, which is most definitely appropriate. The story of Aman Mathur(Shah Rukh Khan), Naina Kapir(Preity Zinta)and Rohit Patel(Saif Ali Khan)is told so well, that despite its only being a story, the climax scene and the ultimate twist makes you cry. Its impossible to not cry, no matter how many times you have seen the film. The title track is the best, most soulful song of the film, It's the Time to Disco is a cool party number, Maahi Ve is a lovely shaadi(wedding) song, Kuch Toh Hua Hai is well-nothing special, Pretty Woman is damn cool a=but what i really enjoyed was the instrumental, commonly known as Heartbeat Instrumental. Now- for the plot. Naina Catherine Kapur is the depressed eldest child of Jennifer Kapur(Jaya Bachchan)whose husband commit suicide. There is constant conflict in there house because of Jennifer's decision to adopt Gia, which Naina's grandmother believes is the reason her son(Jennifer's husband)commit suicide. Naina attends MBA with her close friend, Rohit Patel(Saif Ali Khan)who is a total flirt. In comes to there lives, the spritely Aman Mathur(SRK) who lives life at the fullest and is always smiling. He, who has moved in to live with his uncle Chadda along with his mom, notices the gloom of his new neighbours and intervenes. Soon, Naina falls for Aman, Rohit for Naina..but then a huge twist changes things forever...
This film is an absolute tear-jerker..a must for all bollywood fans and a good way to start with your first bollywood film,. It proves- bollywood can give you strong emotion..Watch Kal Ho Naa Ho..",1452211200,,1619,4.934065934065934

The movie was very emotional, along with the music, yet some of the music made me want to dance. I went straight to I-Tunes and bought the Soundtrack.

Indian movies and Bollywood are new and exciting for me because I was born in America, and I only speak one language (English).  I have to use captions in English, but I don't mind at all. I would recommend Kal Ho Naa Ho world-wide, for people everywhere.",1374105600,8,578,4.097345132743363

Plot

I don't need to do a plot synopsis past the basics as there are way better on here than mine. Kal ho Naa Ho means you know what you're getting when you open the package. An expiration date in the next three hours. That's all the time you have left to live laugh and love. Twice. Yes I said twice . If you are our heroine you have managed to live with a dearth of it for the past 20 some odd years. If you're SRk you've been making everybody feel the fullness of it for as long as you've been alive. Before you end this movie you will see that you can love again...at the same time.. when three such special actors ,Zinta, Saif ,and Srk are delivering the goods. You'll have to watch to feel the experience.",1337299200,5,880,4.051724137931035

1982597,4,B00019HOU4,"I first saw this film during India Week at my university.  I could only understand about 40% of the dialogue because they couldn't find a remote control to turn on the subtitles.  It didn't matter.  My friends and I were moved by the film even through the language barrier.  Is Kal Ho Naa Ho the best Bollywood film I've seen?  Of course not.  But it will always hold a place in my heart as my introduction to Bollywood.

Kal Ho Naa Ho is a story of love, friendship, and family set in the backdrop of modern New York.  The plot is not particularly original (it can be compared to the earlier Shah Rukh Khan film Kuch Kuch Kota Hai), but the story is moving with a healthy dose of comedy.  The song and dance numbers are fun to watch.  Overall, a movie worth re-watching.",1330128000,3,771,4.291666666666667
1982598,4,B00019HOU4,"In viewing a Bollywood picture it's a must that you check in your cynicism at the door. Else you may get caught unawares. Indian cinema, with its vibrancy and unabashed sentiment and rampant eruption of song and dance, wears its heart on its sleeve. KAL HO NAA HO, which came out in 2003, perfectly typifies this.

The story is set in bustling New York City and narrated in voice-over by the lead female character, sullen 23-year-old Naina Catherine Kapur (Preity Zinta). The film opens during a dark time in Naina's life. She dwells in a half-Punjabi, half-Catholic household, a dangerous state that is grounds for constant bickering between Naina's Catholic mother, Jennifer (Jaya Bachchan), and her embittered, more traditional grandmother. Naina has an adopted little sister who is loathed by the grandma. The Kapurs are about to lose the family restaurant. All the tension and ill feelings root back to an old family tragedy. It's resulted in Naina's having to grow up too soon. She's pretty much become the adult in the fam. She has no time for trivial activities such as having fun or smiling. She wears glasses that only enhance her severe demeanor.

She does enjoy the occasional innocent flirtation with her wealthy friend, Rohit Patel (Saif Ali Khan), whom she met while attending a New York university. But it's not until an offbeat stranger moves into her neighborhood that her life is truly sent topsy-turvy. Aman Mathur (Shah Rukh Khan) is one of them cats imbued with an infectious zest for life and he wastes no time in impacting everyone in the community. He makes particular efforts to extend a friendly hand towards Naina's troubled family. Aman is so charismatic that he promptly launches an impromptu block party. But he's hiding a secret, and it's a secret devastating enough that not only is he willing to relinquish his one shot at love, he schemes to make the girl he adores fall in love with someone else. Keep in mind that most Bollywood films tend to start out bright and peppy and full of silly humor, but then predictably segue into sweeping tear-jerkers. And Shah Rukh Khan, India's leading box office superstar, is never happy unless he's making his audience reach for a hankie. Shah Rukh, like the film industry in which he toils, has no intention of demonstrating restraint.

He turns in a towering performance (some may say over-the-top). Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan are both marvelous. This was Zinta's best performance up to that stage in her career. Saif not only handles the somber scenes well, he also walks away with the best comedic moments. Director Nikhil Advani and writer Karan Johar manage to distinctively draw the three actors' parts, and I love how the dynamics alter depending on which characters were interacting with whom. Naina and Rohit exhibit an effortless chemistry, and you believe they could be friends, but then you also believe Rohit's unspoken pining for her. Naina and Aman share a more fractious relationship. She hates him on sight (he teases her and calls her ""Specsy""), but then his antics and big heart eventually wear down her defenses and she tumbles head over heels for him. So theirs is a stormy affair, especially since Aman's secret compels him to pretend he isn't in love with her. A terrific bromance develops between Aman and Rohit, and Johar mines this for plenty of comic scenes. And when all three are hanging out together, there's a fun playful vibe that surfaces. Which makes it all the more wrenching when, later on, it all falls apart for them. You may find yourself reaching for a whole mess of tissues. Which leaves Shah Rukh feeling all kinds of smug. He's done it again. He's made you cry.

KAL HO NAA HO (""Tomorrow May Never Come"") clocks in at an expansive three hours, so by the end you do feel like these characters are old friends. But a bulk of the running time is dedicated to the extravagant musical numbers which, by the way, do advance the plot. While I wasn't down with all the songs, I did hum along to the energetic, Bhangra-influenced ""Pretty Woman,"" the cute retro ""It's Time to Disco,"" the melodic and wistful ""Kuch To Hua Hai,"" and the soulful title song. Meanwhile, ""Mahi Ve"" has Kajol and Rani Mukerjee making special appearances.

This DVD offers sub-titles in English (and also in Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam). It gives you the option to skip directly to the musical numbers. It also has Director Nikhil Advani's commentary (in English).",1328400000,3,4480,4.8433420365535245
1982599,5,B00019HOU4,"First of all, I bought the blu ray through Amazon and not any of their vendors. It's not listed in the specs but it IS all region and it DOES have English subtitles for any who were wondering and for those of us who haven't mastered the language yet, despite the tons of Bollywood movies we've watched. The quality is excellent, so I'm very pleased and relieved that everything is good. This movie is a great movie if you're in the mood for a tear-jerker. The first time I watched it I hated it, but decided some time later to give it another chance. If you have watched it once before and hated it, you might want to try it again--you might end up liking it. SRK really is very dramatic in this, maybe a little over-the-top, but I love his dramatics. And if you're not an SRK fan don't even bother watching it, because you will probably just be annoyed anyway. Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta are good in their roles also. Now that I know what to expect from this movie I love it. The songs are also great and really get you moving.",1325808000,,1032,4.243654822335025
1982600,5,B00019HOU4,"While the setting is in America, this is a great first Bollywood movie for Americans who have had little or no exposure to Indian cinema.  For those not familiar with Bollywood hits, most (this one included) are very long and in a dedicated theater (such as FunAsia near Dallas where I saw it) will be played with an intermission (which is great there as they have more than popcorn and candy :D ).

The movie centers around an Indian man (played by S.R.K.) who comes to America for medical care and falls for a young woman (played by Preinta Zinta).  Any more would include spoilers, so I will stop here...",1325635200,,607,4.5
1982601,4,B00019HOU4,"I believe this is the third film from Karan Johar.  His first two (that I have, that are wonderful stories) are ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", and ""Kabhie Kushi Khabbi Gham"".  So, after those two great films I thought that this film would be just as wonderful.

It's OK, I guess.  I wouldn't say that ""I don't like it"" because I love all the main characters in this film.  Of course, Yash Raj, and Karan Johar continues their investment in having Shah Rukh Khan as their leading man.  But, then we also get Priety Zinta (who was with Shah Rukh Khan in ""Veer-Zaara"", and ""Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna""), and Saif Ali Khan from some other great Bollywood films in the past 10 years.  So, just about any movie that has more than three big names in Bollywood is definitely going to be successful.

But, the one thing that makes this movie real important to me is that it also stars Sonali Bendre who is such a beautiful Hindi actress.  It's great to have at least one Blu-Ray high definition film featuring Sonali Bendre.

Just for the fun of it, they had a small cameo of the ever beautiful Kajol and also my favorite Bollywood actress Rani Mukherji (dancing in a song video) of which these two were also in ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", and ""Kabhie Kushi Khabbi Gham"" together and with Shah Rukh Khan.

If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:

First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.
The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.
Bollywood films are very colorful.  All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.
About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent).
About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.
One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)

So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Thouugh I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago.  And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar.",1320969600,2,2787,4.534930139720559

1982615,5,B00019HOU4,"""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" (Tranlation: Tomorrow may or may not be) is an excellent movie that Indians and non-Indians will both love. And it comes with a powerful message that you should make the most of the present day, rather than waiting until it's too late.

You meet Naina Kapoor, a young Indian woman living in New York City with her family. Naina is devoid of happiness and fun, and you learn the reasons why as she tells her story. You meet her closest friends, Rohit and Sweetu, other characters in her crazy life, and finally...Aman. Aman is the answer to Naina's prayers, as you see how he helps to pacify the very conflicts that made Naina so uptight. Naina becomes a completely different person (in a good way), and she starts to develop feelings for her ""angel"".

I won't reveal the rest of the story to you because you need to see it for yourself. But I will say that this is my favorite Bollywood movie to date, as well as one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in any language. The characters are fairly well-developed, you get some plot twists in all the right places, and the music and dancing are superb. Lastly, if you really get into good films, you're bound to cry through some sad parts.

I hope this review and others didn't set your expectations too high that you'll scrutinize the movie. Yes, a few parts are a bit cheesy, but there aren't that many of them. Enjoy!",1294272000,,1387,4.452755905511811

The lead actors are all great. Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta are my favourites. I know Shah Rukh Khan is an exponent of a particular mix of comedy and melodrama but I found his performance to be too heavy on the emoting at times. But that is a personal thing and I did tear up in the appropriate scenes which shows his mastery.

There are some Bollywood cliches that have to be accepted at face value eg some sexism, mild xenophobia etc and a one song (Pretty Woman) that is cringeworthy.

However most of the songs and associated dances are so great. I bought the CD and have listened to it many times (sans Pretty Woman).

1982621,4,B00019HOU4,"The American dream isn't always everything it's cracked up to be. There may be lots of opportunities in the U.S., but success and happiness are still hard to come by here. 'Kal Ho Naa Ho' is a story of three Indians living in exciting New York City, struggling personally, and stuck in an impossible love triangle.

Naina (Preity Zinta) is a young woman working on her MBA and dealing with problems at home. She's depressed over her father's suicide and worried about her stressed-out mother, Jenny (Jaya Bachchan), who's trying to raise her much-younger brother, Shiv, and sister, Gia, while working to keep the failing family restaurant afloat. Jenny's mother-in-law, Dadi, lives with them, and she cruelly blames Jenny for her son's death and ignores Gia because she's adopted. Dadi is also pressuring Naina to agree to an arranged marriage, but Naina is incapable of giving her heart to anyone.

Naina has one bright spot in her life--her friend Rohit (Saif Ali Khan), who attends business school with her. Rohit is a nice, good-looking, wealthy guy, who's constantly hitting on women, and for some inexplicable reason, he keeps striking out. He doesn't find the drab and doleful Naina attractive--nor is she interested in him--but they enjoy each other's company.

Things get so bad at Naina's house that the family prays for an angel to rescue them--and one arrives when Aman (Shahrukh Khan) moves into the neighborhood. He immediately endears himself to everyone he meets--except Naina, who finds his forwardness off-putting--and he starts solving all their problems, including Naina's, because he loves her. He eventually inspires her to smile again, and she begins to love him back, but they can't be together, for reasons revealed later in the film. Rohit sees the new, lively Naina differently--as more than a friend.

The film was helmed by debutant director Nikhil Advani (who went on to direct 'Salaam-E-Ishq' in 2007 and 'Chandni Chowk to China' in 2009), but it was co-written and produced by Karan Johar, who's known for directing romantic dramas set in Western countries, such as 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' (2001) and 'Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna' (2006), and Johar's earmarks are all over 'Kal Ho Naa Ho.' His signature themes and style--ranging from parent worship to gay innuendo--make the film sing. And the Naina-Aman-Rohit love triangle gets straightened out in typical Johar fashion--with an emotional bulldozer.

My favorite song and dance number is Pretty Woman. Next comes the title song, which is very beautiful, with profound lyrics, and a haunting melody. I've played these two songs over and over again on the dvd.

I don't think I've cried so much during a movie as I did with this one, which shows how incredible SRK's acting ability is. He is totally believable in his character. He made me laugh at his happy-go-lucky, free spirit, and his singing and dancing were wonderful to watch. Then you get to see his sad, melancholy side and your heart just melts.

The other characters were very good, too, and altogether, a real family was accurately portrayed, with all of its ups and downs, assets and flaws. I think that's what made this movie so special to me--it was REAL, not fake. Just get your hankies out, or a box of tissues, because you'll need them (which is a good thing!).

1982646,4,B00019HOU4,"Spoilers ahead!!!

The plot is fairly simple.  We have a love triangle with a twist.  Boy loves girl, girl loves another boy, other boy loves girl. The twist comes when everyone finds out that Aman (Shah Ruhk Kahn) is dying.  He has a bad heart.  He knows this and pushes Naina away from him and towards her long time friend who has fallen in love with her.

There are several subplots:  Naina's family is in financial trouble.  Jennifer, (Naina's mom) and her mother in law always fight.  There is a family secret that no one knows.  There are acutually many subplots so you have to pay attention. American viewers who haven't seen any Hindi films may find it difficult to get used to some things.  They use buckets of those glycerin tears which look terrible.  This movie is a musical as most Bollywood films are.  Some of the artists tend to overact and movements are sometimes over-eggerated and jerky.  Hindi films tend to be much longer than american films so be cautioned.  By the way, there are about 200 dancers in the film.  The musical numbers usually tend to be dance numbers as well.  Beware of the subtitles.  They move pretty quickly.

There are 6 songs in the film, not a lot for a Bollywood movie.  The title song, Kal Ho Naa Ho is the hit song and it's a lovely tune.  My other favorite is Maahi Ve.  It's the time for Disco, another of the films tunes, is just silly.

As for the film's star, Shah Ruhk Kahn, I don't think he is a particularly great actor but he's got a good screen presence.  His looks don't hurt him either.  He's very cute.  He's also a very capable dancer.

Kal Ho Naa Ho is constructed to be a tear jerker (A Bollywood staple.  Most of their films have the same formula).  It is and oh so obvious.  It's colorful and energetic and funny in places.  It's also meant to be a comedy.  It is funny, even in some places it's not supposed to be.

This makes a good first film because it was filmed in Manhattan.  It's nice to see places you know even when the film is a foreign one.  The more I see this movie the more I like it.  I can overlook it's flaws and concentrate on it's main point.  Kal Ho Naa Ho (tomorrow may never come).  How true.  If you'd like to see something different please buy this.  I won't give away the end.  See it for yourself.",1131753600,12,2289,4.304245283018868

  In an age where there are so many movies coming out of Hollywood that glorify our baser instincts, it is wonderful to see a movie like this that celebrates what we can be is we simply choose to be good, kind people.  It is ironic that a film that celebrates what Christians would call 'traditional values' should come out of Bollywood.

  I cannot give away the plot, but I want to say that SRK really brought his best to this film.  If you can watch this film without tears, you have no soul.

  There is one minor problem with the DVD itself.  The subtitles are about 3-5 seconds late.  Otherwise, this is a perfect movie.

The comedy is quite intact without being idiotically overheard. I'd recommend this film to anyone. There are people who dislike Shah Rukh Khan. Its a SRK film alright. Its him in every scene. As always his superhuman yet human self brings about spontaneity on screen. There are a couple of good songs that help in pushing the story forward.

Saif Ali Khan is good like he always is when playing an idiot in a big budget film. There's a great friendship which we get to see between him and SRK. What I loved about the film was that one very emotionally powerful scene towards the end of the film. SRK on his deathbed says something quite jolting to Saif Ali Khan. It killed me. I looked around to see a lot of people cry and I must admit it made me gulp.

What I disliked about the film? you can't see it more than twice and the second time around SRK's illness and energy combinations are exaggerated. Preity's good too. She looks great in this film especially in this one scene with SRK staring at her. I didn't like Jaya Bachchan's character cause it was a bit too real and well it bores to have her on screen. The kid without parents angle was another boredom inducer which is confusing really. Its basically trying to fit in too many plots into one. Dumb really.

The chemistry between Shahrukh,Preity and Saif is amazing;notably the chemistry between the two guys who each held their own and delivered excellent performance. Naina played by Preity Zinta lives in NYC with her mother, brother,sister, and grandmother in a house that is divided and separated by unspoken secrets and the constant bickering between mother and grandmother on how a family should be run. Naina tries to keep the peace and in doing that becomes a bitter young woman with no social life to speak of. The opening scenes are dull and sets the background of what life is before Aman Mathurs, played by SRK enters their town. With him comes colour and sunshine and catchy songs that have you on your feet and singing along(after you've watched it more than 3 times) He immediately cuts through the undercurrent that has been present in the movie and goes about interfering wherever he deems necessary. He immediately latches on to Naina's family and they become is project. He one by one solves each of their problems. the bond between him and Jaya Bachan who plays Naina's mother is instantaneous. I guess once you've played mother and son the bond is there forever. He states that everything he does is to see joy in a mothers eye. Naina hates the intrusion into her world and resents him from the beginning; an irritation she shares with her best friend Rohit played by Saif. however when introduced, Aman sees that even though they are best friends Rohit would not mind taking the relationship further and decides to hook them up. However nothing turns out as it should and Naina ends up falling in love with Aman who cannot return her love. What ensues is a story of the ultimate sacrifice of love. Knowing that he could not have her Aman made sure that Naina would be loved like she deserved. In between all the hijinks that he creates that inderlining secrets of the family comes to light and he manages to once again unite the broken home we see in the beginning of the movie. Being a big Shahrukh Khan fan i can unbiasedly say that this was one of his very best performances. The movie is definately a must see. I crosses every emotions out there and still manage to keep it's cohesiveness. In typical Bollywood fashion they manage to bring the bright colourful world of India to the Big Apple. The title song of the movie Kal Ho Na Ho sums it all up. Tommorrow is not promised, so live it to the fullest.",1110153600,4,2511,4.594654788418708
1982660,5,B00019HOU4,"This is one of the most fabulous movies i've ever seen!!!! Yash Chopra does it again in this sad, but comedic New York based movie starring Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta. If you're looking to see something that'll make you want to laugh, cry, sing or dance, then this is the movie to see.",1097971200,2,306,4.293103448275862

1982664,5,B00019HOU4,"(...)The movie is sentimental, but not terribly so. I actually felt for the characters instead of thinking of how cheesy the plot is. The acting, especially from Sharukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Preity Zinta, and Jaya is fantastic. The plot is a very serious, tragic one, but is speckled with lighthearted, intelligent humor. The score is amazing, and the songs are good as well, though in my opinion the latter could have been much better. The plot also deviates from the predictable Bollywood formulae that has cursed Indian movies of late, and introduces some new perspectives on life and love. Still, perhaps my most favorite thing about this movie was the amazing cinematography and professional overall look. Definately worth watching.",1081468800,,737,5.15

1. I almost never cry during movies and this movie made me cry a lot
2. The acting was sooooooo good
3. The songs were good

8008737,4,B00019HOU4,"Naina (Preity Zinta) and her family are at a low point in their collective lives until Aman (Shah Rukh Khan) moves next door and brings laughter back into their home.  Naina falls in love with Aman, who reveals that he is married.  Aman, knowing that Naina's best friend Rohit (Saif Ali Khan) is in love with her, tries to spark a romance between the two.  What they don't know, though, is that Aman is hiding an even deeper secret.

This romantic drama has a wonderful, moving plot.  All three main actors give convincing performances, and the supporting cast (down to the children) are impressive as well.  The musical numbers are beautiful, sometimes memorably so, with the exception of the mostly vulgar Club Nirvana scene, which keeps this movie from being five stars.  Overall, this tear-jerker delivers excellent entertainment and is well worth the three hours spent viewing.",1524787200,,882,4.959183673469388

8008742,5,B00019HOU4,"One of my favourite movies of all time. A beautiful love triangle, an inter-generational story, and an extravaganza of a movie that is simply in a league of its own. The downside: the minor characters are much less complex and interesting than the main ones, and the subplots are slightly melodramatic. The upside: funny jokes, warm-hearted humour and storytelling, some great songs with lavish dancing and costumes, riveting twists and turns, and a great, satisfying conclusion. Fantastic, and will leave you breathless.",1507075200,,521,5.365853658536586
