2283931,5,B0009ESTDW,"It has been quite some time since I have had the pleasure to see such a fantastic Sci Fi - Thriller. The story is smart and engaging, the film is incredibly detailed and stylistically mindblowing. It has been incredibly photographed and superbly edited. The actors are great as well. The soundtrack is pulse-pounding and atmospheric. So, I guess most of the professional reviewers who give this movie bad grades obviously have quite strange ideas what makes a film great and what doesn't, as far as I'm concerned I couldn't be happier with how Oblivion turned out. Great imagery is not contrary to good storytelling, in fact good movies tell aspects of the story through their visuals as is the case with Oblivion. I believe Joseph Kosinski is definitely the most interesting and talented director starting his career in the last few years for sure. I give this film my highest recommendation, and I am really diappointed that even a piece of work and art such as this mostly gets bashed by people who would probably never come up with anything like it themselves...",1365897600,31,1066,4.830601092896175
2283932,3,B0009ESTDW,"the graphics are great, set up for a what I figured to be a fantastic sci fi thriller, however the plot is poorly written and slow.  The trailer shows it too be nothing like it really is, kind of like one of those movies where they show you all the best parts of a movie in a 3 minute trailer.

I would say cruise does a descent job with it but as i said poorly written and maybe poorly directed even?
they set you up to think the ending will really shock you or something but it's not even close to what I think they were expecting.

There is really not enough contact with the humans on the planet and more trying to impress people with CGI graphics.

The ending was not super bad but also very predictable.

I won't be buying this one that's for sure....",1365811200,8,757,4.122448979591836
2283933,4,B0009ESTDW,"Being one of my highly anticipated movies of 2013, I was fortunate enough to get to see this movie early. And it very much  exceeded my expectations. Tom Cruise while, he is a good actor, really disappointed me with the 2012 movie Jack Reacher. But in this particular review, I am here to tell you that Oblivion is a re vamp for Tom Cruise.  This is a great science fiction movie. I will not spoil anything. Supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko (She is beautiful) and Andrea Riseborough; and they all did a outstanding job. I was mainly impressed how fast paced Oblivion was, and how i was still able to enjoy the movie. The visuals/effects were very well done in the movie as well. The storyline is predictable at some points but its nothing MAJOR to worry about. Other than the somewhat predictable parts of the storyline, I can find really nothing else to complain about. Oblivion is one of the best Sci Fi films of 2013. More importantly, it is a movie that i think anyone can enjoy.

4.5 stars",1365811200,13,1017,4.546448087431694
2283934,4,B0009ESTDW,"In the year 2077 Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are a working couple who live in a tower on the planet earth. We are given the background: Aliens called Scavengers or ""Scavs"" destroyed the moon. The earth went into turmoil. We managed to defeat them through the use of nuclear weapons. With our planet uninhabitable, our people went to live on Titan. An orbiting triangle space station gives orders to Jack whose mission is to maintain an army of drones used to hunt the remnants of the scavengers.

Jack's memory was erased in case aliens capture him. He has dreams of a woman (Olga Kurylenko)in NYC from a time long before the invasion. About the time Morgan Freeman shows up, things tie together, we get the twist, and the film takes off in a different direction.

The characters in the film are dry. The dialouge was boring. The action moved slow with the film definitely being too long. I enjoyed the one early scene where Cruise attempts a ""Mission Impossible"" type of escape, one that fails. The cinematography was great with a decent story line. If you love science fiction and are tired of those SyFy films, this is a welcomed change with neat killer drones and landscapes.

I am sure Cruise didn't have to beat himself up too much to accept the role of Luke Skywalker, Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith, Independence), and Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis, Armageddon) all wrapped into one as he saves the world from alien invaders. This film is an obvious Scientology film just like ""Battlefield Earth"". Tom Cruise believes, according to ""Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief"" that he will actually save the planet from alien invaders. Gotta love it.

Parental Guide: One f-bombs (1 SOB) no sex, no real nudity. Brief sensuality. Brief Riseborough buttocks (?).",1365811200,,1810,4.866883116883117

2283969,4,B0009ESTDW,"With varying degree, I enjoy most Tom cruise films. I know I'm in for a charismatic performance and a large production budget so I usually tag in to see how good Hollywood can be.

This film has some solid sci-fi ingredients: set in the future, man vs. aliens, human cloning (mild spoiler alert), dystopian earth, robots, etc. and it's all very slick but very quiet as earth is shown as a functioning earth. The setting and look of the film are cool enough to carry most viewers through act one with ease. Act II leads to the unveiling of act III that's loaded with enough Twilight Zoneish irony to create a mild eye roll.

Hollywood loves irony. Whereas I like it. But I really like villains as I believe they can make or break a story. Jaws, Alien, Star Wars - the villain drives the bus (even the film's title) and gives the story impact. Note: only one of those three films contains any irony.  You never really get a sense of a villain in this story until act III when all of the irony cards are played so viewers get to have that a-ha moment - ala most episodes of The Twilight Zone.",1524355200,,1089,4.328431372549019

2284045,5,B0009ESTDW,"I am constantly saying to others that I don't like Tom Cruise ""the person"", but they could give this guy an empty box and a stick and he could make it an interesting movie.  Oblivion is not the favorite type of movie for me, but with that being said, this movie allows us to take a peek behind the curtain of reality and the future, or at least the future how a certain segment of our population believes (basically the movie industry).

Once we get past the underlying political statement being made about what happens when everything goes wrong, this is actually a well done movie with a pretty awesome ending.  Cruise, as he does whether it's in Mission Impossible, Top Gun, Edge of Tomorrow or Jack Reacher, takes what in many ways would be an average movie and moves it up several notches.  I was wavering somewhere between 4 and 5 stars and what pushed my rating to 5 stars was the 4K Ultra HD HDR rendition of this release which was just a prime example of why people should upgrade their systems to 4K.....one word.....""awesome!""",1518912000,2,1037,4.529411764705882

The film incorporates beautiful visuals and relates a tale of both profound, cosmic sadness and hope that allows humanity's best aspects to shine through. Always I remind myself that Tom Cruise may have gone totally wonko, but that doesn't mean his movies aren't still good. And pretty much anything with Morgan Freeman has to be restaurant quality.

2284201,3,B0009ESTDW,"Ok, the action sequences took way too much of this movie.  They were what weve come to expect from this type of film, neither less, nor more preposterous than those in the MI series.  The shame of it is that theres an interesting storyline in this movie that could have been expounded on had it not been for the directors tendency to bleed every second out of the ridiculous encounters between Cruise and either the drones or the Scavs.  The storyline is quite complicated and would require at least a second viewing - and probably more - in order to be fully comprehended.

I won't be watching it again, though.  There are simply too many of the action sequences that would have to be suffered through again and I don't feel like punishing myself in that manner.  What once caused me to marvel at how they're able to manufacture the special effects now has me yawning and wanting to get back to the underlying story.

2284246,5,B0009ESTDW,"I came across this movie while channel surfing. The little I saw piqued my interest enough to prompt me to want to see the full movie. I checked out the DVD version through the local city library system. Watching it prompted me to buy the Blu Ray version. And now, for the movie. A number of one-line descriptions I've seen that are meant to give potential viewers a basic idea of what the movie is about are inaccurate. There's a whole lot more to it than that. It is a ""layered"" production.  By that, I mean that seeing the movie for the first time lets the viewer pick up on the basic plot. Yet, most viewers will likely not pick up on numerous instances in the movie providing pieces key to a deeper understanding for what is really going on with plot and characters.  Further viewings will be revealing to most viewers, giving a lot of ""ah-has!""  The visual imagery is dazzling (well worth a blu-ray), and the soundtrack will give your audio system a workout, no matter what audio format is used. The blu ray disc also has a number of informational clips on how the movie was made, which are valuable and interesting. That regarding the making of the movie (conception, production, direction, plot philosophy, etc) was illuminating, and if a viewer is having trouble figuring out certain aspects of what is going on within the movie, watching that clip will help to gain a complete understanding (as will listening to the director and actor commentary during the movie) of what is really going on.  As other reviewers have noted, it's not a perfect sci-fi movie.  At the same time, I think it has a lot to offer, and I recommend it without hesitation.",1507766400,,1656,4.581081081081081

2284301,5,B0009ESTDW,"State of the art houses high in the clouds, desolate and emotive barren landscapes and a post-apocalyptic movie with future tech about clashing realities and the nature of memory. Very much a meta sci-fi offering and perhaps one of the very best in post cgi cinema revolution of its type.

The mix of the three main story leads in their character roles is superb ( Cruises character comes across great throughout) as is the stellar Spanish voice track and subs also I find.

Oblivion starts great with a snappy montage type intro explaining the techs (Jack Harper) pov, after which it maintains the intriguing dramatic tone as the story builds. Quite a number of scenes have a vignette advert quality about them, like the top dinner table and swim pool dream, with elements of a grand deodorant advert about it and by and largely they are seamlessly stitched together in the films narrative.

Slight spoilers: To the above, I found the films intriguing tone got broken abit in the above stylistic way from Jack and Julie arriving to the log house into the following drone shoot outs with some slight clich&eacute; injected into events, while still being good.

However then theres a cinematic bolt of lightning when the film dwells on Kurylenkos hero character and the romance with Cruises character abit and the film just goes up another level (also using its best music moments) in just summing up a profound type of notion at the heart of the movies emotion  alien abduction and character connection, whatever anyhow it goes someplace else in its narrative. One of the most pristine dramatic sequences in films of Cruises I have seen (& cinematically generally) and creates a great set up for the culminating section of the films finales.
Its a great story overall in Oblivion, with quite a lot of coincidence to its memory construct of reality that despite its apparent conclusion, a sequel could be very interesting and just as good in a different way too I would guess. All the same, this is one of the top films for ambitious modern sci-fi cinema.",1504051200,3,2054,4.807365439093484

2284303,5,B0009ESTDW,"I'm not normally a Tom Cruise fan. This movie came to me because I am an M83 fan, and the music spoke to me long before I even knew about this film. On one hand, I can tell you how many movies he stars in, I enjoy. This might be my second favorite after Vanilla Sky. His performance is outstanding. Though there is action, I never felt like he was attempting to be an action star, which is a better role for him, especially as he ages. It is when emotion hits him that he is at his best. That was why I loved Vanilla Sky so much, and like the other film, the single, short cameo of another great actor helped bring out his performance at the climax.

I thought the film was going to have its problems. I really did. The plot started making me angry as we got into Act 3. Why did the writer have to make the decisions they did to bring about the ending of the story? I usually see endings coming, and I should have with this one. But the way that it was executed was masterful. I might even end up buying the blu-ray of this so I can watch it with commentary and all that good stuff in the near future.",1503705600,3,1101,4.004545454545455

  Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough
  Joseph Kosinski (Director)

  I think that most of the people who are bad mouthing this movie are doing so because they expect ALL ""sci-fi"" movies to be ""action"" movies. I think this movie, while it has a goodly amount of action, is primarily a thinking person's science fiction movie (as opposed to a ""sci-fi"" movie, which these days is nearly synonymous with fantasy). If you want to be spoon fed a lot of explosions, gunfights, high-tech gadgets and creepy-looking, murderous xenomorphs (i.e.aliens), then you will probably NOT enjoy this movie. However, if you don't mind paying attention to events as they unfold, and keeping track of said events from beginning to end, then you probably will enjoy this movie. I know that I thoroughly enjoyed it because it WASN'T your typical weakly-plotted, unscientific, action-oriented, ""sci-fi"" movie (think ANY of the Transformer movies). Is its science 100 percent accurate? No. But, it wasn't so GROSSLY inaccurate as to take me out of the plot, and make me ENTIRELY dismiss the premise of the movie. I found this film to be a welcome change of pace from most of the recent ""sci-fi"" movies, and I highly recommend it.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  2.39:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (35.9 Mbps)

  This movie features images that are very sharp, with great apparent depth, excellent shadow detail, and great contrast  and, they also possess a muted (and, sometimes, nearly monochromatic) color-palette that works very well with the tone of the source material. Fine detail is readily visible in all of the close-ups of faces, clothing, furnishings and machines  without any apparent edge-enhancement. Also, while there is some very mild banding on rare occasions (mainly, in the scene where Jack (Tom Cruise) uses his flashlight in the (now) subterranean library), there are no other anomalies to mar the image. Overall, this movie's picture quality is excellent  and, it should satisfy the VAST majority of viewers.

AUDIO:  DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (48 KHz, 24-bit)

  The sound quality and mix of the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack is nearly reference quality. This soundtrack has most of the things that you want, sound-wise, in a movie; namely: very intelligible and well placed dialog, very deep bass in the front, side, rear and subwoofer channels, fairly active and mostly directional sound effects in ALL (i.e.front, side and rear) channels, ambient and environmental sounds that are effective in communicating the location of the on-screen setting and action, and well recorded music (that is utilized effectively in the front AND surround channels). Overall, the sound presentation for this movie should satisfy all but the very pickiest of listeners.

Dude I have seen the movie EDGE OF TOMORROW. Have you seen it? don't waste time on this trash movie, go watch edge of tomorrow again if you've already seen it. that movie I've seen like 20 or 40 times. its just fun and funny. this movie is drama and I think it had one twist but if I recall it was like 3 hours and by the time you get there your like OK I guess that was worth it but maybe not.",1496620800,,704,3.9160839160839163

2284404,1,B0009ESTDW,"I bought this over a year ago, played it once and tried to give it away. No one wanted it.  I have not played it since. It is, to put it mildly, a bad movie. Universal has a habit of turning out dreadful films headed by a 'star' in which they are hoping to cash in on his name and care not about the quality of the film.  Then, just to keep us off guard, they actually make a super film; this is not one of those super films. Cruise has become a joke version of himself and only with an especially well written film has he got a chance. At the moment I am waiting for him to make a film with Charlize Theron in which she will literally mop the floor with him and mercilessly put him out of his misery. No, Tom, you are not Ron Hubbard; you are not even Tom Cruise any more.",1495584000,,773,3.8860759493670884

2284424,4,B0009ESTDW,"I love a film that surprises!  And this one does.  I can't believe I've never heard of it until now- especially with Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman starring.  This is not like your average science fiction movie.  Earth's moon has been devastated by an alien species and while humans have won the war, our planet has apparently been damaged beyond repair.  People have all been moved to Titan, a moon around Saturn.  Two people have been left on earth to oversee the last 'mop up' jobs remaining on earth and we get to witness the last two weeks of their jobs until they, too, will finally get to move from the earth to their new paradise on Titan.  Only... things take a very unusual turn that makes both question.. just about everything they know.  I loved the entire story line- I never saw the twist coming which was brilliantly done.  I felt the shock right along with the characters and rejoiced in the end.  The only problem I had was the shabbiness of the drones.  They seemed to be made out of the cheapest, lightest plastic.  They way they bounced around belied the fearsome reputation they had.  And watching people be afraid of them was a little funny.  The other thing that needed just a little more work was the identity of the alien force- what were they and why did they need all that water??  lol.  But all around, kudos for a great storyline.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Just up the budget a little next time for special effects, ok?",1493078400,3,1443,4.442748091603053

I think the Scabs could have been better..the story and plot to them..The look of them was great..the reasoning was good..but it just gave the story a split.and you didn't know where to go. I just think that could have been fleshed out a little different..but keep there look and purpose..This movie has a great soundtrack..and it is a work of art..you can see how Tron relates how this director thinks..when you see this.

Cruise seems to keep movies rolling with what is essentially the same character but in different, evolving situations.  Surprised that Morgan Freeman and Nicolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) roles weren't captured in greater depth.  Andrea Riseborough captures the role of his partner, Vica, brilliantly and Bond girl, Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace), plays Cruise's character's estranged wife.

2284499,5,B0009ESTDW,"Holy smokes. I was expecting to see a techy sci-fi film with some dumb plot point, but I was so absolutely stunned by the film. I was drawn in from the beginning due to the production design of the film and the lead characters, but I didn't realize just how much of a gem this film is. It's a cinematic achievement for 21st century film - I really don't know why the critics don't see it. Perhaps the film is a bit too deep and complex for some people? This is by far one of the most intelligent, well-thought-out, intricately designed films I have seen a LONG time. It's a beautiful film with its own share of tragic moments and joy-inducing sequences. TL:DR: This is the kind of film that you want to buy, not just rent. It's just simply beautiful. It's a must see. You will be moved.",1483488000,12,786,4.281879194630872

2284501,4,B0009ESTDW,Had to watch the Blu-ray and not 4k since the UHD disc IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE XBOX ONE S (500GB). According to the forums as of 1/3/2017 this issue has yet to be resolved from Microsoft. Shame since it seems like it would be a great movie in UHD. The movie itself is very good - excellent cinematography and special effects - very good story - so IMHO it's worthy of 4 stars.,1483401600,2,379,4.135135135135135

2284503,4,B0009ESTDW,"Please note I viewed this on a Samsung KS8000 series 55 SUHD TV through a Samsung UBD K8500 player. I am really only assessing the image as I have the TV wired into my stereo as opposed to a home theater.

To buy, or not to buy, that is the question  This is a solid 4k release, although it is not mind blowing or reference material. Probably worth $15 on eBay if you are a big fan of the movie.

The movie itself is a solid action/sci-fi mind-bender that doesn't fall into the typical patterns of traditional big-budget blockbusters, although it could be considered a bit of a rip-off of the underrated Duncan Jones classic 'Moon' from the decade earlier. The 4k UHD release features solid image detail, although it never reaches the 'wow' point. The colors are stronger than on the blu ray, although skin tones seem a bit overly pink. Additionally the color palette in the movie itself is fairly limited with stark landscapes and dreary underground bunker life so color enhancements for UHD have limited opportunities to realize their potential.

What it comes down to is whether or not the 4k UHD represents a significant upgrade over the blu ray. It is an improvement overall, but maybe not worth replacing your already excellent blu ray if you are not a huge fan of the film.",1483228800,2,1280,4.600877192982456

2284519,5,B0009ESTDW,"Tom Cruise is my boy... I like all of his movies, sorry. I grew up with Tom Cruise, the breakfast club, etc., So, I've been watching his movies forever.

Oblivion is a movie that can be watched over and over again. It tells a unique story of a possible future brought on by a war with another alien species.

For a time, this alien species is able to control what is left of the planet using clones (Jack Harper -Tech 49), and drones ( Drone 166 etc.,). However, over time, the clone (Jack Harper - Cruise) is beginning to remember things from the past. The more and more he remembers, the better and better the movie gets.

Great movie, I do not want to spoil it.. Morgan Freeman is not really a support actor, I think they used him for more publicity. I think Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, did a much better job that Mr. Freeman at creating a contrast between the Good and Bad in the movie.

Highly Recommended - Great Movie - Oblivion",1481328000,,930,4.358381502890174

2284568,3,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a somewhat confusing science fiction film featuring clones, drones, aliens and post-apocalyptic conspiracies. A romance has been thrown in, as well. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman star the main protagonists.

The plot is set on Earth after a devastating war between humans and aliens known as scavengers or scavs. Weirdly, the aliens are on the planet surface, while the humans live on a space station known as the Tet. The main hero, Jack (who works for Tet), discovers that his memories have been wiped out and that something is seriously wrong about the whole post-apocalyptic scenario. Supposedly radioactive zones turn out to be safe, clones of Jack and his co-pilot show up, and Jack's own wife (believed to be dead) is rescued from a mysterious space module. The mission recorder tells a shocking story which will make Jack question everything, including his very identity, and once again put the fate of humanity in the balance

It's not really a bad film, but the story (including the ending) is difficult to comprehend unless you're paying really good attention, or cheat by reading the Wikipedia entry. Well, the ending is actually incomprehensible anyway. Be that as it may, I will nevertheless give this post(?)apocalyptic fantasy the OK rating  three stars.

The actors are believable, set design is impeccable, costuming does not upset the immersion, technological assumptions and styling likewise fit the stylistic flow of the film.

It is a thin feeling movie in regards to the emotional bond an audience member might make with the characters. There is alot of convenience as well. I don't want to say ""contrivance."" I just think there's a bit too much convenience in the film. Especially noted by the monuments that happen to be visible (height and structural integrity taken into consideration) but especially significant with the empire state building.
stories are told because there's something about the events that are worth telling. Even a seemingly boring story is told because of the significance to the storyteller.

Still, I feel the experience is worth it to any science fiction fan looking for entertainment. Someone who is not easily offended by less-than-stellar science, plot, or character development, etc.",1474416000,,1102,5.082872928176796

2284812,5,B0009ESTDW,"A dystopian future where an alien race has destroyed Earth's moon and made war on the human race for possession of the planet. As a result, the human race used nuclear weapons to defeat the extra-terrestrial enemy but poisoned the planet in the process.

This is where we pick up the story. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is Tech-49 whose task is to keep drones in the air protecting the giant hydro-rigs that suck up seawater to make fusion reaction so the remainder of the human race in the ""Tet"", a giant orbiting spacestation, can move to Titan, Jupiter's largest moon to begin again. Then, out of nowhere, an ancient space shuttle lands with the woman that haunts Jack's dreams.

I was surprised by the numerous twists and turns in this film. The tech is cool, the special effects are very good as if the ravaged, desert landscape. The action sequences are excellent. Cruise does a fine job in his role as does Andrea Riseborough who plays ""Victoria"", Tech-49's communication link with the Tet and partner. Olga Kurylenko gives a wooden performance as the ""woman in his dreams"" but doesn't detract significantly from the overall production.

This is good sci-fi that will surprise you as the film progresses. I enjoyed this film immensely and I think most sci-fi fans will too. This is a first-rate movie, five stars.",1465689600,25,1316,4.788546255506608

Yes, the movie has some plot holes, but don't almost all fictional movies?  The acting is solid and beyond some of the gaps in the story line and similarity to other movies, it really sets forth the question of our existence and what makes us human.  It may never be recognized as one of the classics or greatest movies of all time, but it is definitely worth watching it its entirety (i.e., not on TV with commercial breaks) to gain a appreciation for the movie.",1465516800,,621,4.477876106194691

2284874,1,B0009ESTDW,"It's usually a waste of time to write negative reviews, but seeing as the film made me waste time with an empty promise here goes . . .

What a desperate film. This has all the surface gloss of a great SF film and some of the other ingredients, but somehow they don't all come together properly. The central mystery of the film is for the characters, all revolving around the Cruise axis, to prove they have character too (they don't), and hopefully come up with a story by the end of the film.

If you haven't fallen asleep, by the end of the film you will discover a decent story has finally emerged, but before that point you really want to stop the whole thing. Where Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a great film, this is not. Rise, has the surface glamour, but more importantly, it also has a good story, proper plot development, characters with credible depth, humour and action.

It would be all too easy to lay the blame on Cruise, but he's not bad in this film. (Morgan Freeman is bad. Gravel Voice doesn't equal Gravitas, it gets tiring seeing him typecast so formulaically.) The connections just aren't there. There was no connection between Cruise and his teammate, and when he discovers his dreammate, that too fails to convince. The one good relationship is between Victoria (teammate) and her boss - the feigned equanimity was done very well.",1460419200,,1359,4.538775510204082

2284876,5,B0009ESTDW,"Fantastic movie with stunning visuals. When I was a kid I dreamt and hoped movies would look and feel this good. The film has a very 70s sci fi feel and artistic direction to it (think Heavy Metal magazine)...which is my favorite type of sci fi look and atmosphere. The story and twist is pretty awesome as well and I have to admit Tom Cruise as well as Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, and Andrea Riseborough did a fantastic job at creating emotion and suspense. And last but not least...the amazingly unbelievable soundtrack by M83's Anthony Gonzalez teaming up with Joseph Trapanese (Tron Legacy Soundtrack). The end credits song...cleverly titled ""Oblivion"" is my fave off of the soundtrack. The song is very epic with a haunting but yet melancholic melody and provides an outstanding vocal performance by the talented Susanne Sundfr. Great visuals, great story, great twists, great acting, and great music = a spectacular epic sci fi extravaganza!",1459468800,5,951,5.025316455696203

2284895,3,B0009ESTDW,"Although the premise behind OBLIVION has potential the result is too flawed and derivative to have much of an impact. This is movie-making by the numbers, and its all too easy to guess whats about to happen from one scene to the next. And as a consequence of this, when the denouement arrives its rather ho-hum. Its also marred by a horribly portentous voiceover. But it looks impressive, and Cruise uses this obvious star-vehicle to reasonably good effect and performs well, as usual. This is SF the Hollywood blockbuster way, which means its heavy on visuals and action and light on story and character. But if you can accept it for what it is its not a terrible film and is more entertaining than it perhaps has a right to be.",1457827200,,729,4.572519083969466

2284914,5,B0009ESTDW,"One of the best Science Fiction films I've seen, with a solid script, acting, and plot.  Reminds me of ""Aliens"" in that it's a rock solid drama set in a Science Fiction landscape.  The visuals are fantastic, and the director is genuinely gifted in that he is the one who not only envisioned all the imagery, buildings, vehicles, etc, but actually sketched them onto paper years before the film project, and the sketches look exactly as what you see in the movie.  I watched this movie 'cold' having not seen the trailer or movie poster.  I think the box covers and movie posters showing Morgan Freeman spoil the plot.  There was a movie poster with Tom Cruz alone in front of a destroyed bridge, this should be the only image shown to future viewers of the film.

After watching the film, I then went online and was shocked to see the film was not properly recognized in the press.  Could be the Morgan Freeman poster or trailers spoiled the plot slightly for many folks.  This film is a bit like the ""Sixth Sense"" in that people should not know too much about the story before seeing the film.

Plot and acting aside (which were fantastic) Tom Cruise in true form is actually sitting on the cliffs seen in the film -- no special effects there.  (He also scaled one of the tallest buildings in the world for Mission Impossible, help only by ropes.)

In closing, saw this 'cold' without seeing a trailer or poster, and enjoyed it tremendously.",1456876800,,1442,4.550387596899225

By the end you'll have to question the whole premise. Other explanations of the circumstances could have been found and would not have precluded the premise of the movie. I won't spoil the plot for you, but let me just say that a science fiction writer was not employed in the making of this movie. Again, the film is enjoyable enough for a viewing, but in the end falls short of making sense, and finally paying off. We don't even get to see this war to which they refer. Also, the music is pathetic keyboard junk. Absolute garbage synth music. Why spend a hundred million dollars just to skimp on the music. You do know all the classical music ever made is in the public domain right? I think the music alone limits the number of views I can tolerate to: one.

2284917,5,B0009ESTDW,"Judging a film is a very tricky process because a lot of it is subjective. The only thing that can be commented upon is the craftsmanship and the craftsmanship of this film is masterful.

This is one sci-fi film that captures a very different tone than most others in the genre.
The story is built around and constantly evolves with the the characters (which you can count on one hand) so the film is really substantive.
The cinematography, the camera work, the stunts, the music, the CGI, all of these formal elements of filmmaking are handled with incredible skill and harmony.
Tom Cruise's performance and his dedication to do his own stunts is the defining characteristic of what makes this sci-fi story so enjoyable and personal. You are always in the middle of the action and can see the character engage in the action as if you were right next to him.

I love this film for being as imaginative as it is and for the amazing handling of the art form to make this story as enjoyable as it is.",1456617600,6,997,4.502762430939226

It is a throwback to the golden age of Sci Fi when writers worked with a blank page and took their imaginations boldly to new frontiers.  The lack of imagination in today's Sci Fi, where studios turn out the umpteenth Star Trek or Star Wars movie...is just sad.  Here is a movie that has a concise plot, does a good job of filling in the back story, presents pretty novel plot and comes to a pretty dramatic climax in a couple of hours.  It is practically a lost art to turn out one movie that achieves all that.  While I am certainly not a fan of Tom Cruise the person, he is a good actor and turns in a very good performance, as do the supporting cast members.",1456012800,,704,4.147058823529412

2284958,5,B0009ESTDW,"Awesome!!  You have to watch it more than once though.  If you have seen this film, you'll understand why I said that.  The second run through the movie was even better especially when listening to Vicka's lines and watching her interactions more closely.  The same goes with Morgan Freeman's character and what he says.  There are many levels to the film that you only get a sense for after watching it several times while focusing only on each of the characters individually.",1454630400,,477,4.7682926829268295

2284973,4,B0009ESTDW,"A surprisingly excellent movie, but the ending was very disappointing. After discovering the horrible truth about the alien's victory, the director creates a wonderful buildup to the conclusion. At the supreme moment, Tom and Morgan are getting ready to blow the alien's craft into atoms and rid the world of these interstellar parasites, when Sally tells Tom that she created him and that she is his God. Instead of Tom's character telling her ""to go to hell"" or even ""here's Johnny,"" he just says ""forget you Sally."" Surly, someone on the movie set must have mentioned how lame that response was. For me, it was a big let down, because I would have told Sally to stick it where the sun doesn't shine.",1453680000,,702,4.715447154471545

2284982,5,B0009ESTDW,"Though I'm not a fan of most Tom Cruise's movies, I made an exception and actually bought this one after a Netflix viewing. It's got a great plot with a nice twist at the end of the story, both of which prevent this flick from becoming just another Tom Cruise vehicle showcasing his chiseled good (?) looks. The cinematography is wonderful, full of dizzyingly airborne perspectives of the Earth's surface. The cameo appearance of a famous african-american actor (spoilers!) as a seeming villain who turns out to be a heroic, self-sacrificing figure works well (for once). The sci-fi technology is nicely done CGI imagery that's not too over the top. The story's premise is also believable: this eerie post-apocalyptic world is sparsely populated and its redeemers win the day in a plausible and convincing manner. All in all, this is a visually stunning and intellectually satisfying flick... even with Tom Terrific as the lead.",1453248000,2,928,5.032467532467533

Definitely worth a rental and a great addition to a movie collection especially if you're a post-apocalyptic or alien invasion genre fan. Or if you like Tom Cruise. The acting is simplistic, but it's a great plot with an interesting twist.

2285119,5,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is one my favorite science fiction movies.  The story is a unique and engaging tale of a few people fighting to save mankind from annihilation, with (of course) Tom Cruise in the pivotal lead role.  It has a small cast, each one of whom delivers a flawless, very convincing performance.  Location shooting in Iceland provides an incredible vista of stunning locations.  The use of special effects is seamless, though you know they're there when you're looking at places and vehicles that do not exist in today's world.

As the film unfolds, the main theme shifts toward emphasis on a romance involving Tom Cruise and another members of the cast.  (I'm trying to dance around spoilers here.)  Insightful human psychology and the intricacies of our personalities play a huge role in this film.  There's still enough high-speed action for enthusiasts for SF action movies, and not a single frame of it is pointless filler; no padded-out chases of unlikely vehicles or confusing battle scenes.  And not a single plot element that depends on the Hand of God or Pure Dumb Luck to rescue the hero from an impossible situation.  The good guys accomplish what they accomplish with their own ingenuity, foresight, and courage.

The voice-over commentary by Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski is nearly as much fun as the movie itself; do be sure to watch it along with the production extras.  You'll learn about how Kosinski's dedication to his story led to his friendship with Tom Cruise and the making of the film.

There's a little bit of gee-whiz alien super technology and the aliens' basic motivation is technically silly, but neither of those really bothers me while watching this film.  I'm a retired aerospace engineer, and most of what you see makes me think, ""Yup, given the time, a talented staff of engineers, and the budget to cover it all, I could built that.""",1442620800,,1879,4.886435331230284

I liked that too, but I would have given it 3-4 stars because most of the movie was slow going until the surprising things started happening in the last 30-45 minutes.  Still, we did talk about it afterward and later the next day, which is saying something. For most movies, there is not much to discuss afterward.",1441670400,,479,4.322222222222222
2285157,5,B0009ESTDW,"Understated, subtle, layered and elegant, this movie is a rare combination of mystery, action, sympathetic characters and lasting beauty. It's a post-apocalyptic movie that leaves you hopeful about humans. At the same time, it shows that some humans will always prefer the oblivion of fantasy to the reality of a hope you may have to struggle for.

I'm not sure, despite the outstanding visual beauty of this film, that the movie would have worked if the main characters, starting with Tom Cruise's character, hadn't been so immediately accessible with the appealing combination of vulnerability, strength, intelligence, and resourcefulness. Not to mention the authority and credibility that Morgan Freeman brought to his character.

Director, producer, etc.,  Joseph Kosinski, did a fabulous job of putting all the pieces together and making all the right choices, from cast to location and everything in between

This is that rarest of post-apocalyptic movies: rewatchable.

P.S. The commentary by Cruise and Kosinski was one of the better ones I've heard. It actually added depth and layers to the movie, guaranteeing a better viewing experience the second time around.",1441584000,,1172,5.417582417582418

2285198,5,B0009ESTDW,"So many remarkable coincidences in this movie and with my life as I wrote in my journal after watching it numerous times.

Character's name is Jack, so is mine.- Jack displays a most independent free will.

Jack's memory has been wiped clean, so has mine been drastically degraded due to a brain tumor causing numerous seizures.

Jack loves EARTH and its natural wonders - me, too!

He even loves playing music from old ancient record albums, and so do I.

Just prior to one of these record albums starting to play, I could hear an owl hooting in Jack's beloved natural setting. I so love owls! I heard one in Yosemite National Park just the other night.

When Jack wakes up at his gorgeous natural paradise-on-earth, a PEACE DOVE can be heard clearly. I love doves.

Jack has powerful dreams that he has a difficult time understanding. Don't we all?

Jack is a pilot as am I. Of course, I have never flown anything quite as sophisticated as that ship of Jack's!

Jack talks at the end of this movie about having a soul and the power of LOVE. I think of these powerful concepts all of the time.

The statements made in this movie about winning the war and contaminating the planet go right along with my fears.

He visits an old library that has been destroyed in the war, but there are still many old books in this library. Jack takes one when he leaves this library. He displays a love of libraries, and so do I love libraries which is where I am typing this from right now.

He saves a stuffed gorilla toy and takes it with him to his favorite Yosemite-like natural setting. I so love Yosemite and spend much time there currently. I have numerous very small stuffed animals in my tent which remind me of nature.

Morgan Freeman is wearing the exact same sun glasses that I wore when I backpacked the 230 mile long John Muir Trail many years ago. I have not seen these sun glasses since then.

There are many more coincidences that I will not bore you with at this time. It is a fascinating movie, and I would highly recommend it. I suggest that you see the Alex Jones review that he does of this movie via ""THE ALEX JONES SHOW."" I did a search on ""youtube.com"" and came up with that review. We so worship technology, and yet it can get us into so much trouble which I think is one of the underlying themes of this movie.

After helping to build 100 B-1B bombers for Rockwell International and the Military-Industrial-Corporate-Corrupt-Capitalist-Megamachine  (MICCCM), I know that this potential trouble that we create for humanity is REAL. When I tried to learn the destructive capability of each of these bombers carrying multiple-warhead hydrogen bombs in each of the three weapons bays, it was denied to me due to a ""NEED TO KNOW"" protocol. That was critical information that we ALL needed to know so we would wake up during the night after having ""OBLIVION-TYPE"" nightmares! Unfortunately, the only format in which we are allowed to know anything of true ""OBLIVION"" potential is via a fictional movie like this one and many others. May we all come to our PEACEFUL senses before this movie becomes non-fiction. In the NAME OF ""THE PRINCE OF PEACE""  I pray...

Thank you Amazon for making this avenue of communication available to us.",1439769600,,3240,4.576124567474048

But the plot and special effects and unique, original sci-fi zeitgeist of Oblivion is just remarkable and mesmerizing.  Not only this, but this movie is non-stop action, and you can never guess where it's going and what's going to happen next.  Just pure fun and intelligent, visual stimulating entertainment.  And it's even has an incredibly sensitive love story woven into its plot.  And yes the music is great, too.  Tom Cruise is at his best here, just like he is in Edge of Tomorrow and all his sci-fi films.  I've seen this film twice now.

2285209,3,B0009ESTDW,"Far into the future some man and woman are perched in the sky in some space age home. Their job is to fix robots that fly around these power plants that are sucking earth's water up to be used as energy in the mother ship somewhere near Saturn--where all the other humans are. The couple's job is almost done. And then they get to go to Saturn. Apparently there was a war with some creatures that destroyed the moon. So after the moon was destroyed earth was off its axis and natural disasters occurred altering earth and making it uninhabitable. But still under attack by these creatures man almost destroyed the planet by using nuclear weapons to defeat 98% of the creatures.

Sounds like a cool plot. But the problem wasn't in the beginning, middle or end. It was in the details. I cannot share those with you as it would ruin the movie for you but at some point in this movie there is a strange twist that makes sense at first. It is easy to get what has been happening, what is happening on earth/to earth. But then there is another twist involving the forbidden ""radiation zones"" that makes absolutely no sense to me. I mean, yes, I know why there were these forbidden zones, yes. But the other aspects of that. And the aspects of when this guy is approaching the mother ship--the switching back and forth from/to the space ships approaching the mother ship. I didn't get it. Maybe it is because the characters were always in a whisper. I dunno. Maybe I couldn't hear them even though I had the volume level at 35. Or maybe it just didn't make sense. But there is a huge hole in this movie that if I just shrugged it off I actually didn't miss anything to wrap up the movie with as the ending kinda made sense nonetheless. Anyway if you spent too much time thinking about it it would bug you in trying to piece it together. So I just didn't.",1439337600,,1847,4.369186046511628

2285257,5,B0009ESTDW,"It gets five stars for being a good sci-fi movie all around and 6 stars for plot twists. It also gets five stars for being orders of magnitude better than junk sci-fi like Interstellar. It gets 4 stars for story and dialog. In the end, when Sally says she is his God, Tom Cruise's character should respond, ""No Sally, you're the Devil!"". Instead he says, ""F-you, Sally"" which is crass, unimaginative and uncreative. What could have been a legendary movie line falls on the ear with a splat. The story suffers from insufficient background of the human survivor colony. The survivor colony is not properly set up for the amount it is used. There is a significant amount of participation from the colonists which begs for more information about them. Other than a bit about Morgan Freeman's character, everyone else is unknown. None of this detracts from this being an excellent sci-fi film.",1437177600,,888,4.810457516339869

The visuals were quite good. Whoever designed the world the characters inhabit did a good job. Sometimes the direction is such,
with the camera behind Cruise, that you feel that you are in a video game.

The story as I see it, is a story between good and evil; with evil and science on one side, and good (as love) on the other.

The sound effects blended with the score by MEighty-three are simply powerful; I got chills near the end once again. Some say the critics missed this one. I agree. It is my theory that, in this day and age, in a sci-fi epic where the world is destoryed, it must be blamed on ""Global Warming.""  And if we humans fought  a world-wide war against alien invaders with our own nuclear weapons, then all life on earth would be wiped out by radiation for eternity. Thankfully the film makers in this case refused to sucumb to such tiring ""Polictical Correctness."" Just ask yourself how in the world Elysium got four stars! Really,,,?

2285324,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a good movie it just takes awhile for the story to really get to where it's going.  I liked the post apolocaliptic take on the future.  The movie is really slow paced and will turn off a lot of mainstream action viewers used to more excitement.  Our society is filled with TV shows and movies with non stop action with little to no story development! The live action Transformers movies anyone.  So I applaud the director for taking the time to setup a riveting story.  Some of the visuals in the film are amazing and will stick with you after the film. I liked how ultimately Tom's character Jack learned to appreciate the little things that life had to offer, music, books a tranquil environment.  Which was the basis for the humanity inside to wakeup.

The film does have some nice twists and is predictable in the end, but I still found the movie worth watching.  In supporting parts I thought both Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldeu (aka Jamie Lannister) were very good.  Andrea Riseborougl seemed to be very robotic in the film but was easy on the eyes.  Tom Cruises character seemed pretty bright in the film but you would have thought he would have tried to capture a Scav similar to what Charlton Heston tried to do in the Original Omega Man to learn about them instead of just blasting them on sight.  He should have known something was up when the drones started shooting the escape pods.  I won't give anymore away than that.

You really get a sense of how desolate and isolated the world has become in the movie.  It reminded me of WALL-E in a strange way.  Olga Kurylenko did a nice job as Julia Jack's wife in the film trying to piece together his past a lot of the flashbacks slow down the film even further.  I thought the film was worth watching but it is definitely not for people with ADD or who want instant action all the way through.  I would steer those viewers towards Edge of Tomorrow another newer Tom Cruise Sci Fi movie instead.  This film deliberately goes at a slow pace.  If you don't have the patience for a movie with a slow beginning this is definitely not the movie for you.",1433289600,,2128,4.466321243523316

2285332,4,B0009ESTDW,"I have to say, this movie surprised me when I first saw it. That doesn't happen too often but I'm usually glad when it does because Hollywood can get something right once in a while. The story behind Oblivion started out as a comic book/graphic novel idea that was left to sit while the author(s) worked on other projects (if that's incorrect feel free to set me straight). If you're a sci-fi buff you'll notice a few homages to other works, but I felt this story stood on its own fairly well for the most part.

The visuals are spectacular; much of it was shot in the volcanic landscapes of Iceland. Having said that, I felt the score not only fit the movie perfectly, but was also quite possibly the best part of the film. It had both a retro feel to it but also sounded futuristic at the same time; like it was a classic 80s film that took place in the future. There's a couple twists that, for me, broke several SF clichs and didn't take too drastic a turn that would've damaged the pacing and plot.

My criticisms of Oblivion were relatively minor but I'll mention a few of them anyway: Things such as why wasn't Jack under closer supervision by the Tet or, since he's expendable, why allow him to override the drones' functions, or any of the technology for that matter? I also don't at all buy such a drastic effect from destroying the moon. There are others but there were very few WTF moments IMO, which is probably one of the main reasons this movie surprised me as much as it did.

I give this movie a solid 4 stars because I'm a fan of the genre and felt every element had something to praise. Oblivion is family friendly and isn't overlong like many films these days; why not give it a shot.",1432857600,,1704,4.335423197492163

Technically from an A/V persepective excellent audio, and video quality. Effects are well done. Music soundtrack well matched for the situation. Story is in the future after a calamity occurs on Earth. No spoilers here.

Tom Cruise saves the day by finding out truth of what is not what you would expect, or him for that matter. Key references made from the past help bind together his relationship to a key character. Near the end, you'll care too. It is difficult to describe without giving away too much.

This is a very good view. A must view borderline. Fun film in the genre.",1432425600,4,616,4.63302752293578

It would have been great if they would have toned it down a bit.  Much of the time, I felt as though I wanted to turn the sound of the special effects and music down a bit so I could actually hear what the actors were saying better.  The acting was good; the special effects were great.  The visuals in the movie were great.

The story was slow and not fleshed out.  There were characters brought in and then just dropped basically.  The story meandered a bit.

By the last quarter of the movie, though, it was all worth it.

I don't want to spoil it for you.  I will only say it's a 3 star movie for about 3/4 of it, and then it became a 4-star movie to me.  I'm glad I rented it.",1431820800,,838,3.9226190476190474

2285361,5,B0009ESTDW,"If you love sci-fi and great film productions, you can't miss this one. Cruise does a great job (as expected.) The scenes and the special effects meet or exceed expectations, too.
In some ways, e.g., the plot line, this story parallels the Matrix story. However, Morgan Freeman is no Laurence Fishburne. If Fishburne had not first brought us Morpheus, Freeman's Beech would have been a solid character. But, Morpheus already did set the standard, and Beech does not achieve it. Cruise, though, brings Jack #147 to life in a real way. Keanu Reeves' character Neo experienced a much greater transformation. But, Reeves' character is not felt, not presented, and not portrayed to the same artistic level as Cruise plays Mechanic #147.
You will enjoy it.

On the down side, however, although at first view the plot seemed plausible, retrospectively, the plot had many gaps.  Why use humans to extract earth's natural resources when the aliens' robots seemed to be sufficiently advanced to be able to do so?  Why did an oasis untouched by the aliens exist? Why should we believe that Julia could love one of Jack's clones to say nothing of two of his clones? On the whole, though, as with any good sci-fi, the movie left me wondering, ""Could this happen?  And if so, how might it happen?"" To me, good sci-fi always leaves me with something to think about.",1428883200,3,773,4.492857142857143

2285436,3,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a somewhat enjoyable combination of various sci-fi and post-apocalyptic dystopian future plot lines from across the media spectrum.  There are aspects of Fallout 3 (ex. the collection of assorted junk that is left behind, the bobblehead, and drone repair), Star Wars (the clone army), Star Trek (the Borg-esque AI), The Matrix (the imagery of a field of people growing inside the ""ship""), and the ""aliens"" look like the Predator.  There were some original plot twists that could have been exploited in a more interesting and/or an in-depth manner.  It would have been a solid 3 1/2 star movie if not for the ending.

****SPOILERS****
The ending was irritating and made me feel like the editor and/or studio just gave up.  For example, where did the daughter come from?  How is it that 52 was just as empathetic as 49 and had the same apparent lingering memories as 49?  Was 49 not that unique?  And the voice-over dialogue, who is asking if she sees him when she looks at the girl, the original Jack, 49, 52, or some other clone?",1428451200,,1041,4.712707182320442

I think this movie could've been so much more if it had been told from a different perspective, than the one chosen by the director.  I wish the story had gone into further detail about the war once the cat was out of the bag that critters the main character was blasting was actually humans.  You could watch this movie with your headphones listening to your favorite tunes because the dialog provides little value.  My opinion your mileage may differ.",1427155200,3,662,4.663793103448276

If you want to read a review of the film, do an internet search and see what critics have said. My opinion of the film: if you loved TRON: Legacy, then you'll feel right at home here since it's the same director. The film is visually beautiful, the music is great, and it can be thought-provoking. It doesn't really break new ground, but the twists and turns in the plot are fun and interesting, and the film plays on a lot of established scifi tropes, which may be good or bad depending on your personal preference.

The product is great, as it allows you to watch the film in any way you want- traditional DVD player, Blu-ray, digital copy. I haven't delved into any of the special features, but the film itself is crystal clear as it should be for a high-definition format.

Basically, you're only buying this movie if you liked the film in the first place. And if you did like it, you need to buy it in high-definition since that's the way it was filmed and the details that only HD can bring out make the film that much more enjoyable to watch.",1425945600,,1188,4.3954545454545455

 If you are a fan of other sci fi franchises like ""Star Trek"", ""Terminator"", ""Star Wars"", ""Aliens"", ""Conan"", ""2001"", ""Game of Thrones"", & others you might like this movie.

Cruise and his girlfriend live in this high in the sky house where they report to the aliens onboard the pyramid spaceship.

The future inhabited by the two main characters is bleak, the world appears to have been destroyed by an attempted alien invasion. There are feral human saboteurs that these two try to overcome in order to accomplish their mission, but not all is as it appears. Morgan Freeman gives a great performance, and Tom Cruise plays the science fiction hero as he does so well.

2285542,2,B0009ESTDW,"Such potential, and yet such large plot holes.  What's become of large SF movies lately?

For example, Transcendence was off to a great start, then jumped the rails and ended poorly.

Oblivion never gained traction as a story, Live Die Repeat was a violent joke of a film, and Lucy pulled up lame well before the finish line.

While Interstellar had its issues, it ended strong and is possibly the best SF movie of the last year.

I do want to mention The Europa Report and Gravity.

Gravity is the ""Speed"" of SF films (although it does have its positive points -- Gravity, that is, not Speed), while The Europa Report is one of those movies, like Pandorum, or Solaris, which grows on you over time.

When Tom Cruise finds another SF film as intelligent as Minority Report, or another role in a fantasy as rich as Legend, I'm all in.

Until then, I'm hoping he won't settle for any more films like Oblivion.

Honestly, I'd rather have a sequel to Knight And Day over this film.

This movie has dimension where most sci-fi action flicks lack. The plot is simple but very well told with great action along the way.

I felt the tension from Cruise's character with his redhead girlfriend who lived with him on the sky platform. The story unfolds nicely when he accidentally stumbles onto the ravager's hideout. From there the movie starts moving at a good pace leading up to revealing who or what is actually controlling the Terra-formers.

Olga Kurylenko as Julia Harper was in my view a mistake, albeit a very small one, and it did not ruin the experience or the film itself for me.

2285592,4,B0009ESTDW,"Given the polarisation of popular opinion voiced in previous reviews, we settled down to watch this movie on Christmas afternoon with open minds, hoping for the best but half expecting disappointment. I'm happy to say that the former sentiment definitely won the day.

Tom Cruise plays his usual monolithic self as a repair-man for drones protecting vast machines against marauding Scavenger survivors as the machines suck the planet dry to provide fusion energy for the last bastion of mankind on Titan following a war with `the Scavengers' which left the moon destroyed and the Earth ruined. Or at least that is what he thinks he's doing.

It is difficult to elaborate further on the gradually unveiled truth without spoilers but it isn't really that hard to second guess the plot if you have a decent grounding in science fiction; it is not complicated and there's nothing startlingly original in any of the individual themes or their treatment. The whole film does, however, merge this potpourri of standard sci-fi plot devices into a fairly coherent whole. There is much either blatant plagiarism from or reverential hat-tipping to (depending on your point of view) almost every science fiction film & TV series since the 1970's and there are some gaping plot holes (try to keep track of the elusive flight recorder from the Odyssey if you can) but there's plenty of really cool hardware to keep the interest of our inner teenager and some excellent 70's music.

The film is visually stunning; not in an obvious flash-bang way but more the product of careful and consistent design and as a consequence, the whole experience is immersive and neatly conceived. Yes, there are silly bits, plot holes, continuity oddities and, I suspect, deliberately corny bits of dialogue but that doesn't stop it being a creditable effort at producing something different in a totally oversaturated movie genre. As with most Cruise offerings, sit back, turn off those higher cognitive functions and enjoy the ride - it is really quite a good film (although the Blu-ray case is very silly).",1421539200,,2076,5.011594202898551
2285593,5,B0009ESTDW,"I waited many months until Oblivion was available to rent for under five dollars rather than buy.  The wait was worth it!  This is an amazing movie.  Oblivion and Edge of Tomorrow are two of the best movies that I have seen in years and both have Cruise as the lead actor.  Both movies are incredibly smart and unpredictable.  Obilivion is not like Cruise's flat War of the Worlds.  The nemesis is much more intelligent containing multiple smart hooks that surprise the viewer until the end.  Cruise does a great job acting and is one of the only aging a-listers that can still carry a great performance (unlike Brad Pitt, Mel Gibson, John Travolta, and others who seem to have grown complacent and big-headed). Oblivion is better than the preview indicates.  I thought that Morgan Freeman was going to end up being the bad guy, but the real enemy is surprising and complex.  The error of War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise (and other sci-fi movies) is that the nemesis doesn't have a personality and is too general in its scope, but in this movie it is very unique.  At only one point did I think the plot line started to meander when the clones started to arrive and I thought that movie would drift into weirdness, but then it made sense as the plot continued to unfold, and then made perfect sense at the end.  A sci-fi movie is best when it makes the fiction seem plausible and gives answers to questions at the end of the movie while keep the viewer trying to answer that question throughout the movie.  Cast: five stars, Plot: five stars, Cinematography: five stars, Love story: five stars.  The movie also contains a lot of hints at potential globalist plans for the future of America. I believe that movies are often used as predictive programming by the elite.  What does the blown up Super Bowl Stadium in 2017 mean?  What do all of the numbers mean?  In closing, I would definitely rent this movie, and could even buy.  So rare is it these days to find a movie that I would like to watch more than once.  Then, I would rent Edge of Tomorrow after it as both are excellent and both contain uber-fresh sci-fi plots lines that will keep you guessing until the end.",1421452800,,2172,4.497448979591836

2285603,4,B0009ESTDW,"You won't find much that's new in this movie if you're a dedicated sci-fi fan. Oblivion fairly raids everything from Silent Running and Planet of the Apes through Total Recall and all the way to more recent fare such as Moon. I think the movie would have turned out better if the director had chosen one or two themes from one or two of its influences and developed those themes more fully. As it is, Oblivion feels more like 5 unfinished movies rather than 1 finished movie.

The visual style is truly original and a refreshing change from most sci-fi over the last 20 years. The director comments that, after the original Alien premiered in 1979, sci-fi movies moved towards dark and shadowy visual styles. Oblivion sparkles with whites, off-whites, and grays--the box art on the DVD cover gives you a good sense of the movie's look. The problem is, the art design and production design don't communicate any kind of strong view or outlook. You always get the feeling in classics such as 2001 and Blade Runner that directors Kubrick and Scott have an interest in their characters and that they're using their sets and visuals to express a mood and a theme. Oblivion fails to communicate that same sense of purpose. Consequently, it leaves you cold.

The most memorable thing about this movie is its ""drones:"" sphere-shaped robots that fly around and decimate enemy targets with the firepower of small battleships. The drones look great, their flight patterns show great imagination on the part of the moviemakers, and the wide range of sound effects they produce is truly astounding.

As for the acting...Tom Cruise is beginning to look a little too old to be starring in sci-fi actioners. At the very least, he shouldn't be in the lead role. He does well here, but he isn't especially involved. Nor does he generate any real sympathy for the character he plays. Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough are both competent actresses, but they seem to have been chosen more for their fashion-model good looks rather than for their acting abilities. They're both striking visual presences but so are statues. Finally, Morgan Freeman looks very cool in his shades. However, he doesn't have much of a role so any Freeman fans will find this film to be disappointing.",1420934400,,2261,4.837209302325581

2285637,2,B0009ESTDW,"Let's see...OK this is another dystopian future movie with minimal character development and a predictable outcome but with some interesting twists.  THe gapping hole in the plot is only apparent at the end and leaves you wondering why? Why did this whole thing happen, Why does Tom Cruise's character even need to do what he does, Who is benefiting from this whole scenario?  I won't spoil the ending but let's just say there is no ""Darth Vader"" which is sort of required to be the target of our angst.  There are some major inconsistencies with the intelligence of the evil computers/villain.  ""HAL"" from 2001 was much more realistic in ""his"" response to threats.  The setting is mildly interesting but the story just does not have enough links to reality to elevate this movie above a light weight action movie.",1420329600,,814,4.827338129496403

2285651,4,B0009ESTDW,"""Oblivion"" manages to carve out a relatively original premise, which arrives near the end of the movie, and presents itself as a surprise, not unlike the surprise ending of ""Planet of the Apes"", although it creeps up on you over the last 20 minutes, with some thin clues showing up from the middle onward. With only two characters on screen for most of the movie, the dialogue is not scintillating, but then, that becomes part of the clue to the final reveal. In truth, from about 10 minutes in, you get that itch in the back of your mind which says, things are not what they seem. The problem is that what they seem is so unlike our normal world that we don't know what to make of that itch. It maybe the kind of itch which Kevin McCarthy felt when he returns to his home town, and some of his neighbors don't seem right.
There is a fair amount of ""quoting"" from similar ""survival films"" such as ""The Omega Man"" and ""I am Legend"". The similarity to those movies adds to the surprise, since the outcome is so different. The effects and scenery are ""clean"", since the moonlike landscape, filmed in Iceland, is all real. This may be what is often called a ""hard"" sci-fi tale, which, being also apocalyptic, will also appeal to a wide audience. I would rate it not quite as good as ""Elysium"" but better than ""Ender's Game"". I think the best recent film of this style was Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"".",1419724800,2,1396,4.45703125

After finally seeing it I'm perplexed by those accusations. I agree it's derivative, but no more than any other sci-fi film as of recent. Basically movie hipsters colluded together for some unknown reason to quash this movie, probably because it's cool to hate Tom Cruise. Their accusations are paradoxical anyway because the films they accuse Oblivion of being derivative of are themselves derivative of other movies.

It's a great film. It's nothing super profound or thought provoking. It has some plot holes, and it is derivative of other sci-fi films (like movie hipsters' favorite slideshow ""La Jetee""). However it's got fine acting, an entertaining plot, and fantastic special effects. I hate CGI but this film blends CGI seamlessly with practical effects.

2285697,3,B0009ESTDW,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Spaceballs, a sci-fi comedy, has nothing on this masterpiece. I could not stop laughing when the drones appeared, who came up with this visual, let alone the R2D2 sounds? The super high tech TeT Commander can't even get a decent transmission and was always on the 'fritz. I loved Melissa Leo, what a departure from her typical Southern sweetness, oh wait...

Tommy had me at ""Risky Business"" and his performance fell just as flat. Apologies, I know how hard you work at your craft. Maybe when you are 60 we can get a little more lateral motion.

Olga HotBabe is stunning with so many head shots of her emoting, er sleeping, and were beautiful. I am guessing she is the new Angelina, but no comparison on the acting level, she just seemed scared and uncomfortable during the film. Can hardly blame her sidling up to the Big Boys.

The scene that provided the highest entertainment value was the Scav Torture Chamber. Now, when you are desperate for a drone flyer and there is only ONE, what do you do? You smash him to bits, tie him up, flame the Draqnet bright lights on him and recite poetry, gots to end on a polite note. My friends, it doesn't get any better than this.

Enjoyed the Zep tune on the grassy knoll, and other musical inputs. However, the sound was so disjointed, i.e. dialog barely a whisper, action scenes cranked up 1000%, constantly had to adjust the volume, unclear if that was an editing problem.

I guess the crowning achievement is that our man hooks up with two major hotties, take that Katy!  Recommend for pure comedy, especially if you are a big sci-fi fan.",1417564800,,1627,4.570446735395189

2285719,2,B0009ESTDW,"You know, this is one time where a director can make or break a film.  Granted the material is nonsense to work with but the pacing is painful.  There are only so many plane takeoffs and landings that one can bear.
The plot, if there is one, is about alien invasion and how they devastated the landscape.  (You know, a species that can take down the moon -- which makes no sense either as the gravitational forces would put the moon back together rather quickly) should have no problem inserting a retro virus into the atmosphere and taking down all life on earth.
On top of that there are many planets and moons in our solar system that have huge bodies of water that don't require so much work.  Europa, a moon on Jupiter comes to mind but Mars has water, so does our own moon and so does Mercury and you don't have to fight off the indigenous population.

2285757,4,B0009ESTDW,"2013 brought in a sizable influx of science fiction movies, with many of them being quite good. This was the year of films like Gravity, Hunger Games: Catching Fire, World War Z, Elysium, Iron Man 3, Pacific Rim, Ender's Game, Riddick, Star Trek: Into Darkness and several more. Quite a haul for sci-fi fans. Oblivion was part of this pack, and conceptually it did stand out. The movie is visually stunning with some creative slants on the post apocalyptic sci-fi genre. However it does lack at extra magic you get from a truly great film. Still even with this limitation it is a very worthwhile experience.

The plot starts off in 2077, 60 years after an alien attack cracked the moon like an egg (and subsequently sent Earth into climate chaos). Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a technician assigned to fix and maintain robotic drones used to protect massive fusion generators powering a massive spaceship set to take the surviving humans to a colony on Titan. Harper is told there are still aliens, called Scavs (or scavengers), that wish to sabotage their exodus. This is how the story starts, but it really moves into new territory from there.

One of the bigger problems this movie had was how it was promoted. A lot of spoiler info that was better left for the audience to experience on their own was practically given away on the promotional trailers for the film. This is a serious lapse in judgment, as it significantly lowered the impact of one of the biggest plot twists in the film. Thus undermining the main draw to watch it. Granted there are other plot twists that thankfully Universal didn't give away, but I believe the damage was done. It may very well have had a hand in reducing ticket sales. I usually avoid as much as I can putting any spoilers on a review, and in spite of the boondoggle already burdened on this film I will still do my best not to ruin this film for you.

Oblivion is based on a conceptual story created by Arvid Nelson and director Joseph Kosinski that was planned to be a graphic novel, but never was made. The story back then was already intended to be feature film, so all the work done for the never-published comic was used to pitch the film. The story itself got a lot of people excited from pre-production onward, and I can see why. There is this mix of environments with Jack living in a sterile and modern environment that affords lavish comforts and high technology, and then you have the fallen Earth (Manhattan to be precise) that looks so barren and alien with a few instances of the old city jutting up from the dirt or entombed in it. The story gives you a run of the mill day for Jack (a great exposition device for establishing the setting) and then slowly unravels what you think is going on into something quite the opposite. When left to its own devices this is some really good storytelling.

The real gem of this film is the imagery. The aforementioned ""fallen Earth"" is quite a site to see. Imagine Manhattan swallowed up in what seems like centuries of soil piling on top. The flyby scenes where you get an expansive view of the surroundings are gorgeous. The lighting and time of day give a wonderfully soft overcast, making it all look that much more deserted. All the high tech stuff looks really sleek as well as functional. From Jacks Bubble Ship to his high rise (I mean really high) dwellings all show some innovation in design that you only see in conceptual drawings, but hardly ever come up in a live action film. Weapons are cool looking. The drones are very cool looking (even if they have a convenient Achilles heel). Being a fan of sci-fi tech I really appreciate the attention to detail. All in all there isn't a single scene in this film that doesn't deserve some amount of praise for how well it was presented.

The problems start after the plot twists have been established and you are left with what to do about it all. That's where the movie loses much of the wonder it was establishing in lieu of moving the plot forward. I can't help but think more thought should have been put into the third act as it feels like a different movie. Where the previous acts were fascinating and had an air of mystery now we fall into common trappings seen on many other sci-fi movies. It's not necessarily bad, and it doesn't ruin the film for me. It just doesn't measure up to the potential of what could have been.

There are reviewers who have pointed out several ""plot holes""  in Oblivion, but I would like to set the record straight. A lot of these plot holes are more about the viewer's short sightedness on what's going on than actual limitations on the writing and directing. Suffice it to say there is more to finding a ""hole"" than just calling out something that doesn't make sense. You have to expand your line of thinking beyond why you don't think it makes sense and look for reasons how they can. I can't go into details, as doing so would bring out spoilers, but lets just say this movie is nowhere near the swiss cheese of logic many make it out to be.

This is the best release to date as far as viewing options are concerned. You get the Blu-Ray, the DVD and codes for a digital download. Visually the blu-ray is reference level material. It looks absolutely perfect in 1080p MPEG-4 AVC format. It helps that the movie was filmed in 4K mastered in 2K resolution. The audio is English DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 and sounds about as good as it looks. There is also Spanish and French dubs at DTS 5.1 (subtitles too). The extras are funny in that the packaging is misleading on how much is in there, but what little you get is actually the benchmark for what a good listing of extras should have. Here is the breakdown:

Promise of a New World: The Making of Oblivion - This is a 48 minute documentary that is broken into five parts. Destiny talks about the on location shots, physical sets and story development. Voyage is all about that cool bubble ship in the movie. Combat is on the stunts and action scenes. Illusion is the visual and computer generated image effects. Harmony is about the music score. All of these sections combine to make a pretty comprehensive behind the scenes look at the movie with very little promotional fluff.

Commentary - Both director/writer Joseph Kosinski and Tom Cruise provide the commentary. While the movie was Kosinski's baby Cruise had a fair amount of input in conceptual design. The two kind of lay on thick the praise they have for Oblivion, but I suppose you can't blame then as you can tell this was a labor of love. In spite of those distractions the commentary is actually quite informative and makes for a fascinating view into how the movie was made.

Deleted Scenes - These are four very short scenes, but man are they good. ""Bubbleship Flyby"" is less than a minute but it's a great view of the flying vehicle and shows a little extra something you didn't know about the platform they live on. ""Stadium: The Original Opening"" is a minute and a half and is a must as it explains a little bit about the drone's weak spot. ""Medkit"" is also around a minute and a half and expands slightly the medical technology on Oblivion and is kind of a decent character development scene. ""The Archives"" is less than a minute and has a tiny bit of character development. Some I can see where taken out due to redundancy (medkit was seen in a later scene and such), but it's a shame some interesting details were left out of the movie.

M83 Isolated Score - You get the full film score in uncompressed 24bit/96kHz Dolby TrueHD 5.1 for your listening pleasure.

Digital Copy via Ultraviolet  - Great to have it, but it's another one of those stupid offers that has an expiration date on it. If you wait too long to get this disk you may not be able to get the digital copy. Why the dummies stick with this kind of restriction is beyond my understanding. They are pretty much pushing you to download a torrent or some other download with this kind of attitude.

Oblivion is a worthwhile movie with lots of great things to see and experience. It's a good movie, but not a great one. Good enough to say if you are a science fiction fan this should be required viewing. If you are Tom Cruise fan I would say this is also required for you as well. Popcorn movie fans I think will also find something to enjoy here as well. If you can get by on the limitations discussed you are in for a treat.",1415836800,3,8402,4.489528795811518

I'm not going to try to argue with the naysayers because that pretty hard, all I am going to say is that I personally enjoyed it. It gave me a sense of nostalgia in that it has some sort of indistinct feeling that I've sorta seen it before, and I don't mean that in a bad way, I mean it in a good way.

This movie moves along at a quick pace and when Jack Harper rescues an unknown woman who crashed on Earth his world begins to unravel.  Everything he had been told may be a lie as he attempts to deal with reality.  I never like to give away every detail because it spoils it for the movie viewer.

A mishmash of tired old action flicks.  Son Cruise is Fathered by Freeman and babied by Sister with eye pupils larger than imagining.  Movies are shot with tons of light;  how did this girl get her pupils so huge and the same shot to shot?
And bless ole Tom, he gets to have the now-signature cut across his nose.

Ok, this movie stands out by solving the age old dramatic problem of how can the hero have TWO women in one film?  The James Bonds solve that by killing of one or two and allowing another to kiss at the end.  But, this film just has TWO CRUISES !  One Cruise gets to die heroically with the big pupils girl and the second one gets the blandly somewhat Asian ""hottie.""  When the two Cruises meet, does either say, ""Hey, you are me!""  Nope, just take to fist fighting.  No one has a gun when they really need it.  Then Cruise #2 chokes out #1 and the choke lasts a very long time, long enuf to get tied up with a towel and lay in the dirt still comatose.  Hint, in a 'choke out' the loser either dies or wakes up in a minute after.

2285915,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi treatment of an incomplete and unpublished graphic novel of the same name by Joseph Kosinski and Arvin Nelson. Kosinski's creations are familiar to me from many hours of playing Halo. Elements of his previous treatment of space landscapes, drones, machine voices from the game are recast into the movie and if you readers know what I'm talking about, I hope you will tend to agree slightly with me.

The proposition of the story is interesting. Set in March 2077 in a surreal post nuclear setting with the remnants of distant cities poking through the wilderness, the movie begins with a lie, a mistaken narration from a brainwashed yet wavering Jack Harper, the movie's protagonist.

According to him, humans are refugees from a consuming but successful nuclear war with an alien race from space called Scavengers (Scavs). They first destroyed earth's moon and then invaded earth. The nuclear campaign that followed however left many areas of earth uninhabitable. The survivors we're told launched off in a temporary space station called Tet and while in an effort to colonize Titan, Saturn's largest moon, Harper thinks he and his partner ""Vica"" are assigned to be last two ""mop up crew"" on earth to oversee the drone surveillance of Hydrorigs. With visually treating scenes, we learn that Hydrorigs are humungous energy stations constructed in the midst of oceans churning sea water somehow to fusion energy. This energy is apparently a crucial ingredient for humans to colonize Titan so protecting that is their mission.

In the movie, Harper we learn is an armed drone repairman. Victoria or ""Vica"" stays back in their futuristic home base acting as his communication officer. She also liaises with the suspicious character of Sally, who sits in Tet's Command and hands down mission tasks. Together they direct Jack across the vast topology of wastelands to rehabilitate downed drones with new parts. The root issue for repair is that drones are shot down by the apparent remnants of Scavs who have not hesitated to launch a last stand against their human victors. The belief that Scavs are responsible for this guerilla warfare is vanquished some thirly minutes into the movie.

This movie makes several attempts at throwing in that human touch generously. Harper we see exhibits a dichotomy of character which is the crucial element of the movie.  He is shown appearing shell shocked, nearly faltering with the bits and pieces of his past memories - his wife, baseball games he used to watch, the very basis of his mission... He exhibits frustration that as the war winners, humans were now left to find a new home on Titan.

On the other hand, he doesn't appear too convinced that Scavs are in a dire need to kill him, could they perhaps want something more by capturing him alive? Vica plays the role of reassuring him that their mission will soon end and they will get to fly back to Tet. In perhaps the only sexually themed scene of the whole movie, we see her trying to recapture him into the present as she slips into their swimming pool naked, pulling him with her. However his wavering of belief persists. He is shown taking refuge occasionally at his getaway, a still standing cottage house in a surprisingly well preserved meadow. It is intact with a lake, and the house stocked with select memorabilia that allows him to drift off to a past he remembers.

The first strong twist in the movie appears when he spots a curious space module hurtling towards earth. Immediately flying to the wreckage site, he notices people strewn all over in distinct enclosures called sleep pods with the words Odyssey written on them. He believes this module had been sent from the big ship Tet and the people lying on the ground were survivors from an accident. Something about Odyssey tugs at his memory but at this phase of the movie, we're not sure how its all connected. Suddenly, a drone appears and violently shoots the sleep pods down, one by one. Furious, Jack screams away at it preventing it from shooting the last pod containing a woman he seems to recognize. Well , who is she?

He takes this woman, Julia back to the base and together with Vica, tries to rehabilitate her from her ""Delta sleep"", a protective state of hibernation. The scenes that follow confuse but keep the suspense. Julia wakes up. They fill her on what happened. When Jack narrates their mission on earth, Julia is seen smirking. In private, Vica and Jack argue on the origins of the ship Julia came in. Jack exchanges doubt about the whole incident and wonders if Vica has any memories of Julia from the past. In another beautifully filmed scene set during sunset, Julia insists she has to get back to the wreckage of the ship to secure the flight recorder.

In a pre-dawn trip back to the wreckage, Julia and Jack successfully find the flight recorder but in a timely yet remarkably ungory fashion, a ""scav"" attacks them taking them captive. Back at a secret base, a bound Jack Harper wakes up on a chair to meet a new stranger, Malcolm Beech who doesn't hesitate to blow everything Jack believed about his world.

Beech reveals the people Jack were now facing were not aliens, they were humans and it is infact the Tet that won the war and subordinated humans to suck earth dry of its resources. He reveals his entourage of unmasked Sergeants led by the hunky Sargeant Sykes who sticks to his theory that Beech was a fool for bringing Harper there. Beech challenges Jack to prove Sykes wrong.

Taking Jack aside, Beech reveals the full breadth and scope of their mission : to acquire plutonium grade nukes, stick them in a captured drone he had at his disposal and launch it into the Tet to destroy it. Jack would fill in the gap by programming the drone to accept this new mission. Looking to establish his honesty, Beech lets Jack and Julia go back and take a look for themselves into the radiation zones where they were always instructed not to go according to Tet's Mission Command.

This gives an opportunity for a shaken Jack to question Julia - ""who are you, what was your mission on Oblivion?"" This is the moment of clarity for Jack, who learns that Julia is his wife and the alien ship is actually Tet. What Beech seemed to indicate and what Julia was now telling him co-related. So what was going on?

This also sets the stage for friction between Julia and Jack, Julia who saw them share these intimate moments though her remote camera.  She is emotional and furious at Jack who shows up with Julia at the home base. She declines to open the door for them, and reports to Mission that her partner has suddenly lost all ability to perform as an ""effective team"". Soon, chaos ensues. Mission Command effectively launches a drone internal to the home base. It targets Julia, perhaps with evil intent and kills her. Sally from Mission Command nonchalantly apologizes to Jack for this lapse in judgment and asks Jack and Julia to come back up to Tet for a new debriefing of their mission. This arouses Jack's suspicions and is another crucial element of the movie...

The duo quickly escape the home base and after a dog fight with three drones, find themselves crash landing in the ""forbidden"" radiation zone. Another shocker awaits Jack, who finds a replica of himself repairing a downed droned a few yards off from their crashed location. This sets stage for a fight between the two. The replica is killed. Julia is injured in the fight as she takes a bullet to her stomach. Jack rests her body in a secure cave and flies back to the home base for medications. There, he meets a second instance of Julia, who he supposed was dead. He realizes the indications this is giving. Beech was trying to tell him something after all.

Jack goes back for Julia and revives her. In another intimate conversation at the cottage house, Jack tells her he believes he's not the real one she loves yet he somehow remembers everything. Nevertheless, she fills him on the things he said when they got married. They would grow old and fat and die together and no one would remember them. These memories were his, they were theirs... Jack is dazed but succumbs to the reality.

Nest morning, Jack shows interest at returning back to Beech and his crew. Beech is happy to receive them. In a subsequent scene, Beech narrates the whole history of the war once again which convinces Jack he's just a replica of thousands of instances like him created by Tet to oversee the plunder of earth's resources. Phase 2 was drone, programmed with the fire power necessary to survey and kill humans and Jack was only a pawn used by Tet to oversee the operation.

Jack, convinced of the entire lie he were forced to live, programs the drone that Beech had captured and inserts the plutonium nuke into it. In a strong attempt to eliminate this group of humans, the Mission Command, aware of what's going on, sends drones to invade Beech's property. In the bath of war in which all the drones are eliminated, an injured Beech convinces Jack that it's time launch their drone into the Tet. Weary from war, Julia shows her eternal love and convinces Jack to let her go on a kamikaze mission with the drone to destroy Tet. Jack, seemingly agreeing in the scene, packs her into the pod as if getting her ready for it.

Surprises come soon. The final scenes show Jack and his ""human"" cargo flying into space on this mission to Tet. While on this journey, Jack manages to play back the flight recorder from Odyssey which confirms that in the past, Jack and Vica were commanders on a research flight to inspect an unidentified object in the sky. This object would be Tet, and in a last ditch effort to preserve a survivor, Jack had released a module of the Odyssey back to earth which contained Julia in her Delta sleep. As this realization dawns on him, Jack's ship enters a gaping hole in the Tet and is shaken to see hundreds of his replicas neatly preserved in chambers on the walls of this chasm.

They are greeted by ""Sally"" who assumes the voice of a curiously shaped massive object in the middle of a chasm of space within Tet. Tricking Sally into believing that the cargo contains Julia, Jack open the pod to show Beech who we learn had chosen himself to die on this mission instead of Julia. Sally is furious and proclaims she is Jack's God and his creator and that she cannot be cheated. A determined Jack recites a verse by Horatius

""How can a man die better
than facing fearful odds
for the ashes of his fathers
and the temples of his Gods""

and initiates the nuclear device that was with them. An immense explosion reeks through the universe and in the next scene, we see Julia, who waking up surprised from her sleep pod back at the cottage house, observes the massive destruction of Tet with a tear rolling off her cheeks.

If I've given you enough spoilers, I'll leave the last 5 minutes of the movie for you to watch. A carefully planted re-incarnation awaits Julie 3 years after these incidents. Go find out!

I want to conclude by stating that the story Kosinski has crafted is decently believable. If readers don't go too deep into asking how fusion energy can be generated from sea water, or why drones would need to be still 'programmed' in the year 2077, why ""Sally"" as a God is so easily defeated, Kosinski has covered up these weaknesses with a film that has continuity , a good music score, not too overpowering sound effects and moments that call your attention when the human element is thrown in.

Science fiction appeals when it draws attention to virtues that are distinctly human and what separates us from mere machines. When lies and falsehood cloud our reality, there is still something inside us that tugs and makes us want to return to our true selves. We find Jack agrees to listen to that inner voice.

Another essence of this movie is that it shows we all have a greater purpose in life and sometimes we find ourselves alone in trying to overcome formidable odds. Will we fear and duck the challenge, or face the odds? A man, as Jack Harper, couldn't serve earth better just as Horatius the one eyed Roman hero who agreed to stand on the other side of a bridge facing the Etruscan invasion while his countrymen chopped the bridge down. I give this movie 4 stars!",1406332800,3,12294,4.659132841328414

If you don't like Tom Cruise, this film may not be your favorite, although, I thought there were sufficient twists in the story to keep it interesting at least.  On the other hand, it's always nice to get a high production value sci-fi movie out of Hollywood.  There are too few of those as far as I'm concerned.",1405987200,3,595,4.412844036697248

2285943,4,B0009ESTDW,I think this is a great Sci-Fi movie. If you watch this be sure to watch the bonus items on how it was made.  The director used a novel concept where he projected the environment around the actors. It was not made to a blue screen. My hat is off to him.

It's fine in his personal life but Mr. Cruise, there are a lot of great actresses your age who are still hot.  Stop using younger babes to star opposite of you.  Once I think that they are playing your daughter in the movie and then you start to suckface with them, its kind of stomach turning.  Skip this one and go see Edge of Tomorrow even though he has yet another younger babe starring opposite of him as his love interest.  It's kind of like when Quincy had that hot babe on his boat in the show (Younger crowd...Youtube the opening credits of a show called Quincy, M.E.  lol...it's hillarious to prove this point).  Or, Hugh Hefner thinking that these younger babes are ""in"" to him for him or his looks.  If the director would of cut 30 minutes in this movie, it would of been better.  Sorry Mr. Cruise.  I'm still a fan, but stay in your own age range for your leading ladies.

2285990,2,B0009ESTDW,This comment is not about the blu ray quality or the delivery quality but about the movie itself.

2285993,2,B0009ESTDW,"I think that I am finally all burned out on movies being made with an overwhelming wash of special effects and very little of what could be a story at all.

The first 15 minutes of this film, I was really expecting it to be something great, but then this prolonged stretch of unwavering sameness just kept going on with very little of any kind of tangible story unfolding so, by about 45 minutes into the movie, I was getting really bored and didn't see or even expect it to improve and yet it wasn't even half way over yet.

I think I saw it all.  I might have fell in and out of a sleep mode during the last half hour of the film so when it ended, I didn't even understand why it just ended right there. Maybe I missed something, and if I did, it's sad to think that if anything tied everything all together or made the story suddenly make sense, well, it must have been very short and easy to miss during a prolonged yawn or a blink.

If I ever watch this movie again, I better have a double hit of some Red Bull so that I will be wired enough to not possibly fall asleep for at least a week. I'll wait about a month before I try this film again.  I bought it used, so I really gotta learn to be more selective when I take the risk of buying a movie I've never seen first.",1402444800,2,1275,4.003937007874016

Oblivion does not deliver anything new nor spectacular.

I expected something original and rewarding, and got Tom Cruise once again playing a character named Jack
(how many times has he played a hero named Jack through his movie career?... countless times).
The same thing goes for Morgan Freeman (no charisma whatsoever), I have seen him playing that 'role' too many times already.
Olga Kurylenko is the only one who brings some zest to this dry/clich Sci-Fi.

Pretty much the same movie as 2009, but more glamorous - that glass tower, that swimming pool - and with many more plot holes. The big budget effects and sets and costumes are glorious, though. That helicopter, that motorcycle! Landscapes are fantastic.

But the saggy plot totally rips off 2009's Moon, starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. Which I thought was a better movie overall. Well-acted, well-written, tighter plot. It's also claustrophobic and devastating to watch Sam Rockwell's character develop! Greatly underrated sci-fi film and I highly recommend you watch it sometime.

But if you want the big budget set with lots of explosions and a Hollywood ending - this movie is fine. Entertaining. You can watch Tom Cruise ride a motorcycle. Sure.

1) What happened to the moon, really, and why?

2) What happend to the earth, really, and why?

3) What happened to the 6-7 billion people?

4) How did they (The Tet) build the drones?  It was just Hal from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odessey.  Did they have a Drone factory?  And what was the Tet, anyway?

5) What was the Tet's motive in attacking the earth?

6) What were they doing to the earth with the huge water thingies, and why?

7) How could anybody enjoy a film without any storyline or plot?  It was simply a mashup of loud special effects bitten off other movies (Star Wars, etc.), with some emotional drivel thrown in, sporting an apocalyptic sci-fi ""aliens attack"" setting.  One of the worst movies of all time.

I honestly wish I had not wasted 2 hours of my life on this movie.  Tom Cruise - what the heck?  Why are you doing this to us?  And what about you, Morgan Freeman?  Making this crud!  You should be ashamed of yourselves!  Don't you people even READ a script before you sign the contract?  Gee whiz!

2286019,5,B0009ESTDW,"After seeing this movie in the theater, it instantly became one of my all time favorites.  I have watched it about another dozen times on Cinemax since, and will be purchasing the DVD as well.  I am a Tom Cruise fan, a sci-fi fan, and especially a post-apocalyptic sci-fi fan, but this movie stands on its own merits in just about every other regard as well.  It has a great supporting cast, phenomenal visual effects and soundtrack, intelligent storyline, plot twists, and much more.  The only [slight] disappointment I have is that I would have liked to see a little more character development and screen time with Morgan Freeman's character.

This movie is smart, intriguing, and draws you right into the plot and scenery.  I don't feel it rips-off concepts from other sci-fi films, rather pays homage, as the writers were going for.  The concept of the enemy faced by humanity is great (I won't give away any spoilers).  This said, if you are looking for a shoot-em-up, fast paced, action packed journey through the cosmos, then this isn't for you.  If you want a great story that makes you think and gives you some surprises, all the while dazzling you with great effects and scenery, as well as music, then this is for you.  Let's put it this way...this movie has much more in common, in terms of plot and action, with old-school Star Trek then the new Trek movies...in other words it's a thinker and a mystery with a sci-fi tone, rather than a shoot-em-up action ride.

The interesting plot, gorgeous landscapes, and CGI put this movie near the top of my most favorite movies. Despite it's less than stellar performance in theaters, I feel like this movie is quite undervalued.

Quick Plot (No Spoilers): Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is an engineer who has been tasked with maintaining a fleet of drones that are assisting in the salvaging of Earth in the year 2077, 60 years after a devastating alien attack. Humanity won the war with the aliens (called Scavs), but Earth was rendered uninhabitable in the process. Along with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), Jack counts down the days until their term on Earth will be finished and they can rejoin the rest of humanity on the space station Tet that orbits Earth and will leave for Saturn's moon Titan once salvage is complete. One day a mysterious spaceship crashes down to Earth and sends Jack down a path that will lead him to the horrifying truth of Tet and his own existence.",1400457600,,1056,4.708108108108108

2286026,5,B0009ESTDW,"Like any movie, YMMV.  For instance, my lady friend didn't just dislike this movie.  She hated it, even though she really likes Tom Cruise.  Then again, there are very few movies with a sci-fi theme that she thinks is worthwhile.  It's simply not her cup of tea.  And while it's not her most hated sci-fi movie (""Prometheus"" probably gets that honor), there was nothing she liked about ""Oblivion"".

There are many outstanding reviews that I've read here (especially M. Oleson's) that give intricate and informative details on the storyline, so I'll take a slightly different approach.  Obviously, I really liked ""Oblivion"" (I also liked ""Prometheus""), and for several reasons.  First, I enjoyed the story -- one major and a few minor plot holes not withstanding.  Oh, we've seen variations of this story many times, but that doesn't mean I lost interest.  There were times I knew it was purposely oblique, but thought it stood up really well when taken in total.  This is the type of movie where a second viewing may be warranted (I've watched it multiple times).  Secondly, the picture quality is absolutely top tier, stark and pristine  and so were the sets.  In a word, stunning!  Thirdly, the soundtrack.  It's an incredible, soaring soundtrack throughout that really pulls you in and doesn't let go.  And finally, the depth of the bass.  This movie will shake your walls and slam your body hard (if one has the equipment) with clean, powerful bass.  There is one scene where they use a bass sweep that hits single digits (below 10 Hz) that will put a smile on just about any face.  This Blu-Ray's sound capability will far surpass what any theater can reproduce (even the Arclight in Hollywood).  Theaters simply can't plumb the depths that a well-integrated home theater with powerful subwoofers can, nor do they try.  It's simply not feasible to try and reach anything below 30 Hz due to the sheer volume of a large theater.

Rating:

Picture quality:  10 out of 10 (I have never seen better)
Sound quality:  10 out of 10 (did I mention the incredible bass and the impressively soaring and dramatic score?)
Story and presentation:  marginal 7 out of 10 (I had a few issues with parts of the storyline)
Overall: marginal 9 out of 10 (which means that I highly recommend it)

Summary:  If you like sci-fi and have a nice home theater with some potent subwoofers, I can't think of a better movie to showcase.  As an example, ""War of the Worlds"" is renown for its impressively potent and stellar bass (DVD and Blu-Ray are equally as good and rated 5-stars on AVS), and ""Oblivion"" (Blu-Ray) is just as impressive.",1400112000,2,2615,4.759465478841871

2286044,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is kind of like a cross between the gloriously clean visual style of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the more involved, exciting simplicity of Star Wars: A New Hope. The film is simply beautiful in its sparse aesthetic design, elegant technology and breathtaking cinematography. And of course the musical score, as well, with involvement from M83. Tom Cruise is very good in this, as a character who involves the viewer but never overwhelms the story or setting. If you have only read a brief synopsis or saw the trailer, you may be in for some surprises upon actually watching this film, which is a nice thing to be able to say.

In an age where science fiction films are often cluttered, messy and frenetic (which can be good in some cases, granted) Oblivion is a refreshingly different creature. Watching it really feels like taking a breath of fresh air.

I'm a hard core Sci-Fi watcher, and can usually predict where the plot is going, but there were a couple of twists that surprised me; something I love in a movie. But even if your not into the genre, you'll enjoy this movie if you like a mystery.

By the way, I would have given it the fifth star had there been another leading man. As I said, I'm no cruise fan.",1397606400,2,428,3.9080459770114944

But as we watch we realize that something is wrong. We are watching two earthlings assigned to monitor earth. Why is this necessary? Their memory has been erased. Why?
 Tom Cruise plays his part well. He has flashes of his past. He wants to explore what he is told not to explore, and he and we discover the truth.

All this while Cruise and his ""companion"" live in a luxury ""condo in the sky"" which includes a transparent swimming pool.  SPOILER ALERT:  Cruise is all gungho with his responsibilities, but seems to be finding things that ""distract"" him from his usual duties AND he encounters little clues that raise his curiosity contrary to the wishes of his companion.  This escalates when he encounters a crashed spaceship and manages to find a survivor... a beautiful female.  He has been experiencing fragmented ""dreams"" and it turns out the survivor is the woman in his dreams and events escalate thereafter...

2286103,3,B0009ESTDW,"You'd think that producers would have realized by now that CGI does not guarantee a great film experience, that the basics of plot and character still count.  But no, we are continually dished up visual extravaganzas that have about as much originality as a 50s cowboy formula flick.

This is a film about an outpost, run by Cruise and his girlfriend, which they believe is an outpost that will enable humans to colonize a moon and start over after a devastating war with a mysterious alien race.  The way that they live is fantastically vivid, as are the automated weapons that Cruise maintains to protect huge fusion reactors visible across the horizon.  It is a good life, but they are doing time, waiting to rejoin their cohorts on a space station.  Nonetheless, amidst his dangerous work routine, Cruise is disturbed by visions, seemingly old memories, of a girl he once loved, even though his memory has been ""wiped"" to protect information he purportedly has about the satellite.

Things, it seems, are not what they appear.  And, of course, they turn out not to be.  On the positive side, the actors are good.  I am a Cruise fan, and Kurylenko and Morgan Freedman give strong performances, too.  I do not want to reveal the surprise explanation, and there are some nice twists, but really, once you have seen this you will not want to watch it over and over - there is not much to savor, beyond dazzling visuals and Cruise-style action.  Scratch beneath the surface, and you get next to nothing.

I would only recommend renting this.  The fancy formats are fine, but why buy it for the rare viewing?",1394496000,5,1606,4.692857142857143

2286106,4,B0009ESTDW,"I knew this was a post-apocalyptic like sci-fi movieand I'm a fan of this genre. It was definitely different than most I've seen, and the ability to keep me on-edge (figuring something was going to jump out at any time) was something few films make me do these days. Some reviewers may give away the plots in their reviews but not I! The twists and turns in this film are mostly unpredictable. The film was shot in many parts of the world, including Iceland, and much of what you see is ""in camera"" (meaning, not using green screen effects added later). Even some of the sky imagery was created using projectors instead of green screen visuals.

The video quality was excellent and the HD audio was incredibly full (almost too much low-end at times). The special features on the blu-ray provide a decent behind-the-scenes look at how it was made. I definitely recommend the blu-ray version (the digital copy is fine for mobile devices but just doesn't have the same quality as the blu-ray).

Why not 5 stars? Heh, 5-stars are reserved for masterpieces or future classics (in my eye). This is a very good sci-fi film, but I can't put it up there with the classics.",1394323200,4,1163,4.613526570048309
2286107,2,B0009ESTDW,This is certainly a handsome looking production and things blow up real good. I can't figure if the makers of this film are assuming the audience's intelligence or stupidity.  The plotting here is so dense that it renders the narrative incoherent.  I scratched a groove in my scalp trying to figure this movie out.  Tom Cruise looks perplexed.  Morgan Freeman collects another paycheck for basically showing up.  Best scene in the movie is the skinny dip between Cruise and Andrea Riseborough.,1394323200,,493,5.037037037037037
2286108,1,B0009ESTDW,"So, yeah, Cruise and Freeman draw you in but never manage to explain what they are doing. The movie is very weak in story and plot and is explained in random spurts of unintelligible dribble.  It is more interesting if you just turn off the sound and watch the movie, making up your own plot as you go along. I never expect or am a fan of Cruise but Freeman keeps slapping his name on these junk shows. Does he really need to take that many flying lessons?",1394236800,3,456,4.181818181818182

Cruise is in fine form in this ""last man on earth"" post-apocalyptic tale. What the movie does best is a gorgeous visual aesthetic and pulsing electronic score featuring some quality acting.

However, the ideas are nothing new with a familiar story to most genre fans. The twist is good but not great, and a wee bit convoluted as well, though it sure wants to blow your mind. The film's opening expository voice-over is quite dreadful too.

But Oblivion is always nice to look at with some decent action/romance beats too.",1394150400,,591,4.718446601941747

It was intelligent, without the obscure, boredom of 2001; it had action, without the shoot 'em up blood and guts of Alien; and the ending was satisfying, unlike many Sci Fi Movies. For whatever reason the premise, the actors, and the story line all worked for me. I didn't have to go back and watch it several times just to understand something or catch a fleeting scene. Overall a great film. Some have tried hard to find fault - but I simply liked it the first time I saw it. Get it and see for yourself; you won't be disappointed.",1393891200,,576,4.293577981651376

When I saw the movie, it was very well written. It had a small cast, but each of the primary characters were very well done by the actors. This movie had great special effects. I liked how the set was both futuristic but also demonstrated all of the destruction on the planet. I also really enjoyed how the screenplay slowly revealed what was really going on, despite the way things seemed. That was quite a twist in the storyline.
There were quite a few things on the set of this movie that took real vision to set just the right atmosphere necessary for this movie. Kudos.
I enjoyed this movie so much that I had to add it to my collection. I was thrilled when I found the Blu-ray, dvd and digital copy edition on sale just before Christmas. I have really developed a preference for buying movies that have a digital copy available whenever it's possible. Now I can even watch this movie and enjoy it with a collection of other digital movies on my pc.

Some are good and some are just overdone with the same concepts. This is one is a much different approach to the genre. I like Tom Cruise and he did great in War of the Worlds. His plays this character very well and the landscape is much more creative. Yes...there is CGI involved but it was about the only way to create the floating house he lives in, high in the sky. I wish I had a home like that myself. Good action and story that you won't find on cable TVs Sci-Fi channel.",1392422400,,649,4.2

Watch the trailer and walk away. The making of the movie short is very good and draws you in, and makes you want to watch the full movie, and the trailer, screen shots are also spectacular. So, just be satisfied with that and save your money.

This film is a lame, repetitive, movie with a lackluster script.
The kind of movie you find yourself doing other things while you watch it,  like looking for another movie to watch.

From a true SCI-FI perspective some may get a kick out of it; for those who need dialectic and connections between characters, this movie is very lacking and seems like a bunch of scenes cut together in an editing room.

So you get a nice picture, shallow Sci-fi story with Cruise hamming it up as usual. The story is ok, but almost like his new movie coming up? pointless repetition if you ask me.

Once you've seen this, there's almost no reason to watch it again unless you're in love with watching Tom Cruise himself. The story is predictable and rather small in scope like most modern films which is sad.",1392163200,2,566,4.66

Costumes where ideal and represented a wild west indicator of good guys and bad guys; white hat vs black hat in westerns.

The only problem I had (other than a few excusable plot holes) was the fact that having Tom Cruise, kindof took away from the mysterious setting of the story because every time he's on the screen it reminds that it's just a Hollywood blockbuster, and you always see that guy in movies.  This would have been a perfect movie for a breakout star (and freeman could have still generated some name recognition).

Still, surprisingly worth watching if you're into sci-fi blockbusters.  Way better than Elysium, which shares a ton of similar attributes, but wasn't good at all IMHO.",1391904000,,722,4.837398373983739

It has a real plot, action, scenes and cool tech.  It has a real love story as opposed to the typical sci-fi lust stories.  The story tells of the treacherous circumstances of the characters with the minimum amount of carnage and destruction to make the point.  Jack (Tom Cruise) is trying to regain his humanity in a truly inhuman construct.  Which speaks to all of us today in our pseudo-social networked devices.  How did this movie get such smug reviews?

2286179,3,B0009ESTDW,"This product arrived undamaged and quickly.

As for the movie itself, without spoiling the plot(s), lets just say my wife and I really found nothing new about this film's story.  It reminded us of Mad Max, specific episodes of the Twilight Show, a specific movie of Star Trek, undertone of Matrix, and a few other movies.  Don't get us wrong, it was a good movie, but many of the concepts seem as though taken from past films.  There were a lot of aspects were you could point out many plot holes, especially near the end.  Yet taken at face value, it was a good moviejust not great.  The acting was good, the images were great (often beautiful), and the situationthough similar to past movies, was interesting.  We would have given it more stars, but there were just some aspects that made absolutely no sense and we didn't feel the plot had us locked in.  Some characters place themselves in idiotic and dangerous locations when you know they never would have prior, other situationswell, we just don't want to ruin the story by the flaws we found with the film.

However, do not get us wrong, it was not a bad film by any means.  It was just common and somewhat lacking, thus our 3 star rating.  That being said, this is just our opinion, and if you love Science Fiction with a twist, this might be a great movie for you.

We hope this review helps.",1391040000,,1352,4.451219512195122

2286184,4,B0009ESTDW,"I mean... it's Tom Cruise. Any movie he's in, he's never anyone else but Tom Cruise. Rarely is he in a very deep or thought-provoking movie in this genre. (vanilla sky is one exception that comes to mind) Oblivion is good fun as ""sci-fi lite"" for when you want a fix without a labyrinthine plot. Basically the polar opposite of something like Blade Runner or Children of Men. (side note: I'm not sure I can name a movie where Tom Cruise disappeared into a role... he's always the same, good or bad you always just see him.)

Having said that, this movie has visual style to burn and is not without ""twists"" in the story. Everything is telegraphed prior to revelation and thus not much is terribly shocking for anyone that treads the science fiction waters regularly, but it is a solid movie. That's not to say that some won't miss those tells and be thus surprised at times... it is a well done movie with good talent all around. (yes, even Tom Cruise most of the time) Most reviews were overly harsh and similar to 2010's Tron Legacy, this was raked over the coals without giving it a chance. (Which may be more telling that you first think as they both were directed by Joseph Kosinski) It is allot of fun, especially when watching with others and the aforementioned popcorn. It is enjoyable.

I did mention style, and it truly oozes a visual flair that makes the world come alive. (or bleakly dead, depending on how you look at it) It comes from a comic (ahem, graphic novel!) and keeps that saturated look to it, which is a great feast on larger TVs. It is worth Buying Blurray over DVD without question. Note that this is not style over substance (say like Ultraviolet or Chronicles of Riddick) and this still runs plot circles around those types of movie. More-so, when stood up against most things from Marvel (which are firmly planted in the 'unsurprising-but-enjoyable' popcorn category) and everything from Michael Bay (which is in the 'throw-money-at-the-screen-and-don't-even-bother-to-stitch-it-together-intelligently' category) then this movie looks positively stellar.

It was also a great love story. And I thought Tom Cruise did a good job acting. What's the mind blowing scifi concept, to me, in this film is that our soul stays with us even if we're cloned, and as the character Jack says in the film, ""If we have souls, they're made of the love we share. Undimmed by time, unbound by death."" So even though there are many clones of Jack, he remembers the love he had for his wife. So, the question is, if we're cloned do we live forever? Do we have more than one soul? Does each of Jack's clones have a soul? As time goes on he remembers more and more. The idea of our existence, our consciousness, being transferred to a clone boggles my mind. Would it really be me? In the end Jack says, ""I am him"". He said, ""For three years I searched for the house you built. I knew it had to be out there, because I know him.""
[Julia and Jack stare at each other from across the lake]
Jack: [voice over] I am him.
[Julia's child points at Jack]
Julia's Child: Who's that?
Jack: [voice over] I am Jack Harper. And I am home.
[Jack smiles]

Some have mentioned the unemotional nature of the way the statements were made. I prefer that to ham handed, overly emotional ""acting"". To me, I could imagine myself in that situation, and I think I would have been about the same, not overly emotional. The overwhelming reality of what happened to Jack and Vica, and their legion of clones, is amazing. And the visuals of a future destroyed Earth were some of the best I've ever seen in a future Earth movie.

Lastly, it ended so well, so uplifting and happy, to me. ""The Road"" ripped my guts out and the visuals were much more spare, and the same with the ""Book of Eli"", there were some stunning visuals but they left you wanting much more. ""Oblivion"" has wonderful visuals, shocking and stunning, and they were satisfying, I didn't really need to see more. They showed you enough that you ""got it"" without over-doing it.

To me this is one of the best scifi films I have ever seen. I loved it. Also wanted to mention Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, his role was pretty small but still a good one, and in the end when he smiles, and he's got one of the greatest smiles, and it was perfectly timed. I hope to see a lot more of him in future films.",1390694400,3,2396,4.22707423580786

2286200,5,B0009ESTDW,"Too many reviewers are giving away to much plot.  One of the things that keep this movie going is that there are several plot surprises throughout the film.  Some of the reasons I liked this movie was because it is a fairly original idea as to how earth was attacked, why and by whom, not going to tell you.  The relationship with his female partner and back-up, if in trouble, make them a ""very effective team"".  The whole story about what his job is or may be is good.  Tom Cruise has memories but they can't be true, and the women he dreams about.  It is scary and sad to think that something like this could actually happen. who knows?  There is enough action but not so much to blur the plot and keep this film an adult Sci-Fi film.  There is a lot of beautiful scenery.  The special effects are first rate and much more realistic then all those silly hobbit movies.  Finally, all of the actors did an excellent job, and this is another very good performance from Tom Cruise regardless of the haters.  I think another reason this is a more intelligent Sci-Fi movie is because this is partially made by a foreign movie company and not the bankrupt of ideas Hollywood crowd.

Oblivion wasn't like that, this movie relied on the plot and great acting.  Yes, it had wonderful CG.  The visual of earth's destruction with M83's musical score, made you feel the loss of home and all that it represents, but Oblivion went beyond the visual.

No matter what you may feel about Tom Cruise (love him or hate him), he is a great actor and an even better protagonist because he sucks you into the story.  He makes you believe the unbelievable. The antagonist is also great, evil is beautiful and perfect... and a lie.  I hate spoilers, so I won't give anything away.

2286213,4,B0009ESTDW,"What makes Oblivion stand out to me is that it doesn't really focus entirely on laser beams shooting everywhere and several elements of hard-to-follow suspense and excitement like you'd typically find in such science fiction movies that deal with the destruction/deterioration of planet Earth.  Instead these particular type of segments only occurs occasionally.  In its place lies segments involving drama concerning Tom Cruise's wife from 60 years prior found frozen in a capsule, and how she wakes up to find the world in its current state which is practically in ruins due to an alien invasion being the reason.  Tom Cruise of course is the man who's expected to save planet Earth!  Who else to play that role, right?

While the occasional segments showing space crafts flying everywhere are certainly interesting and comparable to what you've seen countless times in similar science fiction movies, the storyline itself is rather confusing to figure out.  The doppelganger Tom Cruise that appears later on is when I finally got *completely* lost.  Also when Tom Cruise returns to his base and his current girlfriend (or wife- the redheaded chick) doesn't acknowledge the fight between her and Cruise that *just* took place a few minutes earlier apparently either because her memory went out or a change in time occurred without acknowledgement at some point.  Never could figure out which one truthfully.

Morgan Freeman is a fantastic actor in his role as a deep-voiced leader, Olga Kurylenko is ridiculously cute as one would expect (but exceptionally cuter here!) and so is Andrea Riseborough.  Despite the confusing storyline and never knowing what's really happening on screen, one area where the movie truly exceeds is in the visuals.  Despite millions of people having been killed years earlier and the destruction of several famous structures and landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, it all comes across appearing remarkably pretty and appealing oddly enough (especially the forest area that Tom would sometimes visit while listening to Led Zeppelin and Procol Harum, rock bands truly deserving of their classic status!)

Overall, pretty awesome film, but expect to sit through a fair amount of drama and even romance which is more of a focus than anything else.",1390089600,3,2280,5.199453551912568

2286216,4,B0009ESTDW,"I'm always looking for a good science fiction story, since there aren't very many out there, especially in film. This one delivers. It escapes the trap of overproducing the special effects and tells a good story that just happens to be set in a far-future of bleak reality. Still, the effects are good and well done. I never got the feeling that I was looking at a contrived setting.

I liked the way they handled the characters. We get to know Jack and Victoria Harper just as well as we get to know the back-story of their barren earth and their mission there, even though we don't have much time with them.

And a plus for me was the ending. Maybe I shouldn't have been, but the ending surprised me, and I'm always glad to see a story do that.

Most importantly, this movie touches on some of the themes that often get lost in science fiction, such as the need for a little peace and quiet along the lake shore and a connection to the past.

For once I'd like to see if they could make a movie of this type with NO hero.  That would be unique and refreshing.  Because of this unavoidable formula, these dramas are too predictable and I think it takes away from my expectations.  Special effects are good in this movie but even that is to be expected with the technology available today.  The story line needed to be more developed.  It was somewhat dull.  A multitude of Tom Cruise clones?  I wonder . . . were they all Scientology nuts . . . Or did at least one dwell in the house of reality and have his head screwed on straight?

2286220,4,B0009ESTDW,"The art direction, graphics, and soundtrack alone make this a really nice experience. I was impressed with the careful attention paid to every detail in this film and found the art direction and soundtrack to be exceptional.  There has been criticism of the film that it is highly derivative of a broad range of science fiction action films of the recent past but I found it entertaining and suspenseful. There was a consistency of vision in the film that must reflect what director Joseph Kosinski wished to achieve.

Tom Cruise proves once again that he can give a highly convincing performance as the leading man in a futuristic film. This future is bleak since earth is now a resource for a mysterious machine driven power that is sucking earth dry. Like many films and stories, Jack, the character played by Cruise, undergoes an awakening of consciousness regarding the power or authority under which he works. He discovers much about the rag-tag cave survivors on earth and in a play with time finds a capsule with a beautiful women inside.  The viewer makes sense of it all at the same time that the truth begins to unfold for Jack, a time honored technique in story-telling. Jack has had his memory erased and thus as he makes sense of the world in which he lives, so does the viewer of the film.

This is a good looking movie with some of the best art direction I have seen in a while. I loved the soundtrack, it was perfect for the look and feel of this film.",1389830400,3,1469,4.553030303030303

I regret not seeing it in theaters because I think this movie is underrated. It's a shame it under-performed at the box office. I suspect it will build up a nice following over time. As everyone seems to agree, it's visually outstanding. Acting is consistently good. Tom Cruise really is a fine actor and I think this is a terrific performance, subtle and restrained and just right. There are some elements that are awfully reminiscent of other science fiction movies, but it didn't distract at all from my enjoyment. There is an almost obligatory chase sequence...He's flying through some kind of big indoor space chasing and being chased and shooting at things, then squeezing through a tight spot to exit..I could have done without. Also, as much as I respect and admire Morgan Freeman, I'm wondering if it's possible WE CAN GET A FREAKING MOVIE WITHOUT MORGAN FREEMAN. Anyway. The movie has a fine twist to the plot that I didn't see coming. (It's clear that SOME kind of big plot twist is coming, but I wasn't at all sure of what it would be.)

2286226,5,B0009ESTDW,"After watching the TV trailers for this film, I had absolutely no interest in it. They emphasized the scene in the library which made this movie look just like any of dozens of pseudo sci-fi ""fight the monsters in the dark"" films. I've enjoyed some films of that type but after 30+ years they've worn thin by now.

Just for the heck of it, my wife and I just watched this on streaming video and found a VERY different film than expected. With a few action scenes worked in here and there, this is actually a very thoughtful and surprising post-apocalyptic sci-fi story.

Set about 70 years in the future, the Earth has reportedly won a war with alien invaders by resorting to the nuclear option. The relatively few people left have abandoned Earth to live on Titan (a large moon of Jupiter), and the few people left hanging around are protecting large machines that are generating needed power for the colony by sucking up the Earth's oceans.

Tom Cruise plays Jack, one of these survivors whose job is to repair weaponized drones which protect the power generating machines. Along with a female partner, they spend their nights in a luxurious base and their days working to find and repair drones downed by the remnants of the invading army.

The surprises in this film won't be shocking for highly experienced sci-fi fans, but their gradual revelation makes for a very intriguing and very thoughtful story. Jack's increasing self-awareness and his struggle to arrive at the truth is a fascinating story which is 180 degrees different than the movie suggested by the ads ... and trust me that's a GOOD thing! :-)

Well, any more than this and I'd be getting to spoiler territory ... as if there likely aren't hundreds of reviews with spoilers out there anyway. LOL I'll just say that we found this to be an excellent film with plot twists that kept us guessing for quite some time. Cruise leads a cast full of the excellent acting performances that drive this first rate plot.

The special effects are clean and convincing. The HD streaming version looks great, although the dialogue at times seems to be a bit low compared to the surrounding ambient noise and audio effects.

2286235,4,B0009ESTDW,"Its 2077. The Earth has been rendered virtually uninhabitable after an alien invasion that took place sixty-some years earlier. Even though the humans technically won the war (using nuclear weapons which pretty much wiped everything out), most of the planets survivors have long since moved to a colony on one of Saturns moons, leaving behind only a handful of people, like Tom Cruises Commander Jack Harper, as part of the  mop-up crew, whose job is to repair drones and to make sure the alien remnant known as the scavengers don't interfere with the continued production of fusion power from the oceans that is needed by the humans living up on Titan.

Complications arise when Jack rescues a female flight commander (Olga Kurylenko) whose vehicle is shot down by Scavs. Trouble is he thinks he may remember her from a time before he had his memory swiped as a needed security precaution given the sensitive nature of his job and mission.

Oblivion is a visually elegant film from director Joseph Kosinski, adapted from his graphic novel, which was never published. The screenplay by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn has some of the opaqueness of Inception, as, like a master card dealer, it shuffles the planes of reality to the point where the characters and the audience cant quite make out what is actual and what is a mixture of dreams, memories and alternate realities. Similarly, the filmmakers seamlessly blend CGI action, metaphysics and a surprise, turnabout ending to create a subtle, thought-provoking vision of technology in a post-apocalyptic future.

Oblivion takes its time telling its story, more concerned with mood and impression than with whiz bang action and plot details - though it doesnt stint on either of those two things either.

Andrea Riseborough, Melissa Leo and Morgan Freeman round out the cast, though Freemans character feels more plot contrivance than genuine person.

It really gave the sense that earth had come to an end and only bits and pieces were left, like some of the landmarks shown in New York. I bought this movie from amazon and have watched it again. Knowing the end of the movie, it was very cool to try to catch things i missed seeing it for the first time. Action sequences were top notch, and Cruise and Kurylenko make it easy to invest in their characters. WORTH THE BUY!",1388966400,,473,4.1521739130434785
2286241,3,B0009ESTDW,"If you're looking for an okay sci-fi post-apocalyptic movie to watch, you could do worse than Oblivion. You could do a lot better too. It's the future and astronaut Jack Harper (Cruise) is running around doing work fixing machines on a destroyed planet Earth. Earth is all messed up because aliens blew up the moon 60 years ago. The movie has some great visuals and, while there is a lot of predictability, there's enough to keep you guessing and engaged in the movie. They did a good job keeping it only 2 hours long. No need to stretch it out, just present a good popcorn flick.

The only things that really bugged me about Oblivion were the Matrix rip-offs. Yes, a man vs. machine sci-fi film is going to draw those comparisons, but the droids in Oblivion are ridiculously similar to the sentinels in The Matrix, and I expected to see Neo show up in one of the final scenes of the movie (""Whoa!"").

In a lot of ways Oblivion also reminded me of the movie ""Moon"" with Sam Rockwell. Kind of ironic that they blew up the moon in this and the entire story of THAT film takes place on the moon. ""Moon"" is FAR superior to Oblivion. Less action and CGI, more suspense and drama. If you liked Oblivion, you'll love Moon. If you didn't like Oblivion or only thought it was so-so, you'll enjoy Moon more. And you won't leave that one thinking you've just seen an elaborate Verison ""Droid"" commercial!",1388966400,,1393,4.480314960629921
2286242,5,B0009ESTDW,"I braced myself at first thinking this would another Cruise movie, but was pleasantly surprised! Many reviewers have stated the plot is a repeat of many other sci-fi movies, but this films delivery is what makes it so enjoyable and that alone deserves kudos! The cinematography is beautiful and offers many details for the eyes, pair this with the movies soundtrack and you get a wonderfully complimented pair that adds new twists from start to finish. The cast is excellent
So, we follow Cruise onto future Earth, as all humans have left for a safer planet while he and his stand-in wife Riseborough work together to patrol the Earths resources and protect their mining sites. The story now begins with an inquisitive Cruise who presses to uncover the war, the Earths resources, the truth behind a mysterious crash site and the cause of his dreams, who the Scavs really are and how he can start over.
Overall, I highly recommend watching this flick to the science fiction fans.",1388966400,2,978,4.8273809523809526

2286249,3,B0009ESTDW,"For one thing, the art direction is superb, and the special effects to die for. That's why there's 3 stars. Unfortunately, this is basically a variation of the plot of Battlefield Earth morphed with Independence Day, Battlefied Earth was one of the worst plots ever, so please hollywood, stop remaking that.

Oblivion does a much better job with the plot, but the flaws that existed in Battlefield Earth still exist here.. in that once you make the aliens so superior, the possibilities of actually winning literally hard to believe.

The first half or 2/3 is very watchable, visually stunning. Rent it for that alone. But there is a demarcation line (and you'll know when it happens) when the movie changes from a contemplative SCIFI story into a cheap video game mentality. It's like there were two different directors.

I believed.  At just the point when I was wondering what was happening, things started kickin' ! The plot was much more intriguing than I thought earlier in the show.  It's complications were unsettling and made for a terrific and powerful movie.  The characters were all stellar :) the FX were truly inspiring, and the story was compelling.

It was very good science fiction, well thought out and very well acted. It just proves that you cannot trust the reviews.

Most of the ""reminders"" of other films the reviewers pointed out, can be found in any science fiction from almost any year. I won't go into detail, because I think the claims are unwarranted criticisms of ""Oblivion"". Some of the films critics said it ""copied"" from were films that were written after ""Oblivion"". The original treatment for the film was written by the director, Joseph Kosinski, in 2007. Nonetheless, all science fiction films ""borrow"" from multiple sources. Most likely from science itself. I cannot recall the exact details of what was ""borrowed"", but I do remember that they were pretty common traits of many science fiction stories.

2286294,4,B0009ESTDW,"When Tron 2 Screenwriter, Joseph Kosinski, started shopping for a Publisher for his graphic novel, Oblivion, they told him it was so good that he should bring it right to the big screen. Before you know it, some big names signed out and the film was released as a big budget blockbuster. There are a ton of cool gadgets in a story about a futuristic world, that has been destroyed by war. What initially turned me on to this film was the trailer, which show you the technology, but tell you almost nothing about the story. The films description is the same way, it tells you very little and really gets your curiosity going. The story starts by telling us what has become of the world, 65 years in the future. The planet has been destroyed by war and the humans have left the planet for one of Saturn's moons. All that's left is a bunch of technology meant to harvest Earth's resources for the people on Titan. The remaining rebels mean to sabotage this technology and it's the job of Jack and Vicka to repair and protect the technology from the last remaining terrorists. Tom Cruise stars and by now we all know how I feel about Tom Cruise. Fortunatly for Mr. Kosinski, this was a film that Cruise was really into and he does give one of his strongest performance since Minority Report. Cruise is terrific and is the main reason this film works in the beginning. With the extensive back story, it takes a while for anything substantive to happen and that's where Cruise and the unique technology come into play. They carry the film from the shocking beginning into the heart of the story. Once this film gets going it is one of the best pure Science Fiction films to come along in years. To his credit, even though the film is weird and starts out slow, Kosinski wouldn't let Hollywood touch it. The result is an old school type of Science Fiction film, done with modern technology. The geeks will love this movie, but there is also enough of a side stories and some amazing special effects that will help gain the majority of audiences. Oblivion was a terrific ride and something you don't see everyday, I really can't recommend it enough.",1388016000,2,2141,4.534883720930233

2286298,5,B0009ESTDW,"2013 was a great year to be a science fiction movie fan. More than 10 sci fi films were released, all with great potential to be be top-notch.

To be 100% honest, I didn't have high hopes for Oblivion if only because the other films looked so strong by comparison. Oblivion exceeded my expectations and then some.

I won't go into the storyline as many other reviewers already have. I will say that yes, certain elements are derivitive. There are parts of Independence Day, The Matrix and other (rather good btw) sci fi stories in the plot of Oblivion. However, at no point did I feel that any other film was being ""ripped-off"". Oblivion has enough of it's own original ideas and variation of classic themes to make it stand on it's own. New and old ideas both come together and make a rather satisfying film.

Tom Cruise is solid here as is Morgan Freeman (is he ever in a bad movie?). The rest of the cast - especially Andrea Riseborough - are both believable and relatable. I especially enjoyed Melissa Leo as ""Sally"". Definitely an interesting take on the character she portrays.

Lastly, both the special effects and score were great - both added quite a lot to the film.

Isn't that why we watch actors,to actually be entertained?I watched it three times so I could figure out some of the blurry areas of why,when and where. Part of that is due to our lack of a decent sound system and the other was that I just enjoyed it. My wife went out and bought the dvd for a Christmas present.

He has to carry the film basically and he deserves a lot of credit for it. this movie is a complicated film , that is extremely well done. In fact , it's one of the better sci fi films that I have seen in a while. Something that the great tv show 'the outer limits' would have done , without any big effects though. And this is spectacular in the special effects realm. It would have been better in 3d though.  I will say that if someone in a review tells you the plot of this movie , then  avoid it. other than if they say "" aliens destroyed the earth and tom is stopping the scaves""  then you will not know what is happening!  And that is the best way to watch this top notch sci fi film. The rest of the cast other than the other tech ,  are in very small parts. Morgan freedman and a few others have small parts but they do a good job. This is movie that you can't just half watch , you have to watch it and learn , what's happening as it goes along. It has a surprise in store for you.  I can't imagine any sci fi fan not enjoying this movie. The effects are so stunning and the story is excellent. Even 20 years ago this type of movie would have been impossible to film  properly.  It's taking place in 60 years but the tech does work , WHEN you see the ending. Till then I was like???? how did mankind get this advanced.  SO watch this and find out!  the blu ray is stunning!  More recent movies always look fantastic on blu!  And this one especially so. There are four deleted scenes that should have been put back in to the film. as they were very short and one of them 'the archive' is important to the story.  this is worth watching. It's a nA movie of the highest caliber.",1387843200,,1956,4.0625

I was a bit hesitant on seeing this as I saw the trailer for this before it came out in theaters. But because Tom Cruise was in it as well as the incomparable Mr. Morgan Freeman I just HAD to see it!

2286308,3,B0009ESTDW,"The visuals in this movie are gorgeous; this is worth owning on Blu-ray if you have a large screen television.  The movie has some action and an interesting plot twist, but overall it plods along.  I think if it had been edited to cut out another 20 mins, it would have tightened it up.  Morgan Freeman has a relatively small role.  Also, the character that Tom Cruise plays has the name of ""Jack"" and everyone seems to refer to him by his first name, even when they are the only 2 people in the scene.

And then I saw it and it WAS exactly what I wished for but I realized I was completely outside of my mind. This sci-fi apocalyptic thriller had depicted humanity imprisoned to another planet, the protagonist Tom Cruise is a top gun astronaut that's blindly performing chores for round robots that continuously monitor ocean consuming machines for so called fusion energy that we are led to believe will be used on the planet that humanity now lives on. Sprinkle in a twist and Hollywood seems to think it'll be a blockbuster hit??? Ugh. There's really only one twist, and is it ever so cliche. Stick to the classics I mentioned above. This movie was definitely not to the caliber I thought it'd be. I've always thought Morgan Freeman could make any movie grand. Well, he finally proved me wrong.",1387497600,2,896,4.677215189873418

2286325,3,B0009ESTDW,"I expected a little more from this duo of Tom and Morgan.  They did an admirable job though, given the emotionless narrative of this futuristic story.  There just wasn't enough meat on this hog.

The quality of the image and sound were very good though.  A blue tinted world, cold and foreboding, but still managed to eek out enough flesh tones for our benefit.  The sound was impressive, although again, it was lacking much emotion.

Here's my big issue though...  Who came up with the original score?  It was worse than elevator music in a retirement home.  Harsh, brassy, and juvenile.  I mentioned an emotionless story?  Well, you got an emotionless series of background tracks too, baby!  Sympatico with our story here.

There was potential though.  Some moments of untapped human drama.  Some doors left unopened.  In a way, this film serves as a reminder that you should run with tears, if tears make a story better.  You should build sympathetic characters, worthy of our care.",1387238400,2,985,4.837349397590361

2286328,2,B0009ESTDW,"I normally enjoy Tom Cruise's movies a little. This movie for me moved my mind into a capsule of fantasy that was kind of like a bland dry saltine cracker. It starts off with a essence calming sterile fantasy...with its simplistic tone driving the romanticism. Watching it was like skipping pages in a book to blank ones then back to half a page then to a whole one...very choppy and cheap to me in a mild way. I kept on waiting for Jodie Foster to show up (Elysium)....ha ha. Anywho....I also wish they would have chosen another actress for Tom Cruise's lost wife (Olga Kurylenko). The actress they chose for the role...her heavy accent and whispery volume/voice made me want to stop watching. If the movie overall had been a stronger one with more action...then the light and airy presence Olga brought wouldn't have been so annoying. I appreciate the attempt for this movie made for something more blank canvas artistically, but it just didn't intrigue me enough to CARE.",1387238400,2,974,4.735294117647059

It is science fiction, and as such, I have to be careful to suspend disbelief on some of the practical matters ... not just the magic of future technology.  I don't know that it is especially profound or life changing - other than perhaps the power of love and need for companionship - but it offers some interesting ideas to contemplate.

Pretty violent, though not gratuitously visual in the violence.  Language seemed 'normal'.  Some sexual content, but again, much implied or masked.",1386892800,,621,5.029411764705882

It is not a short movie as it runs for 124 minutes. For a new director/writer's first outing, I have to say I am impressed. This movie has very strong visuals and the set designs are just remarkable. The story is rather simple but it was well crafted, directed and acted. Sometimes, it is how the story is told that makes up for the simplistic story and here in succeeds. The soundtrack is another pleasant surprise as it fits the movie to a tee.

2286370,1,B0009ESTDW,"Please note, I did not purchase this disc from Amazon. I bought it new at BestBuy.

This is a review of the Blu-ray disc itself, not the movie. I enjoyed the movie enough to buy it after renting it on a previous occasion. Not sure what the issue is because I experienced the same exact problem from a rented Blu-ray version of this movie. I ended up bringing the Blu-ray back to the rental store to trade for the regular DVD version.

I load the movie into my Sony Blu-ray player, it spins, it does it's Blu-ray internet loading thing, it plays the Universal logo video clip, does more internet loading, then it just sit's there!!! I can't play it, I can't skip to the next chapter, I can't fast-forward, I can't navigate to the movie's main menu, I can't do anything except eject the stupid disc!!!!!!!!!!

The same exact thing happened with the Blu-ray rental disc. It simply won't play no matter what I do!!! I hope I can get my money back from BestBuy.  :(

*** Follow up ***

As it turns out, a great many other people are having the same problem with this and other Blu-ray disc titles. Apparently, the fix is to disconnect your Blu-ray player's internet connection. After doing that, it should play fine. It worked! Now my disc plays as it should. WTF????",1386201600,,1262,4.465217391304348
2286371,4,B0009ESTDW,"From a technical aspect, this movie is stunning, from the visuals, sounds, and score (great score by M83).  I have to give kudos to the sound engineers for making the vocal distinct, from low to high levels of sound.  I hate movies that blast you with volume while vocals are low and hard to hear.

The bluray version of this movie will definitely showcase a good home theater setup.

The only ding, and a disappointing ding for me (and hence the lack of a 5 star technical review), is that the True Dolby HD isolated score is staticy and drops out on my setup.  Searching around, it appears I am not the only person that has experienced this problem.  I have a Sony S790 BD player with dual HDMI output (one to my receiver and one to my TV).  It is possible the problem is not disc related, but have not had the time to do more experimentation.

As for the movie itself, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed, and liked it more after a repeat viewing.  Repeated viewings give you better appeciation of the technical aspects of the movie along with character reactions (especially Julia, played by Olga Kurylenko) in certain scenes.  Although Tom Cruise does his best in real-life to make you hate him personally, he does an acceptable acting job.

The movie does have some predictability in the plot and shades of other past sci-fi movies, but not everything is explicitly explained (especially the motives of the alien), requiring the viewer to figure things out on their own (which I like).  If you are a serious sci-fi fan, and if you take some time to readup on some of the insights of the film makers, you may gain a greater appreciation of the movie.",1386115200,,1661,4.5369127516778525

2286374,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is an entertaining film, with excellent visuals, a finely crafted setting, and strong lead character. Tom Cruise does an excellent job as Jack Harper, nailing both action and emotional scenes. The action is a treat, though the climactic shootout is a bit clumsy.

If sci-fi tech is a draw for you, there is plenty of drool-inspiring technology in this film - cool ships, cool weapons, the greatest AI drone sound effects ever created, and computer GUIs that can only be described as arousing.

There were a few aspects to the story that seemed unbelievable, but actual got explained later on. The plot pulled a few surprises, which was a treat as I went into this expecting a very straightforward story.

I knocked off a star because some of the supporting characters (particularly Morgan Freeman) were underwhelming, and the end was too cheesy. Despite these misgivings, I'd recommend it overall if you're a sci-fi junkie.",1386115200,,932,5.0

  on the cover, there were many flattering adjectives used  to describe  this movie. I think they fell short.
  1-intense. this wasn't exactly  a war movie or a psychological thriller, so no.
  2-spectacular-yes-there were some great visuals and neat ideas.
  3-ground breaking. no. while the movie was very pretty and  very full of  great science stuff, there wasn't anything going on I haven't seen before.
  4-visually stunning-yes. this movie was full of ""lord of the rings"" worthy graphics with the awesome epic scale back drops and what not. it is very beautiful for many scenes and is pretty for  stretches sometimes adding to the overall entertainment and artistic value.
  5- mind blowing-no. it takes a lot to really blow a mind. while there are a lot of unexpected things going on. i'd call it more ironic than mind blowing. there were a few places that made me go, ""whooooooaaaahhhhh, dude!"" but no mind blowing.the cover also says he will ""question everything he knows"". that is true.so I was waiting for a big ending like say any of these movies....""planet of the apes"", ""total recall"", ""matrix revelutions ""  ""death race 2000"", ""1984"" , ""a midsummers night dream"", ""2001: a space odyssey"" or ""fight club"". of course, I cant tell so you will just have to watch. its worth it.,
  this is morgan freemans third movie I know of where he gets to be a  great mind. the others are Lucius fox from the second batman trilogy and  when he played  GOD  in "" bruce almighty"".  this character is Morpheus like. Morpheus is the black guy in the ""matrix"" movies.
  on the cover, it says that tom cruise finds a beautiful stranger. the chick he's already with was very  very pretty. she had a nice body, not trashy, but nice. she had really pretty eyes and a heart melting smile. what did he even need this new woman for ? someone was mixed up there. I did not like that part.
  this movie is about a guy who can pilot spacecrafts in a post apocalyptic earth. THINK  ""terminator"" meets ""top gun"".
  all in all its pretty good. it made my top 85 movies of all time list.its a lot better than a lot of the junk that's been coming out lately. so its refreshing and fun.

It is well enough achieved to allow the viewer to accept these stunning images as real and become immersed in the picture.  Sadly, though, Tom Cruise - who is capable of some pretty fine acting - is just Tom Cruise.  He's wooden and predictable.  Even Morgan Freeman somehow felt like he was just being himself.

2286383,3,B0009ESTDW,"ON the good side: great pictures, breathtaking shots and scenes in the atmosphere an on the ""ruined"" Earth as well. Well done.
The problem is that these are kind of standard now, so acting and story still, or even more make a difference. After 10-15 minutes, when you get used the style (unexpected camera-angle changes and openings) and you start focusing on the story, you start to develop a sense of emptiness. Which not because of the hopeless future of Earth, as the movie suggests it, but because the story is very shallow. Without ruining the story for those who haven't seen it yet, don't expect anything unexpected, or smart. (Note: I am not a Cruise fan: ) Also, I think Cruise has been stuck on the sad no-man's land between the charming boy and the wise man (he may never get there). I don't think that showing his butts and his (okay for a man in his fifties) chest is enough to make a good movie.
Okay if you are tired and just want to relax and make your visual-mind-center work, but you are better of not watching it if you into sci-fi and like the intellectual part of movies.",1385769600,6,1093,4.442786069651741
2286384,3,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion(released April/13)stars,among others,Tom Cruise,Olga Kurylenko,Andrea Riseborough,Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Oblivion is certainly a different film,and Cruise is back doing what he does best;playing the intense,somber but conflicted role we know him to o so well. While he and co stars have a lot to say and do,the ultra long story has just far too much to tell,as it jumps from one narrative to another and back again. It unfortunately drags the film down and us with it.
Speaking of which,we find ourselves in the year 2070. Earth is in total shambles and our hero is living high above the Earth with his female counterpart. They are singly manning the maintenance and security of the planet after its devastation involving a global conflict with aliens some 60 years before. There are gigantic water sucking machines that provide needed energy for the Earth colony on the moon of Titan,the largest of Saturn's moons. To aid the pair in their tasks are drones,round flying machines that help the pair cover the long distances involved in their jobs. They are monitored constantly from the ""Tet"",a gigantic space ship,which is the transition platform for those heading from Earth to Titan. In fact Cruise and his colleague are due to leave their posts in two weeks,barring any complications.
Cruise has been bombarded for ages by memories of a woman he met on top of the Empire State building. One day they pick up a transmission coming from the top of that same building;the rest of which is buried deep beneath in the ground. He investigates to find out it has been deliberately programmed for transmission into space and for coordinates in a zone on Earth where there is no known life to speak of. Cruise cuts the signal,but shortly there after a space craft falls from the sky. Upon his arrival at the crash site he manages to rescue a woman from a stasis tube. A drone,also dispatched to the area from the Tet,kills the remaining survivors,much to his chagrin. The woman,as it turns out,is the self same one from Cruise's dreams.
Cruise returns the tube to his habitat high above the Earth. They bring the woman back to life and interrogate her as best they can. Her main concern is getting the flight recorder from her crashed ship. Reluctantly Cruise takes her planet side and both get taken prisoners by Scavengers,or Scavs for short. It is these people that Cruise has been told were of alien origin and the ones that still sabotage their equipment. The Scavs however have a different story to tell. They are not of alien origin but human,and have been fighting the real aliens for years;the ones from the Tet who invaded Earth originally. They(the Scavs)want to send a destructive device into the Tet and blow it up,but they need Cruise to program a drone for them. When he refuses they send him and the woman he revived back into the wilderness to find answers in a radiation zone no one has been able to enter. Along the way the two stop at the Empire State Building again where the woman rekindles his memories further,only to find she is his wife. Cruise's partner has sent his ship back down to him and sees the two in an embrace. When Cruise returns to the habitat she refuses his entry and reports him to their superiors. This has the effect of unleashing a special drone underneath the habitat which first kills Cruise's colleague then turns on him. He is saved by his wife.
The two flee but get pursued by three drones. Cruise manages to eliminate the three but not before he crash lands in the so called radiation zone. There his wife gets seriously wounded and  he finds out there are more caretakers like himself. In fact he witnesses one land and perform maintenance on a drone. It is in fact a clone of himself. While Cruise's official number is 49,this one's is 52. Cruise kills the clone,returns to the clone's habitat#52,greets his former colleague(obviously a clone also),and returns to Earth with a med kit to help save his wife's life. Armed with this new knowledge Cruise and his wife return to the Scavs and agree to help them defeat the aliens. Before they can get a programmed drone up and fling with the installed nuclear device,they are attacked by three more clones. Many people are killed,and its leader seriously wounded. The only option now is to take the bomb up to the Tet personally. Cruise puts his wife back into the stasis tube and blasts off to take her back to the Tet. Along the way he listens to the flight recorder which brings back more memories from his former life. Cruise now knows it was he who led the original expedition to Titan but was side tracked to investigate the Tet. Cruise ejected the stasis tubes on board before his ship was sucked into the Tet. The aliens then cloned Cruise and what would become his female colleague. The aliens sent thousands of Cruises to Earth to destroy the human population and left a few behind to tend to the planet destroying water devices.
Cruise manages to enter the heart of the Tet. When he opens the stasis tube it is the leader of the Scavs. Both Cruise and he detonate the bomb together destroying the aliens. Fast forward two years and Cruises wife and their daughter are now living in a remote cabin on Earth Cruise had built prior to his death. Out of some brush across a lake arrives some Scavs and Cruise,but the numbered 52 clone,the one we thought Cruise had killed. It seems his memories had been awakened by Cruise#49 and his wife's presence and he had been searching for her ever since.
There is much more to this plot,but as you can tell,it is long and very involved and we are taken back and forth,from one story to a back story,and back again and on and on. There are certainly some head scratching moments as when we get fooled by Freeman's presence in the Tet,and clone#52's appearance at the end as he""reunites"" with his wife. Also when we view the back story and see Cruise eject the stasis tubes from his ship which is getting sucked into the Tet,we must ask:why wasn't the ejected section also sucked into the ship?Cruise has tried everything in his power to get out of the TET's grip and failed,but an ejecting part of the ship miraculously could break away of its own power? Hmmm. And there is also the question of clones,as in how many more were out there with latent memories of Cruises wife and when they came searching what would they do when they found their wife? Hmmmm. Questions,questions and more questions,with no answers. Or should I say a lot of plot holes that are quite deep?You decide.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1. Extras include three featurettes,deleted scenes and commentary.
All in all while a nice looking film,it is more style without substance. Its long and involved plot gets you clock watching part way through and wriggling in your seat. This film is unfotunately not the sum of its parts. Nice try,but no cigars. 3 -3 1/2 stars.",1385769600,,6958,4.693944353518821

2286394,2,B0009ESTDW,"OBLIVION, starring Tom Cruise, is a science fiction movie, taking place on the planet Earth in the year 2077.  Tom Cruise plays a low-level employee. His job is to scout the surface of the planet Earth, and detect residual alien invaders who hide out in various parts of the landscape on the planet earth, and kill them.  The alien invaders are called, ""Scavengers.""  These Scavengers had destroyed the moon.  This effect was copied from TIME MACHINE, starring Guy Pierce.  Any person, having seen TIME MACHINE, will be startled by the shameless copying of the image of the broken-up moon, in the sky.  If you did a side-by-side comparison of the images of the broken-up moon, it would be apparent to you that this aspect of the  movie, OBLIVION, was copied from TIME MACHINE.  Also, the Scavengers had caused earthquakes and tsunamis, as part of their invasion of earth.  Tom Cruise, and co-workers, do their job from tetrahedral space stations that hover 3,000 feet above the ground.  These hovering tetrahedrons are inspiring to look at, and resemble the floating world in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, starring Ted Danson.  The other characters working on the tetrahedral station (Tower 49) are Victoria ""Vika"" Olsen, who also is a love interest, and  a supervisor, named, ""Sally.""  ""Sally,"" is seen only on a television screen.  Sally has an anonymous persona.  She utters ominous platitudes, such as, ""Are you working together as an effective team?""  Sally's character is like that of BIG BROTHER in the story, 1984.  Sally's image on the television screen is distorted by static.  This effect was copied from the original STAR WARS movies, where the hologram of Princes Leah was intentionally distorted by electronic static.  In this way, OBLIVION is derivative of STAR WARS.

When Tom Cruise encounters the Scavengers during the course of his routine hunting expeditions to kill the Scavengers, what is disclosed is that the Scavengers have voice-altering devices that cause their voices to have a non-human timbre.  This effect was also copied from STAR WARS.  During Tom Cruise's many trips to the surface of Earth, he frequently encountered half-buried, or substantially buried, artifacts from New York City.  These include buried versions of STATUE OF LIBERTY, EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  This was copied from the film, PLANET OF THE APES, written by Rod Serling.  In PLANET OF THE APES, we see a partially buried version of STATUE OF LIBERTY.

The first 60 minutes of OBLIVION is extremely tedious.  Tom Cruise makes repeated trips to the bleak surface of Earth, hunting for Scavengers.  On occasion, he finds them.  Sometimes, they are elusive.  Tom Cruise repeatedly flies through canyons, an effect copied from the early STAR WARS movies.  Please recall the fight scenes where space vehicles speed through a canyon on the DEATH STAR.  This kind of scene is repeatedly shown on OBLIVION.  Apparently, the director, screenwriter, and producer of OBLIVION thought that Americans are too stupid to recognize all of the features from PLANET OF THE APES, TIME MACHINE (with Guy Pierce), and STAR WARS, that had been re-cycled to make OBLIVION.  Because of this, and because of the extreme tedium that is produced during the first hour of this film, I give the rating of two stars.  Eventually, it becomes apparent that OBLIVION does, in fact, contain some very clever features in its storyline, e.g., erasing memories and making replacement clones of various characters.  But these clever features cannot overcome the disappointment caused by the tedium of the first 60 minutes, and the disappointment caused by the extremely derivative nature of OBLIVION, that is, its being derivative from other sci-fi movies.

I am sorry, Mr. Cruise, I truly loved your performance in WAR OF THE WORLDS.  And I loved your rapport with Dakota Fanning in that particular film.  The storyline, the character development, and the special effects, of WAR OF THE WORLDS makes that particular film one of my all-time-favorites.  However, I am sorry to report that, relatively speaking, OBVLIVION is a dud.",1385683200,4,4102,5.118975903614458
2286395,4,B0009ESTDW,"A film like oblivion can sometimes remind us that there is beauty even in the austere, even in the ruin.  While I personally like the greens and the blue hues of our planet the stark black and white and brown contrasts of the post-apocalyptic ""Oblivion"" starring Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, and a fetching Olga Kurylenko are almost attractively fetishistic in their composition.  I suppose that the heightened tension of all those killer drones that buzz about to kill humans (timely social commentary? or sci-fi coincidence?) exacerbate how the visuals will burn themselves into the viewer's memory.

The story of a clone (whoops! spoiler) who doesn't know what he is and learns that he's doing exactly the opposite of what he thought that he was supposed to be doing is carried out well.  That Cruise's Jack Harper character becomes conflicted due to recurring images/ memories of another life is a trope that is put to good effect.  The quiet and building dissolution of his relationship with his partner/ lover/ wife (?) Victoria (a sympathetic in spite of being cold Andrea Riseborough) as he comes into closer contact with his former wife Julia (Olga Kurylenko) plays out in subtle dramatic fashion and surprisingly makes this cold post-apocalypse feel warmer.  Freeman's (always a solid choice to get him into your movie) freedom fighter Beech is really only there to act as the cipher to Cruise's Harper who holds the key to someone's oblivion.

2286427,2,B0009ESTDW,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

In the U.S., 'Oblivion' grossed approximately $89 million. Overseas it was close to $197 million. What does this tell us? For all those non-English speaking people, the Oblivion narrative perhaps wasn't all that important--special effects and one action scene after another, were the key to the overseas success. Here perhaps word got out that this Tom Cruise vehicle was not as gripping in terms of narrative, as the Oblivion marketing people, led us to believe. There were possible reasons for this, mainly having to do with the nature of the story itself.

As I found this sci-fi, action adventure film to be mediocre at best, I have no trepidations about giving away the main twist that the main plot rests its head on. So if you haven't seen the film, I strongly suggest you quit reading here and read some of the more critical reviews found at Metacritic, which don't give away the whole kit and caboodle.

We're led to believe that Tom Cruises' 'Jack Harper', is a drone repairman in charge of servicing various sphere-shaped drones that emanate from a tetrahedral space station dubbed 'Tet', run by the 'good 'guys'--the surviving humans, represented by the mission commander, 'Sally', who it turns out is a computer generated entity, similar to the 'HAL' of 'A Space Odyssey'. Harper has been told that the drones service and protect fusion power generators on earth that are supposedly extracting the necessary energy for a plan to have the rest of humanity migrate to the Saturn moon, Titan. All this after an apocalypse on earth, caused by alien 'Scavengers'. Harper believes that humans defeated the 'Scavs' after they destroyed the moon, decimating earth due to the resulting gravitational shifts. Remnants of the Scavengers still remain on earth, attempting to destroy the drones which must keep the power generators operating.

Before the break into the second act of the story, 'Oblivion' operates as a typical sci-fi action adventure flick. Harper's significant other, Victoria (aka Vika), has dramatically little to do, operating the computer console and assisting Harper keep track of the drones back at their house 'in the clouds'. At a certain point, Harper gets involved in a chase with the drones very reminiscent of the chase inside the death star in Star Wars. Finally, things get mildly interesting when Harper saves Julia, a human astronaut in stasis from before the apocalypse on earth. Harper has vague memories of Julia, despite having his memory 'wiped' by his overseers.

When Harper discovers that he's a clone, he finally figures out that the 'Scavs' are actually the good guys as they are not aliens but humans who are battling the true aliens, represented by 'Sally' up in the 'mother ship'. So the second half has Harper joining forces with the Scavs, in their effort to destroy the aliens. It turns out that right before the alien invasion, there was a mission to Titan with the original Harper and Vika as the astronauts at the controls. Those two turn back to engage the aliens but before doing so, jettison the rest of the crew (including Julia), who turns out to be Jack's wife before the apocalypse. Harper and Vika are the prototypes used by the aliens to create the clones.

'Oblivion' asks us to applaud the twists and turns in the plot, particularly the revelation that Harper is a clone and the Scavs are actually human. But it's not enough to make this compelling drama. The problem is that Cruise is not pitted against a well drawn out antagonist throughout the narrative. Before the 'big twist', Cruise as Harper battles the faceless 'Scavs', who look like rejects from the first Star Wars series. Even after it's revealed that Sally and her minions, are the true villains, Harper spends most of his time battling the antagonists' surrogates: the drones who are constantly trying to annihilate him. This is also true of the first half of Act II--it's the opposition to the drones that basically fuels most of the conflict in the script. 'Oblivion' really is reduced to a standard sci-fi actioner for most of the time.

'Oblivion' also feels like an amalgam of many sci-fi predecessors. We've already alluded to 'Star Wars' but one is also reminded of 'Planet of the Apes', in its scenes of a ruined New York City after the apocalypse (here it's the shell of the Empire State Building which triggers Harper's memories of meeting Julia for the first time)--of course in 'Planet', it's the 'Statue Liberty' that gets the end of the world treatment.

Both 'Oblivion' and 'I, Robot' have similar antagonists--a female voice which represents an entire computer network. Both 'Sally' and 'VIKKI', serve similar functions and both Will Smith and Tom Cruise must destroy the network in order to save the day. 'I, Robot', however, is much more compelling since Will Smith's character has a complex ally to play off of ('Sonny' the robot). Not so for Cruise, whose strongest ally is Julia (who is hardly what you would call a foil at all).

'Oblivion' just rates an average 2.5 out of 5.0 in my book. It's got some nice special effects and that one big aforementioned twist. But in the end, 'Oblivion' is nothing more than a glorified 'shoot em up', with Cruise playing his usual 'good guy' part. I certainly wouldn't discourage the first time viewer from watching it but it's not something I would want to take a peek at, on a second go-round at all.",1384992000,3,5458,4.8717672413793105
2286428,3,B0009ESTDW,This was a good movie.  I found myself watching it all the way through.  The acting and special effects were good.  I don't think that you will be dissapointed,1384992000,,159,4.413793103448276
2286429,4,B0009ESTDW,"I am a picky Sci-Fi lover. This movie was panned. Why?

I know that the reviews aggregated by RottenTomatoes point to the 'trite' plot, though I think that's part of the brilliance. If you only pay attention for the first hour, you think that it's trite and unoriginal. If you keep watching, though, there are factors that come into play that you probably didn't expect at all. It becomes pretty interesting.

Additionally, the design is really quite cool, the photography is gorgeous, and Jamie Lannister and Maverick are in it shooting guns and stuff.

Yeah, there are a couple gaps in the plot, so it doesn't get five stars. However, I think that the purpose of Sci-Fi movies is to propose alternate realities and juxtapose them to what we know now, highlighting universal human traits and flaws or strengths within society. It does an alright job here and the visuals are enough to keep it interesting when the pacing slows down a bit.",1384905600,2,939,4.748466257668712

2286436,2,B0009ESTDW,"So here's the spoiler warning, because I'm not going to try to not talk about aspects of the movie, so, if you think, like me, that the movie looks cool and you're probably going to watch it anyway despite what I say (just don't do it. really), you shouldn't read this. If you want to know about all of the dumb (you should!), read on.

I realize this isn't an issue for some people, but it is for me, as I've mentioned before: The movie did that opening narration thing to explain what's going on. I'm convinced that opening narration is almost always a bad thing. If you have to have it, you have either (1) started your movie in the wrong place (2) failed to provide information within the movie in a way that works for the viewer. The Star Wars movies are one of the few places where you can find effective opening narration (in the form of the prologue scroll). And, then, not only did Oblivion open with the narration providing the viewer with an out-of-character monologue of events, but all of that same information was provided about halfway through the movie in almost exactly the same format. Please, do not provide me the same information more than once in your movie. I can almost guarantee you that I got it the first time (which is why I tell my kids to not repeat themselves when they do something they find funny: I did just see it happen).

Despite the opening narration, the movie doesn't make much sense. Ostensibly, Jack and Victoria are a team placed on Earth to defend these large fusion reactors, but, really, why are they needed? There's actually no good reason for them to be there. Sure, sure, he's some technician who has to repair the drones, but that's flimsy at best, because that whole set up is just to support the fact that they want this character that doesn't have any memories, but from any kind of logical standpoint, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, it might (almost) make sense if the stated premise of the movie was true, but you know it's not, because, even if it was, what would be the point of erasing the memories of the support teams? However, with the knowledge that the aliens are really in charge, there is absolutely no good reason to have things set up the way they are. Why do they need humans to repair their drones? And why, after the Jack clones fought for them as their army when they took over the Earth, do they need to trick the clones into believing they're normal humans anyway?

Then there's the problem of Jack having this whole wilderness retreat that he's built, somehow, without anyone finding out. He's able to just turn off the tracking unit in his (what I'm calling) dragonfly ship (which  is very cool, by the way) and go ""off comm."" What the heck? His navigator person (who never leaves ""the tower"") doesn't have any idea where he is when he does this and neither do the aliens. Seriously? They just allow him to go off and do secret things without bothering to know what he's up to. Completely implausible. Sure, it makes sense if you believe the story as it's presented at the beginning of the movie, but, again, you know that's not the whole story fairly quickly, and the idea that the aliens (or whatever) would just allow this is beyond imagining. It's what the writer/director do to support the lie and get the audience to buy into it, but those things need to make sense after the truth is revealed, too.

Jack has these dreams... dreams of being in New York before it was destroyed, but that was 50 or so years ago, and he's not that old. My wife kept joking about them being ""clone dreams"" because, at that point, we were trying to go along with what the movie was telling us. Trying. But we both knew she was right. Right in that being what the movie was going to say they were: memories of Jack's life before he was cloned by the aliens. Seriously? This isn't the 80s anymore, and we already knew in the 80s, even in sci-fi, that clones don't get the memories of the being they were cloned from. The memory flashes work if his mind really was ""wiped"" before his mission, but it doesn't work as some remnant from his genetic donor. It's just dumb. Why can't we seem to get past this stupid idea that clones have the memory of whatever they were cloned from? (And, again, I just have to point out that Star Wars does not do this, the only sci-fi clone movie I can think of that doesn't fall back on that tired idea.)

Also, the drones, which can follow Jack's ""DNA trail"" (really? we leave a trail of DNA in the atmosphere even when we're in an enclosed, airtight vessel?) have a problem with his voice identification and consider killing him more than once. I suppose they can't sense his DNA when he gets too close. That's only a long-range thing. (Do you sense the sarcasm there?)

And there's the bit where the drones are flying through the human hideout blasting everyone into cinders but, when one of them corners Jack's wife, Julia (introduced only to be a princess-in-the-tower character), and a bunch of other humans in a dead-end corridor, it pauses and decided to scan them. Again, really? The drone, programmed to kill humans, suddenly needs to stop and scan them? For just long enough for it to get exploded from behind, of course.

And, after all of that, we're not even up to the stupidest part of the movie. I know! I see your jaws hanging. The stupidest part is when he finally flies up to the alien ship, this huge, upside-down pyramid thing, and it's just full of vast expanses of space on the inside! When did this become a thing and what kind of sense does it make? So, yeah, he's flying through this huge space and, every once in a while, he has to fly through an opening in a wall, and the walls are covered in clone pods. The only other things in the huge alien space ship are drones. No aliens. And, when he finally gets to the center to arrive at ""Sally,"" it's just another inverted pyramid thing with a flashing (talking?) red light. NO ALIENS! So tell me why they needed to take over the Earth and use it as a source of material for their fusion reactors IF THERE ARE ACTUALLY NO ALIENS? And, if that's all they needed, why didn't they just stop at any of the unpopulated planets on the way into the solar system? Wouldn't that have been so much easier than having to fight a bunch of humans for the materials they wanted? AND WHERE WERE THE ALIENS?

There was also an even more stupidest part. The part where somehow the flight recorder from Jack's spaceship from when he first got captured by the alien ship went from being in the command module, recording what was happening, to being in the sleeping quarters of the ship even though the sleeping portion had been jettisoned. Because that makes all the sense.

The acting, though, wasn't bad. Not great but not bad, either. And the tech was decently cool. But there was a reason (many of them, actually, as I've pointed out) the movie didn't make back its production budget domestically. So, unless you just have to prove to yourself how dumb the movie is, this is not one I could suggest to anyone.",1384732800,9,7062,4.454756380510441

The rendering of a post-apocalyptic earth afflicted by nuclear winter is strangely beautiful, as is the way in which the story is presented.

The plot was decent, but wasn't anything too exciting...most of it was predictable.  The visuals and special effects were well done, and the drones were pretty neat.

2286481,3,B0009ESTDW,"This film relays heavily on an intriguing story line. This approach works well - you are around half way through the film before you can really start to understand what is going on and have a feel for the plot line. This movie doesn't move particularly quickly, and the slow methodical approach defines the film. The graphics and the world they create are pretty incredible. Despite the graphics and special effects the winding plot makes the movie more thought provoking than many post apocalyptic Sci-fi type movies. I enjoyed the acting as well. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a repair technician tasked with repairing drones on a largely decimated planet earth. His character evolves the most throughout the film. Morgan Freeman also play and interesting role.

The bottom line is that this was an average film. I enjoyed watching it but I will not be in a hurry to watch again. The plot dragged at times and the ending was not satisfying in my opinion.",1383868800,,956,4.793939393939394

There's no obvious villain for most of the movie, so some people may find its pacing slow, but it has wonderful layers that it peels back throughout the story.

Is it a flawless script, or a masterpiece? No. Are there are times you may say... yeah I've seen this before, yes... but it's been so long. Enjoyable and beautiful. I highly recommend seeing this on a large screen with popcorn and a moment to take it all in. Clean and crisp visuals leave you thinking about this world and it's imagery long after the movie.

I gave it 5 stars because I really enjoyed it and my time away. Is it really a 5 star movie? No, but judge for yourself. It's well worth a watch if you don't mind a slow movie. Enjoy!",1383436800,,739,4.309352517985611

It's not a movie short on emotion or dialogue which is unique to find in a modern day holywood Sci-Fi flicks that usually have shallow plots with CGI galore.

2286516,4,B0009ESTDW,"Despite some of the bad reviews, this movie is good enough for a second or third watch.  One, to have a better understanding of the plot. You need to listen to everthing that Jack (Cruise) narrates to understand what happens at the end and why everything is not what it seems.  Two, the plot is good, it is original story with some likeness to other scifi with similar apocalytic last person or people on Earth plot.  However, I had not seen this story repeated in another movie.  You don't have to be a sci-fi or Tom cruise fan to like this one. What I do like about this movie is that its not about the origins of man like other sci-fi movies of the past decade. Oh, Morgan Freeman, enough said.  :-)",1383264000,,702,4.287878787878788
2286517,5,B0009ESTDW,"I just can't say enough about this movie.. And couple that with the fact that I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan and I think that Morgan Freeman phoned it in and is currently over-saturating celluloid.
I think that it's just a combination of all things comprising the whole which knocks my socks off. I love the minimalist art design, The muted colors of the environment and the structures create a unified colour scheme that helps to bind The imagery to a common thematic thread.  And while it does have this mono-chromatic feel, It never comes across as forced, but rather the natural result of the devastation left behind and the soulless reconstruction of the 'man-made' structures. And the cinematography beautifully and deftly aids in its execution.
I found the story both fascinating and quick to get its point across without becoming a clich action movie.
The direction was spot on and flowed perfectly.
And last but not least the music by M83 perfected what was an already visually beautiful film.

If I had to give one very minor nitpick it would be that the whole human underground subplot felt like it wasn't as smoothly incorporated into the film as it's other elements.

I'll even swallow a little pride and say that Tom Cruise pulled off a brilliantly understated yet very convincing performance.
 Not that it has anything to do with anything at the end of the day, but I hear that he was served his divorce papers if not at least signing them while he was on the shoot. Nothing like a cold, hard shot of reality to temper an actors performance. In my book, the man's stock raised quite a few points from the bottom where it had come to rest over the last few years.
I've heard rumors of people Coming away from this movie with ideas that it is purveying a Scientology dogma, if not in a subtle metaphorical way. I didn't see that at all but then I don't think I had any kind of agenda going in except to enjoy what looked to be like a really good movie. I think that this observation ,in many instances came from people going in ultra-aware of Mr Cruis' past with the dubious organization. Idk.

All I can say at the end of the day, is that in my opinion,  this was a fantastic science-fiction movie with a great story, great imagery, fantastic music and very competent acting. Directed in such a way that the movie seemed to end almost as soon as it had begun, as it was such a blast of a ride.",1383264000,4,2406,4.481735159817352

2286522,5,B0009ESTDW,"A couple of things that stood out:

Several times throughout watching the movie, I caught myself admiring the continous ambient music. The background music and gorgeous scenes blend together and perfectly enhance the dystopian / dream like feel of the movie. I also really enjoyed watching a movie without the blood and gore we usually see in SF movies these days. The only thing that did not convince me was the idea that Jack's clones were used as a ground attack force. Made little sense. The machine with the drone technology and anti-gravitational devices may need Jack to keep everything in place, but to conquer the planet?

2286524,4,B0009ESTDW,"The movie ""Oblivion"" is a great movie to relax with if you are a post-apocalyptic science fiction fan. It starts out appearing as a story about a man/woman salvage team trying to gather resources from the destroyed earth to take with them to their satellite home where the last of humanity lives and then going to one of Jupiter's moons to restart civilization.  However appearances can be deceiving and it turns out that the world is not what it seems and they are not what they seem.  As the story goes on many secrets are revealed as to how the world was devastated and how Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) was involved in it.  I enjoyed the special effects and the action but one thing  made the film less enjoyable to me.  It was obvious at a certain point how the plot was going to resolve itself and the required happy ending was not that satisfying.

I thought it was decent, nothing all that special, but still wanted to check out the commentary and deleted scenes. The production company made a special ""rented"" version that does not allow for the viewing of special features. How selfish have studios become that they force you to spend $20 on a movie you have already paid for for a single viewing? I found that to be incredible ridiculous and I hope my review will be just enough to knock that rating down for this movie.

Then it comes back, but it goes away after a few seconds, and as far as I can tell, it's like that throughout the disc.

I don't have a cheap Walmart $30 player, I have a Sony BDP-S5100 that has no problem with any other disc. Evidently whoever authored this disc didn't do a minimum of quality control. It doesn't seem to me like the disc itself has a manufacturing problem, or I would have had problems playing the movie itself.

2286552,4,B0009ESTDW,"I'd heard many terrible things about this film before watching it, almost enough to make me not bother, but I'm a sucker for sci-fi blockbusters so I gave it a try. The good news is that it's not a bad as I'd heard, the bad news is that while it's reasonably entertaining it's far from a good film.

At its heart this is an Independence Day type of affair and while it tries to take itself more seriously any purists watching it would be cursing the poor science of it. Unfortunately it's not as much fun as Independence Day either, however it's more modern visual effects do provide some stunning scenes.

The story is simple, aliens attack Earth and are beaten off with a nuclear attack that irradiates vast regions of Earth, rendering it unihabitable. Most of the survivors ship of to a colony at Titan, but two stay behind to protect essential assets needed to support the far off colony. Remnents of the invading aliens still survive on the Earth's surface and are trying to hamper the operation.

Things aren't quite what they seem and the story really unfolds from there. It's fairly predictable as to where the story is heading, but the journey isn't too bad. The cast all do a reasonable job with their roles, but there's nothing inspired about any of it.

Some folks complain ""the story was slow"" - I think the operative word here is STORY (it actually has one)!
It was refreshing to see a well made movie in which the special effects contribute / go hand in hand with the story, instead of simply trying to overwhelm you with what can be done with CGI, and overloading your senses in the process.

BTW-his flying contraption was pretty darn cool!

If you think it's slow, simply watch when you're in the mood for something ""slow (er)"".
Personally, I didn't think it that slow (enough action and edge of the seat scenes), but if you're simply looking for an overloaded CGI smashfest, mebbe so?

2286559,2,B0009ESTDW,"It is hard to nail down where this movie went wrong; you have A list actors, a great story line potential, what looks like a great budget - and nothing comes together.

SPOILER ALERT:
Story Line:  Its hard to tell a good story within the attention span of most people today, but the ending of this movie was so predictable that a 3 year old would have demanded their money back.  I mean seriously; this is the best you can come up with?  Next time hire a 6th grader to polish off the ending, at least they could have through up something 'as good.'

Actors / Talent : I hate projecting 'roles' on actors, but in all reality we expect things from certain actors - I will admit they can surprise us and do other things well, we just didn't know, but it is a rare surprise as well.  Tom Cruise as a cowboy space jockey just didn't work - just drive a stake through my chest, it would have been more entertaining.  Morgan Freeman was almost believable in his role, but once he tried to be the action hero guy he fell on his face as well.  The 'female' talent was obviously selected for the T&A bling quality of who will show the most.  The rest of the forgettable cast we never got to know enough to care that they were wiped out.

Visuals: Of course a talented CGI department and great camera's are about all you need now a-days to pull of great looks; there is no real disappointment with that in this one.  Huge ocean sucking reactors and flying space drones were about the best part of the movie: but that can only eat up so much time.

If they had spent as much money on the writers as they did on the rest of the crew to make this movie, they may have made something worth watching - but given the chance to watch this movie again; I will hit TV-Land for a rerun of Captain Kangaroo.",1382745600,,1785,4.202346041055718
2286560,5,B0009ESTDW,I really liked this film; The critics have said there was nothing new and that it had all been done before one way or another....which may be true but the quality of the production; the timing of the disclosers; the movement of the film; the soundtrack the visuals and the ability of the actors to bring out emotional reaction with very little dialog involved...was superb...The timing in the film is excellent and comes across smooth as glass...which is enhanced by the visuals and music. The one part in the film that I thought production timing broke down was where Jack and Julia were at the cabin and A Whiter Shade of Pale starts playing in the background...I thought that Julia should have looked a little more sheepish and guilty and Jack a little more regretful and insecure but otherwise I thought it was a good choice of music and songs. This movie should be used in Film class to show how Visuals; Music and timing can enhance an otherwise mediocre script for a movie and make it come out great and spectacular..Also I was very impressed with most of the acting involved particularly Andrea Risenbough who I thought played her character to a tee...You really need to see this movie in Blu Ray with a high quality surround system and as large a screen as possible to experience this movie as its meant to be seen..watching this movie on your I-phone is just not going to give you the experience that you need in order to evaluate this movie correctly....if the critics had loved this movie and given it praise I might have only given it a four start or three star rating; but because The critics had given it such a low rating I was shocked when I finally saw the film and was drawn in...I had to get this movie hence this review on the Blu Ray....,1382659200,,1759,4.517241379310345

I instead received an inferior blue ray product that will not fill my entire screen on a 2012 Samsung PN64E8000 3D HDTV as though it were formatted for 720p pixel resolution or less. I also used a 2013 Sony BDPS7903D Blue Ray player which was also formatted properly. This Oblivion Blue Ray purchase is not True High Definition as per today's standards. This is a 2013 movie so apparently the Blue Ray provider did not think filling up your entire screen was important. When I called Amazon to complain about this conundrum, the customer service representative was courteous but she had never heard of this problem, but I let her know in detail, how my HDTV screen and player was formatted correctly and that other Blue Rays perform fine but not this Oblivion Blue Ray. I don't think it is a defect because I found another Oblivion movie version advertised on Amazon with the letters ""HD"" printed at the top of it's Blue Ray jacket. I suspect some kind of fraud by the Blue Ray manufacturer until I get a full explanation from someone. Amazon did offer to look into the matter but Amazon never contacted me back on this.

While the action was strong and the acting solid, the concept floundered towards the middle.  At times I felt as if I were watching a high tech version of Legend (Will Smith) but in the end, the antagonizing force left a bit to be desired.  I would place it somewhere between iRobot and Legend for quality and watchability.  For true Tom Cruise fans, this is a decent watch.

Tom Cruise was his usual self; you know what you're going to get with him. Morgan Freeman seemed to be tossed in for his name. His role was pretty small. I thought the human opposition forces could have been developed more fully. All-in-all, I enjoyed the movie.

Every ""plot twist"" I called before it was revealed, and I'm not the type of person that is able to do that very often (I didn't figure out the twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" until that was revealed). Now in no way do I fault the actors for this, I think they did the best they could for the script that was handed to them. The visuals in this movie were BY FAR the best part, they were amazing. However it doesn't quite make up for the lack of depth in the story for some very important parts of the movie and for the tedious manner in which they showed other less important parts.

I'm still trying to decide if I keep this movie or give it to someone that is only interested in how visually stunning the movie was...",1381708800,,821,4.163522012578617

Aside from the usual lack of common sense and story holes, I think Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman both made this movie better than it would have been if lesser stage presences were used. The special effects were very good and the story itself was Ok. If I've seen a movie in a theater - I will buy the Blu-ray if I loved it (i.e. Star Trek Into Darkness) , I'd probably  watch it on PPV if I really liked it (World War Z) , or not watch it again (i.e. Thousands of movies - Most recently Elysium). In this case - Maybe PPV if nothing else was on.",1381622400,,712,4.049645390070922
2286656,4,B0009ESTDW,"I've read some rather pointed critique about this film, however I found the film entertaining and although they sometimes ""give the plot line away"" in still delivers a couple of decent twists and surprises. There are precious few decent sci-fi films today, so against this sad background I found Oblivion to be a refreshing and positive experience. The story is plausible and the pacing is good. Tom Cruise may be a wacky person off-screen but he continues to deliver some very credible performance in exactly the way that Bruce Willis does not (try watching ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" to see how far Bruce has fallen from his ""Twelve Monkeys"" days). So kudos to Tom Cruise, the supporting cast, the story, the photography, special effects and the Director for pulling off a complex film. I've watched this film 3 times and it still pleases - few films do that for me. I find techno-trash films like Prometheus to be depressingly stupid - Oblivion was a really nice surprise by comparison.",1381536000,3,987,4.777777777777778
2286657,5,B0009ESTDW,"I remember a reviewer who wrote a very positive review of the Sci Fi film 'Soylent Green' by saying something like 'it's a fine line between campy schlock and a profound film'. Oblivion straddles this line. There's also a fine line between a film that is derivative and one that 'pays homage' to films that have come before it. Oblivion rests there too. There are also one's out there, I suspect, that are not sure what kind of film they want to be. 'Oblivion' resists easy categorization. It has romantic and fantasy elements throughout the film. The viewer never knows where the film is leading to. With Jack Harper's memories being erased, and Earth's past something we grow increasingly unsure of, the events make a good mystery. Oblivion ends up being a feel-good experience of the highest caliber. As loose ends of the film are tied up in improbably ways, the film goes more into a mode of fantasy. As the events become more unbelievable, or at least unlikely, the film becomes more dreamlike. This could seem like a cop-out on the part of the filmmakers, but I enjoyed the film perhaps even more because of it, or because of the way it was done. I've come back to this review *spoilers ahead* and I must ask, how can the film have such an upbeat ending when there's no water left on the Earth? Was the fantasy at the end meant to literally be a dream of a doomed Earthman?

Oblivion reminds me of an old Outer Limits episode titled, 'Hearts and Minds'. An episode where human soldiers find themselves fighting an alien enemy, or at least an enemy they believe to be alien, when in reality they are fighting other humans - other humans who have been led to believe they are fighting an alien enemy. The film makers may have examined this other work of art before crafting this one. The most startling line to me in the film is when Jack Harper is getting ready to fly into the forbidden 'radiation zone' and when asked what he will find one of the humans says to the other, ""he will find his destiny"". This is obviously taken from the original Planet of the Apes film where one ape asks another what 'Taylor' (Charlton Heston) will find inside the forbidden zone and the ape replies, ""he will find his destiny"" or simply ""His destiny"". It's probably the second most memorable line in the film after ""Get your paws off me you damn dirty ape"". The line makes no sense other than 'go out and find your destiny' until the end of the film or until the second viewing where it becomes obvious that the ape knows in the forbidden zone Taylor will discover he's on planet Earth and his destiny is to be replaced by apes. There was really no need to have a 'forbidden zone' inside the Ape film except perhaps to add mystery to it? It does bring to mind, are the apes so racist they will outlaw travel to half the continent over fears apes will discover they are not the pure 'firsts'? In this film we never really learn what is inside the radiation zones for Jack Harper decides not to go into them other than flying near. One might wonder in hindsight if he would find huddled remnants of a dying humanity but we never discover what is there. For whatever reason, perhaps film length, this is a plot development that goes no where and we are treated with something else to interest us instead.

Oblivion owes it's greatest debt to the recent invasion movie 'Skyline'. One where humans face an impersonal, and really unseen, enemy. An enemy who has us fighting ourselves, in a sense. I think the mimicry of so many of these general human themes or archetypes works out in a good way. The familiarity of the subject matter, combined with the uncertainty of where the film is going, move the audience even more. Notice the uncertain relationship between the subservient Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his female superiors, including the female head of NASA, as we are exposed to this film supposedly taking place in the future. It's a mystery for us to ponder. Then we can't help but notice the strong Southern accent of this bureau chief, even as we discover Morgan Freeman is somehow her enemy and we're not yet sure why. We only ever see this one NASA chief, 'Sally', always wondering what is behind her, something that is never really resolved even at the end of the film. Yes, obviously it is not really this NASA chief we are seeing but only a facade set before some kind of alien intelligence that is mimicking her. The most likely guess is that this may be some kind of automated enemy. Certainly a very cold one, at the least. It might be interesting to compare Sally to the computer villain 'HAL 9000' in the film '2001 A Space Odyssey'.

I really liked this film and was moved by it. I give it 9 out of 10 stars. I liked the love affair within the movie, too. I must admit to not being an unbiased viewer.",1381536000,,4809,4.481185860889395

2286668,2,B0009ESTDW,"I rented Oblivion twice. Both times, I fell asleep during the movie and during the first rental, I waited too long to resume watching before my rental period expired. So what made me rent it a second time? I thought surely the movie would get better as time went by if I had remained awake. Sadly, it didn't.
I won't review the premise of the story. There are several other reviewers who have done a much better job with that than I could ever do. What I am going to tell you, should you care to read further is that I rarely rate a review. I may rate a movie with the ""star"" system but I have done this only rarely. In fact, the last movie I felt compelled to express my two cents about was ""Legends of the Fall"" if that tells you anything. And for some reason, I find myself comparing these two movies over and over again although the stories at first glance could hardly be more alike.

Both movies have incredible cinematography whether it be showcasing real nature and it's amazing, jaw dropping beauty in ""Legends of the Fall"" which was filmed with such an incredible eye for detail that took your breath away as only Kevin Costner's films, ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""Open Range"" have done for me since or the talented mix of the sparse but visually compelling landscape of parts of Iceland with the special CGI effects mixed in that are showcased in this movie.

Both movies also showcase the equally gorgeous actors, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise who in and of themselves are equally pleasing to look at if only they had exercised some of their acting skills in either movie to offer us an enjoyable movie for other reasons than just the scenery. In each movie, the main characters acted by the above mentioned artists are acted which such stoicism despite the journeys their characters take that good looks aside, it makes the movies hard to watch for any other reason other than the total visual appeal. If not for their costars in each movie there would be no redeeming acting value.

If you like CGI effects for the scenery, you will enjoy this movie. If you're looking for something to entertain you otherwise, do yourself a favor: skip this one!",1381449600,,2152,4.512820512820513

It is one with a good story, a story with ups and downs, but overall it weaves everything together nicely by the end.  I do feel the ending was rushed.  Considering the movie length I cannot say I am surprised.  They could have shorten some of the bits in the middle to allow for a more composed ending in the style of the movie.  It was like they had to wrap it up and the did the best that they could with the time remaining.

The acting was on point, the visuals were great.  I actually felt for the characters.  I was really interested in the universe that was being created.  That could be the reason I felt the ending was rushed.

I can always count on Tom Cruise 1.running fast 2.riding fast on a motorcycle. 3.fighting against the MAN and somehow winning in the end AND getting THE girl.

The computer in his house on the table is from Minority Report, the helicopter in the canyon fighting drones is Star Wars Episode IV, His wife injured in the desert from The English Patient, the library scenes from War of the Worlds, sand people from Star Wars IV, Tom Cruise running fast from...well, every Tom Cruise movie ever starring Tom Cruise.

2286693,5,B0009ESTDW,"I confess that the negative critics kept me from experiencing OBLIVION on the big screen and the mentioning of an ""alien invasion"" didn't exactly stimulate my appetite for Joseph Kosinski's hors d'oeuvre (IMHO, there is only one thing that alien beings might find interesting about our planet, and surprisingly the film got that right dead-on). But fortunately one of my friends insisted that I ""wanted"" to see the film and he was right.

Many critics claimed that OBLIVION was supposedly derivative and built on sci-fi tropes. I couldn't agree less. Joe Kosinski was never cagey about OBLIVION being an homage to the science fiction films of the 1960's and 1970's (PLANET OF THE APES and THE OMEGA MAN come to mind) and used elements and ideas from these works. But here he created something completely different, original and fresh out of these (and never at the expense of the original work like the shameless ""copy and paste"" of BEN HUR's chariot race in a highly anticipated movie from 1999), resulting in a film much larger than the mere sum of its parts.

On the contrary, Kosinski uses these elements and ideas as subtle hints that appearances are deceiving to tell a science fiction story in the best tradition of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, renowned for its unsuspecting story turns and twists. By the end of the film it should be abundantly obvious that the drones were neither inspired by Pacman or WALL-E but rather by a remote-controlled device in one of these films from the last century.

Admittedly, watching the film for the first time reveals what appears to be a couple of plot holes but basically these are necessary evils not to give the surprising twist away. Watching the film for the second time and from the inevitable new perspective things start to make a lot of sense and Olga Kurylenko's acting, now that audiences can fully understand what her Julia character must have gone through upon her awakening, is quite impeccable and reveals how skillful Joe Kosinski uses body language (something I had already admired in his previous film TRON: LEGACY) to tell what's going on inside his characters.

OBLIVION is presented in stunning vistas and in a cinematographic style that takes the time to tell the story without the hectic pace that often plagues contemporary movies. The Blu-ray looks fantastic, the level of detail and textures is remarkable, colors are natural and the sound design is impressive, giving the drones a unique personality and language (their ""I require assistance"" beacon sound will get quite a different meaning during the course of the story...).

The film is enigmatic and thrilling during the first viewing, much clearer and evident the second time, and if you still require insight there's Tom Cruise's and Joe Kosinski's inartificial audio commentary for the entire length of the film. If you buy a film on video disc for repeated viewing, experience and enjoyment, then OBLIVION is most definitely my Number One recommendation during these days.

If you're looking for fast-paced sci-fi action comic-strip-style I'd say that the latest STAR TREK reboot movie will be more to your liking. OBLIVION has plenty of good action scenes and visual eye candy (and can do without gore) but here these don't cover up the lack of an original story but rather serve to tell one that's good, thrilling and fresh. It's a passionate accomplishment I found incredibly entertaining and rewarding.",1381190400,,3427,4.9825174825174825

2286698,5,B0009ESTDW,"I had no plans to follow through with this movie. Lately every movie I've been waiting to go to DVD has let me down. The previews rock my world only to find I can't sit through fifteen minutes. Grrh! Oblivion had a couple things going for it before I even pressed play. Science fiction and Tom Cruise. I live for end of the world survival drama and Tom's been one of my favorite actors since Legend.

The movie starts off with a 12 Monkeys vibe because the opening scene is a glimpse of the past. Tell me you all saw that movie. It is one of the best of all time. The pacing is slow with long looks and minimal dialogue, but the tech is sleek and sexy. Everything is white or feels white, clean, even the ruins, but then darkness and unknowns are thrown in, which is the least flashy way a movie can create conflict and I loved it. Quiet spooky stuff. Then the music came into play, and I was thrown into a Terminator vibe. Very futuristic everyone is going to die via machine kind of way. I loved it! I was completely creeped out. Tom played one of his most subdued roles ever, almost funny at times. Morgan Freemen excels at that and he did here too. There's a mystery to be solved, humanity to save, and the last man on earth to get laid. Okay, Tom's not the last man on earth, but here he is getting some and the world has ended! That was a little too much, but at least it was very understated, which pays respect to how sci-fi movies should be. Except when it comes to the modern version of Battlestar Galatica. They had the best sex scenes.

4.5 stars for Oblivion and I'm sure I'll watch it again because it's that cool. One more movie vibe reference. Wall-E. Weird, but let me know if you see what I'm saying here.",1381104000,,1723,4.218181818181818

The picture quality of this BD is stunning!  The sound quality is uber-fantastic if you have a DTS-HD Master Audio A/V receiver with a 7.1-channel surround sound system.

I liked Cruise in this a lot, he does an excellent job of carrying the story with believable acting.  His co-stars added a lot, both the two women and Morgan Freeman.

It's a 'big' sci-fi story that's captured in less than two hours, would be interesting to see more backstory from human survivors/'matrix' perspective. Would've definitely liked to have seen more of Morgan Freeman's excellent acting in this, there was undoubtably a lot more that we could have seen had it been in the script.  Overall editing/dp/scriptwriting was compelling, well shot. The lake scene provided perfect green contrast to the white/silver mech home that Cruise's character works from.  Engaging and well done, without a lot of constant explosions and split-second jumpcuts that characterize other modern sci-fi movies, this one's well worth watching. A sci-fi gem that gets you to actually Think (like Vanilla Sky did), in a good way.  Nice work - well filmed, written and acted.

1. It's a sci fi and it needed more visual appeal as a Sci-fi should have. The only futuristic thing in this movie is the bike, his ship, the drones, his gun, the alien mothership, and the facility he lived in. I wanted to see more explosions, more scenery, and more technology. This brings to my next point. If he's in the future and he's flying an alien technological ship, why would lightning affect its system? Here's another question, where in the hell did Kara the alien triangle come from?

2. It lacked action. If you're going to create a movie where it's mostly story, make it worth watching from beginning to end and I wouldn't care about action. BUT, because this has more story then action it is obvious that it needed to deliver more ACTION. (Hope that makes sense)

2286719,3,B0009ESTDW,"***spoilers possible***
Tom Cruise really needs to start picking roles that don't require the name ""Jack"". In this one, he's Jack Harper, a tech sent around to repair drones. The movie is set in a post-war future where ""we"" won but the earth was nearly destroyed in the process.

Our hero ends up teaming up with the last vestiges of true humanity and fighting for the freedom of the planet. The dream scenes are kind of a stretch as are some of the major plot points, but if you consider that most science fiction things are farfetched, it becomes reasonable.

There were plenty of times in the movie where I just wanted it to get to a point, but overall, it's an okay sci-fi flick.

The patrols of a future Earth in which the people have been taken away for their own safety after a nuclear battle against space invaders involves some memories that have been sanitized.

2286771,3,B0009ESTDW,"For a Sci-Fi movie that included Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, I guess I was expecting better.  The visual effects and stunts were great.  The basic story line was pretty good too.  There were aspects where I was lost until I watched it again and watched the deleted scenes and behind the scenes featurettes.

The pace was slow in several parts of the movie.  In fact, I had to watch it in two sessions as I fell asleep through the first time I watched it.  And I made it further along than my wife had and she loves Sci-Fi flicks as well.  Yes, we had been tired but a good Sci-Fi would keep us riveted regardless.

I would buy it if you love Sci-Fi fans as it is a good story.  If you are on the fence about it though, eh, watch some Warehouse 13.  A nice fun, Sci-Fi channel series that is funny, exciting and takes a new direction every couple of episodes.",1380499200,,861,4.195121951219512
2286772,5,B0009ESTDW,"I have been a science fiction fan since I was small and there are certain sci-fi books and movies that are on my roster of all-time favorites (Matrix, Terminator movies, 2001, A Space Odyssey, Minority Report, Avatar, Doctor Who (I'm a Brit), Neil Gaiman, Asimov books, some Heinlein, Ender's Game are a few that come to mind) and Oblivion has joined the list.

In my view, it's a highly aesthetic film with a good story and good acting. To me a movie like Oblivion is what movie making is about: good plot with a story you can't guess (not sure what the critics' comments about being derivative were about, I have read and seen plenty of sci-fi, and the story had me surprised), good CGI and effects, great, original accompanying music, good acting and some amazing, breathtaking scenes; like the protagonists' home in the sky and their swimming pool suspended amongst the clouds; the sweeping vistas of a post-apocalyptic earth (with a tip of the Empire State building showing) and flight scenes between Manhattan streets-turned ravines.

Tom Cruise did a great job, he was believable and charismatic at the same time. The other actors, less well-known to me by name other than Morgan Freeman, acted their parts well and believably. Thanks to the Oblivion team for bringing a truly great science fiction movie to the screen.",1380412800,,1326,4.8628318584070795

2286774,5,B0009ESTDW,"I really liked this film in many ways. The cinematography and special effects were spectacular and the acting was very good. Tom Cruise doesn't alway impress me in films with his acting but in this film he did a good job. I just love Morgan Freeman and he helped this movie with a strong performance. The entire cast actually did a good job. I actually liked the plot of the film and it made for an interesting storyline that was entertaining.  It had enough twists and turns to keep you thinking.

I think the film was much better than many people give it credit. I won't go into any spoilers but the film is worth watching at least once and for the special effects maybe even twice. It is an interesting Sci-Fi story.  This is the reason I watch movies.

I do wish that there was more interaction with the invading aliens and that part of the storyline could had been enhanced and it would had made the film even better. For me the film was about a 4.5 but since that rating is not allowed I will make if a 5 star. I would watch it again.",1380412800,,1040,4.237373737373737

Tom Cruise played a robot-like clone, not unusual considering most of his characters are faceless emotionless blobs in recent years.  Last time he played a character that I liked was in Interview with a Vampire, so I wasn't surprised at the lackluster performance in Oblivion.  Everyone just seemed to walk from one scene to the next, feeling nothing and portraying NONE of the emotional hell that the situation would call for had it been real-life.

I am astounded; as graphics increase, acting ability decreases on the same scale.",1380412800,4,661,4.9818181818181815

What an utter disappointment those were, however Oblivion is probably the most realistic and probable SiFi movie to date.  After reading some of the reviews I was a little skeptical and wasn't expecting much, but the movie was well worth my time.  Actually I purchased the movie and will find it rewarding to watch at a later date.  Not 20 times mind you, but worth watching again or even a 3rd time because it's a thinkers movie.  I really believe that's why some of the other reviews are so low... These are people who are fans of action, gushy romance and having everything ""told"" to them.  No real thinkers in MHO.  The HD experience and visuals are breathtaking and even Tom Cruise's performance was refreshing.  Realistically most movies are 4/5 stars as there are always problems/errors with a concept, plot or technical aspect of any movie, but Oblivion deserves 5 stars because of so many 1 star ratings that I can't for the life of me understand.",1380412800,,1095,4.545918367346939

Great effects, good acting, good plot, good climax, and it left out the emphasis on the more sobering parts with Morgan Freemon-I'm grateful for that since it would have taken the movie into a more Mad Maxx/Book of Eli direction.

2286821,3,B0009ESTDW,"When you have seen as many movies as I have you tend to become jaded. You wonder if an original blockbuster-type movie will ever be made with genuine effort and a non-ironic purpose, especially in the sci-fi genre. You fear the day will never come. It is nice to be proven wrong.

Oblivion is not a fantastic movie by any means. It has its problems. There are some inconsistencies and goofs here and there, but you can tell from the first few minutes that genuine thought and effort was put in to this movie, and that more than makes up for its other issues. There is a style and an atmosphere to it. In a time when green-screen rooms are substituted for real sets so often that you begin to worry for the livelihoods of studio carpenters, here is a film which ""feels"" real. These are sets and locations that, though parts of them were C.G., there was a seamless blending with the real that is a treat for computer weary eyes.

Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a technician responsible for the maintenance and security of huge reactors that supply power to off-world colonists. Earth has been nearly destroyed by an invading alien force and, though humanity won the war, the planet is a wasteland. This is explained by a helpful (if annoying) voice over/scroll at the beginning of the film. Jack's only company is his communications officer Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) with whom he occasionally gets frisky. Their memories are periodically erased to protect vital off-world information in case of capture by the remnants of the alien force which they call ""Scavs"". In spite of their memory wipes Jack has flashes of his life from before the war, which worries him because the war ended sixty years ago, well before he was born.

His companion tells him to focus on his work and not to worry. After all, they are leaving for the new colony in two weeks and they don't want to ruin their chance to rejoin humanity. The work continues as usual until an encounter with the Scavs and the discovery of a crashed spaceship shake everything Jack thinks he knows.

From here we would enter into spoiler territory, so I will dispense with the exposition. Suffice it to say that what follows, while not perfect, at least shows true effort at the writing, acting, directing, and effects levels. The actors really care about what they are doing and it shows. Tom Cruise, of course, can only play Tom Cruise. His range is limited, but here it is well used. The mystery of the plot, while a little predictable, at least doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. In a limited fashion the movie brings up questions about what it means to be human and what our purpose really is in the world. Though these issues are not delved into too deeply, it was nice to see them actually dealt with and not just used as cheap set pieces. The set designers and the director take care to create a world we can dive into and almost touch and taste. The sterility of Jack's base really contrasts with the grittiness of the devastated world below.

The only items I would change are relatively minor. One is the opening scroll/narration. Opening scrolls may have been cool in Star Wars a few decades ago, but now they are a little dated and annoying. They are especially grating when read aloud to us and doubly so when you divulge the exact same information with dialogue not too long after. The other change would be to distinguish between the female leads physically a little better. Because of the washed out color scheme of the movie it is hard to tell the two women apart at times and it gets distracting. Is that her? No, wait. It's the other one. The fact that the two women are usually in different styles of clothing and in different locations helps, but it takes a while to get there.

This is a movie well worth the effort put into it. It is good sci-fi with good execution and no franchise to prop it up. The studio went out on a limb by not playing it safe and finding something to reboot or a big name to tag a sequel onto. Here's hoping this movie gets a lot of attention and maybe we will see more of its kind in the future.",1379980800,,4107,4.520861372812921

An excessively convoluted plot follows him back and forth from the surface where he's variously perplexed, shocked, challenged, accosted, duplicated, killed, and restored, finally to an idylic existence in a quaint, green little country setting with the girl of his dreams, in a way that will leave your head spinning.

2286871,5,B0009ESTDW,"I very much enjoyed the slow reveal of the mystery in this film, and Tom Cruise did a fantastic job as he struggled to understand everything. The world building was as perfect as Minority Report, and the action was heart-pounding.",1379548800,,230,4.775
2286872,3,B0009ESTDW,"**No Spoilers**

Nothing about the movie engaged me, and I was never more than mildly entertained.  The setting and characters alike are too detached from anything I could really care about.  The acting itself is fine, but the character development seemed lacking and stale.  The characters as a whole never feel human, but cold and callous.  For myself there were no major plot twists or revelations that surprised me, in fact I had the majority of the movie figured out midway through.  In the end I was left wanting more - character development, robust story, action, almost anything.  The best part about the movie is the visuals and CGI - these are quite stunning and done incredibly well.  Overall, the movie is about the survival of humanity, but the film feels very far from anything human or real to me.",1379548800,,812,4.75
2286873,2,B0009ESTDW,I had high hopes for this movie but it was not very good.  The story was hard to follow and very little character development.  The ending was okay but predictable.,1379548800,2,164,4.433333333333334

2286882,3,B0009ESTDW,"This sci-fi thriller unfolds like a novel, with a deliberate pace, each revelation building upon the other. Jack Harper is part of a two person team left behind on a desolated Earth after a war against an alien race. Mankind has relocated to Titan. Jack and his partner's job is to maintain the drones that protect the power generators sucking energy from Earth's oceans to power life on faraway Titan. Neither Jack nor his partner have a memory more than five years old, but Jack is haunted by dreams of a previous life, dreams that focus on a beautiful woman and visions of Earth before the war. Soon we begin to see that all is not as it seems.

Despite the measured pace, the stunning visuals hold your interest: visually this film is a triumph. There are enough big action scenes to keep it exciting, although the movie begins to look familiar in parts, paying homage to Star Wars, Independence Day, The Matrix, and any post-apocalyptic thriller you've ever seen (I'm talking about you, Mad Max).

This movie requires you to think and remember in order to understand the final revelations, so if you aren't the sort of person who likes puzzle movies, you might want to avoid this one.",1379462400,4,1189,4.6571428571428575

2286893,4,B0009ESTDW,"This film is a fairy tale and I guarantee you it will end well. But it is also a patchwork of plagiarized elements.

The earth was destroyed, a destruction caused by the destruction of the moon by some not really specified cosmic war. The earth then turned into a wasteland submerged by tons and tons of dust, earth and rocks. The ruins are thus underground. The Golden Gate Bridge is reduced to two pillar tips sticking out of that dirt. That's a rewriting of H.G. Wells the Time Machine.

Two humans are living in the ring of satellites that overlook the waste land with a company of drones that are supposed to destroy all signs of life. Jack Harper is the man and the woman is supposed to be his wife. Jack Harper's memory has been erased to enable him to carry out his mission. Total Recall, second episode, the sequel. Everyday Jack Harper is supposed to go down on the surface to revive the drones that have been downed in the night. There is thus some kind of hostile life on this planet, living underground of course. That's Star Wars revisited. An underground resistance has been so often used that listing all the plagiarized connections would take many pages. That implies at this moment that the surviving humans who have fled the decaying planet are controlling the situation from some distant artificial planet. That is a black star like in Star Wars again. But who are these escapees?

But memory-deprived Jack Harper knows where there is a secret valley that is as primeval as the Garden of Eden. There Jack Harper has a cabin with electricity and a pile of vinyl records and a record player and all kinds of heirloom  and he plays his records everyday when he manages to escape from the control of his ""wife"" on the surveillance satellite. The drones have never found that place. I guess Jack Harper's lost memory was not lost completely and the drones are not very swift.

Then one day a spacecraft crushes on the surface and there are four or five sleep-boxes with hibernating human beings in them. This spacecraft was called by a strange signal from the underground resistance. The drones are destroying the sleep-pods. Jack Harper saves one and takes the woman inside to his satellite base. The reaction of his official wife shows there is a real problem there. When he takes the woman to recuperate the ""black box"" of the space craft they are captured by the resistance and then things become iffy.

Let's have one more trip ""Back to the Future"" and then we have two Jack Harpers and maybe or maybe not two women and this saved woman (or her and her double) is revealed to be Jack Harper's real wife, two real wives and two real Jack Harpers. Then the initial Jack Harper recuperates some kind of memory. With the help of the resistance under attack from drones, he realizes that he has to fulfill the mission the other Jack Harper - but that is him in a way, at least if you accept the concept of doppelgangers - and  his wife were entrusted with: to destroy the black star.

Officially one of his real wives is hidden in the secret valley, the other one is set in the sleep pod that is going to be delivered by one Jack Harper to the black star with a bomb in it. When he finally reaches his destination, o divine miracle, the wife has been swapped and replaced by the leader of the resistance who is dying of a wound gotten in the last battle against the drones. But the bomb is here, Jack Harper is determined and the final an massive attack of drones against the resistance is under way.

What will happen? A happy happening and glorious ending of course. The black star crumbles, the drones are grounded, the resistance is saved, the wife has a child and two or three years later the surviving Jack Harper reaches the secret valley with the resistance and we are in a Grimm-like ending when they are happy ever after, ever after Snow White's step mother dies dancing in red-hot metal shoes.

If you like soft horror fairy tales, rush to this one. Otherwise entrust it to your children who might have soft nightmares in the night. You will have to cuddle them with love.

2286894,2,B0009ESTDW,"I had heard it called a live action version of WALL-E which isn't a 100% accurate. Tom Cruise has a way of leaving his mark on his films that drive an otherwise interesting bit of material into banal mediocrity and this movie is no different. It has some very nice cinematography with aerial photography of the dystopian future. Story-wise, it has a sort-of-interesting hook that is revealed near the end but it's way too little, too late. Watch it if you have NOTHING else to do.",1379462400,,480,4.593023255813954

It was easy to leave and go get something to eat without pausing the show.  If I can walk away without pausing then I probably won't watch it more than once.  Some movies you can watch 20 times and not get tired.  This one is not in that category.,1379376000,,359,4.057142857142857

I think some people may ding the movie for the ending, but honestly, it was slightly different and not completely predictable Hollywood formula.",1379289600,,440,4.317073170731708
2286905,5,B0009ESTDW,"Actually, Tom Cruise has come back to Earth (in real life) and his being cast in a Sci-Fi movie occurring right here on earth is quite appropriate. But I love a good Sci-Fi movie and this one is pretty good. It evokes emotions like 2001 Space Odyssey. Beautiful. You don't like the acting? What are you comparing it to? Its Tom Cruise. Hey, he does all his own stunts, convincingly. He's no J. Nicholson or A. Hopkins but he's not a bad actor. I'm glad he's come back to reality (again, in real life). You think there is too much CGI? Too Digital? Again, what are you comparing it to? Are you sure you knew you were watching a Sci-Fi movie? Actually if you watch the ""Making of"" on the blu-ray it explains there is a lot more ""reality"" in the movie than you might think and less CGI. But its a modern science fiction movie. CGI is required to tell the story, but I think this movie is a perfect balance. The drones are the coolest, even though they are villains. I love the noises they make... kind of like R2-D2 on steroids. The score is fantastic. You can watch the movie with only the score playing. That's a little weird, but the score can probably stand on its own if you are into just listening to a movie soundtrack by itself. One question I have about one of the characters, Vika, is why are her eyes so dilated all the time? It is spooky looking. Why I am writing a review of this movie that hundreds of people have already given their dumb opinions of, I don't know. Just thought I would offer mine because I liked it so much. Besides the movie, the ""making of"" is a very interesting documentary. Its in 5 parts and in HD as well. Its almost as good as the movie itself. I own the blu-ray and the video is of outstanding quality. Can't comment on the audio since I have not watched it with surround.",1379289600,3,1809,4.261627906976744

2286909,3,B0009ESTDW,Overall this is an okay movie and both Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman make it worth watching.

2286915,5,B0009ESTDW,"I rented this since I am a Cruise fan and pretty much see all his stuff automatically. After viewing it, I bought the blu-ray--I knew I would want to see it several more times. While I actually liked the story, I was particularly drawn to all the sets--the house in the sky, the pool, the earth landscape, the cool plane he flies, even the drones. I found it easy to become immersed in that world....which made the actual story less important. Watching the extra features greatly enhanced my enjoyment as well. A LOT of work went into making this movie look the way it does. Five stars all around from me.

Edited to add: I notice that a lot of reviews are complaining that it was too digitized and too many special effects. How ironic that the producers would go to such lengths for realism (as shown in the extra features).....and they were so successful that the assumption is that it's all fake! The vast barren earth scenes are real, shot in Iceland. The scenes out the windows of the sky house are actual photographs of clouds and sunrise/set, projected onto a 360-degree screen surrounding the house (no blue or green screens).

Just some guy living his life when, OH NO, he's framed for stealing the knock list, he's framed for a pre-crime, aliens invade, Cameron Diaz can't handle a one night stand, someone is trying to steal a battery, etc.

(note to self, get bigger TV) I'm not going to delve into character development or cinematography those things are really not what I'm looking at. I'm looking at was I able to reasonably suspend disbelief and did I get drawn in by the characters and the plot. This movie ticked all those boxes.

122 people gave it 1 star - that must just be a lot of people who hate Tom Cruise. There is no way this is a one star movie ...I mean I don't think I even gave Prometheus one star and that movie was truly stupendously awful...oh wait, yes I did give it one star. :)

Watch this movie, I enjoyed it, I think you will, too.

2286930,5,B0009ESTDW,"I expected another over-the-top ho-hum shoot 'em up/blow 'em up Tom Cruise sci-fi romp.  Instead, this is a well-thought out and masterfully executed effort that is strongly character driven, romantic, and a spectacular audio visual experience. It is absolutely incredible to watch on the big screen.  The sound mix is near perfect because you almost never think about it. It concentrates on immersing you in the story rather than taking you on an amusement park ride.

Cruise delivers, but the female leads also deliver moving performances. I highly recommend that you watch the extras on the making of the movie, and watch it again with the running commentary where director Kosinski and Cruise give you insight and nuance to the story and its twists.  From this, it's clear that Cruise just does not phone it in; that he was deeply immersed in the success of the project. They also discuss how many of the amazing visuals are much more ""real"" than we would anticipate in this green screen age...which accounts for much of its impressiveness.

There are a lot of flying sequences which are all extremely well done. If you watch the behind the scenes extras, you'll find out how they did it. The in-cockpit effects with the actors are the best I've ever seen, and as a former fighter pilot, I can tell you that it adds exceptional realism physically and in the influence on the actors' performances.

I agree that the visuals have an entirely different experience depending on the size of the screen you watch. This movie was designed for the big screen, and there is depth to detail that just cannot be seen on the small screen. Close-ups of actors are deeply immersive on the big screen because of the insanely sharp definition and depth in actors' eyes due to the cinematography and new HD camera and lenses. When emotion is high, this becomes an amazingly powerful tool in this film.

2286934,5,B0009ESTDW,This movie was very suspenseful. It kept me guessing on what was really going on. I actually was very surprised at the outcomes. It was not predictable.,1379203200,,152,4.666666666666667
2286935,4,B0009ESTDW,"This movie is 'high' Sci-Fi, as opposed to 'low' Sci-Fi.  What this means is this :  It's meant to provoke you to think and ponder the prospects of the story's scenario.  Therefore, it's a GREAT Sci-Fi for true Sci-Fi fans, whereas, it may not be well suited for someone whose expecting your normal Tom Cruise type action movie.  Though it has really good action, it's more a Sci-Fi drama than an action movie.  The effects and production value are TOP NOTCH.  The director was very good, as was the acting.

The movie kind of leaves you hanging with all sorts of unanswered questions, and, for me at least, this is not a bad thing.  I was left wanting to know more about what happened before the movie's time frame, as well as after.  In fact, I'd bet that if they did a part 2 based on what occurred BEFORE the movie's time-frame, it'd be great to see !

The robotic sentries in the movie actually stole a few scenes they were in...they were truly well depicted, and, for the first time an any film I've seen, a robotic presence actually felt scary...scary because incredibly capable, tough, and ruthless.

Don't hesitate to see this movie.  Cruise does a great job, and his character ends up being quite complex and human.  The effects are beautiful to behold.  In fact, this movie is a pleasure to behold because the lighting and effects are at times staggeringly beautiful.  No cheese in this movie.  No filler either.  I only wish it could have covered a bit more terrain in relation to its core conception of story and related events.  But I'm not complaining.",1379203200,4,1567,4.575539568345324

2286938,2,B0009ESTDW,"I missed Oblivion in the theaters so today I got a RedBox rental. According to what I've read, and the rental dvd menu, there are special features but none of the three versions sold at Amazon list anything at all!
I sometimes find the extras to be the best part of a movie purchase and ""Oblivion"" would be one of those for me.

Visually interesting but with endless plot holes such as contamination concerns (but you never saw Cruise taking any precautions- except an ordinary shower when he got home). What's to be concerned about? Earth was destroyed but various structure still stand, maybe buried under a LOT of soil, but standing- yeah, right.

I think I figure out the alien angle before it was revealed, stupid aliens usually did a sloppy job of tracking Cruise- almost laughable.

I may buy a copy someday, there is a visual appeal if you check your brain at the door, but I'll need some of those extras I've heard about and I don't see them here.",1379116800,,956,4.514450867052023

2286950,3,B0009ESTDW,"I was expecting so much more from this film, but since it let me down so much I won't spend much time with it.

I'm a Tom Cruise fan, but this is not one of his better films.  It's okay--Tom Cruise  being Tom Cruise in a lackluster walk through of the movie.  I think he saw the boredom of the story at hand, but was anxious to collect his paycheck on the way out.

The story has potential, but this was not fully realized by the screenwriters.  After  a while I found myself saying lines before they were said and predicting what would happen next.  Nothing too original here.

Set and effects were okay, but we've seen it all before in better films.  Fairly dumb action sequences.  This is a film with a lot of gaps in logic where some things occur to show technology of the future, but then don't work later to show how heroic our hero is.

I won't discourage anyone who is a sci-fi fan from seeing it, but I'm not going to say it's a must see.  I would have been better off watching something else on this movie night.",1379116800,,1022,4.17948717948718

2286957,3,B0009ESTDW,"I've never been a fan of Tom Cruise but the man can act. Oblivion is a good example of that. It started amazing: the plot is fresh, new, innovative, nothing we've seen before. I was extremely thankful for the novelty factor. The visuals are highly engaging and well done. The pacing is just right. Not too slow, but it also doesn't jump right in without any information on the background.
I won't discuss the plot because others have done that already. Let's just say, it's worth buying the DVD. I know I'll watch it again in the near future, not least because the acting was outstanding and the twists were nothing I expected.
What I didn't like was the ending. It was too...much. I won't say what it is so I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched the movie but I wish the directors/producers/writers didn't go overboard with it because it could have been a five-star movie.
Still enjoyable though and a solid three stars.",1379116800,,929,4.568862275449102

I am just not much of a Tom Cruise fan though. I find that the characters he plays could pretty much be played by any leading man type of actor. But when he is the actor I find it hard to take him seriously and he never really becomes the character for me.

Instead I tend to think of him saying to himself in his head ""Well that dangerous stunt that I just did myself was really manly of me!"" and ""People will really think of me as a manly man now!"" And then I will usually notice the actors that are taller than him.

Hugh Jackman, Gerard Butler, Daniel Craig, Guy Pearce, Chris Hemsworth, Channing Tatum, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Vin Diesel, Matthew McConaughey, Mark Wahlberg any of these guys or whoever your favorite male actor is could've played Tom's character.

2286967,3,B0009ESTDW,"I am a big Sci-fi fan and took so long to see this film because I cannot stand the lead actor Tom Cruise which is the main reason why it lost a star.
The other star was lost because CGI does not make a film alone you still need a great story and characters. I presume the expenses of the CGI caused the subordinate characters to be under developed. Their roles could have enhanced the illusion and emphasized the turmoil within the lead character.
Poor box office attendance seems to reinforce that the viewers need more story to back the CGI.",1379030400,,543,4.3861386138613865

This is a thinking man's science fiction flick...not only is it visually stunning with some nifty CGI special effects, it also has an intelligently written script, with dialogue that is ofttimes poetic, as the opening quote exemplifies. Set in 2077, 60 years after Earth is invaded by alien beings called Scavengers (Scavs), who destroy the Moon, resulting in a tectonic upheaval, that - combined with nuclear weapons, used to defeat the aliens, have resulted in Earth becoming virtually uninhabitable. The remaining humans inhabit a huge space station and have established a colony on Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. Cruise as Jack Harper, is Tech 49, who is responsible for patrolling the radiation-free sections of Earth and for maintenance of drone warships that hunt down the remaining Scavs. He is assisted by his communications officer and lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). At the end of one of his patrols, the Odyssey, a NASA spaceship crashes and in the only survivor is a mysterious female, Julia (Olga Kurylenko). But things are not exactly as they seem. Be prepared for some surprises, beginning with the appearance Julia and Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) who leads an underground stronghold of...humans. Produced, directed and written by Joseph Kosinski, he gets triple credit for its excellence.

2287000,4,B0009ESTDW,"There was nothing that really jumped out to make this movie stand out against many of the other space movies, but its still an enjoyable story.

2287002,4,B0009ESTDW,"Wanted to see this in the theaters but missed it.  Only bought the Blu-ray because we have our own theater now.  Otherwise, I probably would have stuck with just DVD.  Also, it wasn't much more than the Blu-ray by itself.  As a bonus, the price went down from the time I pre-ordered it, and got some money back.  Anyways, back to the movie.  The quality is good.  The CGI is very transparent with the only borderline effects being those scenes with the water reactors in them.  The film is cut together well with the story flowing pretty seamlessly.  Overall, a well executed production with good acting.",1378857600,,604,4.622641509433962

2287008,4,B0009ESTDW,"For some reason this movie instantly reminds me of Ray Bradbury and his book ""The Martian Chronicles"". Now I know the story is nowhere close to what Bradbury was portraying, it was just the spirit of how this story unfolds. The special effects were great and I found this movie to be entertaining all the way through. If you enjoy a good sci-fi end of humanity story then this is the one for you.

2287012,4,B0009ESTDW,"While not a Tom Cruise fan, I found Oblivion to be a film that engaged my mind and raised questions of Identity and the nature of what it is to be human. If I disregard the rather schlock ending, I must say that I enjoyed the film. The points raised were nicely nuanced and not presented in such a way as to cause blunt force trauma to the viewer.",1378771200,2,347,4.043478260869565
2287013,2,B0009ESTDW,Many recent blue-ray movies no longer have a time icon letting you know that the movie is loaded. This is one.  I waited 3-4 minutes and the movie didn't start.  I assumed that something was wrong with the media.  The next movie did the same thing.  You will really need patience with this movie. I had the same result on two different Blu-ray players.,1378771200,,352,4.453125

2287017,4,B0009ESTDW,I like the movie but only as far as the sci-fi end of it. Story is way out in left field. Special effects are good and Tom Cruise is likeable. Still trying to figure different angles of the story..why who did what and such. Type of movie you have to watch more than one to figure out what really went or is going on.,1378771200,,316,3.953125

2287019,3,B0009ESTDW,"This movie is engaging but not riveting. It took too long to get to the most interesting part.  Even then, the consequence of the revelation was not pursued deeply enough.  The sequel should be better, if there is one.",1378771200,,218,4.564102564102564
2287020,5,B0009ESTDW,"This is the best Sci-Fi flick I've seen in recent memory. Great plot, action, theme music, etc. Its the type of movie you think about the next day and want to talk about with your friends. I'd tell you more, but I don't want to spoil it.",1378771200,,237,4.0638297872340425

2287024,5,B0009ESTDW,"I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters, but it would have been well worth it. I was a bit confused about the plot towards the middle, but once things cleared up, i was captivated by it. I watched it twice!",1378771200,,212,3.953488372093023
2287025,4,B0009ESTDW,"Not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I am always up for a good Sci-fi movie.  Would have liked to have seen more of Morgan Freeman, but Tom Cruise was good and it was overall a pretty good show.",1378771200,,188,3.8205128205128207
2287026,5,B0009ESTDW,"I'm a 3D animator and I really like movies like this as they inspire me. I do a lot of photo real work and the effects in Oblivion are flawless. There is also a very interesting bonus feature about the making of the pods that they fly around. The acting and storyline are strong but that's a subjective thing and especially fragile with sci-fi movies. Say what you want about Tom Cruise's personal life, but I find him a believable character actor and do enjoy his performances. And, how can you not like any movie with Morgan Freeman, although, his role is pretty small.

Good story, spectacular effects and fun movie.",1378771200,,619,4.576576576576577

2287029,4,B0009ESTDW,"Loved the special effects, though the basis for the story could have been better explained.  I was disappointed though in Morgan Freeman - one of my favorite actors of all time and he was barely in the movie.  He played an interesting character who could have used more development.

2287037,5,B0009ESTDW,"This movie surprised me because it was a mystery/Sci-Fi mix. I found myself looking around at my family to make sure they were as impressed as I was. They were.

Be sure to try to spot the props from Tom's other movies. The aviator glasses from Top Gun, the flannel shirt and ball cap from War of the Worlds, and a very familiar looking toy named ""Bob"".",1378771200,,353,4.268656716417911

2287045,5,B0009ESTDW,"Why are the dreams so vivid yet not reality?
Why must mankind leave the Earth even though the alien invaders were defeated?
Why are the murderous Scavs suddenly interested in capturing Jack?
As the movie progresses with spectacular special effects (Jack's home, Jack's aircraft, the drones, the buried cities), the answers to the mysteries are slowly revealed to Jack.  The story is told through Jack's eyes and his emotions are almost directly felt.
Some of the answers are truly surprises.  These lead to even bigger puzzles, especially for the audience.
Overall the movie was great entertainment with great visuals, music, a thrilling story.
The back-story of the aliens and their invasion of Earth is sorely needed to completely understand why things are happening as they are.  This is for another movie though.
Oblivion is just a played out slice of this future time.",1378684800,,873,5.090909090909091

2287048,3,B0009ESTDW,"This film started out great and it looks great. If it only had a plot or gave some hint of why a big triangle rock in space would want to kill all the humans on planet Earth. Why would Morgan Freeman and a band of rebels dress up like the Predator? Because the space rock in the sky sent out droids to kill humans and Scavs. Why wear the sweaty helmet? The clone thing was odd. So, Jack and his copilot on the space mission let the passengers escape when they flew into the big space rock. They must have been the only ones ever to make it because the space rock cloned them. Then sent them out to find downed droids on planet Earth. This movie is pretty to look at but, it left me with a lot of questions. If one clone gets blown up am I really happy another clone comes back? Jack loses his copilot/dispatcher for droid repair but finds his wife from his Earth life. He moves on rather quickly. Then she returns the favor by going through the original Jack, one clone, and another clone at the end. Kinda crazy.",1378684800,,1013,4.173469387755102

2287052,5,B0009ESTDW,"I read a few of the reviews before watching this movie, and I almost did not watch it. I am glad I did. I read that the plot did not make sense. I think the plot makes perfect sense, and is interesting as well as ingenious as well as sweet. I will make one small criticism: the perfect home and machines that the 2 humans live and work in seem too perfect to be true ( but I think that the alien tech entity could easily maintain them ) Another small complaint: we are supposed to believe that this fantastic technological entity still needs humans to repair some of the machines ( I believe that this is probable, just look at our own world, machines are always breaking down ). And one other small criticism: We only see one small group of survivors ( actually, I prefer this. Some movies, like the matrix, try to show too much and thereby become less interesting ). So you see that all my criticisms actually are not criticisms at all. This story is solid, well told, moves along swiftly, and is continually interesting. Even the schmaltzy parts are perfect. There is one small but important scene which cries out for the perfect soundtrack song. I found myself thinking that this would be the perfect place to play A Whiter Shade Of Pale... and it plays!!!! The inevitable ending has two ( TWO ) surprises that actually took me by surprise. I felt warm and happy and satisfied.",1378598400,,1381,4.440944881889764

Also, the video and audio quality is top notch which enhances the enjoyment of this movie.  Both Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman were very good but IMO, it's wasn't their best work but the movie was still excellent on all levels.  You don't have to be a scifi fan to enjoy this movie because of the storyline.",1378598400,,435,4.468354430379747

2287058,1,B0009ESTDW,Not worth the money at all. Tom tried his best but it wasn't his film. Got tired of watching it about halfway through because it started to get a bit repetitive.,1378598400,5,161,4.225806451612903
2287059,5,B0009ESTDW,"Everything in this movie is perfect. The music is amazing, the actors are perfect for their roles, the storyline is astonishing and surprising, and the movie itself is so visually stunning.

In the year 2077, aliens attacked earth. They were defeated, but earth was completely destroyed. Rome, London, New York City; all lie beneath hundreds of feet of sand and rubble. The TET is collecting survivors for transport to one of Saturn's moons, Titan. Jack and Vicka remain below, handling logistics and repairing drones and hydro-reactors that are converting the earth's oceans into energy for the colony in Titan.

That's all I can tell you; you have to watch the movie. It is so incredibly well put together. The storyline holds you in suspense and mystery for a very long time, and the climactic scene is simply epic. I cannot compliment this movie enough.

However, the ending is a bit disappointing, so just stop the movie about 2 minutes before then.

This is a must watch, a true epic, and possibly one of the best movies of 2013.",1378598400,,1035,4.797752808988764

2287061,5,B0009ESTDW,This was a smart science fiction movie and Tom Cruise delivered a stunning performance.  I tried to see this move when it was in theatrical release but never found time to go.  I would have like more plot development concerning the aliens nemesis from outer space but other than that I think this is a worthwhile movie to invest 2 hours.,1378598400,,337,4.508196721311475

2287071,4,B0009ESTDW,"Finally, a science fiction movie that is unique and entertaining.  It misleads you a few times so that it can throw some interesting twists your way.  The revelations are truly weird, and the ultimate enemy of mankind is strange enough to leave you with a bunch of theories.  That's all I'll say.

The movie has a mix of tense action scenes, interesting futuristic living scenes, and discovery scenes that thoroughly entertain.  The acting, settings, visual effects--all are astounding.  You WILL immerse yourself in this futuristic world.

The movie is an action-packed futuristic love story thriller set on a ruined planet with robots, aliens, and a couple other weird things.  How can you go wrong?  Worth a buy.",1378598400,4,715,5.042735042735043

This story focuses more on the love story and some of the complexities introduced by future technology.  This one has several surprises, not just the spooky stuff in a dark ruin.  It's got enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat, while the love story smolders in the background.  I won't tell you any of the details, but I was very pleased they found a way to end it on a hopeful, positive note.  Nicely played !",1378598400,2,497,4.24468085106383

I almost feel sorry for the film critics because a great steak is never as good as the first time.  Objectivity can be lost due to familiarity with the film industry.  I urge the critics to encounter each movies as an excited opportunity to read another good novel! I loved the fact that despite the efforts of advance alien A.I. entity could not quinch the human spirit!  I the relationship that the main character that Tom Cruise displayed for his sufficient other was noteworthy.  To find that one soul mate is rare but you know when you do find the one! Ladies don't dismiss this movie due to the Sci-Fi and technilogically aspect.  Listen to it with your inner ear and your heart.  I am a former Marine but this movie touched me.  Reminded me of why I put my life on the line for the livelihood of others.  It was a modern day cowboy movie.  The ranger or homesteader is pushed to his limites to protect his land, his family and his livelihood.  Good for you Tom.  I would take you to war anytime.  I know in this film you would have my back!  Siempre fidelis - John Wayne would be proud of Tom's character,pilgrim!  I rented it twice from Red-box and will buy.

2287084,5,B0009ESTDW,"I have not read the reviews before watching the movie. This might not be the wisest move but it worked for me. The story turned out to be so standard that it was not hard to guess each step and the end. However that does not distract from the fun. You might even want to watch it again to see the subtle clues and not so subtle clues.

I was surprised by the mix of actors. Seeing Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman playing virtually the same characters that they played in many movies saved time in trying to figure them out in the story.

For the technical, I only saw the Blu-ray version. Blu-ray is no longer unique but they also did not have to create extra CGI to show it off.

The story:

 It is after the war (Earth vs. aliens) naturally we won or you would not be seeing the movie. However the Earth is a goner and everyone moved to a move of Titan. The effective team of Jack and Victoria are cleaning up the last of the oceans needed for their new home.

Only Jack seems to see some inconsistencies in his life and mission. Slowly a truth is reviled. Jack may be pressured to take sides and act.",1378512000,,1101,4.145539906103286

2287088,3,B0009ESTDW,"SPOILER ALERT! I start by stating that I like Tom Cruise in science fiction (see ""Minority Report"") because he is not being ""Tom Cruise,"" (""I must protect my wingman."").  The premise was interesting enough, and begs the question,""If you were the only one in the Matrix, would you care?""  The bleak scenery espouses the isolation the characters experience, and the technology is believable future tech, but the acting lacked passion.  Perhaps the casting of the clone wife with someone with an upper crust British accent and attitude could have been done with someone with more personality. Also, the fact that she too is a clone was a bit disappointing.  If she had been in on the deception, there would have been more suspense. But in the end, she had no control over her own behavior. It is only Cruise's flawed cloning, which leaves him with a thread of residual memory that nags him at night that something is rotten in Denmark, that opens the door to a resolution.  In this aspect of the story, I would have liked to seen more told from the scavenger's perspective.  All we know is that they took ""decades"" to find the ship with Criuse's real wife orbiting in stasis, but how did they know he was having memory dreams, and that the sight of his lost love would 'awaken the sleeper'?  We assume there were at least 52 clones, obviously necessary to cover the Earth.  Perhaps they captured one.  It would have nice if Mr. Freeman's character had told us, as Morpheus told Neo of the first person to escape the Matrix. In the end, Oblivion was an pleasant diversion, but not one I would repeat.

2287105,3,B0009ESTDW,My husband and I rented this movie last night for a nice night in.  We love SciFi and action movies.  Oblivion left us sorely wanting.  The plot was convoluted with obvious inconsistencies and unfortunately far from believable even with the suspended disbelief that is a given with most SciFi. The action was fine. The acting was passable. The effects were above average. But sadly as a whole the movie was maybe a C+. I'm sad we spent the money on the rental.,1378512000,,460,4.585365853658536

2287109,4,B0009ESTDW,"An Earth laid waste, debris and dust al around with one lone technician doing what he can to keep things running.  No, not Wall*E, but Tom Cruise as Jack (Tech 49) repairing the drones left behind to protect giant energy convertors, all that is left of use on Earth.  In this, Tech-49 is aided by Andrea Riseborough in their austere home in the clouds.  At the start of the movie, Jack is clearly more philosophical troubled by what they do than she is, but this is overshadowed by a greater disturbance in their routine when Jack finds a survivor, played by Olga Kurylenko, which forces Jack to reassess all he knows about his mission.
First off, the design is just fantastic.. it's a beautifully detailed world, a believably scorched earth in contrast with their sleek minimalist modern living environment.  It's clear that throw cushions and terracotta are not in fashion in the future.  Also, the director Joseph Kosinski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tron-Legacy-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B004K4IZ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tron: Legacy (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>) has once again used a contemporary soundtrack which manages to be both epic and modern adding an energy to the movie that it might not have had with a more conventional symphonic score.
Tom Cruise never quite escapes being Tom Cruise, making it hard for us to invest in his character, but Andrea Riseborough more than makes up for it with a character so buttoned up that her expressions of emotion need only be the slightest of moments to make a great impact - it's a great performance.  Kurylenko never feels quite at home in her role here, but passes muster.  Morgan Freeman - well, who can say that watching Morgan freeman isn't a pleasure, but he is hardly stretched in what turns out to be quite a minor role.  Great entrance though, which focusses on his distinctive voice before he is revealed in person.  At the end of that short monologue, Freeman says `Lights' and the greater picture is revealed... and that sort of sums up the direction.  After every moment of characterisation, we swiftly move past to reach a reveal of some greater plot or art design, which sort of shows you where the director's heart really is.  He's more interested in the big ideas, than where his characters are coming from or going to.  Many of those ideas in the movie are not original - you get the feeling in the movie frequently of `Oh, that's just like in the movie `insert movie here'.. (it would be churlish to name the movie references and spoil the fun of finding them for yourself).  However, it's been put together in such a stylish way and with such conviction from the director, that it's a success.  Ultimately it's good to see stylish thoughtful sci-fi gracing the big screen, and I for one give it a thumbs up.",1378512000,,2837,4.970401691331924

2287141,5,B0009ESTDW,"As a rule, I hesitate to watch any film that features Tom Cruise as the lead character, not only for his personal life headlines, but because of his poor acting skills, in my opinion. But being a lover of sci fi, I reluctantly decided to give Oblivion a try, and found myself extremely entertained.  The suspense is sustained throughout the entire movie, and needless to say, the special effects are absolutely riveting.  Tom Cruise continues to score wonderfully entertaining movies that excel despite his presence.  Definitely worth viewing.",1378339200,,543,5.1477272727272725
2287142,4,B0009ESTDW,Good movie visually fresh. I do like this type of character driven science fiction where the technology is treated as every day life.,1378339200,,133,4.826086956521739
2287143,2,B0009ESTDW,"Boring

The shockers in the narrative are expected and there are way too many moments in the film trying to convince us that Tom Cruise is the hot charismatic leading man he once was. I like Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise movies, but this movie just started to feel embarrassing. Shirtless shower scenes, young woman half his age luring him into swimming pools with cheesy music ques as they whisper sweet nothings to each other. What was the point of this movie again?

If you've seen a science fiction movie in the last 25 years, I promise you that you've already seen a better version of this movie.",1378339200,,597,4.518518518518518
2287144,3,B0009ESTDW,"Decent science fiction film. Tom Cruise is *not bad*.  The rest of the cast is pretty good. Plot wise it was interesting.

My only gripe is that Nikolaj Coster Waldau aka The Kingslayer wasn't in more scenes.",1378339200,,208,4.594594594594595

2287147,2,B0009ESTDW,"The underlying story is interesting and I suspect the book was probably pretty good, but the movie spends 80% of its time focused on Tom Cruises's character's patrol flights. Some cool effects, but most of the movie is just Tom and his outpost partner patroling the planet. Morgan Freeman is maybe on screen for 15 minutes. So some good eye candy with the effects but no character development and minimal plot.",1378339200,,410,4.788732394366197

2287155,4,B0009ESTDW,Good action movie. Tom Cruise was good in this syfy thriller. The concept was one that has been used many times but this one has a different spin on a familiar theme.,1378339200,,166,4.21875

2287161,5,B0009ESTDW,"I don't know where all the negativity is coming from, unless it's just because Cruise is in it. The movie was entertaining, visually beautiful, and tugged at the heart strings a bit. Overall, what more could you ask for? If you're too brainy to enjoy this film, then you ought to be brainy enough to know you should be looking elsewhere to entertain yourself.",1378339200,,359,4.625
2287162,4,B0009ESTDW,"I thought this was a great sci-fi movie. The graphics were awesome, and the storyline was great. Acting was very decent also. One small beef I had with it was I found it a little slow at places, but that could really have been down to the minimal amount of characters and the emptiness of the stes - not a big issue at all, but the only reason it's getting 4 not 5 starts. Well worth a watch.",1378339200,,392,4.038461538461538
2287163,5,B0009ESTDW,"I was completely engrossed by the movie's story line, acting, special effects and music.  I rented the movie one night and found I couldn't get it out of my head for many days afterward.  It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it was captivating with just the right amount of action.  Everything appeared so real and the drones were down right creepy, especially with the sound effects they made at appropriate times.  I really enjoyed the nostalgic elements that keep Jack longing for days gone by, and the music that accompanied that stirred some memorable chords within me as well.

This movie was so good that I felt compelled to watch it again a few days later.  I purchased rather than rented the second time, because I'm sure I'll be watching it again at a later date.",1378339200,,786,4.539007092198582

2287168,4,B0009ESTDW,Story has holes in it but considering the quality coming out of Hollywood lately it was a least entertaining. Morgan Freeman's part was small although his character still had a strong impact on the story.,1378252800,,204,4.857142857142857

  I was left confused and may have to watch it again to see what I missed.  We watched it segmetedly as we have a 19 month old.  The movie was interesting and some of the action got my heart racing, but I would not necessarily compare this to something like Minority Report.

I like Oblivion because it is a movie that speaks to the viewer about the spirit of man, the very essence which drives us to do what we do. I think that Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman turned in some very powerful performances in this movie, and so I think that my movie collection is a little bit more improved now just by having this one added to the collection. It's a decent sci-fi movie, so I think it can be enjoyed by anyone, even those who don't necessarily care about sci-fi movies.",1378252800,,555,4.346153846153846

2287184,5,B0009ESTDW,"I feel like this movie paralleled the new Tron movie in the relationship between entertainment elements.  The story was developed enough to be interesting and somewhat engaging, while the visual and sound effects took center stage.  The acting was also believable and lent just enough uncanny-valley atmosphere (without actual humanoid robots) to make things feel uneasy and like there was some sort of facade.",1378252800,,410,5.390625

2287189,2,B0009ESTDW,"Tom Cruise needs to relearn how to act.  He has a set of stock expressions and responses, and that's it.  He's so full of himself, you can never accept the character he's trying to portray.  All you see is the bad acting.  Without him, this movie may have had legs.",1378252800,,265,4.24

Visually stunning and good story-telling...and, at times, very familiar...he subtly and not so subtly pulled in many of his favorite bits from other movies, characters, scenarios.

Amazing what she has gone through in life from poverty in the Ukraine to a modeling career and now a very good actress. I have seen the film 2 times so far. Will wait to watch it again some time.

2287204,3,B0009ESTDW,"This was a confusing movie, Tom Cruise must have needed some cash flow.

There is some action, love, and the classic sci fi twist to make it better than just okay.

It could have been a little more descriptive about the aliens but that being said, I must say I really enjoyed watching the movie....even the second time around.

2287216,5,B0009ESTDW,"As others have said the cinematography is outstanding. Be sure to watch the extras on the DVD/Blu Ray for the authors inspirations for making this movie so visually stunning. Unfortunately the plot is a little thin and there are hints dropped throughout the movie that makes you question what's really going on. By the time we see Morgan Freeman you should have figured out who the scav's really are before there actually revealed. There's a sprinkling of many other sci fi themes in this movie, but I've never seen any movie without their flaws and plot holes. Sometimes you can ignore them, sometime you can't. As stated earlier the real star of this movie are the visuals and special effects. You won't get the complete story until the last 15 minutes of the film so watch it to the end.

There's going to be an Oblivion 2 that will take place before our civilization was destroyed that will offer more answers. From what I've read it going to be a prequel.",1378252800,,960,4.614035087719298

2287218,4,B0009ESTDW,"My husband and I enjoy sci-fi, and so we enjoyed this post-apocalyptic film, in which Tom Cruise plays a pilot assigned to earth - along with his companion/flight operator/wife - to maintain drones and eradicate any remaining rebels, as the few real survivors of the earth's destruction are now living off-planet. His discovery of a sleeping survivor in a pod crash who, once awakened, claims to have been asleep for 60 years and to have known him before, causes him to question all he once believed. Tom Cruise is excellent - he is best in these intense end-is-near kind of roles - and the images of the destroyed earth are absolutely enthralling in a can't-look-away kind of way. However, the story twists and turns a lot, and we weren't always sure we were exactly following every twist.

Integrating all this info gives about a 3.5 to 4.0 out of 5 stars. I am a sci fi fan, so I appreciated the rather slow start to this visually arresting movie. The plot is OK, but it does not take long to figure out what's going to happen if you've seen enough sci fi flicks. Special effects were very good also. I found the ending kind of ""fakey"" and somewhat abrupt however. Would these smart aliens/extra terrestrials/or their intelligence or computer technology not see what's coming ahead of time? After all, they tricked the earth and its people into becoming a wasteland, thereby feeding their technology and energy needs years ago. Overall, it was worthwhile watching. Just slow.

Overall the acting is good, the plot twists keep you wondering what is going to happen next and the science fiction isn't too hard to follow. Throw in a love story, hope for humanity and it is a good, entertaining movie.

Having seen the movie now, I see some parallels with Stargate with a little bit of Matrix thrown in. There are a few holes once you're done watching the movie and you have time to analyze it.

A Great movie for Tom Cruise. The Ukrainian-born actress Olga Konstantinovna Kurylenko as his real wife has the on screen chemistry that makes the movie perfect. A five star surprise. I wish that John Carter or Jupiter Ascending had been cast this well. I went back and changed my original rating from 4 to 5. I have also been playing the entire soundtrack and purchased the DVD.

This movie was gorgeous on Blu-ray. Special effects were stunning. I was sitting here during the movie trying to pick out all the Earth sites that I could identify that weren't totally destroyed. Sound quality was super. Subtitling was done well (I'm partially deaf and it makes a huge difference to me in the enjoyment of films I watch).

Plenty of on the go action with a few twist and turns to upset the story a bit as to make you think. I rated this an A grade plus for sheer entertainment that keeps you on your toes as to not knowing what is next. The story is out of this world and very different, to explain it's a bit hard as not to give away all its plots so now its up to you to go get it and have a look.

Set in the year 2077 after Earth has become uninhabitable, Oblivion is visually stunning and has a compelling plot line that held my interest throughout the entire 2-hour drama.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the very limited amount of violence and strong language, since our 6-year old daughter decided to join us on the couch for most of the movie.

2287269,2,B0009ESTDW,"I've admired Tom Cruise's work for years, his films are always well produced and entertaining. BUT OBLIVION is an aimlessly talky movie which seems purposeless and confusing, TC's acting is fine, though subdued. I wonder if shooting in Iceland froze his typical enthusiasm.

Why did he agree to participate in such a pretty yet bland project?

I have a theory: TC seems impulsive and on occasion a victim of his own raving enthusiasm. According to OBLIVION's 'Making of' Feature, TC was shown a graphic novel of Oblivion to illustrate the movie's potential/look and was blown away. And so signed on. The graphics he saw were indeed good. As great as the movie isn't. The 'Making of' feature has Cruise and company swooning over the design of eating utensils, chairs, costumes, imagined ships and stations. So, in a decorator haze he must've green-lighted the production. If he saw a script and read it, he must've been glowing in that initial haze, or he fell asleep.

Oblivion's plot and Dialogue, in today's parlance, simply suck. Acting is
numb and occasionally dumb while the the entertainment quotient slurps.

I saw another recent TC film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-Reacher-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B00AS1Q8FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack Reacher (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>. It's Great. Smart, sophisticated plot, dialogue, acting and action (TC's martial arts are especially real, good too; sure seemed he was the bad-guy thrasher, no stand-in as far as I saw). I gave it five stars, wishing more stars were allowed. I've seen it three times; (I'm retired from media; study production values. TC's JR film is fine the first time, even better in multiple viewings. See it, you'll see how well it's made...

Circuitous + inane = Boring, frustrating and irritating. Pretty pictures though.

2287273,3,B0009ESTDW,While Oblivion had some impressive graphics and filming the storyline was lacking. The movie was very slow and I was expecting a little more action for the way the movie was advertised. Morgan Freeman was pretty much non-existing in the whole movie except for about 2 minutes. It would have been nice to added some more background material about the surviors and the past leading up to the present time of the story. Wasn't much character development at all for any of the major players in the movie. This movie was much hyped and I honestly was let down by the slow pace. Okay movie but I probably would have been better off renting it rather than owning it.,1377993600,,659,4.546218487394958

2287277,3,B0009ESTDW,"I watched this movie twice because I thought maybe I had slept through a crucial plot point. The movie moves at a confused pace. We take time to digest the broad devastation of our fair planet then we do a quick montage of the ""droids"" flying at impossible speeds and then slow down again to view the strained relationship of our tech worker and mate. Water is being sucked from the planet at an incredible rate yet there is plenty to create a floating pool for our hero. Said hero states to his ""other half"" that he thinks the ""scavs"" want to catch him and then they do. Lo and behold the ""scavs"" are human. All of a sudden these folk tell our hero they need his help to destroy everything our hero has been protecting and he seems OK with that.
I love Sci-fi, but this one is a head scratcher. There is not enough back story and too much emphases on CGI. The ride of Mr. Cruise on a motorcycle seemed only inserted so we could watch Tom Cruise on a motorcycle. Is it just me or did it seem like an ""I feel the need for speed"" moment when we saw the sunglasses on the shelf?

At least Tom Cruise is finally figuring it out without a good M83 sound track to go with the movie, I would of it given it a 2 rating. Russell Crowe movies whether a 1 or 5 rating realizes, a movie is only as good as the sound track to go with it.

Once the rental expires, even if you are halfway through it, the video shuts off. They need to explain that more clearly in their policies. I missed the last 5 minutes of the movie which was pretty sucky (maybe the last 5 minutes were excellent and made up for the previous 120)",1377907200,,472,4.436781609195402

It was done well, that's what counts! The movie was beautiful to watch, the plot was intriguing, the music was awesome. (Especially if you have surround sound!)

CONS:  The plot is convoluted and the basic concept is unrealistic and not particularly well conceived - even for science fiction.

2287318,1,B0009ESTDW,"I wanted to be open minded despite the fact that it stars Tom Cruise. I rather enjoyed _Minority Report_. It's what you should expect from having seen many other sci-fi films staring a ""teetering on the edge"" leading man. Only the acting was a bit worse than most. Channeling what I can only assume is an outdated boyishly cute quality didn't help Cruise in the first part of the film. The trait neither fit the plot nor his age.

As for the plot, you can figure it out pretty quickly based on familiar idea that the main character's inner self is smarter, deeper and more selflessly heroic than the establishment. I can't help but think it's the same storyline as _The Last Samurai_. Though I could be mistaken; I've all but blocked that one from my memory. Only Tom Cruise has the skill and knowledge to save us in a world where Tom Cruise cannot and will not die. As usual, the film is unwillingly dominated by his presence, so it's difficult to say if any other cast members were good.",1377820800,3,989,4.464088397790055

I hesitated to watch this now that we know how crazy Tom Cruise is, but he's still a good fit for a role like this.  (I would like to think this film might become an allegory for his personal disillusionment regarding the church of Scientology, his struggle against himself, and ultimate renouncement of the crazy).  A lot of the fun of sci-fi is in the gadgets, and here they do not disappoint.  Those drones are actually scary, and their domicile is like a preview of the iHouse (they live in an iPad, haha).

I would have liked to see more exploration of the human element, but there wouldn't have been a lot of room for that in what's basically a ""what-if-our-stuff-was-stolen"" on a grand scale tale.  Bottom line, it's fun, and I would watch it again.",1377734400,,918,4.527272727272727

2287352,2,B0009ESTDW,"I think the script tried to hard to be sophisticated but only succeeded in out convoluting itself to the point of confusion. Tom played Tom as usual and Morgan Freeman was reduced to a cameo, but Morgan is great at whatever he does.",1377734400,,232,4.4186046511627906

2287360,3,B0009ESTDW,"The concept of this movie was interesting. I can't say it was my favorite, but it's worth watching a couple of times. There's a bit of action and of course, there's that bit of romance and mystery mixed in. There were twists to the plot that I was really thrown for a loop, but I followed fairly well. (And if anyone knew me, they'd know I don't catch onto things very quickly sometimes!) I don't really understand the reason for sex in movies, or even nudity considering that the best stories are portrayed without that crap..however, putting that aside, I liked the movie alright. It's a little slow, but interesting.",1377734400,,619,4.636363636363637

2287364,5,B0009ESTDW,"I was expecting a typical brainless sci-fi action schlock film, and that's not what this is. Yes, there is some action, but it is very well thought out and shot. The vehicle design is what really impressed me in this movie. The ship that Tom Cruise flies around in is very practical and is actually something you could see being used in real life. The story is great and I found myself really caring about the characters and what was going to happen. There are enough twists to keep you interested and guessing, and the payoff is great.

The visuals are absolutely stunning. This is one of those rare films where you don't think ""that looks fake"". Everything looks real, and the locations..my god the locations...A lot of work went into finding the perfect locations for this film. They do such a good job of merging locations with built sets that you forget you are watching fiction. I can't say enough good things about this movie.",1377734400,,933,4.620481927710843

2287369,5,B0009ESTDW,"This story really surprised me! It looked good and was one that I wanted to see, but I had my concerns that it wasn't going to be anything special. After watching it I can confidently say that it exceeded my expectations. The story was unique and had a twist that I didn't see coming until late in the story. It was a great action/mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed.",1377734400,,365,4.382352941176471
2287370,4,B0009ESTDW,"I watched this movie expecting an explosion filled slightly confusing sci-fi flick, which would have honestly been just fine because I like explosions and science fiction. However; this movie went much deeper than anticipated, the story line is exceptionally well laid out and it went further and deeper than most sci-fi films of today. I found myself placed in the story as if I were a character in the plot, the movie brings up questions of purpose, the classic ""Why are we here?"" kind of stuff, and it does it in such a subtle way that I felt like a friggin philosopher during some post movie discussion.
Bottom line: I'll be getting this one on DVD soon.",1377734400,,658,4.632478632478633

2287377,4,B0009ESTDW,"Very good movie even though I'm not a big sci-fi fan.  I particularly enjoyed the love story, the surprise twists and turns, and the ending left me wanting more.  Glad I added it to my collection and I will definitely be watching it over again.",1377648000,,244,4.4
2287378,5,B0009ESTDW,"I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, and wasn't really in the mood to see it, but was instantly drawn in by the spectacular visuals/cinematography and ethereal soundtrack. A perfect match, and I practically forgot I was watching Tom cruise. Subtle acting, no unnecessary over-explaining dialogue, and no distracting product placement. I was a bit baffled by negative reviews on rotten tomatoes. I've watched this film twice now and liked it just as much the second time.",1377648000,,459,5.052631578947368
2287379,4,B0009ESTDW,I wasn't expecting much as this movie got panned but it exceeded my low expectations. Wasn't that bad. I like sci-fi and special effects if they are done well and I enjoyed this movie. Wasn't great but wasn't bad.,1377648000,,213,4.487179487179487
2287380,5,B0009ESTDW,It was overall a very good movie. I had to watch it in bits and pieces but the twists and turns were good and kept you interested.,1377648000,,130,3.8518518518518516
2287381,3,B0009ESTDW,This film was interesting because Tom Cruise was the actor. But take away that and the story is old and not freshly told.,1377648000,,121,4.304347826086956
2287382,4,B0009ESTDW,Good Tom Cruise movie.  Nice plot twist at the end.  I stayed with it all the way through.  Worth watching twice.,1377648000,,113,4.285714285714286
2287383,5,B0009ESTDW,"First saw this in the theatre and was expecting a decent sic-fi movie, but instead much better than I thought. This move was great, really enjoyed it and had to own it. Plus the soundtrack by M83 is absolutely stunning!!!",1377648000,,221,4.55
2287384,4,B0009ESTDW,"Surprisingly better than I thought it would be.  Oblivion is well crafted and gives us an interesting look into a not so perfect world.  Unlike many of the films in this category Oblivion held my interest throughout.  Well not a major Cruise follower I thought he did well in playing an all too familiar roll in science fiction films.  I liked the storyline and the relationships both within his 'home' base and the outside world where is works.  The special effects were really well done and the environments where we discovered each step along the main characters journey with him were wonderful and kept my interest.
Morgan Freeman is of course Morgan which is fine but his character's story was short and too predictable for me.  There were a few unforeseen left turns in the story which worked but the ending was pretty much a Hollywood ending.  I liked it and recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction whether your a Tom Cruise fan or not.",1377648000,3,952,4.664670658682635

2287386,4,B0009ESTDW,"I was surprised this movie did not do better at the Box Office. Honestly I watched this movie only out of lack of anything else to do. Boy was that wrong. I found it kept me wondering what was going to happen next with a lot of ""I didn't see that coming"" Movie of the year it is not, but definitely a movie worth seeing and I am glad I added it to my Sci-Fi Collection",1377648000,,368,3.8552631578947367
2287387,5,B0009ESTDW,"When I can I plan on buying this movie. Unlike the reviews, I actually loved this movie.

Without giving anything away, I love the fact that it had twists and surprises. It was definitely exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat, I almost have no fingernails left.

If you want a surprising movie, that is fun and wonderful, this is DEFINITELY a movie to watch!!!",1377648000,,366,4.367647058823529
2287388,5,B0009ESTDW,"I decided to rent this simply because I love Morgan Freeman, and think Tom Cruise, despite...well, I don't have that much space...is a fantastic actor.  I didn't really remember much from the television promo's so I viewed the trailer.  It still did not look familiar (trying to remember if I had seen it before) so I rented it.  That was the best $4.99 I have ever spent on a movie rental I do believe.  It's hard to refrain from recapitulating the fine points made in most of the preceding reviews for they all share my amazement of this film.  It is almost completely original; yes we've seen the post-apocalyptic rebirth of earth and its meek survivors before, but this differs from those, I believe, because that is not the story-line.  It acts as supporting role to the main plot/theme - that being the power of human spirit, sacrifice, strategic defiance, and determination.  The action was fantastic.  When the drones go flying through the underground headquarters spinning, flying, and firing in all directions at high speeds, well, I have to admit I was on the edge of my seat brimmed with fervent anticipation, wonder, and bedazzlement!
I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a pulse; or rather, NOT to those with weak pulses!  Spectacularly visionaired (apologies for the flagrant use of poetic-license)with vibrant setting, a staccatic yet perfectly blended score, and an apparent limitless budget...in the words of John Hammond, they ""spared no expense.""  I rarely purchase movies as I normally don't watch them over and over again.  In order for me to do so, its got to be somewhat of a classic like, ironically, Shawshank Redemption (the irony being that Morgan Freeman obviously is in both...hmmm, can irony be obvious? Squirrel! Sorry for the Attention Deficit Disorder!), the GREAT Resident Evil, Back To the Future, or the before-allusioned-to Jurassic Park series, etc.  But I can promise you I will be purchasing a Blu-Ray copy of this one.
In summary:  GET IT!",1377648000,,1995,4.954954954954955

2287394,4,B0009ESTDW,"I felt like it was a mesh of Alien, Reign of Fire, Star Wars, Star Trek: First Contact (the one with the Borg).  I thought it was a great sci-fi movie.  Check it out.  I think you'll enjoy it.",1377561600,,192,3.871794871794872

2287401,3,B0009ESTDW,Temporal dislocations and historical misrepresentations combine with overly subtle cloning themes to make a simple tale barely discernible within the awkwardly assembled footage. Good effects. Nice locations.,1377561600,,208,6.7407407407407405

2287403,5,B0009ESTDW,"This was and is my favorite SciFi movie so far for 2013. I of course enjoyed Man of Steel, Star Trek, Iron Man 3, World War Z ,etc. But this one was a bit different and I thought it was well done and visually stunning. Wish I could see it on the big screen again. Oh and it has a killer score and interesting enough, the Blu Ray has an option to watch the movie with no dialogue and only the score playing. Pretty cool if you are a movie score lover. The other Blu Ray to have this was also a Tom Cruise move - Jack Reacher.",1377561600,,524,3.861111111111111
2287404,4,B0009ESTDW,Another really great movie by Cruise.  Premise and screenplay were outstanding and should be noted by Oscar nomination.  Cruise seems to have the ability to pick out great story lines and then make them believable.  His personal life effect how he perceived in the movies but he seems to make us forget that part of his life as you a drawn into the story lines of whatever he is doing,1377561600,,384,4.457142857142857
2287405,4,B0009ESTDW,"I personally don't care for Tom Cruise, but you have to hand it to him, most of his movies deliver the action in a big way and Oblivion follows suit.  I found Oblivion highly entertaining, and unlike a lot of current sci-fi flicks today, is not as predictable as I expected.  While character development is on the thin side, the action and suspense will help you overlook it - and just when you think you know how it's going to end - Bam! - it throws you for a loop.  I appreciate that in a film.  Morgan Freeman delivers his end of the bargain and is a good addition to Cruise as far as star power goes.  I watched this film on a 2 hour flight and didn't once look at my watch. Accordingly, I give it 4 stars as it delivered exactly what I wanted - action, suspense, and great special effects.  If you are looking for something more, you'll probably be disappointed.",1377561600,,867,4.2560975609756095

The visuals are stunning but haven't we become blase about this sort of thing in this day and age? I know I have. I still want a story that I can follow and one that will hold my interest. This movie is L-O-N-G, so long and so dull that I had to watch it over two days because it was putting me to sleep. Morgan Freeman gives us another elder-statesman type part. Didn't I just see him in Olympus has fallen playing the same character? Well, I guess at his age, he needs the money. Tom Cruise is getting OLD! They try unsuccessfully to squeeze tears out of you by using such touches as Procul Harem's ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" and several shots of Andrew Wyeth's CHRISTINA'S WORLD.

2287435,3,B0009ESTDW,"The movie had entertaining parts, but was so sloppy that it just didn't deliver.  I'd have to watch it again, which I won't, to mention all the parts that either didn't make sense or were unnecessary, impossible, or unbelievable - yes I realize this is sci-fi, but you can still make the story believable by doing some homework.

I will mention three things that bugged me without any real spoilers.
1 - Why in the world would Jack (Tom Cruise) ever need a motorcycle in this environment when his bubble ship could go anywhere the motorcycle could?  The only reason is so that TC could see himself on a motorcycle on the big screen yet again (Top Gun, MI-2, et al).  Unnecessary and stupid.
2 - The protection inside the transparent pod on his bubble ship didn't really provide much protection other than the seat-belt harness.  There were several scenes where the one or two people inside would have never survived the shock/forces on them.  Poor physics.  (Yes, there were plenty of other physics issues with the movie, but this was my biggest beef.)
3 - The ending was the main sloppy part.  Too many unanswered questions.  They really could have made a nice story out of this, but it was a little more than half a story.  It should have been an hour longer with more development and more loose ends tied up.  What a waste!",1377475200,3,1326,4.552742616033755
2287436,4,B0009ESTDW,A bit predictable and not a fast paced blow-em-up but it was a good story and done well.  I really enjoyed watching it and I think Tom Cruise was perfect for his part. As for Morgan Freeman: he is a good actor but I am tired of him playing the same type character in so many movies and having him in any movie actually detracts from it for me now.,1377475200,,347,3.9571428571428573

The story is so complex one has to listen to the features commentary to ""get it""- what w 2 jacks, etc.- but the movie holds yr attention and is intriguing in its difficultness.
In the commentary one gets too many self congratulatory remarks abt how great the movie is, how great we are, how great Morgan Freeman is- awesome, unbelievable- does this generation have any modesty?
But over all- they did a good job.",1377475200,,657,4.349593495934959
2287440,5,B0009ESTDW,After looking at some of the reviews I never gave this movie a chance. Happened to be at a friends house and we watched this and we were both pleased beyond imagination. Tom Cruise is just rock solid. Simple little part I know but if you get this pay attention to the part where he is trapped in the hole trying to fix the drone and watch how he handles the scene with the assault rifle he uses. Guy prepares for these movies like few do. Morgan Freeman as always top notch. Loved the story and was a little shocked at how some reviews just didn't get it. The movie is actually really easy to follow and will bring you through the complete emotional cycle and do it well which I really enjoy in any movie. The living pads in the sky were a nice touch and the harrier like jet was pretty damn cool. Should have figured out some things much sooner than I did but I loved it well done.,1377475200,,882,4.133720930232558
2287441,5,B0009ESTDW,"Good story line, good acting, imaginative.  Most of todays Sci Fi is all about CGI and very short on story.  This is a very good balance between the two.

2287443,1,B0009ESTDW,"I thought this was going to be a fast paced science fiction movie.  Instead, it felt more like a silent documentary.

2287444,3,B0009ESTDW,"Whenever Cruise's name is attached to anything like this, I automatically assume that it's crap, but this one turns out to be worth a look.  No doubt that whatever quality exists in Oblivion is due to the fact that director Joseph Kosinski was permitted to direct his own graphic-novel source material, and thus stay true to the sci-fi heart of the story.  I feel that discussing much of the plot very quickly gets into spoiler territory.  The set-up: Earth has been attacked by aliens, but humans have won the battle--at the cost of the Earth's habitability.  Remaining humans are being offloaded from the planet to a giant space station, while a few ""techs"" (Cruise) hunt down the last aliens (savages or ""Savs"").

Special effects are more than acceptable for a current product.  The casting is successful:  Cruise doesn't repel;  Morgan Freeman is onscreen much, much less than his costar billing would tend to indicate.  Andrea Riseborough is notable as Cruise's ""tech"" assistant-lover.  And Olga Kurylenko has navigated the path from teenage model to talented movie actress suprisingly well; she's improved, bit-by-bit, in each movie she's appeared in recently.",1377475200,3,1166,5.154255319148936

2287449,5,B0009ESTDW,"Planet Earth has supposedly been devastated by a war with 'aliens', and most of humanity is living off world on Saturn's Moon 'Titan'.  A few stay back to watch over and protect the 'power generators' sending the power back to the Titan Station.  You see transmissions between the maintenance crew and Titan, protecting and maintaining these power generators, and then these few are looking forward to joining 'Titan Earth' people.

This movie has many refreshing twists.  I won't give them away.  Morgan Freeman pops up a little later... :)

Overall, this is a wonderful remembering of what humanity is, was and how much we (I) appreciate the beauty of the Earth as it is.  Another aspect of this movie is that our memories and who we are, are much more than a mechanical, chemical, or robotic program.  Our being or spirit is instead a 'wholographic' and spiritual being, of memory... sorry, better not say more :)

There are fun twists later in the movie... This is a movie to me that says ""yes"" to our humanity, care, empathy, and appreciation to the beauty of earth,... no to transhumanism and post humanism.  (Look it up)

Beyond that, if you don't want to think about 'meanings' or 'morals of the story', it is a great movie of 'empowerment' facing massive odds.

2287494,4,B0009ESTDW,"Let me first say that I thought director&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joseph-Kosinski-s/dp/B004R63MWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joseph Kosinski's</a>&nbsp;Tron: Legacy was abysmal. And apparently, a sizable portion of critics and audiences shared my opinion. But there were moments watching that I could not help but be impressed. Kosinski has a great visual eye, and shows mastery of lighting and framing. There are scenes in the film of startling beauty, like, ""Wow. This movie is actually not ALL bad."" Colour me intrigued. What else could this guy do?

When he was coupled with arguably Hollywood's biggest movie star -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Cruise/dp/B00A2FSXHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Cruise</a>, a great supporting cast - including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Morgan-Freeman/dp/B00464AVXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Morgan Freeman</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Olga-Kurylenko/dp/B004NEY9EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Olga Kurylenko</a>, a bigger budget, and a promising script based on a six-page graphic novel treatment he penned, I was ready to give Joseph Kosinski a second chance.

I saw Oblivion. Let's see what I thought below.

Movies live or die on their casting so let's talk about that first. I understand the doubts about Tom Cruise, but really, there's no need for that. Put aside your thoughts about his personal life; the couch jumping, Katie Holmes, and all that. The role of futuristic drone repairman Jack Harper is quite possibly among his finest. Cruise shows he has a real screen presence, which, when combined with his roguish charm and charisma, results in a surprisingly sympathetic and impressive performance.

Cruise's character is onscreen 90% of the time, so his performance is a big factor in the film's power. I can safely say that Jack Harper managed to be interesting, cool, and emotional without being over-the-top or sappy. Kudos to you, Tom. You might not be the finest of actors, but you're always fun to watch.

Olga Kurylenko and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andrea-Riseborough/dp/B00CIXK8KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andrea Riseborough</a>&nbsp;both give excellent performances as the films two female leads: respectively, the mysterious crash-landed astronaut Julia, and Jack's conflicted co-member Victoria. While Kurylenko's character brings the love interest and the mysterious flashbacks, Riseborough's Victoria is much more interesting and strong, plotwise. in the supporting cast we find Morgan Freeman, who is his usual awesome self as Malcolm Beech, one of the few remaining humans on earth; and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikolai-Coster-Waldau/dp/B007HJ84ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikolai Coster-Waldau</a>, who brings the muscle and the beard factor to the game. Fine roles, all round!

And here's another reason to watch Oblivion. Oblivion has the finest cinematography I have seen in a film this year. Echoing Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey, the stunning landscape of Iceland comes to vivid, awe-inspiring life with a minimum of CGI and a maximum of practical effects, camera tricks, and good ol'fashioned location shooting. Crumbling volcanos, vast mesas, winding canyons, valleys, endless plains, shifting deserts, dizzying peaks, and open sky are all beautifully shot, and, with a bit of CGI touch-up, become the alien-ravaged world of 2077. Seriously, see this in IMAX and you will not be disappointed. Oblivion is a veritable FEAST for the eyes.

The costumes and tech and equipment are amazing as well. Kosinski chose to go for a more practical route here, and the extra work pays off. The world of Oblivion reminds one of an Apple Computer or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-2009/dp/B002PMPTIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (2009)</a>, but there are telltale signs that this is a lived-in, breathed-in, realistic world. Jack Harper's white costumes bears stains and grit; his chrome gun is scratched a little bit; his baseball cap is faded. Malcolm Beech's leathers are functional and weathered, while the garb of astronaut Julia is pristine grey and follows the clean lines of NASA. Form follows function, as Oblivion designer David Simon says, and so Oblivion's equipment - the drones, the planes, the guns, the motorcycles, the clothes, the beds, the electronics, even the sound of the tech, is all designed for maximum realism. But that's not to say it doesn't look cool. It does.

I applaud Joseph Kosinski for his restraint when it came to CGI, and his use of practical sets and props. Here's to more in the future.

Now, shall we talk cons? Oblivion borrows from too many movies to list. I see a bit of Moon here, Logan's Run there, a little of Star Wars there, is that a Solaris reference I spy? As original as Oblivion may seem, it may all be superficial - just on the surface. The story has been done plenty of times before, just not with this incredible cinematography and eye for detail. The climax was slightly ""out there"", and didn't reeeally fit the rest of the film tonally, but Tom Cruise's memorable one-liner is enough to make it worth it all.

In conclusion, Oblivion is one of the best science fiction films to come out this year. But it's a good thing not many sci-fi films DID come out in 2013, because Oblivion is not as epic or original as it might want to be. That's not to stop the great acting, explosive action, great sets, costumes, and cool tech, and cool M83 score from letting you have a great time at the movies. My rating? Four and a half drones out of five. But why don't you watch it and see for yourself?

2287496,4,B0009ESTDW,"Like all good sci fi, it was a bit slow at the start, unfortunately packing all the exposition that would normally be chapter after chapter into the hour means that some of the finesse of the story telling was lost.

Overall an Excellent Movie. The second half made up for the first half, although it true sci fi fashion it would have benefitted from either being a series or an extended version like the multi dvd Dune.

Tom Cruise played it straight, a few more quirks and human foibles in the first half would have aided his rise from run of the mill citizen to warrior and hero better. I'm sure there could have been more useful stuff written for both Morgan and Olga. Morgan was mainly for exposition and he does a fine job, Olga transitioned from her recovery a little strange with little room in the story. Lets face it 2 hours is not a long time. The Mission Control was sufficiently annoying with the ""are you an effective team"" you just hope someone shuts her up by the end of the movie...

A good measure of Sci Fi is whether it leaves you asking more questions at the end. They are a modern version of parables, giving good food for thought. It left me with a number of questions, none of which I will share as they would obviously spoil the movie for others.",1377302400,2,1271,4.3544303797468356

2287498,3,B0009ESTDW,"Overall, the story let's down this movie. Have we not had enough of aliens stealing Earth's water? There was no excitement, no special moments and nothing memorable.

The characters are not particularly interesting.

If you are putting actors like Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, I think you should be something better with them, then what they did. Although I think, the best performance was by Andrea Riseborough possibly as she had the most interesting character.

The acting is good, and the filming was good. The special effects were above average.

Would I see it again? No as I know the ending.

Would I recommend it? The problem here is that to appreciate it. You need the big screen, but I do not think its worth the price for a ticket to see it.",1377302400,,754,4.639097744360902

2287519,1,B0009ESTDW,"I apologize but find it necessary to comment on a film which will probably gross 4 hundred million dollars or more in ""its "" lifetime. I promise not to give any plot give aways but just read some Bradbury or Ellison and you are almost There.
This film was more  than 120 minutes of computer generated  entertainment and I will.probably never think about it again as there are better films and tv shows with similar concepts.
 The locations were wisely chosen but with many graphics added to show the decay of war.
Many film lovers like to go back and THINK about the film from time to time . Not all great films need that all important message but please let our minds run a little wild with imagination from time to time after viewing a block buster with a fine cast and new visions of the future.
Think about a film such as SILENT RUNNING. You saw the near future with a cast of three humans  and two robots. We were given an actual view of the importance of inter species relationships. Humankind to nature. We saw and hopefully still think how reckless we have been  with land development and its long term impact on OUR planet.
A film may leave us with hope and compassion such as ET. Its a classic .Much simpler sets .Its greatness is in the fantasy left for the audience to dream and wonder.
 In Oblivian its not there. This film is just another clone of somone elses images of a possible future. Oblivion does not churn any new thoughts for me which has not been shown before in other forms. As I stated earlier its just 2 hours of entertainment and its gone. Please do not misuderstand me . Some films are just that ,pure entertainment. When it comes to the sci fi genre Im hoping for more. Lets rattle the cages ,stir up strong feeling we have for a brighter future or how to prevent global catastrophe. I did not get a whisper from this film . I watched this film three times wondering when am I going to get it (didnt finish round three and just gave up.
No loss to the producers though . Much money and time spent with possibly a great $ return. Why not it is Mr. excitement himself. He just missed this time . Please show me what I have missed. Is this a film from a graphic novel that was  just too subtle for me to get all the physical metaphors ?
Truly, I know many films are a disappointment when you expect more of whatever. Grossing the national debt on a film that did not provide much in.entertainment or lacked  a thought provoking idea in anyway is sad. Especially when there is much to that we can think about if presented differently.
Stop here the rest is a spoiler
IF YOU LIKE THE PLOT (FROM READING THE OTHER REVIEWS) THEN I SUGGEST THE FILM ""MOON"" . IT ALSO DEALS WITH THE VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF CLONING . Is memory also retained in the genetic composition of the newly cloned cell? If it is then an individual never really dies. All that he/she was is still there and will be there in all future generations of that genome. Its a type of rebirth or reincarnation of the human essence.
Moon is a more personal film. Oblivion is an actioner that depends so heavily on graphics to create the atmosphere . In Moon the character(s) really pull you in to their dilemma.  The computer generated graphics are no where near that of Oblivion but relies more on character development to feel the pain or shock of human replication for economic advantages. The CONCEPT is so deep and thought provoking that simple sets work just as well. Its not about what you see on a screen but with what thoughts you leave the theater or your set at home. There is a concept here that certainly deserves some thought.",1377216000,3,3626,4.383928571428571

One thing that annoys me is that every commercial and/or trailer for this movie shows Morgan Freeman along with Tom Cruise as the main characters. BUT don't be fooled: Mrs Freeman's name (whom I adore) is there only to attract more viewer, I guess.

This is a movie more for adults than tiny kids.  This movie does not spoon feed the audience every detail, the movie drops you into a situation and tells a story.

On the actors... great job!  Some of the actors just weirded me out and I never quite knew what they were going to do.  Others were just solid performances.
On the effects... I loved the drones.  The way the movie portrayed them, I felt nervous when they were in a scene.

No, it wasn't a action movie and I loved the fact it wasn't. In Fact it was a very intelligent complex well written story. I thought Tom Cruise's perfomance was one of the best he's had in along time. He actually had emotion and did seem vunerable and unsure of himself. I think any person that is intelligent and like challenging stories should see this. What it basically comes down too everything he knows is wrong. And why is everything in the state that it is in today is one big question. But as the movie progresses it give us all the answers we are looking for. The film isn't set up in a heroic type nature or action adventure type. Its about a man that is a technician and honestly just has bad days at work. And his quest to find the truth and to deal with the situations as they come up. Which is a rare style in this day in age for cinema. M83 did a great job with the music score it brought the film out. Instead of just playing as background music like most films. The score made the scenes more emotional and important. The visuals were astonishing and very uniquie like a tron or ridley scott affair. Joseph has his own style like Ridley Scott which is rare in the industy of todays american cinema. I really can't wait to see what he comes up with in the future as well as the next Tron adventure.

2287546,5,B0009ESTDW,"OBLIVION, with Tom Cruise. It's very much about working for The Machine. I won't elaborate the story further, other than to say that the RottenTomato rating is seriously off on this one, giving it only a middling score. Beautifully filmed, well paced, solid performances. I can see why Cruise bought the graphic novel from whence the story originates (considering his denominational worldview) - but then, I could care less about his ""theology"".

Considering the NSA revelations about our own gov't spying on us, repeatedly lying to FISA Court, hounding journalists (""Journalism is not terrorism!""), keeping secrets under penalty of death - while citizens are denied the liberty of unbreakable encryption to secure our own private space, this really surpasses The Matrix, and I Robot, in many respects. Stimulating storytelling.

Wake up America. Read WHY AMERICA FAILED, (by Morris Berman) if you're up for an honest challenge. Much in both products to ponder!",1377216000,2,961,5.315789473684211

2287550,3,B0009ESTDW,Thought the movie was okay. Tom Curise has always done good in action movies. This isn't a Mission Impossible but does have a good bit of action. Would have liked to have seen a lot more of Morgan Freeman here.,1377216000,,210,4.275

2287557,5,B0009ESTDW,"If you are a Sci-Fi lover then you will enjoy this movie. I thought the acting was very good, the visuals and sound were excellent, and the story was good. My biggest complaint would be that I thought the story could have been expanded on and had more depth to it where we saw more of who the aliens were, more of where they came from, and more of what they were like. You really never get a sense of this and it is a little disappointing. Overall though a very good movie.",1377129600,,473,4.096774193548387

Once again I got fooled into renting another Tom Cruise Action movie from a great trailer and being left disappointed.  I went with three stars however because some of the special effects are great and I love the actual plot (which I won't share since it is a big spoiler).  Better actor and smoother story and this easily could have been 4 out of 5 stars.",1377129600,,502,4.208333333333333
2287563,4,B0009ESTDW,"Sadly my wife could not understand it.  One particular problem is with the female roles.  None of the them speak clearly and project their voices such that the audience can understand their words.  The problem may be with the producers not understanding speech quality and thus producing poor quality sound (voices) and sometimes coupled with loud background music.  This problem seems to be typical in many movies today but certainly not all of them.  This one has a lot of big noise scenes but the voice only ones stink.  Overall, if one understands the intent the viewer can watch and be entertained but many people will be lost.",1377129600,,632,4.805555555555555

Without giving away anything, the enjoyable part is that there are a few twists to the plot make it just a bit suspenseful but also answers questions you have.

Pros
1. the special effects were awesome, but with technology increasing it hardly looked like it was in the future.
2. morgan freeman was great in this movie, but tom cruze was his same old self, he just seemed like some lunatic, that liked to move stuff in a jerky type of manor and call it acting.

Cons
1. the plot was just silly, multiple jacks and his assistant repairing drones really???
2. all of that lead up about aliens, and guess what there were no aliens, just a huge pyramid space station that is all empty except more drones and clones of jack and his assistant. the only thing that ran it was .... Wait for it.... a smaller AI pyramid with a red eye..... seriously, is holy wood that lacking for ideas?
3. with the exception of the flying drones there was nothing that said future tech OMG there in the future.
4. ANOTHER MOVIE about them draining earth of its water for fuel, seriously??? water is the most abundant resource in the universe, yet aliens travel light years to destroy a civilization for water, they stole this idea from battle field earth.
5. NO ALIENS, they tried that in contact and the movie tanked.

From the very beginning of the piracy warnings before the movie even started, the poor quality of the stream rendered the viewing experience impossible. I tried resetting my connection and rebooting my computer to no avail. The video was extremely low-quality even when I wasn't viewing on fullscreen, not that it should matter.

Morgan Freeman gives his usual role as the ""father"" of events to come, which I(don't know about you) never, ever get tired of. Tom Cruise doesn't let down, as he pushes for answers as his current reality and questions come to pass. As the story continues to march forward, you find yourself linking events slowly together, even as a major plot is revealed rather early in the movie. That is something that most movies fail to accomplish. All the way to the very last scene, I was satisfied. Watch this if you haven't.",1377043200,,730,4.848

2287623,5,B0009ESTDW,"I gave the movie 5 stars because the U.S. of A is severely lacking when it comes to science fiction movies and I liked this movie.

As a teenager in the 80s, I never understood the Tom Cruise (and Brad Pitt) phenomenon. I think that Tom Cruise had gotten a lot better as he's gotten older. And for me that says a lot; I wish I could say the same for Brad Pitt (Note: I hated Brad Pitts version of World War Z, I mean whats the point? If you're not going to stay true to the book, why not just hire a bunch of screenwriters to write a zombie movie and slap a title on it?.....) Sorry....

I enjoyed the storyline, and unlike other boys and girls out there, no, I did not wonder why Morgan Freeman wore shades throughout the entire movie. I am perturbed that people have many questions they feel were unanswered, so I'm going to answer some of those questions:

if the aliens have the technology to build enormous universe-traversing spaceships, build and deploy hundreds of enormous factories from that ship that are capable of draining energy from out oceans over the course of decades, and deploy hundreds of nigh-bulletproof drones armed with laser cannons to protect them, why in the hell did they need an army of Tom Cruises (TC) and Emily Riseboroughs (ER)?

Well, boys and girls, in this instance it was one super-brain narcissitic alien running the show with a lot of drones. Do you really think a narcissitic alien would allow its own kind to live and rule along side it? No. ""Sally"", was the only alien. It deployed numerous clones of Tom and Emily because it couldn't leave it's triangular vehicle without putting itself in danger, and enter earth's atmosphere to fight, it's too large and it would be vulnerable.  It required an army of humans to defeat humans. Just like we have antibiotics....(what is happening in our education system that this question was even posed?)

what happened to the other at-least-50 Tom Cruises and at-least-51 Emily Rossboroughs?
The ones in the ship? they died along with ""Sally""
The ones on earth? Well, who knows?  But it must've been hell waking up that morning.

* Why Does ""Tech 49"" Have Jack Harper's Memories if He's a Clone?
That is a good question and I'm glad it was asked because that means a majority of the population see clones as individualistic, having their own personalities and souls. My only answer is because it's fiction.

I would recommend Oblivion, I found it entertaining and afterwards, like many, asked many questions that had nothing to do with the movie. Let's remember that this is fiction, and most screen writers do not have a technical degree, that's why it's fiction.",1376956800,,2645,4.6587982832618025

I would recommend the movie, and viewing in high definition on the Kindle or even better my computer monitor system which is HD display compatible. Unfortunately previous offerings I have purchased and unsuccessfully attempted to view on my computer were not a good experience. So I will say that I will probably purchase a movie for viewing on my Kindle fire with high confidence my viewing experience will be reliably pleasant.

For me, that meant that the editing was all about getting Tom Cruise scenes in, but not letting us know the whys and what fores! It was typical Tom Cruise moves with him out performing his stunt man on fight scenes and motorcycle moves. Once again, his female co-star was too young!! (It's one of my gripes seeing the male lead have a too-young female lead, like there weren't any females his own age who could play the part!)

2287674,4,B0009ESTDW,"I have mixed emotions about this movie.  I was a little disappointed with it the first time I saw it, but watched it again several hours later and found that I appreciated it more and was able to ignore some of the holes in the plot (and it would be hard to describe them without giving away too much).  The main things are these:  It's handsomely, even spectacularly, made with an interesting premise, a lot of fascinating action between the characters, and a thoroughly satisfying resolution.  And I feel that those who rip this movie apart do so because it wasn't what they expected.  I hate to label it a thinking person's film, but to some degree it is, which is surprising, since it is based on a graphic novel and some of the action scenes seem straight out of a high tech video game.  But that's just a small part of it and most of the film revolves around intriguing characters. The director has created an amazing world here, with very good acting and some spectacular effects.  I went back and watched it a third time and liked it even more and intend to add the Blu-ray to my collection.  This is an excellent movie, and I just don't understand some of the hostility that has been directed towards it.  I think that it's a triumph for director Kosinsky and his wonderful crew.

Follow-up: I did indeed buy it here on Blu-ray, and think of it as just short of 5 stars -- and I swear that my eyes fill with tears during the final moments every single time I've watched it!

I was raised in the heady days of Apollo and my literary tastes eventually included the entire pantheon of speculative fiction from Asimov to Zelazny.  I saw Star Wars 16 times in the theater after I got out of boot camp.  I was never a Trekker, but I watched the first series and Next Generation.  I even liked Wall-E.  The first time, that is, not this version.  This is a pastiche of plots from a wide swath of SciFi, and not a tasty one.  Cruise is and will always be a bad actor.  Good directors shoot his emotional scenes using shots of his back because his face never matches his vocal delivery or body language.  He may have embraced his faith as a way of explaining the weird somatic separation in his acting.  In this dog he is on-screen nearly the entire time, trying to be dramatic and achieving elevated levels of boredom.

2287715,4,B0009ESTDW,"Best sci-fi movie I've seen in a long while. (Of course, that's damning with faint praise considering the lowly state of most sci-fi these days.) Despite a few shortcomings, most aspects of Oblivion are a cut above the standard. First, the storyline is genuinely intriguing, even if it ultimately fails to generate that ineffable sense of wonder that the best sci-fi is capable of. (I give it points for an earnest attempt, though.) Second, the movie is visually stunning, especially during the first half. Sunsets bathe the characters in a moody radiance; the vistas of a ravaged Earth are close to breathtaking; camera angles immerse the viewer in the action in inventive ways; and the tech is both totally believable and pretty darn cool. Third, the film displays an intelligence that is increasingly rare in Hollywood and therefore most welcome. The only real downside is the reliance (as is so common these days) on a multitude of action set-pieces, one after the other. However, the pacing leaves sufficient room to breathe between each fight/chase sequence that the viewer doesn't feel overwhelmed. My biggest gripe about the movie (and it's an admittedly small one) is the payoff line Tom Cruise's character utters at the climax. He literally just finishes quoting Tacitus or some similar Roman poet-historian, only to follow that with the most cringe-inducing of vulgar epithets. If that's the filmmakers' idea of an inspirational sound bite, then they sorely miscalculated. Aside from that misstep, though, Oblivion gets most things right and proves to be a wholly enjoyable entertainment that respects the audience's intelligence.

I loved this movie; connects with action, mystery, and surprisingly an enduring love. Tom Cruse's character has an awesome job on earth, thrill seekers would be envious.

2287738,3,B0009ESTDW,"Bottom line:  This is your typical Hollywood attempt at a big budget science fiction flick.  It has good initial primary character development, good plot, then sort of fizzles out at the end.  If you've seen the indie sci-fi flick ""Moon,"" you'll likely end up underwhelmed.  Read on, ONLY if you're not afraid of SPOILERS.

Now to the nitty gritty- The movie gives you a place to start, a premise for the story, and throws in some  amazing special effects to wow audiences.  Tom Cruise's character is a ""yes"" man who spends the first hour of the movie discovering there's more than meets the eye  (Sort of like George Clooney's ""Solaris""- There are unanswered questions.  The second half of the movie is spent turning a good sci-fi theme into an action flick.  A woman from a dream, his wife, joins him on the roller coaster of a ride, again more showy special effects.  In the last twenty-five minutes, the movie seems to rush, running out of time to wrap everything up into a nice, neat package.  It doesn't quite do the plot justice.

The end of this movie is just too ""live happily ever after,"" without the emotional attachment- All the surviving, underdeveloped minor characters come together after the heroic salvation of the human race, and the movie ends.

In short, this movie is a story turned mediocre Hollywood.",1376784000,,1323,4.745614035087719

This was a great movie one of those that you will watch again afew weeks/months later and still enjoy and possibly see something next time you had missed first or second time around, definately a keeper.  Acting top-notch as expected with actors like TC and MF.  Wasn't sure of the ladies but they did a great job will look for more movies with them in later.  Scenery was earily and stark yet surreal and beautiful perfect background for this story.  Sure one could 'pick at' most movies and I wonder how Tech didn't seem to notice flight 52 coming from 49's pilot/repairman's home as the origin of the journey to space HQ? It was 49 who found the downed spacecraft with survivor, but as 52 he made the journey to Tech HQ.  Hmmm guess I will just have to watch again and check that out.

2287751,3,B0009ESTDW,"The first three-quarters of Oblivion wasn't so bad.  I found it intriguing enough to hold my attention and keep me interested.  By the end of my first viewing, however, I was completely stumped.  What was I not understanding?  So...I watched it again.  I even enjoyed it more the second time than the first but wham! Got to the end and was again completely baffled.  I guess I'll have to consult someone much smarter than I (not hard) to help me understand what in the world is going on because Oblivion isn't providing any obvious clues.  Why the unnecessary complications?  The rest of the movie was enjoyable to watch but was also fairly standard sci-fi stuff when it comes right down to it.  I doubt that I ever want to watch it again simply because of it's confusing nature.  I have to ask: Why mess with the audience that way?  Why not write a script that clearly explains what's going on?  Too much is simply left dangling which ultimately destroys the entire movie except for the fact that the graphics and other aspects of the movie are quite stunning and interesting.

I was somewhat loathe to give Oblivion 3 stars; it really deserves a weak 2.5 stars.  Oh yes, just as a side note, one other aspect of this movie that I just couldn't understand:  Victoria/Vika's eyes were so dilated throughout most of the movie that it was as if she was on LSD or something.  Actually, when she first appears, I thought she was meant to be some kind of android or something.  Her behavior was also very unhumanlike; more robotic than human.  And the very obvious fake eyelashes of hers in the year 2077?  I mean, here they can clone humans and develop all these high tech gadgets and weapons, but can't come up with a more realistic looking fake eyelash?  And again, what's with those eyes of hers?  In addition, anyone who's ever had their pupils dilated that much knows how sensitive to light your eyes become, often forcing the person to wear sunglasses.  Again, there is never any reason or explanation made apparent for this.

In the end, there are just way too many plot holes and logical inconsistencies to truly ""sell"" this movie to me.  I was on board for the better part of the movie until the end.  Sorry, the director, writers and producers failed to close the deal with me on this one and yet made a film with some saving graces as well.

2287753,2,B0009ESTDW,"This movie was as poor as the 1980's Dune sci fi flick.  I can't blame Tom Cruise for this, he did his usual journeyman job.  The script and plot were very hard to follow.  I'm a sci fi fan and can follow intricate and layered plots well, but this movie left me scratching my head.  Don't bother.",1376697600,,296,4.140350877192983
2287754,2,B0009ESTDW,"Just because I don't like Tom Cruise. No.

I like Tom Cruise. He's a yeoman. Good.

Still, crap movie. Over two hours of anyone's life sucked. If. They watched this movie all the way through. I did. And I learned a lot. Though I was sucked. Rudely. Sucked. Dare I say I paid for it, too? Four or five dollars. That I'll never have to spend again on something...else.

First of all, why are they still paying Tom Cruise to do anything in the category of suspense? If Tom Cruise is in it, you know it's going to end well for him whether he lives to die another day, or, as in the case of this movie, not. He's either a hero or a Saint. Comforting, if that's what you're into.

Then there was that whole stultifying middle part of the movie where there were (not just one but) two Tom Cruises. Wearing the same poorly designed costume. (and for this I had to wait two extra weeks 'til I could afford to watch how badly Tom Cruise would embarrass himself this time? why?)

I like Tome Cruise, but Tom Cruise is a bad actor. He sells tickets but, he's a bad actor. As an actor he doesn't know his limits (which is good), but he doesn't know what he's good at, either (which is not good).

In Oblivion he's taken on a story that requires stopping first; Cruise plunges ahead. Hold still, even if all he's got is a second, before firing. Know how to stop and hold still; Cruise can't.

Still, good for him for considering the possibility. Likewise, in his next movie, I hope he'll consider looking his age.

Ambitious movie. Over two hours. Beautiful design. But Tom Cruise was the bad actor at the center of it. So, one star for the design, one for doing a hard tell. Other wise three stars down on account of Tom Cruise is a bad actor.",1376697600,,1730,4.269113149847095

2287768,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is an interesting and refreshing entry in the Sci-Fi genre.  Lately the Sci-Fi films that have come out are mainly style over substance.  The Transformers films are ones that quickly come to mind.  I am a big fan of science fiction!  Oblivion and the new Star Trek movie are the two movies that I wanted to see most this summer.  I was not disappointed with this film!  Oblivion is a film that makes you think.  When I watched this film in the theater I did not fully understand what was going on.  When I thought about it more on the way home I began to piece everything together.  I like science fiction films that can do that.  This film reminded me of films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of the atmosphere and tone.  It also reminded me of films like Wall-e and I Am Legend.

The special effects of this movie are fantastic.  This film is able to create a beautiful looking world, and immersing the audience in it.  The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.

The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about.  Morgan Freeman's character is also likable.  The other characters though are pretty bland.

Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning.  There is not much action in this movie either.  The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it.  The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is.  However, I find Oblivion a very refreshing and enjoyable Sci-Fi film.",1376697600,2,1631,4.4576271186440675

2287771,4,B0009ESTDW,"This film is a post-modern take on ""Mother issues"", masquerading as the sci-fi. Freud had argued that the original sexual object for both sexes in the mother. In this film, our couple receives the orders from Sally, played by Melissa Leo. Sally is their commander and is stationed on a space station that orbits the Earth (or so it seems). Sally is an older woman, a thinly-veiled representation of the mother. The ordeal of Jack (Tom Cruise) is to go through tests orchestrated by Sally and to become a man. He is to become Vika's ""rescuer"". Psychoanalysts know that a man can lose all sexual attractiveness for a woman from the moment that he shows some sort of complicity with her mother. Vika's case is complicated by a love triangle, but the essence of the movie is this: Jack had to quit any compliance with the mother (plus mother-in-law, Sally was actually both) in order to become a man and a husband, albeit to another women. I recommend this film.",1376697600,,958,4.641176470588236
2287772,3,B0009ESTDW,"This is not really a review - many previous posters have done fine work in that area. What I wanted to comment on, since so many have commented on its lack of originality, is what I felt the protogenic sources to be.

Here goes - in no particular order:

Independence Day - ending's almost a rip-off - nuclear weapon smuggled into the alien mother ship for big bang ending. Not as much jaunty camaraderie as its precursor, but replete w/ verbal jousting vs.the captor(s).

The Time Machine - remake w/ Guy Pierce in which the moon is destroyed, causing all sorts of natural calamities.

Star Wars - the living quarters ""Towers 49 & 52"", are somewhat reminiscent of Bespin, the city in the clouds. The ""scavs"" are reminiscent of Ewoks w/ their distorted voices, and the Jawa, w/ their illuminated eyes; also evocative of the Tusken Warriors (Sand People) from Tatooine.

Alien/Aliens - Ripley was in cryosleep for 57 years; the Odyssey crew was in cold storage for 60 years.

I'm sure other viewers will see other antecedent films; maybe some Star Trek, Terminator, and of course, other Tom Cruise films, wherein he plays a similar character.

One brief comment about a somewhat confusing scene - having already met her, why does Morgan Freeman bother to introduce himself to Julia after his second-in-command, Sykes, in a previous scene, has already held a gun to her head, in Freeman's presence, and seemingly w/ his approval? Did this simply not make it to the film editors' attention?",1376697600,,1487,4.807843137254902

2287816,5,B0009ESTDW,"I almost didn't get this movie, because the critics tore it apart.  However, after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy it.  I am glad I did.

Everyone agrees that this movie is visually stunning.  It is, but let's get past that.  Right off the bat, you are made to think about what is happening.  You have the strange feeling that something isn't quite what it appears, but you don't know what.  Funny, but that is exactly the feeling of Tom Cruise's character.  Throughout the movie, it takes twists and turns that you didn't expect.

The video and audio are excellent.  The casting was great.  Look, if you need a guy with an intense stare that doesn't quite know what is going on, Tom Cruise is perfect.  If you need someone to project that he really does know what is going on, Morgan Freeman is the natural choice.  The rest of the cast Was excellent, each portraying their characters to a tee.  Special credit to Melissa Leo for adding some incipient creepiness which was fun to watch.

Now, why did I ignore all those one-star reviews?  First, those who said the movie was bad because they didn't understand it, put the blame in the wrong place.  Second, those who cried, ""bad science"", need to understand that the movie is entertainment, not education.  Sure, hydrogen is the most available element in the universe, but that does not prevent some visually interesting ways of obtaining it.  Yes, the story borrowed from other works.  The final destruction of the orbiting platform was straight out of ID4, but it made sense in the context of this movie, and that is what really matters.",1376697600,24,1606,4.647686832740214

I was immediately drawn into this movie and the gorgeous scenery, and the story line that Pulled you along for the ride.

The musical score is absolutely brilliant, great blend of bombastic brass sections and electronics (M83 is to thank for that). I highly recommend this film to science fiction fanatics and just movie goers who are interested in action films, it's quite an energetic ride and as always, Tom Cruise delivers a very good performance and so does the remainder of the supporting cast, especially Morgan Freeman, whose character is quite an interesting one.

At the very least, it is clear from the get-go that this is one of those stories where ""nothing is as it seems.""

Very much a Tom Cruise vanity piece, Oblivion follows Jack Harper, a man who is stationed on Earth with his co-worker and lover, Victoria. At some point in the past, aliens called ""Scavs"" attacked Earth for its precious resources. They succeeded in demolishing the moon, but humans won the war in a sort of petulant ""if we can't have it, no one can"" move by detonating all of their nukes, turning most of the planet into a radiated wasteland. The humans now live on Titan, getting most of their energy from huge devices that remain on Earth, sucking up what's left of the oceans for cold fusion. Scavs remain on the planet, mostly just being irritating and trying to destroy the water suckers. These Scavs are normally dealt with by a series of robotic drones, but like all things mechanical, the drones occasionally break. It is Jack and Victoria's job to monitor the drones, fix them when they need it, and otherwise just hang out looking impossibly sexy.

Of course, things are not what they seem.

The story is actually very well-constructed and shot beautifully, and although the tale's secrets are parceled out much more slowly than is necessary (the movie could've been about thirty minutes shorter), it does lend the film a classy sober quality that might've otherwise been made cartoonish with its almost too-slick sci-fi sleekness. Every performer does a great job, although the flick doesn't ask for a whole lot from its cast, and the story lasts longer than its credits. It's a movie that lingers in the mind, which is rare these days.

There are a few rough spots, but these come mostly at the end. The movie gets a bit pretentious as it nears its close, seeming to think it's deeper and more meaningful than it actually is. There's also a pretty significant plot hole when it comes to our Good Guy finally defeating our Bad Guy, and the movie engages in a last-minute, unsatisfying cop-out in its (unnecessary) bid for a completely happy ending.

I saw all the plot holes and the problems with the film, but the redeeming quality is the smoothness the characters glue this film together with. I was not looking forward to action scenes,the movie provided for the imaginative of the viewers. The movie provided plot twists that justified my attention and being there. I try not to ruin a movie for myself, even if the plot suggests an outcome. I sit back and repress the ideas I have and let the movie present them as they see fit. The thing this movie did for me, as compared to others is gave me room to think about what was going on between scenes. Yes, this was a movie that was a compiled bunch of ideas from other movies and such, but that's a management issue,and not the movies fault. I think the actors did the best with what they were given(sloppy mess maybe?) and executed well. The main problem and I've mentioned this before is that to present a good sci-fi, you must adopt a written work and then massage it. This was not done here and it shows. Still, this is light years ahead of Transformers, Battledshit, and Pacicifc Rum. I still ask producers with deep pockets to look at real stories like Tau Zero, The Mote in Gods Eye, and the Giants Novels specifically 'Inherit the Stars' for a blockbuster, major budget production that will leave the audience contemplating the ideals of the plot for weeks is not years. I am looking forward to Enders Game, although I don;t really consider that a real sci-fi masterpiece, but it should prove better than things like Pacific Rum and Battleship(aka stupidity).

2287851,4,B0009ESTDW,"Extrapolation basis: I like: Alien, 2001, The Matrix, Dark Star, Terminator, Trigun...

Unlike most movies advertised as sci-fi, Oblivion is a genuine science-fiction story in movie form. As opposed to such staples as the war movie (with aliens), the horror movie (with aliens), or the western (with ray guns).  Unfortunately I personally didn't find any of the characters really engaging, and the plot holes were impossible to ignore while watching it (and they multiply every time I think about it).  So as story-driven sci-fi I would give it only three stars, but I give it another star for its beautiful & constructive use of CGI, landscape, architecture and equipment.  If Ikea made sci-fi movies, they might look like this.  Uh... except for the costuming of the scavengers: Cliche, ugly AND implausible, and they double down on this mistake with a lame explanation in-movie.

My thought as the ending credits rolled was that Oblivion is a sci-fi short story, or at most a novella, trying to support a large-screen full-length movie, and it just doesn't have the lifting power for that job. ""Moon"" in some ways works the same territory but seems better scaled to its material.  Nonetheless, if you like science fiction, Oblivion an enjoyable 2 hours of very nice looking science-fictiony stuff happening on screen.

Furthermore, the drab, dull and boring love story portrayed in this film did nothing for the movie, accept destroy it. Morgan Freeman is way too powerful of an actor to be in a movie like this. This is why his roll was short lived. Morgan Freeman practically cancelled out Tom Cruise, and seemed out of place in a movie like this. Overall, the cutting edge CGI effects in this movie were stunning! And the sci-fi (futuristic other worldly) panoramic sky, land, and sea scape's were also very stunning and brilliant. There are some dull, dry and boring areas in this movie; however its sheer sophistication will hold your attention. Based on the impact of the high quality production of this movie, I have to give it a solid (5) star rating, even though its really a disappointment in the end. The storyline has numerous holes, and leaves you with more questions than answers...in actuality the movie really doesn't make any sense at all, and will leave you scratching your head. However, for the sake of pure entertainment, its great. This movie has NO similarities to Star Wars, Tron, and Transfromers...at all! But you (WILL) see profound influences from 2001 Space Odyssey...I can promise you that. Those are the facts. Thank you.",1376611200,,1594,4.796363636363636

2287884,3,B0009ESTDW,"This movie wasn't bad.  It could have been 30 minutes shorter, but it is entertaining.  The movie moves at a very slow pace, but not because it is building the suspense, and giving you the feeling of being in the movie.  Just because it is way too long.

The movie was actually a little boring.

There is one part, when Jack discovers the plot line, and you are expecting the action to start from that point, and become interesting.

However, there is a litte action scene, and then back to the dramatic dialogue between the man and woman, and more of the love story in a secure place.  It just didn't make sense.

There is no sense of urgency in the film.  Urgency first to discover sinister plot is going on.  Then once the plot is discovered, urgency to fix the problem of peril. Those are the types of things that keep you on the edge of your seat, and interested in watching a movie.

Jack and is partners characters aren't developed in the time before the plot becomes known.

I like Tom Cruise movies a lot.  I find MOST of his movies very good.

This movie could not be called an action film, nor a thought provoking flick.

The storyline is an intersting idea, but execution is very bland.

There are no unexpected plot twists, which you would expect from such a slow movie to unfold.

A sharp contrast to this film would be one of my favorite, Vanilla Sky.

Some of my favorite Tom Cruise movies have been Vanilla Sky, Magnolia, Jack Reacher, War of the Worlds(although it really fizzled out at the end), and Minority Report(a little corny, but watcheable)

If you want to watch it, there aren't any major holes in the story, just that the movie doesn't envoke much in the viewer.

If you are also someone that understands how our 'matrix' system works, how Birth Certificates define the way our society is structured, you will also understand why the creators of this movie have chosen the clone theme.

Some messages and 'wink winks' you might or might not have seen in the movie:

1) His number is 49. 4 + 9 = 13 -- 13 is a sacred masonic number

2) Mission communications screen has always the number 33 -- another masonic number

3) Drone 166 is the one who survives all the way to the end of the movie. 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 -- you get the idea.

4) Mission space base shaped as a pyramid capstone, but it's upside down.

5) Mission ""brains"" inside massive ship has an ""all seeing eye"" that is red.

6) Julia tells Jack ""You don't know who you are"" -- (If you understand the Birth Certificate scam, you know what this means)

7) Victoria, when confronted with reality, shouts ""I don't want to know!!!"" -- Is Victoria a reference to the population in general?

8) Mission says ""I created you Jack, I am your God"" -- You can take this message anyway you want.

9) Jack Harper at the end is number 52. 5 + 2 = 7 -- A sacred number in the Christian Bible.

There is more, but I won't spoil. If you watch the ""making of"" section, you'll also notice Freemason hand shakes when they meet in the music studio.

All in all this is an excellent movie, I'm glad some producers out there have done their homework when it comes to explaining (for those who want to hear about it) how this world really works.

If you are also someone that understands how our 'matrix' system works, how Birth Certificates define the way our society is structured, you will also understand why the creators of this movie have chosen the clone theme.

Some messages and 'wink winks' you might or might not have seen in the movie:

1) His number is 49. 4 + 9 = 13  --  13 is a sacred masonic number

2) Mission communications screen has always the number 33  -- another masonic number

3) Drone 166 is the one who survives all the way to the end of the movie. 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 -- you get the idea.

4) Mission space base shaped as a pyramid capstone, but it's upside down.

5) Mission ""brains"" inside massive ship has an ""all seeing eye"" that is red.

6) Julia tells Jack ""You don't know who you are"" -- (If you understand the Birth Certificate scam, you know what this means)

7) Victoria, when confronted with reality, shouts ""I don't want to know!!!"" -- Is Victoria a reference to the population in general?

8) Mission says ""I created you Jack, I am your God"" -- You can take this message anyway you want.

9) Jack Harper at the end is number 52. 5 + 2 = 7 -- A sacred number in the Christian Bible.

There is more, but I won't spoil. If you watch the ""making of"" section, you'll also notice Freemason hand shakes when they meet in the music studio.

All in all this is an excellent movie, I'm glad some producers out there have done their homework when it comes to explaining (for those who want to hear about it) how this world really works.",1376524800,3,1639,4.293159609120521

My husband had the same issue when trying to rent the cars movie for our son. Same Story starts and stops and then finally stopped playing altogether. So now Im looking to get reimbursed but besides the review button I cannot find out how to get contact customer service. This is absolutely ridiculous with all personalization of websites these days and I cant find the correct link to refund online purchases. It is Ludacris they have completely lost me as a customer.

2287931,3,B0009ESTDW,"The story is a little hard to follow, even though its predictable.  Either the story was meant to confuse or the editing left out details that could enhance the story line...As it stood, you have to dream up motives as Cruise seems to act as if he is alone in the movie...(big surprise, huh?) Anyway, its an OK mind number, for a rainy evening...as long as you don't think about it...",1376524800,,384,4.408450704225352

2287934,5,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a wonderful film with some great philosophical elements to ponder. In many ways, it is a parable that mirrors Genesis, where a ""perfect"" couple Jack and Victoria live with little worry in an Eden like state where all of their needs are supplied. They are ruled by an authoritative voice, telling them how to live and what to do, in the form of Sally. Their ""sin"" is that of curiosity, as Jack sought knowledge of the world, instead of his simple task to live well and perform menial tasks. His command is to perform Sally's bidding in obedience, ignorant of the past or even future.  Of course, the wakeup-call of that knowledge leads to rebellion, and ultimately expulsion.

I find it interesting with the analog that Sally is shown to be an incredibly powerful AI, instead of the expected alien beings, with a singular voice, even proclaiming to be Jack's creator and God. Sally shows some concern for Jack and Victoria, though, Sally is an angry and vengeful force when disobeyed, with her  drones sweeping in like angels from above to smite.

It begs the question if there was a different undertone to the story beyond the simple ""aliens invade and exterminate everyone"". Perhaps as an intelligent being, Sally chose two of Humanity's ""best"" to start the Earth anew, while whipping out the ""evil"" of the old world with floods and fire. Perhaps Sally was both malevolent and benevolent, instead of a simple destructive force as seen in the eyes of the human survivors fighting their war. If Sally had succeeded, would she have left Jack and Victoria to repopulate the Earth after she had gone?",1376524800,,1608,4.773381294964029
2287935,3,B0009ESTDW,"All of these stars are for the visuals because they are magnificent. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the film. The story is a mashup of MOON and DEJA VU without the suspense of either. Tom Cruise plays the same character he always plays, only flatter than usual. We never get to see the aliens. Bummer. Be sure you see this film on a big screen because the visual element is the star. Kudos to the folks who make this film look so good.",1376524800,,448,4.044943820224719
2287936,4,B0009ESTDW,"As someone with a design background, who loves graphic novels and video games it's virtually impossible for me not to see some value in this film. For me this is a gadget lover's movie; in this case the bubble ship. Never mind the story-line, it is paper thin. This movie is like one of those automobile ads where the vehicle for sale is shown in a variety of settings to show off its capabilities. After watching this film I wanted a bubble ship!!!

I'd like my ship to come with the cool sky-house, female not included. If possible, sky-house should have a real color pallet- all white is too bland and pass. My craft should have the motorcycle pull-out bay option, and if possible throw in a killer sound system. No bobble-head figure desired.

2287944,5,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is what science fiction should be.  It is about an idea not about action.  It is a story that makes you think.  Spoiler alert: We never see the aliens.

The mystery  and discovery aspect of the story makes it easy to ignore that water is about most abundant compound in the known universe, so there is no need for aliens to take it from our planet. But the nice thing is that is not important.  It is just a tool being used to tell the rest of  a far more interesting story.",1376524800,,483,4.129032258064516

2287949,5,B0009ESTDW,"Tom Cruise acted convincingly along with this minimal cast of characters. Each scene logically led to the next, and finally the conclusion with superb filming and convincing CG. On the edge-of-your-seat action. I had to stick with the movie without a break. There were no slow times for me. The cast of main characters, including one who only appeared on a monitor screen, fit their parts in the story.

This genre usually doesn't keep me watching. This, of course, was the lone exception.",1376438400,2,489,4.891566265060241
2287950,5,B0009ESTDW,"A lot of sci-fi movies nowadays are all about the CG and action. This movie had everything from CG, action, and more importantly an actual story.

2287951,3,B0009ESTDW,"I understand that some people will love something while others will hate it. Although this movie has some awesome CGI, the story was too slow and confusing for me.

The first 50 minutes of the movie is basically Tom and his ""girlfriend"". She sends him out on missions and he comes back. Nothing much more than that. Around that 50 minute mark, others appear in the movie and this is where it gets confusing. The makers of the movie just start throwing stuff at you from all sides.........all of a sudden Tom Cruise has a wife. Morgan Freeman shows up and tosses in some more confusion. Then there are two of Tom. By the way........Morgan Freeman's appearances are short and he is not in the movie very much.

Honestly, even til the very end, I had no idea what was happening. The only reason I continued watching the movie was the computer generated imagery. Not as great as ""OZ The Great And Powerful"" but still impressive. This movie has a lot of eye candy in it.

Plot, storyline, acting are all substandard. CGI is very well done and it alone gets the 3 stars. I really wish the movie was better because I love SciFi.",1376438400,,1121,4.458536585365854

Oblivion was a simple well acted Science Fiction movie. The plot was simple no hidden message, no political statement just simple fun to watch. I have decided to buy a copy of this movie and put it in my Science Fiction collection. I think this movie will become more popular over the years to come because it is a good easy movie to watch.",1376438400,,589,4.514018691588785

Good movie, Tom Cruise even though he gets flak for speaking a scum company Walmart or is into Scientology, he really is a good actor.  You have to watch this closely and watch the details.. no spoilers but the ending made me go ""WHAT?"".  Some parts of the movie on the acting side from Tom's 'teammate' made me cringe at times (being totally honest.. not that I can act...hate to critique when I can't even act myself but it was tough watching a few scenes..)

Generally Sci fi movies that are ""good"" are rare and a few friends said this movie was weird.  These friends being the general movie types who go to a movie just for a ride at a roller coaster..don't care much for details just want to be entertained..so for those types I'm not sure if I would recommend but if you are into science fiction movies; this one is a good one..I enjoyed it and the story was shown in a unique way.",1376438400,2,993,4.26063829787234

2287996,2,B0009ESTDW,"No wonder the movie tanked in the theaters.
The movie crept along and didn't have much to offer other than some cool visual effects.  Not enough to counter the lame, predictable plot and it's eventual ending.  We guessed the entire plot and ending perfectly, about 20 minutes into the movie.

I am surprised that Tom Cruise signed up to do something this lame.  He must be hurting for money or something.
Morgan Freeman only has 10, maybe 20 minutes of screen time, TOTAL.  The producers must have known that the movie was a bomb, so they had to use another big name star on the marquee to draw unsuspecting movie goers into the theaters.

I would avoid paying for this, and wait for the FX channel or Spike channel to show this for free.

2287997,3,B0009ESTDW,"This is not a great movie. It is a fairly interesting concept with really spectacular visuals and Tom Cruise acting as Tom Cruise, but it is the overly ambitious script that leaves the movie wanting.  It was just too derivative of too many other movies (warning Spoilerish):  the Matrix, Reign of Fire, Planet of the Apes, iRobot, and even a hint of The Truman Show with too many strands to pull together via too many plot holes to really be a cohesive project.  Morgan Freeman, perhaps too frail and old, is underused.  The ending is contrived and hoaky a la (Spoiler again!)... Independence Day.  The movie does a great job of immersing you in this new world and the thin mystery behind it is slowly, if not deftly, revealed over the course of the film.  It's fun escapism, but the film does not have much to say really, about the human condition.  Neither did Aliens I or II or Star Wars but great sci-fi films either introduce something entirely new and make a fictitious world very real with a great story to tell, or use that world as a backdrop to comment on something about mankind (Signs, for example, where the new world of aliens was used as a backdrop for how a torn and hurting family could come together and renew faith in each other and God).  One or both of those elements need to be present in sufficient quantity for a Sci-Fi film to move from ""Fun!"" to ""Amazing!""  ""Oblivion"" had some neat elements of a new world with very effective visuals and it had a little something to say about what makes a person human (memories? love? the will to survive?).  So that makes it a somewhat disappointing:  6/10. This film was fun and not amazing and a little bit of a missed opportunity.  Worth a rental for sure, but not in the pantheon.  Those who gave it 5 stars leave little room for actually great science fiction.",1376438400,5,1828,4.486404833836858
2287998,2,B0009ESTDW,"As a life-long fan of SciFi it is virtually impossible not to love Oblivion as a state-of-the art visual treat. My only dilemma - is it really possible to like it as a film? For many reasons, I remain conflicted. Without question the SFX are nonpareil, offering a visually stunning depiction of a circa 2077 discarded, dystopian earth now being harvested for its remaining natural resources. The population long since decamped to one of Saturn's moons Titan, leaving a skeleton crew of Sentinels to monitor the extraction machinery and exterminate the rag-tag remains of the ""Scavs"" who had invaded earth in the 2020's setting off our doomsday spiral. So far so good, especially the performance of Tom Cruise who as ""Jack,"" the sentinel with soul, has remarkably shed his trademarked action-hero disaffection and glowering for something they used to call acting back in the 20th century.

Honestly, I'd be engaged as well if Jack's George Jetson meets Paul Blart blue collarness allowed me to survey the planet from the ultimate, coolest penthouse ever conceived for film - a 25,000 foot suspended aerie complete with an infinity pool that is literally just that.

Consequently, the first 45 minutes of the film is pure CGI perfection. Desiccated Super Bowl stadia lie in ruins, Petrified, post-nuclear city scapes abound, drying sea beds are littered by rusted husks of oil tankers and cruise ships taunting us with the smug nostalgia of how great we had it back in 2015....

...now comes the hard part, telling a story that can stand-alone from the visual pyrotechnics. In the case of Oblivion, the narrative skills of the director, Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters, Karl Gagdusek and Michael Arndt, conspire to near failure, all too frequently relying on story elements that seem arbitrary and implausible.

Forget the Scavs and the political machinations on Titan, in an out of nowhere twist, ""Jack"" has discovered a radiation free, paradise valley that he regularly visits to lay back on the grass, fly-fish in a lake fully stocked with trout and boogie to an epic but very ancient stereo system whose turntable is constantly fed by a huge collection of near pristine 1970's classic rock vinyl that must have once belonged to Cruise's pal Cameron Crowe.

All around him the steel and rock from a wrecked civilization have been fused into apocalyptic sculpture but please be assured that the 110 year old Pet Sounds album cover is completely intact. An unforgivable stretch in logic even for a film that constantly begs it from you.

While I suspect this device is utilized to anchor the story for a contemporary audience, seeing Cruise in his Adirondack chair, sporting a faded Yankees cap while getting off on the Allman Brothers is a WTF bridge-too-far for a story-line that is already crammed and conflicted - in fact this entire arc was so strange, I fully expected Gene Kelly to show up in the next scene asking for directions to Brigadoon.

All in all Oblivion is a VISUAL masterpiece that must be seen. However, with the exception of a haunting score by M.8.3 you could just as easily lament that this deeply flawed script was ever made into a Talkie. Too bad, because Tom Cruise actually tried in this one.",1376438400,2,3220,4.929889298892989

2288008,5,B0009ESTDW,"This is the best Sci-Fi I've seen in decades. I don't often hand out praise. This movie was enjoyable to watch a dozen times when I received it and is highly recommended. An excellent cast although there was no chemistry with the actress who played Julia. Olga was not right for the part. She lacked the on screen presence and appeal and simply did not mesh with Cruise on screen. It wasn't any lack of acting. They simply lacked the chemistry needed for the role she played. They needed someone who stands out in a crowd and has sincerity in their eyes. I also think once the background story was known... it should have emphasized the fact that their marriage was kept secret from their crew and aerospace command center at the time which is why she wore the ring around her neck. It also should have included the fact that Vika had interests in him at the beginning and did not know about his marriage. Those two issues were not made clear.

I was delighted that there was no blood and gore for a change other than a stain on a shirt. So thank you to the director, writer and producers for not subjecting the audience to violent gore.

This was clearly the best set design I have ever seen when it came to the sky house. I found their front projection quite effective and visually stunning for both the audience and cast.

The story had some wonderful new ideas... and it might have been nice to have seen some scenes of the thousands who came to attack 50 years earlier.

This movie did have a unique story. A wonderful clean, futuristic design of architecture and high-tech devices. The intent to bring Sci-Fi back out into the sunlight is a concept I agree with. Over the years it had become dark and dirty and violent which is a turn off and most of us are sick and tired of those other grungy sci-fi's. While this did have some drone battle scenes (which were a bit long for my taste... but that's what fast forward is for) but some of the most important scenes were cut in favor of useless, prolonged drone battles inside a power plant and unnecessary CGI expense. Battle scenes are boring and monotonous & the audience is quite tired of them.

Hasn't anyone noticed that the blockbuster hit movies all had good personal stories, limited battle scenes and no dark, dank or grungy... hit movies like Independence Day. This movie is also one of the best movies in recent years.

In general it is the depth of the story, the characters & interaction, the cast and visual technologies which are important. Movies need the audience to invest their emotions. This movie aced the technology and clean futuristic architecture. The relationship with Vika was quite unique. She did a superb job of acting and nearly stole the entire film. The cast was excellent. The designs were beautiful as was the concept. I thought the writers approach to selling the story was a refreshing change from their usual antiquated script formats. I'm amazed it worked. I think more should have been done with Tet and we are more interested in seeing additional scenes of the condition of the cities and survivors survival attempts (like the grain crop concept in The Host) than barraging us with battles. This movie was very sparing about that so it was appreciated. Only 2 significant battle scenes which were fast forwarded through.

The 3 most glaring errors were the deleting of the archives scene where Morgan showed him the book of his career. In fact, there should have been more scenes of the archives and more on what they had salvaged. The second was a simple blunder in the script dialogue. Vika told Sally that she needed a drone to scout grid 17 and Sally responds that she is sending a drone to grid 22. Clearly... Sally should have sent the drone to grid 17. Grid 22 wasn't even mentioned in the conversation. Someone should have caught that either on editing or at least when prescreening the movie without talking through it... and someone might have heard the mistake. It was pretty glaring. And finally, to hear Morgan talking about waves and bedrock in Chicago was a bit ridiculous. While New York and San Francisco are on bedrock and next to an ocean for tidal waves... Chicago is not on bedrock as far as I know... I've drilled in all three areas... and certainly would not be subject to Tsunami's from the great lakes. Some wave action perhaps... but would not bury Chicago... so that was the third glaring error.

It was also obvious that Sally wasn't quite right in the first few minutes with the constant asking about being an ""effective team"". Her Texas accent was also waaay overdone. Plus, I would have waited a few minutes and established the future before doing the dream sequence rather than opening the movie with it. There also should have been more lighting in the lower level workshop. Most workshops are brightly lit. His should have been no different in that respect. But the set for their house was fabulous. I'd like to see all Sci-Fi's use projection screens like that.

Unlike some people who judge actors on their personal lives, those issues are of no interest and should not be an issue in regard to the success of a movie. I only care how they do on screen and I must say they were all terrific with the chemistry exception I noted.

However... we could have done without the cigar and the goggles on Morgan Freeman. It was not only ridiculous that he would still have access to Cigars after 50 years considering the planet was a wasteland... but it is about time to stop pushing tobacco products on our films. It is a gross affront to the audience especially when it has been banned in practically every building in the country... so what makes these filmmakers think we want to see some nasty cigar... especially Sci-Fi fans who usually have backgrounds in science, technology or engineering. Most of us know better than to smoke and don't enjoy watching it either. Prometheus did the same thing. It was offensive both times. Find a technology company to finance your sci-fi films. Microsoft or Sony or Toshiba, Apple or Verizon. Not tobacco companies. They should know that watching someone smoke only repulses people these days. It doesn't work like it did in the 40's. It does not make anyone want to smoke unless they are already addicted.

We probably could have done without the scene of the 3 drones in that dark, dripping, dingy power plant. I hope the Director and producers realize you exposed your crew and cast to dangerous PCB's and lead and sulfuric acid left behind in that abandoned plant you chose to film in. It can't be cleaned from the concrete floors. It seeps into the concrete floors and then rained down all over the cast and crew during filming. That particular dark, grungy site  also contradicted your intention to bring Sci-Fi back in to the sunlight.

I find it disturbing when the directors expose the cast and crew to hazardous and unpleasant conditions. What purpose did it serve to place that poor girl in a tank top in Iceland where she was freezing? It certainly didn't add to her appeal. And why would you allow your high dollar star to become injured? That knee or neck injury could affect him for the rest of his life. It was clear he was having great pain and difficulty walking on it during the library scene. The audience does  not require nor appreciate the actors being injured or subjected to miserable conditions. I think any directors who do this should be banned for life from working on any more films, regardless of how well the movie may have done. Injuring an actor is inexcusable and unnecessary. Their contracts should spell out that they are prohibited from engaging in precarious behavior which may result in injuries. In addition to the damage to the actor, it could bankrupt a studio and infuriate an audience over the gross inconsideration shown to the cast. NO movie is important enough to cause harm or discomfort to a cast... such as filming in 100 degree weather as Star Trek Generations did to 3 star actors who could have died from heat related heart attacks as did Clark Gable and John Candy under similar conditions... or like this movie... putting their actors on top of a mountain Cliff in Iceland. Cruise is over 51 and shouldn't be running up cliffs and high sand dunes if he doesn't want to end up like Ritter, Gable and Candy... despite how energetic he feels. Guys who go overboard to overdo everything to prove their youth are prime candidates for fatal heart attacks.

If you want Iceland... then green-screen it. We won't know the difference. Many of us have a long memory about damage to actors and stunt crews... Harry Potter's stunt double who is paralyzed. Vic Morrow and 2 children dead from a helicopter crash on set. Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet age 12 caused a life long back injury. William Shatner with Tinnitus. Ida Lupino, Wayne and crew from cancers after filming in fallout Nevada. I didn't look up any of these incidents. We do remember these incidents and it definitely needs to stop.

I'm willing to bet Cruise will require arthroscopic surgery on that knee in 5 years and will end up with stenosis from the neck hyperextension in less than 10 years just from that one library scene in this movie. Frankly, I don't think any movie is worth it.",1376352000,3,9273,4.6485661989017695

I found Morgan Freeman's character totally useless to the whole of the film, but I guess he was cast well with what he had to work with.  There are many Earth shattering moments in this film and the overall premise is OK, but I don't think Tom Cruise needs to continue making these types of films.  I mean, how many times can one man actually save the human race?  I prefer him in more realistic characters but it seems his bigger than life star status makes him think he has to be in bigger than life world saving movies.

It definitely seems to draw elements from other major films in the genre, but honestly, it's getting pretty difficult to be truly unique. Oblivion weaves together a number of common sci-fi elements, and does a good job of it.

Acting was good, Cruise was great as always. Morgan Freeman was a good choice as well.

If the negative reviews are getting you down on this film, and you're not a sci-fi superfan, I'd give it a shot. It's one of the better ones of this summer...",1376352000,,641,4.565217391304348

I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice in my 48 hour viewing period and will have to buy this movie on DVD as soon as the price drops a bit. This is a Sci-Fi for the thinking person and has more than a few extraordinary surprises built into it. For some it may start a little slow (no big booms or starship battles) but stick with it, it's a hell of a great story.

2288059,4,B0009ESTDW,"No action-adventure movie should held to the standard of a ""Citizen Kane.""  The genre is akin to a roller coaster ride: it provides entertaining thrills. There are of course minimum requirements for performances, dialogue, plot, and special effects. Oblivion achieve all in a workmanlike manner.  It may not be the finest of its type and it's not 100% original, but it's entertaining and far from the worst.  The CGI's are stunning, and the action proceeds logically.

Rottentomatoes gave it a 54% positive rating, marginally failing to achieve their ""fresh"" rating.  Perversely, Ridley Scott's muddled and illogical creature-feature, ""Prometheus"" was rated a 74% positive.  That should arguably call into question the reviewers' credibility.",1376352000,2,742,5.580357142857143

2288062,4,B0009ESTDW,"This is a glossy scifi flick with the obligatory twist toward the end.  Tom Cruise gives a standard, decent performance, and everyone else is fine.  He's of course far too old for his work/love partner in the movie, but that's standard Hollywood protocol.  (A female actor of his same age would be considered far too ""old"", for some reason).  Morgan Freeman, despite earning a spot on the poster/cover, has a very small role.

Everything looks great, the movie moves along at a pretty brisk pace, the twist isn't exactly jaw-dropping, but it provides something to do in the last third of the story. (if you've ready any amount of scifi short stories or pulp novels from the 60s - 80s that owe any kind of debt to Ray Bradbury or The Twilight Zone then the twist feels very standard, but I don't hold that against them).  I also don't think the purpose of the twist is to amaze anyone, it's just a plot point.

This isn't a bad movie at all, and I'd say it's pretty enjoyable.  I love big spectacle scifi flicks, so for me this one was good enough that I'll probably watch it again at some point.",1376352000,,1095,4.44

What sets this movie apart is that it actually had a plot, something that seems unique lately! I have enjoyed Tom Cruise's movies and feel that the critics tend to be really harsh in their reviews of his work. I liked his Mission Impossible movies, so I decided to watch Oblivion. Without spoiling it for other viewers, I'll just say this is a movie worth watching. It has unexpected twists in the plot that may surprise you.

It seems like any movie with Tom Cruise is all about Tom and how great and tough he is. This movie was all about Tom... It started out great but seemed quickly became drawn out. The story line was very interesting only to fade into scene after scene of Tom Cruise being a tough guy. This could have been such a great film and the effects were great.

AND even if Morgan Freeman was only in the movie a few seconds (they should have called it a cameo), he was unbelievable.  Really, you can't believe it's even him much less the character he's playing.

It is however, no wonder they didn't develop his character.  I mean, all Tom Cruise movies must have TOM CRUISE in every moment of the flick.

2288078,3,B0009ESTDW,"Yes, here is yet ANOTHER ""apocalyptic flick"" in a long list of other apocalyptic themed movies this year.

This movie is strange.  Set in 2077, on a ""war ravaged earth"", our hero Tom Cruise (Jack) and his partner Vicka have the important job of harvesting water and other ecological necessities for human's new place of residence, Titan.

Jack is the one who has to do the ""dirty work"" - going down to the ground to battle the ""Scavs"" that have taken over earth.  (The scavs are the aliens that waged the war on humans to begin with)...while Vicka, on the other hand (a woman who is way too neat and sexily dressed to really be believable in this type scenario, but oh well...) never leaves the tall luxurious tower they are stationed in.

Yes, they are romantically involved.

Is this movie interesting?  Yes, in it's own way.  It is certainly VISUALLY interesting, and Tom Cruise does a great job as the main character.  (Some men may find Vicka visually interesting, as well).

But is it INTERESTING?????  Well....sort of.  I mean, the movie does suck you in and holds your interest - although I did feel, at times, that there could have been ""more"" - more character development, more emotion...just ""MORE"".  However, I do feel the movie is worth watching ONCE....now would I watch it again?  Since I know all the little secrets and interesting twists (which I will not divulge) I can't see myself watching the flick again, any time soon.  It did seem to drag a bit in places too, unfortunately.

Over all, though, I would recommend seeing Oblivion at least once.  It's worth it.  Perhaps watch in on Pay Per View as opposed to purchasing.",1376265600,2,1642,4.662020905923345

Good casting all around.  Nice seeing Jaime Lannister from GoT too for a small part.  He had a lot of gravitas and presence in the screen time he did have.  Overall: great movie.

It was very slow moving at the beginning and by the time there was a little more action, I had lost interest in the characters.  There were a few surprise twists in the plot with a predictable ending. I should probably give it 2 stars but I'm a fan of the lead actors :)",1376179200,,370,4.111111111111111

The subject matter also may be a little over done - Planet of the Apes, Matrix, others but I still found a new feel to the plot, which had an Excellent twist.

I got bored and fell asleep the first time, but I figured it would hold my attention when I had company. Wrong. I woke up and my friend was looking at her phone instead. There is very little character development , if any. It's not good sci-fi at all. The drones are Star Wars throwbacks at best, and his hi tech bike is lame! Only Tom Cruise can fall several stories several times in a movie, but not even break a bone or limp afterwards. This is shallow nonsense. Just throwing Morgan Freeman in a movie these days is supposed to give it gravitas! Wrong. This was so predictable and lame -take a bit from Star Wars, Total Recall and The Matrix, take out the imagination, great or at least interesting dialogue and characters, and you get this plodding attempt at filmmaking. There are so many excellent sci-fi movies around now to settle for this lukewarm drivel. Determined to get my money's worth, I tried again, and forced myself to watch it. But then I realized that my time is worth more than I wasted renting this movie. I'm just glad that I did not buy it out right. As confusing as the Cloud Atlas was, it was at least interesting with characters to like or dislike. This movie was a waste on every level.",1376179200,5,1302,4.384297520661157

Would I have questioned my own reality in Jack's place?  Hard to say.  There was a wrongness in the feel about his relationship with Tiva from the beginning, the feeling they somehow did not belong together.

2288129,5,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion begins with a mystery and ends with a bang, but also a satisfying coda. I saw Oblivion in the theater, but did not fully appreciate it until just now at home. The audio has soft parts, with little more than soft wind blowing and bird chirps. In other places, there are combat explosions and gun fire. The multi-track audio includes the default 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio (48 kHz), other languages in lesser, lossy formats, and a music only track in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (96 kHz). The modern classical music track is another form of enjoyment that BD can bring to your A/V experience. I found the music wonderful, but for the dialog and effects, one must listen to the main audio track. In the theater, the audio was very loud, while at home, one may choose a pleasing volume level to hear the quality in both soft and loud passages.

The story spins out in bits. The main part starts with the two main characters, a drone repairman [Cruise's character] and his female comm officer. As it progresses, you come to understand the situation and characters more, although there are apparent dream sequences and/or flashbacks that are not explained at first. Near the end, in a flashback/blackbox replay sense, the arc of the historical story becomes clear. I have a sense of Bob Seeger's words in ""Against the Wind"", ""what to leave in, what to leave out"" about the pacing and content of the film. The extras include several omitted scenes that are interesting for what they additionally disclose about the story, from which one may consider why they were omitted. The director, Pete Hammond, also directed"" Tron: Legacy"" and was a producer for ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", to give some sense of the quality and sensibility of the movie.

The superb story starts simply - perhaps even a minimal, mystical sensibility, with the two main characters. Later another female character is discovered, after which the story starts snowballing. To avoid spoilers, I'll add little more. Yet, in how many movies does a quote from ancient Rome, from ""Lays of Ancient Rome"" by Lord Macaulay, ""how can man die better than facing fearful odds,"" serve both to educate or remind viewers of ancient Rome and advance the story line? This is a smaller story, rather than a grand tale with a cast of thousands. Yet, this is far more than a summer fun, sci-fi shoot-em-up. From the excellent video [note- the palette is somewhat subdued rather than bright Technicolor, to match the story and dystopian, post-war theme], through the fine story and excellent audio, this one is a keeper in my view. Sci-fi is best when it makes one think of possibilities, and this movie has it in spades.",1376179200,4,2665,4.741379310344827
2288130,3,B0009ESTDW,"The plot is somewhat unique, but there are some inconsistencies. How come the clones of Tom Cruise never ran into each other for the time they were tera farming the earth.

2288132,5,B0009ESTDW,"I was honestly not expecting to really enjoy this one, I had read a few reviews which knocked the film. However, if I recall correctly it was mostly because of lack of action... since when does a critic knock a film for ""LACK"" of action? Anyway, I enjoy the world and plot, as well as the action, in this sci-fi film.

2288139,4,B0009ESTDW,"This sci-fi flick was terrific. The space ship was a joy ride. Tom delivers yet another action-drama role in this post-apocalyptic tale. Unique story with grand scale and stellar visuals.  So glad I waited for blu-ray and avoided listening to reviews when this movie was in theaters.(Remember John Carter how they got that wrong!) Seeing it for myself and being my own critic, I absolutely give this movie 4 out of 5.

If you are a sci-fi fan I would say it would be essential for your library. Watching it the second time was more enjoyable, because I was more stimulated by the visuals the first time go through, the second time I was more in tune with the story line. Great balance between the two. Last but not least the soundtrack was amazing. One of the best I've heard in a sci-fi movie.",1376179200,3,794,4.506944444444445
2288140,5,B0009ESTDW,"I really enjoyed this movie because of the novel plot. Not overly done action or drama was a plus. The underlying message/ story line is unparallelled. Spoiler - This turned out to be a tale of one man and two wives. One was not a real wife and wanted to live in a small artificial and isolated world, the truth pushed out, where she hovered over her man, only allowing him the occasional escape to his man cave...cabin in the woods. With her as a partner, he was less than he was...more boy than man. Second wife was a true wife that he could bring into his man world and though not controlling, he was at his greatest with her in his world. He was man/hero in that world. She readily became part of his world and even after he was gone she remained there.",1376179200,,757,4.227586206896552
2288141,2,B0009ESTDW,"This was one of Tom's worst movies. The plot was never fully developed. The action looked computer generated. The whole premise of the movie was not clear and the purpose of all the clones was not developed.

2288144,5,B0009ESTDW,"A fresh story line in the Sci-fi genre is always worth a look. Combine that with great effects and excellent acting you have a really enjoyable movie. Whether or not you like Tom Cruise personally is irrelevant; he is a top notch actor who puts effort into his craft and it shows here. A good part of the movie involves Cruise in isolated situations and your interest is held throughout.

Just to give you a heads up: pay attention to the dialogue! If you get up to get a snack or go to the bathroom and don't pause the movie you may miss a crucial point and never figure out what's going on. There are subtle hints that things are not what they appear to be but you're not sure until you have the benefit of hindsight.

Basically, a fun way to spend a couple of hours and you'll give this movie some thought after its over.",1376179200,,824,4.24203821656051

2288150,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion wasn't bad. It had great visuals, solid acting and an OK twist. The narrative had a decent, slightly ""slower than it should have been"" pace.

The problem however, is that the characters were not fleshed out like they should have.

This movie had the potential to be an incredible franchise-starter, but it takes too much screen time trying to develop one character at a slow pace, instead of balancing out the time to develop what could have been an incredible supporting crew.

I still wish for a sequel, but it may never be...",1376179200,3,537,4.691489361702128
2288151,4,B0009ESTDW,"Not the best movie Cruise has ever made, but it has its moments. Morgan Freeman, as usual, is great. The rest of the cast is suitable for this type of flick. I don't see anybody winning any awards for it; there is just nothing really outstanding or new about it. Mean ol' aliens attack Earth, humanity fights back and in the words of Will Smith's character from Independence Day, ""Whoop ET's ass.""

A few plot twists that you might or might not see coming. Overall, a good flick to kill a couple of hours, but if you want to buy it, wait until you can get it cheap; or maybe rent it one more time if you're into watching it a movie more than once (I am).

2288161,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is only a imaginative, more expressive enemy boss away from being a certified classic. The visuals, sound fx, acting and score are all first rate. Even the idea of Cruise as a lone patrolman/repairman is well conceived, as his character slowly evolves from an optimistic boy scout into a reluctant revolutionary. My one gripe with the film is that after spending much of the movie building toward a confrontation with the enemy and the truth, which happens to be one and the same, the director elects to represent the big baddie as a faceless, featureless, expressionless machine. Cold, calculating logic is lethal to be sure but it's also not very interesting and does not give us the memorable villain that this movie desperately deserved. From the previews I had hoped that Freeman was the bad guy since we never get to see him in such roles and I can't help but think that this plot twist is probably what begin to calm my wild expectations. The ""scavs"" are human? Really? Wow. That could only mean that the real aliens must really be repulsive, menacing, mesmerizing and unforgettable. Right? Wrong. 2001 was a great movie but the whole computer/robot/intelligent machine as the villain is a let down of the lowest order.",1376179200,2,1235,4.85781990521327

It's probably worth watching just for the visual images created inside a cloud's worth of computers, so long as you can switch off all critical faculties and pretend that you're watching a montage. Otherwise this movie is just an infantile and irritating waste of time with more plot holes than a truly perforated Swiss cheese (and far more odiferous).

But you know what, ""Tom cruise only does A movies and he pours his soul into everything he does"".  I'm glad I purchased this movie and in blu ray, it's worthy of the blu ray treatment and it merits being in my collection.

PROS
-Strong actors (I don't just mean Tom but, Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Memissa Leo -- they were all fantastic actors in this)
-Strong characters
-Storyline that keeps giving
-Cool concept
-It's got Tom cruise (I'm one of those people that don't want to like Tom just because every second of his real-life life is examined under a microscope and marketed to the ends of the world...in end I do like the actor....he's a talented hardworking actor and deserves the A listing)  This movie brought me back to respecting the actor.
-Good character development (even the minor characters have a depth to them like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who only gets a few minutes on camera but wow does he make the best of them! And Victoria, wow, she and Tom have to carry a good third of the movie alone and together so she does a tremendous job here -- best supporting comes to mind.)

CONS
None

No spoilers here.  You really have to watch the movie. The aliens invade, we push them back, Tom cruise is some kind of drone repair guy.

Are there unanswered questions in the Movie?....yes most certainly but the movie is very good at helping you suspend disbelief with its strong visual portrayal, sound, strong acting.  To me two phrases are very important in sci fi: rational acting and plausible reality ---

- Are the actors doing rational things in the movie?  YES (If you're ask yourself during a movie, ""why did he do that? that's dumb! Then the actors are not acting rationally)

- Is the story plausible?  YES (it's science fiction but yes it's plausible and yes you have to suspend disbelief just a bit)

Some have compared this movie to Prometheus, a science fiction ""mess of a movie"" and it takes a lot for a guy like me to hang such a label on a movie....in Prometheus the actors are not doing rational things and the story is not really plausible (it makes no sense, the plot is not rational).  So it is categorically unfair to compare these two movies simply because both of their opening sequences are ""pretty"" in the visual sense.

Oblivion's actors by contrast are strong rational, a tight story & plot that keeps giving (and the story is plausible), that is a huge difference --- couple that with Tom Cruise and the Cast's strong acting & beautiful filming and you have quite literally a masterpiece of science fiction.

One final thing, some people critique that they figured it out pretty fast but I sincerely don't think the movie is meant to keep anything secret from the audience, a la sixth sense, I think it's a journey of discovery for Tom Cruise's character.  He's the one figuring things out.  We, the audience, are just along for the ride.",1376092800,3,3038,4.615241635687732

Held this up to the light and it's the most transparent Blu-ray I've ever seen, but clean and scratch free. Returned for another copy. That one didn't play. I heard that Universal had problems with the manufacturer. No kidding. I wondered if I should review it at all, and then remembered somebody who zinged a book because an entire printing run was missing some pages. I was glad they did; saved me the trouble of buying that book.

Tried a third version and it didn't work. Watched it on DVD instead. Enjoyable SF/Mystery movie filled with homages or cliches, take your pick. Afterwards I found that if I disabled the Internet connection, the Blu-ray would work. Universal tries to download new trailers and it locks up the system.

They briefly explained the alien invasion, did not fully explain why part of the land on earth was falsely marked radioactive, and did fully make clear the significance or deal with Jack's alter character.  Trite writing, cliche ending...maybe our bar is too high now for good sci fi plots.

The movie ""Moon"" actually did a better job with the same sort of theme as this movie. Movies where the puzzle pieces are revealed slowly and we are allowed to try and put them together are fine.

Having said that, this movie was like a successful meal.  I sat down hungry, no, I was Jonesing, for some sci-fi and decided to hold my nose during the scenes showing him as an action hero but as course after course was delivered by Morgan Freeman my hunger was sated and at the end I belched, pushed back from the table and felt satisfied.

The film is visually stunning, the action moves the story along, has some nice  nods to stories past (Drowned World, Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day and Planet of the Apes) it keeps the plot simple and moving forward efficiently and we learn the truth along with Tommy boy.

A lot of those films leave people wishing that the blood, sweat & GBs the filmmaker's hard drives weren't so depressingly put to waste. With Oblivion, this is NOT the case!
This film was so well done, it's hard to notice any familiar events and scenarios that take place while they happened, and it take away from the experience.
It's so elegantly sequenced that I simply didn't care if it had happened in a movie before!
Yes, there are a lot of movies out there, a lot of failed attempts to entertain. This movie did not at all fail to entertain me.
I rarely ever purchase a film before seeing it, (2nd time in my entire life, the first was Appleseed Ex Machina) & I'm glad I did with this one!
This was the best form of familiar in a movie. Instant classic!!

2288203,3,B0009ESTDW,"The best of standalone Tom Cruise has all been sci-fi in the last 10 years. Think about it. Ignore MI, which is a franchise. Now we are left with a string of hit-or-miss movies featuring old man Cruise struggling to look 25 after thousands of dollars invested in plastic surgery. Starting with Minority Report and continuing with War of the Worlds, Cruise has evolved into a sci-fi icon of sorts, very much like latter-day Charlton Heston. With Oblivion, which is essentially Top Gun plus 100 years of high-tech breakthroughs, the actor has come full circle.

The SFX are what you would expect from a movie with a $120M budget and two A-list stars. A visually stunning earth home that sits right above the clouds is where most of the melodrama takes place. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and surrogate wife Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) exchange smooches, awkward glances, and plenty of scenery chewing dialogue before Julia (Olga Kurylenko) intrudes to form one dysfunctional love triangle. At this point, I could only hope that Jack would throw Victoria off the side of their home in a sort of futuristic nod to Captain Stabbin, but the soon-to-be ex-surrogate wife is dispatched via droid instead.

Gaping logical flaws abound. Again, the home that is the setting for 2/3 of this film is situated above the clouds. With no guard rails. What if a strong gust of wind came and dragged one of the main characters off of the improbable structure? Also, I am pretty sure that in the next century, Earth's Stratosphere will still be pretty freaking cold! The surrogate couple swim around butt naked in their attached pool, while the accompanying outdoor temperature is likely below -60*F. Ice skating in Eskimo gear would be more reasonable.

There is some business with clones that I could not understand. Morgan Freeman fails to impress. Olga keeps her shirt on. Combine Moon and Prometheus and you will arrive at Oblivion, which is ultimately too milquetoast to leave a lasting impression. This is ""conservative"" sci-fi. Nice haircuts, just-ironed uniforms, and staunch patriotism give off a Jetsons vibe. But the overall flick carries as much depth as a puddle, which does not make for good post-apocalyptic cinema.",1376006400,,2216,5.0

Kosinski has produced a very believable environment and story. In the extra features Joseph Kosinski says something to the effect of, 'Science-Fiction has been pulled into the dark, I wanted to bring it back into the light again.' in reference to the feeling/setting of the movies.

It's slow, predictable and riddled with holes, but the production's cache of slick, attractive future tech and constant visual revelations make for excellent diversions. Cruise's sleekly designed equipment is a real science fiction goldmine, visionary in the same sense as Minority Report's giant touch-screen UIs, and the first hour is an outstanding lesson in world-building. The plot eventually falls into too many Cruise / mainstream Hollywood pitfalls, though, and borrows too liberally from other films. Duncan Jones's excellent Moon, in particular, is robbed of all but its subtlety, performances and locale. Still, such faults are hardly surprising by this point and if you were anticipating something more... well, maybe an adjustment in expectations is in order.

But in todays movie age, how many new ideas are out there? And when they are people or critics thrash it for some reason or other. Or the actor can't act in it or director is wrong for the movie.

True, you sort of saw it coming, but you weren't 100% sure until the final scene.  Critics were merciless with Morgan Freeman and I don't know why; they used terms like ""sleep-walking"" or ""just collecting his check"".  The fact is, his character was purposely understated in the plot and not the prime focus of the film anyway -- sort of a transitional but still key character none the less.

I LOVED that little jet-copter-thingy Cruise flew throughout much of the film -- way too cool! Kinda reminded me of that cool car he drove in the film Minority Report.  Whenever Tom Cruise is on the screen you can be assured there'll be plenty of cool gadgets & high tech stuff.

2288255,2,B0009ESTDW,"Reviewed by: Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"" I am not a fan of Matrix Sequels or Inception. I am, however, a fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey. That being said, the multiple dimensions, duplicate beings, aliens or humans question, time/mind travel galore and related ambiguities of 'Oblivion' irritated me. On the positive side, the reason I didn't give it one star, but rather two stars, is some of the visual and plot similarities to seventies space movies, such as A Space Odyssey.

To be fair, if you like to be left guessing at what is real or not in the movie, and are a fan of the movies I mentioned above, you may like this. There are parts that are comically far-fetched, and I must admit, I didn't need to understand those because they must have known it would be funny (we should hope).

****SPOILER ALERT: The thought of thousands of Tom Cruises roaming the earth is a plot twist that I would not like to ever see in real life -  as one of him is enough for the world to handle real-time. Also, Melissa Leo as a coquettish southern space-station monitor who is actually a hologram for a hexagonal space god was a bit over the top (not a good use of even slightly hinting at 'HAL' in 2001: A Space Odyssey) :P",1375920000,,1211,4.397321428571429
2288256,3,B0009ESTDW,"""Good"" - the special effects, including their skybase and the jetcopter, were visually stunning (which is expected from Hollywood).

""Bad"" - the props and the thin plot. Tom Cruise' uniform and his rifle are cheap and phony to the point of distraction. The uniform Tom Cruise wears is right out of The Day the Earth Stood Still.... the 1950's version, and the rifle is obviously light plastic as he throws it around like a wiffle ball bat.

By design, the setting was one of isolation and loneliness, unfortunately this was combined with a thin, uninspired plot which exacerbated the movie's weaknesses. The visuals were striking, but once I adjusted to this I was looking for more substance and plot, which were only partially delivered. Under the circumstances, a deeper, more intriguing plot was necessary.

The pace picked up somewhat near the end, with some nice twists, but even these were recognizable themes that leave you with the sense of ""I've seen this stuff before"". This movie needed more Morgan Freeman and little less Tom Cruise.

It is not a bad movie. I enjoyed it...somewhat, but it never grabbed me. I was initially amazed by the visuals, but as this wore off, I was left with mild indifference to the simple storyline. I've been on a multi-year rant about Hollywood blockbusters that spend countless millions on special effects and big name actors, but apparently spend very little on writing, and in my opinion this is another example of my gripe.

I was hoping for the best, but expecting the worst (I am still stinging from losing two hours of my life watching Cloud Atlas).  I really enjoyed this movie.

Good story, good action, great special effects.  It's not a top 10 movie for me (or even top 50), but it was well worth the watch.

I was curious why many people gave it a bad review and why it didn't do well in the theater.  I saw review titles mentioning plot holes and such.  For fear of ruining the enjoyment I had already received watching this movie, I didn't read those bad reviews.  I will catch continuity errors and plot holes in some movies, but not all, and those elements must not have been as apparent in this movie as others.

He appears to give all he's got to give his audience the best product he can produce, so that's the only reason I really watch what he does.
 He don't appear to be just walking through his roles just to make money, he looks like he likes what he does for a living, and that must be great because most people hate what the ""F"" they do for a living.
Also I've heard this movie was mostly filmed in Iceland, what a beautiful and brutal looking place. How the hell did the Vikings ever survive there?.
 Maybe that's the reason why they were such bad asses.
 I don't think I seen one tree there, it literally looks like another planet.

My biggest question lies with Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, who basically are world-class A+ legendary actors-- who get to do whatever they want. They don't even have to go in and audition-- they design their careers. So, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Cruise, you're pitched this script and you're sitting there in your living room reading it, What was it that spoke to you and said ""this is a story that needs to be told""?

2288262,5,B0009ESTDW,"REMEMBER HOW EXCITED you were to see ""Prometheus"" last year, the would-be prequel to ""Alien""? Remember the disappointment? Now check out Universal's ""Oblivion"" for a better story, characters we can like, and terrific visuals.

Yes - Tom Cruise adds another admirable science fiction film to a list that includes ""Minority Report,"" (2002) and ""War of the Worlds,"" (2005). ""Oblivion,"" from Universal Studios, plays to a smarter audience, requiring us to pay attention and think. I like that in a movie, no matter what the genre. I also like the co-stars - Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko.

Directed by Joseph Kosinski of ""Tron: Legacy,"" (2010), ""Oblivion"" is based on his story that was originally intended as a graphic novel. A sample chapter was handed out at the 2008 San Diego Comic Com. Cruise got a look and approached him to develop it as a film instead.

The story blends character with mystery, outstanding effects, and futuristic toys set in a ""beautiful desolation,"" as Kosinski calls his world. In the five-part making-of feature, he explains he was, ""inspired by shows I liked as a kid like ""The Twilight Zone,"" movies like ""Silent Running,"" ""Omega Man"" ...  [`70s films] with a small cast of characters, but big ideas.""

The year is 2077; the moon has been destroyed by invading aliens and, while the humans fought back and won, Earth has been destroyed by tidal waves, tsunamis, volcanoes and nuclear blasts. The surviving population now lives on Saturn's moon, Titan. Cruise and Riseborough's characters, Jack and Vika, have stayed behind to repair security drones and safeguard fusion converters emptying the oceans for transport to Titan via a massive mothership. Scavs - surviving aliens - are the problem, trying to sabotage these efforts. The two have been voluntarily mind-wiped to focus on their jobs, but Jack continues to experience flashbacks to a pre-invasion New York City and a woman he can't put a name to.

Kosinki's images were used by ""Oblivion's"" design department. One of the most important is a glass house, the Sky Tower, set on a very delicate foundation structure 2,000 feet above the Earth's surface. It took five months to figure out how the metal-supported design could be constructed, even though it was never built except as a set onstage.

The crew used front-screen project, a technique Stanley Kubrick developed for ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" By using this instead of green screen, cloud formations filmed 10,000 feet above sea level in HD, were front-projected on a circular screen surrounding the Sky Tower set. Glass and reflective surfaces, even the actors' eyes, reflect the skyscapes during scenes, creating an even deeper sense of visual authenticity. It looks perfect on the 1080p transfer. Detail throughout the film is absolutely flawless; it's definitely one of the best pictures to be found on Blu-ray this year.

Location filming was done in Iceland, where more of Kosinki's imagings, such as a Bubble Ship and streamlined motorcycle that fits inside, were created. A pilot, Cruise helped design a functioning interior for the gyro-spinning cockpit of the ship. The actor, who turned 50 during filming, received an ""Oblivion"" motorcycle to keep.

An immersive DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix utilizes surround speakers to their best effect. Dialogue, ambient sound, effects and a great score by M83 blend beautifully. One of the extra features is an isolated track in Dolby True HD 5.1 that allows us to watch the movie with its score alone.

Additional extras include four deleted scenes, which further explain a few movie moments, and a technical commentary by Kosinski and Cruise. Most of their information is covered in the splendid making-of series. As usual, don't watch the extras until after viewing the movie unless you like spoilers.

2288269,4,B0009ESTDW,"Universal Studios Home Entertainment brings ""Oblivion"" to Blu-ray and DVD for those who didn't get a chance to see it in theaters. Many people find Tom Cruise to be an acquired taste these days after his couch-jumping antics and Scientology beliefs became public knowledge. However, this beautiful sci-fi gem shouldn't be pushed away solely because he's the lead actor.

Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are the last remaining humans on the war-torn Earth. They're assigned to watch over powerful machines used to collect what's left of the planet's natural resources for use on a moon being colonized by the survivors of an alien invasion. As the job is wrapping up and it grows closer to time for them to leave and move on to their new lives, bizarre dreams and occurrences awaken Jack's suspicions about his mission and who he is.

Although the story isn't completely unique, ""Oblivion"" manages to borrow different concepts from several classic sci-fi films and blends them together to create something new and entertaining. Director Kosinski does a great job of paying homage to the genre, bringing to mind the visually stunning films of the 1970s and 1980s such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Alien,"" and ""Outland.""

""Oblivion"" is rated PG-13 for violence, adult language, and sexual situations. There's really nothing too horribly objectionable to be found. The box art states there's some nudity, but I didn't see where any actual body parts were shown.

The audio and video presentations for ""Oblivion"" will leave home audiences stunned. The crystal clear picture shows off the different landscapes and familiar monuments which have been laid waste by war. M83's score brings every sequence of drama and action to life through an immaculate 7.1 surround sound mix.

There are a few special features found on the Blu-ray version of ""Oblivion."" Audio commentary is provided by Director Joseph Kosinski and actor Tom Cruise. ""Promise of a New World"" is a 5-part ""Making of"" documentary that clocks in at 48 minutes. We also get four deleted and alternate scenes. A 5.1 surround presentation of M83's isolated score is included as well.

""Oblivion"" is an exciting mix of blockbuster action and sci-fi intellect. It's well-acted and serves as a tribute to the groundbreaking genre films of the past. An elegant audio and video feature presentation coupled with some satisfying special features makes this a worthy purchase for consumers.",1375920000,4,2478,5.167082294264339
2288270,5,B0009ESTDW,"Minor Spoilers through out:

One of the biggest complaints is that ""Oblivion"" borrows a lot from other movies. It's true, but a rather hypocritical reason to trash a movie when in fact just about every sci fi movie has been significantly influenced by its predecessors. The fact that it borrowed from other movies didn't bother me- ""Oblivion"" still has its own voice and unique look.

For all the critics who declare ""Oblivion"" is superficial, all style and no substance, I couldn't disagree more. ""Oblivion"" is an intelligent, symbolic and gorgeously filmed story. Like most intelligent sci fi, ""Oblivion"" explores age old philosophical questions of the human condition- do we have souls, do we have free will or are our fates predestined, etc.

One of the major themes of Oblivion is that the voices of authority may not be as benevolent and as trustworthy as we' like to believe, and that individual thought and scrutiny are crucial to preserving freedom and humanity. The TET is a physical manifestation / representation of that power that influences us: religion, politics, the mass media - depending on how you look at it.

Meanwhile, Jack and Victoria portray different ends of the power struggle: where he is eager, wants answers to the unknown, and is open to exploring new paths and breaking free from the chains that bind him, she is more concerned with doing what she is told, not rocking the boat, and sticking to the path that is set out before her without question or deviation. You could even take it a step futher and ask whether Jack and Victoria are merely acting the way they were MADE to act, or if they CHOOSE to act the way they do (the free will vs. predestination aspect). There is much beyond the surface story to enjoy and ponder on, for those who like that kind of thing. I can't wait to listen to the commentary for additional information.

Also this movie is very pleasant on the eyes and ears. One of the most stunning HD movies I've seen to date, with a beautiful musical score by M83 to match. The entire film, from story to soundtrack to visual f/x, all pulls together like an eloquent poem, something that few films successfully manage to achieve. Movies like Oblivion certainly won't be liked by everybody, and not everyone will see the ""eloquent poem"" that I saw: Some of my friends were as disenchanted with it as much as I was mesmerized by it. As for me, I think it's one of the better pure sci fi films I've seen in awhile.",1375920000,,2464,4.655172413793103
2288271,5,B0009ESTDW,"I picked up the latest Science-Fiction epic Oblivion. Sometimes I get a little worried buying  a movie sight unseen but this time it certainly did not disappoint! The movie stars Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman and was directed by Joseph Kosinski and based on his graphic novel of the same name. The movie is one of the apocalyptic films which displays the planet earth after it has been destroyed by aliens.

I have decided this will be a spoiler free review because I think this is a movie you really need to see for yourself and to see it unfold before you. I will give a basic synopsis of the plot. It is the year 2077, 60 years after earth was invaded by aliens. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria ""Vika"" Owen, played by the beautiful Andrea Riseborough, are the only ones on  after the invasion and they are there to repair drones that are fighting off the residual alien resistance. The surviving inhabitants of earth are living on Titan one of the moons of Saturn. Harper meets up with Malcolm Beech a resistance fighter played by the legendary Morgan Freeman (one of my very favorite actors) and he also begins to have flash backs to a time he was with a woman on the Empire State Building prior to the alien invasion. Things begin to unravel and we begin to see that appearances can be deceptive.

Pros: The cinematography and special effects are stellar. This movie is great eye candy but you do not get an overdose of it. The acting is great and two of my favorites, Cruise and Freeman, are in this film and do a fine job. This is my first time seeing Andrea Riseborough and I enjoyed her performance. She portrays a sense of vulnerability while also wanting to stay in denial concerning the things Jack is discovering. I do like the story. Some of the criticisms I have read that there are plot elements that we have seen in other movies. While I can agree with that assessment, I can also see that this is common in Hollywood movies. I am fine with movies that may have similar plot elements to other movies as long as it is executed well and that is the case with this movie. I also enjoy the story. The movie mixes romance, mystery and action adventure into a tale that will keep the viewer engaged and caring about all the characters throughout. Despite great special effects this is a very character driven movie.

Cons: I really have only one minor complaint. Director Kosinski wanted this movie to be an homage to the science fiction films of the 70s and in many way he succeeds in that endeavor. The movie is paced more like a film from the 70s and it is slower than the more kinetic pacing we modern viewers and grown accustomed to. Is that a fault of the directors or is it a fault of the viewer? I will place blame on myself. We live in a fast paced mircowave society that wants instant gratification. So it was hard to slow down and get absorbed into the story. I just wasn't used to it. So really this is not a con, it is just something that the viewer needs to be aware of when going in to the movie. It is an old-fashioned movie and as I think more on the pacing, it really does work even though some viewers might not be used to it.

This movie does have some good re watch capabilities for me. As a mystery there are clues throughout the movie and on more than one viewing you can pick up on these clues. In an era where science fiction films are heavy with CGI and are like cotton candy for the mind, this one is not. It will make you think and keep you on your toes.",1375920000,4,3511,4.328267477203648
2288272,4,B0009ESTDW,"I thought it was going to be a five star movie considering Alex Jones called it an Illuminati tour de force.  It is true that is the potential we face in the future (and now):  government deception and a war on humans and terra farming a planet for resources.  I and others liked the film, but something was missing.  Something I can't put my finger on.  So, I'll give it four stars.",1375920000,,383,4.263888888888889
2288273,4,B0009ESTDW,"I have no idea why this movie didn't do better in theaters. Unless of course people are just getting dimmer and can't grasp the films concept. Maybe that's why Sci-Fi in general has to try really hard to find an audience.

Big action filled blockbusters appeal to a large audience. But, fanciful stories with emotional content that require some level of contemplation on the part of the viewer? Good luck finding a handful with the intellectual energy to track it.

This film struck a good balance. It had brilliant special effects and the action sequences were well paced and appropriate to driving the film forward. The acting however is what made this film. Tom Cruise may be a few almonds shy of a full candy bar but good lord can that man act. His character, Jack Harper, is real, you want to relate him. I found myself ( I'm kind of a cynical person by the way) choked up at the end of the film but in a good way.

While Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are obviously the money draw in the picture they don't overshadow the supporting cast who also do equally well in driving the picture.

I started out renting this one. After seeing it, I know I want a copy. Rent it if you must but it's definitely worth the cost of taking up shelf space or memory on the hard drive.",1375920000,5,1272,4.377118644067797

No way was this a typical Cruise movie and Freeman's role was nothing more than an extended cameo appearance, they must have needed the money. Even though I knew the plot beforehand, it took a while to see where this thing was headed. It was dullsville for the first 30 to 45 minutes into this movie and took a while for the plot to actually present itself. It wasn't until Freeman's appearance that the direction of the movie actually unfolded and started to make a modicum of sense. My wife fell asleep halfway through.

2288276,5,B0009ESTDW,"I was not sure what to expect with this because I came into it not knowing anything more about the story than we had another future-earth-aftermath-of-some-event movie.  Generally we find what makes a movie ""unique"" within the first third so that the last 2/3 can be packed with action, chase, and very expected twists.  In this case the movie may seem slow but they are really making us work for the twist and it's pretty great when it lands.  Very solid flick.",1375920000,,462,4.609756097560975

Great effects, good acting, good directing, good production values, violence not too sickening- for me what's not to like?

Warning, though, Morgan Freemans scenes are brief and Tom Cruise looks old to me for really the first time. But all in all, ""Oblivion"" is fun!",1375920000,2,434,5.041666666666667
2288279,5,B0009ESTDW,"This movie is absolutely beautiful to watch and a delight to hear.  A new home theater demo-disc to be sure.  It is Sci-Fi but not necessarily an action movie.  There is a difference!  There are very action heavy scenes but the movie focuses more on the character and mood not the whiz bang action and explosions.  Tell me if this sounds familiar;  a movie comes out that is action based sci-fi and people complain that its vapid and soulless, then a sci-fi movie comes out that tries to be soulful or character driven and its panned as boring, yet if it succeeds as either of these it's called derivative!  I'm sick of sci-fi-nerd-hater culture!  If you like sci-fi without being an overly critical nit-picking hater then you should be able to find plenty in this movie to enjoy.  The cinematography alone is worth the price.  Is it perfect? No, but it is certainly not terrible or cringe worthy.",1375920000,3,897,4.620253164556962

2288282,1,B0009ESTDW,"I did not like this film. It was disorganized, very confusing, bad writing. One should not have to watch it more than once to try to uderstand it better. I really respect and enjoy these actors, Cruise, Freeman, but just not in this film. In this film they are tru heros with heart, but if I may, there was at least one segment where Freeman's character goes on a long speech like talk, solo, and all cast remain quiet as a mouse. I thought, this character is full of himself and likes hearing himself talk. It was similar to listening to him narrate a documentary. The producers should have cut that piece out to make him more likeable. The brunette actres, Olga, is so very pretty, her face and hair especially in this one, but she had very few words, it left me thinking perhaps she needs to work on her acting skills. In another film she played a silent warrior woman, I forget the title, it was pre middle ages timeline, she starred with Michael Fastbender, she nailed that role, great acting despite no words. She was good in that Bond film too. The plot in this Oblivion film to me was poorly done, too hard to follow, you had to work hard to understand, leaving you tired, with headache, wondering if this was a time and money waste to watch. In fact, on several occasions I often thought the film was about to end and it appeared to be winding down, and also it was dull, I think I was hoping it would end, it dragged on and on. If I knew what it was like, I would not have seen it even if for free. There was only one segment I liked, when Cruise was driving a small aircraft and was being chased by other craft, there was shooting between them, that was very exicting, but ended with an impossible scenario leaving me as a viewer insulted by the writers. The two main female characters were very easy on the eyes. Oh, and to top off the not so good on this film, was a silly female character with a southern accent which sounded very fake. She was somewhat of a manager role, wizard like, only seen on a tiny screen, calling the shots, but very unlikable, worse acting; again, if this film is very futuristic, it made you think, since in this film, earth is not the earth we once knew, then how in the world can one develop a southern accent if there is no such thing as the south; in fact, no East Coast community, no accents at all, because it is not the same USA or world for that matter. Someone else wrote, ""there is an explanation for that 'female wizard TV monitor screen bossy character', I thought, there should not be an explanation, we should get it, the first time. However I agreed, there is probably and explanation for everything in this film, but why bother, I do not want to dream up or think or create a book a story in my head while I watch it, if I did I would be a writer, instead I thought i would see this film for entertainment, that did not happen. There seemed to have been segments cut which left you with more questions that answers. It gets worse, the film seems to go back and forth in time so often, there is even a double or twin of one character, how did that happen?; so you need to figure that out too. You need to figure this out, that out, etc. and so on and so on. Such so it leaves your headache feel like your brain is being blown apart into "" oblivion."" So at least they picked a perfect title. I am still stunned and I am ashamed to admit to anyone that I saw this movie. I think I need to keep this secret to myself. Buyer, beware. Be kind to yourself, do not see this film, or else you will regret it. One final scary thought, as I began to write this review, I saw some folks gave it high stars ratings, liking it. I cannot imagine how or why, that was scary to me. I thought this film was more bad sci fi, not at all horror. Signed... -- Not smart enough for this film.",1375833600,4,3826,4.185636856368563

Also, if you are a Tom Cruise fan, you will love it as he dominates the screen throughout the movie. The story is good, the acting very good, and the cinematography and music is outstanding.
As we enter the digital age, we may see the end of blu-ray, dvd, etc but if Hollywood wants to continue to sell physical medium, then this is how you sell a product. The blu-ray menu is nice, the features very good but what makes this blu-ray standout is the isolated soundtrack. I love that feature and I have only one other movie like this which was a dvd. You won't get this with a digital copy. The movie studios should continue this and if they could bundle the soundtrack on CD with the movie and charge an extra $5.00, I think that would be a great idea. One of the Ghost In The Shell movies came bundled with the soundtrack CD and I was impressed. This movie is diffiently worth the current $20.00 price.",1375833600,5,1066,4.308457711442786

Tom Cruise is hard to buy as an action star at his age.  People in the movie are continually doing things that make no sense, kind of like the people who run upstairs in the horror movies.

Cruise rarely disappoints and can make even the worst writers look genius and olga K. from the bond film was great as well. As far as sci-fi goes, this film brings the genre back up unlike Prometheus which was an overall disappointment for most fans.

My husband wanted to see this film because sci-fi is his favorite film genre and he was curious about the film, I wasn't so sure I would be watching it with him, but since Tom Cruise is in it, I decided to watch it too, and I totally enjoyed it.  It's the kind of movie to discuss afterwards and then watch again, it's a very intelligent movie.  If you liked Solaris or Vanilla Sky ( with Tom Cruise) you will like this one.

2288298,4,B0009ESTDW,"I'll make this short and sweet :- the similarities in plot devices and parallels between Oblivion and Moon (2009) struck me immediately. They are not identical, but their premises are oblique - which is not meant as criticism as much as its meant as comparison. Where one features a presumed man isolated on a mining base on the moon, the other posits a presumed man on earth following an alien invasion. Both have memories of people and situations in the past which they can't quite identify. Both come to confront replicas of their own physical beings. Both discover that they are androids. Both ""sets"" of androids die. Etc. Their are other, rather fundamental differences. Oblivion's Hans Zimmer-like score is maddening and distracting in the extreme. As usual, where this kind of thing is concerned, the minimalism in the music should not be the pounding, ostinato-driven repetition - but the MINIMAL use of music so as to ENHANCE its effect when its presence is required. When the score is nothing but another layer of unchanging sound, it ceases to be music and becomes noise -  it destroys, utterly, the purpose and real magic of music. Moon is much more recondite in its use of music. All this said, the best comparison of the two films would be by way of musical simile: where Moon is like chamber music (small in scope - restricted in range), Oblivion is operatic. Both are fine in their own ways - and, my objections to the score for Oblivion notwithstanding, both films work in their own, distinctive ways.",1375833600,3,1518,4.793893129770993

I have high speed internet access, high enough that I can stream HD movies from Amazon without buffering, but the disc took almost 10 minutes to load, as it accessed the internet to download more bloody trailers, and being a Universal Disc, it would not let me bypass the previews by pressing Top Menu or Title Menu.

Tom Cruise gets a bad rap, and I think unfairly, because of some of his 'antics' and his religion. I don't really care about either. His antics have never hurt anyone and, so far as I know, his religion hasn't either. Yes, I know there are allegations of abuse but that is true of any religion and any atheist group, as well.

But he delivers yet again another terrific performance, something he has done more consistently than any actor over the past 30 years. The rest of the cast, but I have to point out maybe the most surprising performance in the film and right up there with Cruise, that of Andrea Riseborough as Victoria.

I think the 'scavs' were a disappointment, however, and that is why I take off half a star.

Yes, Morgan Freeman is good but they never seemed real to me within the confines of the universe the director had created. Small criticism since they really aren't as prominent as they should have been but no spoilers here. I was able to watch the film without any foreknowledge and I enjoyed it as such. I wouldn't want to ruin that for anyone.

The ending? There are great and surprising moments leading up to the penultimate scene in the film. It is an odd scene which is by turns stunning and somewhat pedantic. It didn't rise up to the level of the expectations I had built. But I enjoyed the ride so much getting there that I didn't matter. And I have to admit I did enjoy the very final scene even though I saw it coming.

The extras are very good. Tom Cruise is always interesting in his commentaries as he is here with the director. He is not just an actor playing a part. He puts real thought into the film and has great appreciation for everything involved in making a film as a skill.",1375747200,4,1965,4.340599455040872

I am glad that I watched it and I can recommend it wholeheartedly if you enjoyed movies like Blade Runner, Matrix or the early parts of The Island.  Tom Cruise is making some interesting moves these days.  I wrote him off. . .for reasons that don't need to be expounded. . .but after Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages and Oblivion I'm now more of a fan interested in seeing what kinds of choices he makes next.

2288329,5,B0009ESTDW,"Where Oblivion succeeds most is as a pure sensory experience.  I suggest you watch this film on the biggest screen possible with the volume loud - very few movies look or sound as good as this one does.  Three elements make this movie worth watching (and owning on blu-ray):

1. The Design - the technology and architecture is amazing.  You can tell that the production design was given a great deal of care (in fact, many of the designs come directly from the director's graphic novel).  I think the Bubbleship is an amazing vehicle and a great design.  Movies like this present exciting possibilities for what future technology might look like - and that's something I enjoy contemplating.

2. The Locations - I love when movies take you to places that you might never get to visit in person.  A lot of this movie was shot in real locations (in particular the amazing landscapes of Iceland), rather than on soundstages with bluescreen.  It's also interesting to see recognizable landmarks (the Pentagon, the Washington Monument, Empire State Building, etc) deserted and destroyed.  Of course, the destruction is all thanks to visual effects, but it looks very realistic.

3. The Soundtrack - the original music for the film was written by M83, and it's the best movie score of the year.  The soundtrack perfectly compliments the visuals.  In fact, the blu-ray has an isolated score so you can watch the movie with only the music (no dialogue or sound effects) - watching the movie this way illustrates how much of the story can be conveyed through the music alone.

A lot of the criticisms of the movie deal with the fact that the movie is derivative - that it borrows ideas from other films.  I would not dispute that claim; I would just say that not every movie is going to be groundbreaking in terms of story or plot.  I think there are enough ideas in this movie to keep it interesting - even if I've seen it all before, I haven't seen it quite like this.",1375660800,19,1961,4.6405797101449275

2288336,4,B0009ESTDW,"*Thoughts on Blu-Ray at the bottom*

Oblivion is a fun, if not particularly great sci-fi action film starring Tom Cruise from writer/director Joseph Kosinski.  A wonderful treat for the eyes, Oblivion manages to create a fun, visual spectacular sci-fi action flick, even if its story leaves something to be desired.

The opening narration of the film establishes that Earth has been attacked by an alien force.  Most of the population has evacuated Earth to create a colony on Titan.  Earth meanwhile is being terra formed to make conditions suitable for human life.  The orbital space station ""Tet"" oversees this process.  On the surface a cleanup crew of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) handle drone repair and fend off the alien Scavengers (""Scavs"" for short) who threaten the drones and power stations on the planet's surface.  They receive orders from Sally (Melissa Leo) aboard Tet, and is their sole human contact.

Jack is curious of his surroundings, and in his final two weeks of duty a series of events take place that cause him to question his mission.  After capsules containing human bodies fall from the sky and are destroyed by the drones he's been watching over he is thrust into a life or death struggle to discover to real fate of the planet, and its human population.

Oblivion reminded me an awful lot of the kind sci-fi movies made during the 1970s.  The movie has numerous twists and I'd say at a certain point you're either going to throw your hands up in frustration or simply accept that this is the kind of movie you're watching.  Oblivion feels right at home next to movies such as The Omega Man, Soylent Green, and Logan's Run, and if you go in expecting that kind of story you shouldn't be too disappointed.

Tom Cruise isn't breaking any new ground with his performance in Oblivion.  He's as good as he's ever been in the hero's role, but still, given the nature of the script there were a lot of directions they could have gone with this character.  Cruise gives the best performance in the film, but that isn't saying too much.  If they'd added some more internal conflict to the Jack Harper character I'm sure Cruise could have pulled it off and the movie would have been better for it.  As it is, this is you're pretty typical protagonist role for Tom Cruise.

It is the visuals and action sequences of Oblivion that really sell the picture.  As with his previous outing in TRON: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski proves he has an eye for striking sci-fi visuals and spectacular action.  When the story isn't breaking any new ground the visuals will keep you interested, if nothing else.  It just works.  Oblivion has some outstanding aerial battles involving Jack's ""Bubble Ship"" which really is a blast to watch.  From a design standpoint I  think the bubble ship Jack flies around is one of the coolest I've seen on film, looking like a cross between a helicopter and a dragonfly.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bubble ship winds up being the thing people remember most about this movie.

 As it is Oblivion, is an enjoyable sci-fi action movie.  If you're at all a fan of those old sci-fi movies where plot twists lie around every corner, exciting action sequences, and exciting sci-fi visuals odds are you'll enjoy Oblivion.

Blu-Ray:
The Blu-Ray release of Oblivion has great picture and sound.  Special features include a decent look into the making of the film.  What I valued most about the special features was the knowledge that many of Oblivion's effects were done in-camera.  In an age where CGI dominates almost every aspect of film this is refreshing, and further aids Kosinski in making Oblivion a tribute to 70s sci-fi. Also included are deleted scenes and a feature commentary by director Kosinski and Cruise, and an isolated soundtrack score.

Oblivion release will make great use of your Blu-Ray player, HDTV, and sound system.  I wish there'd been more material discussing the world of Oblivion, but it is a satisfying purchase. So, I'm going to give a thumbs up to Oblivion on Blu-Ray.",1375660800,2,4066,4.793103448275862

If you hate drones and the idea of mindless mechanized destruction you'll love it. If you love the Earth and believe in the triumph of love and the human spirit you will be uplifted (for a change).

What most people have been claiming about this movie is that it has many elements of innumerable other sci-fi movies. It's true, it has from small bits to colossal similarities in plot, filming, conclusion, and development from other titles. But it's not necessarily a copy, but a brilliant adaptation of what others have created.

People who have enjoyed titles like ""Alien"", ""Matrix"", ""Red Planet"", ""Avatar"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Star Wars"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A.I."" will surely enjoy this masterpiece.

When I first read about this movie and noted that Tom Cruse starred, I thought (like many others might) that Tom Cruise is anything but Sci-Fi material. His role in movies like Top Gun, MI (saga), Jack Reacher, and many other, wouldn't really make him suitable for this kind of film, but then again... Remember his appearance in Vanilla Sky, quite a great movie, and with similar elements to Oblivion.

All I can say about this movie is that it's suitable for anyone that loves Sci-Fi and Thrillers. I sustain my opinion of it as one of the greatest Sci-Fi titles since Matrix. And like Matrix, it is one movie that must be first-seen with as few (or none at all) spoilers at all.

As with rating, I'd say it is suitable for anyone down to 8 years old, there are some scenes that might qualify as violent, but they are minimal, since sound (explosions, alien sounds, machinery, etc.) is what enhances the violent scenes that might not be suitable for minors.

2288354,5,B0009ESTDW,"Technically flawless effects mixed with heavy synthesizer music in a movie about the last humans on Earth after an alien invasion.  It all combines for an awesome homage to some of the great genre movies - The Road Warrior, Escape from New York, Planet of the Apes, and even Logan's Run.

Though the movie has a great take on the concept - some would call it a twist - it does bog down a time or two because characters don't bother having necessary conversations when one expects them to do so.  I chalk this up to storytelling technique and it does allow for a better visual journey toward the answers.

A minor quibble is that the alien invasion is shown to have started in 2017 but the human technology shown to exist at that time is at least several decades away.  I'm not sure why that date was chosen when a movie set in the future could have been written for any period of time, but it certainly doesn't detract from one's enjoyment of the film.

One can tell the concept started as a graphic novel by taking in the amazing visuals of post apocalyptic America.  The flying chase sequence also has the hallmarks of storyboarded shots fleshed out to full motion effects.  Indeed, when I think back on the movie, a series of framed scenes pop out in my memory.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie.",1375574400,,1305,4.472573839662447

Loaded with trite messages about how bad humans are or how we screwed up the planet or some other tired overdone plot with all the distracting special effects the creators could junk into the frame at a time.  Instead I found myself really enjoying this movie.  It had very well done special effects that felt real and added to the story instead of becoming the focal point themselves.  The actors did a decent job, and the plot was familiar yet had some unique elements that kept it very entertaining and even gave it re-watch-ability.

I would definitely recommend anyone to buy if they have the least bit of interest in it. Tom Cruise played the role very good. I could feel the immersion in this film. Not so much from Morgan Freeman but he's not a big part of the movie. There's some really awesome sound effects that made me smile and the soundtrack is unbelievable.

2288369,5,B0009ESTDW,"This was a nice relief from what currently masquerades as Sci Fi these days. Great story, thin characters that allowed the story to shine thru and CGI that added to the story, rather than taking over from it.

I mention the CGI because when CGI is done right, it makes you want to have the device, be in the story and believe in the future tech. Too many movies these days have a story that falls flat on it's face, Then tries to make up for that with CGI.

Oblivion is CGI done just right, adding to this complex, but yet simply told story that will never fail to surprise you too. Watching it for the second time tonight!

From a writer's point of view, this is the retelling of the Moses story. When you watch this. look for the shapes that we know well from Egypt, the idea of Moses stopping the abuse of a slave by an over-seer and some other images that will tell you more. Won't spoil this for you, but there is more than meets the eye, in Oblivion's imagery.",1375401600,,966,4.210810810810811

All movies copy something from each other and what made this movie enjoyable was that the pieces fit well into the story.  I must commend the director Joseph Kosinski and his editor.  They did a marvelous job of movie pacing.  There are slow cerebral moments and then high paced action sequences and never once did I feel the story dragged down or got slow.

For a year of multiple science fiction movies from ""Into the Darkness"", ""Pacific Rim"", ""After Earth"", ""Robot and Frank"", and my much anticipated movie ""Elysium"", (There are others but these are what I've seen so far) I'd say this Oblivion so far is my favorite Sci-Fi movie this year.

Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi
April 19, 2013
USA
Director:Joseph Kosinski
Writers:Karl Gajdusek - screenplay, Michael Arndt - screenplay
Stars:Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, and Olga Kurylenko

Underrated SciFi as far as I am concerned.  Some critics may say there are parallels and similarities to other movies, but I didn't feel that and I have seen most the SciFi movies out there from the last sixty years.  Whether you are a fan of Cruise or Morgan or not, it doesn't matter.  The story is compelling enough to satisfy most SciFi fans.  I went into this with no more than a few glimpses of preview scenes and no idea of the ending at all.  Although had I known it would have detracted some from the experience, it still wouldn't take away from the overall story, acting, scenery, and special effects.  My step-daughter begged me to pause it whenever she left the room, and my wife was upset when she came downstairs and realized we were watching it without her.  I had bought this so my wife need not worry about viewing it, but my point is the ladies will enjoy this one too so be sure they are present.

A man and woman are left to finish mining the oceans before joining the rest of mankind on Jupiter's moon Titan.  They have both had memory wipes but the man is seeing flashbacks of another time.  He starts to question who he really is and does he really want to leave Earth.  What he finds out while fighting the alien scavengers will change mankind forever.

2288391,5,B0009ESTDW,"I saw a lot of negative reviews before watching this, and after seeing it, it left me wondering:  what the heck do people want?

It's so hard anymore to find something that is not derivative of something else coming out of Hollywood.  Was the plot completely unique?  Not completely.  Was it entertaining?  Yes, for me it was.  It was well executed, the special effects were very good.  I thought Tom did a good job, after reading several reviewers that didn't.  Some of those reviews were colored by their views on Tom's personal life and religious affinities.  Really?  I expect actors to entertain me.  If I were going to judge an actor by their politics, or world views, I would not enjoy a great many actors and actresses.  Similarly, I don't go into a movie looking to find plot holes or continuity errors.  I simply go to be entertained.  To take my mind off my life.

I've amended my original review with the benefit of hindsight.  This movie stuck with me, and I've viewed it several times since.  For me, it was simply a very well executed movie.  And, it was good Sci-Fi.  Much better, in my opinion, than a lot of the Sci-Fi that the Hollywood machine has offered lately.  I remain surprised by those that rate it so low.  I wonder if they're not really fans for the genre, or perhaps movie critic types?  My whole family really liked it.

So, entertaining? Check.  Good acting? Check.  Good special effects? Check.  Good directing?  Check.  Good story?  Yes, actually it was. It was derivative of other stories that have come before to some extent.  But the story had it's own vision.  Really, if you're going to whine about it not being completely unique, don't watch Hollywood movies.  It was unique enough, for me.  It was good Sci-Fi.  If you like Sci-Fi (and I love good Sci-Fi), I can't see why you'd come away not at least enjoying it.  For me, it was worth it.",1375228800,2,1881,4.543543543543543

In the end, Oblivion left as many questions open as it answered and it sailed too close to the sun.

2288419,4,B0009ESTDW,"A fantastic movie with everything a science fiction classic aught to have; Stunning special effects, a brisk yet atmospheric pace, ""aliens"" and technology, (and my personal favorite element of this film) an excellent soundtrack. The score is from the same creator that did the soundtrack for Tron Legacy with a haunting futuristic feel. The whole movie has a very entrancing atmosphere as the audience is introduced to a gritty post apocalyptic Earth strewn with the refuse and debris of it's former self. This is artistically contrasted with the very cool looking clean-cut and bold design of the technology the survivors use, who are left surveying this dying world. The plot is fairly typical with nothing totally unseen however, this movie does like to throw a handful of plot twists your way of which I personally have never been a big fan. It isn't terribly confusing, but it does give the sense that the film-maker is high on them-self for being such a clever little story teller. Anyways, all and all this is worth buying and I would definitely recommend a hi-def version with a quality sound system. As a science fiction buff, I certainly intend to add this to my small elite collection (which is actually saying something as I only buy what I consider the cream of the science-fiction crop).

Of course its got Tom Cruise playing the lead role of Jack.  Tom did a good job in this movie especially the action scenes, the motocross riding, and the confrontation scenes with the Scavs.  I was a little disappointed in his aha moment with Olga Kurylenko playing the role of Julia on the Empire State Building.  I mean really, the only thing he could say about a previous relationship was ""Thats Impossible""  over and over with little emotion?  Hmmmmm.  How would that make you feel?  How about some jumping up and down on Opra's couch!  Ok, that was a little harsh, but the rest of the movie he is flawless.  And how did Morgan Freeman do?  He was good, he played the role of outsmarting his enemy well with a smile, albeit somewhat hidden, but curiously given away in his new found cheek bones bulging with glee.... nearly permanently!  That's not a bad thing because it wasn't over done and quite refreshing actually. There is something that I would call more than determined when a person has a permanent smile - focused perhaps, knowing that you have finally figured out the enemy and can hardly contain yourself.  I was a little mystified of the pairing between Andrea Riseborough playing Victoria who is work partners with Tom Cruise playing the role of Jack.  Ok, she just seemed a little young I guess.  She looks beautiful of course, nearly twenty something yet work partners (who share the same house and bed) with Jack who looks, well at least 50 years old, but yet they seem to be an ""effective team"".  But what the heck do Aliens know anyways?  Which brings me to the next point.  The plot.  Yes, it was good and out of the box for sure.  I mean why send your brother aliens to battle when you can send... well, something else.  Doesn't that make more sense anyways?  Its what we do in our world right now.  And how about those special effects?  Truly, how do you get a 4000 square foot home complete with plexiglass bottom Olympic size pool, Airport tower, landing pad, medical bay, a shop to fix drones, and up 2000 to 3000 feet in the air supported on a single needle metal structure?  And have it look so freaking real?  Bravo!.... THATS IMPOSSIBLE!  LOL  5 stars! Or was that 49, 51 or 52 stars?",1375056000,3,2371,4.47196261682243

2288436,5,B0009ESTDW,"I can't remember how long it has been since I have seen a classic sci-fi movie. All the recent entries in the genre have been either superhero movies or bombastic-boom-boom-shoot-em-up-alien-invasion ones. And while Oblivion does tread familiar ground sometimes it gets 5 stars by comparison with its peers in the industry at the moment. On its own, it is technically superb with a great sweeping soundtrack, well presented minimalist art direction, stunning landscapes, great acting from a small and excellent cast and tight screenplay that keeps your attention (if you have been longing from a reprieve of movies with giant ball of fires every 2 minutes). This movie also manages to stand on its own without the need for sequels which probably means it gets another 5 stars just for that.

From the end credits, it seems that it has been adapted from an unpublished graphic novel and the writer of said novel directs this movie so I guess I saw his vision of his book. And it's only after I came here that I realized that he directed TRON Legacy too (another excellent movie). Hats off to Joseph Kosinski.

Whatever you think about Tom Cruise, he sure as heck can deliver a great action/sci-fi movie. This one revolves around him and he carries it effortlessly while displaying a wide variety of emotions ever so subtly. His supporting cast is very good in general but I thought that Andrea Risenborough displayed a wider set of emotions really well and it probably would have been better if she and Olga Kurylenko had switched roles. Morgan Freeman, Coster-Waldau and Leo deliver excellent performances with the little screen time they have and to be honest I really like movies where the director manages to make a story around a small set of characters work well.

This is a very good sci-fi movie. If you have ever read sci-fi short stories (Dick, Asimov etc.) and ever wondered how it would be on film, this would be a good example.",1375056000,3,1939,4.782089552238806

My only complaint on this movie was the fact that the first hour dragged on and was boring. Once it got into around 76 minutes in, that's when it started getting interesting. Decent movie, but i wouldn't buy this on DVD. I might check it out again. I thought the performances were great but i think the story needed to be more interesting.

This movie reminded me a bit of The Matrix movies and at the end more of Independence Day. Like i said before, it's a decent movie, but you really have to be patient and sit through the first hour in order to enjoy the movie.",1374969600,,672,4.291338582677166

2288441,1,B0009ESTDW,"I was prepared, after Minority Report, to be grudgingly impressed with Tom Cruise working in sci-fi. I was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, the writers on this one were purely awful. So while it's a very pretty film indeed, it has plot holes big enough to fly a spaceship through, and that ruined it for me.  I won't spoil it here in case someone else decides they want to watch it and ends up liking it, but honestly, it was an awful plot. About 10 other sci-fi movies have done these individual concepts better. It felt a bit like the origin of the term ""hack"" for writers: someone took a dozen other, better films, chopped them to bits, and randomly stuck those bits back together to make this. When it's done well it ends up being a ""mashup"" or ""x meets y"", but in this case, ""hack job"" is what comes to mind.

Not sure how they promoted this movie and whether maybe it was just the timing of it's release. So with that said, I wished I could have seen it on the big screen and not on my 42 inches LCD. Tom Cruse did a great job as always, I know some folks may not be Tom Cruse fans, but he makes you believe in the movie. If you have always enjoyed science fiction movies then this is a must see and an add to your personal collection. I can't imagine why any one would give this movie less than 5 stars. I guess there are just people out there that can never be happy. Don't let any of those negative reviewers swayed you from watching this movie. AND don't read any reviews that are spoiler alerts!

2288448,5,B0009ESTDW,"Incredible special effects, great story telling, and the best part is the fresh crisp feel you get while enjoying this movie. When you want to be living in that surreal world I think that's when the director delivered a great piece of science fiction. Its that world that we can't currently live in but would like to.

BTW - I saw a review about poor character development. Lets compare this to the recent Prometheus that probably achieves the same level of special effects and feel but spends a lot of time developing a bunch of characters i wasn't crazy about. Here in Oblivion you get all your answers at the end and all the characters are well... congruent. I always find it annoying when there's too much character development and you get something like a Dr. Jekyll Mr Hyde feel with a bunch of characters you don't care very much for. I'd rather just see a few characters fully explored than a bunch of GI Joe's where you know a ton of facts about but don't end up relating to them and seeing them die off doesn't really bother you at all.

I think a big part of good science fiction is that future world you want to show to the audience and spending too much time on multiple plots and character development takes away from it. Oblivion has the perfect balance.

Anyways, loved it want to see more movies like this. Certainly raises the bar for modern science fiction.",1374969600,5,1376,4.496
2288449,3,B0009ESTDW,"Two things struck me in the first hour of Universal's recent blockbuster Oblivion: The familiarity of its elements (at times iconic, at others clich) and the degree of physicality in so thoroughly digital a production. The first of these I was prompted for, by reviews that cited a derivative spirit in the film with few citing exactly what its screenplay was deriving from, or explaining why the makers of Oblivion - or any film, for that matter - should be faulted for the practice. The second aspect was harder to put my finger on; so much has changed - and in ways improved - in VFX in these first years of digital's victory over photo-chemical film. Was the sense of physicality `just me', or was it also in the product, as a document of actual, and not merely (i.e., excessively) computer generated events? This sense of substantive record in the film does indeed concern its staging. More significantly, it also concerns the two marriages of the film: the superficially genuine, fundamentally phony one of soldier-laborer Jack Harper (Cruise) with the more clerical half of his ""effective team,"" Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), and his diegetically genuine, yet distractingly cosmetic marriage to a Russian astronaut by the name of Ruskova.
  Exquisitely shot on the Cinealta F46 and Red Epic, Oblivion is one of the more visually arresting contributions to its genre, largely due to its reliance on natural light and exteriors. Even key interior scenes often feature exterior visuals against which actors perform in real time, and objects with reflective surfaces (numerous here) are shot without concern. Instead of employing green screen for the film's sky-high, glass house scenes, the F46's mechanical shutter allowed for flicker-free front projection of clouds, stars, etc  The cinematography also exploits Iceland's steely terrain and unusually long magic hour (from 6pm-1am, due to the island's northern position), yielding an embarrassment of landscape riches. It is primarily for this reason of exceptional staging and location - and despite occasionally rushed CGI - that it compares favorably with forebears The Quiet Earth (d. Geoff Murphy, 1984), Robinson Crusoe on Mars (d. Byron Haskin, 1964), The Omega Man (d. Boris Segal, 1971), Planet of the Apes (d. Franklin J. Schaffner, 1968), 2001: A Space Odyssey (d. Stanley Kubrick, 1968), Solaris (d. Andrei Tarkovsky, 1972), Zardoz (d. John Boorman, 1974), Demon Seed (d. Donald Cammell, 1977), Capricorn One (Peter Hyams, 1978), and Moon (d. Duncan Jones, 2009), as it claims little conceptual innovation. This is not necessarily a strike against the film - a characteristic of genre filmmaking is after all the repetition of form and theme - but it does command attention and perhaps a bit of research, and in this the many negative reviews, claiming weak writing, are remiss, and somewhat misleading. Excessive recourse to the grounding device (e.g., the dashboard bobble-head); exceedingly long action sequences (i.e., better suited to an action film, which this is not); the tired boomerism of Procol Harum's ""A Whiter Shade of Pale""; the lithe, supermodel wife (former supermodel Olga Kurylenko, now the vaguely exotic/Eastern love interest of several films, including this one); Morgan Freeman as the go-to black elder statesman; the pat homecoming... The easy choices of the production are many, but their essential error of familiarity (i.e., convention) at the expense of internal realism is perhaps mistaken for something native to the film's achievement, precisely because it effectively combines so many now familiar sources. A patchwork of perennial science-fiction tropes (e.g., first contact, the lost civilization, the ascendant machine, simulacra & virtuality), Oblivion draws from each of the titles just cited in various ways, perhaps most obviously from the red-eyed computer/Cyclops of Kubrick's 2001', though most heavily from Jones' Moon, itself a sci-fi hybrid (its own sources 2001' and Solaris, as well as Silent Running, d. Douglas Trumball, 1972, Dark Star, d. John Carpenter, 1974, and some measure of his father's ballad to Britain's also-ran space program, ""Space Oddity""). In another, more ironic parallel, Oblivion bears the title of a low budget space western from Charles Band's straight-to-video schlockmill, Full Moon Entertainment. Shot in Romania, Oblivion (d. Sam Irvin, 1994) takes place in the small town of Oblivion, on a distant planet on the interstellar frontier (in a nod to the Western expansion premise George Takei is one of a handful of bargain celebrities), and pivots on the mining exploits of an alien tyrant called ""Redeye."" The makers of the blockbuster Oblivion were likely aware of echoing the earlier title, but the reason this wouldn't concern them, and the reasons they might claim obliviousness (alas) are interesting, as the original Oblivion is not only cheaply and shoddily produced, but woefully derivative, in a manner that makes the better conceived, funded, and mounted Oblivion appear inspired.
  To return to the more substantial parallel, the protagonist's distance from the home world - whether spatial or temporal - is linked to the moon's destruction in Oblivion, and lunar mining in Duncan Jones' Moon, but the causal connection between the two sci-fi conceits is plain. What makes this connection curious - and potentially problematic - is the differing scale of each production, as Moon was astronomically cheaper, costing a mere $5 million compared to Oblivion's $120 million, suggesting a longstanding Hollywood tradition: throw enough money at a project, and its creative problem/s (in this case, clear derivation) are solved by an economics of scale. However, aside from its visuals - which reflect the film's artistry at least as much as its generous budgeting - there are two fairly unique themes that save Oblivion from itself - from what we might call its indistinction. These are the hi-tech war, in which the all/any-American is complicit, and the conflict of the celluloid/cellular (i.e., live/living), and digital/electronic (i.e., virtual), beginning with the nostalgic opening image of the Empire State Building's observation deck, a coin-operated pair of binoculars greeting us like an emissary of the medium on which it is shot - or appears to be shot. Though evident throughout the film due to the prominent role of lethal ""drones"" (in addition to ubiquitous surveillance, satellite mapping, heat-signature, and other video images and imaging of distant topography, figures, and events), the theme of telepresent war is clearest in the film's second half, when the elusive, desert-dwelling enemy capture Harper, force him to recognize their humanity, and coerce him to program one of the captured drones to attack its origin (the orbiting artificial intelligence Harper unwittingly serves). The other theme is more profound but less apparent, giving the film a weight just beneath conscious detection: the tenuous relationship between a film past of material means - a past at risk of oblivion, naturally represented by Cruise - and the current one of digital optimism, enfigured in the wife who dresses for work without leaving home (who in fact refuses to), and a CG rendering of a completed One World Trade Center, composited onto a healed New York, ripe for cataclysm and reified through the antiquated binoculars (n.b., from the deck of what was once the tallest skyscraper, and the first to suffer impact from an airplane). Blurred, but clearly the object of focus, an engagement ring is held up tentatively in the foreground, dwarfing the new tower. The form and tone of the essential conflict are perfectly united here. The trouble is in the proposition of such limited options for man and wife (not to mention viewer), when drawing from so vast a catalogue of futurist fiction. Ultimately, the nuclear family functions as a sort of punchline. Not a bad one, perhaps, but an exceedingly clean one - a choice, apparently, between Town and Country. Forget the ashes of your fathers and temples of your Gods, your cabin in the sky awaits. Or, if you prefer, the hidden valley of the LP.",1374969600,,8156,5.270769230769231

The premise was really good; the plot was a twist I did not even anticipate, but it was a really nice surprise for a sci-fi flick. The visuals and special effects are outstanding!

2288453,4,B0009ESTDW,"Sci-fi that involves Cruise or Travolta can be suspicious at times, but I thought this movie was worth watching.  I paid full price to get it here on AMZ, but it's better than sitting in a theater with noisy dolts.  The non-main characters are flat and quiet, but at 2 hours, there wasn't much time to get other characters yapping as well.

I love disaster movies and often think that earth would be better off without us, some of what I saw in this film reminded me of personal ideas and it's nice to see them out there in parallel.  Some reviews said that this movie was confusing and it had me wondering if the movie critic had any good brain cells left. If you want confusing double up on Inception and 12 Monkeys. Oblivion is fine, but it's not Memento or Butterfly Effect for worthy plot twists.

Don't look for a super tight story line, and I'm sure you'll find the same holes in the story that I did.  Some things can be explained if you just fill in the blanks yourself. For instance the life pod that gets reused for Julia, says ""Harper"" on the lid. They got it by going back to a site to reuse it. I'm leaving out the spoiler bits, but you get it.

Based on a graphic novel, it may not be truly novel fiction, but it certainly explores a story unseen in my memory. With tastes of Firefly, Moon, and others of the theme, it kept my interest. Freeman, Riseborough, and Cruise play their roles remarkably well and together make a great team. Eerie and with enough uncertainty to move the film along, Oblivion gets an A for freshness.
It unfortunately suffers from the occasional sense of solidarity of older Sci-Fi flicks like 2001 and a lack of answers and depth of other greats.

While some of the story drags a bit sappy, the film is very interesting as a whole and especially worthwhile visually.  It warrants a big screen/HD viewing.  I enjoyed the references to past sci fi flics.  Anyone that thinks the scenes are a ""rip off"" doesn't understand homage. They were about respect of the genre and fun to spy for those who know the references. The overall story may feel like it has holes but this film is very good because it is one to reflect upon.  In doing so, you can figure out why things were the way they were and that the holes were not as much as your initially thought.  The pacing of the film was good too- not overloaded with action like big budget bozo films, and not too hung up on slow story/character development.  It was a really good mix that, for me, now puts this film up there with my sci fi faves. [I would have liked to give it a 4 and half star rating]  By the way, in a small way Oblivion reminded me of an even better recent sci fi film- ""District 9"".

Do yourself a favor and go watch it. Don't go by those rotten reviews scattered all over the internet, this movie deserve 5, not because it has Tom Cruise only but the way post-apocalypse scenario is shown, whao.. beautifully told story.

2288469,1,B0009ESTDW,I am usually a big Tom Cruise movie fan but this movie may be his worst. This movie's plot is long and drawn out. We watched this with my extended family last week and half of them left before the movie was over. Has some backside nudity (pool scene)which may make it inappropriate for teens. The movie plot can be summarized by 4 words Captured--Cloned--Controlled-Overcome.,1374796800,5,375,4.7846153846153845
2288470,4,B0009ESTDW,"I would have given this a higher rating, but can't give half stars. Tom Cruise proves that he can still make a good movie, despite all the 'baggage'. I did find myself thinking about that during the movie, which was distracting. This was a good movie, nonetheless.

Additional details:

Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a drone maintenance technician in some future where mankind has had a war with an alien race. A war which has left the Earth mostly uninhabitable. A few technicians and their controllers remain on Earth to repair and maintain the automated drones that protect harvesters which create energy from seawater. The remaining humans are living either in the TET, a massive space station in orbit, or are orbiting Titan, a moon of Saturn. Once their tour is over, Tom and his controller, Victoria, are to transfer to the TET and then go to Titan. You see early on that Jack is dissatisfied with leaving the Earth, and finds beauty in small things, such as a flower growing in the midst of a massive desert. You also see that Victoria is a `ask no questions and do your job' personality. As the film progresses, this difference between the two characters becomes more and more evident. I don't want to spoil anything about the remainder of the movie's plot, so I'll leave it there.

The special effects in this movie are some of the best that I've ever seen, and the flight sequences of the `bubble ship' that cruise uses to go out to repair the drones, are awesome. I really enjoyed the behind the scenes footage that is included. The version that I purchased included the DVD, Blu-Ray, digital copy, and Vudu streamed version of the film, so having the proper player was no issue at all.",1374796800,,1698,4.653333333333333
2288471,5,B0009ESTDW,"I usually don't jump at the chance to see sci-fi movies, but I really enjoyed this one. Not as predictable as a lot of alien invasion/end of the world type movies out there. And after seeing it in the theatres, I still enjoyed watching it again at home, the tell-tale sign of a good movie in my book.",1374796800,,300,4.189655172413793
2288472,5,B0009ESTDW,"Hello everyone! Even though this is my first Amazon review, it is definitely not my first movie review. I must say that this was an AWESOME movie!

To start with, the casting was well done. Tom Cruise played a character named Jack, a clean- up crew guy who fixes drones. If you don't like Tom Cruise as an actor,then you can at least like the character he is playing. Jack is a totally believable character, a confused man trying to remember his life before his memory was wiped. While he would go out to fix drones, he would also try and find things that reminded him of his previous home. He can't exactly choose what he does, he kinda just has to do his job and then leave, which he really doesn't want to do. I like that about the movie; it always seems as though the characters are real, it was like Tom was born to play the role. The rest of the crew,consisting of familiar faces like Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurymento, also fit their roles quite nicely.

The plot was interesting, and I think the trailer explains it pretty thoroughly, but I'll tell you anyway. So there is the huge war between these aliens and humans, and (yay!) the humans win. They didn't really save the earth though... only half of it remains somewhat liveable. With what they are given, most of the human race moves to the Moon Titan, the one that revolves around Jupiter. As I said before, Jack comes along along with Victoria, both led by Sally, who have to clean up up Earth a bit and fix the drones that they made to analyse for the aliens. That's all I am going to say because I really don't want to spoil it for you.

The graphics surpassed all of my expectations, everything in the movie looked real. It was all so futuristic and high tech, but it all looked plausible. You felt like you were flying in that jet sometimes, and that was also a nice feature.

So, as a whole, I can't exactly tell you how I feel about every part of the movie, but I did enjoy myself while watching it. You should watch this movie if the following traits fit you: You are above 13 years of age(for violence, brief nudity, and language), you like sci-fi post-apocolyptic worlds, stuff that blows up, amazing graphics, and scenes that may make you cry from loveydoveyness.

5/5 stars!",1374710400,2,2249,4.409638554216867
2288473,2,B0009ESTDW,"By the end of this movie you will by asking a lot of questions.  Quite frankly, the story is incredibly thin.  And the characters pretty emotionless, though that may have been partly intentional.  The visual and technical aspects of the movie are amazing.  Great visuals and sound design.  It leads me to think this director, who also directed the more recent Tron remake, should perhaps be more of a visual effects director and not in charge of the whole film.  In the end the movie was pretty forgettable.",1374710400,4,507,4.704545454545454
2288474,2,B0009ESTDW,"I don't even know what to think about this movie.

 First of all, the trailer spoils the first major twist of the film. So already I was looking for twists. The 2nd twist *SPOILER*  directly rips off Moon and that's when I checked out.

This movie is basically a combination of Moon, Independence day, Total recall, The Matrix, Wall-e and maybe a little 2001 space odyssey and because of that it feels completely derivative. And the more I think about it, the less I like it.

Bottom line would be to go watch Moon, a much better film.",1374710400,4,535,4.418367346938775
2288475,2,B0009ESTDW,i am a huge tom cruise fan but this movie missed the mark.  no story.  hard to follow.  lack of action.  interesting plot but then to find out its a redux of space odyssey is defeating.  wanted to like it.  sat through the whole thing but really can't recommend it.,1374710400,5,265,4.2
2288476,4,B0009ESTDW,"I really loved this movie. I won't bother to go over the plot again as this has been covered in many different reviews and it would spoil things anyway. But, this movie left me in tears in the end. It accomplished what only the best science fiction is able to accomplish - use the genre to get the viewer to question basic premises and assumptions about his or her own life. The beauty of science fiction is that it can use aliens and new technologies as analogy to the questions we all face today that can get pedantic or dreary if it were set in the present day. A movie like District 9, although deeply flawed, can raise questions about our basic views of how we relate to those different from us, especially when they are in our power. Oblivion raises deeper, more philosophical questions: who am I really? What makes me myself? Why am I different from anyone else? Am I doing good in the world? Am I a good person? How do I know? Do I have a soul? If I do, what is it made of? What happens when I die?  Yes, the plot incorporated elements of many different works. So do they all. We all stand on the shoulders of giants. If a reviewer says that this movie is derivative and worn, I would accuse that reviewer of simply missing the point. Don't trust every negative review you see. It reminds me of something Lex Luthor said in the original Superman movie - to paraphrase: some people can read War and Peace and think that it's just another adventure novel. Others can read the label of a bubblegum wrapper and get the meaning of life.  This movie is awesome. Just trust me on this one.",1374710400,72,1590,4.31438127090301

I was really surprised how good the movie was. I love SciFi but have been disappointed in much of the recent crop that has come out. Oblivion had a unique story with a couple of good twists.

Even people that are not SciFi fans will enjoy the story if you like a little suspense and mystery. Definitely worth a rental!",1374710400,19,487,4.072916666666667
2288478,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a great film for science fiction aficionados, and it certainly doesn't fail to deliver a captivating world with unique and well developed characters -- most of the characters are well developed that is, though some definitely fall short. With a beautiful soundtrack to match -- which at times can get a little overpowering -- this is an all around great movie. It's not perfect, there are a few plot-holes at times. However, my problem with this movie was that the trailer revealed way too much information. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say this:

I understand Morgan Freeman can be a huge selling point to a movie, but revealing his character took a level of surprise completely out of the movie, and actually ended up making the movie's general plot far too predictable. The movie tries to evoke a sense of mystery and intrigue for the first beginning portion. However, having seen the trailer, and being able to piece one and two together, your best educated guess about what's going to happen in the movie is most likely correct. It's a shame, I usually love piecing things together as I watch a movie, but they definitely should have held back more in the trailer.

As a side note, Morgan Freeman's role could have literally been played by anyone and it wouldn't have made a difference. Morgan Freeman is a badass actor, but he really didn't need to be in this movie.",1374710400,2,1398,4.678861788617886

Not 4 stars as compared to say, Dead Man by Jarmusch or Chinatown or Bergman films..  4 stars means that if your a fan of the genre and you are dying to watch something that doesn't make you groan, watch this.

 Much like the recent ""Dredd"" or ""Pandorum"" from '09, this one is quite enjoyable. Good effects, decent story and not complete drivel. Hollywood serves up a ton of high budget crap.

No aspects were obviously lacking, though some questions the audience may have (less pressing, I suppose) do go unanswered, though the biggest plot points obtain resolution.

My disdain for this movie is not that I ""didn't get it"".  It was simply the worst movie and I should have known that when we entered the theater.  I had a house guest (a very well known artist from NYC) and we decided to catch a movie.  When we took our seats for this movie we noticed that we were the only two people in the room and given that it was only the second week the movie had been out and given the fact that it was a Friday night in a suburb of Nashville, TN we should have known it was going to be a stinker.  Not only was it a stinker....it was a MAJOR STINKER.  These people who write these redeeming reviews for this film must work for the distributor of the film, the studio that made the film or be friends with one of the production or acting staff of the movie.

I have a masters degree from GeoTown Univ and I am not one who is ""failing to appreciate the uniqueness of the film"".  It was a piece of garbage and I would be very surprised if it is not the beginning of the end of Tom Cruise's aging career.  The only surprise in the film was that Morgan Freeman accepted a role in the film.

2288499,3,B0009ESTDW,"Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works on a now-abandoned Earth as a security guy / repairman who lives on a platform in the sky with his co-worker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough).  Every day he hops in his little space ship and repairs the security droids that patrol the earth below, ensuring that the massive natural resources extractors continue to function and send those resources back to Titan, where all of Earth's inhabitants now live.  This is a difficult movie to review as there are several twists and turns and I don't want to ruin it for you -- so I won't really tell you who Morgan Freeman is or what he does.  Jack has a bunch of flashbacks to a pre-war Earth and even has some sort of idyllic Yosemite-like park to escape to, complete with a cabin furnished with an old stereo, turntable, and classic records including Creedence Clearwater Revival and... Asia.  However this isn't a music review.

I've never been much of a Tom Cruise fan, but in many ways he is very well-suited to this role (i.e. someone who has had his brain wiped and doesn't really know what's going on).  [Sorry if that sounds rude, not my intention]  His rather stiff acting style and inability to really create characters with warmth or depth actually works here.

The running time is 126 minutes but I swear it felt like 180.  There are definitely moments where you want to hit fast-forward but given that each scene reveals another piece of the puzzle you don't really want to do that.  I think the film would have benefited from a little more editing.

Overall I'd probably say 3.5 out of 5 stars... the fact that I'm still thinking about it and decided to write this review is a good sign.  It's one of those movies like the Sixth Sense where you might want to go back and view it again once you know the whole story.

Special effects are very good, and the landscapes of a post-apocalyptic earth are pretty striking.  Fortunately there's not the requisite destroyed Statue of Liberty however you do get a glimpse of her in one of the chase scenes.  And she's not in such good shape.  Jack's apartment in the sky is super cool, as his his space ship.  If Frank Lloyd Wright designed houses in the sky, this might be it.

Would I ""buy"" this movie and add to my collection?  Probably not.  But a good rainy day film, and one that will leave you thinking.",1374364800,11,2338,4.521428571428571
2288500,5,B0009ESTDW,"I am a picky sci-fi elitist viewer.  I admit it.  To prove it, I opine that the only good Star Trek (of the Shatner vintage) was ""Wrath of Khan"".  The others varied from ""sucks"" to ""really sucks.""  (The new cast though is excellent with Chris Pine at the helm.)  And, the only good Alien franchise films were 1 & 2.  The rest-drivel for plebes.  It takes a lot to win me over.  Don't even ask about Will Smith's pitiful attempts in any of his serious stabs at sci-fi.  Drivel and dross.  (Though ""Men in Black"" was good as a sci-fi satire.)  Harry Potter?  All suck.  The ""Star Wars"" franchise films started with a bang and then made me want to tear off my ears with the bad acting.  ""Avatar"" was eye candy, but largely just Pocahontas with Dragons.  The last really great sci-fi film was James Cameron's ""The Abyss"", but only the Director's cut as the theatrical release...you guessed it...sucked!  Yeah, I'm picky and a snob.  So sue me.  I admire ""Soylent Green"", original ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Omega Man"" just because they were novel in their day and had Charlton Heston.  (Heston always gets at least a nod of admiration because,... well, it's Heston.)  But even they were dated.  My standards are high and so I went to ""Oblivion"" in the ""cheap theater"", just 3 weeks before its release on DVD/Blu Ray.  Frankly, with only a low 53% from Rotten Tomatoes, I expected very little.  Boy was I wrong.

Tom Cruise, always dedicated to whatever project he's doing, has pulled it off.  In spades!  This film is tight enough to float like an aircraft carrier in any storm.  The plot is both intriguing and confident enough to play out over the entire length of the movie.  Gradual reveals with respect for a discerning audience.  It is not ""derivative"",--a word critics use to sound high brow-- as frankly this combo of plot twists, surprises, and tempered revelations never creates a hole in the plot.  And I've never seen it done before.  A totally new take on earth apocalypse and Alien invasion.  And it's unique in making the Alien master-race ominous yet virtually never appearing on screen.  The facts are layered in discovery, just as they would be to the viewpoint of Cruise, the hero of the story.  The emotions are credible.  The audience is presumed to have brains.  I suspect the negative reviews I've read were because it is not a sound-bite movie.  It expects you to think and take hints without forcing you to come to the director's conclusion all at once.  The acting superb.  Kudos to all the principles, which really is confined to just 3 actors.  Morgan Freeman appears briefly but in a pivotal role.  The rest of this story rests on the backs of just 3 main characters.  Yet this epic sci-fi film is far from claustrophobic and is anything but ""small"".  It literally encompasses the entire earth.  The cinematography is grand.  The story is compelling and commands empathy.  The heroism is realistically portrayed.  The plot and writing are superb.  There were a few very minor script tweaks I would have made, which I can't say or it would spoil the plot twists.  In fact, though the main ""reveal"" occurs about 2/3rds of the way into the film, even the last 5 minutes still give little, welcomed, and faithful-to-the-plot surprises.  It has just the right blend of drama, action, wisdom, shock and humanity to rate 5 of 5 stars from me.  Yes!  From me.  A great film.  If you just want sci-fi schlock, stick to ""2012"", or ""Independence Day.""  But if you want a quality film that you can see over and over and still enjoy, you can't do better than ""Oblivion""!  A nearly flawless sci-fi classic that will stand the test of time.  Don't miss this film or I will mock you for sucking.",1373846400,6,3703,4.610769230769231

The movie was awfully boring and there wasn't a lot of action. I was confused a lot and had to keep up with all the different copies of Tom cruise. The ending was ridiculous and not very thought provoked. There was so much more they could do with this movie. It was very long and very boring, and I was happy when it ended.

2288506,3,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is one of those movies where so many scenes are a potential bathroom break and if it were edited more aggressively could have been collapsed down to about an hour. The film opens on a 2 minute voice over from Tom explaining things to the audience, followed by a dialog desert for the next 30 minutes, then it twists into a frenzied, quasi love story that taps into Total Recall territory. It's a strangely soulness film, presumably to reflect the loneliness of living in the new world's reality, but as a result it's hard to connect to any of the major characters.

Aside from the beautiful apartment in the sky that would send anyone with vertigo into a constant state of anxiety, the production design is fairly derivative of other sci-fi (Total Recall, Wall-E, the Matrix, etc.) Without giving too much away, there are fairly major plot holes and when they finally drop the big surprise, it's pretty clear that somebody thought that ripping off ""Moon"" as an action film would be a good idea. Although Oblivion looks good and it's a little more introspective than a typical Cruise blockbuster, it's ultimately a bit vapid and is easily forgettable.",1371686400,4,1159,4.795

2288509,4,B0009ESTDW,"With great production values, beautifully-shot photography and the fine performance from Tom Cruise, ""Oblivion"" should have been a masterpiece. However, while it manages to entertain throughout its rather lengthy 124 minutes, the sci-fi action film fails to fulfill its considerable potential.

Set in the year 2077, after the all-out war with the space aliens ""The Scavengers,"" Earth is now virtually inhabitable. While most of the surviving humans migrated to Titan, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) remains on Earth as a repairman of drones intended to wipe out the remaining ""Scavs."" His mandatory work is interrupted when he rescues Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a ""dream woman"" Jack frequently meets in his dreams.

Sounds familiar? That ""Oblivion"" borrowed so many ideas from other sci-fi movies didn't bother me. The problem is that in his sophomore work as a director Joseph Kosinski (""TRON: Legacy"") recycled these ideas in a not-so-creative manner. Each piece is fine, but they do not add up when put together. Hence there are so many strange plot holes. We have to believe that those space aliens that can destroy the moon cannot foresee and prevent Jack Harper's next move after he knows what is really going on.

And probably most viewers would realize what is really going on Earth faster than Jack does. Even so, ""Oblivion"" is still an enjoyable ride, but with a little more imagination this could have been a much more unique and original action movie.",1371168000,5,1455,5.105042016806722

Oblivion is no exception. Add him to the amazing visuals of this movie, a cool (kind of unique) story, and Morgan Freeman (can you go wrong with Mr. Freeman?), and incredible soundtrack and you can't lose.

It's just too bad that an equal amount didn't go into the plot.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad story, it just doesn't hold up to the on-screen visuals, and the BIG REVEAL is telegraphed pretty early on.  The latter half of the movie really didn't hold much surprise.  That said, it's not like you have to park your brain at the door, the story works and the plot holds even though it's predictable.  That's why I only knocked off one star -- a little better craftsmanship and the movie would have been a roller coaster instead of a carousel.

2288521,4,B0009ESTDW,"I might as well admit I went to see this because I wanted to see what it felt like to purchase a ticket to oblivion.  The story, as far as I can tell, is one where the hero is either awake, dreaming, dreaming he's awake or dreaming he's dreaming.  Not exactly Total Recall, but if you think they ran Blade Runner through the office copier for Total Recall, Oblivion borrows from everything from Planet of the Apes to Aeon Flux.  One thing these mega movies teach us is that money does not buy originality.

In the end, I think it's the effects and visual design that make Oblivion entertaining.  You know there's trouble when Morgan Freeman has to fill you in on what's up with the story around the 90 minute mark.  Anyhow, my take on the story.  There has been a war.  The earth was victorious but the planet was left uninhabitable except for a little spread that Tom owns, but that comes later.  Since nobody can live on earth, security is handled by a crew of just 2 people; Tom and a gal who looks like Kate Winslet on a crash diet.  They live in a 50's modern glass house on top of a microwave antenna.  The house has a pool that's like a Corningware baking dish, but larger.

One day, Tom falls through the ceiling of the reading room in the New York Public Library.  He looks for books by L. Ron Hubbard, but the place is a mess and all he can find is a book about dying with honor and purpose.  Then, his wife shows up, which creates a little friction at home, so Tom starts staying out late in his spaceship even though things on earth are dangerous after dark.

In the end, Tom discovers the whole setup is a hoax, run by the folks in the big space station overhead.  You can guess the rest but I won't tell you, except to say he goes up to the big space HQ and it's filled with humans who are in cold storage.  In one of Oblivion's few innovations, these folks are stored sitting down which, I'm sorry to say made it look like each was on the toilet.  End of world but with clean restrooms, I guess.  BTW, I forgot to mention Tom also discovers that he is somebody else, somebody else is him and they fight over it.

Whatever Oblivion was about, I liked it for the effects and soundtrack.  So long as you don't get hung up trying to figure out the story, I recommend it.",1369612800,2,2281,4.209677419354839

2288523,3,B0009ESTDW,"Epic, slick, and at times a little lost, OBLIVION is a well meaning scifi flick that takes too many wrong turns telling it's tale.

Part MATRIX, part TOTAL RECALL, director Joseph Kosinski's tale of a future earth destroyed by alien attack (aided in part by their destruction of the moon).  In the very first minute of the film we're told in a voice over that while humanity won the war (by using nukes), the planet is now a barely recognizable radioactive wasteland.  The few people left are essentially mechanics for huge water processing plants meant to help reestablish humanity on the moon Titan.

Tom Cruise's character is plagued by strange dreams of earth before the invasion - an earth he never saw.  These dreams are apparently brought on by the mind wipe he must go through to ensure that if captured by aliens, he can reveal no vital information.  Otherwise he seems content in fixing battle robots meant to destroy the few remaining alien stragglers and having loveless sex with his outpost partner.

So much of this film's strategy is based on a slow reveal of a great secret.  Without getting in to details, it's a form of storytelling I've been been overly fond of - the flashback.  While it basically works (there's no doubt that all's not as it should be, right from the start), I can't help but wonder what might have been if this film was told as a linear narrative.

And that's because Cruise is never really able to emotionally attach to anything or anyone in the movie, despite a mighty effort to do so.  The story is told in such a disjointed way that one spends more time trying to figure out what the mystery is as opposed to really caring what happens to the people in the story.

Now if the script were more witty in it's dialogue or if the music was better, perhaps this style of film making would have worked better.  But the script is as plain a white bread - absolutely bland and perfunctory.  The music is worse - while electronic band M83 (Anthony Gonzalez & Joseph Trapanese) strive for something grand & epic, it comes off a bland version of Daft Punk's TRON: LEGACY score.  That's ironic as Kosinski also directed that otherwise very bland film.  OBLIVION absolutely screams out for a classical score like John Barry might have done, or something as far out and passionate as Vangelis, but instead is as generic as you're likely to hear in a major movie.

Put simply, there's very little heart or soul in this film.  The effects are clean, crisp, and largely excellent, and the acting - while not stellar - is certainly good enough.  As are the sets, costumes and the like.  In the end Kosinski seemed far too occupied with the twists of the road as opposed to why he's on it in the first place.  That coupled with bland lines and music really helps limit what could have been a much more thrilling film.  One other huge negative - there's really only about an hour's worth of story here (at least as Kosinski tells it), yet OBLIVION is over two hours long, and that is the kiss of death for me.

2288524,4,B0009ESTDW,"I was intrigued enough by the preview to go and see this movie despite the starring role of one Tom Crise but you can't have everything.

Resisting the urge to read the book I went along with an open mind and was wowed by the stunning visuals but doubt began to set in when I saw the world that had been created after the war.  For example, I could not understand where the technology had come from to suck up all of the oceans!

I also noted the similarities between the drones and the Toclafane from Doctor Who several seasons ago when the redoubtable David Tennant was safeguarding the role and later the similarities with the fighters around the Death Star in Star Wars Episode 4.

There were other discontinuities too such as when the captured Cruise gets shot but seemingly gets over it without treatment.

Shades of V and Independence Day crossed my mind too towards the end.

Another discontinuity occurs when jack fights Jack, leaves the second tied up in the middle of a desert without transport, and yet who returns as if he was the first.

Not the best conclusion to the tale, I'd even go so far as to say it was LAME.

You can't have everything.

Worth a viewing?  Yes?

Stand the test of time or closer scrutiny?

Nope.

2288526,3,B0009ESTDW,"It's based on a comic. In this case, that's a bug, not a feature. The silliness of the plot shows this.

It's interesting to start with. The moon has been destroyed by Scavengers, who forced humanity to nuke the earth to bits. Some humans are left on earth to guard the conversion of seawater into energy to enable migration to Titan. Scavs attack these installations from time to time.

Or so we are told.

Now, this crucial operation is left to a scattering of humans with extremely limited defense resources - and throughout the movie you ask yourself, why? Doesn't make sense, even when you find out what's really going on.

You already guessed the true nature of the Scavs. The mystery of what really happened is also compelling. But the story - even its big twist - unfolds sloooooowwwwwly. There are scenes which should have been edited out for time. In one egregious example, a proposal scene is described ... THEN THEY SHOW IT TO YOU just in case you missed it. Things just take too long to happen. But the worst is yet to come.

The ending is, basically, (SPOILER ALERT) ... Independence Day, only infinitely stupider. Yes,that's right. The aliens who destroyed THE MOON are too clueless to stop one man with a nuke ... An advanced, predatory alien species with the capabilities of interstellar travel and moon-rending allows an already suspect quisling of a defeated race into their inner sanctum with nary a TSA patdown ... Why not just trot the writer onto the screen and pie-face him for not having any believable ideas on how to end it all?. (SPOILER ENDS)

It's a shame. Morgan Freeman looks a goof in his round shades. The first plan to nuke the alien ship doesn't make sense (why escort the bomb out? Don't you just program and release it?). And with their resources, surely the aliens could have come up with a better defense plan involving, oh, I don't know, lots of armed, automated machines?

Great CGI, great landscapes of catastrophic devastation, some nice futuristic home design. But ultimately idiotic.

Update: Stupidity abounds. Searching for a downed probe is better done on a motorbike instead of a cool copter? Why? Recovery and repairs are routinely done with woefully inadequate defenses. Why? And on it goes.

Speaking of the end, an earth with no moon is basically unfit for life due to many, many parameters, but let's not even go there.

I liked their pug-faced, endearing killer drone design, the copter and their nice house, but that doesn't tip the scales enough.",1368662400,7,2504,4.762124711316397
2288527,4,B0009ESTDW,"Earth has suffered a cataclysmic alien attack. In an effort to save the human race and the planet, we fight back. Nuclear weapons are deployed. We fight valiently but it is not enough. The population is decimated. Cities are destroyed. The Earth is in ruin, virtually uninhabitable. The survivors are left with no other choice but to flee the dying planet and make a new home on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.

Now imagine that you are one of the only people left on Earth, tasked with protecting and syphoning what few resources remain so that your people can survive. This is Jack Harper's (Tom Cruise) job. He and his partner, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are tasked with drone maintanence --- drones that are critical for protecting their harvest operations. These drones are the last line of defense from hostile ""Skav"" attacks. The pair's mission commander, Sally (Melissa Leo), provides support from the space colony above. In a few short weeks, the harvesters will have collected enough of the remaining raw material needed to ensure humanity's long-term survival and Jack and Victoria can then return to be with their people. Only, after a drone repair goes horribly wrong, Jack is left questioning the motives behind his mission and the supposed dangers posed by the Skavs. And he quickly learns, things on the surface are not what they seem.

when I saw the trailer for Oblivion coupled with the knowledge that Joseph Kosinski (of Tron: Legacy fame) was attached to direct, I was super excited. So I may not be the biggest Tom Cruise fan or anything but with an all-star cast consisting of Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (aka Jamie Lannister from FREAKING Game of Thones!!!), there was no way this movie wasn't going to be a sure-fire winner. To sum up, Oblivion has everything you want/expect out of the genre: killer SFX, action aplenty, pivotal plot-twists and aliens (of course); but it also delivers more than what you initially anticipated. You go into it expecting spaceships and lasers and invasions but you come out having seen so much more.

I will utter a word of caution, however, to those of you who expect to watch your a-typical sci-fi thriller: you will probably walk away from Oblivion feeling slightly underwhelmed because the movie takes its time while unraveling its mysteries. It doesn't just jump straight into the action like many others do these days. But if you love a good storyline, I think you'll be thoroughly pleased with what you see. I have to give Kosinski credit for doing the impossible --- he finds that all-important balance between showing riveting action on screen and telling a captivating story, especially in a genre where excessiveness reigns supreme. This isn't just another alien invasion story. There's some good stuff here. And while even the most adamant of sci-fi fans might preemptively anticipate several of said plot twists, it never detracts from the intended impact.

But as much as I hail this movie for its amazingness, it's not without its flaws either. There was one big thing that forced me to knock my glowing review down from a 5-star to a 4-star rating. Oblivion isn't just a sci-fi film, oh no. It's a stupid love story! When you expect aliens, instead you get a googly-eyed, sap-filled romance. In fact, a good chunk of the film is dedicated to this unanticipated plotline and it made me absolutely crazy! It's kinda similar to what I felt for the movie Titanic. If you take out the love stuff, the movie would've been so much better! Look, I know what you're thinking. It's not that I'm anti-love, I'm just not a fan of love where it doesn't belong ---- like on sinking ships and in goddamn alien invasions! Get with the program people! When it comes to, I dunno, my survival or getting in my kicks one last time, you bet I'm gonna go with the former.

So, yeah. The love stuff. Not a big fan. And that brings me to Olga Kurylenko. Where I felt like Riseborough owned her performance (even the romantic parts), Kurylenko's character only serves to move the love story forward. And while she's not terrible, she's not exactly pivotal either --- more like, just another pretty face. Her character, while it does add some momentum to the spacey stuff, doesn't really inspire. The big surprise for me was Tom Cruise. As I said before, I'm not exactly Tom's biggest fan. For me, he plays much the same character in every movie he's in --- the more-than-meets-the-eye-bad-ass on a mission who ends up questioning authority. That's essentially the case here, only there's more of a softness behind his performance than I've seen in recent years. And where Cruise can sometimes seem a bit alien in real life, he's shockingly human in Oblivion. He proabaly won't win any awards for this performance but you do have to appreciate those subtle nuances that cause you to sympathize with his character's plight. Another suprise for me was how little screen time Melissa Leo and Morgan Freeman are given. Their roles albeit miniscule, do serve a larger, more all-encompassing purpose though. They each serve as a meaningful addition and do shine with whatever time they're alloted. I won't say much for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's character other than HUBBA-HUBBA!

Another amazingly effective role in the film was actually played by the drones. They are surprisingly animated, each reflecting distinctive and very quirky personalities. They kind of reminded me of WALL-E, in a more deadly shoot-em-up, kind of way. They served to highlight the terrifying nature of Earth's precarious situation and to bring the comedy needed to lighten the mood. And to this I tip my hat to the SFX guru's behind-the-scenes. Much of the drones' character was emphasized by the incredible realness of the barren landscape and the stark modernness of their technology. It also doesn't hurt that I saw the movie in IMAX so much more attention to detail is paid visually as well as audibly. I'd say that I had some fairly high expectations for this film, most of which were met. Oblivion is wrought with surprises mostly good, some bad, but overall, I was pretty blown away by its depth and the post-apocalyptic journey on which we went.

Food for Thought: Oblivion is a surprisingly contemplative film with genre-defying cinematography. For a flawed film, strong performances, unexpected plot twists and appropriately timed action make it a must-see. And despite complaints that I might have, both fans and non-fans of the genre can find something to enjoy whether it be the sci-fi journey or the romance that drives it making this movie a sure bet for all!",1368489600,120,6620,4.9053571428571425
2288528,1,B0009ESTDW,"I am not going to avoid spoilers.  This movie has some very basic flaws.  No. 1 is that the advertising presents this movie as a thriller when in truth it is more about a BADLY written romance.  Second, we have yet another extremely advanced alien species who are able to blow up the moon, create fully automated flying battle droids, track a specific human through the desert from a distance at high speed by his DNA, mass clone humans and travel interstellar space, and yet they can't run an effective check point, a check point that fails to identify a 6'2"" 220 lbs 70 year old black man is not a 5'6"" 100 lbs 27 year old woman OR that that man is carrying a major explosive.  If you can't see the re-hashed Independence Day story yet, get this:  This advanced alien race has also missed the importance of a decentralized structure so that one bomb carried to one poorly protected central point kills all the bad aliens.  AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST PART . . .

The worst part is the romance story:  Woman loves man; they go into space; encounter evil aliens; aliens leave woman in hibernation but clone the man about 10 billion times and use him as their invasion troops.  Then, post invasion aliens set up an elaborate monitoring system using the clones of the male and clones of another female.  Note that this monitoring system is, given the alien technology, is completely unnecessary and inefficient.  In spite of that the aliens go the extra step to create false memories in those clones so each grouping of a male and female clone will believe themselves to be a couple.  The reasons the aliens put in all this extra effort on the theory that that will make the clones function more efficiently (ALL OF WHICH IS DONE SO THE ALIENS CAN TAKE EARTH'S HYDROGEN- WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON ELEMENT IN THE UNIVERSE AND IS READILY AVAILABLE TO CREATURES WITH THE ALIEN'S TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT THE WASTE OF A WAR ON EARTH!!!)

It is never explained how this elaborate clone couple system is more efficient than just letting the drones do everything but that doesn't matter- back to the romance.  Surviving humans come up with a way to revive original love of clone man.  Clone man #42 encounters original woman, falls back in love with her.  WOMAN FALLS IN LOVE WITH CLONE EVEN THOUGH SHE KNOWS HE IS JUST ONE OF 10 BILLION COPIES.  Clone man 42 dies but not before impregnating woman.  Three years pass.  Clone man #75462 (let's say) finds woman with child and, of course, they fall in love again.

So, this entire movie was essentially the story of how one clone is as good as any other.  IT TRULY SUCKED.",1368403200,38,2607,4.539614561027837

I'm just looking for a fun time at the movies so I usually go into a movie like this hoping for some good action and some cool visual effects.

Oblivion does not disappoint when it comes to the great visuals.  Overall, the story was pretty good.  Some of it was predictable and I am usually pretty good at predicting what is going to happen next, but I honestly was pleasantly surprised at a few of the twists in the movie.  I saw it coming, but not in the way that I expected.  With this movie, you get some pretty cool future tech vehicles and weapons and some good action.  Overall, the story was a little confusing at first, but was pretty clearly explained in a few short flashbacks, which doesn't leave you going ""huh?"" at the end of the movie.

In conclusion, Oblivion is one of those movies that I'm glad I saw.  I'm not sure that I need to see it again, so I'm on the fence about buying it.  It is a pretty typical Sci-Fi movie.  If you go in just looking for a decent Sci-Fi flick, you probably won't be disappointed with this one.  It looks great in the theater, so that would probably be your best if you can make it out.

2288539,5,B0009ESTDW,"At this point, I've seen this movie three times (twice in a ""normal"" theater and once in IMAX). That might give you a hint as to where I'm going with this.

First a quick disclaimer: I loved Tron Legacy (also directed by Joseph Kosinksi who directs this film), partially because of nostalgia but more because I absolutely loved two aspects of the film which are present here as well: the beautiful visuals of the production's design and the epic soundtrack from Daft Punk. I wasn't too sure I'd love Oblivion but it looked cool (big Sci-Fi fan) and had a nice bit of mystery about what's really going on in the trailers.

I will keep this spoiler-free as I think the events of the movie and where it goes are part of the fun.

The basic plot summary is Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are part of a team that's left on Earth to help with ""clean-up"" after the Earth was devastated by an alien invasion. The world is barely recognizable and most of the survivors (save for Jack and Victoria) are either on Titan or on the space station orbiting the planet called the Tet. The pair work on watching over the drones that are guarding huge water collectors that are pulling Earth's oceans to take with the remaining humans to Titan. Jack is the technician who flies in a dragonfly-shaped ship running patrols and rescuing downed drones. The drones are there and are being downed by a remaining contingent of the alien invasion that are scattered about the planet. As the commercials said, we won the war but lost the planet. Victoria acts as Jack's controller, using telemetry to help Jack while relaying orders coming from the Tet's mission controller.

The rest you'll have to find out by watching.

The film itself, as I said, was beautiful. Everything from the landscapes to the architecture of the tower the duo reside in are just visually stunning. They filmed much of the outdoor scenes in Iceland with its large expanses of desolate arctic tundra and volcanic soil. The director, Joseph Kosinksi, has a background in architecture and it shows in the designs of the tower and vehicles.

The story is based on a graphic novel that the director had written and was talking about after Tron Legacy's release. Another reason I love the film is tied to my love for William Gibson's novels. I'm a big fan of concise dialog. There isn't a lot of hand-holding here. And while the story makes sense if you're open to it the first time through, watching it a second time helps as you'll realize why a certain character was a bit distant and laughed awkwardly at a specific moment. Ignore people going on about the reality of the environment and such...it's a movie people. I won't go into those sorts of things here (though I'm happy to discuss in the comments where people can't see...just no rants please). Just know that there are a couple of twists on the way to the conclusion that turn things on its head.

The music was composed by M85 with the help of Joseph Trapanese and it's a great electronic ride. I've got the album (off iTunes) and personally I like to remove the ""incidental"" pieces that were obviously specific to a scene (I guess they all are but some are just better off in a movie and not blaring from your speakers). Even so, there are a lot of good pieces (I love Waking Up and a couple others I won't mention since the names could give away something...) and even though I'm not typically a fan of vocals over some of these great pieces, the one track with vocals has been winning me over each time I hear it.

As the director himself put it, he wanted to create an environment that was ""desolate but beautiful"" as a sort of 180 from Tron Legacy where everything was dark but colorful. I think he did a great job. I love the fact that he used giant screens projecting video his crew filmed at the top of Haleakala (volcano) in Maui surrounding the tower set so the clouds you see are real, not CGI. That plus the tower set was lit with the light from those projections so you really feel like they're living in a tower above the clouds.

On the acting front, honestly, don't expect Oscar-winning performances. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying this isn't Schindler's List. Tom Cruise does a great job playing his character but I think it's more because the character fits him than because he's pulling a Daniel Day Lewis and transforming himself. The other characters play their roles well (hello Morgan Freeman) and Game of Thrones fans will get a small treat from a Lannister.

That all said, please ignore the critics' reviews. I read through a bunch and they were all saying the same thing...that the movie wasn't original. That it didn't break new ground in anything and blah blah. It annoys me to no end when I read reviews by these people who do nothing but review movies (nice job!) and somehow expect every movie that comes out needs to be never-before-seen and every performance needs to be some sort of incredible experience that goes into history annals and gets taught at film school. The movie tells a story that's original even if elements are going to be similar to other stories (c'mon, science fiction has been around for generations we've covered most of it). The director does a great job of putting it all together and explaining the parts that need explaining.

Unless you absolutely hate any of the actors (especially Tom Cruise since he's central to much of the story) or aren't really a fan of sci-fi (though I'd argue the science fiction aspects really don't matter beyond being tools to tell a fictional story), this should be an enjoyable watch. If you're unsure, feel free to rent it first because as with all things, there are many opinions and what I like may be what you hate.

If you liked the style of Tron Legacy, are a fan of Tom Cruise in general, like sci-fi, or all of the above, definitely go for this movie. If not, rent it and decide. I think the marketing of the movie might have hurt it a bit (along with those critic reviews) since this is not that much of an action film. It's more thoughtful. Hopefully you'll enjoy it.",1367452800,8,6118,4.572080291970803
2288540,4,B0009ESTDW,"(NOTE for anyone who wants to give a negative review: please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)

First: DO NOT READ Amazon's description of OBLIVION!  It gives away key PLOT SPOILERS.

For my part, I will quite deliberately tell you only a little about the plot, as I think it really is best kept as a surprise. Thankfully, the commercials do not do it an injustice, and will not spoil your viewing.

The merest details of the story are as follows: Jack Harper (Cruise) is a repairman known as Tech 49 whose assignment is providing security in order to keep Hydrorig machinery running on what's left of our planet after a ravaging horde of aliens destroyed almost our entire race six decades ago.  Alien scavengers are sabotaging the rigs on a daily basis, and all Jack and his partner are hoping for is to finish their job and join the remainder of Earth's survivors on Titan, a moon of Saturn.

As for anything else, it's best you keep your mind clear until you see the movie.

The acting is very competent and while not entirely engaging, it doesn't have to be: the movie aims for a deliberate aloofness here. And, though the movie has Cruise in almost every shot it is not a typical star turn for him.  For once Cruise has selected a movie that features him but is not ABOUT him, in a sense...it's about what secret lies behind their strange day-to-day existences.

Olga Kurylenko (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace/dp/B001VIMCW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace</a>) and Andrea Riseborough (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brighton-Rock/dp/B005V3HM7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brighton Rock</a>) are excellent, as is Melissa Leo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight/dp/B00BB8RKH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Olympus-Has-Fallen/dp/B00BEIYHO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Olympus Has Fallen</a>).  While Morgan Freeman is featured prominently in the ads, he does not play a large role in the film...though it is pivotal.

OBLIVION is an interesting mix...lots of action, yet it tries to be a thinker. As such, it does provide a puzzle that needs to be put together by the viewer. The real, ultimate problem is that once that's accomplished there isn't a lot there to ponder afterward.  There's a twist, yes; it just isn't all that intellectual. Think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Of-The-Apes-1968/dp/B0053EZWZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Of The Apes (1968)</a>&nbsp;without the BIG shock.

What OBLIVION does really well is look good. It superimposes post-apocalytic scenes of desecrated New York landmarks upon a desolate landscape laid waste by enemy invaders. Shot in Iceland during their 24-hour cycles of daylight, the juxtaposition makes for a stark composition of collapse and ruination...an earth no longer even worth inhabiting.

As always, the desolation is New York City's: the Manhattan (or is it Brooklyn?) Bridge juts out of the silt, in the midst of a rocky crag there is an entrance to a big interior room of the New York Public Library, the Empire State Building appears only from the observation tower on up, and a big football stadium (is it the Met Life Stadium?) lies in ruins.

What director Joseph Kosinski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tron-Legacy/dp/B004R63MWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tron: Legacy</a>) and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Of-Pi/dp/B00BSBT8M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Of Pi</a>) accomplish is to produce the devastation of Earth through the browns, blacks, and greys of the soil and rocks, counterpointed by the bright blueness of the ever-present sky. There is a gorgeous iridescent blue and black night swimming scene in Jack's sky suite, wherein the two actors swim tastefully naked inside a transparent pool. Indeed, Cruise's silver-blue uniform and his clear glass bubble-like helicopter are sleek and artistically interposed in this world of greys, blues and browns. When they travel into space, it is primarily dark and black. When he is trapped within the hidden caverns of his enemy it is a dark, shadowy world of blacks, greys, and browns.

There is only one place in this whole movie that really displays color, and it is a hideaway Jack  has created for himself in what one can only assume is New York's Adirondacks -- though these scenes were shot in California. It's a little hamlet of lush greenery that has within it a cabin of artifacts Jack's lifted upon his trips around the ruins of NYC. He has tucked away books, Procul Harum and Led Zeppelin albums, a doll, and photos near and dear to him. The audience at my showing had a little chuckle at the fact that he places on one shelf his own iconic sunglasses...to my way of thinking, the trademark of one Mr. ""Top Gun"" Cruise.

So the film is strikingly visual, and a beauty to see at the theater. I saw it in an IMAX theater (though it was not shot that way) and it was gorgeous. Besides that, the soundtrack by French band M83 is also alternately pensive and rousing, peacefully employing a lone piano one moment, then next dishing up an insistent orchestral piece.

All in all, OBLIVION is a beautiful, striking, thoughtful work, though it doesn't -- as perennial one-year old genius Stewie Griffin might say -- ""leave us richer for the experience.""",1367452800,3,5589,5.712048192771085

2288542,5,B0009ESTDW,"I liked this film. It is not an immortal master-piece, but it is well made. Below, some more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.

Year of Grace 2079. After a devastating war against alien invaders, Moon was broken in pieces and Earth was left a barren, poisoned desolation. The aliens were in principle defeated but what was left of humanity had to move to Titan, which is now being slowly terraformed. The ruined Earth was abandoned to two categories of inhabitants - the Scavs, a handful of alien survivors, stranded castaways barely managing to survive miserably one day at a time and the two lonely humans, Victoria (Andrew Riseborough) and Jack (Tom Cruise) who supervise the last stage of evacuation of the planet, which includes pumping and carrying away what remains of uncontaminated water on Earth by robotic installations and automated cargo ships.

Jack does the most dangerous job by flying daily repair and maintenance missions, mostly fixing combat drones, which protect the installations from the desperate and aggressive Scavs. From their flying house, a safe refuge out of reach of Scavs, Victoria watches over him, warns him of dangers and if necessary musters drones to help him. It is a harsh and quite sad life, but they have one another for comfort - and also their task will soon be over.

But Jack is not well. He doesn't sleep well since some time and every morning wakes up more and more tired, exhausted by strange dreams which repeat themselves - dreams in which he meets a strange Woman (Olga Kurylenko), a woman he can not remember ever knowing, but who nevertheless seems surprisingly familiar... And then, one day after he wakes up for another day of work on the surface, the film really begins...

This is a good film, although it borrows heavily from many of older and better Sci-Fi movies (I will not name them, to avoid spoilers - but you will recognise them). Although Philip K. Dick didn't have anything to do with the scenario, he would probably recognise his influence in it - and I think he would have liked this film, for quite a lot of reasons... There is a good mixture of slow scenes setting the mood and of action. There is a mystery in this film, and the FULL disclosure is not given until almost the end - and it is done very, very well indeed. And the ending, always the most vulnerable spot for all Sci-Fi super-productions, is well done - and it is both moving and in the same time asking questions, on which we have to think a little before answering...

Tom Cruise, who notwithstanding some excentricities, is a great actor, gives here a GREAT performance, both when talking and when shooting. Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman (who appears late in the film in a way which you will have to discover by yourself) are also very good. But personally, I was MOST impressed by the character of Victoria and the way Andrea Riseborough played her. It is not an easy role and it is definitely not easy to outstage a looker like Olga Kurylenko - but in my personal opinion Ms Riseborough totally did it!

Another personal favorite in this film are combat drones - they are really cool, both in their visual aspect (shape and especially this SPEED!) and in the sounds they produce. Those are really some bad@ss military robots, infinitely more dangerous and cooler than most of such things in recent Sci-Fi. And just to be clear - do not expect any cute Transformers-like machines... Those things were made to fly far, find quickly and terminate with extreme prejudice, not to sell action-figures...)))

There are of course plot holes - but well, come on, without plot holes all heroes would always die and bad guys would always win. And who would like that?

Bottom line, I liked this film and I am very happy that finally I was given the opportunity to watch a GOOD big budget SciFi film. Try to catch it in the cinema as long as it is still playing - me, I think I will buy the DVD when it is available, because it is worth another watching one day.

2288544,4,B0009ESTDW,"Cruise and crew offer a lot to like in ""Oblivion."" It starts out simply enough - Jack (Cruise's character) and Victoria live quietly enough, handling repairs of the robots that protect the mining operations. The back-story all makes sense: alien invaders some time back, Earth fought them off, but the population had to leave the ruined planet. A few pockets of invaders remain, the ""scavengers""  who sabotage the robots and mining, but seem little more than nuisances. Jack and Vicca carry on, looking forward to rejoining the rest of humanity at the end of their stint.

But, one by one, the pieces of this story fall apart. The scavengers aren't who Jack was told they are, their controllers aren't who they thought, and even Jack and Vicca aren't who they thought. Each time part of the story falls away, something deeper and darker takes its place, including plot elements reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moon/dp/B0030B621W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moon</a>.

Earth has basically been demolished by aliens, and he's living with a women who was posted there with him.

- The movie held my attention throughout, and had that ""edge of your seat"" feel at times.

2288547,4,B0009ESTDW,"""Oblivion"" is a sweeping sci-fi epic that, because it stars Tom Cruise, elevates its deeply personal material to a level of expectations few films can realistically achieve.  With a title like ""Oblivion"" it's challenging to ignore the baggage Cruise brings to the role.  The film seems to ask: What does it take to obliterate Tom Cruise?

The setting is, like ""Star Wars,"" entirely subservient to the characters - nothing happens in the world that isn't connected to the relationships on screen, which means there's little back story provided if it doesn't serve the plot. But whereas ""Star Wars"" could stretch some logical elements with it's sci-fi/fantasy setting, ""Oblivion"" has all the trappings of hard sci-fi, which invites stronger scrutiny.  Unfortunately the setting doesn't hold up under closer examination.

The year is 2077, and Cruise plays yet another Jack, Jack Harper, Tech 49.  He and his lover and coworker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are the only two humans left on Tower 49 in what used to be New York City on what used to be Earth, destroyed 60 years before in a war with the alien Scavs.  With Victoria at the Tower and Jack in the field, they work to repair the spherical drones, ED209-inspired robots that move lightning fast and are armed to the teeth.  The drones keep the Hydrorigs safe, giant upside down pyramids that suck up the ocean and eventually send the water to the mother ship called the Tet.  Victoria looks forward to finishing their mission in two weeks and returning to the relocated home of humanity on Titan. Jack isn't so sure, and as his back story is revealed it turns out he's a lot more like Cruise himself.

But as the trailers blatantly give away, the Scavs aren't whom they appear to be.  Most incongruous is the fact that Jack and Victoria have their minds wiped ""for security reasons."" Being in the New York sector triggers memories for Jack, and he is haunted by dreams of Julia (Olga Kurylenko) whom he met at the Empire State Building.  When he finds out Julia's real, everything changes.

""Oblivion"" drips with symbolism.  It's easy to get wrapped up in the highly stylized visuals of the drones, or the dragonfly like ship Jack flies, or the perpetual dawn that suffuses every frame. But the crux of the story revolves around the Tet - a relationship between three points. The Tet is a physical object - a tetrahedron or four-sided die as gamers know it - and that design is also part of the Hydrorigs.  Point upward the tetrahedron is a pyramid that inspires, builds and ascends.  Facing downwards, it's threatening, ominous, dagger-like.  Visually, we know something is wrong with the Tet just by its appearance.

There's more symbolic Tets too.  The delicate balance between Jack - distant, distracted, pining for former Earth - and Julia - clingy, needy, her eyes perpetually dilated in adoration of her man - is turned into a three-point tetrahedron with the arrival of Julia, who has a much more substantial connection to Jack. The Tet becomes a wedge between them, driving them apart with the past even as it connects them together by a shared tragedy in the present.

The Tet is also short for ""teth,"" the ninth letter in gematria that spells the name of God in the Tetragrammaton. It is the building block of man's comprehension of the divine, and Jack's relationship with the rest of humanity and the alien invaders pivots on unmasking false gods.

This is not a film that will advance women's rights.  Every female character is subservient to Jack, and he is undoubtedly the top of the tetrahedron.  But both women act as his foundation (if only in a deeply-gendered role of lover) and when they are removed he falls with them.

""Oblivion"" has enough twists to play with viewers' expectations, but each twist begs more questions with few answers.  This doesn't necessarily detract from the enjoyment of the film's central tenets, but it can distract anyone expecting sci-fi world-building instead of a three-act play.

Despite Cruise' involvement, the film is a thought-provoking if occasionally frustrating tale about what it means to obliterate oneself. What does it take to obliterate a towering presence like Cruise? ""Oblivion's"" answer is more of him.",1367280000,,4227,4.901685393258427

In thought this was a fairly original idea..Except for the part when Cruise flies up the bomb to the big ship..It felt like I was watching Will Smith In ""Independence Day"".  This is a clever movie in several ways, but the dialogue could have been greatly improved in some areas.  I also felt uncomfortable in every scene where Morgan Freeman was in..He was out of place and would have much rather watched a no name actor play the part.  It is a fun piece to watch and I am glad I paid a fortune to see it at the theatre.  Cruise looks as good as ever and does some decent acting.",1367193600,,731,4.23021582733813

Enough twists and turns to keep you guessing where the story was going. Left me asking a few questions about some of the inconsistencies (I pay attention to details and how they fit into the story line) but nothing that took away my enjoyment of the film. Definitely came out of it feeling I got a value for my entertainment dollar.,1367193600,,452,4.524390243902439

Even interview with Tom Cruise created a lots of hype about it talking how amazing it was to work with filmmakers. I was very disappointed to find out that the movie is nothing else, but boring. Yes, visual effects are done well, but in 2013 it's just expected.
Story of this movie can be told in 5 minutes. Problem is that its stretched into 2 hours. Script of the movie steals ideas from many others sci-fi movies gluing them together in one confused story. There are also some obvious logical holes and not even Morgan Freeman appearance (for about 5 minutes total) could save this movie. Story moves very slowly without any twists. This movie is just bad.",1367193600,18,723,4.526717557251908

2288552,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is undoubtedly a ""homage"" film.  This doesn't necessarily have to be considered a bad thing.  While it certainly is lacking in the originality department, it more than makes up for that with the enthusiasm it has for the movies it borrows from - specifically, late `60's and `70's sci-fi.  After the cheesiness and saccharine of the `50's, sci-fi took a side path into journeys of discovery and pondered the mysteries of the universe.  Film's of the time - notably 2001: A Space Odyssey - were less about action or horror and more about capturing the public emotion present in the years after the first man landed on the moon.

Oblivion captures that spirit perfectly.  Considering it takes place on the ruined planet Earth, this is no mean feat.  That the film doesn't focus on the wreckage of humanity, but the wonder of what's been preserved goes a long way to keeping the focus on the wonder of the universe.  The color pallet is saturated with sunlight, a stark contrast to more dark and grimy post-Alien era of sci-fi films (the recent Prometheus comes to mind).  The architecture is cleanly designed - clearly, Apple Corporation's visual sensibilities will stay with us until 2077. All this serves to create a world that wants to be viewed and explored - not hostile and alien, but familiar and welcoming.

Everyone will identify with Jack Harper, then, when he feels reluctant to leave.  Harper (played by Tom Cruise) is a maintenance tech on the vast structures that siphon water and useful materials from the barren rock that was once the planet.  He and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are only two weeks from being able to pack up and leave to rejoin what remains of humanity on the ""Tet"", a sort of interplanetary ark.  Evidently, although the human race won the battle against whatever alien race menaced it, it left the planet totally unusable.  While Victoria is eagerly awaiting their call to leave, Jack is not so sure, his hesitance prompted by his discovery of a small oasis hidden in a mountain range that he frequently spends the night at against Command's orders.

Amidst Victoria's feeble reassurances to Command that they are both still an ""effective team"", there is sense of something wrong.  Jack has continual flashbacks to a time before the world ended (a time he should not have been alive to see) all involving a mysterious woman.  As sci-fi tropes demand, as Jack is out on a maintenance run, an unidentified ship crash lands near him, and he finds her body in stasis in the wreckage.  Needless to say, not all is as it seems, and Jack's position slowly begins to unravel as he finds out he has been misled.

No, it's not exactly original, but sometimes originality isn't necessary.  Oblivion walks in the path left behind by previous cinema heavyweights, but it does so with a vigor and pace that keeps the audience engaged, even when we see the twist coming miles away.  There are a few weak spots - while Cruise does a good job acting, his lines are often comically stilted.  There's a slight cheese factor here.  More demanding science fiction aficionados will find a great deal of plot holes as well, although many are closed up before the film's end.  Let's just say a lot of things aren't supposed to make sense at first.

Setting that aside, Oblivion is a movie that does its predecessors proud.  With excellent visual effects, competent acting, and appealing callbacks to the golden age of sci-fi, it's enough to make you feel like the summer movie season is already here.",1367107200,3,3532,4.7775947281713345

2288555,4,B0009ESTDW,"This film was way better than I expected going in. It features some of the best visual effects I have seen in a long time, but it doesn't sacrifice character development or a good story in the process. Oblivion feels like a much more complete movie than the director's last effort, Tron: Legacy, which was pretty much just eye candy. The musical score is also a thing of beauty. I need this soundtrack!

I may not like Tom Cruise the person, but he can more than hold his own on screen. Morgan Freeman is always good, even in a tiny role like this. The two female leads are easy on the eyes with Andrea Riseborough turning in a memorable performance as Jack's (Tom Cruise) mission partner/lover and Olga is well...easy on the eyes.

The story does get a little confusing from time to time and some of the twists were a bit obvious (at least to me), but by the end I pretty much had it all figured out. I will surely be adding this one to my blu-ray collection.",1367020800,2,960,4.3277777777777775

2288557,4,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a story about Jack Harper (played by Cruise) serving as a security repairmen stationed on an evacuated Earth. Part of a massive operation to extract vital resources after decades of war with a terrifying alien threat who still scavenges what's left of our planet, Jack's mission is almost complete. In a matter of two weeks, he will join the remaining survivors on a lunar colony far from the war-torn world he has long called home. Jack's existence is brought crashing down after he rescues a beautiful stranger from a downed spacecraft.

Watching this in the theaters, I was amazed by the stunning and beautiful special effects. This movie makes the destroyed earth look strikingly realistic. The special effects are definitely the highlight of the movie.

Cruise brings a solid acting effort along with Freeman although his (Freeman's) role is relatively short as over half the movie is over when he makes his first appearance.

The movie starts a little slowly and takes a bit too long to give the background of Harper's job and relationship with his ""wife"" but once the movie gets rolling into the story it is entertaining until the end. This along with a few plot holes, which I won't give away here, keeps this from being a five star review. The plot is an interesting one but there are a few things that you will have to not think about while you watch or the plot will fall apart a bit.

2288558,4,B0009ESTDW,"OBLIVION is a gorgeous movie to look at.  It's a marvel of brown and gray.  Tom Cruise is a charismatic movie star.  Those two elements alone make the film worth seeing.  And it's a good thing OBLIVION has those things going for it, because much of the rest is so-so at best.

I appreciated the steady , slow-paced build of this film...it is not very action heavy, short of one extended (and disjointed) shootout in an underground bunker facility.  We really mostly spend A LOT of time in closeup with Tom Cruise, with a gorgeously ravaged earth all around him.

We meet Cruise as he's setting out on another ""drone repair"" mission to earth...and earth that was essentially obliterated during a war with alien invaders.  We won the war, but had to abandon the ruined planet.  Cruise and his partner/lover (Andrea Riseborough) are all alone on a station build well above the surface of the planet.  Below, the cities and farmlands are all covered in dunes.  The top of the Empire State Building is all that pokes through the surface...most of the rest of NYC is buried.  Offshore, gigantic machines, serviced by drones, are pulling up the water from our oceans and are used up in a fusion process to bring energy to Saturn's moon, Titan...where the remnants of humanity have fled.

Riseborough (an actress I don't know well, but who makes for an interesting, striking figure) stays on the station, while Cruise yearns to spend more and more time on earth.  He has no memories of the planet, but he has an infinite interest in what life was like there.  His passion for his work and for the planet are what draw us to his character.  Cruise is seldom a truly great actor.  But he's one of those stars (like Clooney) who are charismatic and engaging.  Cruise is usually helped by having a character with a dark side or a past...and we get hints of both.  He carries himself with both great physical assurance AND air of sadness.

And the earth around him, bleak and nearly empty, is a CGI wonder.  I know that almost all of it is completely ""fake"" but the special effects teams have done a stellar job in creating a convincing, post-apocalyptic world that is lovely to look at.  I enjoyed the many scenes where Cruise flies around.  I'm so tired of bloated CGI worlds, be they Middle Earth or Thor's home planet or any other gilded, over-stuffed fantasy world.  OBLIVION feels ""tasteful.""  The color palette, from Riseborough's clothing to the hue of the sand dunes, is soothing and creative.

Needless to say, the movie is not just about Cruise flying around earth.  Slowly and surely, the reality he thought he knew begins to come under assault, both from external factors and from bits of memory that come back to him.  I won't say more, because the movie wants you to slowly unravel its mysteries.  I won't spoil them, although I think they are not terribly inventive in the long run.  Eventually, other characters are introduced, and they are not well fleshed out, even for a sci-fi story.  Olga Kurylenko appears and I left to wonder again (as I did for QUANTUM OF SOLACE and HIT MAN) how she gets large movie roles.  She is bland and uninteresting.  Morgan Freeman is on hand, but does little more than talk like Freeman...it's barely a performance.

I'll say again, it's a good thing the experienced and engaging Cruise is on hand to be our tour guide.  With a less compelling star, the less-original-than-its-creators-think plot and the mostly non-existent character development would doom this film.  As it is, I found enough here to like and to recommend the film.  I give it 3.5 stars, but will round up to 4.",1366934400,,3618,4.667721518987341

I was looking forward to this movie not because of Tom Cruise but because it looked interesting. While this is a very good movie and well worth seeing I had to laugh a few times.

Serioulsy, think of a sci-fi movie and there is something in this one from that. The movie did have a kind of 80's feel to it which was cool and it is worth seeing but it's really just a collage of sci-fi from 2001 to After Earth (yes the movie that hasn't come out yet is even ripped off).

2288561,3,B0009ESTDW,"[...]

The fact 2012 has passed is clearly of no concern to Hollywood.  An incoming assault of end-of-the-world and post-apocalyptic pictures is nigh, with After Earth, Pacific Rim, World War Z and This Is the End keeping Earth in plenty of jeopardy.  The first one up?  Summertime precursor Oblivion.  Set roughly a half-century into the future, the movie serves up as many immaculate shots as it does derivations from previous science fiction works.

Pitching Oblivion's premise doesn't necessarily make it sound like a riveting experience; Tom Cruise leads a small cast of relatively small players (aside from one Morgan Freeman) as Jack Harper.  His task is to repair drones which have been taken down and left by beings known as Scavs.  Truth be told, it takes a while to reach the movie's meat, and even longer to find its funky bones.  Before and in-between those points are a few stretches that could've easily been tightened for a bit less seat-shifting.  Twists and turns, especially of the unpredictable kind, are seldom and infrequent.

One thing Oblivion does accomplish  well is a certain level of intrigue, namely after the first hour.  A certain twist happens that, if unsurprising, still opens up a few questions the movie assumes we've already pondered.  As the final act starts to close, a sense of eminence comes forward which, if nothing else, holds our undivided attention.  Concern arises not so much with the convenient ending, but the payoff stemming from the climax.  Backing details are both sparse and vague, further reinforced by a brief but jarring shift in setting.

Looking past the story isn't too difficult, since there are several spectacular sights to behold.  If you've ever wondered what Earth would look like after every single disaster movie, Oblivion is here to fill (or show) the gaps.  Since many of these come during the first act, it means the feathery stakes can rest easy for a short while.  Even when the eye candy changes to slightly more action-packed moments, we still get to enjoy concise directing.  You won't feel the raised stakes so much as witness them, but at least the ongoings are discernible.

As our key tour guide, Tom Cruise delivers another solid performance.  Most of the time, the entire movie falls on his shoulders.  Thankfully, he's versed and competent enough to handle this without stumbling or overreaching.  And since this is Mr. Cruise, it just wouldn't look right for him to not have at least one attractive lady beside him.  In the case of Andrea Riseborough, we have a better take on what would normally be a simple caricature.  Some of her emoting feels unnatural, but the unease her character goes through is pleasantly convincing.  This is more than what can be said for Olga Kurylenko who, though not bad, doesn't have enough material to work with.  Most of her scenes seem forced in.  As for Morgan Freeman, who comes in rather late, he really doesn't have to act to convince the average audience member.  That said, he works out just a bit more than the character would if portrayed by anyone else.

Other than the visual quality, what will probably stand out to film enthusiasts is just how much Oblivion borrows from other sci-fi movies.  2001: A Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Independence Day and even Armageddon merely lead an all-too-obvious list.  Thankfully, while Oblivion can't stand half as high as some, it does exceed the lesser works.

While the true juggernauts of 2013 still haven't been released, Oblivion isn't necessarily a minuscule player.  Those who have yet to verse themselves with most fundamental sci-fi films might walk away feeling floored.  Other, more acquainted viewers will want to see this as a homage to its forefathers, which is touched upon at certain points.  Keep your expectations modest and the end results might be enough for you to afford it a recommendation.",1366848000,7,3881,4.95046439628483
2288562,5,B0009ESTDW,"When I first saw a trailer for Oblivion, I felt like it was custom made for me. Then, last night, while watching it in IMAX,they started playing a Led Zeppelin song in the movie, I knew it was made for me. Oblivion was a mix of the greatest Sci-Fi already made and yet it was still unique in its own way. Other reviewers have said that the writing is better in the first half and that the movie becomes predictable or not as strong in the second half. I completely disagree. I felt like the script, while borrowing bits from other Sci-Fi, remained engaging and well-done through out the whole movie. If you see this movie in IMAX, in addition to being blown away by the incredible surround sound, you will actually see more of the picture than in a traditional theater. They opened it up for most of the movie. There were a few parts (only one I noticed was around the beginning) where it was the more narrow widescreen picture. For the rest of the time it filled up the huge IMAX screen. The special effects, details, set design, sound design, music, and acting were all top notch in Oblivion (well, Olga was about as good as you can expect from her). The best part about this movie was that my wife liked it. She said it didn't stress her out too much. She also loved the way the music went with the movie. She thought the surround sound and sound effects were some of the best she's heard in a long time. She said she wants to see it again just for the sound. I highly recommend this movie. I liked how by the end, all loose ends are tied up and everything makes sense. This movie does give you the opportunity to think deeper on the meaning, or you can just take what they give you and be totally fine. Go see it in IMAX. I wonder when Tom Cruise will start looking his age...? A note on the CONTENT of the PG-13 rating: Sci-Fi violence on a Star Wars level of graphic-ness. Language that is Low to Middle of the road for PG-13. There is 1 ""F"" word, as is normal for PG-13 now-a-days, and a few ""S"" words and ""SOBs."" Religious exclamations were very minimal, like two I think. There is a pool scene where you see a dark silhouette of rear female nudity then you can see it through the water for a short time also. In another scene, we see a bare female back from the waist up. Thanks for reading, now go watch this in IMAX. Go in with an open mind and be ready to have fun!
BLU-RAY UPDATE: I'll keep this brief. The picture and sound are PERFECT. The only downside is that the blu-ray does NOT include the IMAX aspect ratio change, it stays in 2.39:1 the whole time. The special features are actually really satisfying. And it doesn't take that long to get through them. If you want to see how any aspect of this movie was made, you will see in the making-of portion. If you are like my wife, and feel that the behind the scenes stuff ruins movies, then don't watch this part, because it definitely uncovers the magic behind key scenes. The Audio commentary with the Director and Tom Cruise was extremely interesting and entertaining. The musical score isolated audio track was actually really engaging and showed off the beautiful score. The deleted scenes added a bit of depth. Overall, it is a fantastic blu-ray of an awesome movie. This movie holds up to repeat viewings because you'll notice new stuff each time. Enjoy!",1366848000,279,3328,4.360708534621578
2288563,4,B0009ESTDW,"No Spoilers here. So relax. The films Total Recall and the Matrix had a baby, and it's name was Oblivion. I really enjoyed the action, sleek visuals and mind-bending concepts introduced in this film. Can I wish for a better developed version of Morgan Freeman's character? Might it have been better if we had  split this epic into two or three films? I wish they had made a graphic novel first, to work out the plot problems, before taking this to film. There's no reason why this film could not have been this generation's Star Wars, but it fell markedly short.
It felt like they had trouble squeezing so much ponderous material into the standard less than 2 hour format. And yet it is the mere existence of such ponderous material that I found so refreshing.
Worts and all, I loved this film, partly out of a nostalgia for a time when science fiction was for grown-ups; and a time when it was okay to trust that your audience is intelligent enough to appreciate deeper themes and subtexts. We, the science-believing,

2288565,3,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion (2013) - Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau

Premise: After an alien invasion, the Earth has been left a nuclear wasteland. Survivors gather aboard the TET in preparation to leave to a new colony on Titan. Before they can make the journey, resources such as water need to be harvested if there's to be any chance for survival: Enter Jack Harper, Tech 49 (Tom Cruise), who with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) protect drones designed to find and kill ""Scavs"" - the remnant alien survivors of the invasions who carry out attacks on the resource gatherers. When a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) crash lands on the planet though, everything Jack thought he knew is called into question...

Thoughts: High definition brought out the best in this visually arresting film. The musical score (by M83) is intense, awesome but, at times, a bit overpowering/jarring in certain sequences. The acting is very well done, but unfortunately the film's script and story lacks the calibre of its talent. The story meanders, there are nonsensical plot twists which are not explored for anything but shock value. As a result, at times the film can be quite frustrating. Additionally, not all the characters are developed well - specifically Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's supporting character who - though bad ass - doesn't get developed beyond ""bad ass with long hair and a gun."" But each actor does their best to bring something to the table and it shows - though it isn't enough to cover the plot holes and lack of development at times.

Should you buy this film: My experience was watching the film in true IMAX. As such, the visuals were incredible - if you have a High Def television and a surround sound system, then I definitely recommend this film on bluray. Anything less, you're being robbed. At the same time: this film is NOT on the same level as a smaller indie film which covers a lot of the same ground in different ways. If you're looking for quality science fiction, I recommend Duncan Jones' Moon starring Sam Rockwell. However, if you're looking for a beautifully shot action adventure film with a great soundtrack, Oblivion would probably be a good call.",1366761600,100,2237,4.96

2288567,3,B0009ESTDW,"Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) chose to take a very operatic approach to this story which is based on a comic book written by Kosinski and Arvid Neslon and a screenplay adapted again by Kosinski, Karl Gajdusek (Tresspass, Dead Like Me) and Michael Arndt ( Toy Story 3, Star Wars VII).

The look and feel of the film is smooth and clean while the drama flows in the same direction and slowly, very slowly unfolds to reveal the truth about the people on Earth and a catastrophic event left earth just barely alive. The moon was destroyed, although we don't know how, and that was the beginning of the end for Earth.

Tom Cruise (Top Gun, Jack Reacher) plays an astronaut Jack who is assigned to repair and maintenance of drones that protect a machine that basically turns our seawater into energy for a the population of earth which has `apparently' moved to a moon of Saturn after an alien attack. It was an alien war in which Earth apparently won or so the audience is lead to believe.

Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Dolphin Tale) plays an unsuspecting prospector of many who holds the truth of what really happened. His command of the scenes he is in makes you believe what he says, although unbelievable at first, it could be true. I can't give away the reasons or what he represents without spoiling the film for you, but - spoiler - everything is not what it seems to be.

Two really good, sedate but powerful performances come from Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace, Hitman) as a mission specialist with a history with Cruise's character that will defiantely surprise you - and the second performance comes from Andrea Riseborough (Shadow Dancer, Resistance) playing the woman in Cruise's life who along with maintaining the technical aspects of communication is also his partner in life.

The ships, probes, drones, vehicles and even the finale with the surprise orbiting station is visually impressive. The action sequences are intense and by the second hour it seems like a nonstop action/adventure film filled near misses and explosions.

""Oblivion"" has an interesting and dynamic musical score to accompany the visuals by M.8.3., a pop/rock group with composer Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese that really captures the `feel' of what is going on. The movie really begins to take flight really in the second half of the film but it does have the widescreen epic motif that allows the audience to ask questions and just about almost all of them are answered. Others are not. Overall it's a good film, but not something that will have a long standing in the theatres. I am sure it will work better on Blu Ray, because it is a little long-winded, but the visuals are stunning at times.",1366675200,3,2711,4.782051282051282
2288568,4,B0009ESTDW,"""Oblivion"" is a true science fiction story. I say that because a true science fiction story has technology, gadgets and a futuristic view of the world. Of course in ""Oblivion"" the future of earth is destined for nuclear catastrophe and that theme has been done so many times in movies, it must be true. There are new kinds of drones that are not small planes that drop bombs on targets, but large ""Robocop"" like circular machines with turrets and a programmed mind that annihilates most anything that moves. Finally, we have a spectacularly cool plane that twists and turns and truly must be seen to explain.

The biggest thing standing in the way of ""Oblivion"", in my opinion, is an advertisement that claims that it is the best film of the year. Well, it is only April and the summer blockbuster season and the end of the year Oscar season haven't even arrived yet, but that's a pretty bold statement. So, is it?

I want to say that ""Oblivion"" is one of the most creative science fiction movies I've seen in years, but I'm going to hold off on that because truly, its creativity is a collage of many science fiction movies that came before it. I'm not going to list those movies because I don't want to give anything away, but there are probably six. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a mechanic assigned to a wife who work as a team patrolling an area that wasn't affected by nuclear fallout and repairing downed drones. Harper and all other known survivors have had their memories cleared; yet he continues to have dreams of his past life.

""Oblivion"" has a moody pace to it, occasionally it is eventful and consuming and occasionally it is slow and dramatic. Unlike many movies these days that spend zero time at all building up character and just want to dazzle you with all the really nifty effects they've discovered, ""Oblivion"" does the opposite; it puts character first and then sucks you in with the effects. Maybe a happy medium would have worked better, but I'm not going to complain because I'm tired of movies that make you feel nothing but, ""Wow! That looked cool."" Thankfully, somebody in Hollywood realizes that you need to put heart first when telling a story. If you're tired of emotion-free action/science fiction movies as well, you'll probably love ""Oblivion"".

I have a hard time believing by the end of 2013 that ""Oblivion"" will be the best movie of the year. The elements that make up the story are way too recycled to have too much of an impact down the road. Although for now, the realizations of the technology and the heart that it delivers make it the best movie I've seen so far this year. Thankfully, great actors like Morgan Freeman, Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko and an emotional performance by Andrea Risenborough turned a stale story into something memorable and good.",1366675200,2,2798,4.680894308943089
2288569,3,B0009ESTDW,"I'll admit, I went into Oblivion with more than a few preconceived notions. I don't think I'm alone in seeing Tom Cruise more as a carefully marketed brand than person or even actor. A Cruise movie pretty much guarantees slick special effects and at least moderately effective storytelling. But it also translates to cautious calculation; so while a Cruise movie is less likely to be an absolute bomb, it also pretty much guarantees the film will be devoid of risks or real surprises.

As explained by clunky voiceover narration, Oblivion takes place in 2077. Sixty years earlier an alien race called the Scavengers, or ""Scavs,"" as they are more commonly referred, attacked Earth and blew up the moon. Although the human race won the war, Earth was left inhospitable and mankind has relocated to an orbiting space station until enough of the earth's resources have been harvested to make it to a new home on Saturn's moon, Titan.

Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a maintenance worker and one of the last humans on earth. Oblivion takes its time presenting Cruise's day to day life on a barren futuristic world, and the film seriously benefits from the time. Director Joseph Kosinski presents both the advanced technology and ravaged landscapes with a sparse elegance that conjures a kind of wonder harkening back to the golden age of science fiction.

Of course, it's only a matter of time before Cruise's routine is interrupted by some nasty encounters with the Scavs and the drones he's assigned to maintain. As the plot unfolds, what's most surprising isn't how tired or cliched the twists are, but how inoffensively the movie treads well worn ground. At times it feels like you could play spot the reference: a bit of Philip K. Dick here, a touch of Stanley Kubrick there. But the movie is often so in touch with the spirit of its genre that it feels classically science fiction without ever coming close to being a classic piece of science fiction. It's only in the film's third act that things really start to come unraveled with confusing leaps in the plot's logic and paint by numbers action sequences.

But the film's biggest problem is the acting. For a movie whose crux is the concept of humanity, Oblivion is very light on emotion. Cruise's Jack Harper spends most of the movie teetering between stoic hero and vapid cardboard cutout, preferring to outright state his feeling rather than express them. In dealing with heavy concepts like identity and memory, Oblivion seems poised in its early scenes to enter the heady, often anxious thematic universe of Philip K. Dick and Andre Tarkovskiy. But Cruise's character seems relatively immune to the weight of each plot turn, and the film itself either misses or doesn't care to chase the implications of Cruise's love interests.

Despite its problems, Oblivion is thoroughly entertaining and always pleasing to the eye. It's a good movie to ease into the summer season with: giving its audience what they came for, but nothing more.",1366588800,14,2990,4.901185770750988
2288570,4,B0009ESTDW,"Michael Phillips, movie reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, didn't much care for this film. That I respect his work a lot put me in a position. Do I see it on the big screen or wait for the DVD release? I forked over me money at the cinema and I'm glad I did.

Here's the scoop. Earth was attacked by some aliens. We won the war but killed the planet in the process. Earth folk have migrated to Titan and Jack, (Tom Cruise) and his controller cum sidekick Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are left behind to maintain the flying drones that guard the massive Hydrogen converters against attack by the scavengers, those who chose not to go to Titan. Jack also has a recurring dream of a particular woman who he somehow thinks he might know. Jack gets caught by the scavengers and he finds out the world might not be set up quite the way he was told.

OK. OK. Yes there are some things that were borrowed. And some other things that should throw up red flags for the viewer early on. But this is still a heck of a watch. The director's, Joseph Kosinski, first outing, ""Tron Legacy"", was not really very good. He's taken a huge leap forward here. This is a sweeping film with large scope, great camera movement and faster, more assured, pacing. I did not know where the story was headed and that's a good thing. Too often a movie telegraphs itself. This looked good, had great sets, good effects, good sound, music, editing and all the other production values in line with a project this size. Cruise is aging well. He plays a somewhat cocky character but not quite as severe as ""Top Gun's"" Maverick. Olga Kurylenko is a rising star, and her sweet, appeal works well here. Morgan Freeman is becoming Morgan Freeman so there aren't any real surprises there.

I was a bit confused on some aspects of the script but my guess is they'd be cleared up with a second viewing. But if you are a big fan of big sci-fi movies, this should fill your plate.",1366588800,3,1936,4.417366946778712
2288571,5,B0009ESTDW,"[THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE THEATRICAL VERSION.]

""Jack Harper: 60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated. Nothing human remains. We're here for drone repair. We're the ""mop-up crew"".

If you want to see a fun film with romance, excitement, plausible futuristic inventions, weaponry and computer-control, complete with Big Sister and the apparent salvation of the human race, watch this film.

The film's beginnings concern an apocalypse of sorts, where in 2017 Man won, at a terrible cost, a war with an alien invasion. The remnants of that war, fought by the alien Scavs, want Jack (Tom Cruise) but not to kill him but to capture him.

The cloud condo (I like to call it) has everything, complete with swimming facilities, showers, food and a hot red-headed, Brit-accented woman (Victoria) who also happens to be Jack's lover and communications officer.

Every morning Jack goes out on patrol, fixes downed drones, and they complain to ""management"" up in ""Tat"", a large module miles wide, that is shuttling the last of humanity to its new colony on Saturn's moon, Titan.

And every morning the communication from Tat asks , ""Are you an effective team?"" and all hell will break loose if it's other than ""Yes!""

Who could ask for more?

There's more to the story than that. We are introduced to an apparency. And like Matrix, there is more than meets the eye and all is revealed, in bits and pieces, as the alien resistance, led by Morgan Freeman's character, Beech, is also not all it seems.

Plots and Points:

I won't reveal much, just to say the story will be familiar to many sci-fi fans. The action is non-stop (but it's not a military film), and the story slowly unfolds (but it's not Matrix). The plausible machinery (the dragonfly-like helicopter-ship with space travel capability) and Jack's cool, futuristic motorcycle are fun to watch and experience.

The film's expostulation of what our world will be like is shocking - New York is completely wiped out. We have the library, subway system and the Brooklyn Bridge at hand. What sci-fi movie does NOT have the Statute of Liberty's arm up in the air, a common feature in these types of films since the Planet of the Apes!

Best scenes: Getting your cycle stolen from aliens. I mean, that's really a shame! The humor as Jack catches that ball at the stadium, site of the 2017 World Series. And the hideaway that Jack keeps, a mountain lake and cabin, with remnants of humanity's technology (great Jazz vinyl) unknown to his partner Victoria.

When a signal brings down Odyssey, a ship that's been in orbit ""pre-War"", and one survivor, a woman who had been in his flashback dreams, completely destroys all the harmony and substance of Jack's world and sends him on a frantic hunt to find the truth or meet elimination at the guns of drones!

Bottom Line: If you like your sci-fi with great scenes, seamless CGI and a constant plot with no pausing, then see this film. The film does take some concentration and if you're observant, you can follow along just fine. In fact I may get the DVD to fill in any points I missed.

IMAX, was worth it!

2288572,5,B0009ESTDW,"There may be spoilers.

Some critics have panned this new film from director and co-writer Joseph Kosinski, in this his second film (""TRON: Legacy""), as being highly derivative.  But let's face it, how many films are so fresh and new that they delve into uncharted territory?  In any case, don't care.  Whether it's a drama, a comedy, a horror movie or even a romantic comedy, it's how well it is delivered that counts.  And this film delivers.

Like ""TRON"" the film is visually arresting.  Seen on a big screen, the sets are huge but sparse, drawing the audience in.  Set in a war-ravaged Earth of 2077 devoid of humans, all of whom have resettled on a moon of Saturn, only Jack (terrific Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain.  They are partners (both romantic and professionally) whose mission is to watch over the drones that patrol the area for a smattering of ""Scavs"" who were the defeated invaders.  While Earth won the war, they lost the planet which continues to be harvested for water and other ecological matter.

Jack is the investigative repair man who goes out alone.  Victoria never leaves their high control point and guides him using sophisticated tracking technology.  While investigating an unusual radio beacon, Jack witnesses a spacecraft crash.  One of the survivors is a human flight officer named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who he has occasionally dreamed about.  Both Jack and Vic have had their memories ""washed"" in order to eliminate thoughts of the terrible war.  Uh, sure.  What Jack believes to be ""Scavs"" turns out to be Beech (Morgan Freeman) and his collection of survivors.  The truth is out there and Jack must find it, and does with the help of Julia.

Like ""TRON,""  ""Oblivion"" is beautiful to watch and has a great soundtrack, mostly provided by French electronic band, M83.  Yes, ""Oblivion"" borrows from a list of movies too long to mention, but for those of us who salivate for science fiction films with a breath of intelligence, this one does the trick.

BLU RAY REVIEW: In this subsequent viewing of this terrific sci-fi film, I was able to tie up a few elements I didn't quite understand the first time around.  I would also have to say this is one of the best looking movies of any genre I've seen.  The special features on the Blu ray disc add some clarity on how and why the filmmakers went for a certain look and it truly comes across beautifully.

The other thing I had missed the first time around was the romantic relationship between Jack and Victoria and subsequently Julia.  It was there but just wasn't a point of focus.  By ""there,"" I mean it wasn't explicit, either by subdued actions or love making.  Regarding the later, the most interesting coupling occurs in the swimming pool.  It seems clear that Jack's relationship with Victoria seems forced or maybe expected is a better word.  He does all the right things that husbands and wives do, but it seems like a matter of routine more than true love.  Watch Cruise's face during those intimate close ups.  Something is wrong.  Of course those memory flashbacks of Julia don't help.  When Jack finally does find Julia, it all clicks.  Not quickly, but you can see in Jack's reactions, he loves this woman.  But why?  In the end, he shows how much he loves her.  ""Oblivion"" is also a beautiful love story.

There is nothing like watching a beautiful movie like this on the big screen, but this Blu Ray transfer comes damn close.  The 1080p transfer is spectacular in every respect and certainly will be a show off piece to a good system.  It comes in the original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and does a great job replicating the original film.  The dystopian world is now essentially uninhabited and the stark whites and various shades contrast nicely with deep dark blacks.  When the story moves underground, shadows and shadings of grey prevail.  But even when Jack retreats to his cabin in the wilderness, we get beautiful greens and various earth tones in all their splendor.  I could see no encoding issues.  The contrast and detail are excellent.

Equaling the visuals is a magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track.  Again put this one on your demo list.  If you have sub-woofers, they will get a workout as the rumbles coming from many sources including gunfire, rockets and explosions.  The surrounds are constantly in play with movement from side to side, back and forth as the drone ships fly around.  Dialog is clear and well presented.  Ambient noise is ever present as well.

Extras include an excellent commentary track by Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski, a 48 minute ""making of"" documentary, some deleted scenes and get this, an isolated musical score by M83 in Dolby TruHD 5.1 (24 bit, 96kHz).  A great package to own.",1366588800,425,4761,4.762545899632803
2288573,2,B0009ESTDW,I am a big sci-fi fan and was really looking forward to seeing Oblivion.  This sci-fi post apocalyptic earth movie has great computer graphics but my wife and I felt the movie was long and tedious even though it's only 125 minutes.  Even Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman can only do so much to save this movie.,1366502400,9,307,4.368421052631579
2288574,4,B0009ESTDW,"Hot-shot pilot moves in expensive, cutting edge fighter jets, wide-scenic shots of Tom Cruise on a motorcycle...get ""Take My Breath Away"" out of your head - we're talking about Oblivion here! While the similarities between Oblivion and Top Gun end at the aforementioned, there is no question that ""Maverick"" has all the right moves to portray galactic mechanic, Jack Harper in the most visually dazzling film of the year so far.

Oblivion opens in 2077 after an alien threat has left Earth a barren wasteland fit only for extracting a few vital resources before humanity abandons the planet altogether to start a new existence on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cruise's Harper is a glorified serviceman who supervises and repairs the various resource-extraction devices along with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). As the two near the completion of their jobs on Earth, Harper begins having visions of his life prior to the mandatory memory-wipe that is required for service-workers. These visions lead him on a chain of events that cause him to question everything he thought he knew about his life.

Director Joseph Kosinski creates a vividly rich and nuanced futuristic environment where much of the technology feels like what truly is on the horizon. Kosinski directed 2010's under-rated visual spectacle, Tron Legacy, and it is apparent that he has his finger on the pulse of crisp, sci-fi style. Narrative-wise, Oblivion is a much more complex story than is likely expected. The complexities do provide some depth to the film and force the audience to pay close attention; however, the juxtaposition between the style and the narrative is not smooth. Occasionally, the film is forced into a lull as it tries to tie up its intricate plot points without sacrificing its visual pageantry. This is most apparent in the scenes that develop the sub-plot involving a human resistance leader named Beech (Morgan Freeman) and a mysterious NASA survivor named Julia (Olga Kurylenko).

Oblivion's chief attributes are clearly its visual elements. Freeman and Kurylenko's characters are thinly developed and the actors are mostly unremarkable. However, it is becoming more and more apparent that any film that features Morgan Freeman in any role is most likely not a bad movie. Thematically, the film is successful at developing some intriguing ideas about discovery and purpose. The film acts as a subtle homage to familiar films like Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even Wall-E. Speaking of familiar, the score is oddly reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films. This is simply an observation, but having Morgan Freeman in the film as well certainly makes one wonder if this is some form of statement. Regardless, while some will no doubt be puzzled or dissatisfied with the conclusion, Oblivion mostly works as an epic and visually alluring entry into the science-fiction canon. B+

On a side note, seeing the film in IMAX or an XTREME screen is recommended as the film has so much to offer visually. Oblivion is rated PG-13 and runs 125 minutes.",1366502400,4,3064,5.134268537074148
2288575,5,B0009ESTDW,"""Oblivion"" is great! This is how the story goes: 2077: Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) serves as a security repairmen stationed on an evacuated Earth. Part of a massive operation to extract vital resources after decades of war with a terrifying alien threat who still scavenges what's left of our planet, Jack's mission is almost complete. In a matter of two weeks, he will join the remaining survivors on a lunar colony far from the war-torn world he has long called home.

Living in and patrolling the breathtaking skies from thousands of feet above, Jack's soaring existence is brought crashing down after he rescues a beautiful stranger from a downed spacecraft. Drawn to Jack through a connection that transcends logic, her arrival triggers a chain of events that forces him to question everything he thought he knew. With a reality that is shattered as he discovers shocking truths that connect him to Earth of the past, Jack will be pushed to a heroism he didn't know he contained within. The fate of humanity now rests solely in the hands of a man who believed our world was soon to be lost forever.

The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Jack Harper) & Morgan Freeman (as Beech) is great. The directing by Joseph Kosinski (who also produced & wrote the screenplay and the comic book of which the movie is based on) is great. The screenplay by Kosinski, Karl Gajdusek & Michael Arndt (which is based on the comic book by Kosinski & Arvid Nelson) is great.

This is a well-done, well-crafted sci-fi / action / adventure film that is entertaining and well-made. This is a film that also has an interesting and intriguingly-done concept that is / or has been solidly interpreted on film. Tom Cruise gives a solidly great performance as Jack Harper. Joseph Kosinski has crafted a film that is completely different and original from his previous film, ""Tron: Legacy"", the sequel to ""Tron"".

2288576,5,B0009ESTDW,"There exists an ache deep within each of us, longing to know who we are, where we came from, and why we were created. Deep down in the core of our being, we know there is something more. Like Jack Harper, we do not want to simply live a purposeless life as the security repair man; a sterile life of a thousand repetitions.

In this sense, Jack typifies all of humanity in this movie. In him, we find the war waging within each of us. Do we allow ourselves to forget who we are? Do we give in to sin, and allow it to dull our intellect, even our memory? How many of us have lost our joy, our vigor for life. How far we have fallen indeed, and how sad and cynical we have become. Earth really *is* devastated. Yet there is still hope for humanity, in compassion, in love. In this way, Jack serves as a figure of all humanity, who's self-revelation marks a new beginning for mankind.

2288578,5,B0009ESTDW,"Over the course of the last few years, the science fiction genre of film has either provided major hits or complete misses.  Depending on who's acting and who's directing, movie-goes appear to be fairly picky about which sci-fi films they're willing to spend their money on.  In 2012, Prometheus took us back to the Aliens universe with critical and commercial success, while at the same time, Battleship and John Carter sank - ultimately drowning in a sea of misery.  Speaking of sci-fi success, Tom Cruise has been a part of a handful of lucrative sci-fi endeavors, including Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and War of the Worlds.  Now, Tom Cruise is back once again with another pre-summer box office smash, Oblivion.

Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Lecacy), Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the few remaining survivors of the planet earth - half of which has been destroyed and deemed uninhabitable after a nuclear war with an alien species, known as Scavs (Scavengers).  Harper, along with his partner and love interest, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are in charge of an operation to salvage and extract the last of earth's natural resources, prior to leaving earth and rejoining their fellow humans on a massive space station, called Titan.  However, everything is not as it seems when Jack saves a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage of a crash-landing - the same woman whom he has been having recurring memories and dreams.  And, after making contact with the Scavs, Jack must uncover the secrets behind the organization for which he has been working and the reasoning behind his absent memory (which was mandatorily removed) .  Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo also star in supporting roles.

First and foremost, do not leave the theater when you see this film - and you absolutely should see this film.  Oblivion is one of the films that will require your attention at all times, because it's extremely easy to miss a giant piece of the puzzle during a bathroom break or popcorn run.  The film's plot is relatively easy to decipher by the conclusion of the film, however, there's more going on in this film that you can possibly interpret in one sitting.  The introduction of the film crams a whole lot of information into your head to set up the present conundrum being tackled by Cruise's character, Jack Harper.  Clearly, he's involved in a snatch-n-grab job, hastily attempting to remove earth's resources, while attempting to avoid any difficulties or interaction with the supposed villains, the Scavs.  However, it's impossible to get specific about the majority of the film's plot points without spoiling the film.

Oblivion's cast is one of the most impressive features in this film and remains tremendously authentic from beginning to end in this enigmatic drama.  Tom Cruise hasn't been this enjoyable in quite a long time and really finds his groove with his character.  Reminiscent of the character from War of the Worlds, Jack Harper is mostly in the dark about the majority of the occurrences in this film and is often in over his head - yet somehow always manages to come out of each dire situation unscathed.  On the other hand, his partner (Victoria) constantly finds new ways to be jealous in a world where she has absolutely no competition.  At times, she can become an annoyance, but that's mostly due in large part to lack of her unwillingness to think outside the box (which is reserved solely for Tom Cruise's character).  Finally, let's face the fact here - everything is better with Morgan Freeman.

By far and away, the most enjoyable moments of the film revolve around the CGI action sequences - which include some very intriguing and well-designed drones.  These drones are the main agitators in a rather Empire Strikes Back-like flight batter which is also a nice flashback to Tom Cruise sitting in a cockpit in Top Gun.  It's unclear whether or not the filmmakers meant to create a throwback sci-fi Top Gun-style chase scene, but regardless, this specific flight chase will have you wishing for a Top Gun sequel (which was sadly cancelled after the death of its original director, Tony Scott).

Overall, there's absolutely nothing in Oblivion that hasn't been done in some other sci-fi before it.  Sure, it would be easy to say this is just another post-apocalyptic film with alien invaders, ultimately forcing humanity to unite for a greater good to defeat them.  Yet, this film is much more complex than your average space-invaders film.  It provides a busier (occasionally confusing) than usual plot (in Prometheus fashion), so if you look away, you'll most likely miss something important.  But, if you play close enough attention to the plot points, you'll be able to tie everything together in a nice, pretty bow when the credits role - hopefully coming to the conclusion that Oblivion is a perfectly fun and enjoyable sci-fi film.

2288579,4,B0009ESTDW,"In his follow-up effort to 2010's Tron: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski brings us Oblivion, a visually striking and futuristic sci-fi epic that boasts a strong performance from Tom Cruise and an intriguing, albeit recycled, story.

In 2017, Earth is transformed and deemed inhospitable due to an invasion by an alien race nicknamed the Scavs. Sixty years after this event, the human race has abandoned the planet for the Saturn moon of Titan. Only two humans remain, Jack (played by Tom Cruise), a security repairman who is tasked with fixing security drones, and Victoria (played by Andrea Riseborough), Jack's communications officer and partner. Due to join their fellow compatriots on the enormous space station known as the TET in two weeks, a vessel crash-lands on Earth and causes Jack to question everything he knows about the people he trusts, his mission, and ultimately himself.

The biggest achievement of the film belongs to Kasinski, who's vision and direction make this film an absolute wonder to behold. Much like Tron: Legacy, Oblivion contains breathtaking landscapes and dazzling futuristic designs. The look and feel of decimated Earth is truly spectacular and oddly realistic. It's an amazing achievement in visual effects, and it's for this reason alone that seeing the film is worth it.

Another impressive factor of the movie is the cast, which is quite small. Jack and Victoria get the bulk of the screen time as the first half of the film is devoted almost entirely to them. Luckily, Cruise and Riseborough have a great chemistry and pull of the ""last two people on Earth"" thing quite nicely. Cruise continues to prove age has not diminished his action-star status and he's particularly good here. The film is more character-driven than the previews would have you believe so having a versatile and well-known actor in the lead spot is a definite plus. A lot of credit also has to be given to Riseborough who is absolutely brilliant in her role as the content worker bee who doesn't want to see the facts laid out in front of her.

The one caveat most people seem to have with the movie is that it heavily borrows ideas from many other sci-fi flicks, including Moon, the Matrix, Total Recall, and Eagle Eye to name a few. I find this kind of silly because most sci-fi films borrow from each other in some way or another and while most of Oblivion's ideas may not be entirely original, the execution and visuals more than make up for this. It's an inventive and strikingly beautiful sci-fi epic that holds it's own when it comes to character development and overall story. If you're a fan of sci-fi (or any of the above-mentioned films) definitely check this out.",1366416000,,2679,4.881318681318682
2288580,5,B0009ESTDW,"This is my first new science fiction movie I've seen in quite a while, and was well-worth viewing. The entire cast did a good job with acting performance, and visual and sound effects are excellent. In comparison to other science fiction movies such as Independence Day, the action in this one is much slower, but entertains from start to finish. The story is intriguing, and I was content with the part that Tom Cruise played. I've seen him in other science fiction movies, and his acting fits well within this thrilling story. There is enough events going on throughout the film to hold your attention, along with suspense for the final conclusion. Overall, enjoyable and highly entertaining. Recommended to all those who enjoy thrilling, science fiction movies!",1366329600,19,764,5.0236220472440944
2288581,4,B0009ESTDW,"What do you get when combine the themes from Kubrick, Spielberg, Scott and The Wachowskis sci-fi masterpieces along with some elements of Mass Effect and the mind of director Joseph Kosinski? You get Oblivion an unoriginal, but yet visually stunning and a fun and entertaining sci-fi film.

The film was adapted from Kosinski's own graphic novel with the same name. It is 2077 the moon is destroyed and the Earth has been devastated by the event along with the war with the Scavs that took place sixty years ago. Humans won the war, but had to leave after it became an irradiated waste land. The remnants of the human race migrated to Titan a moon orbiting Saturn. Back on Earth a two person mop up crew of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) repair the drones that protect the machines that harvest Earths resources to take back to Titan. The couple lives a quiet life with just two weeks left to go on their mission. Victoria is content and can't wait to head to Titan. Jack on the other hand yearns for more in life. He has a longing to remain on Earth, and has even found a private Oasis where he has built a home along with that and his dreams of a seeing a beautiful woman on the Empire State Building compels him to explore Earth and collect artifacts and take risks, which get him into trouble and realizations about Earth, the Scavs and himself.

Does the story take elements from other films like other critics have voice in their reviews? Yes without question Oblivion does. There are elements from films like Planet of the Apes, 2001 and The Matrix to name a few, but that shouldn't take away from someone's enjoyment of Oblivion. It is virtually impossible to come up with an originally idea with everything have been done before. It is up to the writers and directors to bring their own take on the themes and story along with trying to create a unique vision that will captivate, and bring wonder to the audience. Kosinski wasn't able to create something truly unique, but he was able to bring his vision to life. The story is pretty well done, and yes there are two predictable moments some audience members will be able to predict like who is the bad guy in the film. I was able to discern that pretty quickly, but there are a couple of twists I didn't see coming and certainly don't think most views will be able to predict. The romance and chemistry between Jack, Victoria and Julia Rusakova (Olga Kurylenko) is genuine and believable, and plays an important role in the film.

Tom Cruise has garnered some criticism in his last handful of films for basically playing the same character and rightfully so. There isn't a whole lot of difference between characters Roy Miller, Ethan Hunt, Jack Reacher or even Stacee Jaxx. Tom Cruise has proven he's a very capable actor he just needs good director to push him out of his comfort zone like Michael Mann did in Collateral or Steven Spielberg did in Minority Report or Oliver Stone did in Born on the Fourth of July, and here in Oblivion he's given one of his best performances in years. Is it on par with some of his best? Absolutely not, but he does give a good performance showing what he is capable of and giving a wider range of performance besides his lad back happy go lucky smiley face performances he's given us in his last couple of roles. The two leading ladies also give good performances in their roles of Jack's loves. Andrea Riseborough is believable as Victoria and you can clearly see her love for Jack. All she wants to do his go to Titan with Jack, so when shows emotions like betrayal and regret it's all the more believable and meaningful. The beautiful Olga Kurylenko also does a good job as the mysterious Julia who Jack rescues. Just like Riseborough she does a nice job of conveying emotion. Morgan Freeman as Malcolm Beech is given a lot of screen time in the trailers, but in Oblivion he is just a supporting character. Beech isn't the best character for the likes of Freeman, but the actor does a decent job with the Beech and the character does play a pivotal role in the film.

The action is sparse in Oblivion, but when it happens it is extremely well done whether it is an airborne chase through a storm and canon or a battle in a bunker the action is riveting, and the special effects are really well done. The detailed ruined Earth that was created is beautiful and richly detailed. That combined with the cinematography done by Claudio Miranda makes Oblivion one of the most gorgeous sci-fi films. Miranda is the same person who helped bring the world of Life of Pi to life. Just like in Tron Legacy where Kosinski brought Daft Punk in to give soul to the film he does the same here in Oblivion by bringing in M83 to do much of the films score with Joseph Trapanese. Together the two give sadness and soul when it is needed along with adrenalin boost where it is most needed. The two match the score to the scenes perfectly.

I have never read Oblivion the comic, but from what I've read Kosinski had been trying to get this film done for years, until he basically gave up and made his story into a comic. Finally being allowed to bring his vision of a futuristic world to life director Joseph Kosinski does a pretty good job with his follow up to Tron Legacy. This is his baby he birthed and brought to life basically on his own. He had a clear vision of what he wanted to create and it generally worked. Kosinski is a talented director and I can't wait to see what is next for him which is hopefully the sequel to Tron Legacy.

I understand the critics, but even with Oblivion being inspired by and taking elements from other sci-fi classics Oblivion along with writer and director Kosinski still managed to bring to life a stunning sci-fi vision with a pretty good story, good acting, great visuals and action, a great score and pretty good directing. I originally had high expectations for Oblivion, and while not living up to them Oblivion is still a good sci-fi film that I recommend to sci-fi fans and people who just want to have a good time.",1366329600,2,6079,4.511796733212341
2288582,3,B0009ESTDW,"In ""Oblivion,"" Tom Cruise plays a repair tech named Jack Harper who travels an abandoned Earth in the year 2077 fixing robot drones. A war broke out years ago with the nomadic Scavs, the only threat still roaming the planet. While the Scavs lost the war, they destroyed the moon and made Earth uninhabitable. Now Jack and his assigned team mate Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are the only two people left while the rest of the population relaxes comfortably on Titan located on Saturn's moon. Despite a mandatory memory wipe for everyone on the planet, Jack still dreams of a woman that isn't Victoria. He begins to question his mission when a spaceship known as The Odyssey crash lands near Jack while he's out on a run and the woman from his dreams literally falls into his lap.

The only other film Joseph Kosinski has directed is ""TRON: Legacy,"" so does that mean the soundtrack has to sound exactly the same? To be clear, the soundtrack isn't bad but you kind of write it off because it sounds so similar to Daft Punk's soundtrack of Kosinski's previous film. The one main difference is that there is a ton of synthesizer near the end of ""Oblivion,"" so much that you can actually picture an astronaut on the moon playing a keyboard guitar during the slower moments of the film.

That sense of familiarity seriously plagues ""Oblivion"" because it will remind you of at least half a dozen different movies during its just over two hour duration. Tom Cruise seems to intentionally make nods to ""Top Gun"" while flying his futuristic dragonfly-shaped helicopter thing. He even pulls out a pair of aviator sunglasses and places them on a shelf in this delicate ""remember this?"" kind of manner. ""Oblivion"" seems to make the mistake of having an expected sci-fi plot point in its loins without much of anything else to back it up. To get there, it piggybacks on the likes of ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""Independence Day,"" and ""Moon."" The issue is it feels like it doesn't try hard enough to leave a big enough impact to actually be remembered by the end of the year let alone six months from now. ""Oblivion"" is like a clone of a clone of a good sci-fi film.

Tom Cruise spends a lot of time flying around, sticking his fingers deep into the innards of broken robots, and turning them on. All you'd need is for him to whisper dirty things to them while his fist is still inside them and you'd have some futuristic porno on your hands. ""Oblivion"" is absolutely breathtaking to watch. Earth may be deserted, but it's still beautiful in this empty kind of way. The lush landscapes are incredible. Pretty much anything involving the drones is a lot of fun. In a way, ""Oblivion"" is a lot like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" since the futuristic technology is really creative and just a blast for the audience in general. The drones make so many beeps and boops that you know somewhere R2D2 is getting a stiffy. If you have an inner sci-fi nerd, the intense visuals and electronic sounds of the film may give you the same reaction. There's a drone chase sequence near the end of the film that is pretty outstanding.

But somehow everything else going on is really dull. Tom Cruise is torn between two beautiful women? How tragic! Morgan Freeman shows up long enough to do his best Morpheus impression and smoke a cigar in the dark. You can see where the film is going to go, but poor Jack takes an extra 45 minutes to get there because he's got to figure out who this other woman is (which you can figure out the second or third time he dreams about her). Most importantly you won't care where the film is going to go. You can see the big finale coming once Jack returns to that cabin for the second time. The story being told is just so dry and stale. Imagine clipping coupons with a lightsaber or using warp speed on the Star Trek Enterprise to get to the laundromat to fold clothes and stretch either of those tasks out for two hours and you have ""Oblivion.""

""Oblivion"" is visual science fiction ecstasy yet is so structurally boring that you'll be edging towards the door two thirds of the way through the film. It attempts to mold this futuristic adventure out of borrowed concepts and mimicked ideas from similar genre films, but it does not compute. It is not an effective team.",1366243200,8,4284,4.572916666666667
2288583,4,B0009ESTDW,"""Based on a graphic novel"" means another comic book-based story. I'm sure you expect subtle nuances and sophisticated philosophizing, but.... In this dystopian setting (of course) we visit the ruins of well-known American landmarks as our hero is sent to finish the eradication of a few survivors who cling to the remnants of Earth after an interplanetary war. The moon has been destroyed and we see the effects of the resulting earthquakes, while aliens ""farm"" the remaining water. Computer Generated Imaging is used very effectively, although some of this was shot in Iceland, California, New York and Louisiana. The Empire State Building is a critical element.

It is impossible to talk about the plot without revealing important points, so rather than do an entire review that is a spoiler, I'll stay pretty general.

We see:
  * Tom Cruise (""Jack Reacher"" and ""Rock of Ages"") is more appealing than usual; this time he plays the stalwart soldier on assignment to ""mop up"" any survivors.
  * Morgan Freeman (""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""Dolphin Tale"""") is one of those survivors trying to avoid being ""mopped up.""
  * Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Headhunters"" and ""Game of Thrones"") is currently my favorite Danish actor. His character is another one of those survivors attempting to remain alive on Earth.
  * Andrea Riseborough (""Disconnect"" and ""W.E."") is our hero's partner, sharing that mop-up assignment.
  * Olga Kurylenko (""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Paris je t'aime"") is the survivor of a crash, rescued by our hero.
  * Melissa Leo (""The Fighter"" and ""Flight"") is the Commander's voice and face on the communications screen, issuing orders to our mop-up crew.

Pay close attention to the plot, as it is satisfactorily complex. I liked one ""sink hole"" that turned out to be the ruins of the New York City Library. Please note that this cast has been assembled in keeping with Tom Cruise's international stardom. His movies are successful throughout the world and they keep his fans in mind when his movies are cast. This is a very good one for him.

This is rated PG-13, so expect lots and lots of gunfire, no sweaty bodies, a couple of swear words and nudity only alluded to, but the crux of the story is a ""mind-wipe"" that erases memory, so pay close attention. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.",1366156800,2,2314,4.925257731958763
2288584,2,B0009ESTDW,"Here is Tom Cruise's latest movie in a single sentence: It's ""WALL-E"" with a heavy dose of ""Moon"" and ""Total Recall,"" and a touch of ""The Matrix"" and/or ""Terminator.""

If you've seen these movies -- and most other sci-fi from the last thirty years -- ""Oblivion"" will seem oddly familiar. Admittedly, being derivative isn't necessarily a death blow to a movie. But being dull and spiritless is -- and while director Joseph Kosinski crafts a truly beautiful, brilliant post-apocalyptic world to play in, he never crafts a story or characters half as interesting.

Sixty years ago, an alien invasion was repelled... but not before they destroyed the moon... which seems to have just made Earth temporarily inhospitable rather than permanently lifeless. The human race has evacuated to Titan, and the only ones left are a ""clean-up crew"" who live in an iHouse high in the clouds, and use drones to exterminate the alien ""scavs.""

WALL-E... sorry, I mean Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is regularly sent out to repair drones, but he's more interested in the ruined remnants of human civilization. But one day he finds cryo-pods from a crashed ship, and barely manages to save one of the survivors, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) -- whom he recognizes from half-recalled memories.

While trying to help her out, Jack stumbles across a small band of surviving humans, led by Beech (Morgan Freeman) -- and he finds that they are planning to blow up the TET, a human space station. When Jack refuses, Beech sends him off on a quest to discover the truth rather than... well, just telling him what's going on.

Joseph Kosinski has only done two movies, but he's already developing a distinct style: bland story and gorgeous visuals. ""Oblivion"" is a truly beautiful movie, with sweeping views of an Earth that has been completely devastated, but is slowly being reclaimed by nature. The only oasis is the cold, sterile iHouse, set in a perpetually rosy cloudbank atop a slender pillar. It leaves you thinking that Kosinski has dreamed up designs for the entire planet, and just wants to tour his postapocalyptic world.

Unfortunately, the plot is a Frankenstein's monster of other sci-fi movies. Almost everything in this movie has been done better elsewhere, either directly ripping it off (""Moon"") or in cliche form (oh dearie me, what IS the connection between Julia and Jack?). And there's no passion or energy behind anything that happens -- it all feels bland and generic.

And Kosinski is just awful at expositing anything that ISN'T ripped off from those other movies. Major plot twists flew directly over my head because of how blandly they were revealed -- for example, the big reveal involving the TET.

Sadly the characters are just as bland and generic as the story. Tom Cruise is basically playing the Generic Tom Cruise Action Hero here -- a good, morally-upright guy who has some murky stuff in his past. Even the character's NAME sounds like a GTCAH name. Cruise gives a decent performance, but he's definitely not stepping outside his action-hero box -- and the character is so blandly nondescript he probably couldn't even if he wanted to.

None of these characters have pasts, quirks, other relationships, or anything to really flesh them out -- they're as blandly uninteresting as the plot.. Kurylenko is pretty awful, Freeman is phoning it in, and Melissa Leo and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau aren't given enough to do. The only really good performance is Andrea Riseborough as Harper's lover/partner, who is made pretty miserable by his attraction to Julia. But alas, she also is not given much to do, and is gotten rid of when she becomes inconvenient.

""Oblivion"" is a visually entrancing movie, but the Frankenstein plot left me feeling empty and bored. Directed by someone other than Kosinski, it might have been an astounding film... but instead we just get a bland, forgettable one.",1365984000,16,3879,4.963020030816641
2288585,3,B0009ESTDW,"Oblivion is a movie that projects great expectations, delivers even greater CGI (its smoothless and does not detract from the movie as some CGI in other movies has a propensity to do); however the ending causes this film to fall quite flat on its face. If there is one major fault with Oblivion its that there is a sense that it draws far too much on past Sci-fi movies (I found myself comparing particular scenes with previous movies - some now quite dated - and such reminicising drew me away from the premise of the movie itself) with the ending (no-spoiler here) pretty well much a re-make of a well known, but now quite aged, sci-fi movie (and thus a real dissapointment).

Oblivion is an enticing journey into a post (dare I say) apocalyptic earth where mankind has truimphed over an alien invasion and Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is left behind with his 'partner' as a cleanup/srvice 'mechanic' of giant sea converters. I am not a particular fan of Tom Cruise however here he harks back to his better days of acting and carries this film with a degree of aplom. Like other reviews here, I agree that there is far too little exposure of humans and how they have coped with life in this new earth and much more could have been done to explore this aspect, furthermore I was very dissapointed at the 'Alien' content and the ending of the film reinforced this, as in how they, the aliens, were portrayed.

Oblivion started well, built at an excellent rate, maintained my interest - and then suddenly fell completely on its face at the end :( (hence only 3 stars and 2.5 of them are for the CGI and the futuristic technology). Oblivion is still a good movie to see, however in my 'humble' opinion its not a GREAT movie - watch it, enjoy it, just don't have too many great expectations (sic).",1365897600,5,1790,4.521604938271605
2288586,4,B0009ESTDW,"The scene set as we are lead into an impressive post-apocalyptic Earth, the textures and colours are vivid and almost photo shopped; the remnants of Man's world are literally fused into the landscape, or disintegrating amphitheatre of an American football stadium, we are shown the pitiful spire of the Empire State Building. This is all the result of a Pyrrhic victory against extra-terrestrial interlopers called `Scavengers', in principle the human race has essentially given up on Earth.

On this `barren' world there appears to be a couple who are doing their stint as caretakers to help maintain harvesters that are harvesting the last of Earth's riches water for fuel - and mopping up `Scavengers'. What is left of Humanity lives on a large orbiting satellite while the rest have moved to Titan. Jack, who does the maintenance has a partner called Victoria, who is a communications specialist and lover, they live in `Sky deck', high up off the ground, a rather amazing uncluttered command centre. They even have a glass bottom swimming pool for tempting night dips.

If we look past the visuals of landscaping a post-apocalyptic world, the interesting futuristic Sky deck residence, `bubble-copters' and amazing colour palette of photography. The story while interesting, the components that make up the whole have been borrowed from a number of other films and the ending while drawing together the story threads, was disappointing, because it based on movie's perception of alien intelligence or lack of it.
