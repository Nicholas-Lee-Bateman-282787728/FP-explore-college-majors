2769529,4,B000NJL51Q,"The depth of research and thought that went in to this DVD is as evident as it is vast.  The interview is filled with interesting information, charm and charisma.  Believe the Cross origins or not, this DVD is no doubt worth the time to watch it.",1206576000,4,246,4.326086956521739
2769530,4,B000NJL51Q,"This interview with author Crichton Miller is a great resource for anyone interested in the origin and subsequent uses of the Celtic or ""wheel"" cross, which are closely linked to navigation and astrology. Accompanying images make the history even more clear. I give this high marks because Miller is easy to follow and understand, a painless learning experience.",1198627200,3,362,5.258620689655173
2769531,1,B000NJL51Q,"I was very disappointed  with this DVD for the following reasons:

1. The cover suggests that Crichton Miller stars on the DVD (as his name is in bold), However, it DOES NOT include him at all, but Phillip Gardiner.

2. There is an annoying, awful new age-ish music playing in the background all the time (sorry guys but get a life whats wrong with just a plain old documentary, if I want to chill out I'll do my own thing).

3. But mainly, there is absolutely no order to the DVD at all. It just starts off without any decent introduction to the subject area and assumes you already know averything about the subject.

4. It is a simplistic presentation which is a great shame as the subject area is so interesting and it has not been of value to the original work of Crichton Miller.

Shame.",1182384000,23,793,4.360544217687075
2769532,5,B000NJL51Q,"One of the most astute, brilliant scholars of our modern-era that I have had the distinct privilege of reviewing on ancient wisdom topics. But not only is Mr. Miller an expert on this subject-matter beyond a doubt, but his articulate manner of speech coupled with Scottish charm and deep-humility make this DVD a collector's item. This is one of those Joseph Campbell-like interviews that you want to watch over and over again, perhaps, during every change of season, the equinoxes and solstices. For once you grasp the significance of what this man is telling us, you gasp at its implications: There is a wiser way to work with the world -- not against it. It speaks to seafaring technology before satellites, GPS and computers that is spell-binding in its simplicity but mind-blowing in the manner that it was employed to circumnavigate our globe in the Dark Ages? Get this audiovisual masterpiece from a true master craftsman while our oil-based, nuclear-powered, toxic, planet-destroying civilization still has electricity. And, by the way: Happy Earth Day!

2769533,5,B000NJL51Q,"This DVD crossed my desk yesterday and I am so pleased that it did. This ""Reality"" company seem to be churning out some excellent and thought provoking DVD's at present and this is yet another in the line that will not disappoint. Crichton Miller interviewed here for the first time by his long-term friend and best selling author, Philip Gardiner, reveals the wonderful simplicity of the Cross of Thoth or Celtic Cross. Beautiful imagery and music make this a spell-binding experience. Very much recommended.",1175731200,7,509,5.071428571428571
8178247,5,B000NJL51Q,"This is an interview with Crichton Miller, a guy that was trying to figure how the Pyramids were built with such great precision. While he was thinking of what the Egyptians could have used for instrumentation, he began piecing together what - just via utility - looked like a Celtic cross. The rest is very interesting history. He actually figured out that the Celtic cross was originally an instrument used to navigate with. But he went on to discover that the Egyptians invented something that works in much the same way (measuring angles based on star locations to obtain location) but is vastly more accurate. Very interesting and thought-provoking interview.",1430265600,,664,5.045454545454546
8178248,1,B000NJL51Q,Not the best quality. I returned this product. Music is loud and its hard to hear the narration.,1418947200,,96,4.388888888888889
8178249,2,B000NJL51Q,Sometimes music is too loud!,1411344000,,28,4.8
8178250,3,B000NJL51Q,this video promises  a lot and delivers little.  they talk around the subject but if you want to know what the subject is really composed of you must read their books.  would not buy this again and indeed have not purchased any of the other videos in this group.,1399507200,,262,4.3061224489795915
8178251,5,B000NJL51Q,"Great DVD explaining the use of the Celtic Cross as a navigation device, this Scottsman even got patents on it!",1286582400,,111,4.6
8178252,4,B000NJL51Q,On this DVD the author claims a connection between the ancient world of Egypt and the Celtic cross. A work which is not easy to carry out for an individual who has a great interest in the subject but is not related to any academy. I recently enjoyed many products of new and independent researchers and would always value good knowledge regardless who can present it. The facts to relate the cross to Thoth are not always very strong. It would have been possible to refer the title to the  'Origins of the Celtic cross' because the focus is on that.,1243296000,,549,4.435643564356436
8178253,4,B000NJL51Q,"Have you ever thought about where the most sacred symbols come from? This film explains the origins of the Celtic cross, ancient origins that came from astronomy, astrology, religion and history. This is a fascinating film about mankind's most revered symbol.",1236124800,,259,5.341463414634147
8178254,2,B000NJL51Q,"Normally I stick to reviewing the content being presented, but this video is so bad you can barely concetrate on it enough to remember it. If you are the type of person who can easily tune out distractions you may be able to watch this. If you have any trouble concentrating when distractions are present, do not buy this film as the background music intrudes seriously on the film. As another veiwer mentioned there is also a problem with the DVD playing correctly. My Blu-ray player was the only one in the house able to play it completely through and even it had problems showing the beginning as it froze several times for way more than a few seconds.

About the sound: This narrator does have something good to say that ""could"" be enjoyed if it weren't for the constant background music. This sedate, very low-key gentleman is trying to talk to us about his ideas while competing with wailing guitars, pop vocal music and other terrible background music. Ever try in vain to listen to your favorite radio station as another station begins to cross-talk on top of it??? This is the effect you get on this DVD.

From what I've been able to figure out Phillip Gardiner is the director of this entire series and it was produced on a home computer using a combination of interview footage, cheesy computer graphic images of crosses and music from friends. He should definitly stick to writing as he knows zero about production values. The interludes meant to segway between interview segments are where you find the graphics and they go on MUCH TOO LONG, so long that you quickly realize how little information is really contained in the film. Keep the fast forward button handy but don't hit the skip chapter button because this DVD has very few of them and you may find yourself at the end.

If you insist on adding this information to your home library, I would highly suggest that you save a few dollars and buy the audible audio version or rent the video from amazon. While the sound is no better, (read the review someone posted on audible) at least you don't have to endure the visual shock of going from a man sitting in tan monochrome clothing to garish graphics that add nothing to the interviews. Also note that they look even worse if you have a large high-def screen.

I own this DVD and one other in the series, ""Gateways to the Otherworld"" which is 10 times WORSE than this one (see my other review). You may notice that even the reviewers linked to magazines that make their money hawking films like this give relatively low marks to some of the DVD's in this series. Read the low reviews first and if any echo what I've said here, heed their advice. You may also notice as I did (too late) that with one or two exceptions ALL OF THE 4 and 5 star reviewers of Gardiners films appear on ALL of Gardiner's films and for the most part are given low marks by other reviewers. They also don't seem to have much of a review history beyond his films. What does that suggest to you??

Think twice about buying anything with Gardiner's name listed as DIRECTOR.

Also note that Amazon's return policy on CD's and DVD's that are open and found defective is limited to replacement not straight refund.

The problem here appears to be that the Gardiner didn't divide this DVD into enough chapters. I have seen this kind of freezing happen on other DVD's that have few or no chapters. My guess is that your DVD player is using the chapter layout to neatly grab chunks of data and it has a limited buffer for what is waiting to be played. When that chunk is too big it freezes up. If that is the problem you can send this DVD back endlessly and never solve the problem.",1227139200,15,3670,4.493253373313343
8178255,1,B000NJL51Q,"I wish there was a way to give zero stars. This DVD took several tries to even get through it once. In fact, I was never able to watch chapter 3 all the way through because it kept stalling and then skipping to the beginning of chapter 4 without me even pressing a button on the remote. The main failures of this DVD fall into two categories: First, the disk was of such poor quality that it would not play. It kept freezing and stalling in the same places on 4 seperate devices (including my PC). Secondly, the comments about the music (which I ignored before buying, based on my intense personal interest in the subject) are spot-on. The music is so distracting it takes away focus from the narrative, which is infuriatingly softer than the ""background"" music. Its like trying to listen to a conversation in a loud bar atmosphere ... impossible to follow, and increasingly annoying especially since I really, really wanted to hear what was being covered. Please listen to the comments about the music. They are legitimate. And also avoid purchasing this because the quality of the product is so poor that it never did play all the way through even after dozens of tries on various players. AAAArrrghh!

UPDATE 2012:
I kept looking for information on this subject. And I'm eternally grateful that I did. I found more truth about who Thoth really is in the ""Freedom Teachings"" by Ashayana Deane. She's recently split from the MCEO and formed her own organization called ""ARhAyas Productions AMCC"" ... yep, she's still as 'eccentric' as she was with the MCEO ... but if you can get past her personality filter the material she shares about the truth of what's really going on in this matrix can't be touched by any other source in this reality. She's got the goods... especially on this character ""Thoth"" (aka Merlin, Hermes Trismegistus, John the Baptist etc...) Google ""Freedom Teachings"" for the material up to 2012. But if you want the latest stuff keep looking for ""ARhAyas Productions"" OR ""ALHumBhra"" and note she's now going by the name E'Asha Ashayana.

Knowing what I now know after studying the Freedom Teachings for almost two years I suspect the 'music' on this production was intended to do more than distract you. Sound is a powerful tool.",1226793600,18,2252,4.74234693877551
8178256,2,B000NJL51Q,"I thought this DVD would uncover and disclose an intimate connection between Thoth and the Celtic cross (Not!!)to the contrary it does no such thing. It seems to focus on the most annoying background music for all time. Maybe Gardner was just using this to promote his book, but this wasn't good. Next time a little more archeaological proofs and a lot less of that inferno music!!",1216512000,6,381,4.701492537313433
