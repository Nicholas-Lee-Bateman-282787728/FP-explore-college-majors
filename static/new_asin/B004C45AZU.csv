4324672,4,B004C45AZU,"A nicely packaged human interest story about a mixed group escaping from Siberia to India in early WWII. Tragedy is all around and occasionally visits this group. The cinematography is excellent and the varying landscapes right out of National Geo. Most of the main characters are well developed led by a mix of better and lesser known actors.

There is not a huge amount of modern bling in this film so one has to like this genre to stick with it. The film also moves rather quickly between landscapes over a several thousand mile trek to fit in 133 minutes leaving one feeling a lot of character interaction was missed giving it a documentary sense at times.

The story is based on a book, not sure it's a true story or not.  And I haven't read the book so I can't compare it to that.
When I started watching it I had no idea what the story was about.  But it hooked me.  I found the variety of characters interesting and so was the very bleak and brutal world they were in.  A good story takes you on a journey and this one definitely takes you on one.  Plus I had no idea where it was going, which is always fun.
It follows a group of prisoners stuck in Siberia in the 1940s as they make a plan to escape.
Great cast, good characters, good dialogue, some beautiful scenery and tragedies along the way.

4324712,4,B004C45AZU,"Just before viewing ""The Way Back,""  I had, quite by coincidence, seen ""Papillon."" another escape movie, and one that's well worth seeing.  Where the impediment to escape in ""Papillon"" is a prison camp and, latterly, the isolation of Devil's Island, in ""The Way Back,"" it's nature that provides the challenge.  How are the escapees from a Soviet camp in Siberia going to make it to safety over very unforgiving terrain -- safety being India, thousands of miles away.  At first, there's the matter of getting away from the guards and soldiers, but after that it's literally into the wild -- bitter cold, soul-frying heat, deserts, mountains, open areas with little cover, and a with a young woman who has fled a camp too and who is allowed to carry on with them.  The characters are not as sharply defined as those played by Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen in ""Papillon,"" but they are given sufficient distinctness that creates just enough tension to give a human interest to the story -- but at bottom, it's man v. nature, and what matters are food and water, shade and shelter, and pain and fatigue are much more to be feared than disagreements about procedure.  The actors are all fine -- Ed Harris is the biggest name, playing Mr. Smith, a grizzled American caught up by the Soviets c. 1941 and shipped off to the camp.  The leader, if he is one, is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), a Pole whose wife has been tortured into informing against him -- a harrowing early scene.  Colin Farrell plays Valka, a ruthless criminal and gambler, and gives a performance that's as unglamorous as can be, and who surprises the others and the viewer about halfway through the movie.  The young woman, Irena, is played by Saoirse Ronan.  The others include another Russian (Mark Strong), a Latvian, and a Yugoslav (Gustav Skargard and Dragos Bucur respectively).  All of them are just fine, and I suppose that, in sum, they are disposed as they are to remind us of the scope of Soviet tyranny.  All of them take pains to avoid meeting people en route, for they assume that they will be reported, and very little of the suspense is generated by the danger of capture -- unlike ""Papillon"" in that respect.

In many ways, though, it's Peter Weir's camera that keeps us as engaged as the characters do.  The cinematographer Russell Boyd does a great job in catching the beauty and the dangerousness of the varied landscapes through which the escapees pass.  National Geographic was involved with the production, and you can believe it when you see the landscapes, but even as they strike us as beautiful, exotic, remote, or whatever, Weir never allows us to forget that they are first and foremost challenges to the ingenuity, courage, and doggedness of the little group.  I don't think it's giving too much away to say that not all of them make it to India -- but some of those who don't don't die either.  If I have a quibble, it would be that, as in ""Papillon,"" the ending is wrapped up a bit too quickly, and that's a problem given that it's the Himalayas that are the final hurdle.  And the coda -- visually klutzy -- covering the years from 1944 -1989 (the fall of communism) is sentimental in  way the body of the film never is.",1435708800,,3210,4.62962962962963

4324714,4,B004C45AZU,Ed Harris and Colin Farrell headline a strong cast of escapees from a desolate Russian Siberian POW camp.  The story is loosely based on the published actual event memoires by the same name.  On the trek to freedom they must overcome some of the most scenic but harshly brutal terrain in the world.  The parties deteriation and jubilation is realistically explored.  HD will put you right with them!,1434499200,,399,4.823529411764706
4324715,4,B004C45AZU,"In The Way Back, Ed Harris portrays life in a gulag fairly accurately. I am impressed by how Ed Harris starts the movie, with the governments attempting to force Janusz to sign a confession for a crime he did not commit. This beginning scene lead me to respect Harris for his historical accuracy. He even includes how the Russian government would use peoples family to try to sign the confession. Most of the life in the Gulag is accurate including professional criminals running the bunks, the hard work in the mines, and the minimal food given to the prisoner's. The most accurate of these three aspects is easily the portrayal of how the professional criminals ran the bunks. These criminals could demand anything from a petty criminal of political prisoner and they would have to give it up. In the movie, exactly this happens when a petty criminal in striped of his sweater and it is given to a professional criminal. However, I feel that Mr. Harris's choice for Janusz to give a prisoner half of his soup on the first night helps to develop character, but takes away from historical accuracy. In the gulags, each prisoner needed all the food they could get their hands on. Overall, I enjoyed watching the movie and was enthralled by all the dangers and problems the group of prisoners had to overcome throughout their journey.",1433894400,,1332,4.745689655172414

4324719,5,B004C45AZU,"An epic journey of perseverance and survival that needs to be told to the younger generations! There aren't many people left, especially in North America, who know and understand the horrors of the socialist gulag system. In contract to the Nazi concentration camps, the gulags were designed to kill the inmates slowly, in order to fully exploit them first in extreme manual labor. These camps served both a punitive and economic purpose for the Soviets - millions perished while in the most horrible conditions possible while building the Transiberian railway or logging the Taiga, or working in mines; all the labour entailed very high mortality rates, mostly from starvation.
One of the world's most skilled and underrated film directors, Peter Weir chose to tell the story of one of the most incredible journeys ever - a 4000 mile trek from a gulag near Lake Baikal all the way to Northern India. Research will show some controversy regarding the veracity of the story, but as Weir himself put it - there is enough evidence that some escapees did indeed make the trek, though we might never know who it really was.
For those interested in history and human journey, this film is highly recommended. The gorgeous cinematography and jaw-dropping landscapes help make the journey of the characters truly epic. Anchored with solid performances from a good ensemble, The Way Back is a difficult and harrowing story that will leave the viewer satisfied at the end; and may even prompt them to look into the subject further. Which is warranted - this piece of 20th century history is woefully undertold.",1431907200,,1600,4.973880597014926

4324721,4,B004C45AZU,"This is not so much an entertainment, as an education. It is about human cruelty and the horrors that we visit on each other all too often. But--trite as it sounds--it is also about the indomitable nature of the human spirit.

As it follows the little troop of escapees from the Soviet gulag c. 1940, it is very hard to watch. The harshness and brutality of their trek to freedom tears at the heart. It's horribly sad when some of the best of them die along the way. But against all odds, a few of them make it. These characters (not to mention the real people the story was based on) show us how they did it. The question that no one can possibly answer is: Why did they have to do it? Where does Stalin's (and Hitler's and Mao's and Pol Pot's and...) evil come from?

Special kudos to Ed Harris, in one of the most powerful performances of his career. He not only plays the part, but looks it, too. (More so than the other actors, who do seem a little too plump for the situation they're in.)",1430870400,,994,4.226315789473684
4324722,3,B004C45AZU,"Based on Slavomir Rawiczs book The Long Walk the film version The Way Back contains some notable differences, but includes essential themes nevertheless. The narrative mainly follows an escaped group of Polish, Russian and other prisoners deemed enemies of the U.S.S.R from an inhospitable Siberian prison camp during World War II. Surviving difficult terrain, crossing numerous countries, and impressive cinematography add value to the storyline. However, the isolated nature of the trek limits the potential of the plot. The characters do add some spark but ultimately the movie mildly succeeds more than it fails.

-from the scene at 1 hour and 50 minutes-

The walk from a gulag in Soviet Russia to freedom was not an easy one. It had to be in the cold and hunger of Siberia and the Himalayas, and in the heat and thirst of the Mongolian desert, let alone the despair and the loss of friends along the way. Only a few supporters that can hand water or lend a knife when needed, and only a few sparks of hope to light the ways. But the struggle paid its fruition in the end. It just required patience, endurance and perseverance.

The movie is less about politics and more about the human nature. However the backdrop of a political journey from totalitarian Russia to freedom was successfully executed and hemmed into the movie without falling into the trap of lecturing.

I cried with the last scene, while I had on a smile from ear to ear!
Very few movies can ignite such a mix of emotions.
A wonderful movie, about freedom, about human perseverance, and about finding ""the way back"" home.",1422316800,,1041,4.411458333333333

There is nothing easy about being free in one of the harshest regions of the world.  Food is hard to come by.  Frost, ice and snow are constant reminders of cold.  A vast emptiness embraces all comers.  In spite of it all, each member of the party tries they best to remain alive.

Sure, it is better than watching on an Iphone, but why watch a movie that is shot with care and quality on a system that has stutters, blurs, hitches, and various other problems, names of which I don't know.

The movie follows the book's story line loosely and credits the book's author.  It's entertaining but the near encounter with the Yeti in the Himalayas and other details that make the book more memorable were left out.  Many that watch the movie probably don't understand how far apart Siberia and India are.  The book conveyed the 4,000-mile walk vividly, with words, maps and lasting mind's-eye images.  While entertaining, the movie didn't.  I wonder why the producers titled the movie ""The Way Back"" instead of ""The Long Walk.""  Would I read the book again?  Yes, if I could find it in a bookstore I'd buy it.  Would I re-watch the movie?  Probably not.  Once was ok, but not twice.",1405296000,2,852,4.6066666666666665

This movie also shows how people can make good or bad choices while under harsh conditions. Compassion and Empathy or Selfishness and Apathy.

4324904,5,B004C45AZU,"Wow! What a breathtaking, deeply moving, enlightening and inspiring film!
I was not aware of this story, but, boy, if you need a story to give you lifelong inspiration when you think you've lost the will to keep on keeping on, this is it!
It's one of the best and most memorable films I've seen in many a year.
And let's not ignore the acting, of which you'll see examples of some of the finest performances in recent years - or ever. Kudos especially to Ed Harris and Colin Farrell.
I guess the only actor I wasn't totally thrilled with was Jim Sturgess - although, to be fair, he put in a good job. He just wasn't cast properly, for my money. I think his role demanded a more towering presence, one that projected more strength - and perhaps emotion - especially. But he was no slouch.
I was so impressed with this film that I felt I had to share it with my parents, so I bought I copy from Amazon for them to see. I have already emailed several friends, recommending it.
...Not quite Lawrence of Arabia, but it comes close, in my humble opinion. It's less lavish than Lawrence of Arabia and short on the big-budget glitz, but, then again, that's not needed or even appropriate to this story.

4324908,5,B004C45AZU,"This is a great movie.  The scenery, depiction of conditions, landscape, feelings and motivations of main characters are wonderfully done.  It's a sobering reminder of the harshness of conditions in gulags, the cruelty of communism, the hopelessness of those trapped in travesty of Soviet judicial system if you can call it that.  Selection of actors was superb and all of them did a great job portraying their roles and projecting the feelings of those travelers.  It's a great tribute to all those who haven't given up in whatever desperate conditions they might be in and pressed on to survive.  Human spirit triumphs over tragedy.

The one caution to the viewer.  The movie is allegedly based on a true story, or real events.  This can only be the story captured in the book ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" by Slavomir Rawicz.  The book isn't a true story, however gripping it may be.  While the movie follows the general story pretty well, there are some variations from the book.  Neither detracts from the movie itself and it's well worth watching, just be aware of the facts.",1401148800,,1104,4.757894736842105

4324923,4,B004C45AZU,"I really love the first half of this movie but the second half it the movie becomes a little tedious and I started to think this movie, which is great a great movie could have been really awesome if it was directed by a different director. Peter Wier is a great director but may be this isn't his greatest project. The movie is extremely chopping  and the actors dialogue seem incomplete-which is a real shame- all the actors did a great job. I still love this movie and I watch it ever blue moon;it is helpful reminder that the walking  to the end of the big box office store parking lot  is short in comparison to the distance of the 4,00 mile trek Januz and his companions walked.
 But if you really enjoyed the movie I suggest  you should read the book ""The Long Walk- a true Story  of a Trek to Freedom"" by  Slavomir Rawicz; needless to say the book is better then the movie.",1399852800,,880,4.265060240963855

If you want to watch a movie like people who love you would want you to watch rent The Budapest Hotel by Wes Anderson.  Movies like The Way Back are fantastic for social studies class, but why do people pay millions of dollars to see big names go through hours of predictable suffering, especially when they know how it's going to end.

This movie brings us back to the days when actors had to do the work. It is full of actors that play their characters incredibly well. There are some slow parts, but that's the point, and the director did an incredible job of putting us into the emotion of the situation so we remain invested. At the very beginning of the movie, we are told that ""three men"" walked out of the mountains into India, so right away we know there are going to be a number of deaths, and we are wondering who. At times, you may say, yeah that makes sense. At times, you may be surprised. At times, hopefully, you will be saddened.",1398988800,,777,4.440559440559441

The locations were perfect, as was the cinematography, and the costumer should also get five stars for the inventive and convincing clothes of these bedraggled refugees from the Gulag walking 4000 miles from Siberia to India.

4324953,5,B004C45AZU,"The treacherous geographical region between Siberia and India came alive in this movie as the characters fought the elements to make it back to freedom.  The group of men didn't know much about each other and weren't even sure if they could trust each other, but each had an intense determination to make it out alive. I especially like the way the characters revealed their personal stories to the young woman who became a traveling companion along the way.

4324961,5,B004C45AZU,"This movie doesn't have the usual cliched scenes with men having to kill their enemies to survive or defend the honor of a young girl. This is an honest interpretation of the story of a group of men who escaped from Russian prison in Siberia and traveled thousands of miles by foot to freedom--those who survived. They pick up a runaway girl on the way, a charming person who doesn't survive. There are other surprises. But the main thing they must survive is nature itself in all of its power. They must overcome freezing temperatures, hunger, lack of water. There is an interesting speed-up of time in the last couple of minutes of the movie that bring the main character (not the American prisoner played by Ed Harris) home to his wife after the collapse of communism.

It's too bad this film didn't fare better at the box office. But there were no car chases, obscenity, and sex scenes, so it had a lot stacked against it. Well worth your time if you like quality informed by actual history.",1398470400,,995,4.558659217877095
4324962,4,B004C45AZU,"A great movie loosely based on history.  The sets and costuming was highly detailed with an eye for accuracy. All of the characters played their parts well, but three stood out to me.

Jim Sturgess, as ""Janusz"", played the main character very well and his positive and relentless spirit, triumphed to the end of the film.

Colin Farrell, as ""Valka"",  did a wonderful job as well. Starting out as ruthless and unpredictable but gradually becoming a better person with feelings. Slightly ""off"", but like able.

Lastly, Ed Harris performed the part of ""Mr. Smith"". He too, as with Valka, slowly shed the hard, gritty prison survival mentality, and became human again. I think this is one of his best performances.

In all, a great movie with a good story line.",1398470400,,757,4.7846153846153845

4324964,5,B004C45AZU,"Loved this movie. One can sympathize with the characters given the Russian brutality of its Siberian camps. Makes one wonder why the USA ever desired to have a relationship with Russia during WWII. As my father, a career officer who fought in WWII said, we should have enlisted the Germans on our side and fought the Russians.

True stories are truly the best stories, but the images of sketched women in the nude I thought were really unnecessary to convey the hearts of the men held in that horrible prison camp.

Those that own home theatre systems, or are not timid about turning the volume up would probably rate it as a truly great movie. Heavy accents and whispered dialogue do not for a great (or even good) movie make.

From the midway point to the end it was a little easier to understand, but from the beginning to that point the temptation to shut it off was pretty powerful. When all was said and done I'm glad I tolerated it, but I'm sure I won't watch it again.",1396828800,,542,4.211538461538462

4325006,4,B004C45AZU,"Allegedly based on real events (later disputed by BBC) this is an adventures across Asia, cultures and languages. It is entertaining, but not much more than that. Since the very first frame the viewer knows exactly who is going to survive and live on, and who dies in the adventure. The one thing that I like a lot about this movie is the photography, really well done. The story sometimes is trite, but, hey, watch it as an entertainment and nothing more. Even if true that according to a later BBC's investigation the book on which this movie is based is totally made up, that was a well done and imagined story.",1396656000,,614,4.491071428571429

4325017,2,B004C45AZU,"Perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for it, but I found The Way Back depressing and hard to watch.  Yeah, you'd expect that a movie about prisoners in a gulag might be that way, and I was hoping it would start to break out a bit, but about halfway through, with them lolling around the lake while one guy nearly dies scouting a new path, I just packed it in.",1396396800,,356,4.014084507042254

4325021,3,B004C45AZU,"The beginning made me feel as if I was in a Siberian prison camp. Ed Harris and others are very believable but after the escapees hit the Gobi desert, reality is challanged. None of them could survive a real desert trek and the challange of getting from Lhasa,Tibet to India is completely ignored.

Still, the acting was good and it was worth watching on a snowy Saturday night.",1396310400,,378,4.5588235294117645

Hard to believe this was based on an actual event, particularly when the performances were taking the performers through the freezing tundra of Siberia and the deserts of Asia. How much of it was dramatized is unknown to this writer, but it made for an interesting and entertaining movie. The only drawback to the movie was any scene shot within the gulag was very dark and difficult to see. Other than that a good movie that was well  paced.",1396224000,,497,4.6477272727272725

4325025,5,B004C45AZU,"Speaking solely as an aficionado of movies as an art form and actors as humanity in caricature, Ed Harris again shows us how it is done. I lack the words and the understanding to explain his genius but if this man is not a genius then genius does not exist. He can say more in an imperceptible twitch of an eyelid than most wannabe geniuses could say in a Russian novel.

Speaking as a man who appreciates sacrifice in the name of humanity, aka freedom, I don't know how this could have been done better. But I do know it could have been done better. I think I know what they were trying to do and, better than that, I think I felt what they were trying to make me feel. In a surreality-show world where everything, except soap opera relationship issues, must be resolved in an hour or less, the problem tackled by this film is how to make people who inherited freedom understand that freedom is worth more than what they paid for it. Unfortunately, it misses the mark - not by failing to show the harsh realities that face the unwary but by failing to properly explain to people who have had their freedom handed to them on a silver platter why they should be willing to pay in something more than mere inconvenience. Yawn. It is so not fun to watch people cross a desert. People will never know the value of anything, much less freedom, until they have lost it and paid full price to buy it back. But this is a movie that came closer to helping people appreciate the price than any I have ever seen - that is why I gave it five stars.",1396051200,,1536,4.260273972602739

4325027,5,B004C45AZU,"The Way Back is a brilliantly executed portrayal of a true story.  It powerfully captures the horror of the Soviet police state, the frozen hell of Siberian work camps, and the against-all-odds struggle against nature of those who dared to escape and live.  The movie is a journey through the expanse and majesty of nature that will leave the viewer in awe, both of nature's power, and the endurance of the men who resist it.

The film, framed in a story of betrayal, enduring love, and forgiveness, has a gravity and beauty that make it a gem.",1396051200,,544,4.587628865979381

It is about the human spirit moving forward when it must and knowing when to quit and leave the fight to others. It shows how all of the characters had great stamina and a humongous will to survive, and how not all of them had the same strength to go on. Some made it to the finish line, but not all.

It resists the temptation to glory in the horror of what these people (and many, many others) went through to try to escape the horrors of communism. It serves as another reminder, and we need them constantly, of the sheer evil of communism - something western academics to this day try to gloss over. And most importantly it reminds us of the occasions when the spirit of man somehow finds a way to triumph over absolute evil.

4325119,5,B004C45AZU,"Peter Weirs film, The Way Back, inspired by Slawomir Rawiczs book The Long Walk, tells the story of a group of prisoners 1941 escape from a Russian gulag camp in Siberia and their subsequent trek across the Asian continent to freedom in India. A careful study by people involved in the film project provides evidence that Rawicz could not have participated in all of the stages of the flight described in his book. At the time when Rawicz  claimed to have been wandering across Asias wilderness, he was actually stationed with the Polish Army in the Middle East.  He left Russia the same way as thousands of other Poles following an August 12, 1941 Soviet declared amnesty. Since these facts emerged several years after his death, Rawicz had no opportunity to respond to the allegations. Archival studies have produced surprising results indicating that Rawicz actually incorporated stories of other escapees who found themselves in similar circumstances but in places other than those described by the author. During the film production, another Siberian exile living in the UK, Witold Glinski, presented his theory that it was actually he who had participated in the march and that Rawicz somehow had got hold of his story that had been filed with the Polish government during the war. Establishing the truth seventy years after the alleged events is a difficult process and leaves many questions unanswered.

The Long Walk According To Rawicz
If Rawicz didn't walk across Asia, he still could have blended his own personal experiences in the first few chapters. The descriptions of life in the gulag and of brutal interrogation in Moscows Lubyanka prison were his own. Inaccuracies appear later on in the book, such as in the descriptions of landscapes, climate, and the customs of the inhabitants of Mongolia and Tibet.
After being sentenced for espionage,  Rawicz  was transported to Siberia. Along with dozens of other inmates, he was forced to walk 800 kilometers through the snow east from Irkutsk in weather of  -65 degrees Celsius. The reality of life in the camp made him aware that his sentence of 25 years of compulsory labor would mean certain death. The thought of escape was born on the first day.
After the 1941 amnesty, his return route to freedom took him across the same area, which he earlier had passed as a prisoner. Besides the walk to the rail station 800 kilometers away, he had to travel another 2,000 kilometers from Irkutsk to Novosibirsk and additional 1,500 kilometers to the gathering point for all released Poles. His own journey, though significant, was still 2,000 kilometers less than what was depicted in The Long Walk.
After the war, Rawicz settled in the UK, in close proximity to Nottingham, and married a librarian, Marjorie Gregory. Learning English wasn't the easiest task. He spoke with a heavy accent and had a limited vocabulary.
The meeting between Rawicz and a journalist, Ronald Charles Downing, who later wrote down the story, occurred in 1954. Downing worked for The Daily Mail,  a newspaper looking for sensational stories. After the conquest of Mount Everest by Edmund Hillary in 1953, the popular press was preoccupied with pursuing the trail of the yeti allegedly photographed in the Himalayas two years earlier. The newspaper sponsored an expedition to search for more evidence.  Journalists searched for witnesses in the UK who might have some knowledge of yetis. In January, 1954 the Daily Mail published an article describing his encounter with this strange Himalayan creature. After this publication, Downing decided to take his exploration farther. The presence of a Pole in the Himalayas was surely an intriguing subject. In the early stages of writing, Downing had difficulties recreating Rawiczs past.  A psychologist treating Rawicz for post-war trauma advised him to view their conversations as a form of therapy to reconcile with the past. Downing commuted from London and showed up once a month, on Sundays. Contrary to their earlier commitments, the hosts did not always welcome him at their home. Sometimes the journalist found the door closed tight, which he attributed to Rawiczs depression. Once they did meet, the conversation went on for hours until the last evening train to London. Marjorie frequently took matters in her own hands injecting her own opinion when her husband ran out of words. Downing presented his edited notes from the previous meeting, sometimes used his own imagination without consulting the couple. For example, when The Long Walks statement about survival on the Gobi desert without water for two weeks met with suspicion, Rawicz blamed the journalist for inventing it. Nevertheless, he never demanded amendments to any inaccuracies in later editions of the book. Downing died at the young age of 50. No notes associated with his articles or conversations with Rawicz were left behind.

Bombay
In the early years of WWII, the Polish Consulate in Bombay processed numerous Poles with astounding stories. Three men in their twenties, fugitives from German POW camps (sic!) showed up at the door in July 1940.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London asked how many like them were registered, and where they had come from. Consul Banasinski addressed a request for additional subsidies for soldiers and officers escaping from the Soviet camps who came in 1941 ragged, poor, without any means of support.  To relieve the consulates financial burden from supporting them, the Consul created a local Draft Board to send the youths to the Polish military units in the Middle East as soon as possible (Hoover Institution Archives. Poland. Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych).  In one of these groups was Bronislaw Boguszewicz.

Boguszewicz
Bronislaw Boguszewicz had been arrested by the NKVD in Vilnius in 1940. Sent to the Kozielsk camp, he escaped with a colleague, a Polish Jew named Jozef Bakermann, after being informed about the mass executions of Polish officers. (HIA. Poland. MSZ) They chose to head south east and reached the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. From there they went to Baku and crossed the Caspian Sea to Turkmenistan. They were captured at the border with Iran where they met in prison two other Poles Stolyhwo and Backer who travelled with a beautiful Russian girl Tatyana Tschynnova who was their liaison with the Russian population. Before releasing them and supplying with maps Iranians added another prisoner of Ukrainian-Polish origin Ivan Basylevski. All five, without the girl who was suspected of espionage, walked for thousand kilometers towards Khyber Pass and eventually reached Bombay (British Library Archives). The estimated distance of their escape was between 3.5 to 4 thousand kilometers. After recuperation in the hospital Boguszewicz was moved between a refugee and an internment camp in a proximity to the Himalayan Mountains. He met in India a fellow by the name of Zdenek Szaro.  Boguszewiczs wife, Regina, heard the name from her husband in the 1940s, long before the publication of The Long Walk. According to what she remembered, Szaro had escaped from the camp across the Himalayas to India in the first months of 1942 along with a group of Poles. His name with a similar spelling  Zaro appears in The Long Walk.  As mentioned in a personal conversation, Boguszewiczs son Henry discovered Rawiczs book in 1980, showed it to his father, who confirmed that he had met the same Siberian refugees in India. Since Boguszewicz senior spoke many languages,  [5] British intelligence officers asked him to translate during meetings with the escapees.
Regina added one more fact from her husbands biography. Before 1939, he had served as an officer in the motorized units of the Polish army and was an experienced radio operator. He had an education in engineering and probably worked in a telecommunication factory in Vilnius. His skills were used in the camp in Siberia where he repaired radio equipment. The camp commanders wife identified him as a distant relative, and warned him of impending executions of Polish officers and helped him to escape. Both Rawicz and Glinski indicated in their stories that they received some assistance from a woman with a similar background. After the war Boguszewiczs family travelled for months from India to England meeting along the way thousands of Polish refugees. Eventually they resettled to New Zealand where Regina died in January 2013.

Piwowarski
The consulate in Bombay received another group consisting of four men in March, 1942 (HIA. Poland Op.cit. )  One of them was Zdzislaw Piwowarski, who had been captured by the NKVD in 1939 while trying to cross the Polish border into Romania. From a camp in the Ural Mountains, he was sent to another in Kazakhstan where he worked in the construction of canals on Lake Aral. With a few colleagues, he escaped from there through Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. After crossing the border with Afghanistan, a country particularly sensitive about Soviet espionage, they were imprisoned for four months. The Bombay Consulate reports indicate that once they were transferred to India, the escapees health required weeks of hospitalization. They had walked for 2.5-3 thousand kilometers through the desert and mountains. At the time Piwowarski was 21 years old. Via the Middle East, he was sent to England, where he served in the Polish Air Force and earned many awards. After the war he settled in Nottingham, and lived not far from Rawicz.
Piwowarskis grandson Ron mentioned in our personal correspondence, that Zdzislaw tried to get his story published but was told it was too factual and needed more emotion. It was typed in many copies by his wife and most likely seen and talked about by many in the Polish community in the North of England. Ron found many parallels to grandfathers story in The Long Walk. As he wrote: After all, at least 3 to 4 people (ZS: with similar experience) made it to the UK. It would have been fairly easy for someone to gather the stories together, add in some extra adventures and then publish them.  In his typescript Piwowarski talks a lot about his time in Lwows military academy. His fitness gave him an edge, he was a keen sportsman, and a great fencer and skier. He details every location throughout the whole journey and describes his exhaustion by the time when he got to India.

Michal Krupa
Memoirs published over the last twenty years provide us with additional information about other escapees who reached the Indian Peninsula. One of them is Michal Krupa, a former Jesuit seminarian and cavalry regiment soldier was captured by the Soviets in late 1939. From that point on his story sounds like many others. Accused of spying and interrogated in the Lubyanka, he was deported to Pechora 400 kilometers from Vorkuta, a region known for its harsh weather conditions. After months of preparation, he managed to escape. From the Arctic ice region, he walked south 6,000 kilometers until he reached Afghanistan. The endless and merciless wilderness of nature was only part of the difficulty. Siberia, without counting gulag victims, had some of the worst statistics of murders in the world. Published for the first time in 1995 under the title Shallow Graves in Siberia, Krupas memoirs are a horrifying testimony of Stalinist era crimes. Author died in West Yorkshire in 2013.

Nineteenth century escapes
It may take another decade or two before we gain access to the records of the organizations responsible for running the Soviet camps and before we are able learn more about the real fate of some prisoners. The history of earlier Siberian exiles has been fully explored by historians studying the nineteenth century Tsarist secret police archives. They are a prelude to the real tragedy of victims who experienced communism.
Some stronger men in their twenties and thirties managed to get away and were able to cross long distances, survive cold, lack of food, shelter, and the hostile environment. It is difficult to determine what percentage of Tsarist era prisoners reached a safe destination and how many perished.  In the western part of Russia, prisoners mixed with the crowds on country roads, and stayed close to villages where they could obtain food. In the eastern parts, China was the most obvious destination, though some headed towards Afghanistan and India, countries which offered contacts with European diplomatic services. Englishman Thomas Atkinson described in his book Oriental and Western Siberia, published in 1858,  the case of three Polish officers, participants of the November, 1830 Uprising, who escaped from Nerchinsk, and then journeyed a few thousand kilometers across Siberia. When they reached the Okhotsk Sea they boarded a ship to America.
Escape from a country without a developed road network and without a telegraph network was much easier. Luck of roads, signage, maps led to many tragedies with prisoners who after sentencing convoyed by the guards got lost in the woods. No one knew how to deliver them to the place they got sentenced to. Walking routes from Warsaw to a particular destination in Siberia sometimes took from 1 to 1.5 years. Many died on the road.
One 1830 uprising insurgent, Rufin Piotrowski,  was deported thousands of miles to Omsk, but escaped by pretending to be a bearded Russian peasant wearing a wig made out of goat hair. He left in February, 1846 when the temperature dropped to minus 50 degrees Celsius and headed north toward Arkhangelsk as a pilgrim visiting local churches. In the winter, he slept in snow dugouts; in the summer in the open fields. In his memoirs My Escape from Siberia published in 1863, he complained about banditry and murders committed on rural roads by homeless vagabonds. When he finally found freedom in the west, 6,000 kilometers from his starting point, many doubted his story. After collecting testimonies from witnesses, he wrote a book, which when translated to many languages received attention comparable to The Long Walk.

Mister Smith
Among his travel companions, Rawicz mentions an American by the name of Mr. Smith who after the groups arrival in Calcutta was supposed to look for help from his countrymen. In the book, he is described as mysterious man of few words, with some military experience, and speaking excellent Russian.
If he really existed, what was doing in the USSR, and why did he end up in the camp?
Author Linda Willis devoted 10 years of research to identify Smith, which she published in Looking for Mr. Smith. A Quest for the Truth Behind The Long Walk the Greatest Survival Story Ever Told. She claims to have found records confirming his existence even though he hid under many false identities.
According to Willis, Smith traveled to the Soviet Union during the Great Depression when Moscow recruited international specialists to assist in the implementation of industrial plans. In the 1930s, thousands of mostly young communists and trade unionists showed up seeking employment. Many who decided to accept Soviet citizenship had their U.S. documents taken away. After disillusionment when the Soviet reality set in, they turned back to the American Embassy for help. The U.S. diplomatic service was glad to get rid of the communists and showed no interest in their fate. A lack of passports was an additional excuse. Hundreds if not thousands of were sentenced to the gulag.
On Willis account, Smith had good reason to speak the Russian language like a native. He was born in 1890 in the vicinity of Saratov on the Volga River. His real name was Abdul Chumjlakef which he changed later to Shumgalakov/Szumgalakoff. He departed Russia unexpectedly in 1913, perhaps as a deserter from the army or following some violent incident. He received U.S. citizenship in 1926 and changed his name to the easier to pronounce Smith and returned to Saratov working as a supplier of tools to Moscow factories. In 1938, after the NKVD suspended the activities of most American business organizations, Smith approached the U.S. Embassy for a new passport but never appeared to pick it up. Most likely he had been accused of spying, and vanished into the prison system. Documents describing his physical appearance mention a scar on his face and neck.  Linda Willis who made this discovery asked Rawicz whether he had noticed anything special about Smiths appearance. He pointed out the scar. Since none of this was mentioned in The Long Walk it was clear that he had met Smith in person. Keith Clarke who wrote the script of The Way Back asked Rawicz, two years before his death, about Smiths age at the time of escape and received response: Fifty one. Linda Willis research reveals that this was Smiths correct age at that time. (Looking for Mr. Smith, p. 258)

Ruppert Mayne
As an officer serving in British Intelligence in Calcutta during the Second World War, Ruppert Mayne left a testimony about a meeting with three men who claimed to have escaped from Siberia and who had reached India in 1942 by crossing the Himalayas.  Maynes son provided details in conversation with BBC reporter Hugh Levinson about that. Responsible for security in a region full of axis agents, Mayne identified himself in the last chapter  of The Long Walk as being the British interrogator. They were in a pitiable state, utterly exhausted, and close to death.  He didn't remember their names since they sounded very foreign.

Glinski
How does one explain sudden appearance of Glinski claiming that Rawicz stole his story? In what circumstances could this have happened? Before his death in April 2013 he was willing to provide amplification on every missing detail and answer every question.
Friends of Rawicz who were close to him during the war were surprised when the book was published in 1956.  None of them knew about his journey to India.  Glinski also remained silent. Until recently, no family member was aware of his past. Glinski and Rawicz never met or never heard of each other but they both claimed to know the same people. Could that be the key to the mystery?
Years after the books publication, the Rawicz couple stated in a rather enigmatic way that they were unable to fully convey the whole truth about the escape. Rawicz claimed that he brought it to light out of a moral commitment, not material gain. Was he trying to say that he did it on behalf of others still hiding their identities?

Long Road to Freedom
In August 1941,under foreign pressure, Stalin agreed to declare amnesty for the Polish prisoners in the gulag. Hundreds of thousands of people began to move southward in the fall and winter of 1941-1942, many from very remote areas like Magadan located 6,000 kilometers from Moscow. They traveled on foot, rafts, boats, ships, and freight or passenger trains. They crossed mountain ranges, rivers, and forests in severe winter climate.  It took between weeks to months to travel in the transportation chaos caused by the war. Women, men and children roamed about the country, homeless, exhausted, completely destitute, and starved. Mortality was very high. Their journey was the period of the greatest torment. To add to the hardship, one must include the worries about the fate of their families.
Some had left without authorization, by escaping and boarding trains as stowaways, avoiding military police, and doing anything in order to get food and survive.  Those who left were only a fraction of the total number of survivors who were liberated after the amnesty.
Poles were the first ones ever to bring eye-witness reports about the Siberian concentration camps to the world. An analysis of their testimonies filed with a special Document Unit of the General Anders Polish Corps in the Middle East has allowed a clear picture about the scale of atrocities to emerge (HIA, Anders Collection). They were asked to write down their experiences and fill out questionnaires, and reports on conditions of their confinement. Facts collected by Poles at that time (1942-1945) were very inconvenient to the British and American governments who were eager to suppress evidence to justify their alliance with Stalin. Disclosing them even ten years after the war was too embarrassing. It didn't fit the war time propaganda scheme.
My own extensive research at the Hoover Institution Archives into these records supports the conclusion that the reality of the gulag was much worse than has often been depicted in other historical sources and literature. The environment created by the soviet oppressors imposed the most terrible and arbitrary rules upon the prisoners in the gulag system.
According to psychologists who dealt with World War Two veterans, as many as one third of them had amnesia of the war events, a condition which is often overlooked in civilian life. Half of them tried to suppress traumatic memories or had large gaps in their memories of the past.  Many avoided thoughts associated with their exposure to torture, assault and atrocities. Intense fear, helplessness, and horror compounded by life under the regular threat of death left them as damaged humans. Ronald C. Downing who wrote down Rawiczs story couldn't have comprehended that reality.
There are lost episodes in our collective memory caused by the fear of reprisals. The Long Walk was written at the peak of the cold war. Former prisoners left families behind the Iron Curtain to fates unknown and speaking in public surely would have put relatives in the East in jeopardy. A concern for their safety prevented those who had escaped to the West from sharing the complete picture. Frequently their experiences in the gulag were deliberately disguised. Many changed their own identities or the identities of people they talked about. That is another truth which has complicated the research over the years.
Rawiczs road to freedom was long and impeded by many obstacles. He must have met thousands after his release, during the evacuation, in the Middle East, and  in the resettlement centers in England. Faces, names, places merged into one shared story. He didn't have to invent much, for his experiences were similar to that of many others. He spoke on behalf of a group, including those who perished. Many like him immigrated and lived in a tightly closed community in England. He undoubtedly had firsthand knowledge of the accounts of their life experiences and incorporated many of these different strands into his book.
The suffering inflicted on those who fell victim to the Stalinist ordeal was something that continues to elude the comprehension of both the contemporaries of that era and later generations. Our current level of understanding has been shaped by the secrecy of the Soviet state and the unavailability of archival materials deposited by the Soviet state security organizations, and which are still closed to general studies. Many questions will remain open until scholars get access to them.
The Long Walk  is mostly the truth, but the truth of many people and different  roads they have taken.

Peter Weir
Peter Weir was aware of the difficulties in determining the true story and sequence of events. In preparation for the film, he studied dozens of books, and became familiar with hundreds of documents, which composed a picture of the Siberian gulag. He took upon himself the responsibility to tell a story about something much bigger than the fate of a group of escapees capable of deeds that contradicted logic. This film talks about the will to preserve the dignity of man and the desire to live in freedom. The director did not doubt that these are the most important human qualities.

Michal Krupas poem:
Freedom, wonderful freedom,
How precious you are,
Only those will know who have lost you,
Millions are dying for you all over the world,
Only the lucky ones have you and hold you,
Life without you is empty as a shell,
and is no better than enduring in hell.

4325201,4,B004C45AZU,"With all the exceptional reviews written, why add another? This was added to my 'watch list' months ago and somehow it was missed. The storyline may have doubtful origins but the cast and cinematography add an interesting dimension to human nature. Definitely recommended from the first scene to the last . . . a beginning with an ending and all that is in between. Follow 'The Way Back!'

Just in case you don't get past those first subtitles, the majority of the dialogue is in English!",1392681600,,488,4.674418604651163

4325206,2,B004C45AZU,"Interesting idea, these are certainly inspiring stories, but rarely make for a good movie. After all, the director is telling the story of a few guys that escaped a Siberian gulag during WWII and walked all the way to India. I have seen different adaptations of this story, and they are all about the same. The team starts off distrustful of each other, a few die along the way, they encounter severe environmental challenges, and eventually a few make it. The problem, of course, is the entire story is them ""walking."" The movie never really becomes interesting either from a character standpoint or a story standpoint.",1392681600,,620,4.8584905660377355

Once they were in the camp and started speaking English I became involved with this incredible story.  The conditions under which they survived were unbelievable.

4325232,3,B004C45AZU,"Based on a true story, the plot of this movie is one familiar to us all.  It is well-acted with brutally realistic weather scenes.  However, since the movie is (almost) all outdoors, the production values are bad.  Couple that with thick Russian/Slavic accents and you'd better have your pause/back button ready.  The beginning has a lot of subtitles -- personally I have a 'thing' about subtitles; they are just needless.  So that also takes away from an otherwise good movie.  The human spirit is strong and if you want a movie to reaffirm that, this one will do it.  Check it out; just do it in the summer when you are warm.",1392422400,,627,4.544642857142857

It is only sad that all that started the journey could not complete it and also unfortunate that so much had to be omitted in order to fit the time frame.  You will enjoy this story if you enjoy danger and daring adventure movies and keep in mind that this really happened it did not come out of the mind of an author with a vivid imagination.,1392422400,,483,4.063157894736842

I never was bored by the 'slow' stretches, you are given a little of the 'feel' of the suffering involved but the movie was paced and edited brilliantly. the characters and acting are as good as it gets.

I suppose the most striking aspect of this movie is the portrayal of character, courage, determination and forgiveness under most trying circumstances.  I would recommend this movie for those who are tired of cartoon character movies which feature the same carbon copy heroes embellished by ultra special effects (how many times can one see someone hanging on to a chopper in mid air or some female heroine using her superior physical fighting skills to lay out about 9 different muscle bound guys).",1392249600,,623,4.8584905660377355

Great cinematography, the scenery was breathtaking, the people closeups gave you a true sense of what they were experiencing and the hunger they had to be free.
It's a must see film that  will leave you thankful for the easy life we have, and hopefully thinking/praying for those who are still in the throes of evil/",1392163200,,528,4.617021276595745

Great story telling. Seeing how different walks of life work together to achieve the impossible is an impressive feat. The highs and lows of their struggle across blizzards and desert storms is a testament to the human spirit. Each character drew strength from each other despite their different motivations and personas.

I knocked it a star simply because it felt ""rushed"" at times, as in it felt as if they cut scenes to push the movie along. I guess that's the nature of the cinematography. Overall, great movie. Enjoy and be moved.",1391904000,,571,4.876288659793815

It seemed like a wonderful story, but because the sound was so bad and I'm sure I missed much of the story, I gave it only 2 stars.

4325292,3,B004C45AZU,"Not very much on the way of great acting, a long journey that sometimes looses its emotional connection. One moment they are in Siberia, the next moment they are walking thousands of miles. Performances are just okay, no awards for this one. It seemed to last a long time and there was not a lot of excitement in the journey, besides the inclement weather they seemed to manage well enough. Video was nice, sound a little muffled. 3 Stars.",1391731200,,439,4.569620253164557

4325305,4,B004C45AZU,"While the story was unknown to us, it was a riveting encounter of the desperation required to survive the evils of war. With only one known actor, Ed Harris, we found the acting to be very good and the characters very believable. We thought it to be an excellent movie to view on a cold, snowy evening. The weather also helped you get some feel for their environment during their trek. It's almost unbelievable that they could have traveled that far and crossed the Himalayas. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1391558400,,516,4.619565217391305
4325306,4,B004C45AZU,Although it was a sad story it showed the human strength and spirit. Hard to imagine enduring the horrific struggles they went through and the sadness of loss. The ability to have people from such adverse backgrounds come together with one common human goal...to live and be free was very moving. The cruelty one human could inflict on another was sad.,1391558400,,352,4.786885245901639

4325328,5,B004C45AZU,"This movie was worth waiting twice in this last year, a survival story one should n ever forget. Why, these things happen again and again, j uhh st the time, countries and people change,the hate is the same basically. I love seeing the human spirit challenged and come out winning . From trouble to trouble, persecution to persecution, The fight or flight is the same. It was a hard way to go for these men that some seemed to lose their kindness and caring realize they had not lost them but only hid them a while. The trek was a f trek that would kill  some of them but desires to be free is stronger than fear of death. Excellent and don't want to give any away at all. It is an Amazon prime movie and it makes it even better to watch a high caliber movie for free,",1391299200,,768,4.154362416107382

4325336,5,B004C45AZU,"I watched this through a steaming company (won't put the name here) but I will be buying the DVD to add to my extensive collection.

The movie is not for everyone, there are no car chases, no explosions, and no nudity. If you aren't a thinker and have to be constantly entertained then it may not be for you.

However, if you enjoy a great script, fantastic acting, and a compelling story of human courage and survival then you'll like The Way Back.

It reminded me of Seven Years in Tibet, both in the subject matter and in its execution. The scenery includes areas that are supposed to be Siberia in the winter, the Gobi Desert, the Himalayas, and everywhere in between.

The movie is slow paced throughout most of it but that is intentional and works well with the subject matter of these people trudging their way from the political prison in Siberia across thousands of miles of mostly inhospitable territory.

If you like great films you have to watch this one!",1391212800,,967,4.566473988439307

the acting was superb.  the actors were well selected.  the plot line was accurate to the point of accuracy of what they experienced.  the scenes which included animals were kept to a minimum.  something of which i highly appreciate.
what these people went through, what they survived was nothing short of spectacular.  fell off my chair about the 'passport' statement.  a movie which will stay in my mind for a long time to come.  it was well done and the fact that it was based on a true story makes it all the more fantastic.

The producers had to cram a whole lot of calendar time and a whole lot of miles and climate changes into a two-hour time slot. Given those limitations, they did a good job.

A true story of 7 people traveling together over 4,500 miles, fighting against nature, over Mountains, through Deserts & at times each other? This film captured amazing acting performances & with equally inspiring Cinematography!

No drama, no excitement, nothing interesting, the sets were poor, the soundtrack was mostly non-existant. The plot was also terrible.

This is a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG movie. . .  ..This is a SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW movie.

One of the worst parts is that they didn't show what happened to the characters after the end of the movie.  Being that this is based upon a true story.  .. . .Being that this happened back in 1940. . . .

4325388,2,B004C45AZU,"Interesting story, but is it true? Don't think so. The story line is flawed from the time the ""heroes"" escape the Siberian gulag and head into the woods--into a blizzard of 20 below zero. They survive somehow on the food they had saved prior to the escape--for how long? We are not given days, weeks or months since the escape--or a map to show their route as the story unfolds. Their hair, facial hair, clothing remain amazingly fresh considering the harrowing conditions. It would have been nice to know how long they were in the Siberian wilderness before finding the Black Sea and sparse civilization. Spending an inordinate time with a mosquito infestation instead of how they hunkered down each night to survive. Picking up a displaced Polish girl escapee along the way, who manages to hang with the men for a 1000 miles or so--through much of the harsh desert before dying. The desert scenes were unimpressive where most scenes were filmed in panoramic scenes.  By the time they emerge in India, having crossed the Himalayans, mind you, they are remarkably fit for having eaten little of complete nutrition. Really? 4,000 miles on foot across the most challenging wilderness on earth--Siberia, the Gobi desert, the Himalayan mountains. Good performance by Ed Harris, competent acting by the others. Only redeeming quality--beautiful scenery, but even that is not enough to make up for a story that lacks authenticity.",1390435200,,1424,5.008438818565401

This film starts with the brutal conditions of the Russian Gulag, a small group that decides to risk escaping under brutal weather conditions, and their fight to survive in the winter.  This movie gave me more than I expected since the actors were also excellent.  Characters were rounded out so you got a good feeling for who they were by how they treated each other.  The scenery, with its wicked snowstorms, attempts to find shelter, and coming of spring as the group tries to find its way to a lake they know exists that will lead them out of the country, is absolutely stunning.  I highly recommend this film.",1390435200,,803,4.7898550724637685

As the story unfolded, the unbelievable harshness seemed to grow in intensity and I found myself constantly asking the question, ""Could I have made it this far?"". In the end, it was a good lesson in reminding today's humanity on just how soft we have become. The cast was superb with performances that should be recognized for some kind of award.

However, the inhumanity inflicted upon all of the prisoners is sickening.  I hope we will learn one day not to hurt one another.
Superb performances by Ed Harris & surprisingly, Colin Farrell who is really convincing in his role.  I didn't realize what a great actor Colin is as most of his prior films did not give him the opportunity to use the acting skills he so clearly has.

If film can change a viewer's life, this one fits that description.  Ed Harris is powerful as the American, ""Mr.,"" and the young Polish lead actor is masterful as the example of what it means to forgive.  This is a long film.  You will be tired at the finish, but intellectually and emotionally renewed.  You will think about it for days; new insights will come to your consciousness, and you will marvel that you could have been so ""riveted"" to a story that has no special effects, no monsters, and simply follows the relationship development of a small group of people on a several thousand mile hike from Siberia to India.

I would have given it 5 stars if it had not been for the glitch in watching.  Not sure why the delivery stopped?  The next sitting the movie resumed where it had stopped the previous time and I was able to watch till the end.

The way back is an amazing story of survival against all odds, not everyone was able to survive through all the depravations the group encountered on their way to freedom.

The severe landscapes that stand in for Siberia, Mongolia and Tibet are beautifully filmed.  As other reviewers have mentioned, Weir does not shy away from the brutal conditions of the Soviet Gulag, or the harsh reality of the desperate journey of the escapees.  Death,suffering and deprivation are ever-present, making the occasional small moments of comic relief and human compassion all the more striking. I thought all the actors did well by their characters. Colin Farrell was particularly good as a jumpy Russian criminal, and Saoirise Ronan was heartbreaking as a young girl the men pick up along the journey.",1390089600,,718,5.119658119658119

Now in all seriousness it was not a bad movie, hence the 3 ""it's okay"" stars, but I would go 2.5 if I could. It felt like it dragged on and on, by the third time they were in this vicious dying from no food/water cycles I was ready to turn it off. Much like those walking through the desert I did suffer through to the end and it wasn't so bad, but a bit anti-climatic.

They walked thousands of miles through the world's harshest terrains.  The story itself is incredible.

Too often today movies have their characters unrealistically survive impossible encounters (one person takes out ten highly trained enemies; right; I'll bet he's wearing underwear with a big red S on it).  This is not the case with The Way Back.  From the beginning, the escapees suffer real injury, sickness, and results of trying to survive in a very hostile wild, with more than half of them dying along the way. (This shouldn't be a spoiler since the storyline says 3 men walk into India when 7 escape and they pick up another person along the way.)

4325493,4,B004C45AZU,Fabulous movie about survival and man's will to live.  It was a well done move and being based on a true story makes it that much more intense.  People of different countries and backgrounds worked together to escape a communist death camp.  The story is centered on a man's fight to return back to his wife.  She is tortured and forced to confess things her husband didn't do which leads to him being thrown in prison as an enemy of the state.

It was emotional and at times tragic, but the movie moves along and makes it points known in a way that you want to keep watching.
The movie deals with how men deal with freedom and longing for it and what lengths he will go for it.  It, also, deals with man's willingness to be slaves and captives and what lengths he will go in order to compensate himself for it.  Very much deals with symbolism in the movie pertaining to these themes, but it won't be loss on the average viewer if he/she understands what the characters are doing.

4325542,1,B004C45AZU,"I cannot recommend this movie. It was not believable, boring, slow plot and the use of the actors accents was not worth the effort put into the story lines. Don't waste your time it's not worth the free rent.",1389052800,,208,4.358974358974359
4325543,4,B004C45AZU,"""The Way Back"" has almost nothing new to tell us. The story of seven prisoners who escape a Siberian labor camp and walk halfway across the world to freedom doesn't reinvent the jailbreak; the characters are tried and true, and a lot of the action is predictable. But somehow the film overcomes its shortcomings and gives us a very watchable and entertaining piece of work.

Our somewhat Magnificent Seven represent the gamut of usual suspects: we have a Noble Leader, a joker, a man of mystery, an artist...you know the drill. The best performances are turned in by Colin Farrell as a wily Russian crook, and Ed Harris, a disgrunted American who thought Russia would be an escape from the Depression and a worker Utopia. The rest of the cast is made up of European actors and they handle their roles very well.

Seven comrades set on an epic journey, slogging by foot through Russia, across the Gobi Desert, over the Himalays and all the way to India before they find sanctuary. David Weir, the director, provides us with exceptional camera work. No stock shots here, we see the terrain the men have to cross, and it's a frightening, powerful experience. Every time the survivors get past another obstacle, you feel like cheering.  Weir also keeps a tight rein on the performers. No one goes over the top, although you can see how nuch Colin Farrell wants to.

Even more interesting than the film, is the story behind it. ""The Way Back"" is based on ""The Long Walk"" by Slavomir Rawicz, a Polish army officer. His memoir of an 11-month trek from Irkutsk to India is a paen to man's strength, determination and love of freedom. And it's a crock. Rawicz eventually admitted he made up the whole escape thing. He got his walking papers in 1942 during a general amnesty.  No Mongolia or China or India...his only goal was Hollywood. But not to worry.  A story like this is too good to abandon.  Several years later, another Polish WWII officer, one Witold Gliski, suddenly remember he was the guy who hiked to India.  Sad to say, the world has become a cynical place his claims have not been taken seriously.

So, if you are still with me and have not set out on foot to cross deserts, swim oceans and traverse ice floes to find me and shut me up, here we are at last, at the end. Okay, not quite the end, but you can see it from here. Honest. Four stars for ""The Way Back"" because despite its problems, I liked it, I never wanted to stop watching it, and I cared about the characters. You could do worse.  Thank you for your patience.",1389052800,,2530,4.516411378555799

They walk over endless miles of snow and then desert, seeking sustenance in a frozen tundra by stealing from wolf packs, consuming insects, catching fish and drying them for later consumption, and pure luck finding a mud-bound animal, etc.  They walk through the desert and magically find an oasis that they are afraid to leave behind.

4325628,5,B004C45AZU,"Excellence: Locations, Cinematography, Casting, Believability, Emotion, and Story

Without any spoilers, know that this movie is at times tough to watch; not graphically, but emotionally. Yet it is invariably, as other reviewers have noted, emotionally and intellectually rewarding.

In 'The Way Back', you will become tied to the characters and will suffer heartache and joy along with them if you allow yourself to be immersed in its story. This movie is a true epic; quite literally. The journey will amaze you without forcing you too deeply into worldviews or politics surrounding the affair (though I cannot imagine anyone could come away from this story feeling pleased with the fruits of Communism in Europe, despite its best intentions). The religious message is beautiful and unobtrusive - perhaps even ambiguous. I would like to know more about the faith of these characters and the great willpower which drove them to persevere through the unimaginable.

I am thankful that movies with this depth are still being made. I give extra praise to the writers/producers/directors for not sacrificing depth and clarity by including excessive vulgarity or pornographic material. I am certain if you watch it, you will in no way feel as though the realism is sacrificed by not showing the obscene.",1388188800,,1299,5.235576923076923

The acting is terrific, and the story is totally engaging and inspiring.  My one quibble with the film as presented here on Amazon is that the closed captioning, which I needed some of the time to understand the accented and soft-spoken dialogue, was delayed several seconds from the time of speaking, and this was a bit maddening at times.",1384041600,,663,4.593220338983051

4325754,5,B004C45AZU,"A true story always brings attention. This one earns high stars because the direction, and performances are top notch. Subdued and strong at the same time. Especially with Ed Harris, who never seems to disappoint. Harris is just a rock of an actor. Solid and always enjoyable to watch. The rest of the cast works nicely and seems to understand an instinctive pacing and sense of gravity to their characters and situation. No doubt this is due in significant part to director, Peter Weir.

Historically speaking, the earlier war scenes and archival footage combine to illustrate the horrors of unchecked power, followed by the profound dynamics of societal resistance and rebellion. While this film's story focused on a small group of people escaping a gulag, by the final frame, I couldn't help but be left with thoughts about how powerful people can be, en masse, to effect change, for better, or worse, across entire countries or political systems.

An impressive piece of filmmaking and storytelling.

4325755,4,B004C45AZU,"I watched the special feature documentary about the making of the film and decided beforehand I probably wouldn't endure the entire 2 hours of this almost plotless movie.
But the characters were developed enough as it went along to be intriguing just in terms of the individual personalities of the 7 people who slog it out on foot arduously to escape from the Gulag to India ultimately.
The young woman who is soon discovered shadowing the original 6 is apprehended as a potential local who might turn them in for bounty, but really is a fellow escapee from a collective farm who they decide reluctantly to take along with them.
She is the charming Irish actress who played in Lovely Bones.
All of the characters movingly care and take care of each other selflessly all along the trek with very little conflict.
So they traverse one stark landscape after another, losing two of their members to exhaustion and death along the way after one of them (Colin Ferrel), who is the only one not a political prisoner but a common street criminal, decides he would rather take his chances and remain in Russia.
First they leave Siberia, then encounter the desert in Mongolia (filmed in Morocco), then China and the Great Wall, and Tibet, where for the first time they receive hospitality, food, housing and warmth.
Three of them however decide not to wait until the Spring and intrepidly cross the Himalayas and arrive in a verdant valley in India, where they are received by tea pickers.",1382832000,,1480,4.762645914396887

They bring to the DVD an accumulated storehouse of wonder, gratitude and thanksgiving.  For them, the film need not be better than it is to have the reading experience enriched and satisfaction delivered.  My review will critique only the film itself without any prior acquaintance with the book.  I come to the film with a clean slate and rate it strictly as cinema.

Anyone who's seen a few National Geographic & Michael Palin travel films will pretty much visualize what the trekking part (97%) of this film will contain without buying the DVD. We've seen the majestic & forbidding landscape countless times.  People sharing canteen water and collapsing in the desert sands + ""suspense"" on the order of ""Are those date palms a mirage?"" and the stampede forward --- all are standard fare.  The trek is cliche ridden (as it has to be, given the paucity of possibilities.) and downright ho-hum.  interpersonal dynamics between the trekkers are weak as water.  One can't help feeling as the hours pass that the director is tearing his hair out and will pay any price just to finally get the thing in the can.

It's a disservice that the quote that adorns the DVD case is soaring, unqualified and ecstatic.  ""The year's MOST AMAZING and INSPIRING film.""  THE YEAR'S MOST .  .  .  .  ?  And what's ""amazing"" (i.e., unexpected) about the trek we saw?  Everything in there was what we expected the moment we knew mountains, deserts and distances lay ahead.

I respect people who genuinely enjoy the low key realities of this film, carried along in an assenting daydream and relieved not to have to watch car chases, drug smuggling, exploding oil trucks and machine gun blasts on the streets.  The film is soothing and calming in that sense, but the trusting folks who hope to find what the extravagant blurbs promise will be sobered.",1382659200,2,1935,4.788519637462236
4325764,5,B004C45AZU,This movie based on real events was extremely hard to fathom. The struggle for freedom shows just what the human is capable of achieving. Could not take my eyes from the screen. A must see for all.....,1382572800,,201,4.45945945945946
4325765,5,B004C45AZU,"When I first saw this movie, I was amazed how the storyline was situated around five Polish men who wanted to gain freedom and walk from Siberia to India for a better life. This was a great movie on how freedom is important for people in society. The main character was determined to keep moving on from his hometown in Siberia, but he and his group struggled through a lot, i.e. the death of the young girl in the desert who died of starvation and dehydration. As they were traveling to India, the group's relationship grew even stronger and they kept each other safe.",1382572800,,569,4.480769230769231

4325770,3,B004C45AZU,The movie was ok.  It got a bit slow at times and made you wonder how the hell they walked that whole way.  I had to look up the actual distance on a map just to see how far they actually walked.  What was funny was they never encountered any ferocious wild life during their travels. Other than the natural elements they encountered it was a one long walk.,1382400000,,357,4.144927536231884

4325777,5,B004C45AZU,"The beginning is deceptive at first starting out with Russian dialog and subtitles.  I almost opted out in search of something else.  Waiting to get further into the movie is rewarded with excellent writing, acting and directing with a riveting tale that kept me glued till the end.  This 5 stars all the way for acting and directing. You will not be disappointed.",1381968000,,364,4.746031746031746
4325778,5,B004C45AZU,"Very interesting film, it intrigued me so that I ordered the book. Of course Hollywood does interpret otherwise, but still worth watching.",1381968000,,138,5.318181818181818

4325780,4,B004C45AZU,I loved the indomitable spirit of the prisoners. One's convictions and desires to be free can set off a whole chain of events that have the power to change a situation or the people involved. This is such a movie.,1381968000,,213,4.35
4325781,5,B004C45AZU,This movie so haunted me that I had to get out of bed at 3:30 AM and watch it again. It is unnerving and beautiful at the same time.,1381968000,,132,3.586206896551724

4325784,5,B004C45AZU,"This is a new favorite of mine.  Hard to say much without giving the story away, but it's set in the WWII era and goes on to tell about the journey a select few escapees made.  Excellent cast with good acting & directing.  No special effects, but none are really needed for this story.  To me it feels realistic and gets the viewer's attention.  I recommend it.",1381708800,,361,4.3283582089552235

4325791,4,B004C45AZU,"It was a very moving movie, some awesome acting and a real plot. Not sure how far I could have gone. The fact that it is a true story is amazing in itself.  However, it had a negative message that said it's bad to help others as it could kill you.  Also, it didn't really tell you what happened to one of the characters.  But, it is an attention holding movie based on a true story that I would watch again.",1381190400,,407,4.0
4325792,4,B004C45AZU,I never heard about this movie before I selected it from a list on Amazon Prime. It is based on a true story which proves truth is better than fiction.,1381190400,,151,4.066666666666666

4325795,4,B004C45AZU,I am not a movie reviewer so I'm not going to go super in depth. The movie was good and entertaining. If you like tales of survival and endurance you'll like this. The human spirit is resilient.,1381190400,,194,4.27027027027027
4325796,4,B004C45AZU,Excellent acting and directing.  The historical perspective and motivational impetus of the characters are highlights of the film.  See it.,1381190400,,139,5.9
4325797,3,B004C45AZU,"you can tell that editing had to take out large chunks to make this movie fit in the time they had.  as a result, it jumps from scene to scene, at times, and you cannot tell why or how they got there or how they got tool or how they got clothes and coats, etc...",1381104000,,262,3.7636363636363637
4325798,5,B004C45AZU,This movie presents the hardships that prisoners must have experienced while in a gulag and harshness of those conditions causing an overwhelming desire for escape.,1381104000,,164,5.6
4325799,5,B004C45AZU,"This movie is based on a dull subject, people on a very long walk across Asia from Siberia to Asia.  But the film is so engrossing, it is like watching these people strive, endure and struggle in their very long walk of a thousand miles or more from an unmanned drone with a fantastic camera.  The result I did not wait for the film to come to an end.  This is a great film about tragedy and endurance during a very brutal time of Communist Russia during the dictator reign of Stalin and World War II.  It does not paint Communist Russia or Communism as some nice but misunderstood socialist state, but all the tyranny and injustice that many people experienced during this time of history in Russia and those nations nearby.  This film could be a great film of fiction based on many typical examples of persons who lived during this time in these countries, but when you realize it is based on real people on a real event then this movie becomes a must see movie.",1381017600,,964,4.393258426966292
4325800,3,B004C45AZU,Good movie. However it was not near as good or as well done as the book.  Books always seem to be better than the movie.,1380931200,,120,3.8
4325801,5,B004C45AZU,Gripping story; told in a way that only Peter Weir can do. Wonderful. Ed Harris and Colin Farrell give very strong performances. Just and amazing story.,1380931200,,152,4.884615384615385
4325802,4,B004C45AZU,Good movie.  Didn't think it was going to grab me but I did enjoy watching it.  The scenery was beautiful,1380844800,,105,4.2

4325806,5,B004C45AZU,This movie was very riveting and moving from the beginning to the end. It is amazing what the human spirit will do to survive at all costs. It was very realistic and the acting is superb. Very breathtaking scenery. I would highly recommend this movie!,1380672000,,251,4.6
4325807,5,B004C45AZU,What a great movie!  I would watch it again.  Highly recommend this movie.  Super mind blowing what these people endured.,1380585600,,121,4.95

4325809,4,B004C45AZU,"Great drama with excellent cast and acting, although it get's bogged down in a couple of spots. Very inspiring story!",1380499200,,117,4.9
4325810,5,B004C45AZU,"A handfull of political and criminal prisoners in the early days of Stalin escape from a gulag in northern Siberia and walk to freedom!?  Fact is stranger than fiction.

I hadn't heard anything about this movie, but one day I read a short blurb about it and added it to my ""movies to watch someday"" list.  It eventually worked its way to the top of the list and I sat there totally mesmerized by it.  I started watching it late one weekend night, planning to watch a bit and finish it the next chance I got.  Before I knew it, it was 1am!  And I'm not a night owl.  Man, what a conclusion!

These prisoners conquered the unimaginable!  They trekked south out of the Siberian Taiga, only to face Mongolia's Gobi Desert, and, well, I won't give everything away...

The central cast is small, but powerful.  The forces that drive the group are varied, and for the most part inspiring.

Don't get me wrong...while this is a powerful movie, it is not for all ages.  It's PG-13 rating is well chosen.  This movie is not for small children - teens, OK, but not small children.  The conditions that these people endure in the gulag and on their trek are for most people completely unimaginable.  The specters of snow, ice, cold, desert, thirst, heat, etc., are beyond daunting.

Though I watched this movie for the first time only a couple of days ago, I have already recommended it to several family members and friends.

Definitely a 5-star offering.

I wonder why I never heard about it when it was released back in 2010?",1380499200,,1516,4.507352941176471

4325813,5,B004C45AZU,My big brother (17 years old) and I (16 years old) enjoyed this movie immensely. Amazing story of survival!! Would highly recommend.,1380412800,,132,5.045454545454546

4325815,5,B004C45AZU,"More then I expected. Great development of characters. Anguish, torment, self-flagellation. The only limits to human endurance are physical and then mental. The spirit depends upon them both.",1380326400,,191,5.857142857142857

4325838,5,B004C45AZU,"This is a story of brutality by an evil, dictatorial government at its worst. The soviet system of justice under Joseph Stalin was rule by total fear. People who were under any form of suspicion were subject to judicial punishment consisting of decades in Siberia prisons with little hope of survival. This is a film based on a true story of seven men who escaped and found freedom by traversing some of the harshest terrain imaginable--from the cold mountains of Siberia to the torrid heat of South Asian deserts. I found this a compelling film and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing the results of man's inhumanity to man as demonstrated by tyrannical and despotic governments.",1379030400,,702,4.858333333333333

Nothing was ""cheesy"" or poor quality, but there were no really impressive visual scenes or highly engaging moments. It was a very interesting story, it was compelling, and there were some good plays on emotions. However, it wasn't quite a ""5-star"" movie.

4325873,4,B004C45AZU,"The Stalinist era was one of the worst in history and most communist nations are much better ,but nothing can compare to true story of the german soldier who escaped the gulag. This isn't that story though. It's a work of fiction. but it's still a good story about men trying to escape the gulag and  find freedom away from Stalin's death camps. Ed Harris, who has never given a bad performance is in this one. And that helps a lot.  COlin ferrel is also very good in this. The rest of the cast is largely unknown, except the guy who plays the actor in the camp.  But they do a good job. This is a gritty and realistic story of survival against the odds. I wish someone would have done the true story though. IN hd this looks much better , but it's a dark film and don't expect science fiction type of effects! .  I enjoyed this film and if you like solid survival dramas based on history , then this one is for you. The blu ray , of course is the way to go if you buy this one.",1377475200,,978,4.051813471502591

The performances were all extremely good, particularly Colin Farrell's gulag gangster. The vastness of Siberia and Central Asia was captured beautifully, but the enormous spaces were balanced by the sense of a few actors on a small stage.

4325878,5,B004C45AZU,"THE WAY BACK (USA/United Arab Emirates-2010) is based on an actual event: the WWII escape of six men from a Siberian gulag. They cut through a barbed wire fence during a blizzard and head south toward a large lake and the Mongolian border, both some 300 miles away. Struggling through dense forest and 40 below temperatures with very little food on hand, they barely make it.

At the lake, where they're able to catch fish and grow healthy again, the men meet up with a young teen girl who escaped from a collective workhouse. The seven set out for Mongolia, but once at the border they're confronted by a placard with a red star and Stalin's likeness on it, an indication this country won't be welcoming to escapees of Soviet captivity. Six of them press on for Tibet across the deadly Gobi desert; one remains in Siberia. Now they must endure a broiling sun, no shade or water and a massive sandstorm.

Two more die. In Tibet, they have to traverse the Himalayas. Ultimately, three make it to India after walking 4,000 miles across some of the harshest places on Earth. It's an incredible story of tenacity against the longest of odds.

Ed Harris (as an American arrested in Moscow at war's outbreak) and Colin Farrell (a Russian street thief) are part of the fine international cast. Farrell is exceptional. He brings subtlety to a character that could easily have been a caricature. This is easily his best film work.

The scenery is impressive, dangers palpable and the story grueling in many places. We suffer along with these freedom-seekers every step of the way. A most impressive motion picture from director Peter Weir. Highest recommendation!",1373932800,,1654,4.792982456140351

The ending is a little substandard and preachy but not awful by any means. Ed Harris does a great job. He makes the viewer care about his character. Colin Farrell does well. When Colin cares to try and act and go for it I put him right up there w/ some of the best. All actors come to work in this film and give great performances.

The stories of those in Western Europe during the war are consistently published but I feel that those persons coming out of Eastern Europe, under Stalin's control, have not shared their stories as easily. I think that if more people were to see this absolutely beautiful film they would take the time to research the stories a bit more. Or at least I have.

The film itself was wonderfully done. The landscape is gorgeous yet grueling at times. I found myself developing a fondness for each character and my heart broke numerous times throughout the film when one was lost. And to be honest, I found myself tearing up a bit at the end, in happiness though; it was the exact ending I had been hoping for.

All in all, I would recommend this film for someone looking for a serious movie night in. Though the ending is happy I would not say this is a ""feel-good"" film. So snuggle up with a blanket and enjoy :)",1353628800,,1136,4.35377358490566

4325917,4,B004C45AZU,"Based on a 1956 book by Sawomir Rawicz, ""The Way Back"" follows the grueling journey of a young Polish army officer Janusz Wieszczek (Jim Sturgess), who is sent to a Siberian forced labor camp as a political prisoner during the World War II. He later escapes with other prisoners including an enigmatic American ""Mr. Smith"" (Ed Harris) and a knife-wielding Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell). The only way they can go is south, but that means they have to survive the freezing cold of winter and the sandstorm of the desert.

""The Way Back"" is director Peter Weir's first film in seven years (the last being ""Master and Commander"" in 2003). He was not a prolific director, and these days he is making less and less films - ""The Truman Show,"" his last but one film before ""The Way Back"" was made in 1998 - but he hasn't lost his touch. His latest film is long and sometimes feels drawn-out, but because of the interesting characters and the impossible situations they are in, the film remains engrossing. Even those who know something about the controversy over the authenticity of the original book will find the drama gripping.

""The Way Back"" benefits greatly from the exquisite on location photography and effective acting from the cast including Dragos Bucur, Alexandru Potocean, Saoirse Ronan, Gustaf Skarsgrd, Mark Strong and Sebastian Urzendowsky. The film is also notable for its great make-up effects (nominated for Oscar) that make the characters' harrowing experiences even more credible.

The epic-scale survival drama could have been more emotionally-charged, but ""The Way Back"" still succeeds as a story about triumph of will over adversity.",1351209600,,1658,5.043795620437956
4325918,4,B004C45AZU,"So many films are made about the Holocaust camps and other prison breaks, but I can't recall another film, with one exception, involving the Russian gulags. This made it interesting to me, though Peter Weir's style is often slow and pensive, and not much is shown of gulag life. Maybe someday someone will try to put some of Solzhenitzyn's work to film (aside from ""Ivan Denisovich""). As explained in the generous DVD extras, the Russians didn't keep records as the Nazis did. In effect, once you're in Siberia, bye bye...

It's a courageous tale, and more may have been done with some the the characters' back-stories. Jim Stugiss as Janusz is the most complete; Ed Harris is his usual brooding, intense self; the most complex character, played by Colin Ferrell, leaves the film too soon; and the wonderful Saoirse Ronan is on hand to provide further strife and concern.

Certainly, a 4000 mile trip, under these circumstances, would involve lots of opportunity for reflection and back-story, which Mr Weir often does well, but the story seemed to plod along as unguided as our heroes. In hindsight, this may have been his purpose.

The superb art direction and cinematography are to be commended; re-building a portion of the Great Wall was impressive. I'm sorry it was only Oscar nommed for Make-Up. At least Oscar recognized that it was a contender.

A lot has been said that it didn't follow the facts (or the various books, some subject to question), but the fact remains it is BASED on true events, and that alone begs for a film adaptation.",1350950400,,1548,4.80827067669173
4325919,5,B004C45AZU,"This movie was great.  I expected it though, because Ed Harris is such a strong actor I don't think I've ever seen anything he's worked in that wasn't good.

It misses being a better movie because it relies too heavily on the sweep and grandeur of the 4,000 mile trek to satisfy us, amazing as it is.  The script is a bit predictable and formulaic - you can recite some of the lines before they are said.  And the acting seems exaggerated at times, especially Colin Farrell as the ""criminal,"" as though the characters need constantly to remind us of the significance of what they are doing.

Even so, I enjoyed how the escapees from the Gulag all coming from different backgrounds learn to appreciate and complement each other as the journey progresses.  I think it is a great lesson on the importance of each individual.  Plus the story reminds us of the horrors perpetrated by Stalin and the millions who suffered and died.  Finally, Ed Harris has become a real treat to watch over the years and he always lends an edge to his characters that elevates whatever film he is in.",1346630400,,1035,4.497326203208556

4325924,5,B004C45AZU,"Quite simply, this is a masterpiece and one of the best films that I have ever seen.  Considering this film's big name stars and the fact that it came from the director of Witness and The Dead Poets' Society, it boggles the mind that it would have opened and closed so quickly.  Read no further, is you are concerned about ""spoilers""....

As per the Catholic News Service, it is a ""stunning portrayal of a 4,000-mile trek from Siberia to India by escaped political prisoners....'The Long Walk' -- the 1956 book on which [the]...script is based -- was ghostwritten by a British journalist for Slavomir Rawicz, a former Polish cavalry officer. Its tale of Rawicz's heroic 1940 escape from a gulag in the Soviet Union, through snowstorms, across the Gobi Desert and the Himalayas to political asylum on the Indian subcontinent made it a sensation during the height of the Cold War.  The details of the narrative have not held up to fact-checking, however, and there is some evidence -- as reported by the BBC -- that elements of others' escapes may have been woven into a single story, and that Rawicz himself may never, in fact, have fled.  All the same, this is a compelling drama. Its uplifting message about the need for extraordinary solidarity and Christian compassion in the face of every horror man and the wilderness can impose shows the power of a well-crafted epic.""

As explained further by Peter Malone, ""The central character is a young Polish patriot who is arrested by the Soviets in 1940, interrogated and denounced by his wife (under torture)....It is...[he] who has to find his way back home - the significant question of the title is the way back to what and to where - to meet his wife again and be reconciled with her. His is a quest for forgiveness and peace. It takes a long time. The film ends with a recapitulation of the Communist decades from the end of the War until the collapse of the Soviet Union and Poland's freedom. Watching the film is not an easy experience but the themes stay with you and are well worth reflecting on.""

As per Elizabeth Schiltz, this film is ""bursting with Christian imagery and symbolism -- crowns of thorns, crosses, images of Mary, etc.  The main psychological thread of the movie involves questions of redemption and forgiveness.""

Again, this is a masterpiece, and it does not speak well for us that it could have had such a short shelf life in theaters.  What will future generations think of us for frequenting such garbage as Hangover and its sequel, while ignoring this gem?",1338163200,,2537,4.719457013574661
4325925,5,B004C45AZU,"""The Way Back"" (2010) takes place circa 1940-41 and details a group's mad escape from a Siberian gulag through the cold Soviet wilderness into Mongolia, across the great Gobi desert, through mountainous Tibet and ultimately freedom in India. The film was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' popular book ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,"" but not based on it.

After records of Rawicz' release from the gulag by the USSR in 1942 were unearthed the veracity of his book was called into question; others suggest that, although the circumstances of the story may not have happened to author Rawicz, they're apparently based on real events with real individuals, like Polish soldier Witold Glinski. Besides, in light of the millions of prisoners carted away to Siberia during that time period, isn't it likely that a handful of them successfully escaped and had experiences similar to those shown in ""The Way Back,"" regardless of whether or not they made it all the way to India? Absolutely. In any event, director Peter Weir has plainly stated that the film is largely fictional and only inspired by the book, which may or may not be a true account.

The group's natural leader is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), not because he has any leadership charisma but simply because he spent half his life in the woods and KNOWS how to survive in such an environment. As Solomon said, ""A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength.""

Also along for the haul is a cynical American called Mister Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian hooligan named Valka (Colin Farrell), a comic accountant, an artistic pastry chef, a priest, a Pole with night blindness and a teenaged girl named Irena, played by Saoirse Ronan, who incidentally celebrated her 16th birthday on the set.

Needless to say, this a story of survival. The group faces freezing nights, lack of food & water, bugs, death, the never-ending Gobi desert and the Himalayas, not to mention the inevitable moral questions that arise from such a life or death situation. Some have complained that the film involves too much walking, but that's the whole point - the film's about a 4000-mile escape on foot to freedom.

The movie drives home some powerful messages that will be pondered well after viewing:

- The government in communistic or extreme socialistic states is a cold, uncaring, demonic machine that will immediately squelch dissidents through any measure possible, including torturous coercion and slander.

- Such godless governments are a vile social infection that spreads and must be escaped at all costs.

- Is this socialistic disease now spreading to America in a formative stage?

- Better to die free than live in a gulag or under dictatorial socialistic governments.

- No matter how bad it is, at least you don't have to live in a gulag.

- Mongolians and Tibetans are people of true honor.

- Saoirse Ronan is a precious young lady.

In addition, the film features a great score and spectacular locations, filmed in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.

RUNTIME: 2 hours and 13 minutes

This film does the book justice in as far as it could. It hits all the high points but due to the time constraints of the medium, it leaves out many particulars.

There is one big problem.  The journey they undertake is so fantastic that it requires a solid foundation in fact for us to suspend our disbelief as to the rest.  We are led to believe that the foundation exists, because the central character did after all escape from the Gulag Archipelagio in 1941, cross the Siberian waste, the Gobi Desert and the Himalayas on foot, and eventually find sanctuary in British India.  However, on reading Wikipedia afterwards, I find that scarcely any of this is true.  In that light, the whole film resembles the happy ending - it is all hogwash.

This time Weir focuses on the epic escape of seven prisoners of a courageous Soviet Gulag in 1941. Based on true events, this group walked for over a year a 400-mile journey from Siberia to India.

Weir managed to secure a steady hand and pulse a difficult film, full of emotional surprises and pulsating tension. All the cast except Colin Farrell whom I felt I found a bit overacted, with little punch expressive. But Ed Harris shines like a crazy diamond and Sturguess Jim (who is slowly steadily ascend the rise to stardom because of his innate acting talent).

A film of multiple readings so far tells us what the human will is able to do for being free and avoid the stifling oppression that violates and restricts the regime of freedom in a country as vast as Russia.

When they get to Mongolia they find out it is also under Communist control and change their plans to hoof it all the way to India. It's a trek of 4,000 miles through the Gobi desert and over the Himalayan mountains. No easy trick.

This is a sprawling epic type film, the likes of which you don't see much these days. While I was viewing it I couldn't help but imagine what a tough shoot it must have been. Bone cracking cold. Mountains. Suffocatingly hot deserts. Rain. This couldn't have been very pleasant, but neither is the story. These guys (and one girl) had to endure a huge distance over generally inhospitable terrain. They starved for days on end and went with little or no water much of the time. The few times they found sufficient food or water, or weather that wasn't killing them, were as much a relief to me as it must have been to them.

This flick was shot really well. The camera work and use of location were astounding. The music score was varied and great. The make-up was great as well.

Struggling through dense forest and 40 below temperatures with very little food on hand, they barely make it.

Six of them press on for Tibet across the deadly Gobi desert; one remains in Siberia. Now they must endure a broiling sun, no shade or water and a massive sandstorm.

Two more die. In Tibet, they have to traverse the Himalayas. Ultimately, three make it to India after walking 4,000 miles across some of the harshest places on Earth. It's an incredible story of tenacity against the longest of odds.

Ed Harris (as an American arrested in Moscow at war's outbreak) and Colin Farrell (a Russian street thief) are part of the fine international cast. Farrell is exceptional. He brings subtlety to a character that could easily have been a caricature. This is easily his best film work.

The scenery is impressive, dangers palpable and the story grueling in many places. We suffer along with these freedom-seekers every step of the way. A most impressive motion picture from director Peter Weir. Highest recommendation!",1314576000,3,1654,4.792982456140351
4325948,5,B004C45AZU,"The revelation, in this movie for me, aside for the fact that it did not receive wider recognition, is Colin Farrell. His inhabiting of the gangster is so natural and frightening, while at the same time he shows you brief glimpses of the man's hidden humanity, his desire and need for closeness to other people. The others are all fine as well but he particularly stands out.

I like this movie precisely because it is utterly unsentimental. These people are out to survive and death does not stop their drive. Death is heartbreaking because these characters have already survived so much that the injustice of their falling short so close to their goals hits hard. It also points out a truth; that life is not fair and guarantees nothing. Two moments hit hard; when Ed Harris' character releases the young girl so that she can die and when the group spends the cartoonists last night reviewing his sketches, letting him know how much they appreciate his art. Simple, not overdone and beautiful.

Movies that can communicate powerful emotion without overdoing it are rare (think Tender Mercies with Robert Duvall). This movie is very fine and worthy of repeated viewing. In my top twenty and in my opinion a must see.",1314403200,2,1217,4.79047619047619

The film isn't boring - at least, to me - but I can see some people seeing it that way, especially if you're used to today's action movies.

The scenery is magnificent and some of the shots by director Peter Weir are jaw-dropping on this Blu-Ray DVD. This is Weir's first film since the 2003 ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World."" The man does quality work.

Ed Harris one of the few, if not only, actors in here whose English you can clearly understand, so it's a good idea to play this DVD with subtitles. You get a fair of amount of subtitles with the Russian characters, anyway, but none are distracting from the scenery or story. The characters and acting in here are good, too.

4325952,2,B004C45AZU,"In this film there is walking, walking, walking, and more walking as the viewer follows escapees from a Soviet Siberian prison camp during WWII to India with several dying off along the journey. The landscapes in this movie are quite striking but can't overcome the tediously thin plot.

Director Peter Weir based this film loosely on The Long Walk by former Polish Army lieutenant, Slavomir Rawicz. Investigations have raised serious doubts whether Rawicz actually made the 4000 mile trek from Siberia to India as he claimed.

The only upside to The Way Back is it does focus attention on the little-known deportation of Poles (1.7 million) to the Gulag by the Soviets during the Second World War. Those interested might want to check out a personal account of the deportation, ""When God Looked the Other Way: An Odyssey of War, Exile, and Redemption,"" by Wesley Adamczyk.

It was interesting to see actor Ed Harris in this film. You may remember Harris defiantly sat on his hands in protest when director Elia Kazan received an honorary Oscar in 1999. Kazan had quit the American Communist Party in 1936 and subsequently named names in front of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, becoming forever the scorn of liberals. I wonder if Harris feels the same way about Kazan after participating in a film which exposes some of the horrific excesses of Stalinism?",1311379200,4,1386,4.939914163090129

There are many doubts about the veracity of the this perticular individual's story, due to historical evidence to the contrary. He was most likely released to go fight for the Soviets on the Eastern Front, and then immigrated to England.

Having said that, there are accounts of people walking of Siberia from the camps there during WWII, including an eyewitness account of several who miraculously ended up walking into India from Nepal.  A feat of the greatest human spirit and determination, due to incredible hardship, severe weather, and desolate barren wilderness/desert.

In any case, the story came across as believable and was well acted and produced. And one comes away with an awe at what some actually accomplished during this aweful time in history.

4325955,4,B004C45AZU,"I first came across THE LONG WALK - and the controversy about its veracity - several years ago on Radio 4. So when I heard Peter Weir was basing a film on the story I knew I'd have to see it - even if I've waited till DVD.

The result is an engaging and visually impressive, if ultimately flawed, work.

The most striking thing is its cinematography. It's no wonder that THE WAY BACK was part funded by National Geographic. There are some beautiful landscape shots photographed by Russell Boyd, with director Weir referencing everything from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA to his own GALLIPOLI. It's not just landscapes, however - elsewhere there are other striking images, such as the snow masks cut from wood.

It's also an exhausting film. The pace is often elegiac and as the characters walk from Siberia to India, this viewer felt worn to her joints (especially in the gruelling desert scene). It's hard to imagine that human beings could endure such privitations. The result is deeply absorbing; I felt drawn into the narrative

Nevertheless, the film does have its faults. Ed Harris and Jim Sturgess are both watchable but the supporting cast are not well drawn enough. I didn't even know their names, a problem exacerbated by their physical similarities. I also felt the film was let down by the ending which is weak and rather unsatisfying. The result of these criticisms is that THE WAY BACK isn't as emotional as it should be.

That aside, this is an inspirational tale of physical and spiritual endurance; one to watch when you feel like getting away from the rat-race, or are in quiet and reflective mood.",1309737600,2,1606,4.741935483870968
4325956,4,B004C45AZU,"THE WAY BACK is a discovery: there are some themes of films such as the bleak one this title suggests that we too often avoid, think that there is only so much that can be expressed or processed in a long stretch of a prolonged escape.  Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of this film. It begins in 1940 'when seven prisoners attempt the impossible: escape from a brutal Siberian gulag. Thus begins a treacherous 4,500-mile trek to freedom across the world's most merciless landscapes. They have little food and few supplies. They don't know or trust each other. But together, they must withstand nature at its most extreme. Their humanity is further tested when they meet a teenage runaway who begs to join them on their quest. A compelling testament to the human spirit, this gripping wilderness adventure is Peter Weir at his hypnotic best', as one critic from the Telluride Festival phrased it.

The screenplay by Peter Weir and Keith R. Clarke is based on the Slavomir Rawicz novel ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" and despite the controversy about the facts as portrayed in this film, this is a human versus nature drama that quietly explodes with an intensity that is at times nearly unbearable, while at other times extraordinary in the manner it shows how men survive the most impossible obstacles. From the beginning of the film in a Soviet Gulag the escapees include a Polish political prisoner Janusz (Jim Sturgess), a Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), and  American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) who was caught working in Moscow when war broke out, and Zoran (Dragos Bucur), Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), Kasik (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and Voss (Gustaf Skarsgrd). During their 4500 mile across the Gulag, Siberia, the deserts of Mongolia, the Himalayas in China and into India they encounter a young girl Irena (Saorise Ronan, in an incredibly sophisticated performance), also escaping the Soviet Union, and she becomes part of the survival team.

The well-written script allows the human element in all its forms to rise out of the struggle with Nature and thanks to Peter Weir's astute direction and the incredible cinematography of Russell Boyd  the epic is a deeply moving tale. Grady Harp, June 11",1307491200,5,2248,4.920844327176781
4325957,4,B004C45AZU,"Watching `The Way Back' the other night, I found myself baffled that it wasn't wholly embraced by The Academy.  I know that the Oscar campaign was basically nonexistent, and that itself makes me scratch my head, but the buzz surrounding this film and the big names attached (Ed Harris, Peter Weir, Colin Farrell) should have caught the attention of Academy voters, not to mention the fact that the subject matter is Oscar bait personified.  In the beginning of the Oscar year, 2010, I was certain that `The Way Back' was going to nab nominations for Picture, Director, Screenplay and a win for Ed Harris.

None of that happened.

Now that I've seen the film, I confidently feel that Jim Sturgess would have become an Oscar nominee had this film received a better campaign.

`The Way Back' pertains to a journey a group of POW escapees make from a Siberian labor camp on through the Himalayas and into India during the 1940's.  The group is a multinational group, led by a Polish prisoner, Janusz, who was turned over by his wife after being accused of being a political spy.  The group grows and then narrows as stragglers tag along and members die off, but in the end this powerful story of survival will rest heavily on your heart.

But, maybe it is the allegations surrounding the film's authenticity (of the story's authenticity I should say) that caused it to fare poorly with Oscar.  Being toted for so long as an actual occurrence, the source material for the film (`The Long Walk', written by Slawomir Rawicz) has been proven falsified.  So, with claims as being `inspired by actual events', `The Way Back' could be seen as unfathomable and misleading.  That is no fault of the film, which was filmed with such precise forethought.  Weir now considers this a mainly fictional work, and seen as such the film really can be appreciated for what it is.

Earnest and intelligent.

The performances here are collectively great.  Colin Farrell is outstanding, proving once again that he has more than one trick and can pull off nearly anything thrown his way.  Ed Harris is somber and controlled.  I love a subtle performer, but I often find Harris more `dull' than subtle.  Here he balances his performance to feel authenticated and natural.  I just LOVE Saoirse Ronan and think that she is going to continue to slay every performance she gives.  She is just impeccable.  Jim Sturgess really blew me away.  He is a young and fairly unknown actor and yet he commanded the screen and really took the reins of this performance and steered the film where he wanted it to go.  His emotional connection, accent work and physical demeanor were perfection.  Like I said, a better campaign and he would have easily taken Jeff Bridges' nomination.

In the end, the film isn't without fault.  Like some critics have mentioned, the film feels slightly cold at times, and the film can seem rather endless despite the fact that the running time is barely over two hours.  Because of the films subject, it can seem slightly redundant, but I felt that Weir combated that with interesting character development and nicely placed dialog that helped keep you interested in what you were watching.  The final scene is heartbreaking, if not a tad clichd, and it works well; although I kind of hated the collage of `information' leading up to it; especially with the feet walking all over the screen.

Despite the fact that the event depicted in this film most likely DIDN'T happen, this is still a heroic tale that is wonderfully acted and sharply directed and certainly a MUST SEE for everyone.",1307404800,2,3577,4.770731707317073

The Way Back is the story of an epic journey and the determination of the human spirit. Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society) directs and gives us an inspirational tale of hardship, perseverance, and what it means to be free.

I wouldn't normally suggest this, but it's a good idea to skip the first chapter of the film. Those first two minutes and 15 seconds contain two things: a list of credits explaining which studios were responsible for making the film and a brief text-only prologue. The prologue reveals too much of the story. It explains how many people survive the journey, their gender and where they walk to. The film still works, but I think it's better to view it without knowing those details. It was presumably done to pay tribute to those who made the historical journey. You won't miss a single frame of the film if you skip it.

The story opens with an interrogation sequence in which a Polish woman is made to inform on her husband, Janusz (Sturgess). He's sent to a Siberian prison camp as a result. The year is 1940; a time when Stalin and Hitler were trying to conquer various parts of Europe.

Janusz meets a variety of prisoners, but we aren't told much about their origins. Because of this lack of exposition, it's difficult to tell one prisoner from the other at the start of the film. They dress the same and are similar in appearance. The guards are confident that nobody will escape because Siberia is a snowy wilderness and surviving under those conditions is next to impossible. Janusz wants to try anyway and assembles a group willing to make the attempt.

We meet Mr. Smith (Harris), Valka (Farrell), Zoran (Dragos Bucur), Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean) and Voss (Gustaf Skarsgard). The prison scenes are subtitled for the most part, showing us that the party of escapees comes from several nations. It's a brutal existence and one man is killed for his sweater. The escape party trades for what food is available and breaks out of the camp, evading pursuit by armed guards and dogs.

The group has a vague plan based on where it thinks the camp is located. Conditions are harsh and blizzards are frequent. There are mountains in every direction. Some of the group hallucinates at times, but six people survive long enough to set off on the journey. After a while, it's clear that they are being followed. It turns out to be Irena, a young Polish girl (Ronan). She claims that her parents are dead and wants to join the group.

The remainder of the film is devoted to showing the journey. Terrain varies from freezing snow-covered mountains to open desert. Food and water quickly run out and the group is forced to live off the land. Their footwear isn't up to the task and most of the party has to deal with walking on blistered feet with open wounds. Dialogue is sparse and we never learn much about each character. The story becomes a dour struggle for survival.

When the story of the journey is coming to a close, we are shown a montage of historical footage dealing with the collapse of communism. It brings us out of the 1940s and as far as 1989. The final scene is the most uplifting in the film and ties up a loose end.

I won't say any more because, as I said at the start of the review, too many details ruin the suspense.

Weir's film is well-acted, epic in scope and ambitious. The actors must have had a hard job adjusting to the different conditions as many scenes were shot on location in extreme cold or searing heat. The story deserved to be told. The thing is, the lack of character development doesn't give us much to care about other than the general survival of the group.

Video Quality 4.5
Russell Boyd's cinematography looks incredible on Blu-ray. Some of the scenes showing mountains or desert dunes are breathtaking. The transfer does justice to the film and detail is good throughout. The opening gulag scenes are deliberately drab and muted, but the brightly-lit scenes during the journey are filled with detail.

Audio Quality 5/5
The dramatic score sounds wonderful on this DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix, but the highlight is the use of ambient sounds. Whether the scene involves mining, a blizzard or a sandstorm, you'll feel like you are there. More subtle sounds are also evident. While some of the accents are heavy, the track reproduces them clearly.

Special Features 2/5

With the exception of a theatrical trailer, there's just one feature:

The Journey of the Journey (30:57) is a brief account of the problems faced during filming and includes comments from Peter Weir and the principal actors. It was interesting to see how some of the effects were produced, as well as discovering which countries were chosen to depict the ones used in the story. It's well worth a look if you are curious about the film. The low score is for the lack of additional features.

There are one or perhaps two characters with enough depth to make us care about them individually. The story held my interest and I admire some of the previous work from Weir and the four main actors, but the film is flawed. The focus is on the journey, but there's not enough background, exposition or character development to fully engage the viewer emotionally.

I would suggest this as a rental as its replay value would be limited for some.

4325971,5,B004C45AZU,"The characters of ""The Way Back"" are victims of the Soviet's war of terror on anyone who they suspected as being a threat.
The director shows the way it operated. Janusz (Jim Sturgess)a Polish soldier captured in the 1939 Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland is tortured to confess to treason. When he doesn't his wife is tortured to provide the evidence. Everything needs to be by the book. Charges, confessions and signatures are required.

Our introduction to the Gulag is swift and the preoccupation of the inmates revolves around survival, which entails keeping warm, getting enough to eat, staying away from dangerous jobs and looking after No. 1!

The period in the Gulag reminds me of the book by Alexander Solzenisyn, ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"", a book which can provide a deeper insight of life in the Gulag for those that are interested.

The film is beautifully filmed and I wish I'd seen it at the cinema to take in the panoramas, although as other reviewers have noted it seems a little rushed in places.

The actors are superb. I think Colin Farrell as Valka was superb. Valka being a Russian thug who wanted to join in the escape, but could never be fully trusted by the group. Mr Smith (Ed Harris), the veteran who provided the backbone to the escapees. The suporting actors all played their parts with gusto. They were joined by Irena (Saoirise Ronan), daughter of misguided Polish Communists who had moved to Moscow and been subsequently arrested. Irena had escaped and been living wild when she had latched onto the group. Irena adds a gentle balance to the gruff band of starving, exhausted escapees.

A stirring moment comes when the group comes to the Great Wall of China and they cross this barrier looking around in amazement.

Again I find moments in the film rushed and the very final moment could have been drawn out further, but overall I found this a very moving experiance. As one of my parents family suffered deportation to Siberia and had to endure a nightmare journey through the Soviet Union to reach British Persia after the 1941 ""amnesty"" and freedom, elements of which such as starvation, exhaustion and death are echoed in this film, this film has special significance.

Janusz said when asked what he plans to do; ""I'll keep walking till it's over..."".

4325973,5,B004C45AZU,"The Way Back is a saga of triumph of human will against oppression, sketched on a backdrop that is harsh, threatening, yet breathtaking and life sustaining. The movie takes us to the heart of life in Stalin's Gulags in the frigid fields of Siberia, where the inmates--common men of various nationalities-- have only one goal: warding off death that lurks everywhere.

Life here is dependent on the whim of nature and of man. If the sudden blizzard or the poisonous fumes in the mines do not snuff out a few lives every now and then, the slight provocation of the gun toting guards will. Trapped in the thicket of uncertainty, a motley group of determined men join hands in an ambitious plan to jump the bulwark of man and nature.

Survival, for them, is a protest against the oppression, and escape a victory over the oppressor. The escapees differ greatly from each other in their origin, vocation and attitude; but they are united in their resolve.

Polished and kind hearted Janusz acts as a perfect foil to the murderous thug, Valka. Mr Smith, the staid, no-nonsense American brave-heart counterbalances the soft and artistic Tomasz. Despite the apparent differences all have one thing in common: their painful past, which gives resonance to their resolve.

The way forward is as dreadful and treacherous as it was in the Gulag. Dangers and pain, in all imaginable forms, present themselves, but the band overcomes them one by one, through despair, doubt, sickness and even death. The joining of comely Irena, an escapee from a collective farm, brings some freshness to the worn out group.

As the wanderers traverse the most strenuous terrains, the movie presents some breathtaking vistas of the wondrous nature as the backdrop. These panoramas bring to mind the documentaries of National Geographic, and as the long shots of the travelers marching against these large canvases come in quick succession, they look formulaic.

`The Way Back' has a grim narrative, with surfeit of dread, despair, depravity and death. Even the jokes of the `joker' of the pack fall flat on the face of the somber proceedings. The episode of mosquito attack and finding of its remedy was the only effective comedy in the whole movie by my reckoning.

Members of the group die or leave the party. But the opening revelation about how many of them made it to freedom, acts as a big spoiler to the movie. The viewer's interest and anxiety begin to diminish after the declared number is reached.

Put simply, this well-executed film based on the memoir by Red Army imprisoned Slavomir Rawicz is very much reminiscent of ""As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me"" (see my review), but follows a group of Soviet labor camp escapees rather than a single individual, and so much of the plot involves relationships within the band rather than the individual psychological hardships depicted in the earlier film. Some of the melodrama that surfaces in the earlier film is also absent here, although I was not particularly fond of the roles played by actors such as Colin Farrell and Ed Harris, who presumably were cast to appeal to a broader viewer audience, although if doing so prompts more interest in this story it was probably worth the sacrifice. As I mentioned in my other review, the scenes of Soviet labor camp survivors traveling through the Siberian wilderness caused me to ponder the plight of the Donauschwabens in my own immediate family (descendants of Germans who had immigrated to an area that was later Yugoslavia, far removed from the political climate of the time who shared similar fates following the war due to their ethnicity), and the last segment of this film, involving some of the best closing scenes of all time, will be especially emotional to anyone who shares such a similar family history, and is one of the many reasons I will proselytize ""The Way Back"".",1304812800,2,1692,4.898954703832753

4325977,4,B004C45AZU,"There are some movies that you have a sense of importance about them, a feeling prior to watching that what you are about to witness is important and a film that needs to be seen. Films of this sort rarely live up to those expectations. THE WAY BACK is not one of those. This is a movie that people should see, people who need to know that the price of freedom isn't cheap.

Opening in 1943, we are introduced to Janusz (Jim Sturges) a polish officer who is accused of treason by the Russians. With the help of his wife who was tortured into making the accusations, Janusz is sent to one of the gulags (work camps) in Sibera. The gulags were the Russian equivalent of the death camps the Nazis had but not as well publicized or (as is revealed in the extras on this DVD) recorded as much as the Nazis did their camps.

Unwilling to remain in the camp, Janusz makes friends with another prisoner who says there is a way out. Given directions and the smallest of hopes that it can happen, the pair make plans to escape. But at the same time, they realize there is a better chance with greater numbers. They pick up several people in their plan and when the time arrives they stall the camp's generator and head for a weak link in the fence.

On the run facing the dangers of the frozen wilderness as well as the possibility of capture by the guards or by people of the area since they have a price on their heads, the group struggles on, keeping off the beaten path and making their way to what they hope is freedom. Among the group are an American who goes by the name of Mister Smith (Ed Harris) and a Russian criminal named Valka (Colin Farrell). Each has their own idiosyncrasies to add to the group, Smith doing his best not to care about anyone and Valka being the tough as nails killer in the group.

Their trek takes them across dangerous terrain and they soon feel that they are lost. Setting out on his own to make certain they aren't, Janusz finds the lake they have been searching for and their hopes rise. As they move along the lakeside path, they encounter a young woman named Irena (Saoirse Ronan) who asks to join them. Thinking she will just slow them down they deny her the chance, but she eventually does join.

Moving from the snow covered terrain to the warmer climate, the group continues to head south in hopes of finding the trans-Siberian train line. Once there they plan to cross over it and shortly find themselves in Mongolia where they think they will find freedom. Instead they find more difficulties and a reason to move ever forward heading towards the desert and almost certain death. And should they make that the next thing they will encounter will be the Himalayas.

The most amazing thing about this film is the fact that it is based on a true story. To watch and then realize this makes it all the more engrossing a film to watch and also a sadder one as well. With each step they take, with each encounter with the harshest items nature can toss their way, you wonder if you would have had the fortitude to do what these men did. You can call it a desire to live, a desire for freedom, stubbornness or just a will to live, but what they achieve is remarkable.

Directed by Peter Weir (who did MASTER AND COMMANDER, DEAD POETS SOCIETY, WITNESS and more), the film is placed in the hands of a master. He combines the story of the land and the harshness of it with the tale of men who bond beyond what most do. And at the same time he makes you realize that their hunger for freedom is one they will do anything to satisfy.

THE WAY BACK is not a happy go lucky film. It is brutal but not violent, gut wrenching but not gory, sad but filled with a happiness that comes from inside. It covers a wide spectrum of emotions. It also presents some amazing photography of natural scenes most of us are likely to never witness. But in the end it is an inspiring film and one that should be seen. Not backed by one of the major Hollywood studios, the film had a small release. The fact that it is available on DVD rectifies that situation. It gives those who didn't have the opportunity to see the film before a chance to watch it and perhaps appreciate their own freedoms just a little bit more.",1304467200,5,4223,4.336708860759494
4325978,4,B004C45AZU,"I've since learned that the novel this is based on has been brought into question; it's author, like so many others, having been caught embellishing or even outright making up events that never happened. This brought back flashbacks of Charrire's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Papillon/dp/B0008ENHUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Papillon</a>"" and my rose-colored-shattering introduction to the world of artistic storytelling and filmmaking.

It's a hurdle all true movie fans must overcome. A maturation and learning process to appreciate the variety of dramatic biographies like Papillon, which I now presume much, if not all, of the details have been juiced; giving the audience something stronger to engage with and in. I never think, ""Oh yeah, this is exactly how it happened."" It's foolish and naive. Films are inherently fictional depictions. Like paintings, it's what the artist perceives, not what's necessarily there.

So goes 'The Way Back', an incredible journey of human survival and endurance. Telling the tale of seven individuals who escaped one of the thousands of unimaginably horrific communist 'gulag' prisons, crossing the frozen Siberian Tundra, the Mongolian Desert, the western wastelands of China, and finally clawing their way over the Himalayan Mountains of Tibet into Free India. A truly epic and jaw-dropping 4,000 mile journey - all on foot with no supplies and only the threadbare lice-infested rags they were issued in the gulag.

Would this be more palatable if it were completely true? Of course. But the story that's being told is very moving and deeply felt, regardless.

Additionally, you can never go wrong when Ed Harris is in the cast. This coming from a reviewer who can't stand the man in real life - even I appreciate that he's one of the finest actors of my generation. He never fails to deliver and this is no exception. He's so good in so many things it's hard to add to superlatives without succumbing to redundancy. Suffice to say - he's absolutely great... again.

Saoirse Ronan is really laying the groundwork that will propel her to unimaginable heights. I've watched her career and skill level exceed every expectation in every production. While talking heads and bloggers were commenting on Lindsay Lohan this and Dakota Fanning that - I've put my all chips on Ronan as becoming the premiere leading actress of her generation.

An amazing production and one that reminds me of another ""lost"" HBO film titled ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gulag/dp/6303425577/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gulag</a>"" (1985).

4325979,5,B004C45AZU,"We are in a period in film history in which making a so-called epic might be equivalent to committing suicide. The current trends of action and special effects movies is what brings fast cash to the studios and apparently guides de tastes of the young moviegoers. So, when a grandiose and precious film like ""The Way Back"" gets made, my faith in artsy, old-fashioned filmmaking is partially restored.

The film begins in 1940, when Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is being interrogated and accused of sabotage and spying activities. He is sent to a Siberian Gulag, in which prisoners are told that ""if nature doesn't kill you, the locals will"" and where ""kindness... that can kill you."" It is a brutal environment, especially if, like Janusz, you are unfortunately condemned to be there for 20 years. It is miserably cold, the food is bad, and you either work in the mines or at the lumber mill - the mines being the worst. So it is a blessing that Janusz meets the right people to escape with him from that hell. He is joined by six other men, including Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) and Valka (Colin Farrell), and successfully makes it out of that inferno. However, as they try to get away and enjoy their freedom, they find out that almost every country that they walk through is also communist, which means that, if captured, they would probably go back to the Gulag. In addition, they have to fight extreme cold and hot temperatures, and lack of food and shelter. Their journey to freedom is costly, and it is truly a test of endurance and trust -- some of the escapees, like Valka, are criminals, and you can't really trust them. On the other hand, it is fun to watch Farrell play a bad guy. Along the way, as you might expect, some of them will perish.

""The Way Back"" was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' ""The Long Walk,"" and it was helmed by experienced director Peter Weir, who was also responsible for such majestic movies as ""Master and Commander"" (2003) and ""The Mosquito Coast"" (1986). This is a true inspiring and absorbing film about three men that ""in 1941 walked out of the Himalayas into India"" and ""survived a 4000 miles walk to freedom."" Also, as you can imagine, the cinematography by Russell Boyd is enormously captivating. The Blu-ray edition includes a making-of documentary and the trailer.

4325980,4,B004C45AZU,"Peter Weir's ""The Way Back"" embodies two extremes in film; it's an epic film that focuses on the individual. Based on a true story the film focuses on the atrocities committed by the Soviets during Stalin's reign of terror beginning just prior to World War II. Set in Siberia at one of the Soviet gulags ""The Way Back"" focuses on five political prisoners and one criminal who attempt the impossible; an escape from the gulag and a trek to freedom thousands of miles towards Mongolia. Januscz (Jim Sturgess) a Pole like many political prisoners was convicted on a false accusation of being an enemy of the State. Sentenced to 25 years in gulag building the Trans-Siberian Railway he discovers that many of the prisoners there were sent there on trumped up charges in order to create slave labor in the most inhospitable conditions imaginable. Striking up a cautious friendship with Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) an American engineer who migrated to find work in Russia during the American Depression, Voss (Gustaf Skarsgrd) a priest, Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean) , a criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), a cook with artistic ambitions and Zoran (Dragos Bucur). Januscz plans on escaping North with the help of these individuals when he and others are assigned to the mines where the survival rate is extremely low.

These men trek nearly 4000 miles along the way picking up a girl Irena (Saoirses Ronan) who has escaped from a collective farm after her parents were murdered by the Soviets struggling to survive on little to no food and stay out away from any authorities as they try and make their escape to live or die as free men.

Weir's tackled a number of genres over the years but the themes to his films remain the same about trying to retain our sense of self in a world knocked out of balance. While ""The Way Back"" manages to be an interesting and compelling film to watch it lacks the emotional resonance that is often at the heart of Weir's films. This is primarily due to the lack of major conflict between the characters or the lack of a challenge to Januscz leadership of this rag tag group of prisoners who all have their own reasons for wanting to escape but too little is shared too late when Irena becomes the main means of communication between these very different men. This isn't a fault of the acting but of the writing and, perhaps, of Weir's direction of the material.

""The Way Back"" receives a sharp a nice looking transfer to Blu-ray. Although some of the bleak vistas don't lend themselves to a colorful presentation, the awe inspiring photography still manages to capture the majesty of the vast wilderness that surrounds and often overpowers these men. Skin tones look quite nice throughout and natural. Detail is remarkably sharp throughout with nice depth. The film always looks like a film as well eschewing the overly ""digital"" look of many more recent films with minimal use of digital noise management.

Audio likewise can be quite brilliant particularly during scenes set in the ice or snow storms of Siberia. Dialogue remains crisp and clear throughout.

""The Journey of the Journey"" is a 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. Weir and the various actors are interviewed about the experience of making the film and we get to see plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of the building of the gulag which is evidently quite accurate in detail. The documentary is presented in SD and clocks in just over 30 minutes.

We also get the original trailer in standard definition as well.

But when I saw ""The Way Back last night, I was totally astounded by its intensity.  I felt I went through the entire journey with them, not just physically but also the emotional toll it took on them.  The understated human drama was so touching and you come away from this film thinking that despite the brutality of some, there is still an inherent goodness in human beings.

Early in the film, Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) told Janusz (Jim Sturgess) that Janusz' kindness will kill him.  But it was this kindness that got them through the ordeal they went through.  Even Valka (Colin Farrell), a murderer turned out to have some human decency in him.

Debate rages over the authenticity of the story which inspired the film, but it's presented in such harrowing, lush fashion that one can't help but become invested.

The book recounts the true story of a Polish cavalry officer who, like thousands of other innocent people, was wrongly imprisoned in Siberia. Unlike so many others Rawicz was able to escape the camp with a few other prisoners and literally walk thousands of kilometers to freedom. He did so with the help of his fellow prisoners, the camp commander and his wife, and an extraordinary amount of luck. He spent a year in the camp before his escape and was able to survive the long walk by luck, ingenuity, the help of his friends, and the amazing hospitality of the Tibetan people. His story is nothing short of extraordinary. The movie was unable to capture much of his miraculous story through glaring omissions and fictional characters. I do not understand why pivotal portions of the story were corrupted in the movie, fictional characters were added to the story, and major sources of life-saving support omitted completely. The only truth in the movie was an escape, a walk through Siberia, Mongolia, China, Tibet, and India with several fellow prisoners, and an eventual rescue. There was never any mention that Rawicz rejoined the Polish Army to fight in the war, survived the war, moved to England, remarried and had children. Peter Weir had the chance to tell an extraordinary story about the desire to survive, a triumph of the human spirit in the spirit of Shackleton and Forrell. He failed and did so miserably. I am glad that Rawicz did not see this terrible film. I encourage all to actually read his story, understand the hell he went through at the hands of Russian intelligence, the harrowing train ride and walk to the labor camp in the middle of a Siberian winter, and his his escape and trek to freedom. Forrell, a German soldier is another example of a lost soul remanded to a Siberian labor camp who, after his escape, walked through Siberia to freedom. Rawicz and Forrell were extraordinary men and deserve for people to read their stories and remember what they endured. At least the movie about Forrell, based on his story ""As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me"", was relatively well done and is also worth the time to watch.

4325990,3,B004C45AZU,"Peter Weir's epic film, inspired by The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom by Slavomir Rawicz, is a popular story that has embedded itself into the hearts the minds of several generations of readers.  A movie adaptation has been ""in development"" one way or another for over 50 years.  Burt Lancaster was attached as the lead at one time.  As written, the astonishing story is about Cavalry officer Slavomir Rawicz who was captured by the Red Army in 1939 during the German-Soviet division of Poland.  Rawicz is sent to the Yakutsk labor camp in the Siberian Gulag along with captive Poles, Finns, Ukrainians, Czechs, Greeks and a few English, French, and Americans.  After a year of extreme hardship, Rawicz and six comrades escape and make their way, on foot, over four thousand miles south to British India, where Rawicz reenlists in the Polish army to fight the Nazis!

There has been much controversy about the truth of this popular and inspiring story.  Although the circumstances of the story didn't happen to writer Rawicz, they apparently are based on real events and real individuals.  Peter Weir's movie is old school filmmaking.  Exotic locations and majestic vistas imbue the relatively modest budget ($30m) epic with more than a semblance of authenticity.  Ed Harris is a standout as the mysterious Mister Smith.  His wonderfully weathered, grizzled face matches the sometimes gnarly terrain.  Even with a plethora of walking and talking, this is a journey worth taking.

The Way Back is a beautifully filmed, lush movie that was ""inspired"" by a so-called true story. Unfortunately the story upon which it was based has been long known to be controversial, and more recently, known to have been fabricated by the author. The source material was a bestseller by a Polish army lieutenant Slavomir Rawicz, imprisoned by the Soviets after their invasion of 1939, accused of spying and shipped off to Siberia. In his book, he claimed that he escaped from the Siberian prison during a blizzard in 1941 and made his way with a group of others across thousands of miles to arrive safely in India. It is known that Rawicz actually was part of the thousands of Poles who were released from the Soviet work and detention camps from Siberia and from the steppes when the Russian-Nazi alliance fell apart and Sikorski negotiated for the Poles release. Rawicz, like my own father, made his way toward the south to join Anders army.
I guess that what bothers me most is that I simply do not understand making a movie based on a lie. Certainly if it had happened, it would have been an inspiration for a movie, but it did not, and I have to wonder what the value is presenting this story as based on or ""inspired"" by true events. If his intent is to underscore the resilience of the human spirit under Soviet tyranny, then there are many recently published books that could have served as the basis of a movie - The Ice Road or When God Looked the Other Way. Neither author spins a fantastic story of thousands of miles over snow, mountains, and desert, but both admirably (and more importantly truthfully) speak to Polish persistence and survival despite Stalin's attempts at extinguishing it.
To be sure, Weir films a visually gorgeous movie and it is worth seeing if for no other reason than the cinematography. But having said this the scenery takes center stage. The characters take a far back row. Janusz is remarkably flat and undeveloped and he develops little throughout the film. We discover nothing particularly interesting about him throughout the movie, even though he is the main protagonist.  Valka, a criminal who forces the group to take him with them proves to have a peculiar affinity for Stalin, and in the final analysis refuses to leave the USSR after trekking miles and miles across wilderness with them. Very strange. Ed Harris is, well - there. The rest of the characters are pretty forgettable.",1298073600,9,2532,4.715575620767495
4325992,4,B004C45AZU,"I won't wade into the controversy regarding the facts behind the story of this film. Just how true the story is and to whom it actually occurred won't be my focus. I'll write about the filmmaking itself. Peter Weir's entire career has been focused on this singular theme, man at battle with his environment. From the early day of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" to ""The Mosquito Coast"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""Master and Commander""... the same theme dominates his expression as a filmmaker. ""The Way Back"" was the perfect vehicle for him to explore this territory once again. He gets to film everything from wintry landscapes of Siberia, the deserts of Mongolia, to the Himalaya in China and even a little of India.

The cinematography is suitably sumptuous but in no way artificially gorgeous. There is bleakness as well as beauty in the images. The story and characters take second place to the forces of nature. This might be the lethal ingredient to many viewers and their potential engagement with this film. The main character Janusz has a back story and a character arc, but the others are fuzzily sketched. The talents of Ed Harris are mostly wasted but I suppose it's better to have him more in the background instead of how Harris typically dominates his movies with his shouting and lapses into anger. I thought Colin Farrell was miscast as a Russian criminal who provides a bit of comic mischief but the young Saoirse Ronan makes an impression as the lost young girl.

The main message of this film apart from the man versus nature dynamic is the idea that it's better to die a free man than live as a prisoner. Imagine having a sentence in one of those Siberian prisons. Making a break for it even with the high chance of death is preferable in my mind to a dull life of drudgery in this far off prison. Better to die in an icy forest or the rain starved desert die than working in a coal mine against your will. I wouldn't rank ""The Way Back"" as one of Peter Weir's best films but it's a respectable effort nonetheless, more worthy of a cinemagoer's time and money than a lot of content in theatrical release right now.",1296777600,66,2126,4.57742782152231
4325993,5,B004C45AZU,"It is easy to quibble with Peter Weir's ""The Way Back."" We get only thumbnail sketches, not portraits, of the lead characters, and the portion of their journey that you'd think would be the most spectacular--the trek across the Himalayas from Tibet to India--is swallowed up in a single jump cut. And don't even mention the Russian documents that cast considerable doubt on the truthfulness of the movie's source material.

Yet for all that, I regard ""The Way Back"" as a four-and-a-half-star movie, and I'm happy to kick in the extra half-star to give it the highest rating. This is because ""The Way Back"" has what very few movies give you--grandeur. And grandeur that is not just scenic, but moral. The film depicts a place that was literally hell on earth--the Gulag under Stalin--and the resilience of the human spirit under the worst conceivable conditions. So what if the story isn't factual? It tells human truths we all know in our bones, and demonstrates once again how the desire for freedom can survive any form of oppression.

As in his most recent film, ""Master and Commander,"" Weir in ""The Way Back"" depicts human figures in a landscape too vast to contemplate--in this case, the forests of Siberia and the deserts of Mongolia. In both films, nature is bigger than people, but the very humanity of people is what allows them--some of them, anyway--to endure and triumph. Russell Boyd's photography is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and the performances of Jim Sturgess, Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan are unforgettably vivid. (The others, unfortunately, tend to fade.) I can't help but feel that the late David Lean would approve of this film, which is the highest compliment for any film that aspires to be an epic. You might scratch your head at some of the choices Weir makes, but the main impression you will take away from ""The Way Back"" is the splendor of the human spirit.",1296518400,4,1905,4.840490797546012
4325994,5,B004C45AZU,"Over the last decade, many have felt increasingly pessimistic about the state of modern American cinema, a growing wasteland of sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, flashy effects and trashy writing.  There have been a few diamonds in the rough, but for the most part, we have watched the art of film rapidly devolve into a soulless industry with strictly financial motivations, pandering to the market of the lowest common denominator.

But the end of 2010 gave us hope for the next decade, with several strong releases, most notably this powerful offering from master film-maker Peter Weir (Gallipoli, Dead Poets Society, Fearless).  Weir is at the top of his game, taking us on a journey which, despite its two-hour length, seems to end all too soon.  As we follow a group of desperate Gulag escapees battling the cruel and beautiful indifference of nature, we witness not only an incredible story of human endurance, but also the true value of freedom and the price one is willing to pay for it.  The performances were nearly perfect - Ed Harris, Saoirse Ronan, and Jim Sturgess are particularly brilliant.  The characters are kept somewhat at a distance; we learn only enough about them as to establish a strong connection and human element, as we watch this band of relative strangers create intense bonds with each other during the ordeal.  The dialogue is minimal but effective, giving the film a more realistic feel over-all.  Cinematographer Russell Boyd, who has worked with Weir on such exquisite films as Gallipoli and Picnic at Hanging Rock, engulfs us in a stunning palette of landscapes across an epic expanse of Asia, from the snow-driven forest of Siberia to the vast emptiness of the Gobi Desert.  The cinematography alone makes this film worth the price to see it on a large theater screen, if you can.

Leaving the theater after this film, I truly felt a resurgence of faith in American film.  Hopefully we won't have to wait another decade for another great Peter Weir film!  The cast and crew of The Way Back have given audiences a wonderful gift, and I thank them for it.",1296518400,98,2095,4.870422535211268

4325996,5,B004C45AZU,"""The Way Back"" is a masterpiece, a must-see film for thinking people and for lovers of cinema as a serious art form. I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film, and was stifling tears. I could not resist applauding at the end. I couldn't wait to discuss it with friends. Several hours after I left the theater, I kept seeing everything - a meaty sandwich, clean water flowing from the tap - through the prism of ""The Way Back."" I'm a long-time fan of director Peter Weir, who gave us classics like ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" ""Witness"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously."" Weir has outdone himself.

""The Way Back"" depicts a long walk that Gulag escapees took from Siberia to India. I've been lucky enough, under luckier circumstances, to travel some of the world the film references, from Poland to the Himalaya. The film's authenticity in language, costume, even hairstyles, swept me up into its world.

Both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia attacked Poland in September, 1939, thus beginning World War Two. At first, the Communists killed and deported more people even than the genocidal Nazis. Over a million Poles were deported in cattle cars. Many died; many never returned. No one knows exact numbers. Many struggled to return home, traveling on foot through Eurasia, making shorter treks comparable to that depicted in ""The Way Back;"" I've met such people.

Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is a young Pole falsely accused by Soviets. His wife is tortured to force a confession. Without ceremony, he is shipped to hellish Siberian concentration camps and mines. Janusz determines to escape, with a ragtag, multilingual crew of followers.

Janusz is not particularly handsome, or muscular, or super intelligent. He doesn't have a commanding voice or swagger. His potentially fatal flaw, in this environment, is kindness. Jim Sturgess' Janusz is one of the best aspects of the film. In real life, true leaders usually are not like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Janusz grew up in the woods, and knows how to jerry-rig a compass to point his group south, and a mask to survive blizzards. In the world of Gulag escapees, that's enough to make him the big man. Indeed, Valka, (Colin Farrell), a very tough gangster, declares, or diagnoses, that Janusz is the leader, the man whom the other escapees must obey, both for their own individual benefit and the benefit of group survival.

Prison escapees traveling thousands of miles of the Eurasian landmass with minimal gear face multiple dangers, from malnutrition-caused blindness to mosquitoes to snakes to dehydration. Some succumb, and die en route. You can't help but bet the same horrible game of chance that Valka proposes: who will die next? And will his meat be tender - that is, will we resort to cannibalism? A crew member falls. Surviving companions, in stunning testimony to their own humanity, take the time, burn the calories, devote the effort, to fashioning makeshift graves, and funerals. And then they march on.

What looks very beautiful on a calendar - an unspoiled mountain forest of snow-dusted evergreens - is actually all but an execution chamber for a hungry fugitive with no tools and only rags for shoes. The last thing a good man sees after making the simple mistake of walking too far with a limited light source will not be a breathtaking natural vista but a comforting, wrenching, hallucination of home.

Weir's best choice as a filmmaker here was simply to get out of the story's way. ""The Way Back"" does not want to be your best friend. Weir makes no attempt to cozy up to the viewer, to sweeten the story with phony warmth or touching crescendos. Weir makes no attempt to juice the action with cinematic steroids. For much of the film, the viewer is watching one grueling step after another.

Guess what? This is what it's like to suffer for a goal, this is what it's like to be crushed, this is what it's like, purely by chance - not because you are a better person or because God likes you more - to survive. You go on, hour after hour after seemingly pointless hour toward your questionable, impossible objective. This film is an endurance test. It will separate the men from the boys. Folks who think a movie about fantasy, sexy ballerinas is ""great"" filmmaking, and who think that temporarily losing their cell phone service is a human rights violation, will probably walk right out of ""The Way Back.""

Characterizations come slowly and are not forced. We discover, in a ruined monastery, that one character had been a priest. We discover that a girl can get taciturn men to talk. Characters speak of food, as hungry people do. ""Add more salt!"" to a fantasy meal, one begs. Valka makes a decision that caused this viewer to cry. I never thought the film could make me care about this murderous thug, but it did. There is inevitable, and surprising, laughter, also not forced, but integral to the circumstances.

There are moments of high drama. The men must fight wolves. Weir could have lavished lengthy close-ups on those sharp teeth, snarling snouts and prickly pelts. He doesn't. The wolves are onscreen only long enough to establish what they are and what they are up to. And then the next deadly and impossible challenge rolls down the shoot at the viewer, just as it did for those who took this long walk, and the millions of other humans like them, who have survived life and death challenges under impossible conditions. ""The Way Back"" is, like those poignant grave-markers the marchers make en route, testimony to those who have lived anonymous and agonizing lives in this pitiless world. If you don't think about the big questions while watching this film, and if you're not grateful to the film for that, you don't deserve it.",1295740800,396,5717,4.8244897959183675
4325997,3,B004C45AZU,"""The Way Back"" is said to be about gulag escapees who, during World War II, trekked to freedom on a 4,000 mile journey from Siberia to India. I'm well aware that there are many true stories from that time about the triumph of the human spirit, but this particular story seems utterly impossible to me. Maybe it's because the film is based on an autobiographical book that has, for all intents and purposes, been debunked. Or maybe it's because director Peter Weir has flip flopped on the issue, on the one hand stating that the film is essentially fictional while on the other hand dedicating the film to those who made that journey. Then again, it could be something as simple as the way the film was written and shot. Whatever the case, this is one of the few World War II films that truly does seem like a work of fiction.

At the start of the film, a Polish POW named Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is sentenced to twenty years in the gulag after his wife was forced into signing papers implicating him as a foreign spy. Once there, the film's language barrier is conveniently dropped, at which point he meets a number of critical characters. They include a Russian gangster named Valka (Colin Farrell), a cynical Yugoslavian accountant named Zoran (Drago' Bucur), a Latvian priest named Voss (Gustaf Skarsgrd), an artist named Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), and a young pole suffering from night blindness named Kazik (Sebastian Urzendowsky). The most important is an American known only as Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), who now believes that kindness can get you killed.

An actor named Khabarov (Mark Strong) convinces Janusz that escape from the gulag is possible, despite warnings that the surrounding Siberian wilderness is unforgiving. They plot to hoard as much food as they can until the end of the winter, at which point they will go south towards Lake Baikal and eventually cross the border of Mongolia. Janusz eventually escapes with all the inmates listed above - with the notable exception of Khabarov, who was in fact preying on Janusz's youth and strength to boost his own morale in the gulag. Valka insists on tagging along so as to escape reparations for gambling debts. Mr. Smith decides that Janusz's weakness, his kindness, may prove beneficial. Who else but a kind person would carry someone should they be unable to walk?

So begins their harrowing journey, one that will take them from the snows of Siberia to the forests edging Lake Baikal to the Gobi Desert to a ruined monastery in Tibet to the Himalayas, the latter because it eventually becomes clear that India is the safest country for them. Along the way, they pick up an orphaned Polish girl named Irena (Saoirse Ronan), who's on the run and depends on the fugitives to take her to safety. They will all endure starvation, dehydration, heat, cold, and exhaustion. And, of course, not all of them are likely to survive.

Part of the problem is that the characters are little more than tiresome escapee stereotypes - broadly developed, simple minded, and always with the talk of their hopes and dreams. This occasionally allows for moments of unnecessary humor, as when Tomasz describes at length his recipe for seasoned chicken. Mr. Smith is probably the most complex character, but even then, he's only at the service of the film's message, namely that one cannot continue in life without forgiving themselves first. This is where Irena comes in; aside from using her youth and femininity to melt Smith's heart, she serves no real purpose to the story; this will prove problematic when he allows himself to feel long before the film has come to end.

Another problem is a confusing and unconvincing depiction of distance and time. There are long passages in the Siberian forest and Gobi Desert, but as soon as the characters reach the Himalayas, it's as if someone pressed the fast forward button; no more time is spent on their travelling, so we must assume that, after thousands of miles and stretches with little to no food or water, they suddenly have the strength to go from one side of the mountain range to the other. Never mind the thin air or the freezing temperatures.

The film is based on ""The Long Walk,"" a book in which Slawomir Rawicz recalls his experiences escaping from Siberia to India entirely on foot. This is interesting because in 2006, the BBC released a report based on Soviet records, some supposedly written by Rawicz himself; it stated that Rawicz was actually released as part of the USSR's amnesty of Poles in 1942. It also stated that, rather than walking to India, he was transported across the Caspian Sea to a refugee camp in Iran. Further complicating matters is a Polish World War II veteran named Witold Gli'ski, who in 2009 claimed that Rawicz's experiences were in fact his own. This too has been questioned. With so much confusion over something as basic as the truth, it's no wonder ""The Way Back"" is one of the least satisfying war movies of recent memory.",1295568000,7,4967,4.789964994165694
