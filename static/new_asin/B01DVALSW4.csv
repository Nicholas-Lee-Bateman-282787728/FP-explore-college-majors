7724830,5,B01DVALSW4,"in this age when films attempting to expand upon Saturday Night Live features have become a punchline, it's heartening to note that the good ones, The Blues Brothers and Wayne's World, haven't suffered any for guilt by association. although it's something of a miracle that The Blues Brothers wasn't the sort of fiasco Superstar or It's Pat! would become.
what you don't often hear anymore is that there was a time when it's release was rather dreaded, because it was threatening to hemorrhage into an incoherent mess of Michael Bay proportions. it's budget and schedule noticeably ballooned to such a degree than Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were forced to pull out of SNL's fifth season.
(presumably they intended to return for the sixth, but in the interim relations between Lorne Michaels and NBC reached such proportions that, for the time being at least, Michaels walked at the end of the season, as did most of the cast and writers, outraged on his behalf. one likes to think Aykroyd and Belushi would've been back has relations remained amicable, but who can say?)
the most obvious source of the delays, an element for which the film is still held in a certain awe, is that it cranked the car crash angle up beyond 11, to about 15 or 20. as if that weren't surreal enough, the film actually made something amusing out of that. no other movie has ever managed pulled this off, probably because most others which try - Cannonball Run, Speed Zone - are ultimately nothing but car chases.
one thing that might give you pause even today is it's 2 hour and 12 minute runtime. as a rule the better and/or more revered comedies tend to be of a more casual length, somewhere from 80 to 100 minutes. this is because comedy depends on momentum, and that's the point at which momentum tends to burn itself out. but of course this film has mitigating circumstances: it needs room for the musical numbers as well.
one reason the film actually works may be another thing people tend to forget: The Blues Brothers was never a skit. as Aykroyd and Belushi's vanity project, they were legitimately a band. when they did appear on Saturday Night it was as musical guest, and played with absolute sincerity. (yes, John Belushi could actually sing.) under the musical direction of Paul Shaffer, they'd toured between seasons, and it wasn't until their album Briefcase Full Of Blues made it to the charts that there was any reason to think they were a viable subject for a movie. so in terms of story they had a clean slate rather than something to live up to.
said story isn't exactly revolutionary, but is in the best tradition of comics from Charlie Chaplin to The Three Stooges. Jake and Elwood set out to do an important and noble deed, keeping the orphanage where they were raised from being foreclosed, but take it to such extreme measures as to incur the wrath of the police, a neo-Nazi outfit, a hillbilly band who's gig they manage to usurp, all the way up to the National Guard. of course it doesn't exactly hurt that the story is punctuated by passionate, high-energy performances by such musical guests as Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown. they were easy to get because most of them were sliding into Oblivion at the time and as such unemployed. so the movie effectively reinvigorated their careers.
the film admittedly doesn't completely escape the aforementioned excess, or as it's recently been termed, ""Bay bloat."" most obviously, the ultimate chase to the records office feels a bit drawn out. but for the most part, director John Landis actually manages to maneuver around it. the film isn't held down by it the way the Transformers sequels increasingly are.
then again. maybe it was just by comparison. it's interesting to note that the first known victim of what would come to be known as Bay bloat, as well as the first of the rare blots on Steven Spielberg's record, had come out the year before. 1941, also featuring Aykroyd and Belushi, is a textbook example of the aforementioned dangers of momentum. basically, it tried to maintain absolute chaos for two and a half hours. well, technically, it does manage to do just that, it just doesn't manage to make it terribly amusing.
as for the infamous Blues Brothers 2000, well, i'd say it should be cut some slack. i'm not calling it a masterpiece or even arguing that it was strictly necessary, but like many less-than-blockbusters, it's not so wretched as some would have you think.
it actually has some interesting ideas in it, not least of which the question of what newly paroled Elwood is to do with himself in the wake of Jake's demise. much has been made of the fact that the normally solid John Goodman is out of his reckoning trying to replace Belushi, but i get the feeling that was the whole point. Goodman actually nails it when he sings, but is otherwise a bit of a square peg, not sure how to carry himself off-stage. he actually knows there's a difference between his generally down-to-Earth nature and Belushi's larger-than-life mischief. it seems to me that a futile attempt to replace the irreplaceable is a conscious theme here.
which could also be said to carry over to the most notorious chink in the film's armor, the child orphan Buster. much has been made about this being an attempt to cash in on Macaulay Culkin mania (which was in fact dying down at the time), and the inadvertently saccharine quality that supposedly develops, but again, i think it was supposed to fall flat. at least outside of the music. because the kid turns out to have more than his fair share of soul upon hitting the stage. but then, he would, wouldn't he?
while we're on the subject, the musical angle got the better feedback from the critics. to the established roster, this film adds names like Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, B.B. King, Travis Tritt, Dr. John, Billy Preston, Clarence Clemons, and Gary ""U.S."" Bonds for a climactic showdown of the bands in the Bayou. a few critics even suggested bypassing the movie entirely and going strait for the soundtrack album. Roger Ebert quipped that ""with a backup band like this, Siskel and i could be The Blues Brothers.""
in short, i find it an easier film to defend than some, if not necessarily much easier to celebrate. i've often felt that genuinely cinematic catastrophes are in fact as rare as masterpieces, that as a rule of thumb, a movie is ultimately less likely to be terrible than simply unexceptional. and that's how i would characterize 2000.
this attitude toward ""bad"" movies is something that no only puzzles me at times, but sometimes even scares me a little. i mean, certainly everyone knows what it's like to look forward to a movie only to be let down by it, often having paid for the ""privilege."" but even when a film falls flat, how much harm does it really do? does it really do severe enough damage to merit our indignation?
logically, a world that remembers the names Adolf Hitler, Al Capone, and Charles Manson should be able to keep the comparatively minor sins of Michael Bay and Uwe Boll in perspective. there's a difference between a tragedy and a mere bummer, isn't there?
i'm just sayin'.",1534550400,,7155,4.715654952076678

7724836,5,B01DVALSW4,"First, let me say that anyone who expects a great plot before watching these movies clearly doesn't get it. They're not about plot, and they're really not about comedy, although they have comedic elements.

These movies are all about the music, saving it, archiving it, enjoying it for those us that grew up with it, or introducing it to those who did not. Additionally, pay close attention and you'll see blues legends like Pinetop Perkins show up in the background of other acts.

The original is simply raucous and a bit raw. They're not trying to make a Hollywood blockbuster, just having fun. The second is sweet - some may say too sweet, but the music carries it through.

Enjoy these for what they are - good fun and great music!",1530230400,,736,4.603053435114504
