8763134,5,B01GKGPY4O,"This is, by far, the best Skagit casting video I've ever watched. Tom Larimer breaks down each cast into critical parts, covers common mistakes and corrections in a language that is easy to understand. The video was recommended to me by a guide. I'm so glad I bought it!",1488153600,,270,4.530612244897959

8763136,5,B01GKGPY4O,"One of the best instructional casting film I ever seen. Tom Larimer did a great job building a knowledgeable foundation for newies  in Skagit style, as well as intermediate and advanced spey casters. I really appreciate the clear explanation in the DVD, not only ""how to"" but most ""why"". Skagit is supposed to be easy, so easy that a monkey can do it ,that may be thru, but if you wanna go a little further and master the waters  this DVD is a must",1480636800,3,448,4.321428571428571
8763137,5,B01GKGPY4O,"I found that this DVD explained many small things to me that have been overlooked in previous spey instructional videos.  While not as good as in person instruction, it is the next best thing.  While I have  six other spey instruction videos, this is the most complete one.",1473638400,3,273,4.645833333333333

8763140,5,B01GKGPY4O,"First there was Simon Gawesworth's masterwork on spey casting, where a new vocabulary of spey casting is introduced and cameos from the early skagit greats first brought them to many viewers. This piece was straightforwardly tutorial--how to learn the casts and diagnose errors. It's still a classic, but in a changing world it's now a bit dated (still taping ferrules) and tilted towards traditional spey more than fixed anchor style of casts. Given the difficulty of post-production (e.g. drawing lines over the video to help you understand) was laudably done, all round. Classy chap this Mr Gawesworth and we should all have a dram.

Then came Skagit Masters series. Thumping backbeat and personal portrayal of some of the emerging skagit gurus, an interesting blend of culture with some technique blended in, alternating across discs from documentary to instructional. Great fun to watch, new classic footage of spots never named but guessed at by many a bro, and cementing legends in their places for all who care for those things. Tutorial bits are included like scooby snacks, but as with Ed Ward's piece with apology. It's all good for those of us eager to watch every minute, but one can tell instruction wasn't the central focus that the new skagit culture seemed to be.

Larimer's new DVD: make no bones about it, this is a straightforwardly tutorial work. And it's a very good one. The production values are clearly circa 2016 with HD quality video and pro sound production. What I found quite clear was that Tom has a fully developed teaching method for Skagit, and he's obviously very well rehearsed imparting it to learners of all levels. Like Gawesworth before him he understands the value of analogy. He's been there when things have broken down, and he anticipates learners questions very well. And while all instructors have a right to a bit of their own dogma, I found Tom not drawing too deeply from this privilege. He stayed pretty middle of the road as far as this viewer can tell on instruction, with acknowledgements when his personal perspective might break with tradition. The material is arranged structurally so that a rank beginner can progress from basic skills and then return later for more advanced material where rules are teased with and perhaps broken. The physics of casting are always present as a theme to help the caster understand the why behind a particular instruction, to very good effect. The advanced material on D-loops (whether one sweeps down to up, stays level like a teacup, or otherwise shapes the loop) is to this viewers eyes a unique contribution to video instruction on this topic. There's also a good bit more on timing, anchor placement and some of the nuances that matter greatly in moving up in competency. The piece is refreshingly free of finding difference between ""spey"" vs ""skagit"" vs ""scandi"" and suggests there's more compliment than difference.

I purchased my copy from Amazon for $32 bucks. It seems to have been planned as a multi-disk set (based on Tom's references to disk 2) but they seem to have gotten it all on one disk. Sure seems a fair price and solid value to me, particularly for a rank beginner, and helpful to intermediates in need of review.

Well done, Mr. Larimer. We needed this. And for your next production I'm starting a wish list now: shaping loops into a wind/glancing wind, modifying the speed of a swing, going broadside, skating flies, and esp more mending with help on getting broadside looks and achieving depth.

ALSO COMING SOON--TRAVIS JOHNSON DVD: I learned from a recent guide trip with distance champ Travis Johnson that he will release a DVD set reasonably soon covering skagit, scandi, traditional. Having seen Travis cast, and having had his mentoring, I'm sure there'll be many gems to come on this set. Expected...I'm guessing here...xmas 2016.",1471305600,8,3854,4.941358024691358
