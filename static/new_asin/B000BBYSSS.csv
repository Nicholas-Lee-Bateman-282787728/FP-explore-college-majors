8386458,4,B000BBYSSS,"I ordered the complete 5-DVD set with the 3-DVD Hapkido. I did not receive the 3-DVD Hapkido from MasterMediaUSA. I tried to contact by the phone number they provide in the package. It does not work. I did not get an invoice that reflects my order. I received a flyer in my package. I did not receive the 3-DVD Hapkido in my package. The phone number on their flyer does not work. I phone number on their website is same on the flyer. I sent them message via Amazon.com website. They shipped my 3-DVD shortly after. The DVDs are low quality. They look like someone made them on a home computer. They played in my computer one day then stopped playing in my computer. They do play in DVD player. Now for the information on DVD. I would not consider this a ""Dirty Street Fighting"" DVD. This is more of a MMA training DVD. Adam does modify very few moves for the street. Again, very few moves are modified. This DVD is more of how to fight MMA style. Please, do not get me wrong. MMA is a great style to learn to fight. These DVD gives that information. Adam teaches how to fight standing and on the ground. Let's be real. How many of us are flexible enough to do a roundhouse kick to the head or to the ribs?  In my opinion, ""dirty street fighting"" is eye gouge, kick to knee, push soft point on throat, or spit in face. The Hapkido DVD set is a great self-defense DVD.  Steve teaches you how to break the elbow and wrist. He techniques are for if you are grabbed. He also teaches how to strike and block. The average person can learn the techniques on the Hapkido DVD. I highly highly recommend the Hapiko DVD for men, women, and children.  In short, if you want to just learn how to fight MMA style, buy the Adam Hutchin's 5-DVD only. If you want to know how to subdue your attacker with a simple turn of the wrist or arm, you must get Steve Sexton's Hapiko DVDs also. The price is worth it.",1259884800,,1891,4.232686980609419
