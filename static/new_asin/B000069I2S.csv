1734404,5,B000069I2S,"I think these workouts are wonderful! They have easy moves... the music is great... and Leslie really helps to motivate you! I would recommend this workout tape to beginners or those of us who don't like/can't do hard moves (like placing your foot above your head). I also enjoy this workout because I can do it in only 20 minutes... and if I want a harder workout, I can add simple things, like bigger arm movements, on my own! This video would probably be great for older adults too! Best of all... it inspired my faith! Leslie challenged me to take care of the body that God has given me! (Although I did not agree with her comment that there is exercise equipment in Heaven! I thought that when I got there... I would instantly become a size 4!!!)",1073692800,24,751,4.410071942446043
1734405,4,B000069I2S,"I have been doing this video almost every day for the last several weeks.  I always look forward to this fun and simple workout.  In the past I have dreaded my other workout tapes and barely gotten through them.  I have noticed that Leslie has a little trouble staying on beat at times so I just look away and keep my own pace with the music.
I am not a Christian, but do not mind the music at all.  I would recommend this tape and any of her others.",1051660800,20,450,4.022471910112359
1734406,4,B000069I2S,"I have rented Leslie Sansone walking videos from the library and really liked them.  I thought this would be a recently made walking video, so I ordered it.  This is a fine video, but it's not a walking video.  Get this only if you want a weights-optional toning video.  In this video you work on muscle strengthening, not walking.  So choose carefully.  Happy exercising!",1043798400,24,372,4.734375
1734407,4,B000069I2S,"Good points:
--can be used when weather is bad
--needs only a very small space
--not boring (Leslie is pleasing to listen to)
--can be stopped at one mile mark
--range of motion can be increased for more of a workout
--not Christian preachy
--all upright movements (no floor exercising)",1035244800,29,286,4.74

7965777,5,B000069I2S,Great walking exercise but wish it was DVD and had hip hop music or at least Christian hip hop.,1471219200,,95,4.052631578947368
7965778,3,B000069I2S,"It's probably very good, I thought I was buying DVD.",1422057600,,52,4.3
7965779,5,B000069I2S,"Leslie Sansone has developed a series of indoor ""walks"" that help burn calories. fat. and tone the body. For those of us who do not like jogging outdoors or are too busy to head to the gym, this workout is perfect. You work up a sweat and walk a 15 minute mile on either the 1 or 2 mile workout. They go quickly and are effective in helping reach your weight loss goal.",1314662400,,369,4.068493150684931
7965780,5,B000069I2S,"Easy and fun to do.  Anyone can do it, and a great price as always when ordering from Amazon.",1289088000,,93,3.8947368421052633
7965781,5,B000069I2S,"I love this exercise video! Every morning it cheers me up. I end up smiling and sweating at the same time! It has such a positive message. Best of all, I can do the work out without too much trouble. It consists of alternating walking, knee lifts, side steps and gentle kicks with the music pace starting out slow and working up to a reasonable pace. The music is inspiring.  The only negative would be that when the music switches pace, there are a few moments of awkward silence. I highly recommend this video!",1187827200,,512,4.446808510638298
7965782,2,B000069I2S,"Okay, I was disappointed with this one. I bought this specifically because the music was Christian. I figured it would inspire me to exercise more often because I love Christian music. Well, only part of the music is Christian songs that I recognize (and I know a lot of songs). Even worse, the instructional and encouraging voice-overs are so much louder than the music that the music disappears into the background. Truthfully, I've used it only 3 times since buying it months ago. On the positive side, the instructions are clear and easy to follow. This is definitely aimed at the over-50 crowd who has been sedentary. The steps are easy to follow and include arm swings and side-to-side movement as well as regular walking.",1168473600,4,728,4.832
7965783,5,B000069I2S,"My wife (60 plus) discovered Leslie through a church sponsored exercise class. Not only is it a simple yet effective workout which may be easily adjusted to various levels of fitness, but it also reminds us of our need to focus on our Spiritual health.  Leslie incorporates spiritual reminders, primarily postive and uplifting.

Really suitable for all ages, the church class is mainly seniors, but my wife has purchased 3 others for younger relatives.

And best of all, blood pressure, blood sugar and weight parameters have all improved.  On second thought not best of all - the best result has been a better focus on Him.",1126310400,6,624,4.8584905660377355
7965784,5,B000069I2S,I'M 51 YEARS OLD AND CAN NOT YET GET UP TO SPEED OF KATHY SMITH. (ALTHOUGH I HOPE ONE DAY I'LL BE ABLE TO DO ALL THE EXERCISE TAPES.) I BOUGHT THIS TAPE FIRST EVEN THOUGH I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN AND LOVED IT! MY ALL TIME FAVORITE IS EASY STRETCH WITH GREG SMITHEY TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE!!! THEN? LESLIE SANSONE'S WALK & FIRM FOR OLDER ADULTS. THEN? THIS ONE!!!,1092355200,8,357,4.042253521126761
7965785,5,B000069I2S,"I actually bought this tape for a friend who is returning to exercise after a several year lapse- but she has knee problems, so I wanted to check out the intensity and impact of this video. This is low impact, low intensity. I did this one last night- all three miles (the viewer who mentions weights is mistaken- they are referring to a different video, there are no weights in this one). I had fun, worked up a sweat, and couldn't believe I did a three mile walk! I normally do yoga (Patricia Walden), pilates (Jennifer Kries!) and I do some form of cardio everyday (Denise Austin is a fav!). I consider myself to be in great shape. But, some days you just don't want to MOVE. Some days you don't FEEL like exercising. On those days, pop this in! You will hear some lovely Christian music, listen to a motivational speaker (she goes light on the religion), and know that you MOVED and got your heart rate up.
I agree that those who do exercise regularly (me) will need to make the moves slightly bigger and more arm movements to increase intensity- but any workout can be modified. And for those who are just starting out, try the one mile, take it easy, and just see what you can do- You will be surprised at how quickly a mile passes, and how glad you will feel to know that YOU walked one MILE!
And then when you feel stronger progress to two... and then to doing all three miles at once. :-)
I like that Leslie says this workout is to help you *connect*- physicially, mentally, and *spiritually*.  I think this is going to be a great workout for my friend!",1082851200,27,1562,4.3493150684931505
