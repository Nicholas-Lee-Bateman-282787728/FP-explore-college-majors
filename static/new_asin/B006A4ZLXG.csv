8495644,5,B006A4ZLXG,"TThe style of this ""I Survived...Beyond and Back"" (all of them) are done in an excellent style of reporting.  The way the interviews were done was a style I like.  Authentic people of reasonable intelligence, that were in close-enough close-up shots so that you can read and see the emotion in their eyes,  along with the tone and the detail of how the experiences affected them and in telling what happened, was done well.  Not a lot of fluff, but tons of interest, and a down-to-earth way of filming subjects telling their experiences was an excellent way of doing such a documentary and a style that I find really interesting, and good - no fluff, just facts told in the subject's own words,  reported in an excellent manner.

I'd like to say a ""totally believable manner"", but there is barely any way NOT to believe subjects when you can read their eyes and tones, along with what they are describing.  There is NO interruptions from a reporter/interviewer, it's raw in emotion, tone, and explanation, from the actual person that went through it - and I find this series fascinating, big time, and the most hopeful thing you can have for when you are about to, or have, lost loved ones - and most especially if you are facing death yourself....which we all are one day...and THAT is an undisputable fact, no matter what you believe.",1523232000,,1336,4.659574468085107
8495645,5,B006A4ZLXG,"Three accounts of near-death experiances that leave the viewer wondering how any of them survived. All the accounts are very interesting and frankly, wonder how they are doing today. I've watched this over and over again and never grow tired of hearing their stories.",1421452800,2,267,5.090909090909091
