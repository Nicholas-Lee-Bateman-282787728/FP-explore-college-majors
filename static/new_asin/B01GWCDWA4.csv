8763886,3,B01GWCDWA4,"""La Mies es Mucha"" gets its title from the gospels. ""The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few."" Naturally this is an overly sentimental Catholic film recounting the story of a Spanish priest, Father Santiago, who arrives in India to evangelize the natives. Excited about his mission, the good priest soon finds that things are more complicated than he expected. For starters, there is a Protestant pastor competing for conversions with better resources to offer the famished locals. The priest also encounters the intrigues of the pagan religious leaders who incite the populace against his Christian mission. There is also an abusive mine owner who exploits the workers by lending them money at high interest rates, making the payback impossible. In exchange he works them to death at the mine. Father Santiago intervenes by offering to pay the workers' debt but that places him in a compromising situation since he doesn't have that kind of money either. Things get tougher and tougher for the priest, including a plague breakout, but he faces all challenges with saintly patience and daring heroics.

In spite of the Catholic propaganda and a dull black and white cinematography, veteran director Saenz de Heredia manages to keep things moving. That, and some fine acting by all, especially Fernando Fernn Gmez as the priest, makes the film viewable. Sarita Montiel? Don't expect to see much of her since she only shows up a couple of times, in spite of being credited as one of starring players. The film has not been restored so the DVD quality in video and audio is mediocre. Over all I do not recommend this drab film unless you are interested in the subject matter.",1499212800,,1681,4.939929328621908
