8346619,1,B001VLFEBW,"this is horrrrrible! my daughter LOVES anything to do with Peter Pan and Captain Hook (she's 2) but this couldn't even keep her attention for a moment, much less mine. I always liked the movie (the original that is) but this is soo incredibly slow that it won't keep any child entertained for any period of time. it's just very dull and (unless you've just never seen the original) the artwork is a bit poor. Sorry, if you do like it.",1322352000,,434,4.37037037037037
