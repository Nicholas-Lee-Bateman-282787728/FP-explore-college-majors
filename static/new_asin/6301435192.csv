Its not really scary nevertheless there are some  shocking moments which are quite enjoyable.  One of the best vampire films  around.  It would definitely be great in DVD.",956880000,,336,4.706896551724138

While it is lacking in the special features of a Scream Factory release, getting to see this movie in the correct aspect ratio and cleaned up for HD was worth it.",1504310400,5,294,4.345454545454546
330615,5,6301435192,"Following in writer/director Tom Hollands (Childs Play, The Temp, Thinner, Fright Night) footsteps, director Tommy Lee Wallace (Halloween III: Season of the Witch, It) has some big shoes to fill.  And you know what? I think he did a great job!

After years of therapy, Charley (William Ragsdale; Fright Night, The Reaping) has come to believe that his entire vampire experience was all a delusion since, of course, vampires don't exist.  So when Regines fanged coven comes for him, his girlfriend Alex (Traci Lind; Class of 1999, Spellcaster) and Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall; Embryo, Shakma, Fright Night) must come to his aid.

Led by the sultry Regine (Julie Carmen; In the Mouth of Madness), Bozworth (Brian Thompson; The Terminator, Alien Nation, Nightwish), Louie (Jon Gries; TerrorVision, The Monster Squad) and Belle (Russell Clark; choreographer from Vamp) round out her vampiric team seeking revenge against Charley Brewster for killing her brother, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon in Fright Night).

Belle is a roller-skating vampire of other-worldly androgyny (a perfect 80s vamp), Bozworth knows the taxonomy of every insect he ghoulishly eats with delight, Louie is strikingly werewolf-like (much like Evil Ed), and Regine is a walking sex pot with long sexy fangs. Its clear that Tommy Lee Wallace is modeling this evil crew after Tom Hollands, but thats just fine with me. Each character has some parallels to their 1985 models, but all stand out as interesting and different.

Part 1s tone is also largely preserved as everything is still quite sexualized and often humorous. I cant help but to feel that this sequel is a bit more silly (or just sort of out there) and just a tad less effective, however it remains a very entertaining favorite.  It has injected a bit more 80s-ness and an enhanced sense of dramatic flair.

The special effects likewise parallel the original and, despite having a lower budget, the special effects are somewhat comparable to part 1.  I especially enjoyed Louies wolfish bat hybrid make-up and Bozworths entomological death was also a guilty pleasure. The melting death scenes lacked the delicious gooiness and lengthy elaboration of part 1s, but I must say I was thrilled with the finale death and Regines creature effects (as a gargoyle-like bat hybrid and later like some skinless menace out of Hellraiser).  It seemed that the lower budget didn't noticeably hinder this effects team too muchbut it did shorten the effects scenes and how much time we spend seeing monster make-up on screen (e.g., Jerrys various stages of vampiric transformation in part 1 got loads of screen time).

In this sequel, we find Charley in a similar situation to his last girlfriend (in 1985). Charleys exposure to Regine results in some symptoms like light sensitivitymuch as we observed in My Best Friend is a Vampire or The Lost Boys, both from 1987 and both of which were clearly influenced heavily by Fright Night (1985). I guess the influence has come full circle.  The sexy dance of seduction scene (now with Charley) is done in a manner much more classical to the vampire genre.  Fright Night (1985) did this in quite the raunchy manner.

I remain VERY pleased with both the original and this sequel.  The original had more charm (perhaps stemming from its originality), and this sequel feels more sleek and stylish.  Both really went for it and they remain gratifying even today, 30 years after they were made!",1502064000,,3451,5.038664323374341

330647,4,6301435192,"Fright Night 2 is a fairly good sequel to the original 1985 movie.

This movie stars two original actors - Roddy Mcdowall and William Ragsdale. Roddy Mcdowall was such a good actor.

This movie is about Jerry Dandrige's sister seeking revenge on both Charlie and Mr Vincent for killing her brother.

With an excellent soundtrack and good acting. This movie was very good. It's a shame the dude who played Evil refused to return to make this movie. They say it's what could have made his career do a lot better. I loved Evil in the first movie.",1478217600,,543,4.520408163265306
330648,4,6301435192,"Even though the original Fright Night (1985) is unequivocally one of my favorite 80's horror flicks, I had no idea there even was a sequel until I came across it on a certain internet site for the free viewing of videos  (we all know which one), and decided it might be worth a look, if only because this was a vampire movie I actually had not seen. I do not place much stock in sequels, so really expected very little.

Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the horror movie host cum vampire slayer and the now college aged Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) are back, and find themselves in a similar situation as they did the first time around. On that note, it paid homage to, but never tried to be a carbon copy of Fright Night. Charley, who has been seeing a psychiatrist after the events of the first movie, is convinced that vampires are but a figment of his imagination, and after his last session comes to a close, decides to pay a call on his old friend with his very lovely new girlfriend, Alex, played exceptionally well by Traci Lind, who is thankfully not the shrieking beauty cliche from a thousand other movies in this vein. Unable to admit he believes the incidents they went through had anything to do with the supernatural, Charley leaves Peter Vincent's apartment with his feet firmly on the ground.

That is, until he notices some very peculiar new neighbors move into the same building as he is leaving...

With a gothic flair I've yet to see much of from the era, Fright Night II had its share of creepy, suspenseful moments, and proved itself a worthy successor. It borrowed heavily from Dracula with its elements of vampire lore, and really worked well as a modernized version. Good and evil were clearly defined, and make no mistake, these creatures of the night were not intended to be sympathetic. I won't go so far as saying it was better than the first, because it wasn't, but this is one underrated vampire film. And in my opinion, one of the better movies in the genre.",1467504000,,1997,4.569832402234637

I am proud to have this in my collection.  I remember renting this from my local video store several times cause me and my brother loved it.  The DVD version of the film is now a out of print and very pricey so if you plan on buying this then be careful cause the DVD will run you up more.  The VHS is just as good and less pricey.  If you loved the original Fright Night then the second installment will make you love Fright Night even more.  Good script, Fiedel's music is amazing, and Peter Vincent rocks!

330874,3,6301435192,"The nightmare isn't over for Charley Brewseter, who is now in college after defeating the evil vampire next door just a few years earlier. Now, the beautiful vampiress Regine and her fiendish entourage have arrived seeking revenge against those responsible for her brother's death! William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall return for another spooky adventure care of the talented Tommy Lee Wallace, who steps in to direct for series creator Tom Holland. Wallace gives us many more ambitious and atmospheric moments, including a werewolf's vertical ascent up the dormitory wall, several swooping crane shots from the wings of the bat, Regine's swirling appearance out of the mist in Charley's dorm room, and the grand entrance into Regine's lair that is suddenly lit by hundreds of candles. These touches keep with the Gothic traditions of the original FRIGHT NIGHT, but are updated with more modern make-up and special effects. This is where the lower budget is most evident, however, since the costumes fall slightly behind the incredible work that was shown before. Julie Carmen is dark and mysterious as the temptress Regine, although she does not have quite the presence as her toothy counterpart, Chris Sarandon. Unfortunately, Roddy McDowall is given few moments to shine this second time around, as his character simply goes through the same motions as he had in the first film. Jon Gries, Brian Thompson, and Russell Clark, on the other hand, provide memorable bits playing Regine's evil cohorts. FRIGHT NIGHT 2 strays very little from the formula laid out in the original, but it is still an enjoyable sequel that is sure to appease fans of the series.

Regine Dandridge (played by Julie Carman) is the sister of Jerry (From Fright Night 1),seems to be a beautiful woman with a thirst of blood and a seduction to men. She later seduces Charlie and eventually manages to turn him a vampire too and has to fighte his inner montrous demons, just to kill Regine and her other  monstrous friends.

Here's the link...

stores.classic-movies-direct.net/-strse-11/Fright-Night-II-%281988%29/Detail.bok

I don't want anyone to lose business but wanting a price like that isn't gonna help either, if I had a case of these DVDs I would sell them for $15 a piece and when they were gone that would be the end of the sale duh....but I understand why they are this much because its rare and is not in print anymore.  I am not sure how many they have in stock so hurry up and check it out.

Now to the review...Fright Night 2 stayed very true to the 1st part.  Except for not bringing back Amanda Bearse to reprise the role of Amy.  Also they could not have made a better selection casting Julie Carmen as Regine Dandridge.  She fit this role so well, she literally mesmerizes every guy in the audience.

Well hopefully since the remake will be out they will put Fright Night 1 & 2 in a set and it won't be $100 to get it.  Even though I did buy this from the link above I would definitely have to acquire the set if they ever should choose to release it.",1305331200,,1372,4.341176470588235

330992,3,6301435192,"William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall return for more vampire slaying craziness in ""Fright Night: Part 2."" Taking place three years after the events of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-film/dp/0767817664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first film</a>, the sequel finds Charley Brewster a little older and a little wiser. Thanks to some therapy, Charley no longer believes in vampires and is trying his hardest to move on with his life, which includes his college studies, a new love interest (Traci Lind) clinging to his side and a gnarly mullet to boot. Unfortunately, just as things start getting back on track for our hero, a gang of vampires comes to town seeking food, a good time, and some good old fashioned vengeance. It's up to Charley and the down-on-his-luck Peter Vincent to once again put a stop to the madness.

Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-III-Season-Of-The-Witch/dp/B0000AOX09/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween III - Season Of The Witch</a>""), ""Fright Night: Part 2"" is somewhat lacking in the charming spirit of the original. While Wallace (a John Carpenter protg) puts on a good show with the aid of a fog machine and an excellent score by the great Brad Fiedel in tow, the film can't help but succumb to sequelitis. While the character of Charley may have moved on, his routine certainly hasn't. Even though the film makes an effort to not repeat the events of the first film, it can't help but slip into redundancy with a ""been there, done that"" vibe running throughout. It also doesn't help that this new gaggle of baddies lack the charisma of Chris Sarandon and come across as less of a threat than they do a cast of rejects from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video.

It's not all bad for this sequel, though. On the plus side, Wallace keeps the pace quick and easy. Reuniting with characters from the original film is a treat and it's nice to see their characters expanded upon as well. Both Ragsdale and McDowall are on their game and it shows in the final product as the two whole-heartedly carry the film. Traci Lind makes for a slightly less interesting love interest than Amanda Bearse in the original, but has a likable energy about her that makes one wonder why her career never took off. All in all, ""Fright Night: Part 2"" is an enjoyable if flawed re-entry into familiar territory. It might not have the same ""bite"" as the original, but it's certainly not one of the worst sequels of its era either.

Side note: Beware of the Artisan DVD. It is a bare-bones release which is nothing more than a transfer from a VHS source. It's not in its original widescreen presentation and looks and sounds like garbage. Hopefully someday in the future another company will get it right and release it in all of its glory on Blu-Ray/DVD, but for now, this is unfortunately as good as it gets.",1294790400,2,2940,5.120833333333334

Monsters HD (part of the Voom HD channel suite that USED to be carried on Dish Network but sadly Dish dropped Voom 5/2008) just got Fright Night II transferred over to HD from the original negative and that usually means that a spiffy DVD release may not be to far around the bend.

Seriously, this is fun flick with some cool make up effects and comedic gags; enough for any vampire movie lover to sink their fangs into. If you like 80s horror films than this is a MUST see.

I am just hoping for a nice wide screen transfer of the film with a 5.1 DD sound track. Is that too much to ask for? Some extras like commentary and or cast interviews would be swell too.

The Artisan DVD release from a few years ago was a joke. I remember running out to get this and was floored at the awful picture quality; honestly it is no better than a standard VHS picture. I held on to the DVD and sold it on ebay last year for 60.00 to some poor buyer in dire need of the DVD. I am not sure how Artisan can live with itself after such a dreadful release on DVD. I say off with their heads (j/k)!

331035,5,6301435192,"First of all, both the Fright Night flicks are among some of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. They both rank up there with Salem's Lot, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Lost Boys, and many others. The only problem with Fright Night 2 is the DVD release by Artisan. The first Fright Night was released by Columbia TriStar and was a flipper disc. Although there were little to no extras on that disc the movie still had a great anamorphic widescreen transfer that still holds up. Fright Night 2 should also have gotten that but NO it didn't. Artisan treated this worthy sequel with no respect whatsoever. Despite the crimes that Artisan committed, I hope that Lionsgate rereleases the movie with a anamorphic widescreen transfer in its original aspect ratio with some good extras too. The first Fright Night should get rereleased too in a better edition. The 25th Anniversary of Fright Night is coming in two years so be prepared for it hopefully. Fright Night 2 hopefully will be released again by then The extras alone would make both of these films worth picking up.

Charlie has now moved onto college and has gotten a new girlfriend named Alex. Here he is receiving counseling with a Dr. who's trying to convince him Vampires do not exist... During this time, he begins to undergo hypnosis.

Soon after, Charlie ends up meeting a seductress who has a deadly taste for things warm and red and she seems to know a little too much about Charlie.. Then one night she ends up coming to his room, seduces him and bites him on the neck.

After dreaming of her nightly and seeing her everywhere, Soon the seductress's identity is revealed along with her mysterious group of friends. At this point things finally begin to make sense for Charlie.

Charlie's girlfriend Alex is now starting to believe that the Vampires may actually be real and not in Charlie's imagination.

Charlie's relationships with his friend and new girlfriend begin to become broken. Charlie refuses to believe he's now a Vampire and his friends and girlfriend have to try to save him before it's too late.

There are some unanswered questions in this film- You don't get to know what happened to Amy, Charlie's first girlfriend, along with other slight disapointments.

Even though it wasn't very scary, the movie still has some pretty good special effects, decent body count, comedic thrills and good acting.  The film was directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, the same man who directed Halloween 3.

331067,5,6301435192,"Usually the ""unplanned"" sequel of a hit movie suck inasmuch as the producers found an unexpected hit and try to shake the money tree for a bit more.

This is not true for Fright Night part 2. The sequel (based on the surprise hit of 1985) has a well thought out and believably based plot (at least for a vampire tale) and story line. In this case Regine is looking for vengeance in the destruction of her brother Jerry Dandridge in the previous film. She plans to exact this by turning Charlie Brewster (now in college) into a vampire himself and torturing him through eternity. While she reserves Charlie for herself, she has a troupe of other beasties and baddies which follow her around and generally cause mayhem wherever they go. These provide mostly for comic relief. The male sidekick catches bugs and just before devouring them gives the scientific name for each. Others may not appreciate the inserted humor, but I found that it added to the story. Sort of like the creator saying, ""Hey, this is just make believe, let's have some fun"". My favorite was the young guy w/ the sideburns who plays a hip vampire and tries to `make it' with Charlie's new girlfriend, Alex. One feels that he just recently became one of the undead and still wants to savor the life he once had (in a very clumsy way). Another reviewer says he came off as a dork. I personally think this is the impression he was intended to give.

Julie Carmen gave a very nice performance as Regime. And of course, we have Roddy McDowell back as Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer. Once again, director Tommy Lee Wallace has done wonders with the effects and make-up.

Others have commented on the generally poor quality of the DVD by Artisan. I am re-watching the disc now and do not consider the picture grainy or dark. Quality seems to be on par with most other DVD's I've seen (and I've seen a bunch of 'em). True, the DVD lacks any extras and the picture is full screen; but that is not a primary consideration in the quality of the product so far as I am concerned. The music that accompanies is haunting and appropriate.

All things given, I believe that fans of the original Fright Night will definitely enjoy this unsung gem. Maybe not an academy award winner for horror flicks, but certainly entertaining and worth having in any gothic horror collection.

There is a great scene with Gries, Clark and Thompson bowling, including using the head of the bowling alley manager as a ball.

This is one case of the sequel living up to the original and passing it at times. My VCR had become grainy and faded, which is why I give this only 4 stars.

The movie is nothing new in the vampire movies, but i still love it. The reason being is Regine. She is probably one of the hottest vampires ive seen next to Kate Beckinsale in ""Underworld"". Regine is basically a dream woman of mine. I know I sound like a babbaling teen, but I just think she is beautiful.

I love the music in the movie too. Im basically a Metal and hard rock fan, but when i hear 80's music like this, I have a soft spot for it.

The only thing I don't like about the movie is that transvestite vampire. Belle or whatever. i don't know if its a boy or a girl and it kinda erks me. Ha

So basically i love this movie because its a nestolgic journey for me. The Vampire is sexy, and the whole thing of charley becoming a vampire is a good turn from the first movie.

Jerry Dandridge's sister is here to take revenge of Charlie and Peter Vincent for killing her 1,000 year-old brother.  The way she went about it was different (for a pleasant change): She seduces Charlie and it's up to Vincent and Amy to save him.

Good special effects and seductive storyline make this a pleasurable viewing experience.  Also good to have for the library, too (although I like DVDs and the Special Features section of them, I prefer good ol' VHS tapes).

331074,3,6301435192,"Counseling has convinced Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale)--the hero from the smash flick FRIGHT NIGHT (1985)--that vampires don't exist and that he and his friend, TV horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), didn't actually kill one.  But Charley has a ""relapse"" when he notices that a new tenant in Peter's apartment building is moving in with a lot of coffins and other trappings of the bloodsucking lifestyle.

Not nearly as clever nor as slick as its predecessor, FRIGHT NIGHT PART II is still an entertaining vampire flick that will please fans of the vampire sub-genre and should delight fans of the original.  Most of the elements that made the first flick a success are still there--the rapport between Charley and Peter Vincent; a damsel in distress; an alluring and powerful vampire (this time played by Julie Carmen); tongue-in-cheek and off-beat humor; and cool special FX.  Noticeably missing is Charley's best-friend-turned-vamp Evil Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys), who was the delightfully over-the-top comic relief in the first flick.  While actor Jon Gries does a pretty good job as the scary but comical character in FRIGHT NIGHT PART II, he just can't fully fill the shoes of the quirky Geoffreys.  Still, FRIGHT NIGHT PART II does offer some chills and surprises, and as horror sequels go, it is top-notch and delivers the goods that fans desire.

That's the good news.  Now for the bad.

The DVD from Artisan (Lionsgate/Fox) is a bit disappointing, mainly due to two factors.  First off, the film is offered in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  While some sources indicate that this is the format in which the film was originally shot, other sources indicate that the original aspect ratio was 2.35:1.  Even if the film was shot in what is traditionally called the ""full-screen"" format, the film was presented in a ""matted"" widescreen format for its original theatrical release, indicating that this was the form in which film's creators intended for the film to be viewed.  Thus, a widescreen presentation on DVD is mandatory as far as true film fans and cinematic purists are concerned, and Artisan should be ashamed of their reformatted digital offering.  Secondly, the digital transfer of the film is grainy and several filmic artifacts are noticeable.  The blurry quality caused by the graininess almost makes it seem as if the transfer was made from video tape rather than celluloid, and this is frankly unacceptable quality for the digital age.  And on top of all this, the disc offers absolutely nothing by way of bonus material.

In short, FRIGHT NIGHT PART II is a fun and entertaining film that is remarkably high quality for a horror sequel.  However, the DVD from Artisan (Lionsgate/Fox) leaves a lot to be desired in terms of offerings and quality.  Alone, the film deserves a four-star rating.  But taking the overall quality of the disc into consideration, this DVD gets three stars.",1099180800,4,2917,5.0375

Bride of Re-Animator, Waxwork, and Lair of the White Worm were disappointents because of the poor picture quality, no widescreen formats, and lack of supplemental material, but Fright Night Part II takes the cake as their worst release!

So, Brewster enlists the help of fearless vampire killer Peter Vincent (the late-great Roddy McDowal) land they're off to do battle once gain.
While not nearly as good as the original, FRIGHT NIGHT II is a lot of fun. As a matter of fact this maybe the only horror sequel not totally trashed by director Tommy Lee Wallace who trashed HALLOWEEN III years earlier and VAMPIRES: LOS MUERTOS years later.  This sequel is full of effective humor and horror none of which however live up to anything in the first movie. That's understandable though. The first FRIGHT NIGHT is a classic as far as vampire genre pictures go and it's always hard to follow in the footsteps of that. So if you're a fan of the first movie or just a fan of the good old fashioned horror comedy then give FRIGHT NIGHT II a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Like in the first one, Amy had until dawn before she was fully changed, but good ole' Charlie went through it for days... And I didn't really like the werewolf-like vampire.

You will notice this film was made by a different company, the film is lower budget, the film is grainy, not many classical artsy close-ups and the story is bland.  But William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall manage to keep it afloat. If you are a die-hard fan of Fright Night (1985), then I would recommend Fright Night Part II.  But you'll feel something is missing, and that my friend is the sensational Amanda Bearse and the energetic Stephen Geoffreys.  This DVD contains no extras or bonuses.

It did manage to retain some of the the charm of the original, but the surprises are a little worn.  The introduction of new creatures is welcome, along with a new vampire, but they seemed a little too Euro-trashy and not as menacing to me.  The story is fairly the same, with some minor changes, which was a little disappointing as I was hoping for a little more originality, being the optimist that I am....
As far as the presentation of the movie on this DVD, it is very poor.  I am unsure if there was a widescreen version of this movie, but I did notice some cropping, panning and scanning which may suggest that this was originally released in a different format.  The picture is at times fuzzy, grainy, and generally pretty poor all around.  The sound is a little better.  There are no extras, not even a token trailer.  If you own this movie on VHS, do not bother buying this release, as it's virtually the same quality.  Didn't appear if any effort what so ever was put into this release, which is too bad, as it deserved better.

I own over 150 DVD's and I've never come across such a sad excuse for a DVD.  The picture quality is HORRIBLE!  If you look closely, you can see that it was taken from a tape source, and not the original.  Plus, Artisan claims on the back of the box that it is formatted from its ""original"" aspect ratio, and that it was shot in full screen.  That is a blatant lie.  It was shot in letterbox widescreen, just as the first film was.  You can even tell when you watch it that it has been cropped to death, and at certain moments the screen moves from right to left to catch what's missing.  The audio is 2.0 Dolby surround, which is fine.  However, when you turn the volume up to hear the more quiet parts of the film, you hear tape hiss.  Beware of Artisan releases on DVD.  Their transfers are usually like this.  I have a few other older films released by them, and they're pretty poor in the quality department.  It is a great film however, and is worth having no matter what.  I guess this DVD is better than not having it...Almost.",1061596800,65,1173,4.2207207207207205
331146,2,6301435192,"Fright Night Part II is, IMO, very nearly the equal of the first movie, which itself is my favorite horror film of all time.  That said, I have been waiting for a few years (ever since the release of the first FN film by Columbia TriStar in '99) for Part II to become available on DVD.
I'm not disappointed that the presentation is full-frame, 1.33:1, as from what I understand, the film was originally shot in this aspect ratio.  I'm not even disappointed that there aren't any extras to speak of (extras being rare for any sequel DVD, really).
No, the problem lies with the ABOMINABLE transfer.  The movie seems to have been mastered directly from whatever print Vista had lying around--it's very grainy and looks about the same, or perhaps slightly worse than, an SP speed VHS copy.  For DVD, it's absolutely hideous.  Artisan should know better than to release such product without at least attempting a remastering which would have tightened up the picture and made it worth the DVD release (look at the 2 films' DVD releases side-by-side...nothing to compare!).
If you're a Fright Night completist or just really really like the movie, buy this DVD.  It'll keep your VHS copy (you know you have one!) from withering away.  Don't buy the disc looking to be wowed by the digital format, you'll disappoint yourself (I did).

331151,5,6301435192,"After dealing with one cast of vampires, you'd think that a person would have had enough excitement to last a lifetime, right? Well, in the case of Peter Vincent - Vampire Killer, and Charlie Bruster - Vampire Killer Admirer, you'd be right, but there's a little problem with that. When you find yourself entangled with one of a multiple undying brood, it can only be the beginning of a very long, very endearing nightmare. After finding himself in therapy for three years after his little ""outing"" with Jerry Dandridge, Charlie thinks himself cured of all his ailments. The delusions that led him to believe that Jerry was indeed a vampire and that group hypnosis that made he and Peter see the same things confirmed that fact, they have all been explained away and now he's on the road to recovery.  On this highway of discovery, he has forged himself a new life, taking on a newer, lovelier, girlfriend and finding that he now has something to look forward to besides thoughts of a high school mind and a bloodsucking neighbor living next door. Yes, he seems to have so much to look forward to. Unfortunately for him, in this series of newness, he has other things to look forward to, namely new vampiric admirers as well. And that type, well, they are the kind you never want to find.
Before looking over both Fright Night and its sequel, Fright Night 2, one has to remember that (1) sequels are rarely the original in form and effect and (2) it is an odd event when the 2nd chapter in a series is anywhere near the first. The reason I say this is not to make excuses for the movie, however, but to say that this entry, it is an abnormality in the world of potential failures. Yes, in the case of Fright Night 2, there is a strange exception to that ruling on sequels because the movie is both commendable and it does hold its own in an arena clogged with many forms of disposable outings. In it, the theme of revenge is one that reigns supreme, with someone from Charlie and Peter's past, namely Dandridge, surfacing once more - but in a rather twisted manner. His revenge, it isn't in the atypical ""defying death"" arena that most films give you, but rather in the sense of having friends and family that live forever and those individuals taking it rather seriously when one of their own is ""dealt with.""  This is something that is welcome, a cast of faces that isn't the same person returning and being banished once more, and the methods they wish to adopt, while primed with ways to fail, are ones that are delightful. The original actors return in the starring roles, too, making things easy to keep up with, and the prosthetic effects are some of the better portions from the array of movies that flocked to the screen at the time. When you take all of that, blend it together, and think that vampires are going to run amok in a film that makes fun of films with vampires while using them, then you have a wonderful combination to the safe called ""comedy.""
For anyone that missed the movie, enjoys the campiness that vampire films carry from that time frame, appreciates good effects alongside their vengeful motives, and is willing to find it on VHS (it has yet to make its way to DVD), then this would be something worth checking into. This is especially true for those who liked the first film and wanted to find it carrying on, with the unfortunately loss of everyone's favorite character; Evil. It has many things to offer in the sharpness of wit and whittled wood.",1053734400,4,3481,4.54140127388535

Julie Carmen is solid and sexy as the head vampire and sister to the great Jerry Dandridge from the first Fright Night played masterfully by Chris Sarandon. Tommy Lee Wallace directs what's probably his best film with Fright Night 2 and makes one hell of a great and faithful follow up to the original classic. This is a must see while it's available to view on amazon streaming especially due to the unfortunate rarity of this film. Here's hoping Fright Night Part 2 will finally get a terrific blu ray release very soon.",1515974400,6,960,4.824242424242424
