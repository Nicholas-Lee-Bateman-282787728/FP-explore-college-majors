6679688,4,B00NT962DI,Good movie. Its definitely a B scary movie but worth watching if you are into those. Along the lines of  The Hills Have Eyes.,1421539200,,125,4.208333333333333

6679690,2,B00NT962DI,"Two couples  traveling cross country opt to take in the sights via a rural road. When they stop to see the ""Elvis Rock"" their vehicle gets stolen and they are at the mercy of the locals of Spaulding, most likely a town named for Captain Spaulding.

Fight, kill, tie-up, escape. kill, get re-captured, fight kill, etc . We have seen these  types before and done better. The characters in this film are bland  Might be better off getting the 40th anniversary edition of TCM and watching it again.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, attempted rape.  No nudity.",1414540800,6,543,4.663157894736842

6679696,5,B00NT962DI,"Side-splitting comedy meets feeble attempt at horror - I bought this movie thinking it might be terrifying...what I got was a collection of bloopers and boners that would put the late Benny Hill to shame!!!  In fact, if you want to REALLY enjoy this movie, loop the Benny Hill theme song and let the hilarity ensue!

I think they actually meant for this movie to be scary...I'm uncertain...but it isn't.  It's knee-slappingly funny, from the idiotic dialogue to the weapons-grade stupidly stereotyped characters.  I was expecting horror, but honestly, I laughed so hard I couldn't, in good conscience, give this vid any less than the full five-star treatment...

It's well worth the money as a comedy with random gore thrown in...as a horror flick...you might want to look elsewhere.

If you do decide to watch it, be prepared...to LAUGH LIKE HELL!!!",1454976000,,850,4.99290780141844

6679705,2,B00NT962DI,Looked interesting and the premise was unique.  However the acting was not good at all and it reminded me more of a 70s exploitation flick for a drive in theater.,1438819200,2,162,4.4
6679706,1,B00NT962DI,"I had to turn this one off. It's just too ridiculous. The acting is horrendous and the characters are written to be dumber than a dump truck. The captives had SEVERAL chances to up their odds of survival by just by picking up guns that had been dropped but instead, walked away and chose to try their luck at vein UNARMED? It was infuriating to watch. I mean, I'm not a big gamer, but EVERYONE knows that if you kill someone in a game, you take his gun.c'mon.",1438560000,2,459,4.2272727272727275

6679712,1,B00NT962DI,"I have to question why in the world is this piece of s*** film is even being shown. Unless you're into ""Fail"" rated movies, this is an utter waste of time. Maybe if you were on LSD or Meth, it might be appealing where you can't even grasp how truly bad this is. I question the persons that rated this as a good film, they might have played a role in it and want their royalties to go up.",1429315200,4,387,3.911392405063291

6679719,3,B00NT962DI,"This is tailor-made for MST3K. I had fun joking on it (beer helped a lot), but feel bad for anyone looking for anything approaching a real horror movie. Then again, when was the last time we had a good horror movie? Epic drinking games could be based on this, but, regardless, I'm pretty sure there was some kind of nepotism going on in the production of this WTF endeavor. Or someone left there DSLR laying around with 50% battery available. Enjoy. (Full disclosure - I was given this movie freely through Amazon Prime membership). It's the gift that keeps on giving.",1423958400,,568,4.633663366336633
6679720,4,B00NT962DI,"This is a pretty good movie, especially when you know what to expect. the film has a lot of great acting, camera work, and violence, but it's not completely horror. it's not completely action, either. it's the perfect mix of both and will satisfy a lot of different audience preferences in one viewing. it's definitely worth the price of DVD or instant video rental. give it a... shot.",1422576000,2,385,4.676470588235294
8680047,3,B00NT962DI,"Honestly, I thought this was a pretty good piece of work, could have been way better if they had written it a bit different but I've seen so many homemade and low budget movies on here and netflix and youtube that are ultra pathetic. There was some decent acting in this. All it takes is to make you forget about things and wonder what's going to happen next, then you know the acting isn't too bad, it's something J-lo or chris pratt will never be able to do, or about 96% of the homemade movies on here and netflix, they just seem like someone reading lines or trying to act, they don't make you just get into it wondering what is going to happen.
