This series of CDs has so much great content that it will super-charge your flame and get you onto the paths that we are supposed to trailblaze! My father got my brothers and I to listen to Tony Robbins when we were kiddos on cassette tape. It's been like 20+ years and I stumbled upon a YouTube video of him that got me back into him. So I purchased this set from a very reputable vendor on Amazon and have been listening over and over. This stuff is gold and no matter what your goals are, this will get you closer. Forever forward!",1357344000,3,643,4.193548387096774
2743135,5,B000MRBBNG,"This is the third program from Robbins that I have tried and it gets results.
There was a few new things that I wasn't able to try this winter.  But I am
excited to do the program again in the fall and see its full results.",1342396800,2,223,3.847826086956522
2743136,5,B000MRBBNG,"Tony has changed the way I handle life, when my supervisor communicate with me now, I ask him for some clarification and please make sure you have all your facts before you come to a conclusion,  and that one thing stops him in his tracks!

8171357,1,B000MRBBNG,WRONG PRODUCT! MISSING 7 DVDs! ONLY A DVD ADVERTISING ABOUT THE 7 DAYS.,1480118400,,71,4.538461538461538
8171358,1,B000MRBBNG,"Advertised as transforming your life: emotion, relationships, health, finance. In reality, it is a poorly-produced discussion about exercise. Features Tony Robbins from about 20 years ago. AVOID THIS.",1469750400,,200,6.178571428571429
8171359,1,B000MRBBNG,"BEWARE... not what you think it is!! I love Tony Robbins life-changing ideas... BUT... this DVD is NOT what it appears to be! It is ONLY one DVD about a muscle buidling approach of using huge amounts of weight to statically hold the position to build muscle. i have looked into it and at best... it is controversial as an effective approach. This video is NOT about 'transforming your life"" in a broader way. The cover says, ""7 Days to Transform Your Life... emotions, relationships, health, finances"" This is NOT what the DVD is about. The seller on Amazon is misleading everyone as to what the topic is on the DVD. So Do not buy this!

UPDATE: the seller did refund my money on the item so i am pleased they did that without any hassle! thanks!",1441238400,5,746,4.445255474452555

8171363,3,B000MRBBNG,"I like Tony Robbins but am disappointed in this product as it is an infomercial describing how to get the most out of his ""Get The Edge"" CD set.  I bought it used very cheap but feel it was still a waste of money.",1360886400,3,213,3.840909090909091
