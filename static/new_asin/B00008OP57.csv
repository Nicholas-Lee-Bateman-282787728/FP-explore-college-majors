1856700,4,B00008OP57,"Rekha is magnificent! Ever since I first saw her in ""Koi Mil Gaya"" she's hooked me. She's a consummate actress, great dancer, and her beauty to this day is something to dazzle the eye. I am a Rekha fan. This and Sasila are usually sited as her most famous roles now, and she's fabulous in both, but this movie has a MAJOR issue... I'm sorry to say, it has no script!

Now don't get me wrong there are plenty of films out there that entertain without great scripts. Dhoom 2, the entire ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, etc. But this isn't supposed to be mindless popcorn fare, so it really needed a script! Unfortunately we get some lovely poetic dialogue and a series of events that wash over our leading lady with no coherent narrative or character development. I ask you, how can this be?

Umaro Jaan is based on a novel by Mirza Muhammad Hadi Rusva, considered one of the first true Urdu Novels. I have to put it on my reading list because I can't believe the novel was written in this format.

But despite the fact that the ""story"" is put together as a series of disconnected unfortunate events I still think it's worth buying and watching. Why? The actors are extremely good at what they do! While character development is pretty much non-existent, (everyone stays exactly as they were from beginning to end) they all effortlessly convey the emotions they need to at the time. The lovers love convincingly, the haters hate convincingly, the heartbreak feels genuine, and there aren't any manipulations for the audiences feelings.

The dances are devine! Rekha is grace, poise, and charm. She knows when to seduce and when to be modest. She is genuine every step of the way.

This isn't the most beautiful Bollywood movie you'll ever see, but you don't really pay too much attention because your eyes are always on the heroine.

All in all, this movie wasn't a huge hit when it premiered, and I can understand why. I can also understand why it became a cult favorite when the leading lady attained superstardom. You really only need one reason to see it, the incomparable Rekha.",1384473600,4,2079,4.635869565217392
1856701,1,B00008OP57,"I loved the Aishwarya Rai version and then the manager of an Indian restaurant I frequent said this version is superior. This is a masterpiece ruined by a horrible video transfer to DVD. The color is washed out and the video has low resolution and is blurry at times. The picture quality is worse at times than an unrestored 1920's silent film. The key songs, which are hauntingly beautiful lack subtitles and the editing is brutal at times. What a shame since Rekha is a perfect Umrao Jaan. This film deserves to be restored. I paid $2.33 + shipping....it is not worth much more than that.",1379289600,3,590,4.5754716981132075

Returned for a refund",1374537600,,113,4.428571428571429
1856703,3,B00008OP57,"I hoped to receive the Original ""Umrao Jaan"" since I've seen the newer one and heard countless viewers claim it didn't do the Original much justice. I guess I will continue looking for the Original version, but the price I paid for the DVD received was good and it plays with ease and clarity; no scratches or skips. Thanks!",1358640000,,324,4.508474576271187

7986071,5,B00008OP57,"A real life story at times even possible in today's world. Movie based on the olden life and the producers have done all to bring the best out of this production of Music and Drama. I came across the performance of Rekha for the first time in the movie Rampur Ka Laxman and very many  have since been produced to include this movie star. Costumes, jewellery and decorations have been remarkable as are the Ghazals and the songs for the family entertainment.",1483401600,,457,4.573170731707317

7986075,5,B00008OP57,"I watched this movie a year ago and just jad to have it. All of the actors give wonderful performances, but Rekha steals the show with her excellent dancing skills and bewitching expressions. She is both captivating and compelling.",1428278400,,231,4.948717948717949

7986079,1,B00008OP57,"I decided to purchase this movie, since I had recently seen an exhibition on the art and culture of Lucknow at Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Arts (LACMA). Unfortunately, I did not receive what I had ordered. The title of the product that I had ordered says ""Umrao Jaan"" with Rekha below the product title, but I received ""Umrao Jaan"" with Aishwarya Rai. Positively disappointing. Now I've an extra run to the post-office for the mistake of giving my business to Amazon.",1392249600,,474,4.7926829268292686
