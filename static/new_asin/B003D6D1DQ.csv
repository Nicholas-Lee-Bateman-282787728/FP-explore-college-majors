Should you be the kind of cheapskate I am, and unwilling to shell our four-and-a-half large to see a parade, the DVD is a substitute. Unfortunately, there are all kinds of grunts and monitors and photographers and people trying to look important in the way of your view of the thing itself. There's one fat little  photographer with white whiskers who gets into just about every shot. Looking around these clowns, however, you see the world's most fabulous street production. It's way cool.",1379894400,,661,4.64957264957265
