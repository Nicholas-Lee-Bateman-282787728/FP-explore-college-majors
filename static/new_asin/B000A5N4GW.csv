2367632,5,B000A5N4GW,"I've read several books on the AT. Also watch Trek and 2000 miles to main. This is the best of the videos. Although the others were still great.  You get a good look at the variety on the trail. The people, relationships, the wilderness, the isolation, etc.  The author does a great job at giving equal time to all sections of the trail.  Based on viewing this DVD I've changed some of my gear for my own 2006 thru hike starting this April.",1136246400,8,440,4.27710843373494
2367633,5,B000A5N4GW,"This is by far the most realistic and interactive material available if you really want to know about the AT and the few people that hike it end to end.  -reading material included.

This DVD reveals how the AT thru hike is not just a physical accomplishment. There is no end to the challenges emotionally, mentally and spiritually.. and yeah.. its a hell of a physical accomplishment..  FYI More people SUMMIT EVEREST then thru hike the AT!  Lion Kings DVD reveals a glimpes of the AT soul.  I value this highly and incourage purchasing it.

Thank you Lion King!! I relive my journey thru viewing yours.

See ya @ trail dayzzz..  ~Touk GA-ME '05",1135036800,7,646,4.605263157894737
2367634,5,B000A5N4GW,"If you enjoy hiking, reading about, and watching documentaries on the Appalachian Trail, you will love Walking With Freedom.  Of all of the trail documentaries that I have seen this one is my favorite.  Lion King takes a novel approach--he shows you the trail.  Other documentaries show you people in shelters talking about the trail and their experiences, this one shows you the trail itself.  Lots of footage of the trail in its varying settings and the wildlife encountered along the way (he must have filmed 20 snakes, not to mention deer and a bear) and the weather, fellow hikers, and major attractions make you feel as though you took a quick 90 minute hike of the entire trail.  The music is complimentary to the footage and makes the documentary even more enjoyable.",1133481600,4,775,4.796992481203008
2367635,5,B000A5N4GW,"I'm an AT thru-hiker, having completed the same journey ""Lion King"" did, although I hiked in 2005.

Before my hike, I purchased both ""2000 Miles to Maine"" and ""Trek"".  While I enjoyed both of those films, I have to say that Walking with Freedom gets a higher ranking than both of them in my opinion.  As much as I enjoy ""Trek"", it tells the story of a group of hikers who stuck together for almost the entire hike and also hiked in an unusually fast time, both of which are rare as far as AT hikes go.  2000 Miles to Maine, although its heart is in the right place, skips HUGE sections of the trail, and I thought, generally lacked continuity.

I first saw Walking with Freedom while I was on the trail, and I immediately took a liking to it because it was what I was hoping for from the other two films.  Lion King's hike was very similar to not only mine, but to a large majority of AT thru-hikes.  The movie has a ""flow"" to it, with some of the major ""attractions"" of the AT as bricks and a some great hiking footage set to an amazing soundtrack as the mortar.

One thing I particularly enjoyed about this film was the way it portrayed the ""ups and downs"" of thru-hiking.  Some people have complained about the ""partying"" scenes in the film.  But an AT documentary without a few scenes of the classic hiker parties would definitely be largely incomplete.  Regardless, these scenes are tame enough that most teens wouldn't even blink twice.

The best way I can describe the power of this film is to describe its showing at ""Trail Days"", the annual Appalachian Trail festival in Damascus, VA.  Before the film began, more hikers and hiking enthusiasts had packed the auditorium than I've ever seen before.  Hikers especially were not only in the prearranged chairs, but on the floor, knee to knee and shoulder to shoulder with each other providing an odor that was truly unforgettable.  As the film progressed through the states, hikers would excitedly whisper to each other at several key points, and downright explode into laughter or applause at several points.  Ultimately at the end of the film there was a standing ovation that lasted quite some time.

I had figured that my appreciation of this film would be lost on non-hikers, but much to my surprise my mother as well as her friends, most of which think nature and camping are ""icky"", also love this film.  It's definitely worth owning.",1131494400,11,2397,4.5607476635514015
2367636,5,B000A5N4GW,"I have watched this video multiple times, every time with someone new. You see, I have hiked the AT myself, and this video helps express to people what it was really like!

With an inspiring mostly original soundtrack and smooth editing, this is by far my favorite documentary about the Appalachian Trail. It's made by a real person with real pains, joys, and a drive for sharing trail experiences.

I hope Mr. Daniels hikes some more trails with his camera, so we can all follow along with a bowl of popcorn!",1127347200,5,509,4.582417582417582
2367637,4,B000A5N4GW,"I've watched this movie at least 4 times since purchasing it in May.  Videography is good.  Sountrack is excellent (hope that a soundtrack is released on CD soon).  Michael ""Lion King"" Daniel does a good job of letting the viewer know the struggles and emotions that a long distance hiker can and often does encounter.  Recommended to anyone considering such a hike.  Also a nice reflective film for those who have already hiked all or part of the AT.",1121040000,5,451,4.658227848101266
2367638,3,B000A5N4GW,"Mike Daniels treks up the Appalachian Trail with nothing more than an idea, a camera and a hiking pack from Georgia to Maine.

I saw it in Park City, UT when it premiered.  Its a happy film with this fantastic soundtrack. Most noteable are the contributions of Scott McCurry a wonderful newcomer with an incredibly wonderful new sound. I say buy it for the soundtrack and take it camping with you.  Miraculously, with no professional training or experience, Mike Daniel managed to attract some very professional help.  Dave Burrows, a texas filmmaker lends his professional expertise and put together the soundtrack and this film succeeds.  He did have some sponsors, but this guy basically walked the trail with only the help of some friends and the kindness of strangers to help him out.

The film may contain scenes of trail partying, but other than that, its a very nice film. Funny characters, difficult weather (snow, hurricanes) and close encounters with wildlife make this film interesting.  In this age of hard hitting journalism and difficult issues, Walking With Freedom goes down smooth and easy. When there's really nothing I can find to be proud of America for, this film reminds us that there are STILL perfectly wonderful things that our tax dollars are going to, namely our beautiful parks and natural resources.",1121040000,5,1329,4.986425339366516
8075010,4,B000A5N4GW,Kewl AT hiking video. It has similar characters that appear in some of the other AT videos. I think that Michael Thomas Daniel was on the trail when some of the other films were made. It is a good singular person view of the trail.  But it lacked a lot of historical information and seemed more technical.,1471996800,,305,4.350877192982456
8075011,5,B000A5N4GW,"Magic! Awesome! I would give it 10 stars if I could. I love the music, the scenery and of course I have a crush on Lion King. :)",1433462400,,128,3.607142857142857

8075013,5,B000A5N4GW,"As of February 2011 Campmor still has this marvelous little film. Great AT film. It could be call ""The 'Lion King' takes a Hike."" It has a homemade seat of the pants feel to it which to me is one of the highlights. It does not have the slick ""Voice of God"" narration that some others resort too. Not that that would be a bad thing, but this film makes you think that with a little perserverance and luck that you could do it too. And you could. I loved the soundtrack. While Amazon is out of stock you can get it at Campmor.
Happy trails.",1217894400,,538,4.084905660377358
8075014,5,B000A5N4GW,"As I enter my later years, I have grown more in love with the idea of actually hikinhg this trail. I have read everything I can on the subject and have watched several videos. This video happens to be the best one I've seen. I'm quite impressed with the many shots of the trail and how they actually give you a ""nice picture"" of what to expect. An added bonus, at least for me, is the attention Lion King has paid to the wildlife along his journey. I was absolutely elated to see images of deer, bear and snakes. I felt this attention paid homage to the other beings sharing his adventure. I also liked the integration of some very up tempo and appropriate background music. John Smith's, Appalachian Rain is a beautiful and haunting melody that brings great depth and feeling to the film. All in all, I really enjoyed this video. It was well thought out and produced. Enjoy it and GOOD HIKING!!!",1179964800,3,896,4.4363636363636365
8075015,5,B000A5N4GW,I really enjoyed this movie because it shows a lot of trail sceens -- really focuses on the experience of being in nature for a long time.  Great music too!,1179014400,,156,4.2
8075016,5,B000A5N4GW,"I had NO plans to make this trek and after watching this film I really am interested. IF you are planning to hike the trail, this is a MUST have. Michael Daniel does a great job keeping the viewer posted to each day's accomplishments.",1169856000,,234,4.340909090909091
8075017,4,B000A5N4GW,"I thru-hiked in '02 (Hopfrog) and have seen a few of the videos out there. I feel this one does the best job of capturing what its like out there on the AT. At one point Lion King seems to have an epiphany and speaks to the camera about how wonderful his experience is and how it fixes ya. Its worth viewing for that moment alone as he really captured the feeling a lot of us got hit with out there. I did feel the film taper off towards the end and it seemed to me that Lion King was getting more into ""hiking his hike"" than making a film. I can certainly understand that. If your looking for a video that will give you a feel for what it is like out there, I'd highly recommend this film.",1157932800,10,690,3.971223021582734
8075018,5,B000A5N4GW,"Wow - that's about all I can say about this DVD after just now watching it. I absolutely agree with the reviewer that pointed out that this DVD actually SHOWS the trail, as well as some awesome wildlife shots (those timber rattlers!) and fantastic scenery and viewpoint shots. Lion King was also not shy about filming some of the worst conditions the AT can dish out (those scary wind-and-cloud shots on Mt. Lafayette and that incredible thunderclap from the shelter in NY). He also was not shy about expressing his feelings about how his hike was going that particular day, which to me makes the whole video all the more real and compelling; more like the trail journals I have read. And the superbly well-placed captions actually told you where you were! I only wish the PCT video ""Walk"" had been done the same way; I thought that one, while pretty good, spent too much time on gatherings of hikers and their ""war stories"", and not on the trail itself. This video puts you on the trail with Lion King, sweaty matted hair and all, making the ""war stories"" come to life (though it does show a healthy dose of hiker subculture, such as Trail Days, the Half-Gallon Challenge, the giant pancakes, etc., which provides the perfect balance). All this to a great soundtrack that's not too rock but not too Windham Hillish. I myself am a small-time hiker; unfortunately, chronic neuropathy problems presently limit me to day hikes, and make such a mega-hike as this impossible; until I can find a reliable treatment(and I will), this video is about as close as I'll get for the time being; Lion King has performed an incalculable service for those of us who, for one reason or another, are physically unable to perform this great journey, as well as for those who are contemplating it, and want to get a real taste of it, and those who have done it, to inspire fond memories. Major, major kudos to Lion King and his crew; may there be more such ""Non-Hikeumentaries"" for the Pacific Crest, Continental Divide, North Country, Arizona, Colorado, and others. Hikers, get out your camcorders, get out on the trails, and give us some more of this!

P.S. I only with he had spent a little more time on Mahoosuc Notch and the Khatadin climb.",1140825600,8,2226,4.649746192893401
8075019,3,B000A5N4GW,The DVD was just OK.  The music was great.  It was just a home movie quality with a lot of handheld jumpy shots.  He tended to complain quite a bit in the show about the conditions.  The good parts were interviewing other hikers and the soundtrack.  I thought Appalachian Impressions was a better and more informative DVD.,1138579200,2,322,4.578947368421052
