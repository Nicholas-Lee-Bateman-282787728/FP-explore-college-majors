And because I am a guy who likes those animated kind of movies (For example: Alpha and Omega), it's another reason I like this one. And maybe other people just don't like those kinds of movies. I am fine with that because that's there opinion. But in mine, I love it!

But it's good enough for a good watch and the 3d adds to it. this does have the flat version , which is half the film of the 3d one.  it features good voice acting , from b list actors.  Obviously this is a low budget affair  and so you can't expect high quality animation, but it's not terrible and this is a low priced item, so no complaints from me. I would say that all animated films really can benefit from a 3d release.  And this one was filmed that way , so 3d collectors should want this one in their collection.  It's a fine kids film featuring talking animals.  So your kids should enjoy it too.",1450224000,,698,4.0510948905109485

He by his nature gets into trouble and gets exiled.  Sacha, also a coati, is his friend/sorta girlfriend and also princess of the tribe.  She goes looking for Manu and is captured by poachers.  The story goes on from there and has a moral of accepting others as they are.

Pro's:  Eh, It wasn't horrible.

Cons:  The cheap looking animation style.
  The really simplistic dialog of the script.",1440979200,,553,4.474747474747475
