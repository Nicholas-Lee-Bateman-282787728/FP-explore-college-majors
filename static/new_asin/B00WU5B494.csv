7153984,3,B00WU5B494,"These are all great shorts, especially Paperman and Feast! But please be aware these shorts are ALL released along with other Disney films on Blu-ray... These are NOT new or previously unreleased. If you are someone who buys a lot of Disney movies on DVD and Blu-ray, this collection doesn't really offer much for you. I will likely buy this collection but only because I don't own the DVD's or Blu-rays that the shorts are paired with. For example Feast is included with the Big Hero 6 Blu-ray, which I don't own.

Just a warning for people who might have seen this collection and thought they are new ones that you haven't seen before. I leaned that lesson with the Digital Shorts Collection 2, which had a bunch of shorts that were almost all on Blu-rays I already have.",1437955200,5,773,4.561151079136691
7153985,5,B00WU5B494,"I love and highly recommend all of these films, especially Frozen Fever which is a great follow-up to the popular movie. This isn't to overshadow the other Disney shorts however, which are all fantastic and many award winning as well. Feast I particularly love, in that it conveys so much heart and emotion without a single line of dialogue. Truly masterful animation and storytelling throughout. I'm so glad they're finally going to be out in their own DVD/BR collection.

One quick follow-up statement/request. I know that many of these shorts are available for free streaming on the internet, and not difficult to find. Despite this, if you enjoy Disney's timeless and beautiful artistic expression as I do, then I would encourage you to buy this edition and support the official release. With the proliferation of internet piracy it's becoming more and more difficult for artists to receive all the financial compensation they're due for their work. While it's true that Disney is a giant in the field of animated entertainment, and continues to prosper even in the digital age, short form work such as these projects are not the titanic money-makers that full-length movies and television are. If projects such as this aren't supported sufficiently, then there may come a day when Disney ceases the production of shorts films like the ones in this collection. Piracy will only rob us of future works of art, so please, if you like these short films then support the official release.",1435968000,68,1488,5.0

7153988,5,B00WU5B494,Finally you get all the short Disney movie opening cartoons organized in one place!! You can't beat the newest and greatest addition: the Frozen cartoon. Next the Tangled wedding is sure to make you laugh out loud as you watch Maximus face his biggest fear. The pooch story is always a tear jerker....but as always all is well that ends well! Here you will find Disney's best computer animation with the original cast all wrapped up in a bow! You will love this collection and so will your kids.,1433548800,11,495,4.573033707865169

7153992,5,B00WU5B494,This was a gift for my wife. She loves anything Disney and this is a video she has never seen. I didn't think that was possible. She'll get it on Mother's Day and I'm sure she'll watch it that day.,1493942400,,197,3.95
7153993,3,B00WU5B494,I would've rated higher if there were less documentaries in between each movie,1489363200,,78,5.076923076923077
7153994,5,B00WU5B494,"Got this at a great price on Amazon when they had it on sale for $2.99.  My only regret or complaint is that I missed the next day of sales when the Pixar Short Films Collection, Vol. 1 was on sale for the same price.  These are all cute and entertaining shorts but if you already own other Disney digital releases, DVDs, or Blu-rays you may already have some of them.  Even though I have 5 out of the 12 shorts from other Digital releases I like that they are in a single easy to find place as opposed to having to hunt them down on the various movies they came with.  It's convenient and for $2.99 was totally worth it to me.  I might not feel that way if I we're purchasing it at it's usual price.  If your considering it in a similar way then you may want to compare what you already have in case you have those shorts elsewhere.

Shorts that definitely come with other releases:
Tangled Ever After - Comes with Cinderella
Paperman - Come with Wreck-it-Ralph
Get a Horse - Comes with Frozen
Feast - Comes with Big Hero 6
Frozen Fever - Comes with Cinderella",1487980800,10,1061,4.2227722772277225

We've watched this on Netflix many times, but it's so nice to have the disc to skip commentary from the producers and jump around to the one's you want.

7154001,5,B00WU5B494,This is a move that I will recommend you buy the DVD. I have no option to skip the talks between the clips when I stream the movie online.

Our favorites are John Henry, Feast, Paperman, the Tick Tock clock one, Ballad of Nessie, Prep and Landing Elves, and the Tangled and Frozen shorts.

The way I found around this is to install the Disney anywhere app and connect to your Amazon account. This will let you not only jump to a specific short, but also download for offline viewing! Hope this helps!

7154093,5,B00WU5B494,"It's a wonderful compilation. Disney has put together an excellent collection of short films with heart and joy, and very likable every single one of them.
It is important to note however, some of these short films contain complex and dark themes such as dead, so it is advisable for parents to first take a look at these short movies (the first three).
It was also refreshing watching Goofy in its old and usual ""how to"" antics.
A must have, specially for fans of Disney movies of late, like Frozen.",1453593600,,500,4.566666666666666
7154094,3,B00WU5B494,"Confession: I'm heavily biased in favor of Pixar, which I personally think is decidedly the best there is when it comes to animation. However, the real why I only gave this 3 stars is because several of the movies didn't appeal to me, which is maybe a little unfair because there are some absolutely amazing shorts in here as well.

My absolute favorites are the one with the clock shop, the one with the cursed cat, and the animated version of a haunting story I remember from my childhood and that still brings me to tears (HC Andersen's The Little Match Girl). I think especially the clock one and the HCA stories could very well be turned into feature films from the concepts contained in these shorts.",1453420800,,706,4.559055118110236

7154097,5,B00WU5B494,"Okay, first off, I must admit I saw this collection first on Netflix, but I loved ALL OF THEM SO MUCH I wanted to buy it, to own it. Imagine my dismay, first of all, by apparently finding it only released on Blu-Ray (which is entirely out of our price range, player and discs) and only in Region 3 on DVD (wth, Disney?? don't you like pleasing American customers who aren't rich, or is that a question I should be asking?), but at least one reviewer here said a DVD was included, so thank goodness (and thanks for mentioning that!). Maybe I can give that part to our buddies who have a Blu-Ray as an anniversary present or something, because the selection's incredible all the way through, as I would expect from Pixar. :)

Secondly: ANIMATION HAS NEVER BEEN JUST FOR CHILDREN. Animation is just another way to tell a story.  But I do agree with those adults who suggest watching it first, to get an idea of what your individual kids might be able to handle. Yes, ""The Little Matchstick Girl"" is dark, but that's the original story, pretty much, and how it ended originally. NOT A DISNEY ENDING, but a Pixar one, because they stayed true to the story (btw, Hans Christian Anderson wrote that story for LITTLE KIDS, and it was published as such. Wrap minds around that one). As for ""John Henry,"" my goodness, that's based on a folk song that mentions him dying IN THE SONG--whoops, maybe  I should've included a spoiler alert. X-P

Storytelling in any form, be it song, animation, live-action, etc., is integral to who and what we are as humans, to help us deal with the tough issues, yes, even at an early age (again, your results may vary; take responsibility for your own situation and don't presume). If you allow your kids to watch the 6 o'clock news (or even overhear it), there's no reason on earth to worry about them with this. :-/",1453075200,,1839,4.497005988023952

Wise move, as most of these shorts are terrible and surprisingly dark (cat's mutilating their tales, a kid freezing to death, an animated clock stomped on, and John Henry dying of exhaustion... what disturbingly morbid trend was behind these?)  The animation is fine but there's no real substance to these, but rather they just feel like a jumbled collection of DVD extras you'd get from the ""disk 2"" of Disney features. Most are boring and implausible, such as the paper airplane one, or tedious and unnecessary like the Tangled one. The Goofy short was the worst and just reeked of unoriginal, disingenuous fakeness. Don't try to copy the originals... those old Goofy classics CANNOT be replicated with stale gags about Goofy buying electronic junk at a 'Best Buy'-knockoff.

Paige couldn't wait to get her hands on it. Only we couldn't, until now! Walt Disney Studios released a Short Films Collection that had so many of our favorites, some never released before, and yes, that includes me!

My all time favorite (so far) is Paperman so I was thrilled to find this on here! I expected it to be just stuff for my kiddos but I saw this one online when it was released and just adore it! Once I saw that I was eager to sit down and watch the entire thing with my kids.

We watched the whole thing straight through together the first time. Now that we've seen them all, each of my kids have their favorites and thanks to the menu set up they can pick and choose what they watch or just watch them all together.

If you have a Disney fan in your house (and who doesn't?) this would make a great stocking stuffer! The Short Films Collection has something for everyone in the family to love and cherish for years to come!

Not only the shorts but getting to hear the people who made each short talk about it gave my kids this sense of collaboration and creation, very educational compared to the dolts that just wanna watch cartoons. I will say that some of the subject matter is a bit strong but nothing a child shouldn't see, if anything it brings up questions that parents should've already talked about with their kids in some respect.

I loved Matchstick, the story of a homeless girl finding joy in her last moments as she dreams of a better life through the flame. It also brought my children's attention to a huge problem of homelessness and the lack of empathy people have. My children of 3 and 8 asked me what had happened and they now understand the joy that has to be found in the situations we find ourselves in and that caring about others is tantamount to caring for ourselves.

The next one we loved was Feast, such a great short. We watch a dogs relationship to food change with the relationship of his owner and ultimately why dogs are labeled mans best friend (although I remain a devout cat person). The last one that we enjoyed so much, was Paper Airplane. In this short a man who has had two serendipitous run ins with a charming woman, tries to get her attention by throwing paper airplanes out of his office window high up in Manhattan to a adjacent building across the street that this woman happens to be in a meeting in. The beauty of the short, aside from the actual artwork, is the music and story being told about fated love.

Of course the Tangled and Frozen shorts are what's on the case and I'm sure Disney knew that putting them on the front, people would buy first and ask questions later (shame on you for not doing the research), but every short including those 2 are great little stories to share with the family.

There are various art styles and stories. of course, the frozen one, the mickey mouse one and the elves and a couple others were fun.

7154178,5,B00WU5B494,"Loved every moment of this wonderful collection! Agree if you have little ones it may be best to start on How to Hook Up Your Home Thester and skip the first three shorts John Henry, Lorenzo and The Matchgirl. But these three are honestly nothing in comparison content wise to the Disney owned Marvel movies. Suggest watching those three separate from your kids and then deciding if they are ok for your kids. This collection is now on Netflix making it even easier to do a preview. My guess is most parents would not have a problem and talk with their kids about some of life's harder issues like death and psycho cats.

But make no mistake everything in this collection is brilliant, artistic, touching, funny, sad and moving. Best of the bunch for us is Paperman and Feast. It would seem likely these shorts will appeal to older more hardcore Disney fans than the younger Frozen-centric set.",1446336000,,894,4.658227848101266
7154179,3,B00WU5B494,"I love Pixar shorts, but this collection had several disturbing stories in it including a cat who's tail was ""possessed"" and he spent the entire short trying to rid himself of it by slamming it into doors and eventually hacking it off with a knife.

7154181,2,B00WU5B494,"I was expecting Short Films much like those in the Pixar Collections.  Those were amusing and original.  These shorts were for the most part early created films that had amateurish animation compared to that if the past 10 years. The only meaningful thing for most of these shorts was in looking back at early Disney efforts.  What was upsetting was the fact that on the cover of the case is a picture advertising a short from Frozen which would suggest comparable and more recent shorts were typical. I felt that I had been misled by false advertising.  The most entertaining shorts were from Tangled, Frozen and the Feast but the rest held little interest for me or my grandkids.",1446163200,,681,4.697478991596639

7154184,4,B00WU5B494,"To begin, I am fortunate that this is streaming on Netflix so I did not have to pay extra to view. If you are looking for Frozen and similar cartoons, you may be disappointed. There is one story with Queen Elsa and Princess Anna; it is last. Mickey and Goofy are in their own stories, but the rest are characters or story lines may not follow.
I have to compare this collection to Fantasia 2000. Many stories are set only to music or the spoken audio is difficult to comprehend.
Our family enjoyed watching, but we are great fans of Fantasia and classical music. High school daughter has always loved the John Henry story ""It's so sad, but I still love it."" My 4 year old loved the paper airplane story, the little clock and Goofy. The Little Matchgirl made me cry, but the story always does.
I recommend (as others have said) borrow the disc so you can navigate through or watch snippets online before you purchase.

I was teary-eyed after ""The Little Matchgirl"" for a full day, it kinda messed me up. I still want to cry just thinking about it.

7154194,3,B00WU5B494,"I love Pixar shorts, I do, but let's face it, most of us are here for Frozen Fever. Which, is why this collection feels a bit strange and eclectic. Some of the shorts are really not for the preschooler crowd, and others are just subpar. The shorts on this DVD really vary in their age appropriateness. So, let's break it down:

John Henry - This is a beautiful rendering of an American folktale. But, your 3 year old will have nightmares for weeks about John dying of exhaustion in his fight against the machine. Skip this chapter for the younger kids.

Lorenzo - Snobby cat is cursed with a possessed tail and goes insane and cuts it off. This one is just... weird. No little kid needs this, no parent should have to try to explain what just happened. Skip!

The Little Matchgirl - Another beautiful rendering of a classic tale... in which an impoverished, abused child freezes to death. No Disney ending here. Skip this chapter for the younger kids.

How to Hook Up Your Home Theater - No beautiful renderings or award winning animation, this is just slap stick goofy. Young kids won't get the humor, elementary kids might enjoy the slapstick. This one is just average.

Tick Tock Tale - Brave clock saves the clock store! This one is cute, and appropriate for most ages so long as you don't mind that the clock's ""cuckoo"" mechanism is a little wooden German man's pants falling down to reveal some boxers. My preschoolers though that was weird, but loved the clock anyway because he was such a brave little dude.

Prep & Landing: Operation Secret Santa - This is cute, even if you haven't seen Prep & Landing. The kids will enjoy elves sneaking around Santa's workshop on a secret mission for Mrs. Claus.

The Ballad Of Nessie - Like Goofy, this is a pretty average story about a little monster that is told to keep her chin up, but when she finally cries she creates a loch. The story is weak, I'm not entirely sure what the message was, and it didn't hold my kids focus. But, no violence or trauma. So, there's that.

Tangled Ever After - Rapunzel get's married. Haphazard, slapstick comedy ensues as her animal sidekicks lose the ring and chase it through the city. My three kids loved it. Lots of messes and things rolling through the streets. Plus, it revisits characters they love. A winner.

Paperman - Award-winning animation, truly beautiful. And, though there were no words, it still held the interest of my kids as they were rooting for the main character to get his paper airplane across the street. This is one of Pixar's best.

Get A Horse! - A surprisingly violent Mickey and Minnie short. The slapstick humor sometimes crosses that border between funny and too much. My kids didn't like it, neither did we. Don't waste your time, skip it.

Feast - This is the stuff we come to expect from Pixar. A fabulous story told with beautiful art and from a unique perspective. My kids fell in love with the dog and we enjoyed it too.

Frozen Fever - This is why you are really here, right? You probably would have paid this much just to get this short. Elsa and Anna are back, there are miniature snowmen. Your kids will watch it on repeat and you can finally get that laundry folded while they are distracted.

All in all, the shorts on this are hit and miss. But, buy it anyway because.... Elsa.",1445904000,5,3307,4.528523489932886

John Henry didn't totally bother me but the next one a cat gets posessed and ends up cutting his own tail off. (or so I assume, we had to fast forward when the knife came out!) Followed by a short where an orphan girl freezes to death outside. Disney should not be advertising that Frozen and Tangled age groups are the appropriate audience for such content.

Be assured that even the grimmest ""Disney-BAH HUMBUG"" lover of motion pictures will have to bow to the charm, pathos, artistry and sheer brilliance of this singularly adult fare.

DON'T BE PUT-OFF by the cover art sweetness. This collection has NOTHING to do with ""Frozen"". The marvelous anthology is a collection of theatrical shorts that have been accompanying Disney features for the last decade or so. These are NOT ""TV cartoons"". The stories, sentiment and production values were intended for the big screen. On a decent HDTV, you'll equally enthralled!

I challenge you to view ""The Little Match Girl"" without getting misty--if not full-tilt tearful. Dostoyevski meets Fantasia? Hmm.

Be aware that this is NOT all Pixar and CGI. You'll marvel at the Disney Studio's latter day cel animation (which comprises more than 50% of this offering). ""JOHN HENRY"" is a 21st century tale for a modern day audience. Drawing upon the animators' rough pencil sketches, the story moves along with elegance and style.

If you have not yet seen ""Paper man"", then grab the moment here and now.

So, where does this leave us? I could rave over each and every one of the theatrical short subjects featured here. Happily, my time (and my readers' patience) forbids. I'll advise you to BUY this collection, because a ""one-time viewing"" is simply not enough.

I admit we do not watch ALL the shorts but I love short films for my Toddler. It is not a full length movie so he watches it for a few mins and continues on to playing or I can turn off the TV.

Some parents have also found the first three shorts to be disturbing for young audiences: John Henry, Lorenzo, and The Little Match Girl. I highly recommend prescreening these shorts. Frozen Fever is also the last short on DVD so if its the main attraction for your tots I recommend selecting it from the scene selections.

7154303,4,B00WU5B494,"Even though there's a DVD version of this movie in the Blu-ray combo pack, it's not on a separate single DVD, just like the Diamond Editions of 101 Dalmatians and Aladdin (combo packs only). What's more, if you're expecting the Oscar-nominated Mickey short Runaway Brain (1995) to be here, it's only in an all-digital format via the enclosed Movie Rewards code, and not on the discs at all. Those are the reasons why I dinged this 1 star, but all the other content deserves all 5, had it not been for the aforementioned drawbacks. All the shorts in the DVD & Blu-ray disc contain John Henry (2000, uncut and in its original Widescreen format), Lorenzo (2004), The Little Matchgirl (2006), How To Hook Up Your Home Theater (2007), the Prep and Landing short Operation Secret Santa & Tick Tock Tale (2010), The Ballad of Nessie (2011), Tangled Ever After & Paperman (2012), Get A Horse! (2013), Feast (2014), and the newest one of the bunch; Frozen Fever (2015). All contain introductions by the folks who helped make them, and there's a bonus short documentary about these shorts. It's been said in it, that The Ballad of Nessie took at least 3 years to make, the longest production period for any 1 ""one-reeler"" Disney short ever (or at least in the modern era). If you have any of the ever-increasingly-rare Treasures tins, this would make a great companion for them, and this combo pack seems to pay tribute to the Treasures tins, while still being family-friendly, and not so scarce by being made in limited numbers! If your kids wanted this, or the live-action Cinderella movie (from 2015), just for Frozen Fever, try to make them watch all the other shorts in this release too, and see if they like these more recent gems before Frozen Fever. Why pay up to $30 or more plus tax just for that one short, for Pete's sake? Even without Runaway Brain on the discs, let alone a separate single DVD, go ahead and add this dozen of beloved modern classics as a combo pack, and/or in all-digital format, today!",1442448000,3,2007,4.656338028169014
7154304,3,B00WU5B494,"These shorts are mostly very good; not surprisingly, they put Frozen Fever on the front of the packaging but only show it at the very end. No big deal. What IS a big deal (at least to me personally, since I have a 3 year old): the second film here is a bit dark for any kids under 6. Its about a fat cat who shows off his tail to a black cat; the black cat puts a spell on his tail, he is suggestive of the devil. Good imagery, just not for little people. Artistically is was great, but the solution in the end is the fat cat has to cut off his pretty tail with this big butcher knife. My daughter floated on the surface of it, never really sunk in thank goodness - but I think some kids would be upset by it, perhaps have nightmares. Just use your judgement, based on what you know about your kid. The John Henry at the beginning was fantastic! Great history lesson there. So some good stuff mixed in, but I won't buy it.

7154317,5,B00WU5B494,"I must admit that I was hesitant to buy the two Pixar shorts compilations that have been released.  I had most of them from the various Blu-Ray releases of the films.  (Okay, so I didn't hesitate too long, but the thought did cross my mind.)  However, the instant I heard about the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Film Collection I knew I had to get it because I hadnt seen many of the shorts and knew I didn't own them.  Im glad I did because there are some wonderful shorts here.

This disc contains 12 shorts, with release dates ranging from 1999 up to 2015.  Yes, that means weve got some hand drawn animation mixed in with computer animation.  The shorts range from one about American legend John Henry to a new Goofy short How to Hook Up Your Home Theater and Mickey and Friends in Get a Horse! as well as the sequel shorts Tangled Ever After and Frozen Fever.

There are quite a variety of styles and subject matters covered in these 12 shorts, but all of them are good.  You can definitely tell that some of them are experiments in style.  That is especially true of John Henry, which features some artwork that has stitching on the edges and rough sketches on the characters faces.  It works for the short, although I don't know that I would want an entire animated feature that way.

A couple of the ones I hadnt seen before feel like they could be part of either of the Fantasia movies.  Lorenzo is set to a Tango and features a cat whose tail comes to life thanks to a curse.  In classic Disney shorts fashion, it has a few Dont do this at home moments, but it is lots of fun.  The Little Matchgirl is also all set to music, but it is a much more somber piece, in fact the most somber short on the disc.

The ones I had seen before, I really enjoyed watching again.  How to Set Up Your Home Theater harkens back to some of the classic Goofy how to shorts, and the results are hilariously funny, partially because they are so true.

Then theres Get a Horse! which is a brilliant piece of animation.  It starts out like an old black and white Mickey short, complete with Peg Leg Pete, Minnie, Horace, and Clarabelle.  However, suddenly the characters start popping through the screen and winding up as 3D computer animated characters.  Any fan of classic Mickey needs to watch it.  The gags are wonderful and the result is a new classic short.

Fans of Tangled and Frozen will enjoy the respective sequels.  In the first, Flynn and Rapunzels wedding day almost turns into a disaster when the rings start to roll away.  You won't believe what Pascal and Maximus go through to get them back.  There are so many great cameos from the film in this one.  Frozen Fever shows us that one kind of cold can still bother Elsa as she tries to create the perfect birthday for Anna.  Both shorts feature the return of all the original voices for a true treat.

Finally, there are the brilliant Paperman and Feast.  One features love at first sight and how paper plays a part in the couple getting together.  In the second, we see a mans relationships grow and change from the viewpoint of his dog and the meals the dog gets.  Both are funny and touching and both are well deserved Oscar winners.

All the shorts here average 7 minutes or so, but they manage to give us full stories, good characters, laughs, and tender moments in that time period.  Obviously, some focus more on one than the other, but just because these are short doesnt mean you aren't getting a full story.

In addition to the 12 shorts in the set, you also get optional introductions to each short by the producers, directors, and writers (or some combination thereof) who worked on each short.  Each intro is just under a minute and gives some fun backstory and/or things to watch for.  The only other extra is a short documentary hosted by T.J. Miller on the process of creating these shorts.  At only seven minutes long, it feels like one of these shorts and really could have been much longer.  Still, its worth watching if you are a Disney animations fan.

The shorts included in the Short Films Collection are fun, and Im glad I have them as part of my collection.  Ill enjoy pulling this out from time and time and watching them again, and any fan of Disney animation will feel the same way.",1442016000,,4270,4.423076923076923

7154324,5,B00WU5B494,"I love and highly recommend all of these films, especially Frozen Fever which is a great follow-up to the popular movie. This isn't to overshadow the other Disney shorts however, which are all fantastic and many award winning as well. Feast I particularly love, in that it conveys so much heart and emotion without a single line of dialogue. Truly masterful animation and storytelling throughout. I'm so glad they're finally going to be out in their own DVD/BR collection.

One quick follow-up statement/request. I know that many of these shorts are available for free streaming on the internet, and not difficult to find. Despite this, if you enjoy Disney's timeless and beautiful artistic expression as I do, then I would encourage you to buy this edition and support the official release. With the proliferation of internet piracy it's becoming more and more difficult for artists to receive all the financial compensation they're due for their work.

John Henry appears to be a ringer; it can be found on a previous collection (Disney's American Legends). In any regard, they were rather stingy with the number included here, a mere twelve. If you look at a list of their vast stock of animated shorts, some of which have failed to be included in any collection, you might wonder why only these twelve made the cut. Of the batch included, some are more than a little puzzling. Lorenzo is a weird story of a selfish and vain cat getting his comeuppance in a violent fashion. The artwork is rough and ragged but fairly interesting to watch. The Little Matchgirl has to be one of the saddest Christmas cartoons ever made. It is uncompromisingly bleak with an odd choice of subject matter for a cartoon: DEATH. At least How to Hook up Your Home Theater is fun and funny, featuring Goofy doing what he did best, inspired lunacy. Tick Tock Tale is both sw... Read more",1441756800,,1010,4.524590163934426

7154332,5,B00WU5B494,I can see where some of the reviewers are coming from regarding the content of some of the short films. However if you do your research before and/or watch the disk before your kids do you will be able to know what you want your kids to watch or don't watch. Maybe it's because of my literature background i knew what some of these stories would be about before even watching them and i knew what to expect. While i don't mind my kids watching the film i am preparing myself for any questions they have about what they watch. Nothing is over the top and i would say that each video is perfectly fine for children to watch. These films are defiantly a way to ease kids into talking about tough questions about life.,1441584000,2,714,4.296296296296297

7154334,2,B00WU5B494,Not great.  Most of the videos are artsy and too  complicated for kids.  The little matchstick girl dies at the end.  My daughter was hysterical!  Not good for small kids!,1441584000,,171,4.566666666666666
7154335,3,B00WU5B494,"There are a few morbid shorts in this film. My 7-year-old and her friend were terrified of ""the black cat"" in the second short. It creeps me out too, not gonna lie! Basically he possesses a fluffy cat's tail and tries various ways to get rid of him (drowning, train tracks ext...) and he ends up chopping off his tail with a knife. Yuck! Stinks because they were really excited about the Frozen short and now we have to skip the cat short every time instead of just being able to watch the movie.",1441497600,,496,4.287234042553192

7154339,4,B00WU5B494,"A mixed blessing of old and new animated shorts, some are Oscar winners, some were only nominated.  John Henry appears to be a ringer; it can be found on a previous collection (Disney's American Legends).  In any regard, they were rather stingy with the number included here, a mere twelve.  If you look at a list of their vast stock of animated shorts, some of which have failed to be included in any collection, you might wonder why only these twelve made the cut.  Of the batch included, some are more than a little puzzling.  Lorenzo is a weird story of a selfish and vain cat getting his comeuppance in a violent fashion.  The artwork is rough and ragged but fairly interesting to watch.  The Little Matchgirl has to be one of the saddest Christmas cartoons ever made.  It is uncompromisingly bleak with an odd choice of subject matter for a cartoon: DEATH.  At least How to Hook up Your Home Theater is fun and funny, featuring Goofy doing what he did best, inspired lunacy.  Tick Tock Tale is both sweet and sad.  One can't help but wonder how or why a Prep & Landing cartoon was included.  Then there's the sad tale of The Ballad of Nessie, a deranged lesson in what to do with life's little inconveniences.  Tangled Ever After is hilarious.  Paperman is the first Disney animated short to win an Oscar in 43 years!  It's a romance about littering.  Get a Horse is innovative but difficult to see because the imagery involved doesn't stand out on a smaller screen.  Feast, another Oscar winner, is about a dog and a romance over food, in good times and bad.  Lastly, there's Frozen Fever.  It's cute but uninspired.  Considering the price involved and how little you get for it, this is hardly a good bargain.",1441497600,2,1717,4.549019607843137

My twin 5 year olds asked to never watch that short ever again because it was so disturbing to them and  I agree. With the cover clearly marketing to the Frozen crowd which includes young children I think this short was inappropriate.

7154351,4,B00WU5B494,"A lot of the titles included here can be purchased individually, including Frozen Fever, if that's the only one you're interested in. I might have gone that route had I known this at the time, but I actually enjoyed most of the other films quite a bit.

Complaints about Little Matchgirl actually prompted me to go ahead and get the collection. I found it to be exquisitely devastating - even more of a tear-jerker than the beginning of ""Up"" (which also features 'silent' action without any sound effects or dialogue). Whether or not it's suitable for young kids is up to the parent - I for one was grateful to experience some genuine grit alongside the fluff.

Frozen Fever is a worthy appendage. It seems as though the writers made up for neglecting Elsa slightly in the coda of the feature. She's quite central here as she strives to make up for all those years she neglected her sister. It's mostly upbeat with plenty of slapstick, but there are nuances that make repeated viewings worthwhile. (Of course by then you'll find the song has stuck in your head...) Elsa's complexities are expanded on slightly as she is shown to be driven, perhaps a tad neurotic, but fundamentally a sweetheart. She wants everything to be perfect for Anna's birthday celebration, but of course a fun story demands otherwise.

I was pleasantly surprised to find there was an updated Goofy piece, done in the style of the classic 1940s ones but with a modern topic: How To Hook Up Your Home Theater. Great idea for a short film - I think many of us can relate.

Those were the standouts for me - a few others I didn't care quite so much for but most of the titles were well worth a pass or two, and I actually got a couple of evenings' worth of entertainment out of the overall package. That's as much as I can say for any regular feature. If you have a hankering for some quality animation with quite a bit of variety, this collection is worthy.",1441065600,3,1928,4.515759312320917

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection is totally awesome, terrific, breath-taking and very touching emotional shorts, as per example with The Little Matchgirl and Paperman. There are also mini-sequels to recent feature animation films, such as Tangled Ever After and Frozen Fever. But also television special tie-ins like Prep & Landing  Operation: Secret Santa  and theatrical animation shorts for home video laughs like How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, and a variety of musically-inclined animation shorts like John Henry; Lorenzo; Tick Tock Tale; The Ballad of Nessie and Get a Horse! But the one thing that unites them all is their total passion for the animated short art form, also for pushing animation to brave new places, for experimenting in ways feature films are often unable, and the passion of Walt Disney Animation Studios and the equally awesome PIXAR Animation, who continue to produce animated shorts in an era that questions their value, relevance and importance.

Even the most stringent critics must admit that the Walt Disney Animation Studios has come a long way since the late 1990s and most of the 2000s, with a string of critical and commercial successes restoring much of the studios lost lustre. However, along with a healthy feature film division, Disney has also revived its animated shorts program, accumulating enough of them for a decently sized home video collection. The home video premiere of Frozen Fever may be what lures a lot of casual buyers of the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection, but the other 11 shorts on the disc are not to be missed. Disney has always pushed the boundaries of animation technology since the founding of the studio in the 1930s, and the shorts on this disc continue in that fine tradition.

With all of the Animation Short Films Collection, you can either PLAY ALL in one go or alternative you can play them individually. But what is unique with these brilliant animation shorts is that you get a personal introduction from the people that were personally involved in producing these very unique and special animation shorts and they are as follows:

01. John Henry [2000] [1080p] [1.77:1] [10:18] Here we are introduced to Mark Henn [Director], who talks about the process on how they came to produce John Henry. This short is another animated retelling of the familiar American folk tale of the steel-driving John Henry and his famed competition with a steel driving machine. True to its folk origins, the early part of the short is a wonderful animated quilt chronicling John Henrys early years, followed by more traditional hand-drawn animation for the competition. The hand-drawn animation looks deliberately rough, with pencil guidelines and scratchy line work peeking through, similar to the earliest Xerographic animation used in 101 Dalmatians. To its credit, the short doesnt sugar coat elements like slavery or the way the story ends.

02. Lorenzo [2004] [1080p] [1.77:1] [4:50] Here we are introduced to Mike Gabriel [Director/Writer] who gives the low down on how he produced this animation short.  A wonderfully wicked hand-drawn short where the title character is a selfish cat that crosses the wrong black cat and earns a curse that brings his tail to life. What follows is an extended tango of Lorenzo and his own tail, and while the implications get surprisingly morbid, the brief pre-end-credits curtain call for Lorenzo, his tail, and the black cat ensure we know it was all in fun. The short is set so perfectly to a bought Tango CD and chose the first track which was entitled Bordoneo y 900 that its hard to believe the director Mike Gabriel didn't commission the tune for the short. On a technical level, the innovation on display here is in transforming early watercolour paintings of Lorenzo into his animated character on-screen. Mike Gabriel says he is totally thrilled that you are finally going to view it this purrfect animation short.

03. The Little Matchgirl [2006] [1080p] [1.77:1] 6:40] Here we are introduced to Dave Bossert [Artistic Coordinator / Visual EFX Supervisor] here Dave explains that this animation short was part of a project entitled The Music Project and also included is Tom Mc Dougal [Music Production Supervisor] who explains that the music is the star and that there was no dialogue or sound effects were needed. Hans Christian Andersens tragic fable brought to life by director Roger Allers with perfect hand-drawn animation and no dialogue. A desperately poor orphan girl sells matches in the street during the Russian winter with little success. Alone as night falls, she is driven to slowly burn her own product to try and keep warm, but each match she lights brings on a new vision of warmth and the comforts of home until the shorts inevitable end. Youd need a heart of solid stone not to be moved by this short. This animation short is a totally unique emotional experience.

04. How to Hook Up Your Home Theater [2007] [1080p] [1.77:1] [6:20] Here we are introduced to Kevin Deters [Director/Writer]; Ian Gooding [Art Director] and Stevie Werners-Skelton [Director/Writer] who were all involved in this animation short. We find out that Kevin Deters is a big fan of the Goofy cartoon shorts and some of the original background drawings were re-used in this animation short. While some Disney shorts are experiments in storytelling or animation techniques, others are a chance to visit old friends again; with this one reviving the classic Goofy How to shorts. Shorts like this and Get a Horse! nicely highlight the difference between Disney and Warner Brothers when it comes to their classic cartoon characters. How to Hook Up Your Home Theater updates the setting but retains the same charm and chaotic comedy of the classic versions. The short works specifically because director Kevin Deters and his crew don't attempt to reinvent Goofy in the way that Warner Bros. keeps trying to reinvent Bugs Bunny and friends.

05. Tick Tock Tale [2010] [1080p] [1.77:1] [6:02] Here we are introduced to Dean Wellins [Director/Writer] This CGI short directed by Dean Wellins feels a lot like some of the earlier PIXAR shorts, going without dialogue in a tale where inanimate objects come to life when people aren't looking. Set in a clock shop, the short centres on a tacky little clock that is the laughing stock of all the other clocks in the store, until a late-night turn of events changes everything. Tick Tock Tale is short on dialogue but long on beautiful charm. Dean Wellins feels that clocks have a distinct personality and that they used trainee animation artists and that they all did a very professional job.

06. Prep & Landing  Operation: Secret Santa [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:45] Here we are introduced to Kevin Deters [Director/Writer]; Dorothy McKin [Producer] and Stevie Wermers-Skilton [Director/Writer] and here we find out that some of the looks and personalities of the people mentioned were put into the elves. Another visit with old friends, this short is a spin-off from the successful Prep and Landing TV specials. Crackerjack Prep and Landing elves Lanny and Wayne are sent on a top-secret mission from Mrs. Claus herself, where they find risks and dangers in a most unexpected place. The existence of the Prep and Landing franchise is evidence of the peculiar sensibilities that draw people to be animators, because only animators could treat commando elves in night vision goggles assisting Santa as their own justification for making a film.

07. The Ballad of Nessie [2011] [1080p] [1.77:1] [5:32] Here we are introduced to Kevin Deters [Director/Writer]; Stevie Werners-Skelton [Director/Writer] and Dorothy McKim [Producer]. The introductory sequence from the filmmakers reveals that this short is drawn heavily from a student film by co-director/co-writer Stevie Wermers-Skelton, who finally managed to bring the dragons shed been doodling all her life to bring to the screen. This origin story of the Loch Ness Monster reveals her to be a gentle, sensitive soul driven from her original home by greedy land developers, while also underscoring the downside to the famed British stiff upper lip. The charming animation, wonderful music, and expressive storybook narration by Billy Connolly all unite for a bite-sized delight.

08. Tangled Ever After [2012] [1080p] [1.77:1] [6:30] Here we are introduced to Nathan Greno [Director/Writer]; Mark Kennedy [Head of Story] and Aimee Scribner [Producer]. More old friends, this time from the feature film Tangled. Ostensibly about the wedding between Rapunzel and Flynn Rider, the stars of this short are really the horse Maximus and the chameleon Pascal, who end up on a slapstick adventure when their role as ring-bearers is interrupted by an extremely inopportune sneeze. Maximus was easily one of the best characters in Tangled (if not one of the best supporting characters in the Disney animated canon), and Pascal was somewhat under-utilised in the original film, so its nice to see them both getting a bit of time in the spotlight. The short is a hilarious six-and-a-half minutes of highly concentrated insanity, mostly at the expense of Maximus and Pascals dignity. One fascinating fact that is revealed, is that when they were involved in producing Tangled Ever After, the actual wedding of William and Kate was happening in London, and they all tell us that they all had a lot of fun producing this animated short. Out of all the animation shorts in this Blu-ray disc, out of all of them, it is one of my all-time favourites, as it has so much going on and is very inventive, as well as a very funny cartoon and it is just a crying shame they could not of produce it in 3D, like the animation film Tangled.

09. Paperman [2012] [1080p] [1.77:1] [6:34] Here we are introduced to Patrick Osborne [Head of Animation] and Kristina Reed [Producer].  One of the most innovative shorts on this disc especially on a technical level, Paperman uses CGI to mimic hand-drawn animation beautifully. This Oscar-winning silent black-and-white short tells the tale of a man and a woman and their perpetual missed connections in a big city. In addition to being perfectly executed and entirely winning, the radical and inventive use of CGI in this short and the next one truly push the medium of animation in brave and wonderful new directions. I can only hope that an entire feature done in this style is on the way. To produce the Paperman, they had to use a lot of experimentation to get it looking just right and when you view it, you can see how much love and devotion went into this very emotional brilliant animation short.

10. Get a Horse! [2013] [1080p] [1.77:1] [6:00] Here we are introduced to Dorothy McKim [Producer]; Adam green [head of Animation] and old school Disney animation artist Eric Goldberg [Head of Animation]. Another innovative use of the medium, Get a Horse! mixes hand-drawn animation with cutting-edge CGI for a movie-in-a-movie thats a love letter to the earliest Mickey Mouse shorts of the 1930s. Like those earliest Mickey shorts, Get a Horse! is short on plot and long on animated monkey business, starting with a perfect mimicry of Uncle Walt and Ub Iwerks classic rubber hose shorts until Mickey gets thrown out of the film screen to turn into a 3-D CGI rendered version of himself. The playful chaos that ensues appropriately captures Mickey at his anarchic best from his early years. As with How to Hook Up Your Home Theater and Get a Horse! it shows that Walt Disney Studios understands how to update their classic characters to bring them up-to-date without losing what makes them appealing in the first place.

11. Feast [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [6:12] Here we are introduced to Patrick Osborne [Director] and Kristine Reed Producer]. This short feels like is a melding and updating of the living painting in Lorenzo and the CGI-as-hand-drawn techniques in Paperman to showcase how food reflects the different stages in our lives. The short centres on a very food-motivated Boston terrier named Winston and the way he and his owner pass through bachelorhood to marriage and what comes after. Disney Animation has always had a keen eye for canine characters like the title characters of Lady and the Tramp and Pongo and Perdita of 101 Dalmatians, and Winston can happily join their company from this lovely and heartfelt short. This personally was my least favourite of the bunch of animation shorts. We find out a fascinating fact that actual puppies were brought into the studio and had several Puppy Days and were a great deal of fun, which you see a clip of the puppies running about.

12. Frozen Fever [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [7:56] Here we are introduced to Peter Del Vecho Producer]; Chris Buck [Director]; Aimee Scribner [Producer] and Jennifer lee [Director] The runaway success of Frozen guaranteed that wed see the characters again, and thankfully this last short isn't just a phoned-in cash-in. Like Tangled Ever After and Frozen Fever is highly concentrated comedic mayhem that wouldnt have fit in the original movie without stopping the plot completely cold. However, its ideal for a short film, as Queen Elsa tries to fight her way through a growing cold to give her sister Anna a perfect birthday. The entire major cast is back for this short, with Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez also returning to provide a perfect new song to narrate the action. Disney could easily have shovelled out anything with Frozen emblazoned on it to capitalise on the properties incredible and on-going popularity, but Frozen Fever is a self-evident proof that the shameful era of direct-to-video is definitively over. But one bit of information that is quite interesting is that they created two new dresses for the sisters, that look spectacular, plus they wanted the animation short to look a really beautifully visual storytelling and they certainly succeeded, as it looks totally amazing, but what a shame they could not have produced it in 3D like Frozen.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The video quality for the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection is, across the board, is totally outstanding and without doubt not a flawed bunch among them. The rough style sketch-work of John Henry has been perfectly preserved. The fluid, freeform explosiveness visual dexterity of Lorenzo is brilliant. The soft subtle colour-drained beauty of The Little Matchgirl is stunning. How to Hook Up Your Home Theater is very impressive. The rich hues and absorbing shadows of Tick Tock Tale is very charming and draws in the viewer. The vibrant red-and-green festivity of Prep & Landin  Operation: Secret Santa is a total delights and the watercolour palette, plus the crisp and tartan patterns of The Ballad of Nessie is very nice and charming. Tangled Ever After is every bit as impressive as was the Blu-ray presentation of the animation film Tangled. And with Frozen Fever is totally impeccable, especially the colourful, vivid and wonderfully crisp images. Fans of these types of animation shorts could not ask for a more flawless presentation of the shorts, especially from the likes of the Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and PIXAR that has been assembled on this awesome Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Each animated short in the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection features an excellent 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mixes which accompany the shorts are all quite wonderful with music in all of them weaving expertly through the front and rear channels and split atmospheric effects peerless where appropriate, especially with lots of sound gags with How to Hook Up Your Home Theater and the wonderful dexterity in the sound mix with Tick Tock Tale and Get a Horse! Dialogue in those shorts which contain it, have been superbly recorded and has been placed in the centre channel. Nothing will disappoint you and the sounds will be a total joy to what you experience sound wise. Likewise, voices are clean, clear and precisely prioritised within the already engaging soundscapes you can experience.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special feature: @DisneyAnimation: The Short Story About Shorts. Hosted by T.J. Miller [Comedian] [2015] 1080p] [1.77:1] [7:16] At the start of this special, we have T.J. Miller, who announces he is a so called comedian, boy this guy is a jerk and a total embarrassment and I so glad he is in America and not here in the UK and he is the animation voice of ""Fred, in the Big Hero 6 [2014]. Here we are at the Walt Disney Animation Studios to look at the continuing legacy started in the earliest days of the Studio by Walt Disney, the Shorts Program is thriving today at the Animation Studios that bears his name, producing award-winning shorts that tell new stories and experiment with artistic and technical innovations. This latest chapter in the @DisneyAnimation series gives us an inside look at the process of developing and producing an animation short. We meet a few of the artists and filmmakers who make the shorts, and learn why they are such an important part of the fabric of Walt Disney Animation Studios. At the Round Table Panellists we have 5 talented animation artists and they include Mike Gabriel (Director of the animation short Lorenzo); Lauren MacMullan (Director of the animation short Get A Horse!); Kristina Reed (Producer of the animation shorts Feast and Paperman); Kevin Deters (Director/Writer of the animation shorts The Ballad of Nessie; Prep & Landing  Operation: Secret Santa and How to Hook Up Your Home Theater) and Stevie Wermers-Skelton (Director/Writer of the animation shorts The Ballad of Nessie; Prep & Landing  Operation: Secret Santa and How to Hook Up Your Home Theater). We get lots of animation clips shown, which include Big Hero 6 [2014]; The Old Mill [1937]; Flowers and Trees [1937]; Feast [2014]; Tangled Ever After [2012]; Frozen Fever [2015]; Lorenzo [2004] which for some unknown reason is shown squeezed of the aspect ratio of 1.77:1; Paperman [2012]; How to Hook Up Your Home Theater [2007]; Get A Horse! [2013]; Prep & Landing  Operation: Secret Santa [2009] and The Ballad of Nessie [2011]. But one fascinating part of this special feature, is the Group of 5 animation artists were allowed to visit the Walt Disney Animation Research Library and look at some of the rare animation original drawings and the animation cells, so delicate were the animation cells, they had a lady with a plastic instrument to lift each item, because they were so rare and delicate. So all in all this is a very nice special feature and well worth a look.

Finally, Walt Disneys Home Entertainment division is to be commended for not skimping out on stunning audio and the equally brilliant video quality, because in The Walt Disney Animation Studios Shorts Collection on Blu-ray. All the shorts are presented with the same high quality as the animated features get. Unfortunately, the only bonuses are short introductory comments to each of the shorts. It is understandable that animation shorts collection is not for everyone. However, this collection of the Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and PIXAR shorts provides the ultimate and easy way to see some of these lesser known animation films. One can marvel at the endless variety of animation techniques and technology, while becoming involved in a dozen different amazing stories. With a wonderful visual presentation, and some awesome stellar audio sound mixes, the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection comes top of my Blu-ray Animation Collection and especially from the Walt Disney Studios and PIXAR. Very Highly Recommended!

7154360,3,B00WU5B494,We were very excited about these short films....Half of them were OK and then the other half were MORBID! Especially 'Matchstick Girl',1440979200,,134,5.136363636363637
7154361,4,B00WU5B494,"I found a few of the shorts absolutely hilarious! Tangled Ever After and  Prep & Landing: Operation Secret Santa were my favorite. I want to give a short warning to parents of young children though. Lorenzo and The Little Match Girl are VERY VERY dark shorts. Lorenzo is about a cat who tail comes alive and in the end he ends up cutting off his own tail. I am 23 and my husband and I were watching it and kind of looked at each other in disbelief. I have a 17 year old step daughter but I cant imagine trying to explain that to a young child.  The Little Match Girl is about a young girl who is homeless and trying to sell matches on the street. After no one buys them she ends up going in a alley, starts to light her matches to warm her self and she hallucinates images of grandmother. After her last match is gone she dies...Yes she dies from the cold. I was  SHOCKED that Disney would include this on a DVD along side child friendly shorts like Frozen. As a parent I highly suggest skipping over these two as they can be easily upsetting to younger children. I understand death is a part of life but I don't think it belongs next to thing like Tangled and Frozen.

I really liked the Filmmakers intros! They gave you a tidbit of information about each short and was not long at all.

Other then the two dark shorts I mentioned this DVD is a great collection.

7154370,3,B00WU5B494,"It would have been nice if Disney put Tangled ever after and Frozen Fever at the beginning, but they did those more toward the end, so i can't do the play all feature on the DVD because my daughter will walk away from it. She is only interested in those two very short movies. I can not wait until they come out with Frozen 2. My two year old keeps wanting to watch Tangled ever after and Frozen Fever over and over and over. I liked Paperman, that's a cute one and made my boyfriend tear up (awww). I only wish that Disney put on ALL of the Disney shorts from the previous DVDs and maybe some of the Toy Story shorts they did in the past. The short story collection is too short for my daughter. I hope in the future she will appreciate it more than what she does now, but it's worth it because i finally got to see Tangled ever after and Frozen Fever myself and i thought they were really cute. Tangled ever after is so funny, i love the horse Maximum and they make him and Pascal the main characters in this short movie. If you love the Disney short movies, then this is worth the purchase, but if you are only interested in two short stories like my daughter, then you are going to feel disappointed",1440892800,,1203,4.167381974248927
7154371,5,B00WU5B494,"I bought this collection for Feast, which is my favorite short so far.  Yes from the packaging it looks like it is just Frozen shorts.  But when buying a movie for yourself, do you normally just buy it and not read the packaging? No.  Do the same with your kids movies.

John Henry is a legend.  While some may think it is inappropriate because he dies, I didn't realize until she was talking to the child.

Lorenzo is strange, but it turns out to be a play at the end.

The Little Matchgirl.  Yes, it's horrid.  She's a homeless girl that dies on the street.  Not your typical Disney.  But true to the original ending.  Disney happified the ending of many classic fairytales and I'm glad they didn't do this one.  If you don't want to talk to your child about death don't watch it.

But seriously, don't buy something for your child without reading then complain because you think it's inappropriate.  I personally like having just the shorts.",1440892800,,944,4.502958579881657

Between John Henry, Lorenzo and The Little Match Girl you have probably one of the most depressing Disney releases since The Hunchback of Notre Dame! Where are the entertaining and whimsical shorts you open your new releases with? If you want to watch a DVD that eventually gets entertaining after kicking you right in the sad button repeatedly, I guess, it does get better. If you want to watch a couple of shorts with people dying tragically then get this DVD. One of which is a child. Her happy ending is her soul gets to enjoy everything she tragically missed.

7154375,4,B00WU5B494,"So as usual I liked the Disney classic characters short films. They were funny and heartfelt. But the short films of the characters I was being introduced for the first time I was taken about. The little girl who was out in the cold for the holidays and ended up passing made me cry. I do not know why Disney would want something so dark apart of their name. I did enjoy the paper man I thought it was a cute live story. The elf short film was funny and I beloved the ending of why the elves went on their mission it was heart warming. The tango cat tail was not to bad a little to dark for my younger one but, I doubt they understand the true meaning behind the film. Overall this are a lot of deep meaning behind this short film and I do advise you to watch these with your kids to be on the safe side.",1440806400,,804,3.9691358024691357

7154384,5,B00WU5B494,"My daughter is really enjoying the new Disney Shorts. She has watched it multiple times. One of her favorite things is that the look of the Disney Castle is different for each film so that it ties in with the movie. My daughter is a little older and John Henry is one of her favorites as well as Frozen Fever. She was slightly disappointed that most of them are not new, but she does like having them all in one place. Before we would have to try to remember what other movie a Short was matched with if she wanted to watch them.
She does enjoy the animators talking about the creation of the films as well. I could see how for a small child that would not be interesting but for an older kid it is nice.
As far as the Matchstick Girl....I cried. My daughter did not. It did lead to an interesting discussion about poverty that I think was good for my daughter. Sometimes she forgets how incredibly blessed we are. I would say use your judgment as a parent. At 4 she would not have understood the subject, at 11 it was perfectly fine.",1440720000,,1034,4.2272727272727275

I'm not alone in being disappointed that the cover heavily features the Frozen Characters (as much as I liked the movie), so having ""Frozen Fever"" play last seems fitting; The older shorts deserve more love.

7154408,4,B00WU5B494,"I honestly was on the fence about buying the DVD because I wasn't a huge fan of Tangled or Frozen.  However, I got the chance to watch this at a special preview event at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, and ALL of the other shorts make up for it!  I was especially impressed that Disney stayed true to the original (albeit sad) endings for 'John Henry' and 'The Little Match Girl'.  To be honest, I thought they'd go the same route they did for 'Steadfast Tin Soldier' in Fantasia 2000, and alter things to make the stories have happy endings.  It was a pleasant surprise for me when that didn't happen here.  Now I've seen some people (parents in particular) complaining about the dark subject matter, and I will say, it was probably not the best idea on Disney's part to clump all three of them together like that at the beginning.  Interspersing them with the more light-hearted ones might have been better.  Still - I wanted to touch on some things that the negative reviews aren't mentioning.

~John Henry - Disney stays true to the original while still leaving things on a positive note.  Yes, John Henry died, but his death served a greater purpose - one he was more than willing to give his life for.  That is a classic, and age-old theme - someone dying so that the people they care about can have better lives.

~The Little Match Girl - Yes, she dies at the end, but it's not graphic in any way.  It's also done tastefully and in a beautiful fashion.  Her grandmother's spirit comes to take her away, and the moment is filled with such warmth and light that you can't doubt the girl's spirit is going to a place where she'll be happy and loved.

~Lorenzo (aka the cat with the 'killer' tail) - If you watch this one all the way through to the end, it's revealed to be a play that the two cats and the 'tail' have been putting on.  There isn't any real 'possession' or 'dismemberment' going on. The 'tail' is actually a separate creature entirely, and only pretending to be the other cat's tail.  Most children can understand the concept of 'pretending' (I would hope).

Also - can I just end with - how are the themes in these three shorts any different than when Carl loses his wife, Ellie?  Or when Elsa and Anna's parents drown at sea?  Or when Bambie's mother is shot and killed by a hunter?  Or how about when Ray is crushed to death by Dr. Facilier?  Ursula being stabbed through the chest by a boat?  Need I go on?

Now, on to the reason this only got 4 stars.  The music with lyrics was pretty corny.  There's no other word for it, really.  I would've preferred if the songs that were sung had been left out entirely.  Fortunately, most of the shorts were just music, or a combo of music and speaking, which I found much more enjoyable.",1440374400,10,2767,4.385068762278978

7154420,1,B00WU5B494,"I have loved Disney all my life now my kids watch it. This is not a good choice for kids in my opinion. The first shorts, someone works himself to death. Then there is a creepy cat trying to murder his own tail with a huge knife. Then you watch a little homeless girl freeze to death in the street during winter. Good grief! I was in tears and horrified. My daughter was freaked out and thank goodness my son didn't see it. It's too much for young kids, so I took no chances and fast forwarded to tangled and frozen. I will have to watch the rest by myself to screen it. If you decide to buy this watch it first and see if it's appropriate for your child's age. That's my advise, wish someone would have warned me.",1440374400,8,714,4.107142857142857
7154421,4,B00WU5B494,"Like most anthologies, there are quite a few shorts here that are good and there are some that are probably just passable. The amount of variety on these shorts is enough to satisfy many viewers of all ages though. Whether its the magic found in Paperman and beast or the inventiveness of Get a Horse, most shorts in this collection is pleasant to watch. One of the best of the lot I find is Lorenzo--truly one of the most beautiful, imaginative short films out of Disney in many years. The rest of the shorts are okay. Some are promotional, like the Tangled and Frozen shorts. Well done but not inspired. The features were better. Prep and Landing is an overextended student film--pretty bland. John Henry, Tick Tock Tale Matchgirl, and Feast are pleasant if forgettable. The only big clunker in the bunch is the ballad of nessie.
While the picture was almost flawless, the audio quality is impeccable from the first moment you open the shorts collection on Blu-ray to the moment where the beautiful music is playing along with the short. I'm glad to have this, but maybe my hopes were a bit high. Overall this disc is worth owning.",1440288000,,1133,4.641791044776119
7154422,4,B00WU5B494,"Dear Disney,

Thank you for making creative short films and releasing hard to find art that you own in a collectable and entertaining form. It was worth the Bluray combo pack to get the DvD (at the mildly used price to say the least).

THAT BEING SAID. Stick to Leonard Maltin for your behind the scenes stuff and do not use TJ Miller to sell us on what is essentially an art gallery tour.  And if you are going to sit down Eric Goldberg to talk about a cartoon he made, for the love of god let him talk. We want to LEARN SOMETHING about how these things are made when you SAY SOMETHING about how they are made. Even if you have to give the rose-tint-nostalgic-beer-goggles version of the process to keep the ""Disney Magic"" alive, I find the technique and inspiration a bit more interesting at some kind of length rather than sound bites.

But then again I may be spoiled for the tremendous bonus features you have on all the old classic films that make stuff like Bambi and Pinocchio seem like the 8th and 9th wonders of the world. Just try to have your next blu-ray mandatory release have longer interviews that a vine on the internet.

Sincerely,

-Matt",1440288000,2,1156,4.403755868544601

I suppose it might be argued not right for under 6 without at least having been previewed by a guardian because it does bring up the  fact in matchstick girl that children die.  If you have not explained this truth to your child  that could bring up  a tough conversation.  Otherwise it's a great  DVD I'd highly recommend.

7154425,4,B00WU5B494,"This collection features twelve short films produced by Disney from 2000's John Henry to 2015's Frozen Fever.

Included are animated shorts that tie-in to Disney's feature films such as Tangled After After and Frozen Fever and also standalone shorts such as the Academy Award-winners Paperman and Feast. What impresses me about this collection is the variety of animation styles and genres involved here. For example, there is the laugh-out-loud short How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, a Goofy short done in the style of cartoons from the 1940s and 1950s. By comparison there is the sad and rather dark, but beautifully animated, The Little Matchgirl.

On the plus side of this set is that it is a convenient way to own some great short films in one place. For me personally, I have not had the opportunity to see most of these before and I ended up liking most of them. I was disappointed with the lack of bonus features. There are intros for each film and a short, separate video hosted by T.J. Miller where he talks to a few Disney animators. But there are no commentaries, behind-the-scenes features, or anything else to speak of. Surely Disney could have put some concept art in.

One final note to parents complaining about some of the shorts not being kid-friendly. Please do your research before showing this to young children. Just because something is animation does not automatically indicate that it is appropriate for children. Although most of these shorts are kid-friendly, John Henry and The Little Matchgirl deal with death while Lorenzo is pretty dark overall. It might be a bit heady for young children.

Overall, I found this set to be an interesting collection of Disney short films. While not all of them are excellent, there is much to be enjoyed, including by adults.",1440288000,7,1791,4.8431372549019605

The only two we/our kids did not like included ""Lorenzo"" and ""The Little Match Girl"" due to how they ended (well, the entire ""Lorenzo"" was a bit disturbing).  With that being said, you may want to pre-screen the first 3 as the ""John Henry"" ends just like the true tall tale (I don't think my kids understood what happened in the end for Henry and they loved the music in that one).

7154445,5,B00WU5B494,"Disney Short Films Collection contains twelve animated shorts made between 2000 and 2015. These films were shown theatrically in connection with Disney animated features. Several have been included as extras on previous releases, but this is the first time they have been assembled in a single release. A standout is Paperman (2012), a wordless romance between two strangers in mid-20th century New York City. In black and white with a few  dramatic touches of red, it combines computer and hand-drawn animation, allowing artists to draw directly over computer-generated sequences.

For those who love vintage Disney animation, theres Get a Horse (2013), a Mickey Mouse cartoon with funny dialogue, a fast pace, and a great soundtrack. Mickey squares off with Pete, whos up to naughty hijinks. Minnie is on hand to lend support, and extras Clarabelle and Horace also appear.

Frozen Fever (2015) re-teams the cast of the hit feature Frozen. Anna, Elsa, Olaf, Sven and Kristoff are all present, with Idina Menzel once again providing the voice of Queen Elsa. Its Annas birthday and Elsa is determined to make it a perfect day in order to make up for all the birthdays shes missed in the past.

Feast (2014) is the tale of one mans love life as seen through the eyes of his best friend and dog Winston and revealed gradually through the meals they share. When Winstons master, James, falls in love with a waitress named Kirby, the dog finds his gourmet meals reduced to dog food and vegetables. The ups and downs of James relationship with Kirby impact significantly on Winston, who eventually puts the happiness of James before his taste for fine cuisine.

The Little Match Girl (2006) is based on Hans Christian Andersens tale about a poor young girl who longs for comfort and happiness in her life. Desperate to keep warm, she lights the matches she sells, and envisions a very different life for herself as the flames fill with images of loving relatives, abundant food, and a home of her own. This is a lovely, if sad, film that is fairly true to Andersen.

Other shorts in the collection include The Ballad of Nessie, Tangled Ever After, How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, Lorenzo, and more. Each cartoon runs between 6 and 7 minutes. An informative bonus extra is a featurette that takes an inside look at the process of developing and producing a short.",1440115200,,2358,4.838709677419355

7154449,1,B00WU5B494,"With a Pixar collection of shorts, you have a fun, entertaining collection of life-affirming animated stories.  Don't expect that from this Disney collection.  The first three shorts simply should not be included on a disc blatantly marketed towards children.  Notice the ""Frozen"" theme on the cover?  This looks like a friendly, kid-safe disc, right?  And it's made by Disney.  But it's definitely NOT kid-safe.

Shorts 1 (John Henry) and 3 (The Little Matchgirl) both end shortly after the death of the main character.  Of the two, John Henry was by far the less depressing story, but it still includes the death of the hero.

Short 2 (Lorenzo) is even darker.  It features possession and self-mutilation - definitely not topics for a disc marketed for children.

Your child may or may not be upset by the John Henry story.  Anyone of any age should be upset/saddened/disturbed by the other problematic titles - The Little Matchgirl and Lorenzo.  Frankly I couldn't believe these shorts were included on a children's disc.  I can hear the defense now ""But it's art!"".  No.  That's not a valid defense for including dark, sinister content on a disc where parents are expecting happy, child-safe content (given the cover, given the fact that it's a Disney title, and given the lack of any warning sticker - parents are expecting a child-safe disc).  At a minimum, this disc should include a warning sticker for parents.  Better yet, the content should have been more carefully selected.

If Disney wants to release an artistic collection of cutting edge animations with edgy subjects - fine - by all means do so.  But don't mix that in with the top-selling children-movie based shorts and don't disguise it as a kids disc!",1440028800,19,1722,4.913194444444445

It's the story of a little homeless girl who is unsuccessfully trying to sell matches to presumably feed herself.

7154461,5,B00WU5B494,"First and foremost, let me start right off the bat here and say this is an amazing collection of shorts. Much like the Disney Treasures DVD sets, this set is made to release some of the theatrical shorts Disney has made during the 2000's and 2010's. But not only that, in addition this set includes two shorts that would have been part of the unfinished 3rd Fantasia film. Each of the shorts are presented in their correct theatrical aspect ratios and the Blu-ray presentation makes them look beautiful to look at certain points. Special mention also must be made towards the introductions before each short; they're short and straight to the point, but for those of you who don't want to see them, you have the option of turning them off.

For those of you who don't own a Blu-ray player, a DVD is included with this set, so don't be discouraged by the packaging.

However, something that must be mentioned here is that most of these shorts have been released on DVD/Blu-ray before at one point or another; so for those of you who are thinking of buying this, just be aware that you could potentially be double-dipping.

Now let's get to the main point I really want to address here: parents buying these for their kiddies without doing the proper research. In particular, there are two shorts presented here that causing a few eyebrows to be raised and they are 'John Henry' and 'The Little Match Girl'. Quite a few are now complaining that their kids couldn't get past these shorts because of the subject of death and I'm beginning to worry that Disney might not do this sort of release again because of these complaints.

Parents, it is your responsibility to do the proper research beforehand. While I am not that surprised at the complaints lobbied toward 'The Little Match Girl', what I am surprised about are the complaints towards 'John Henry'. Parents, if your children do not know the legend which should've been ingrained in them during kindergarten or first grade, then may I suggest telling them American folklore sooner rather than later.

As for 'The Little Match Girl': parents, it's Hans Christian Andersen, a man who is legendary in the literature community for writing bittersweet endings for his various stories and poems. As such, this is one of the more faithful adaptations (though they do omit the reason the girl has to sell matches on such a cold day) Disney has put out.

So yes, while a good majority of these shorts are indeed kid friendly, take caution and tread lightly.",1439942400,127,2502,4.727064220183486
7154462,2,B00WU5B494,"I could not wait for my kids to enjoy this DVD only to have to explain after the first two shorts why both main characters died. Come on Disney, you had a little girl freeze to death outside. I've never been more upset with a Disney movie as I am with this one.

The Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection contains twelve short films that are bound to make you and your family laugh, cry, and stay on the edge of your seat.  Even though my family owns several Disney movies, we have only seen two of the short films beforehand.  The collection includes:

Frozen Fever - Elsa wants to make up for lost time and throw her sister a birthday party that she'll never forget.  The only problem is that Elsa isn't feeling that well.

Feast - A dog is enjoying the bachelor life style with his owner and all of the junk food that goes along with it.  Things change when the owner gets a health conscious girlfriend and hilarity ensues.

Get a Horse - The classic black and white Disney characters get a 3D CGI-makeover in this silly short.

Paperman - A couple falls in love at first sight and suddenly get separated - can paper airplanes reunite them?

Tangled Ever After - Pascal and Maximus lose the rings for Rapunzel and  Flynn Rider's wedding.  They go through a lot of effort and humiliation to retrieve them.

The Ballad Of Nessie - The origin of Loch Ness is explained in this story about a dragon who was kicked out of her happy pond when a mini golf course took over the region.

Prep & Landing - Operation: Secret Santa - Christmas is just around the corner and Mrs. Claus needs the help of some tech savvy elves to put together a gift for Santa.

Tick Tock Tale - Clocks can live an exciting life too, especially when the owner of a clock shop leaves for the day.
How To Hook Up Your Home Theater - Goofy just wants to watch a football game on a good sized television in the comfort of his own home.  Little does he know how complicated setting up a home theater can be!

The Little Match Girl - In the dead of winter a poor girl is trying to sustain herself by selling matches.  Unfortunately nobody seems to be interested in buying them or helping her stay warm.  Perhaps her matches can comfort her?

Lorenzo - A gluttonous cat enjoys eating in front of starving cats starting at him from his window.  As a tail-less cat walks by, Lorenzo makes fun of it.  He is then cursed with a tail that has a mind of its own that likes to dance the Tango.

John Henry - Recently freed slaves are promised land for helping construct rail road tracks. The deadline is quickly looming and they may lose this opportunity.  The legendary John Henry with his super strength gives it his all to  help secure better lives for his family and friends.

All of the shorts are entertaining and fun to watch for young and old alike.  Like many cartoons there is some silly violence and a couple of the shorts end with the death of the main character.  Fortunately, most of them are lighthearted.

7154483,1,B00WU5B494,"One star is for Disney marketing a short (Frozen Fever) at the same price as a feature. Instead of just putting out Frozen Fever for ten bucks or less, they package a bunch of other shorts which 90% of the public have absolutely NO interest in. Instead, I'm tasked with moving 1:22 into the video to show Frozen. Disney is fast becoming beyond the pale in both animation marketing and theme park costs. They're losing any goodwill they currently have, and come a downturn in the economy, their profits will tank accordingly",1439337600,6,523,4.695652173913044
7154484,4,B00WU5B494,"I recommend waiting for the actual disc as navigating the shorts using Amazon instant video is a bit cumbersome.

7154486,1,B00WU5B494,"Many of these shorts were made in 3D but as the 3D versions are nowhere to be found on this disc, I have to give it a one star rating.

I have a lovely 3D TV so I will never buy 2D films or TV shows that were made in 3D.

Not releasing a 3D version of a 3D film is like releasing a film in black & white when it was made in colour.",1439337600,6,331,3.4
7154487,1,B00WU5B494,"These are not really good short films. Some of them, like the Frozen one, introduce new doctrine into the Frozen mythos that can really be scary and confusing to younger viewers. I ended up having to show several other more mature movies to a few of my nieces and nephews.",1438992000,4,272,4.46
7154488,5,B00WU5B494,"The collection of Walt Disney studio shorts will be released on August 18th, I was provided a review screener by Disney in return for an objective review.

As has been noted in other reviews already posted (I think based on the contents list) All of these have been released as ""bonuses"" on other Disney releases but they are here together for the first time. I admit that I've probably only seen one of them before so - for me - having in one place was great. There's a lot of variety here and, while young children will enjoy the majority of them - films like Paperman and the Little Match Girl will really grab the adults. John Henry is what I call old-school Disney animation and it is ""dark"" at the end in the way they treat Henry's death.

Each of the 12 films runs 6-7 minutes but that's a bit misleading. The End Credits must take at least a minute as there are over a hundred (!) animators listed. Remember when we watched cartoons in the 1950s and 60s and the credits were up front and maybe 12 people credited. The world has sure changed.
You have an option to watch a single short or all of them and you can watch with the intro by the filmmaker for each. These intros last 40-45 seconds and, honestly, did add much for be. But they are there.

The BD has two bonuses: first is an interview with some of the animators by ""actor/comedian"" T.J. Miller (who I never heard of and found him a bit annoying). It's short (hey, this is a collection of shorts, right?) at about 6 minutes.
There is also ""Runaway Brain"" with Mickey Mouse but it is a DMA (Disney Movies Anywhere) feature. I'm not sure how that works but I couldn't watch it on my BD player.

The whole package runs about 80 minutes, but what's here is fun to watch. I can't say that the ""completest"" needs this but for those, like me, who have not seen these films before, it was a great opportunity to see what Disney Animation has been doing in the 21st century.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
