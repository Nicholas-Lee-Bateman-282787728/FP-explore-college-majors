7801361,1,1930004508,"this was not at all what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be about mansions and big houses, but it wasn't even remotely like that. It seemed very politically charged, and was a total waste of time",1432166400,,206,4.175
7801362,1,1930004508,"Yes, I did a mistake by buying this DVD. Yes, the author concentrated on people not houses and stated how rich they are. Most info on this DVD is free on internet but main point is the author never actually try to prove anything. Ok these people are rich and? We know they are rich without wasting
24.95$, give us something. My impression is the guy is not happy because he was not invited to take part in this fiesta. Too bad!
Plus the quality of DVD is really bad.",1369440000,3,466,4.188888888888889
7801363,1,1930004508,"Three points about this video (Where the Rich and Famous Dwell):

FIRST, This extremely low budget DVD has poor color and picture quality.  In most cases it is filmed in black and white because the camera pans in-out on photographs, while the narrator describes the symbols or buildings we're looking at.

SECOND, Some of the content presented to the viewer is speculative or, in the narrator's opinion questionable (example: ""...could this be..?"").

THIRD, The hum-drum distasteful and boring same old one-line music score that plays in the back-ground thru-out the video is so obnoxious and annoying it distracts the verbal message the producer is trying to convey.

FINALLY, Don't waste your money on this piece of junk; instead, by a good in-color book about the illuminati subject matter, or spend your twenty-five bucks on a better produced (authored) DVD.",1294704000,6,862,5.172661870503597
7801364,4,1930004508,"This video, 'Where The Rich And Famous Dwell"", presented by Texe Mars, is a well-meaning, and more-than-slightly frightening DVD, about where the richest members of the Illuminati live and lived, and the names of some of their less-rich, (but still extremely wealthy) ""proteges"", who,
while not being of Illuminati families themselves, still have achieved
great power, dye to their association with the Illuminati -- or so says Mr. Marrs.

Mr. Marrs shows the symbolism apparent on many buildings.  He mentions,
by name, people who are Illuminati, who were Illuminati, or who were and
are admired by Illuminati.  He pulls NO puches -- even, (Christian evangelist that he is), mentioning, in passing, a statue of Joseph of
Armethea, (as well as one of Thomas Jefferson), in a group of statue
heads of those said to be venerated by the Illuminati and their supporters.  He gives much chilling and convincing evidence of his theories, and if you are looking for tangible evidence of Illuminatism,
(or Illuminism), and the names of the Illuminati, their supporters, their history, and glimpses, mainly, of the OUTSIDES of their estates,
this video should more than satisfy.

However, I was looking for more.  I was ALSO looking for more INTERIOUR views of the estates owned by the Illuminati and their supporters.  Although there are, indeed, some of these, there were not enough of these beautiful INTERIOUR expanses to satisfy me.  I suppose I was looking for views of opulent interiour decoration, as well as purported evidence of the Illuminati.

The music on this video is mainly a drum-roll played on the piano.  Very down-beat, (as is intended), but also somewhat repetitious, boring, and
annoying.  This is ""background"" music which continually tries to force itself into the ""foreground"" -- thereby being far too obvious, and, I believe, destroying its purpose of maintaining an unconscious and growing mood of alarm and caution in the viewer.  Or, perhaps, such unconscious methods of producing moods are NOT what Mr. Marrs wants -- such subtrefuge being only the province of the sneaky, (such as the Illuminati) -- and Mr. Marrs wanted HIS ""background"" music to be ""right out there"", honestly, where all can be CONSCIOUSLY aware of its intent.

Mr. Marrs spares no one he consders to be guilty in this video.  It is a cautionary 60 minutes.  Armed with this information, one can more easily seek out further information, in order to draw one's own conclusions.

It's an effort which Mr. Marrs deeply believes in -- his sincerity cannot be doubted in the least.  But, I still wish there were more INTERIOUR views of where the rich and famous dwell!",1281398400,3,2653,5.02054794520548
7801365,3,1930004508,"Poor old Texe Marrs looks like he's gained
say, 78 lbs., since the last time we saw

7801368,5,1930004508,"Texe has expanded on his wonderful book, Mysterious Monuments, with this outstanding video documentary. I love the new documentary-style format with Texe's voice narrating the images that you see. He takes you inside the palatial estates of these tycoons. You will be amazed at the amount of satanic symbolism within the walls of these estates.

If you don't have Mysterious Monuments, I highly recommend that you order this book, and then add Architectural Colossus and Where the Rich and Famous Dwell to your library. Your knowledge base quotient will rise astronomically with these items in your possession.

I can't wait to see what Texe comes out with next.",1229558400,10,662,5.12037037037037
