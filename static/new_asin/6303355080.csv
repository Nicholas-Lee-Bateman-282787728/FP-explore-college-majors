631612,3,6303355080,"""Ski School 2"" is a departure from its predecessor.  Whereas the first ""Ski School"" was a party film, the sequel is a romantic comedy, albeit a romantic comedy geared more for the guys than the ladies.  I love the first film, so in comparison, ""Ski School 2"" comes up short.  However when judged on its own, the film still gives a nice, warm, comfortable feeling of entertainment.  It may not have you rolling on the floor like the first film, but it is more dater-friendly.

The DVD is minimal, really bare bones.  It consists of nothing but the standard FBI warnings and the feature title track itself.  There are no menus of any kind.  The film does have chapter breaks, but there is no chapter selection menu.  There is only one audio option, Dolby 2.1.  On the bright side, the picture is crisp.

Despite the minimal philosophy of this DVD, in the end I decided the film itself was all I really wanted.  I've been waiting on pins and needles for the original film to come out on DVD.  My reaction when I heard about this item when it was recently released was one of cautious optimism.  Perhaps one day the original film will be released.  In the meantime, I marginally recommend this purchase to anyone who likes ""Ski School 2"" or anyone who wants a fun, silly, low-brow romantic comedy.  However, due to the fact that this isn't the original ""Ski School"" and that the DVD is minimal, I can only give it three stars.",1109030400,16,1422,4.49609375
631613,5,6303355080,"There have been great sequels like Godfather II but none have ever reached the cinamatic heights of Ski School 2. Dean Cameron reminds me of the young Tom Hanks in the classic Volunteers another awesome movie from the 80s. The skiing montages and footage are sweet and I defy you to find a better movie to enjoy with your buddies over delicious beers.
They don't make silly comedies like these anymore and thats a damn crime. I love a great art film like anyone else but plot-lite silly films that you can watch just for a good laugh just aren't out there anymore. I honestly tell my friends that this is one of my all time favorite films and I am not kidding. Give it a watch - I can promise three things: 1) lewd and silly physical comedy, 2) goofball antics, and 3) gratuitous nudity in the classic 80s style.

631665,1,6303355080,"Just a heads up. I loved both of the Ski School movies back in the 90's. So when I saw them available on Amazon, I had to ordered both of them. Ski School 01 was great, just like I remembered seeing it in 1991. Then I put Ski School 02 in my DVD player and was surprised that it was a (TV edited version). The description on the website said it was the original R rated version. If I had known it was a G rated edited version and not the original R rated version, I would not have ordered it. So if you are planning on getting Ski School 02, just know that it is not the movie you saw back in 1995.",1450051200,2,598,3.8306451612903225

It is absolutely NOT Ski School 1, and although it was made only 3 years after the original, I swear Dean Cameron aged about 10 years. That said, it's a fun T&A romantic comedy with heart, witty humor and featuring a couple youthful fellas named Bil Dwyer & Will Sasso. I wish that car stealing scene with the two of them had lasted much longer! As for the star, Dean Cameron was enjoyable as always and carried the film as only he could.

If you've never seen the original or you can watch this movie on it's own merit and keep the original out of your mind, you'll likely enjoy it as it really is a good movie. But if you can't escape the memories of the original for an hour and half, you'll quite possibly leave a different review than I did.",1481500800,,880,4.201183431952662
