3691527,5,B001LT401O,"I've been waiting a long time for this series to come out on DVD. I would periodically check Amazon to see if someone had picked it up for DVD release. When I saw that Shout Factory had released it, I was excited and ordered these right away. I remember watching this show with my mother when it first started. Every Saturday Night we would watch the lineup starting with Golden Girls until that ended and continued with NBC's three hour block of programming. It was our Saturday Night routine and I was truly sad when this show ended. As I watched the DVD's, it's amazing how all of it came flooding back - some of the dialogue that I remembered, the storylines, etc. The quality is not as terrible as some of the previous reviews have made it out to be. Yes, it's grainy, but this show aired 1991-1996. We are lucky to even have the series released on DVD. I purchased Seasons 1-4 and have pre-ordered Season 5. Hopefully, I won't have to wait long for the final Season to be released.",1463616000,,987,4.398907103825136

3691533,3,B001LT401O,"A blackmailer awakens memories of a 20-year old crime, sending one of those involved on a killing spree. Meanwhile, Tracy [Rosa Nichols] is having nightmares of her time in an orphanage, and her boyfriend, Richard [Korey Duke], is obsessed with finding the root of these dreams. With the help of a psychiatrist friend [Tim Taylor] and hypnotist Charles Branson [Larry Jack Dotson], they push Tracy back through the doors of the orphanage to where the secret to her past and the present crimes lies. Will they be able to piece together Tracy's memory in time?

Four Sisters has some serious flaws. The blood work is not well done; the blood is uniformly red, no differentiation of arterial and venous streams, none of the viscosity that we know and love. The wounds appear shallow, at best. There are some serious continuity issues; in one scene, a woman is grasping at her unmarked neck only to start bleeding a cut shot later. Still, as obvious a red herring as Brenda is, the reveal is a surprise; the evidence seemed to point more to Tracy than anyone else.

As a giallo, this is not one of the best. There is none of the excellent effects or spectacular cinematography that you see with Bava, Argento, and Fulci. Sisters Four is more than just a slasher film, and more than just a mystery, but it leaves you wanting to watch Deep Red or Hatchet for the Honeymoon.",1290470400,,1367,4.644628099173554
