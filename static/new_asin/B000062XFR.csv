1686126,4,B000062XFR,"The 2001 Korean film won some Asian festival awards but is otherwise little known.  It's an interesting story about a young Chinese woman, played by Cecilia Chuung, who wants to make her home in Korea. Her parents have died and she has spent all her money to come to Korea in search of an aunt who has long since moved away. She lovely, she's young and she's penniless.

In the meantime there is a aging low-level gangster, played by Min-sik Cho, who has just come out of jail.  He lives in a rough tough world and he seems stuck there.  Life is hard for him, he lives in a dump and he is nothing but a pawn for the gang leader who tyrannically rules over him.  He'd love to return to the fishing village of his childhood but this does not seem possible as he has agreed to serve time in jail for his boss who has just committed a murder.

In order to stay in Korea the young woman had to marry a Korean and she and the gangster have had a paper marriage for about a year.  She's sick though.  We see her coughing blood when she goes for a job as a prostitute.  It seems a ruse at first, a way of not having to work at the oldest profession, but the audience soon learns that her disease is real.  She does get a job though, working as a laundress.  The work is hard and backbreaking but she gets into it, even does extra work, and the woman she works for comes to love and respect her.

She's never met the gangster she married, but she's obsessed by him.  She writes him letters thanking him for his kindness and even makes a trip to his town to get a glimpse of him.  He reads her letters over and over.  She's the only one that seems to care for him.

The acting is extraordinary, especially that of the gangster.  His face is full of expression and he makes the audience really understand his character.  It's a challenging role.  And he just shines.

The ending is sad, however.  And inevitable.

This film isn't perfect but It gave me a glimpse into a world that is otherwise closed to me.  I came away enriched by the experience.",1111795200,24,2037,4.20671834625323
1686127,5,B000062XFR,"It's two short sad stories of a man and of a woman. Yet, those two merge into a story of hope and love when the two characters are spiritually interconnected.
The man, a pathetic third class gangster in Korea, manages making his life leeching on his likes and the poor.  The woman, after the death of her parents comes to Korea to live with her aunt but finds out that she had emigrated to Canada.  No place to go back to in China and no means of contacting her ant, she has no choice but to stay in the strange land where people speak in a strange language.
It's hard to write a review without revealing the whole plot of a movie.  But I think that about sums it up without making this review a spoiler.
Choi, MinSik who plays the main character is considered one of the top actors by many in Korea, acts up to his fame, and Ceceilia Cheung who plays Failan,this is my first time seeing her in a film, is perfect for the role.  I highly recommend this film.
However, I felt the English subtitle was not done properly.  I am a native Korean speaker.  Whenever I watch a Korean film, I turn English subtitles on, just to see how the translation is done.  In this film, Korean dialogues are alot more gritty than the English translation, reflecting the characters as they are without the need to verbally explaining about them.  But, unless you speak Korean, what difference does it make anyway, right?
Did I mention I cried?  A little....Ok, ok, I cried a little more than a little.  After the ending something lingers on in your heart.  And that's the sign of a good movie whether it's happy or sad.  To me, the ending was a relief, happy ending.  Many of you might disagree with me though.",1082332800,23,1690,4.361022364217252
1686128,5,B000062XFR,"This movie is so sad withoug even trying.  The film makers were very meticulous in photographing the landscapes of the two lead actors' faces that emits such sadness and desperation.  Choi Minsik, looking less menacing than in ""Shiri"" plays a no good gangster who  can't seem to do anything right.  For some quick cash, he marries a Chinese immigrant lovingly played by Cecelia Cheung.  The Minsik character was teasingly urge by his buddy who arranged the deal to see what his new wife looks like, but in true form, he just takes the money and goes along his merry way.  I think this is the most pivotal part of the movie, becuase if he would have just taken a second look, he would have seen a face exactly like himself, desperate, kind hearted and just needing someone to care a little bit, it would have touched him and it could have changed the tragic course of his life.  Minsik and Cheung, [...]played their part so well, that you can almost put them in the ""Most tragic romantic couple"" list.  These two actors are  so crafted in acting out their parts, that this is one of the reasons why this movie is soo endearing.  I really loved this movie and my eyes are still a little sore from crying. A little disclaimer:  I got this movie from Amazon.cot, so the DVD has no extras, I am sure the Korean version have extras, but I am greatful that at least it wasn't dubbed.  For Sad Movie fans, this movie is a must.",1082160000,31,1419,4.415384615384616
1686129,5,B000062XFR,"Stay away from this movie. It's the heart-wrenching kind so unless you're okay with feeling blue after the movie, avoid this bittersweet tale of sorrow and regret.
Failan is about a down and out gangster whose miserable life just got more so when he learns of the death of his wife - a young woman by the name of Failan whom he has never met. As he goes through the process of identifying the body and other last rites, he slowly learns more and more about the person who was his wife only on paper. The journey of discovery is told with such grace that one can't help but feel for the both of them.
Initially, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was its tempo, but in retrospect, it was masterfully paced.  However, this realization took a lot of patience because the first 40 minutes of the movie was almost soley about the man. Now, I know it's important to engage the audience by following the subject for a while but I think 40 minutes is a bit too long. That said, I wonder if that might have been one of the keys to the movie's surprising ability to touch you during the final scenes. You feel a bit more compassionate towards him because you understood where he's coming from. That he, unlike his boss, was a good person at heart.
Once in a great while, a movie comes along and is able to significantly affect your perception of the human condition. This is one of them. Don't miss it.",1056240000,8,1402,4.330798479087452
1686130,5,B000062XFR,"Failan is not your typical love story and definitely not a ""chick flick"".
Choi Min Shik portrays a pathetic gangster who enters into a marriage with an immigrant woman, played by Cecilia Cheung, whom he never meets.  His life in shambles and seeing no way out of his miserable existence, he decides to take the fall for his crime boss.  Rather than finding himself confessing to the murder when he's summoned to the police, he's notified that his wife has died.
The scene at the end where Choi Min Shik breaks down and mourns the death of his wife is just heart-wrenching.  My friend wondered why he was so devestated when he didn't even know this person.  I told her it's because he had no idea he had someone who dearly loved him even though he was a pathetic loser.  He peddled pornographic tapes, threatened old store owners for money (he was even beaten off by one) and was about to give up 10 years of his life so he can buy a fishing boat.  It just broke his heart and mine to see that happiness and love was just around the corner, yet they were gone by the time he realized.
I was reminded of Marlon Brando's eulogy scene in Last Tango in Paris.
This is one movie that's hard to watch and forever grabs your heart.",1029456000,8,1223,4.342105263157895

1686132,5,B000062XFR,"I was very wrong...see my first review....I didn't really watch the film..so SORRY
KangJae( Choi Min Sik) is a lowest of the lowest. He hustles the back street by bullying little kids and playing arcade games. KangJae should not even be a Jopok(organized crime group, like triad) only reason that he's a Jopok is that his childhood friend is the leader of this gang. And even his 'friend' treats him like dirt.  One day, KangJae saves his friend from getting killed but accientally kills the other gang's member. Now KangJae is treated different, the leader wants KangJae to go to the prison instead of him because he has records of going into prison and without him, the gang will be destroyed.
KangJae struggles, to decide what's right for him, and when he is about to go to the police to turn himself in. He gets a message that his wife died. Then the movie takes you about a year back....
KangJae marries Failan to make some money. Failan came from China, hoping to find her aunts, but her aunts are gone to Canada. Now Failan wants to stay in Korea to make some money( cuz she has no family). In order for her to work, she needs to marry a korean guy( for legal reasons)aand KangJae was there to marry her. because of his friend GyungSu, KangJae gives Failan his red scarf. GyungSu tells KangJae to at least see her face, but KangJae leaves.
GyungSu takes Failan to some small city( i think it was Busan). and gets her a job at a laundry service........
man, listening and watching Cecilia Cheung speaking korean was something. She is cute. Choi Min Sik is one of the best actors up to date. The part when he's crying himself out cuz of Failan's death is some amazing scene.
This movie was a adaptation of a Japanese Movie called ' Love Letter'. WATCH IT!!!",1025827200,2,1762,4.50625
1686133,5,B000062XFR,"This movie touched me profoundly. The central theme is whether a man and a woman of totally different background can deeply fall in love without having met each other. The story is based on a screen adaptation of the Japanese novel Love Letter written by Jiro Asada.
Cecilia Cheung is wonderful as the title character, Failan, who comes to Korea to live with her aunt after her mother died in China. Unfortunately, her aunt emigrated to Canada and Failan is left all alone penniless in a stange land. At a local employment agency, she is involuntarily connected to a gang group, which concocts a fake marriage with a third-rate ganster Kang-Jae played by Choi Min-Shik of Shiri (she can't work with her tourist visa) so that they can sell her to a brothel. Fortunately, she ends up working at a cleaner and finds comfort in the red scarf given to her by Kang-Jae and the smiling face of Kang-Jae's picture whenever she is forlorn and melancholy.
His reason for giving her the red scarf? He didn't look good in it. He doesn't even bother to meet his bride at the employment agency. He just fills out the paperwork and forgets her completely after that day.
One year later, he decides to take a fall for his mob boss. To his surprise, he is soon visited by a police officer and when hs is about to confess to the murder he didn't commit, the police officer informs him that his wife passed away recently and that he has to claim her body.
Then the movie explains poignantly with quiet subtlety and mesmerizing imagery how Failan fell in love with him and how he gradually falls in love with his deceased wife that he has never met. We can feel the anguish that Failan and Kang-Jae experience through their superb acting and unforgettable seaside cinematography. There is some foul language, but it adds to the movie.
I have to say that this is the most heart-breaking and beautiful love story I've ever seen.",1024963200,11,1906,4.592375366568915

This film starts slow, then you get punched right in the face.

Hard to get behind male lead's character. He gets his in the end.

Female lead, Cecilia Chueng, is too aesthetically-strong and too gifted an actress for this movie. You really end up pulling for her character as she endures one hardship after indignity in a long string of misfortune. (she really does deserve better.)

A good evening flick that is intensely sad but will make you think for most of the night...

I STRONGLY disagree with the negative reviews (they have their heads rammed up their backsides) as life does not always end on a happy note with folks holding hands singing kum-by-ya. Get real, folks!

I do not have an MFA from some half-assed cinema school to defend either!

And then he falls in love with the idea of her after she's already died from a mysterious disease (I think coughing up blood is the #1 cause of death in Korean dramas).

Aside from the keystone cops aspect, decent story for a couple ten minute patches though frustratingly devoid of contact between the leads.  I gave up three different times. Count on a breathtaking woman to add dimension to a film.  Spent two hours on this turkey, not sure why.

1686224,5,B000062XFR,"I first watched ""Failan"" right after watching the Iranian film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baran/dp/B00DH8HI5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baran</a>, another film about the untried or untaken chances of the heart, and you have to believe I was about ready to cash in my chips; two thwarted love stories - two tearjerkers, really - probably not something I want to repeat again in one evening.  Yes, I suppose that's a ""spoiler"" but I think you need to know at least that before coming to this powerful, almost unbearable film.

Like ""Baran"" this has a story with a twist that happens early; but you may well not catch it, or not catch it right away - I didn't at first, whether through not paying close enough attention or somewhat poor subtitles, I don't know. So I'll try not to spoil it. Basically we have two parallel stories; as the film opens we see a very young Chinese woman, Failan (Cecilia Cheung) emigrating to South Korea - her parents have died and so she goes to her only relatives. Unfortunately, they have left and she is all alone; deciding to stay, she finds her options limited, and the only way she can stay for any length of time is through marriage to a South Korean citizen.

Enter Kang-jae (Choi Min-suk), a small-time gangster in the port city of Incheon, always in need of cash, just out of jail. He lives in a dive apartment with his best friend; he's always got problems with the boss of his gang; he gets no respect from the younger thugs. Early on, he seems to be struggling for a way out - eventually, through Failan, he comes to realize what that might be.

I can't say too much more without spoiling the whole plot - which, as I said, might be a little ambiguous, especially if you're not paying quite close attention. The film's narrative isn't completely linear, and it's the subtle way in which flashbacks/forwards are used that helps to give ""Failan"" it's ultimate power as melodrama and love story, as we wonder always what could have happened. Cheung is quite good as the put-upon Failan, though her character isn't all that well-developed and the film might be even more powerful if we knew her hopes and dreams and desires a bit better; then again, this ultimately becomes a moral journey for Kang-jae; it's really for the most part his story, and the very indistinctness of Failan is perhaps important to that journey. Choi is just astonishing here, every bit as good as he would be a couple of years later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oldboy/dp/B00ECW9WFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oldboy</a>.

1686226,5,B000062XFR,"Regardless of how you ended in this main page for Failan (especially if you were browsing on Choi MinShik's movies), I definitely recommend that you at least watch it one time in your life. Even if tearjerkers are not your cup of tea, it will be a very enriching experience. It will be very difficult not to be touched emotionally and asking yourself a lot questions about what you just watched. I will try not to repeat many insightful points made by the many excellent reviews here, and just say that I wholeheartedly agree with them. Thus, I can also confirm that the few negative reviews are just disingenuous to say the least.
The same director made the movie ""Our Happy Times"" (aka Maundy Thursday), another fine movie of the same caliber. Read reviews on imdb.com. I also recommend ""More Than Blue"" featuring Lee BoYoung, one of the best and beautiful actresses in Korea, along with Lee NaYoung (Our Happy Times). Personally I can watch these movies many times alone or with others and always get a fresh perspective and feel something deep in my soul as if you were watching it for the first time. Good movies like these will leave you with lingering questions well after their ending. I have downloaded these movies in my device through Samsung Media Hub at a very low price. You can preview these movies by searching the internet before you buy them. Other Korean movies that I like are: A Man From Nowhere, War Of The Arrows, and Once Upon A Time(2008 with Lee Bo Young).
I did not like A Sad Movie as much as others did. It is ok but definitely not at the same level as Failan and the other two I mentioned above. I agree that Choi MinShik is a great actor but never liked that much his other successful movies like Old Boy, Saw the Devil, and Shiri. And if you come across A Moment To Remember and The Classic, they were a total waste of time.
A test for a high-quality movie is whether you want to watch it more than one time, as many times as needed if you have to watch it with friends and loved ones. If you cannot bring yourself to watch it again or are indifferent then something is wrong. Only then is it worth paying the price of purchase. I cannot remember how many times I watched movies from the great Akira Kurosawa, Kon Ichikawa (The Burmese Harp), Masahiro Shinoda (Double Suicide), Yasuhiro Ozu (Autumn Afternoon), and of Masaki Kobayashi (Harakiri & Human Condition). I will be doing the same with movies from director Song HaeSung and the other Korean directors of the above mentioned movies.",1360108800,,2522,4.532894736842105

You could pull any number of scenes completely out of context from this film and just look at them and they might make you cry, but the characters they portray as a whole are not worth an investment in tears.

The story in a nutshell is this: Failan is Chinese. Her parents die and she travels to Korea to seek out her last remaining relative, an aunt, who unfortunately left Korea years ago for Canada. (I guess Failan's parents weren't very close to their siblings.) There must be a subtext for why Failan decides to stay in Korea because saying ""there's nothing to go back to"" hardly justifies accepting a paper marriage to stay in the country taking a job as a launderer to make money to pay off the mob who underwrites the marriage--after failing an audition to be a prostitute by coughing up blood at the interview. Kang-jae is the bottom-feeder gangster wannabe slob who marries her for a paycheck without wanting to see her or know anything about her. Time passes and gangster stuff happens. Kang-jae is about to take a ten-year jail time fall for his boss who promises to buy him a boat when he gets out but Failan dies all by her lonesome in some far off village and Kang-jae must detour his life in order to make funeral arrangements for the wife he forgot he had. This is where things get wonky.

Failan writes a couple ""love"" letters to Kang-jae thanking him for being kind enough to marry her and presumes that he is therefore a swell guy worthy of her love and devotion, but he doesn't get them until she's dead. Why would she write love letters to this guy she doesn't know? A guy who marries foreign girls for a fee? She must have some idea of what that kind of arrangement is all about. It has nothing to do with her. At the very least she should be grateful Kang-jae leaves her alone and doesn't expect sexual favors in return for his kindness. She tries to see him once at the video store where he works but the meeting is interrupted by the police hauling him away (for selling porn to a minor). It's not even close to an endearing moment. The film maker paints a portrait of this young woman as pure virginal innocence and devotion, which appeals as some male ideal, but nothing more. There is no reason to like this girl for who she is or what she does. We can only admire her, as men, for what she represents. And Cecilia Cheung, as Failan, does some powerful representing. She is angelic.

Min-sik Choi, most famous--to western audiences, at least--for his performance in Oldboy, plays Kang-jae. He is a superb actor with an incredibly impressive and expressive physical presence. He wears loose fitting pants. He's a man's man, confidence personified. But he's a teddy bear too, albeit one who's a very loose cannon perennially toying with the end of his fuse. He's got baby fat everywhere and wild baby hair. His face is a work of art, chiseled and scarred with been-there done-that experience, handsome in a Hell's Angels kind of way. He is an enigma who plays the paradox perfectly. He's able to make us believe he has entered some life altering introspective awareness stage upon reading Failan's letters to him when all he's really experiencing is massive regret for not gettin some the whole time. He doesn't even see a picture of her until she's, and I quote, a ""dead bitch"" lying on a table. And then he reads the faux flattering poems of loneliness from this Virgin Mary. I'd cry too if I were him. He blew it. He's an unlovable and unlikeable dunce not an everyman who deserves a better lot in life and tragically missed it.

This film is a crock of crud, highly recommended for the performances. It's not a tragic love story, it's a fetish. Keep in mind the first half of the film is sloppy gangster comedy developing the character of Kang-jae. Failan doesn't show up until the second half, and she's already dead. Her story leading up to her death is told in parallel with Kang-jae's awakening sadness (or sad awakening), dealing with her death. It's very effective until the unnecessary, testosterone injected finish.",1225065600,,4409,4.627075351213282
1686228,5,B000062XFR,"It was not popular movie at all when it was opened  in 2001. Yes, it was a big failure in Korea ,though many critics generally raved it. How did it happen? Because, many Korean movie goers were so inured to Hollywood style hyperbolic action movies , virluently romanticized gangster movies, and not-so-funny comedy movies that painfully realistic movies such as Failan were nothing other than 2 hours of painfully boring experience. But, slowly people began to pay attention to this movie due to excellent acting and heartbreaking romance that is subtle ,but highly emotive.
The plot of the movie is roughly based on a short story of a certain Japanese writer named Jiro Asada. But , the movie version is much more romanticized , so much so that two works hardly have any similarities , apart from the eventual tragic endings and the name of female protagonists. the movies begins with very brief scence of Failan(means While lily , symbolizes her premature death)'s arrival of Inchon( second biggest port of Korea) from mainland China in order to search for her relatives who allegedly resided in Korea. The plot revolves around and jump back and forth between Failan's life in Korea( yeah , it shows all shoddy, seamy,sordid sides of 12th biggest economy in the world) and third class thug Kang Jae . There are frequent flash backs that may disconcert some viewers and give a slight hard time to follow and assemble the whole plot, but when movies moves to climax (or anti-climax ) you surely can forget the plot but absorbed to the superb acting of two main protagonists. Unlike some idiotic reviews , the movie is more than worth watching. I heard that a Hollywood studio recently begin to shooting remake version of this movie. Certainly, another flop from Hollywood!",1215475200,,1772,4.867549668874172
1686229,5,B000062XFR,"This film is extremely beautiful. It is incredibly well composed and paced. It is superbly acted. Funny at times and utterly depressing at others. The characters are very well defined and rich. It's a complicated film in some aspects but the story is very easy to grasp. I definitely recommend trying to find a copy of this film to anyone who is interested in the world of Asian cinema.

Now for a small tirade. The people on here giving it negative reviews must not have really been paying attention to it. As to the comments about the characters being stereotyped, they're gangsters! Did you miss that point? Of course thery're cruel. They are in a gang. The other comments about us not knowing what Failan is sick with are pretty dumb to anyone with half a brain and paying attention.",1161302400,3,787,4.621428571428571
1686230,5,B000062XFR,"Well, I realize there was a lot of good reviews and bad reviews. I guess this is a type of movie that would depend on the type of person you are. If you really enjoy watching movies about the hardship and reality of life then this would be a great movie for you. It shows that life can never be the way you plan it to be and things can often go wrong. It is a very sad movie and I am surprise I had so much sorrow for these two actors.

But if you like action movies a lot more than this might not be the movie for you because it's more focus on real life situations that goes on around the world.

1686233,5,B000062XFR,"This movie is nothing like the ""feel good""-""happy ever after"" excuses for drama that Hollywood seems to insist upon.

It's a touching story, though Kang-jae is hardly a likeable person for the most part.  One would have to be heartless not to empathize with his unknown bride Failan.

Not much that I can add to what other reviewers have said except that I recommend this movie without reservation.  If there is anything to complain about-the sub-titles are rather small--but this is a minor complaint--and far better than the sub-titles intruding!

In life we all make choices-for Kang-jae it seems like he always made the wrong ones--until it was too late.  Cecilia Chung plays the part of Failan flawlessly,and Choi Min-shik also does a wonderful job as Kang-jae.

Quite a few really good films are coming out of Korea recently--this is one of the best. Buy it, rent it or borrow it--it's a movie well worth watching!

If only Hollywood could make movies like this!",1116201600,14,968,4.859756097560975
