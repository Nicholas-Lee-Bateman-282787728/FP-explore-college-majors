7562124,5,B019329V4Q,What can one say..anything of Michael Flatley's is worth watching. I bought this for my son who has just met M. Flatley in Boston. A life's dream fullfillled.,1457827200,,158,4.678571428571429
7562125,5,B019329V4Q,"one of his best, love this dvd",1497830400,,30,3.4285714285714284
7562126,5,B019329V4Q,"Great dancing, especially by lead male  dancer James!",1496188800,,53,5.625
7562127,5,B019329V4Q,I love it. I saw the performance live and the DVD was just as beautiful as the live performance! I recommend it.,1493596800,,112,4.136363636363637
7562128,5,B019329V4Q,I loved this video of Michael Flatley's final performance with the LOD ... he's a wonderful man and such an inspiration to all. I can truly say that a new LOD has been crowned with the wonderful performance by James Keegan. WOW is this such a powerful show and such a great way to end everything. Truly a wonderful item I will treasure for a long time to come.,1491264000,,360,4.231884057971015
7562129,5,B019329V4Q,"Even though Michael Flatley did not perform until the end sequence of the show, this show was still his same dance performance performed by a very talented protege, James Keagan, and just as handsome too!.  Michael was retiring because of the pain caused by the injuries from 20 years of dancing every night. I couldn't quite get used to some of the distracting visual effects and some of the music.  But all in all, the show was a smashing hit and you could tell that Michael was there behind the scenes, even though you didn't see him until the end.  Each time James Keagan would make an entrance in Michael's role, the audience would scream loudly in anticipation to see him dance, but would calm slightly realizing that it was not him.  But in the end, James Keagan gave a commanding performance just as well as Michael.  You could tell that Michael had groomed him.",1485475200,2,870,4.587096774193548
7562130,5,B019329V4Q,This was really great,1485388800,,21,4.5
7562131,2,B019329V4Q,Very.dissapointed with a production done by MICHAEL FLATLEY would like to return item.,1484179200,,86,5.6923076923076925
7562132,2,B019329V4Q,it wasn't a very good watch.,1484006400,,28,3.8333333333333335
7562133,3,B019329V4Q,"The dancing was great, but, Michael Flatly was only in the very last minutes of the performance.",1480204800,,96,4.705882352941177
7562134,1,B019329V4Q,"We did not like these pieces.  There was too much dark, and evil in the images.  It felt beneath the standards of this genre.  Did not like it - not good for kids.",1479859200,,163,3.878787878787879
7562135,3,B019329V4Q,"I prefer the original with the original performers, Michael Flatley throughout, the sets, the music. The performers were very talented but it was not the same, for me.  I did not care for the updated version with the exception of the special effect of the hallogram of Michael Flatley appearing as three and becoming one... that was amazing. All in all, though, I prefer the orginal Lord of the Dance version.",1477958400,3,409,4.76056338028169
7562136,5,B019329V4Q,Perfect performance,1471132800,,19,9.0

7562138,5,B019329V4Q,"Beautiful, breathtaking and stunning.",1469318400,,37,8.5
7562139,2,B019329V4Q,Not a single redhead in the show!! Discrimination! Basically a remake of the original show but with no new imagination. I have been obsessed with Riverdance and Lord of the Dance for the last 20 years and was excited to see something new but ended up being pretty disappointed.,1465862400,,277,4.673469387755102
7562140,5,B019329V4Q,Of course it met my approval!  It's Michael Flatley! Truly the world of Irish dancing will never be the same now that he's retired... To me he will always be the Lord of the Dance. I saw him perform 20 years ago in Lord of the Dance in New York... Amazing!,1465689600,,256,4.019607843137255
7562141,5,B019329V4Q,One of my favourite shows!,1465171200,,26,4.4
7562142,5,B019329V4Q,"Bought the blu-ray right after seeing Dangerous Games live with my 9YO daughter... it arrived 2 days after (merci Prime!) and since March, we have watched it as least every other weekend with our 3YO dancing in front of the t.v. This show is simply brilliant!",1463616000,,259,4.6521739130434785

7562145,5,B019329V4Q,If you are a Flatley fan you will not be disappointed. It was amazing,1462492800,,69,4.0
7562146,5,B019329V4Q,"Michael Flatley isn't ""The Lord of the Dance"" in this version, he does appear to do a couple of solo dances.",1462492800,,108,4.190476190476191
7562147,5,B019329V4Q,"Michael is his usual fabulous self.... and he will be missed.  However,  his group of dancers are fabulous and the new leading man is outstanding.  I enjoyed this dvd immensely as I have all of Flatley's.",1462060800,,204,4.611111111111111
7562148,5,B019329V4Q,AWSOME,1461974400,,6,6.0
7562149,5,B019329V4Q,Always wanted to see them live.,1461801600,,31,4.333333333333333
7562150,5,B019329V4Q,A DVD to watch over and over.,1461715200,,29,3.2857142857142856
7562151,1,B019329V4Q,"I guess they had to come up with something NEW but I couldn't make it beyond 23 minutes! I REALLY WANTED TO but OMG! The problem the Lord of the Dance videos have is PRODUCTION. The director seems to think because you have 15 different cameras views/angles....YOU SHOULD SEE EVERY VIEW, EVERY 45 seconds! I literally could not watch anymore because I was getting DIZZY. Constantly from tight shot, to wide center, to left tight, to BIRDS EYE!!!??? REALLY....BIRDS EYE VIEW from a concert dance production. The videos are....well no way to compare the video to the live production but this is just like comparing APPLES to African Poison Frogs!

Then there are the costumes. It's pretty apparent that the producers were going for SEX SELLS. The costumes are ridiculous and have NOTHING to do with traditional Irish Dance....actually, nothing to do with TRADITIONAL DANCE! Seems the costumes are more inline with Girls Gone Wild.

BIG FAIL Michael Flatley!",1461628800,,954,4.9937106918239
7562152,5,B019329V4Q,great as always.,1461628800,,16,4.666666666666667
7562153,3,B019329V4Q,"The show is just not up to the standards of Flatley's previous work as a choreographer.  That is what the three stars is for, not Flatley's own dancing which is but the last 15 minutes of the show.",1461110400,,197,4.184210526315789
7562154,1,B019329V4Q,"Not too happy since Micheal Flateley is hardly in this video.  He's only in the end for around 10 minutes.  The other dancer, probably his protege, is good though.  I wish I knew it wasn't him dancing, I wouldn't have bought it.",1461024000,,228,4.380952380952381
7562155,5,B019329V4Q,It never got dull.,1461024000,,18,3.75
7562156,1,B019329V4Q,"So I have never written a review for a product, but I was so disappointed with this Blu ray that I felt the need to write one. For starters, this should not be called Lord of the Dance. It is not the same show. The dancing is close to the same but ALL of the music has changed. That's right, when they do the big Lord of the Dance number at the beginning, it is not the same music that we all know and love. It would be like if you went to go see Phantom of the Opera, only to get there and realize they changed all the songs. How can you release this as Lord of the Dance when it is a totally different show? I wouldn't have minded if they changed the music and called it something else. However when I think that I am getting Lord of the Dance, and instead it is a completely different show, that is no good!",1460160000,3,810,3.915151515151515
7562157,5,B019329V4Q,"The BEST!!! If you can see in person, CHERISH!!!! Talented people!!! Riverdance is in Boston in May, it is an experience not to miss. Michael Flatley is am unbelievably talented man and this dream of his panned out to ""Brilliance"" his/their hard work and dedication is appreciated and immensely enjoyed.

7562158,3,B019329V4Q,"This DVD contains some amazing dancing, if only you could see it. The star appears to be the special effects guy who put together the amazing backgrounds. The dancers are great, but sometimes you can hardly see them because the stage is so dark, or their costume is the same color as the background, and their footwork only rarely is shown in close-up. All that being said, my 4-year-old loved the dancing robots, but I think the original and other early versions are superior in illustrating the hard-shoe dancing even if the production quality is much better in this version.",1459987200,5,577,4.78
7562159,5,B019329V4Q,"It was awesome. The movie kept me interested and was not boring. Lord flatly is amazing and so talented. I love river Dance and saw one of the touring groups when they were at John P. Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Va.",1459382400,,219,4.365853658536586

7562161,5,B019329V4Q,"1st Michael Flatley is only at the end of this performance.
2nd Dangerous Games is very similar to Michael Flatley's return to Lord Of The Dance DVD. It's basically the samething. With a few changes.
This still is very amazing and I would recommend it.",1458691200,,252,4.622222222222222
7562162,5,B019329V4Q,"Being of Irish descent I naturally love they type of dancing.

7562164,5,B019329V4Q,"Michael Flatley was superb!!! Although, I must admit that I noticed all the female dancers were extremely thin! I These dancers were great but quite a bit different from the dancers 20 years ago. Glad that Michael Flatley decided to add a little more dancing and gymnastics to her routine.i loved watching her dance.thank you frances comer",1458172800,,339,4.964912280701754
