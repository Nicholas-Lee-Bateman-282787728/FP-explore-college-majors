2901328,5,B000TI85VY,"Those who are familiar with the original Hellsing series can start to neglect the events from that story arc as this is where the new material enters the fray. It adds in characters not featured, or dominant, in the original series and begins to add depth to the story and develop the plot.

I want to note that this Limited Edition Set comes with not just the extra disc but with a statuette/plaque of Paladin Andersong similar to the one of Alucard that came with volume one. The details of this piece are top shelf going so far as to actually have readable religious passages painted on the pages of his bible and the gloves. Some assembly is required (sword hand insertion into arm and glasses) that the instructions are less than specific about in a certain regard but, an intelligent adult should be able to put it together.

The additional content on the bonus disc is nice featuring intervies, art gallery, Q&A panel of the director, producer, and voice talent from an anime convention, and some videos.

Well worth the price tag when you see all that it comes with.",1195430400,,1074,4.612565445026178
2901329,5,B000TI85VY,"The quality of this dvd is just like the previous 2 parts incredible. This limited edition box doesn't come with an artbook like the previous one, but just like part 1 with one of em 3D wall pictures. The figure is Father Anderson this time, and the details on the figure are really amazing, he even has his glasses ^_^. The movie itself is more violent than the previous 2 parts and is one of the best anime pieces I've ever seen. The images are crisp, the suspense and action/gore are mind blowing, the story is great... If there is one series you really must own, its this one! The box and packaging is one of the most gorgeous ones I've ever seen.

I don't do reviews, but this one is a must buy for everyone, manga/anime fan or not, just buy it! One of the best series ever made (so is Death Note btw)",1193011200,,806,4.2
2901330,5,B000TI85VY,"Answer: Very cool.  I don't normally write reviews but I want to register my support for the continuation of this series.  I read the mangas and it follows quiet closely.  Seeing all the familia scenes animated was great, I couldn't stop grinning.  Yes its violent but its a vampire story for crying out loud. This is a great adaptation with the style in keeping with the original material.  Love vampires?  Love anime? Love Hellsing.  I hope the producers are able somehow to continue with this series to the end.",1192579200,2,514,4.707865168539326
2901331,5,B000TI85VY,"For any one who doesn't know, the Hellsing Ultimate series is a beautiful and almost perfect adaptation of the original manga. Each volume is exactly one volume of the manga, of which there are eight so far, and, as anyone who has read the original will tell you, the original manga and the first Hellsing anime had almost nothing in common besides main characters (and not even all of those). Few (of those who don't hate vampires or coolness in general, of course) could read the manga and not be fanatically hooked. This series (the manga) has reached a level few ever attain. Buy it, watch it, love it; You will.",1192492800,8,616,4.558558558558558
2901332,5,B000TI85VY,"Though I thought part 2 was more violent, part 3 is just was full of blood and gore. I felt that some scenes were a little rushed. But oh well, it's still a great anime. I can't wait to hear this in english.

The story involves the introduction of Pip, then the South American motel massacre and finally showdown battle between Alucard and Tubalcaine Alhambra. One of Millennium's members. Buy the dvd. You won't regret it.",1190505600,2,423,4.565789473684211
2901333,3,B000TI85VY,"This is the first of this new series I can recommend. So why only 3 stars?

Well this Vol still suffers the same issues the previous two do. The pace of the show is to rapid, the characters are weakly represented, this one has even more of that needless and jarring switch in art style (the comedy bits), and what parts this one shares with the original anime, are done better in the original.

So why recommend it? because this is the first Vol that significantly diverges from the original anime story wise. This new one apparently follows the manga closer than the original anime did. Which means folks we are getting more of the Hellsing story. While I do wish this new one was done as well as the original, I can overlook some of that to see the continuation of the Hellsing story, something the original anime definately left me wanting more of.

2901334,5,B000TI85VY,"Awesome, I can't say enough great things about the series. Action packed, exciting, and worth every penny.",1217980800,,106,5.294117647058823
2901335,5,B000TI85VY,"This chapter of the Hellsing OVA is just like the previous chapters - lots of action, gory violence, and the occasional bit of humor to keep it lively.  But in this chapter, we get to meet the Wild Geese, the group of mercenaries Hellsing hires to fill-in their ranks, depleted by the Valentine Brothers' attack, not to mention meeting the Wild Geese's leader Pip Bernadotte.

There is also the introduction of Father Enrico Maxwell, the snake-like leader of Section XIII Iscariot organization (and the one holding Paladin Alexander Anderson's leash), who give Sir Integra information on Millennium, the Nazi organization responsible for the recent outbreak of manufactured vampires in England.  With this information, she sends Alucard, Seras Victoria and Pip to Rio, to find out more about Millennium.

But soon Alucard and Seras are framed by Millennium as terrorists, which propmts an immediete resonse by the Rio police and S.W.A.T. team (all supervised by Millennium member Tubalcain Alhambra).  What results is that Alucard goes on a bloody rampage, killing the S.W.A.T. members trying to destroy him and the Draculina - and ultimatly resulting in a confrontation with Alhambra, as well as a revealation into Millennium's plans.

Being this is the final Hellsing chapter under the Geneon brand (the rest, as well as the re-release of the first three, being handled by FUNimation), this doesn't disappoint if one is looking for a bloody, action-packed chapter.  A MUST-BUY in my opinion!",1215648000,,1493,5.2217573221757325

2901337,5,B000TI85VY,"As a true Hellsing fan, I can say that this is a great buy. I was so happy with volume 3, and I will be watching excitedly for volume 4. Only problem is mature content, don't let younger viewers see without at least feeling comfortable with its content. As any real Hellsing, or just a vampire fanatic would, I apperciate this as a great show of blood, gore and twisted humor.",1202860800,,376,4.309859154929577
2901338,5,B000TI85VY,"This DVD set was awesome, not that I was that surprised, as the first and second volumes were awesome as well. I liked the Anderson model, though he may lose his glasses easily and it is difficult to get the stand to stay vertical, but these are minor gripes.

What surprised me was how fast it came. The product arrived weeks before it was specified to, and I live in Canada. I am wholeheartedly contented.",1199577600,,407,4.426666666666667
2901339,5,B000TI85VY,"This DVD (and series) is brillaint.

The dub is really well done as is the original Japanese version. And the animation is superb, but maybe not for the faint hearted because of the blood etc but I'm not complaining. Also with the introduction of Pip, Major, Doc, the Captain and the Harkkonnen spirit, it makes the episode a whole lot cooler.

The extra's on the DVD's are really cool too. On the main disc you get the Japanese version, the dubbed version and a commentary with Victoria Harwood, J.B Blanc and Taliesin Jaffe (the ADR director). There are also trailers for other series from Geneon.
On the extra's disc, there is:
An interview with Ms Harwood, Mr Blanc and Mr Jaffe
The creditless ending for the OVA
A production art gallery by Ryoji Nakamori
A Voice actors Panel featuring Taliesin Jaffe, Crispin Freeman, Ralph Lister, Patrick Seitz, Josh Phillips and Jonathan Klein (and a surprise guest)
And the Geneon booth featuting the Hellsing Mansion

The DVD also comes with a bust model of Alexander Anderson (turning into his ""Anderplant"" form), which is extremely detailed. it includes one of his blessed bayonets and two pairs of glasses (two just incase the first pair get damaged or broken as they are rather delecate). A wonderful model to add to your Hellsing collection.

Overall, this DVD is a must b",1196899200,3,1321,4.8061674008810575
2901340,5,B000TI85VY,"I was skeptical about buying the Hellsing Ultimate DVDs after already owning the Hellsing Boxset.  Don't miss out on this series at all, the story follows the Manga more closely and the animation is amazing.  This is how the series should have been in the first place and this third volume is my favorite so far.  If you are a Hellsing fan or want an action anime that combines a good storyline, memorable characters and over the top violence then this is for you!",1196035200,,464,4.5
2901341,4,B000TI85VY,"It's unfortunate that Geneon (formerly Pioneer) is going out of biz in the US. Ironically, we'll probably never get to see the rest outside of fan subs...  (Which means yet more of my hard earned money will probably be going to Hong Kong and other sources of pirated anime just to get the series I like...)",1195948800,,306,4.464285714285714
2901342,5,B000TI85VY,I think that this is so close to the manga I mean I could pick up my manga and follow along I have no complaints about the dub or the animation except one pips dub i don't really like pips english actor but other than that I would highly recommend you buy this DVD or you could even get the Special Edition with a cool cover and more!,1195776000,,334,3.926470588235294
2901343,5,B000TI85VY,"I'll be honest.  I normally don't go in for Limited Editions but a friend of mine is in the AX 2007 footage.  I'm not a huge DVD extras junkie myself, but I did check out all of the extras and I was entertained by them all.  If you're a huge fan of Hellsing and the English voice actors (and they're all quite good) then I would say you will be well pleased by the extras provided by the Limited Edition.

This third installment of the OVA is amazing.  Pip is sufficiently smarmy and there are impalings, not really sure more needs to be said for fans of the series.  If you're buying this for somebody you know is a fan of the series, this is a good choice if they already have the other two.  This animated version follows the manga/comic *very* closely, so even a purist would enjoy it I think.  If they only know the previous animated TV series then the story has already diverged and this is new territory for them. (Which is probably a good thing.)  If you're buying this for yourself, and you're not already a fan of the series, you should probably make sure this series is your thing before buying all the way up to the third DVD.",1195603200,2,1138,4.255813953488372

8209500,5,B000TI85VY,"Fantastic news for all Hellsing fans! Thankfully, Funimation have picked up the liscences that were dropped by Geneon. Although I'm curious as to how Funimation will deal with the continuation of the OVAs, they are trying to use the same voice actors and similar packaging to enable current customers to complete their 'set'. Hopefully Funimation will keep up the great work Geneon gave to the Hellsing OVAs.

As for this DVD, if you like the previous OVAs, you've got no choice but to love this one too, more blood, more action and this is where the real story of Hellsing begins. This OVA covers from mangas (end of) 2 - (beginning of) 4. Everyone who reads the mangas will now know how great the story becomes from this point on :D

Thanks Funimation!!
