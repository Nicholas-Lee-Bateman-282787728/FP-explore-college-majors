2869099,4,B000RL6G8M,"I can't say I loved this - which is what I reserve 5 stars for. But who could love such horrendous footage? That said, the spell-binding footage had me glued to the screen, unable to move. I've done my share of reading about Hiroshima and Nagasaki and seen some documentaries - but this beats them all.

Actual footage of bodies shortly after the bomb dropped, reduced to body shaped ash. Survivor art drawn by children. Interviews with adult survivors. Footage of American doctors studying the after-effects - WITHOUT TREATING THEM. Horrendous. Horrendous.

And yet, the survivors exist. The film actually opens with interviewers asking young people on the street of Japan if they could answer the question, ""Do you know what happened on August 6, 1945?"" Incredulously, none of the young people asked in that clip had any idea. I'm sure they had heard of the bomb. They just didn't remember the date. But imagine!

Obviously, there are young people who do know, because there is another clip of young Japanese nationals staging a die-in in remembrance. Good for them. We should all remember, before we get too full of ourselves as Americans. We have made more than our share of mistakes.

Let's not make any more.

2869100,5,B000RL6G8M,"If you are not transfixed and terrified by this documentary, you don't have a pulse.  There are no heros, nor villians.  There are simply victims.  From those that died, to those that survived, their lives were taken from them on those two days.  The survivors are mere shadows, estranged from the world, traumatized and alone.

The importance of this movie can never be overestimated.",1186704000,8,385,4.953125
2869101,5,B000RL6G8M,"If anyone ever says to you, ""ah, just drop a nuke on them."" Or, if any policy maker ever says, ""What we need are tactical nuclear weapons"", then they haven't seen nor understand the real horrors not of being killed, but surviving an atomic blast. Instantaneous disintegration is the easy part of this discussion. This is a movie from the survivors point of view that should be shown to all Americans, especially anyone who thinks nuclear war is a game to be won. The effects of these bombs in August, 1945 are still with the survivors today. I never stopped to think what life must be like with your skin burned off, or the side of your face sheered away, or skin dangling like string from your body. You may not be able to watch this documentary all the way through as you see U. S. Army footage of the actual horrors of these blasts, but when you return to the TV after having cried, you will leave with a deep understanding that nuclear weapons are one of the scientific advances the human race should never use again.",1186444800,117,1021,4.4361702127659575

2869127,5,B000RL6G8M,"Everyone from every nation should watch this.
 It is what the atomic bomb did to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in world war two when they were bombed.  For those not knowing Japan started this war by destroying the Naval fleet in Pearl Harbor ??  I believe it was in 1941.  In 1945 the Atomic Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and the Japanese did not surrender so a few days later it was dropped on Hagasaki.  Watching this movie shows  just what dropping a nuke on a country does to the country and more important the people..  I am not saying it was wrong for America to do this.  A lesson was learned by all as to this is what Nuclear war would be like.  This is a story about the two towns with pictures of what it was like for the people.  There are Japanese people who survived that were young and talk of what it was like. Even if they were very young they still remember. Today the generations born after the war still suffer from the effects of radiation.
Those who talk of dropping a nuke on a country need to watch this.  Those who don't think about nuclear war need to see it.  It said at the end of the show today the world is armed with 400,000 times the energy of destruction that was done back in 1945 as more and more countries have developed nuclear weapons.
After you see this movie multiply the destruction by 400,000.  That is what it would be today.  Excellent documentary and a needed movie for our generation of 40 and under people in all countries including Japan.  People seem to have never learned what the destruction of a nuke an can do.  And seem to forget the destruction would be multiplied by 400,000.  That would be the end of mankind.  Eyes open people.  This is a movie to learn by.",1471996800,,1708,4.297805642633229
2869128,4,B000RL6G8M,"After watching this I don't think I will ever say ""just nuke 'em"" again.

2869223,3,B000RL6G8M,"The results of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were horrific, without question.  Future atomic warfare is unthinkable and all nations should elect to destroy whatever nuclear weaponry which is currently stockpiled.
My husband was a teenage combat rifleman in the closing months of WWII and awaiting further orders on the Philippine island of Mindanao after the Japanese military had been overcome  there.  His next stop would have been the invasion of Japan which would have taken place on the Japanese southernmost home island of Kyushu.  Unknown to most Americans, our General George Marshall had estimated that an invasion of the Japanese homeland could entail upwards to one million US casualties, killed, wounded, missing.  Instead, the decision to drop the two atomic bombs was made in hope and anticipation that it might end the conflict.  It did.  And my husband was saved from a sure and certain death or injury as a kid storming ashore on Kagoshima Bay, his outfit's designated landing area.  A reasonable and rational arguement  can be made that with the war ending, millions of lives had been saved as a result of the dual atomic bombings of Japan, both Allied and Japanese lives.  This documentary tells us about the absolute horrors suffered by the citizens of the two affected cities--and there is no disputing this--but it never brings to bear that in quickly ending the conflict, others were able to survive on both sides.  My husband never has talked about what he had endured in the Philippine jungle as an ordinary combat rifleman, nor could any urging allow him to do so.  His only comment has been:  ""I can't tell you.  Unless you were there, you cannot possibly understand.""
  His view, that he was able to come home eventually, should also be a factor in determining the rightness or wrongness of the atomic bombings.",1419552000,3,1848,4.951298701298701

And yes, I agree with Truman's use of it. It saved countless lives (estimates were for 1+ million US casualties to take the Japanese home islands). The culture was very fanatical and to invade the US would have to have killed far more than died in the two nuclear blasts/fall out. When put in the perspective of that many possible casualties vs casualties suffered from bombs it is a no brainer.

One of the things I was most fascinated by was the lack of anger directed at the American government for having dropped the bombs in the first place . . . instead the anger was directed at the Japanese government for having started the war.  Also I thought it was deeply sad that after suffering through what should have killed the survivors - the horror, the gore, the reality and nightmare that most of us can never truly imagine - that these people then faced discrimination at the hands of the government and their fellow citizens.

People who were there describe the event as they remember it, and I think they did a pretty good job.  JMO.  The same laws of physics that created us will destroy us.  At one point one of the narrators says ""I think it was my mother's love that saved my life.""  Really, that's our only hope, love; it's the only thing strong enough to overcome anything.

Unless we all agree to lay down our weapons we lessen, daily, the chances for species survival.  It won't be earthquakes or global warming, it will be us, and it won't be w/ a whisper.  Robert Frost said it perfectly, fire and ice, it will be both; as intelligent as we are, or think we are, our emotions still seem to rule us.  Mankind is going to have to decide whether it's ruled by reason or politics, logic or hubris.  I personally don't think we stand a chance.  This documentary can be the past or the future, probably both.

I do not recommend it for kids to watch but on the other hand thinking about the video games they have today about fighting, shooting & killing it makes them think that no one actually dies - after each game everyone ""re-spawns"" like nothing happened.

I think those dull their feelings and gives them the false reality that the violence is ok.

The movie has actual footage of Nagasaki one day after the atomic bomb exploded. The film is very much disturbing and at the same time you realize the cost of war. Nothing but death. It does not discriminate between men or women, old or young, adults or babies. They all suffer the consequences of other people's war.

One last thing that took me by surprise was that the people within the blast radius of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, a lot of them survived the initial explosion. I have always thought that they died instantly: a flash of white, a shockwave and then gone. It broke my heart to know that a lot of them actually survived the blast only to endure excruciating pain in the next few days and weeks. Most died but the ones who survived are carrying the scars and burden of a war that the young Japanese do not even remember.

Like many discoveries of science, nuclear energy can provide a great deal of energy with much less pollution than coal, but with the right knowledge, it can be deadly.  The fortunate thing is that it takes a great deal of technology to make the bomb (purify the fuel to that point).

Like that film this one will move you to tears. Both blame the fate that befell Japan on the Japanese military and the mindset of the Japanese population going into the war.

Enteresting too that this film also focuses on many of the American gestures of peace and friendship following the end of the war, including a segment of the TV series 'This Is Your Life' where a Japanese Catholic Priest from Nagasaki met in peace the Captain of the Enola Gay who had a hard time hiding his remorse at having dropped the bomb.

Sometimes I cannot believe the foolishness of some human beings. To have created a weapon of such evil, capable of wiping out so much, so easily. Nuclear armament must stop.

2869314,5,B000RL6G8M,"I have seen and own many, many documentaries on all kinds of subjects; war, music, science, WWI, WWII, art, biography, history, nature and politics, but WHITE LIGHT, BLACK RAIN: THE DESTRUCTION OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI is one of the most effective and gut-wrenching documentaries I have seen, or ever hope to see, on the horrors of war.  I literally sat in stunned silence for several minutes after it was over.

This emotional and graphic film expertly weaves a hard-hitting tale of suffering and terror.  The film gets its power from interviews with several survivors of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings, who describe in vivid detail what they saw the day their cities were bombed, what they felt and how they survived history's only nuclear attacks.  Most of the survivors are horribly scarred physically and emotionally, and even with years of treatment and plastic surgery, all are still suffering the pain and ill effects of those two horrible events.  One survivor removes his shirt to show us the still-shocking sight of his upper torso and arms, ribs caved in, sunken chest and skin still painfully scarred.  The narration is provided only by the survivors, which adds immensely to its effectiveness, although the screen is frequently filled with supplemental facts to ensure that the viewer is able to grasp the full impact of what happened on those early August mornings some 60-odd years ago.

In addition to the victims, several surviving members of the American bomb crews are interviewed, while archival footage of the actual bombings, the suffering, the injuries and the devastation are shown with no censure, in all their abject horror.  By and large, the survivors were mostly children at the time of the attacks, describing their frantic searches for their family or parents.  One tearfully describes finding her mother, barely recognizable and literally burned to ashes.  Graphic footage of the burn victims, many missing limbs, fingers, eyes, ears or noses, are examined by American and Japanese doctors shortly after the bombs dropped.  There is extensive examination of the attitudes of the conquered Japanese, and their subsequent renouncement of war.  We are told that many victims of the bombs blamed not their American attackers, but the Japanese government for starting the war, a war they were sure to lose.  We learn that large numbers of Americans gave of their time and money to help the survivors and provide medical treatment and plastic surgery.  We find out, while the tears build in our eyes, that even to this day, many of the innocent civilians who lived through the bombings are shunned and scorned by their own neighbors, perhaps because of memories that are too painful to bear, and many who still wrongly believe that the victims carry some type of contagion, even after all these years.  Above all, the film is permeated with heartbreaking stories of courage, loss and pain.  So much pain!

Brilliantly directed, produced and edited by Stephen Okazaki, the story is enhanced by an excellent soundtrack of moody music, which packs an emotional punch that drags the viewer into the horror and suffering.  Be warned; there are images so unforgettable you may not sleep for weeks.  This film is not for those easily disturbed, but should certainly be required viewing for anyone who thinks that nuclear weapons should ever again be an option.  As one of the original bomb crew of the Enola Gay puts it, ""When I hear somebody say, `We ought to nuke Iraq' I think, `That fool can't even know what nuke really means; if he did, he wouldn't say that"".  Exactly.  Above all, no one who views this film will ever see nuclear weapons the same way again.

The rest of the documentary focuses on actual victims and their testimony of the bombing, their life after and archival footage of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The documentary was well done, there was never any anti-American sentiment but some negative views of the Japanese government were expressed principally the WW-II era military government.  I presently work in Japan and have been to Hiroshima and the Peace Park there.  It is a very moving experience I hope to go to Nagasaki this year. The most humbling thing for me of that visit is the story of a very athletic and intellegent young girl, Sadako Sasaki a victim of cancer likely induced by radiation exposure she died in 1955, Sadako was 12, people should read about her will to continue life by folding over 1000 paper cranes even when it took her hours to do one because of her weakened body. Sadako and her cranes are now huge symbol of peace for children. The Japanese people do not like talking about WW-II because it was a horrific experience for them and totally altered the concepts and society of Japanese thinking and logic.  As a child myself in the fifties and a teen in the sixties and having served on active duty in both the USAF and US Navy for 20 years I can recall the fear of the possibility of total world destruction by a nuclear war. It was a very stressful period and that awareness was always at the back of many of our thoughts. The war had to end and in actuality the use of the bombs saved many more lives, that should not be forgotten either.

2869335,5,B000RL6G8M,"I had personal reasons for wanting to get out of the Army, even though it had given me a safe and easy job. The war seemed to be going on forever. If I had known beforehand of the existence of an atomic bomb that could end the war, my first impulse would be to use it.

President Truman was more reflective. He was a plain man, and had not witnessed an atomic explosion. His judgment used the number of lives, both American and Japanese, that would be lost or saved. He believed that the Japanese people would not surrender unless American soldiers fought to occupy all of Japan, with a huge loss of life. He concluded that lives could be saved by dropping a bomb on a Japanese city.

The scientists who had witnessed the first atomic explosion in New Mexico felt differently. Their leader, J. Robert Oppenheimer, gained an appointment with the President, and pleaded that a bomb not be dropped on people. (See ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer""). But Oppenheimer was excited, and made a poor choice of words. He said that he had blood on his hands. The President said that the blood was on HIS hands, and he must make the judgment.

As the DVD describes, there was a small medical study of the effects of the bombs on the survivors. Humans at ground zero were simply vaporized. I have read that some of them a little further out survived, but temporarily lost all sense of human kinship. They were just machines, running around desperately. These people should have been interviewed extenively. It's too late for that now. Most of them have passed on.

But White Light/Black Rain finally gives us the impressions of those who were only children in 1945. Morally and compassionately, its message is that atomic bombs must never again be dropped on humans.

But there is also a more ultimate message: Isn't it almost inevitable that a nuclear world war would be the end of our species and our world? Now it's hydrogen bombs rather than atomic, fusion instead of only fission. The arsenals of hydrogen bombs held by the United States and Russia would cover the world. A resurgent Russia is as ready as we are.

In the face of this threat, we recall the decades of peace during the ""cold war"". It was generally understood during that period that local wars would not involve nuclear weapons. A dangerous weakening of this is the study of ""tactical nuclear weapons"". That study should be terminated. There is no way to draw a hard line between tactical and strategic.

In international diplomacy, we should respect the Russian sphere of influence. Our attitude should be conciliatory rather than confrontational.

It is to be wished that politicians see and think about ""White Light/Black Rain"". Can they find time for it while concentrating on getting elected?",1221091200,15,2794,4.74639175257732

2869337,5,B000RL6G8M,"This is a really great documentary. It does not really go in to a great deal of political detail. Instead it focuses on the thoughts, feelings and suffering of the victims. It also tries to get an idea of the feelings of those who dropped the bomb. It is sad and atmoshperic and left me very moved. The original music is superb and adds to the melancholy air. The film introduces several victims from both Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their stories are breathtaking, but told without malice or anger, just a profound sadness. There is one victim from Nagasaki who describes his horrific burns as being so agonising that he simply wanted to die (many others begged to be killed also). He was a small boy when he suffered those terrible burns and he describes how the love of his mother gave him the courage to go on despite his physical disfigurement.

A very sad film, but one that should be watched.",1217721600,7,898,4.54320987654321

All from a single bomb that split atoms with a nuclear fury that very few live to tell about.  . .the people who did live describe the life changing event that altered their lives forever.  The disfigured child, now a women tells a haunting tale of the fantasy that will never be, a dream that she would have a husband, a man that she loves and to be cared for.  The film is enlightening in that you realize that the true horror stories are the people who lived for a few months after the blast. . days of hellish pain as their bodies gave in to the radiation and burns.

The footage of nuclear blasts changed the way I think about nukes. I always thought of a nuclear weapon as a ""bamb booom"" it's done, but I think it's more like an hellish burning earthquake that doesn't stop shaking for several minutes as the world around the bomb disintegrates.  And then for hours more every thing burns away. . .only the lucky children who could jump into the river survived to tell us the horror.

Absolutely shocking detailed documentary mainly focusing on the Japanese (with English subtitles), and what they had to deal with when they were children and the Hiroshima nuclear attack happened.

Let me tell you- this movie will absolutely shock you on several occasions, because it shows footage of the famous bombing incident in World War II, and you will get to know a few select Japanese people who were a part of the disaster and lived through it, with all the amazingly accurate and heartbreaking details revealing to us exactly what they had to go through.

It's almost hard to believe real people had to go through these horrible events and deal with diseases, their skin falling apart, and other major problems as a result of one devastating bomb.

It's a film worth seeing from a Japanese perspective, because for years we've all been seeing the American point of view of what happened that horrible day.  Now it's the Japanese telling their stories.  You'll get to know each one of them and listen to their incredible stories.  What they had to go through was just... unbelievable.

the entire thing is told from the perspectives of the survivors (who at the time were children) and also a few U.S. pilots that were involved in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

i recommend this film to everyone. especially to anyone who has ever said we should use nukes on other people. and the music is great (provided by mogwai).",1204502400,2,555,4.485148514851486
2869342,5,B000RL6G8M,"I had the good fortune of seeing this film at a movie theater in Japan when it was showing here in 2007, and just recently bought this DVD version. I have to conclude now, as I did at the time I saw it at the theater, that only Japanese-American director Steven Okazaki could have made this most excellent film.

As Okazaki has said in interviews, the Japanese people who became victims of ""The Bomb"" are no heroes -- just ordinary people like you and me who were going about their lives when they got unwillingly swept into the atomic age. Unlike most documentaries on this subject, ""White Light/Black Rain"" comes across as a warm collection of stories told by real people living real lives. As a viewer, you cannot help but be drawn immediately into their world. There are no fake news-media types, no melodrama, no special effects or animation here -- just simple storytelling by those on both sides of the atomic bombings.

The story ends with a particularly strong warning about Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, which is the only country in the world that has such a clause renouncing war forever right in the Constitution. The government of Japan, under continuing pressure from the United States, is moving to change Article 9 so that Japan can more easily  dispatch military troops abroad in support of U.S. wars. There is a real danger right now that Article 9 in Japan will be disposed of permanently within the next couple of years -- unless people in both the U.S. and Japan stand up in great numbers and demand that the U.S. and Japanese governments keep their hands off Article 9. Look into what Article 9 is, and raise your voice today to protect it.

It was very telling to me that mostly older people, the ones in Japan who remember what war really was like, made up the bulk of the audience in the Japanese theater where I saw this movie. I want to share this DVD with as many young people in Japan that I can, and would encourage other viewers, wherever they are, to do the same if they are moved by the message of ""White Light/Black Rain"".

The directing, photography, editing, music, translation -- all of it is well done in this film. It is the best documentary I have seen so far on the subject of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All that is left to say after seeing it again is: Thank you, Steven Okazaki, for making such an important documentary in these times.",1204243200,7,2385,4.537209302325581
2869353,5,B000RL6G8M,"Fabulous. Advisable for everybody who thinks nukes are useful. If you have seen this movie, you never want that anymore. Excellent documentary made by the Japanese themselves.",1199232000,3,175,5.518518518518518
2869354,5,B000RL6G8M,"Great movie.  Unfortunately there are a lot of ""College-Know-It-Alls"" these days who have no historical context for the nuclear bombings.  These people call the bombings a mistake or use them in some sort of twisted logic on how the US is no better than the people we are trying to stop.

The truth is the bombs we not designed to win the war.  We were leveling cities before Hiroshima with conventional bombs, often with a higher death toll.  The purpose of the bomb was to give a single plane the power to level a city rather than send a 400+ bomber formation to do the same job.  This would be critical if Britain had fallen and we lost the luxury of having close proximity air bases to Germany (bomb development started very early in the war).  Conventional bombings of Japan continued after both atom bomb attacks.  Again, there was hope that Japan would surrender after having been hit with an atomic bomb, but it wasn't a sure thing since we'd caused greater destruction through conventional bombing in the past with no sign of a white flag.

Hiroshima was not a military target in todays definition but had the ideal size and terrain to show the power of the bomb.  Leveling cities was designed to break the will of the people to not continue fighting the war.  In 1945, after years of war and 600,000 US casualties, (as horrible as it sounds) Hiroshima had become a military target.  Dropping the bomb was another call to Japan (as was the firebombing of Tokyo and other major cities) that continuing the war was futile.  With great enough destruction peace could become a reality.

Little was known about radiation that would come from the bomb or its effects on people.  Only one bomb had been detonated prior to Little Boy and that was to see if the device worked.  Even after knowledge of the bomb became front page news after the Hiroshima attack, a lot of individuals in the military just saw it as a really big bomb.  Some plans for the Japanese home island invasion suggested to drop a couple atom bombs on the beach, then send in the ground forces (showing little concept of how powerful the devices actually were and the complete lack of knowledge about fallout).

Some estimates put the losses for the invasion at 500,000 US servicemen and casualties for the Japanese in the millions.  Truman knew Americans were growing weary of the war after years of conflict and that if using the bomb in August of 1945 had even a slim chance of negating the need for the invasion in November of 1945, he had to take it.  I feel bad for the people who survived and those who died in the nuclear blasts.  Just like I feel for the individuals who died in firebombings in other parts of Japan and Germany.  I wish their countries had not made any of the bombings necessary.

I think everyone should watch this movie.  People would come away with a better understanding on why the US military is trying so hard to prevent nuclear/chemical/biological weapons from falling into the hands of people who place no value on human life.",1194652800,8,3032,4.592936802973978

You know the statistics, winds at 1000 MPH and temperatures at 9000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT at ground zero and everyone nearby instantly vaporized.  140,000 dead in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki. What we don't always remember is the story of those who survived. This is the story of 14 Japanese civilians who survived and 4 Americans deeply involved in the attack. Many of these stories have not been told before. I found their stories both tragic for what they have had to live through and with and uplifting because it also reflects the best of the human spirit in surviving unbelievable circumstances, much like those who survived the concentration camps. These people have lived with scars and permanent disabilities, abandonment by their own government and discrimination in the work place. At least an additional 160,000 Japanese died from complications of their bomb wounds and thousands committed suicide rather than live with the horror. But tens of thousands survived to tell their story and to remind the rest of the world about the horrors of this incredible weapon. Whether we have the weapon or oppose those who have it or trying to get it, no one must underestimate the horrors accompanied by the use of it. People will debate whether we should have used it. It did end the war and save potentially hundreds of thousands of additional military casualties but at a tremendous price. Perhaps if enough people will continue to watch this powerful film and others like it, we will not forget this horror and make sure this was the first and last time this planet experiences a nuclear attack. The nuclear weapons in the world today EQUAL 400.000 HIROSHIMAS-A VERY SOBERING THOUGHT.  The images of the destruction and mutilated and burned bodies (dead and alive) are very disturbing but perhaps we should all keep those images alive as a grim reminder of what these weapons can do.

2869358,5,B000RL6G8M,"This film is about the victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what they saw in the immediate aftermath and how they lived their lives afterward. It describes the destruction not through impersonal statistics but through horrifying personal narratives and chilling drawings of the survivors.

I am particularly struck by an account of a woman who describes how she, 6 year old at the time, and her younger sister touched the body of their mother and it turned to dust before their very eyes. It is experience like this that made many of the surviving children kill themselves.

Contrast with that is an American TV episode with a Japanese man who ran a charity for the victims. They had the captain of the very plane that dropped the bomb to come forward to offer a ""contribution."" Talk about obscene hypocrisy!

To make it short, anyone who suggests ""Let's nuke the Iraqis"" or makes similar statements should watch this first. In the words of one of the featured victims: ""This can't happen again.""",1190764800,4,1016,4.827586206896552
2869359,4,B000RL6G8M,"In our time, HBO has emerged as a serious player in terms of producing political documentaries.  Film after film, year after year, HBO keeps hitting home runs after the park.  In fact, HBO has become the Barry Bonds of political documentaries (i.e., it is difficult to keep track of all the excellent documentaries produced).  ""White Light/Black Rain"" is yet another home run from HBO in the documentary film leagues.

This film is difficult to watch, as it should be.  It is not for the feint of heart.  It discusses what Americans do not like to talk about in polite company, namely the fact that the U.S. is the first - and so far, only - country to drop atomic bombs on another country.  This documentary clearly paints a picture of the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  It pains a balanced picture as well.  It shows the pain and agony of the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - as well as of the men who dropped the bombs from the Air Force planes high above in the sky.  It steers clear of the rancorous - and endless - debates about President Truman's fateful 1945 decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan.  Instead, the film zeroes in like a laser beam on the effects of nuclear war on the civilian victims.  You will not quickly forget the unforgettable vignettes from this film, whether it be the ""Hiroshima Maidens"" of the 1950s, or the chilling artwork of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Watching this film is a good barometer on your own humanity.  If you don't look away at least once during the viewing of this film, or squirm at least once, or fidget in your seat at least once, then say to yourself ""Houston, we have a problem"".  After viewing this film, I will not sleep as soundly at night as this film marinates in my mind for the next few mind.  And in the dangerous post-9/11 world we live in, where nuclear annihilation is thrown about freely as a viable option by politicians and leaders from all over the globe, perhaps mandatory viewing of this film at the U.N. General Assembly would do more good than the typical bang-your-shoe bloviating that normally occurs.

People who hear of atrocities during wartime and say ""well that's just war"" need to see films such as these. These Men, Women and Children were not in the military. They didn't sign up to give their lives to this war. They were going about their business when they were bombed.

You know it was horrible by the fact that almost all the survivors said they were begging others to let them die because surviving was so painful physically and emotionally.

In U.S. public schools this topic is only mentioned as ""we bombed them and they surrendered"". It is swept under the carpet really quickly. Somehow by talking about what we did is seen as unpatriotic or something.

The U.S. dropping these bombs was a horrific act. We have to ackowledge that fact. Was it necessary? I can't answer that. It brought an end to a horrible war. Do the ends justify the means?

Hiroshima may have been a ""triumph"" for the US in the war, but it was most certainly a living nightmare to the innocent people that were caught in the destruction. I could not make it through the documentary without crying and most people tell me I am callous when it comes to expressing emotions.
