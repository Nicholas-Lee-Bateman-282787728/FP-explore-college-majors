8336452,5,B001QUXNMA,"ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.  This anime is a spicy blend of ridiculous, sexy, and weird.  Just plain weird.  From the creators of Excel Saga comes Puni Puni Poemy, a two-episode series with a loose ""girl becomes super heroine to defend earth from aliens"" plot.  It's meant to be unpredictable and whacky.  Just roll with it.  There's a talking fish sword thing.

Want to freak out your friends that are somewhat reserved?  Show them this anime.  Their reactions will be priceless.",1424131200,,470,4.923076923076923

8336456,4,B001QUXNMA,"Ok. First, I will say that this purchase of Puni Puni Poemy will be accompanied by another anime called Kekko Kamen that is about a naked female superhero who appears out of nowhere and I didn't even watch the whole first episode because it was so stupid.

Now, on to Puni Puni Poemy. This anime is one of the funniest, wacky, silliest, out of line anime I've ever seen. I watched this over and over and over again and it never gets old but I will say it's a bit hard to understand what Poemy/Kobayashi is saying since she talks so fast.

Poemy is like 9 or 10 years old but she wants to be a voice actress but after the death of her caregivers and a run in with a talking fish, she becomes a superhero. There's so much more going on but I want you to be surprised. One of the biggest surprises that made me look at the show in a completely different way is the age chart of the female characters which is located on the back of the case. Make sure you check it out before and after you watch it.

This anime is a great catch if you loved Excel Saga or just want to laugh. I would give this product 5 stars if it didn't come with the idiotic and unnecessary Kekko Kamen.",1386028800,,1170,4.078260869565217
8336457,5,B001QUXNMA,This is one of the most strangest anime's I have ever seen. It's probably the shortest. It's only two episdoes long. This came on time and it was in perfect condition.,1359590400,,167,4.419354838709677
8336458,5,B001QUXNMA,"This is a show that clearly likes to make fun of itself.  If you liked Excel Saga then you will love Puni Puni Poemy!  It manages to take all the funny of the Excel series and compact it into two all too short episodes.  Although you may think that two episodes is way too short, I am inclined to disagree.  After all, it would be difficult maintain this level of weird.  Beings as there is no plot summary, for those that do not know anything about the show:  Girl is unwillingly pulled into an attempt to save the earth from alien attack.  Mind you, this is just an EXTREMELY loose plotline and is an attempt to direct what could only be described as an acid trip gone very very wrong.",1323302400,3,687,4.2384615384615385
8336459,4,B001QUXNMA,"Poemy is one of those chicks who can speak like, a million words a minute. I remember renting this video from Blockbuster back when it was on VHS. It's just the right mixture of comedy and sexiness. If you liked the Excel Saga, you're going to like this. Mostly because the guy who created Excel Saga created this too. The only thing that sucks hard about this anime is that it's only two episodes long.",1307923200,3,403,4.386666666666667
