8706333,4,B00UGQB7GO,"This police drama that ran on ABC from 1982-85, and then on CBS in its 5th and final season, about a divorced Vietnam veteran, now renegade cop who transfers from investigations back to patrol to combat skyrocketing crime on the streets, along with the rookie often short-tempered patrolman, Vince Romano (Adrian Zmed), along with the help of the spunky Ofc. Stacy Sheridan (Heather Locklear), and often abrasive Ofc. Jim Corrigan (James Darren), and their often skeptical superior officer, Capt. Dennis Sheridan (Richard Herd).

TJ HOOKER also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it every Saturday night as a kid at 8PM right before watching LOVE BOAT at 9PM, and topped off by FANTASY ISLAND at 10PM on ABC, especially right after TJ HOOKER's debut in the Spring of 1982.

In the meantime, TJ HOOKER comes to Me-TV this Fall!!!",1502409600,,846,4.827586206896552
8706334,5,B00UGQB7GO,I thought TJ Hooker was a good show and I never missed it when it was on TV originally.  Now the first and second seasons are on DVD.  This is still a great show as it was then and NOW.  Will the next three seasons be put on DVD?  I am sure there are other people out there that remember this series.  I was in love with William Shatner back then.,1459468800,2,347,3.8309859154929575
