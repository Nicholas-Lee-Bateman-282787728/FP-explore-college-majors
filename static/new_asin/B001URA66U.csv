8344699,3,B001URA66U,"After watching about 5 food documentaries, they all seem to blend together.  Now that's not necessarily a bad thing as it will help reinforce concepts that you may not have fully grasped the first time.  I was surprised that this film actually was able to give me more insight and facts on corporate farming worldwide.  This film gave you more of a European perspective and how small, old-world style, food producers are disadvantaged because of widespread corporate activity.

It takes a nice honest and calm (not fuel for idle protesters looking for a cause) look at the cons of mega-producers in the global food landscape

The facts are good but the editing seems too slow at times, and the film quality doesn't compare to the artwork on the case (i know, it's just a baby chick on a yellow background but still).  Good stuff learned and not a waste of money.",1366502400,,862,4.675496688741722

8344701,4,B001URA66U,"IT ITS INCREDIBLE THAT WE ALL ARE GOING TO DIE SOME DAY EATING ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT THIS BIGGGGGGGG COMPANIES ARE DISTRIBUTING TO US.
THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO. THEY ARE TO BIG TO FIGHT WITH THEM. THEY OWN EVERYBODY. OUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT ALL THIS GENETIC CHANGES DON'T END UP CAUSING SOME KIND OF SICKNESS TO THE WHOLE WORLD; BECAUSE THEIR FOOD IS BEEN EATING BY THE WHOLE WORLD POPULATION.
THE ONLY WAY IS TRYING TO EAT """"NON GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD"""" WHICH IS COSTLY AND SOME TIMES IMPOSSIBLY TO FIND.
I WILL RECOMMEND OTHER FILMS LIKE """"BAD SEED"""", """"KING CORN """", """"BLUE GOLD""""(WORLD WATER WARS).
GOOD LUCK EATING ALL THE """"GM"""" CORN.",1282089600,,643,4.6
8344702,5,B001URA66U,"Privatizing public water for commodification, draining underground water sources faster than they can recharge, manipulating plant DNA and ""patenting food,"" CAFOs and the absolutely inhumane treatment of animals....  There are many good DVDs on these topics, and this is one of the better ones.  Not just addressing the issues, but naming names, graphic representation of tremendous waste, and out-there discussion on how these practices are affecting us, how these practices affect our environment, which then affects us...the vicious cycle.  It all comes down to money.  Bigger profits for the greedy corporation who exploit people, the environment, loopholes in the law, and how they are able to influence those in power--as well as disregarding and overturning legal policy in seemingly overnight maneuvers--for their own selfish gains.

I have watched many DVDs on the issues of food and water.  The best ones seem to be coming from outside the U.S.  This does not surprise me given the immense political clout and pressure these companies wield, and our government allows, with their mighty financial swords and legal wranglings.  The best U.S. productions have been ""Food, Inc,"" and ""King Corn"" (the latter is a bit hokey, but it gets better as the movie progresses).  Other than that, ""We Feed the World,"" ""Our Daily Bread,"" and ""FLOW: For Love of Water"" have been the best.  (I think the latter is Canadian).  Combine them, and you have some overlap, but a very comprehensive view of things.  I was a cautious label reader before, but these DVDs (and a few books) have made me rethink, and change, many purchases.  To be truly ""PC"" and ""MC"" (morally correct), avoid GMOs, bypass environmentally destructive companies, as well as purchasing only those foods that are nourishing, unadulterated, and organic will take quite a bit of research on my part, and additional work to combine the results, and I have no doubt I will end up with a very, very short list from which to shop.  Slim pickings indeed, but it is a task well worth undertaking.",1258416000,24,2050,5.0625
8344703,5,B001URA66U,"We Feed The World is an excellent documentary that shows us the current state of food production from the points of view of the farmers (in both industrialized countries and developing countries), small scale fishermen, the food distributors, the consumers, farm animals, and the multinational food production corporations. The current situation is insane.

We currently have some very undesirable situations with people starving all over the world and GM (genetically modified) crops quickly replacing natural ones on farms the world over. We are eliminating natural crops that taste better and may be better for us than the GM ones. One of the film's speakers, a representative from a multinational seed company, says that future generations of people may not ever know what a real tomato tastes like. Why on earth do food distributors find it necessary to truck tomatoes some 2,500 km across Europe? Why do we punish farmers in developing countries by dumping our excess produce on their markets cheaper than they can produce it themselves?

It seems like the only winners are the big multinational food corporations like Nestle Foods, whose president makes a speech at the end of the film saying that times have never been better. People have never had so much money. This is a great dvd to add to your collection if you would like a good overview about where we are and where we're going with regards to food production, distribution and consumption.",1243468800,27,1455,5.058333333333334
8344704,5,B001URA66U,"I saw this movie in a theater in Paris. It is a very powerful documentary on how agribusiness has highkacked and distorted the food we eat and privatized the water we drink and how all this is a huge waste of ressources and energy. The scenes with the discarded bread in Vienna, the vegetables being grown on no soil in the South of Spain or the CEO of Nestle speaking his heart about pay per drink water are unforgettable.",1215388800,2,423,4.367088607594937
