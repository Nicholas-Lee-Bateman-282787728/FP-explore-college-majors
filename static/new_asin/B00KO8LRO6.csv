8660383,5,B00KO8LRO6,"Are you dying?  Is someone you love dying?  If you answered ""no,"" allow me to congratulate you and your loved ones on their immortality. If you are like the rest of us, the unfortunate fact is that we are all dying; it's just a matter of when. Most of us would prefer later rather than sooner, but no matter how much we work to postpone it, sooner or later it becomes inevitable.

Depressing?  Not necessarily, at least if Gail Rubin has anything to say about it. In her TV series and companion book, she looks the Grim Reaper squarely in the eye socket, and confronts the reality of death with a smile.  She is a treasure trove of useful information when it comes to ""the party no one wants to attend."" and how to prepare for it.  In addition, she interviews world-class experts on the various issues, offering ethical, legal, philosophical, financial, and all-around practical advice on the subject.

So if you are immortal, go ahead and give this collection a pass.  For the rest of us, it's a must-see.",1406160000,,1006,4.55
8660384,5,B00KO8LRO6,"This series is an excellent resource for the college level Death and Dying class that I teach. Gail is the absolute expert in all things death. She displays a nuanced ability to effortlessly shift from the somber to the silly as she guides us through the various aspects of dealing with death, dying, funeral planning, bereavement, cultural norms, and even the paperwork of death. Yes, there's paperwork. Watch this series, read the book, invite Gail to speak at your next event. She is an experienced and entertaining speaker who will touch your heart and tickle your funny bone at the same time.",1405296000,,597,4.862745098039215
8660385,5,B00KO8LRO6,"I will watch Gail Rubin any time!  She brings her fun approach to life to the topic no one wants to talk about -- death -- in this series.  If you don't know what to tell your spouse or children to do when you die ... or if you're dealing with aging parents and don't know their post-death wishes, this series will give you plenty to talk about.  Thanks, Gail, for giving us more peace of mind about a very touchy subject!",1404864000,,422,4.121951219512195
