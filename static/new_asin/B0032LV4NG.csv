4060925,4,B0032LV4NG,"The story has been well reviewed already. I want to add that the element of faith in this movie is what makes it worthwhile to me. The soldier and the single mom have each been hurt by someone they loved and now, through faith that God has a plan for them, they learn to trust their feelings to another person again. The young boy has also found a man he can look up to and depend on, after being disappointed in the lack of caring shown by his own father. Stephanie Powers plays a woman who has experienced pain in her own past, and though they don't dwell on her situation long, the realization that her mother has been through it all before and still has faith helps Dana be strong.

It may be a predictable outcome, but there is substance to the message that makes it more than just another romance.",1274054400,45,803,4.282894736842105
4060926,5,B0032LV4NG,A Soldier Love Story is an awesome movie.  I have watched it over ad over on the Hallmark Channel.  Dana and Vince are a great couple together and Jared just adds that magic touch.  Vince and Jared are great pen pals and great friends.  The bond between them is real.  They show great compassion in a true friendship.  I hope that a sequeal is in the works.,1273968000,21,357,4.253731343283582
4060927,5,B0032LV4NG,It was a very well done love story that shows how you can recover after a divorce and learn to love again. It also shows the fears and frustrations many of our soldiers deal with being away from home for extended periods.,1273363200,23,221,4.285714285714286
4060928,5,B0032LV4NG,"L LOVE THIS FILM!  It's sweet and endearing.  The connection between the young boy and the soldier seemed was so heartwarming, and the drama of the absentee father brings great balance to this movie.  I absolutely loved the chemistry between the boy's mother and the soldier.  The centeral theme--love can overcome any obstacles in life--is a powerful one, and I think the element of faith just reinforces the central theme quite nicely.  I have to agree with one of the previous reviewer's comments--I'd like to see a sequel to this movie!",1272931200,97,540,4.8901098901098905
4060929,5,B0032LV4NG,"Loughlin (Dana) plays a young professional and single parent who went through a divorce and has custody of a 10 yr old son (Jared). Starting their new life they move 1600 miles from the only home Jared has ever known.
 Dana and Jared move in with Dana's mother played by Stephanie Powers. It was great seeing Stephanie Powers acting and offering light but powerful spiritual suggestions and at times great motherly and grandmotherly advice.
Dana is teaching her 10 yr old son some important life lessons that on occasion are spiritual. I love the way she teaches him to look for and be thankful for things they have. Spirituality is not over-done but instead very beautifully planted!
Dana starts a new job, Jared starts a new school and together they start a new life.  Jared's biological father moves far a way and makes empty promises to spend time with him.
 Randomly chosen Jared's teacher assigns the students to write a letter to soldiers. Jared writes to Sergeant Vince Carerra (played by Johnny Messner).  Vince a likeable but lonely soldier soon reaches out to 10 yr old Jared first through writing and then in person to offer some suggestions about playing baseball.  Vince soon becomes a positive male role model for Jared. Jared begins to like baseball with the help of coaching from Vince. It helps Jared develop friends.
It doesn't take Jared long to ""fakes an illness"" to set up time for his mother Dana and mentor Vince to spend time alone.
Sergeant Carerra is relationship shy --as is Dana. Vince, Dana and Jared spend time together and begin a unique bond.  For Dana and Vince loving one another becomes natural.

The real test comes when Sergeant Carerra is to be deployed unexpectedly and everything comes to a halt within 10 days.

Will Dana let go of the relationship that occurred so soon after her divorce? Will Vince let Dana go rather than dealing with the pain created by an ex wife?

Jared has been told the union ""ran out of time"".

Will Jared accept the sadness his mother's heart?

Lori Loughlin does a fantastic job acting as Jared's mother. Each time she is in a movie she just gets better and better. That was the first time I have seen Johnny Messner in movie. I enjoyed his southern accent not to mention how relaxed he appears through out the movie.

This movie was excellent and I would love to see a sequel to this movie. If you enjoy romance, family, and respect for our soldiers and not to mention a little religion/spirituality being a part of a real movie----this is a good one to get!",1272153600,384,2529,4.645739910313901

4060989,2,B0032LV4NG,"I am stunned at the high marks for this movie on Amazon reviews.  I am an experienced movie reviewer and this one is dreadful.  I like clean romances, so I was anxious to see it, but it was a big disappointment.  The first problem, not directly related to the film, is that Amazon puts the ending on the front cover of their DVD's which drives me crazy.  In terms of the movie itself, the acting is awful...even gagging at times.  I guess this is classic Hallmark standards, but I've seen several Hallmark movies where the acting is very good (""The magic of Ordinary Days"" or ""The Love Letter"").  But in this one, Laughlin is fake perfect, unrealistically smiling all the time.  Messner isn't too bad, but needs some work...and he is not a baseball pro.  Watch how he throws the ball!  The kid needs acting help, though he tried, and Stephanie Powers gave a sub par performance.  The military acting was unrealistic, for the most part, as well.  The plot has little suspense to it as you know how it will end from early on.  I must qualify that the plot had potential if the acting was better.  The movie summary talks about it being a faith-based movie, but the Christian impact was minimal and very shallow, and, of course, the name of Jesus is outlawed.  This was a low budget movie...you get what you pay for.  I appreciate the clean angle, but it couldn't bail out this one.  I give it a 2.1.",1494288000,4,1397,4.440944881889764

4061600,5,B0032LV4NG,"I had seen it on Hallmark Channel last year and loved it. A bit of tender romance btwn a military man during the holidays and a single mom raising a son in need of a baseball mentor who formed a friendship via a pen pal relationship with the soldier. Since it had all those aspects, wanted it as a gift to a person that loves all those aspects of sports, and military combined in a film. Perfect solution for a Secret Pal gift. Laurie Laughlin did a superb acting job and so did the child actor in this chick flick. Very touching family film.",1387065600,,542,4.221153846153846

4061703,4,B0032LV4NG,"This 2010 made-for-television movie presents no swerves to disconcert you, no offensive material to sully your senses. It's a Hallmark product, so you know where you stand, you soft touch, you. MEET MY MOM (also known as SOLDIER LOVE STORY) is wholesome, is family oriented and is pretty entertaining. The two leads have something to do with this.

Stationed in Bosnia on a peacekeeping mission, U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Vincent Carrera (Johnny Messner) is often ribbed by his fellow grunts for being always the odd man out during mail call. But then, one day, Vince's name is hailed and he curiously tears open the envelope. He proceeds to read a letter from some kid he had never met, corresponding with him on behest of a class assignment. Still, Vince is touched. And when his Bosnian tour is up and he returns stateside on leave to his home base of Fort Sebastian, California, he decides on a whim to drive over and drop in on the kid. And when I make mention that the kid's mom is a lovely recent divorcee and played by Lori Loughlin, well, you don't need a crystal ball to see where this is going.

37-year-old Dana Marshall (Loughlin) is still settling in from the big move from Iowa to California and into her mom's (Stefanie Powers) house. Dana's been fretting about her unhappy 10-year-old son, Jared (Charles Henry Wyson), who still pines for his absentee dad. When the sergeant becomes a regular fixture and a mentor to Jared, Dana feels the sparks. But she's cautious. Dana is concerned for herself but even more for her son. She's fearful that a relationship with Vince could only have harmful repercussions, seeing as how he's expecting an imminent deployment overseas, which would leave Jared once more without a father figure. Okay, this, to me, is a silly conflict, but maybe it's because I'm more of the ""Life is short; take a risk"" persuasion. I had to double check to make sure this movie was playing on the Hallmark Channel. I wanted a guarantee of a happy ending. But did this movie get the happy ending? Um...

You should see this one, see it with the fam. Sure, it's got a low-keyed rhythm, but it's still quite a pleasant watch. It doesn't insult your intelligence by being either too goofy or saccharine sweet. There are little moments that come off as genuine and that build up those connections between the sergeant and the Marshall family, all of them once lonely souls. As an ex-serviceman, I'm glad for those moments that give the viewer a peek into how tight-knit a community the military families are. I loved it that Vince introduced Dana and Jared to his military buds who then warmly embraced them as their own. The film is worth it alone for Loughlin and Messner's warm performances. Almost as much fun, though, is the father-son interplay between Messner and the kid actor Charles Henry Wyson. It's cool seeing Wyson's character go from awkward, insecure boy who couldn't throw a lick to confident starting catcher of his school's baseball team.

But a parting nitpick: In that kitchen scene, Lori Loughlin has sure got that fake keyboard typing down. Yikes.",1375747200,,3102,4.749536178107607
4061704,5,B0032LV4NG,"This movie was a good feel good movie from the start.  The soldier had no family so he was willing to spend time with this little boy and help him, while all the time he was falling in love with the boy's mother.",1375056000,,212,3.9302325581395348

4061776,4,B0032LV4NG,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Soldier Love Story was really quite clean. There was no language, violence, drugs or drinking.  There was cleavage and kissing and two people speak of the pain of divorce; a boy's dad who is divorced from the boy's mother is supposed to visit him but bails out and the boy is hurt.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.

I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and then bought the DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

I really enjoyed how after Jarod wrote to Vince in Bosnia (the first letter since his wife left him over two years ago) Vince really takes to the boy and when he returns home seeks him out and offers to help him play baseball.  Jared takes to Vince immediately, since Jarod's own father can't bother to call or come see his son.  Vince and Dana, Jarod's Mom, are immediately attracted to one another and as this new ""family"" draws together and Vince gets his orders to be deployed, Jarod helps his Mom and Vince realize that instead of breaking up they would be happier if they stayed together, because then she would know that he would be coming back to her and he would have someone to go back to.

It was a very good show, and the only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star was because I couldn't completely get into the story because I can't imagine having to send someone off to war and not see them for a year or more.  The ending was a little sad having to send him off.  However, I like how it shows the need for a family and how love can make a big difference.  It brings in the need to trust in God and that he has a plan for you.  And it didn't need to bring in anything immoral.  They had good family values.

Overall, I liked this movie and will watch it again.",1369785600,3,2034,4.153061224489796

4061801,3,B0032LV4NG,I think this movie had good intentions and it is a sweet story but it is extremely slow moving with pretty much the same scenes over and over again. Both the leads are attractive but not very good actors. The kid did a better job.  Stephanie Powers did a good job with what she was given to do which wasn't much.  I know this was intended as a Christian feel good movie and it fits that description but this type of movie can still be better done and better acted.

I wasn't sure why this happened, but for a military picture, it left me wondering throughout the rest of the movie...The stars are supposed to be in the upper left with the stripes on the right...The flag patches on their uniforms were the opposite...Once I saw this on each military man, I was left to wonder more about that patch than the movie!",1366675200,,486,4.7176470588235295

Sure enough - this is Meet My Mom, a movie I try to catch when it's on either the Hallmark Channel or Hallmark Movie Channel. Now, I can watch it anytime and without commercials at a great sale price. This is one of a handful of inexpensive movies which I picked to get up to the $25 for Amazon Free Shipping . I ended up with 5 really good  DVD items containing 11 movies and 22 TV episodes all for a price between $25 - $30. So, make a list of the TV shows and movies you like and go shopping on Amazon .

This movie struck me on so many different levels. I think this movie covered some of the many, many  highs and lows of the whole  military family. This is a family friendly movie. Seems this movie could be a good tool to teach people to live outside of their own world and realize that freedom is not free.

Received an email from Amazon (thank you Amazon!) about the movie, and after seeing it was rated five stars, decided to purchase it.  I am so glad I did!  What a great love story!  I have watched it over and over again.  That's how much I love this movie.  By now everyone knows it's about a single mother and her young son... and an army sargeant whose lives are all transformed by love.  The performances are outstanding and it was good seeing Stefanie Powers back on the small screen.

I really appreciate the spiritual aspect of the movie as well. And note to parents: you can actually sit your children in front of this movie...leave  the room...and not need an exorcist by the time you come back in!

I would love to see a sequel to Soldier Love Story, but I think too much time has passed for that.  But I plan to continue enjoying this one.  I think it's a real treasure.",1362355200,,936,4.3468208092485545

4061888,5,B0032LV4NG,"This movie has to be one of the best I have seen in a very long time and I watch movies all the time.  I can't tell you how many times I have seen it and never get tired of
watching.  The story of love that comes unexpectantly to two very deserving people is so
heart warming.  No sex or violence. A little splash of faith, just enough to let the viewer know people still believe and teach their children to trust.  This love story is so rare in this day.  I too, like another reviewer, wish there could be a sequel. The
continuation of a life with so much love and respect for each other.  Vince having to leave Dana and Jared when he has finally found the woman and yes, the son, he wants to spend the rest of his life with. The fact that they could part for a year without marriage or consummation of their relationship of a sexual nature made this more endearing to me. As I said, love and respect.  The movie did get me to thinking about the many soldiers who are serving abroad and have no one to write to them.  Perhaps the people reading this might find out how to correspond with one of them.  It doesn't have to end in a love story but would be so nice to have a friendship come about.  I'm going to start on that myself.  My son was a disabled veteran and passed away two years ago. I'll do it in his memory. Watch this movie.  I guarantee you will not regret it. You'll get hooked too. May I add something please.  Someone who reviewed this commented on the southern dialect of Vince.  Remember he said his daddy worked on oil rigs.  That's Gulf coast territory.  Southern accents are a little more pronounced.  I really don't think he overdid it.  I'm a southern gal and found it to be just right.  He really is a charmer isn't he.",1354147200,4,1744,4.167664670658683

Throughout the movie the color intensity kept changing. In the same scene the actors hair color would change dramatically. Stephanie Powers hair went from red to brown and back to red again in the same scene.

There were a few moments of a ""sharp"" picture then the movie would be grainy again and dark.

I don't think this is due to my DVD player or TV since I originally DVR'D the movie and had very sharp color.

Even though Jared was hurting, he still managed to try and be understanding when it came to his father's work. I love these kind of movies where they lean and look to God for answers. We really were put here for a reason. I love this movie and hope there is a part two with just as much passion for God.

4061955,4,B0032LV4NG,"After her divorce, Dana Marshall with her son, Jared, moved to California to live with her mother.  As part of a school project, Jared was to write a letter to a soldier.  His soldier was Sergeant Vince Carrerra.  After returning from Bosnia on leave, he decided to pay Jared a visit.  But the first person he meet was Jared's mother and something sparked between them.  However, due to past experiences, military and marriage don't mix.  Can Vince and Dana overcome this when he has to leave again?

This is the kind of romance that I would love to have.  I found it endearing that instead of focusing on sex, the story revolved around love and emotional aspects of a relationship.  Through the good and the bad, they supported each other and slowly, released all the old baggage of their old relationships.  There was no pretense.  Sgt. Vince Carrera, played by Johnny Messner, was a major sweetheart and so sincere.  I wish there was more guys like him in the world.  However, I wasn't a big fan of his accent.  It grated on my nerves at times.  Dana Marshall, played by Lori Loughlin, was an inspiration for keeping her life on track after her divorce.  The acting was well done and the chemistry of the main characters was plain to see right from the start.  I found their courtship charming, sweet and kind of funny at times.  For example, when he first asked her out and she cleverly avoided his kiss was absolutely cute.  The supporting cast was simply just as important and amazing in their roles.  Another aspect I liked was the slight inspirational overtones at the beginning, like things happen for a reason and not all new experiences are bad ones.  The only thing that bothered me was that I found the ending to be incomplete.  That's why I couldn't give it 5 stars despite how much I like the movie.  The ending is always important to me, whether in movie or romance novel.  I know it's campy, but I like an assuredness that they are officially together.  But don't let it turn you off.  The ending does wrap up all loose ends.

I would recommend this to anyone who loves sweet, uncomplicated movies, read romance novels or love an inspirational film.  This is a clean, wholesome movie that is perfect for the whole family.",1304553600,5,2238,4.583333333333333

When Dana (Main Character) thinks she will never love again here comes a new man who is also helping her son with baseball.  I am hoping that there will be a sequal to the movie it is that good and I hope that anyone considering this movie buys it.  It is a good family movie with values and fun and one that everyone can watch.  Unlike some of the movies that one could go and see.  Well worth your money for something that you can watch over and over again. It is a good movie to pop in and watch when you are having a bad day it will make you smile again.  I haven't seen a bad review on this movie anywhere.  I have purchased this movie at least 7 times and you can watch it on the Hallmark Channel under the title Meet my mom same movie.  I say ENJOY!!!!,1294099200,,1021,3.965686274509804
4061981,5,B0032LV4NG,I call this movie sweet because it is believable. The actors were perfect for their parts and the story line was just right. The little boy wanted his mom to have the soldier he had met through a penpal situation from school as a boyfriend. The soldier had offered to teach the child baseball and as a result he caught on fast snd was very good at baseball. Of course Mom and the soldier fell in love much to the joy of the little boy. The little boy made a terrific Cupid.,1293148800,,473,4.1521739130434785
4061982,5,B0032LV4NG,"I throughly enjoyed this movie. I grew up as a military brat. I have had to see family members off many times over the years. This movie does a good job with the military aspects that are in it.  I think that this movie is a great movie for the whole family. There is not the violence and sex scenes that a lot of other movies have in them. You do not have to worry about anyone seeing something that they should not in this movie. It is a wonderful love story that everyone will enjoy. If you have someone in your life that enjoys good, wholesome love stories then this is a movie they will enjoy very much.

She waited and God sent her a special, loving, individual to love her and her son. I read one of the comments about it was too much God in the movie. That was a sad comment without God we are nothing and without God we would have nothing. I know this was only a movie but in the real world I have seen women wait on God and he manifested an awesome plan for their lives. This movie gave me hope to trust again and I could watch it everyday. I am so glad Amazon has this movie. I am purchasing the movie!!!",1289260800,,659,4.0

I enjoyed the way the story line deals with the mother feeling unsure about dating again and how the son feels that his father doesn't pay any attention to him. I would highly recommend this movie.

I was moved on so many levels, by the soldier's kindness to the little boy. He becomes a great surrogate father and is very believeable in the role. And the romance developed beautifully and organically. It doesn't feel contrived as some movies do.

Of all the movies I have watched this year so far, this one is the best and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves romances. It is good clean fun, no foul language whatsover. A movie you wouldn't be embarrassed to watch with your grandmother or your kids.

Although the movie may seem simple to some people, in this world so full of worries and troubles, it is the type of movie that speaks about an ordinary life with ordinary problems but at the same time it shows us the simple ways that we can resolve our own.

to meet the young boy and spent time with him, especially since his own father didn't.  How sad.
I liked how the friendship of the mother and soldier grew to a romance.

4062084,5,B0032LV4NG,"This film is very uplifting.  It focuses on many obstables that people face.  Deployments, Single parenting, hardships of seperation and keeping love and faith alive. I thought the relationship between SFC Carrera and Jared was heartwarming because their friendship helps to keep Jared on the right path along with his religious beliefs.  Being a member and married to someone in the Armed forces deployments can be challenging.  This movie shows that hope is still alive to be with the ones you truly love regardless of where he or she may be.  I have been married for 5 yrs both being deployed several times but the bond we have share is remarkable and this movie helps to show that you can continue to do so whatever obstacle may come because you still know you will be with each other til the very end.",1281398400,,806,4.647887323943662

This movie is enjoyable to watch and there are enough kisses to satisfy any romantic without being either offensive or too minimalistic.  Lori Loughlin did a fine job of acting in the lead female role.  She has aged well and I find her more appealing the older she's gotten.  The lead male role was played by Johnny Messner--new to me though I had seen him in an episode of Chuck this year, unbeknownst to me.  He really hit the nail on the head with his ""southern accent"".  There seemed to be a lot of chemistry between the two of them.  I hope that he considers making more romantic movies in the future.  I've watched this movie many times since receiving it in the mail.  It will go down as one of my all-time favorites.  I'd love to see a sequel to this storyline.",1280966400,,939,4.3028571428571425

4062112,5,B0032LV4NG,"""Soldier Love Story"" is an excellent heartfelt film.  Most movies that involve the armed forces are about battles, war, and dying. Seldom do movies outline the personal life of our armed forces.  ""Soldier Love Story"" fills that need.

In ""Soldier Love Story"" Lori Loughlin plays Dana Marshall, a young professional and single parent who went through a divorce and has custody of her 10 yr old son, Jared.  Starting their new life, they move 1600 miles from the only home Jared has ever known.
Dana and Jared Marshall  move in with Dana's mother played by Stephanie Powers.  For a school assignment Jared writes to Sergeant Vince Carerra (played by Johnny Messner).  Sergeant Carerra writes the boy back and a positive relationship flowers.
During Sargent Carerra's leave he meets Jared and coaches him in baseball.
Jared is a ten year old boy whose dad doesn't even remember his birthday, so the Sergeant's attention helps the boy's self esteem, and catches the mother's attention.

Vince and Dana start to fall in love but since Vince is going to deploy and lost his wife on his last deployment, they consider just being friends.  The threat to this budding family seems to be the tendency of the military to deploy to foreign lands without considering  the family.  ""Soldier Love Story"" shows a healthy way families may survive separation.

The Soldier Love Story"" presents a slice of life that military families know well.  The  uncertainty that exist during a long war and its effect on families is seldom understood by civilians and politicians.  This film pleasantly presents those problems.  I highly recommend this movie.",1280361600,2,1629,5.0
4062113,5,B0032LV4NG,"This movie, shown on Hallmark Movie Channel as ""Meet My Mom"", is a heartwarming, family-friendly love story.  All of the players do an excellent job in creating their roles, especially ""Jared"", a truly loveable little boy who has a touch of the schemer in him (all for good, though).  Johnny Messner and Lori Loughlin are most appealing and believable as the couple who meet, fall in love, and then have to face an obstacle to their relationship.  Stefanie Powers is terrific in the role of ""Louise"" - the loving, feisty grandma.  This is without a doubt a 5-star movie - something the whole family can watch and enjoy together.

8387549,5,B0032LV4NG,"What can I add to the already terrific reviews of this movie? I can tell you that I bought the DVD and I never buy DVD's any more. That's how much I loved this movie! The cast shines in true Hallmark quality, but what really caught my attention was the lonely soldier plot. I have watched dozens of Hallmark movies due to an unfortunate year of on-again, off-again unemployment and saw that they rarely give the man's role any true substance. Usually the male lead falls in love almost immediately, has 1 or 2 quick conversations with a friend or family member about the female lead, and  then ultimately he realizes she is ""The One"" and they're engaged by the end of the movie. It's sweet and warm, but in a Valentine in middle school kind of way. In this movie, you actually get to see the man's feelings and his reservations about starting over after a lousy divorce. Bravo, Hallmark!

All the supporting cast is good. As a matter of fact, I almost always prefer the supporting characters in a Hallmark movie because they get to be funny, or snarky, or just more real than the leads. This time I found myself drawn into all the characters. I have liked Lori Laughlin in every Hallmark performance but if I'm being honest, before this movie I only ever saw her as sweet and kind, but not strong and independent like in this film. I didn't have to wonder why for very long. She is so good because her co-star Johnny Messner brings out the performance I never knew was in her. As Sgt. Vince Carrera he is a man's man with his swagger walk, stoic talk of deployment, solid work-outs in the gym, and a comradery with his platoon. But watch out for his flirty, flirty eyes, that deep gravelly voice, and the Gulf Coast Southern accent. More than once I made that goofy school girl ""I've got a huge crush on you"" giggle throughout this movie. Wow, what a shame that Johnny Messner is a one-hit wonder to Hallmark because by the end of this movie, you are craving a ""part 2"" like crazy!

Now then, let's get to the good stuff. You cannot fake chemistry in a love story. Oh sure the writers can create good dialog, the director and camera crew can catch the actors at just the right angle, her hair and make-up can be perfection, but if the leads don't have chemistry, it falls flat. Can't tell you how many times I've found that the build-up to the kiss was way better than the actual kiss itself. Not. This. Time! For starters, watch her reaction when she sees him for the first time through the front door screen. Bam! You'd have to be dead inside not to feel that charge between them. Then see how gob-smacked this big, strong man is when he sees her dressed up for their first date. Bam, bam! Now that's what I call a love story.

So buy the DVD or the download, make a big bowl of popcorn, get a nice glass of something delicious, and enjoy this movie..over and over again!",1527638400,,2873,4.384615384615385
