7927756,5,B00004YVDL,"I used to watch this a lot as a child. I especially remember being at my grandmas house.

Anyway - I got it because of 'old times' and I thought my son may like it. He likes the singing and things.
I have found it is particularly useful for getting my son to wind down a bit before bed.

The high energy music in Bob the Builder or Shuan the Sheep just keeps my little one awake and excited.
Bagpuss is just right for pre-sleep time. It even gets me tired!

I love the stories - they are very imaginative and make me laugh. You will be entertained! There is enough adult humour in there to keep you going.

Well worth getting!",1291852800,2,626,4.10655737704918
7927757,5,B00004YVDL,"In a BBC poll, Bagpuss was voted the most popular children's series ever, even though only 13 episodes were made back in 1974. It is a very gentle show of imaginative and witty storytelling based around the odd (and usually broken) objects that a little girl brings home to her toys: Bagpuss, the pink and cream striped stuffed cat, Professor Yaffle the carved wooden bookend bird, Madeleine the rag doll, Gabriel the banjo-playing toad who lives on top of a round tin, and the little cloth mice and their Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ. The atmosphere is quiet and thoughtful as the toys try to figure out what the objects are, and the music is usually English folk music. It's one of those shows that is somehow simple and yet complex - my one and a half year old, my six year old, and my husband enjoy it equally, and I think that if you are searching for alternatives to standard commercial modern children's programming (for example, if you are a Montessori or Steiner education family), I'm sure that Bagpuss and any of the other series created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin will be welcomed into your home.",1145318400,6,1122,4.671717171717172
