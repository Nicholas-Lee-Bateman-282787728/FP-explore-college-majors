4084547,5,B0038EWZT4,"I very much enjoy John Edward and wasn't really sure what this set was, but it was a great price, and since I do enjoy John so much, I decided to buy it. I was so pleasantly surprised! It's a huge set of dvd's. It includes the entire 1st season of the tv show ""Cross Country"", a 7 dvd set called ""Evolve"", which are DVD's of John explaining how to meditate, contact our spirit guides and angels, etc., and many great meditations are included. Then there's a 3 DVD set of private readings he gave to small groups of people. I don't believe these were ever shown on the TV show. Just a great set for the money!",1297814400,21,608,4.161016949152542

4084549,5,B0038EWZT4,"I loved the Evolve series. The series has helped my grandchildren learn to protect themselves (psychic-aly) :-) and has helped them grow their psychic gifts. It helped me with some questions I'd had about my own experiences. The set has helped me with my own readings.

 On a day that my granddaughter visited I played the DVD where he leads you to relax and picture your crossed-over loved ones at a gazebo. My 15 yr old grand daughter followed John's lead and ""saw"" her other grandmother. BUT she didn't tell me. She'd silently asked her grandmother to give her a sign that it was really her spirit she'd seen. Later we went to lunch and in the tiny cafe' someone's ring-tone went off with a bit of an old 1940's song. My grand daughter went pale and explained how she'd asked her grandmother to come through...it was granny's favorite song. My grand daughter knew then that her experience had been real and she'd met the grandmother who had died right after my grand daughter was born, a grandmother she'd never met before.

I read other reviews where people wrote that they didn't understand certain things John does in his crossing-over show. How does he single out certain people for example...he doesn't single them out. A strong spirit comes through and that spirit draws the psychic in a certain direction and sometimes directly at the person for whom the reading is meant. Most of the time it's like a three-way phone call. The series is great fun to watch and very healing. Of course a psychic is not a substitute for a grief counselor, not at all, but it is a very healing experience to the person hearing from their loved one, one last time. My grand daughter can tell you all about that! :-)",1369526400,5,1705,4.6019736842105265
4084550,5,B0038EWZT4,"this set is spectacular a must have for fans of johns and a wonderful introduction for those who haven't seen this amazing medium. i've seen him umerous times live and this captures that experience at it's finest. you'll love the readings and the meditations will help you to be a more calm, understanding and aware human being. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!",1338681600,3,348,4.915254237288136
4084551,5,B0038EWZT4,"This Set of DVDs explains I believe completely the answer to what happens to us after we Die. It's obvious also that society has  ""Kept Us in the Dark"" regarding this subject by both the Churches and other means. It's unfortunate that we have remained so Uneducated in this manner because I believe if more people knew the Truth about this it would be a big factor in changing our society For The Good.
I thank ""Amazon.com"" for making these DVDs available.",1322179200,8,456,4.560975609756097
4084552,5,B0038EWZT4,This is what I call a real bang-for-your-buck set.  John is an amazing teacher and Set is easy to followis and understand.  And you will probably adopt several of his ways of doing meditations.  Of course it won't make us a John Edward but it will help us on our own journey. And if you are visual like me then you will really find it to be good.  Sometimes we just want to kick back and watch a DVD rather than read a book so this was a nice change.  And by the time you have reviewed all the DVD's you will feel like John is family.,1315872000,8,534,3.953271028037383
4084553,5,B0038EWZT4,"This is the proof of life after death I have been looking for. This Show used to go on tv here in Brazil but at that time I did not give the much importance, now for me it is a treasure from where I can learn and make sure there is life aftter death.
This is not cold reading in any way as sceptics say, all people interviewd cry like you never saw any hollywood actor cry, at least they all deserved an OSCAR...

I belive in John Edward's abilitie 100% !!!!",1313712000,11,458,3.9782608695652173

4084555,5,B0038EWZT4,"This is such a gem--so much information.  I love John Edward and the Evolve program is great--helping guide you how to tap into your own intuition or psychic abilities.  I also love watching the Cross Country program---it gives me hope and is very refreshing.

I have seen John Edward live 2 times and highly recommend his work.  He really is genuine and the real deal.",1302220800,7,369,4.630769230769231

4084557,5,B0038EWZT4,I was extremely pleased with my recent purchase of Evolve with John Edward.  It is cram packed with merchandise.  The Evolve DVD's are refreshing and thought provoking.  I love the meditations provided within.  Having never meditated before I was stunned by the stress reducing power of the excercises.  I was delighted with the price of this item listed on Amazon.  The Cross Country season DVD's were just a nice added bonus to this gem of a find.,1298332800,13,449,4.766233766233766

8391292,1,B0038EWZT4,"The Guy's a Hack, this is for ""believers"" only. Every one of his tricks can be explained as intelligent guesswork--knowing your audience, sizing people up--and getting people to ""fill in the blanks"" for themselves (this is a well-known magician's skill called ""cold reading"")--other impressive events may be the result of information gleaned surreptitiously (""warm reading""), though this certainly isn't essential to make the kind of impression J.E. is talented at giving.

Spend your money any way you wish, but I do hope you won't teach this as a ""life skill"" to children, as at least one of the reviewers appears to be doing. All the best...",1475712000,,644,5.0754716981132075
8391293,5,B0038EWZT4,"This is an amazing and comprehensive set of DVDs of John's Cross Country TV series. I am looking at these DVDs every chance I get, and it will take a while because there are a lot of them! Excellent value for the money, but even better than that is the message that John keeps delivering over and over: Death is not the end. We will all be reunited someday after this physical life is over. The sweetest part for me is that our dear animals cross over too and are with us in the afterlife. It would not be heaven without them!",1468022400,,526,4.166666666666667
