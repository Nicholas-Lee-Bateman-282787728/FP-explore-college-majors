8390812,5,B0037VM908,"Greek-born, Marin County-based Iasos is a composer, musician, and visual artist. He has been creating and presenting sensational multi-media shows for nearly four decades. Iasos is one of the founding fathers of New Age Music -- though the quality of his music transcends the genre.

""Realms of Light"" is the culmination of his life-long development as an artist. Melding his music with his vision, Iasos has created an utterly ecstatic experience of sound and light. The DVD consists of eight pieces each of which combines Iasos' music and moving images. A much-needed ""33 Second Intermission"" divides each of the pieces. The DVD offers the viewer a choice of Stereo or 5.1 Surround. Iasos creatively addresses the issue of copyright in a coda entitled ""Permission to Copy.""

After seeing ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" 11 times at a `Cinerama' theater, I developed the yearning for a multi-media experience divorced from narrative -- to put it bluntly, I wanted a purely pleasurable sensational experience. ""Realms of Light"" is the first piece I've seen that completely addresses my hunger for a beatific, transcendent media experience. If I was an old-fashioned, cigar-smoking Hollywood mogul I'd gruffly yell to Iasos, ""I love your stuff, kid. Here's a gazillion dollars. Go, re-author this thing for Blu-ray, and while you're at it, let's release it for IMAX, and, oh yeah, gimme some more."" Just as I could not have imagined the beauty of ""Realms of Light"", I struggle to imagine what can possibly transcend it. But if anyone can do so, Iasos can.",1294358400,2,1546,5.0588235294117645
