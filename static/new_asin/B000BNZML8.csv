8089641,5,B000BNZML8,"Have worked out off-and-on for 20 years to Karen Flores. Recently rediscovered tape. Since I am retired now (69 years), I workout 3-4 times a week but w/o the step. Can still do all moves easily and still say after each work out, ""THAT WAS GREAT!"" I absolutely love it. Hope she sees this.",1332460800,,289,4.37037037037037
8089642,5,B000BNZML8,"I painstakingly went through all of the offerings for a step aerobic workout and chose STEP INTO FITNESS because I wanted a low impact (I'm 60), and not a fancy, swirly, dizzying workout.  I already work with weights and a treadmill.  I just wanted something a little different.  It's EXACTLY what I was looking for.  A nice warm-up, great workout and cool down.  I don't do the rest of it, which is upper body and more, because I get that from other sources.  Perfect for the beginner...but you'll break a good sweat too.  Christian music, but it sounds like rock 'n roll to me!  Enjoy!",1144368000,,587,4.523809523809524

8089644,1,B000BNZML8,"I *hated* this video. I had no idea when I bought it second hand that it was a Christian exercise tape; I don't have a problem with that, but I do have a problem with the fact that the package doesn't tell you that so that if it isn't your thing you can bypass it. The music was sappy and the moves were boring. I couldn't wait to unload it! I prefer more energetic, upbeat workouts. If you like laid back, then this is the tape for you.",1099267200,2,437,3.977272727272727
8089645,5,B000BNZML8,This tape has been out for a while.  The best part of this tape is the spiritual music.  It seems to subliminially get one through the workout and feel better all over!,1006387200,5,168,4.21875
