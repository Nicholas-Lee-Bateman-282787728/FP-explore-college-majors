8588311,5,B00D1D7ZWO,"Good story, based on popular book, about the girl in pre WW2 Warsaw, trying to make a carriere dancing in the chorus line in Variette teathres. The film is in Polish with optional English subtitles. It's done for the television about 40(?) years ago on a small budget. But since I liked the book and I found this movie close to the story line.",1424649600,,343,4.375
