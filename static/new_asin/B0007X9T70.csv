2247730,5,B0007X9T70,"The best and most moving Parsifal you will see.

Matti Salminen is simply terrific as Gurnemanz.  While the voice may be a hair less gorgeous than 20 years ago it is wanting for nothing. Salminen remains a formidable stage presence and his grasp of Gurnemanz is complete. Even a slight grandiosity and arrogance in Act I cannot diminish the role's sincerity.  Even as he watches the Grail Ceremony this Gurnemanz gives off an aura of superiority - even over Amfortas and Titurel. His transformation in the third act - fervent, wise fervor and in his wisdom, possessor of a truly inspiring humility and sense of order. It is a miracle of a performance . . . just amazing from every aspect.

Christopher Ventris is the most remarkable Parsifal I've encountered and plays him exactly how I've always felt the role should be played. This Parsifal is a wild child/animal boy in the extreme and Ventris looks terrific in his amalgamation of skins, sticks, enormous leather breeches, face paint and thick-as-rope coils of dreadlocks. Initially I had reservations about his sound - light textured . . . almost boyish - but my, oh my how this singer captures this character in every nuance and gesture, facial expression and body language and movement.  Indeed Ventris's rare physicality almost defines the role in its totality. Where most Parsifals in the Act I Grail ceremony are directed to remain still and out-of-the-way, this Parsifal is climbing over every surface of the stage, examining everything and everyone:  entranced, amazed and full of awe at the wonderment of all he is experiencing. I can't imagine Ventris's Parsifal being bettered.

Later, following ""The Kiss"" we witness Parsifal's shock and Ventris makes it a palpable experience of shared epiphany. All is made clear and he knows what he must do and the direction life now takes him. This is, of course, all there in Wagner's score, but Ventris, almost more than any Parsifal I've heard or seen, gets this across and it's an emotional, cathartic moment.

I've always felt that after his feet have been washed in humility by Kunrdy, Parsifal must remain barefoot for the balance of the opera.  Too many Parsifals (including the Met's) don him in kingly/priestly garb, and I find this the wrong direction for this character.  I've always believed Parsifal should be almost bared at this point - bringing a true sense of humility and openess as the realm of the Grail moves into another dimension, another ""being."" That Ventris, stripped of armor, and barefoot enters the temple and performs the rites this way is EXACTLY right! (Siegfried Jerusalem's early Bayreuth Parsifal in the late 70's also remains barefoot for the ceremony).

Waltraud Meier knows Kundry better than any singer alive. It might even be called her signature role. While the very top of the voice can be a little wild - tight and constricted - it is only those notes - which she still can it. Actually the upper range of her voice works well and, as already stated, she knows what this character is all about.

A giant giant eggshell/cocoon apparatus comprises the first part of Kundry's costume which dominates and then transmogrifies throughout Act II.  Next is an 18th century looking gown, which leaves her inert and unable to move - which is finally shedded revealing a simple (and sweat stained) shift laying Kundry down to her bare essence. Powerful, powerful imagery.

Tom Fox's Klingsor is creepy, larger than life - almost Kabuki in its intensity. Suspended - balanced in some bizarre glass circle above the stage it lends a really sinister air to the proceedings.

Thomas Hampson is just a touch light of voice for Amfortas - but for once, it doesn't matter a whit. He is inside this role and I couldn't keep from crying at the torture - this eternal night of woe this King must endure. Hampson brings a sense of tragic horror to the role that adds yet another layer to this complex character. His sense of wonder and release, finally able to die at peace, released from the curse of his wound is profoundly moving.

I found myself crying - as I have since my first Parsifal at 14 years old.  But this time by the end I was sobbing out loud.  I probably would have held it together seeing this in the theatre, or in the company of others, but I'm glad I got to watch this all by my self and fall apart just as this work demands of me.

Nagano leads such a magnificent performance with nuances and shading that are rare indeed, not just in Parsifal, but in any work. The responses from the chorus and orchestra - the differences between even pianos and pianissimos is astonishing and add a gauze like delicacy in sections that make the score all the more moving.

fair.

I usually prefer my Kundry to die. I don't think it's a Victorian ""judgment"" call - it's what she wants. It's what she's waited for for centuries. Release and to sleep without waking.

I like the direction Lehnhoff takes this production. There is a sense of having to move on to keep the brotherhood of the Grail alive. We can sense the fetid stagnation of the present condition of the Knights. In the Act I ceremony the contrast between Parsifal - so youthful, so alive - with the Knights grey and stiff, could not be more vivid. Yet, the Grail sustains them still and the beauty of the ritual remains evident and enthralls Parsifal - even without his understanding.

Kundry does not die here, but rather leads Parsifal, and eventually we see the Knights, one-by-one following them down abandoned railroad tracks into the unknown, a procession into another realm, another order as Wagner's postlude offers promise, hope and redemption. An utterly beautiful ending which makes great dramatic and philosophical sense.

How special and rare it is to experience a production of so familiar a piece that continues to work on such a cathartic and profoundly emotional level - yet equally challenges and stimulates the mind as to its meanings.

This may easily be the finest, best produced and most satisfying opera on DVD I possess.",1116806400,113,6041,4.791145332050048
2247731,2,B0007X9T70,"I can't understand how other reviewers can be so praiseworthy, but then again, I've only managed the first act - if that. Talking to a guy who works at a classical music shop in Sydney, he said most 'modern' productions tend to just dress the characters in grey overcoats. And this is no exception. I prefer the 'traditional' staging of any opera, simply because it doesn't clash with the tone and style of the music. When you have this lush, rich, beautiful music, oughtn't the staging match? Here it seems the music is an intruder on the directors 'interpretation', which is really just his own need to be 'different', but in fact is nothing special. That, or the music who we are supposed to listen to, and the staging is in the way. I think the former. Contempary music for contemporary staging. Neither would interest me in any case. Therefore, 'classical' staging for classical music. This does not mean a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of an original performance (i.e. Bayreuth 1876/1882), but a 'faithful' rendition of the music (hence, 'acts of music made visible').

Unfortunately I can't recommend any other Parsifal, as this is the only one I have seen, but I'm going to try the Levine/Met production, which will probably err on the side of raw, but that is always better than being overcooked, which this one truly is.",1147132800,23,1335,4.656779661016949
2247732,5,B0007X9T70,"Wow!

Magnificent singing from the great Meier and Salminen as well as from (the previously unheard by me) Christopher Ventris. I agree with others here who have remarked on the disappointing lightness of Hampson's voice in the role of Amfortas. Yes, he gives a WAYYYY better performance (he can, after all, carry a tune, for crying out loud!) than that dreadful one by Bernd Weikl on the Met DVD, but anybody who's known and loved the audio versions with Jose van Dam will probably never be satisfied with anyone else in that role. In any case, however, I'd much rather hear an Amfortas with a heftier voice that gives greater attention to the dynamics and really brings out the incredible beauty of his music.

Hampson's acting, on the other hand, was up to the extremely high standard by the other principals.

Oh, and I loved Tom Fox as Klingsor, too.

As to Nagano, I am not convinced that he understands this opera at all. There's just no passion or subtlety or magic to his direction. Competent, yes, but no more than that. I saw him do Parsifal twice this past season in LA and was not particularly impressed, but I thought at the time that the problem sprang more from Robert Wilson's production than from the pit. AFter viewing the DVD, I'm persuaded that Nagano is only slightly less clueless than Wilson when it comes to connecting with the audience in this piece. I'll take Levine, Barenboim, Boulez any day.

The third disc contains a special feature called Parsifal's Progress--interviews and such. It's mostly a lot of drivel, in my opinion. Lots of patter from director Lehnoff and the choreographer about why the flower maidens shouldn't be too seductive (puh-leez!)and why having Kundry and Parsifal walk out of the Grail Castle leading a bunch of the knights along a railroad track is an improvement on--or at least a defensible interpretation of--Wagner's ending. Singers Hampson, Ventris, Meier, and Fox are interviewed, but shed little light on anything and frankly sound like they're blowing a lot of smoke. There was no interview with Matti Salminen. Smart man!

There were many things about the production that I loved, and like at least one other who has posted here, I too was often overcome by the beauty of the singing, acting, and--well, just by Wagner's music. Okay, some of the show was laughable: Meier, for example, in Act II, singing from behind something that looks like a giant pumpkin, then falling to the stage after the kiss and doing some kind of imitation of a broken mechanical toy that can't right itself, then wriggling out of a stiff skirt so that she can finally move normally again. Where, in heaven's name, do they come up with these ideas? It's a testament to her, nevertheless, that she transcends all silliness of staging with the brilliance of her interpretation of Kundry.

Bottom line? I 100% recommend the DVD. The insults to Wagner and to the intelligence of the viewer are not negligible, but don't deny yourself the truly excellent elements of this video.

(On the other hand,if you want something TRULY great, get the Barenboim audio CD with Jerusalem, Meier, and van Dam.)",1144713600,16,3134,4.823091247672253
2247733,5,B0007X9T70,"This production removes all the traditional straightjacketing from this opera.  The end result is stunning.  It is the most moving production of this opera I ever seen.

Here, Parsifal is young and virile.  Ventris's performance is nothing short of remarkable and he is joined by a crew of committed singing actors.  My only reservation is Hampson whose voice is rather light for the role but like his colleagues, his performance is strong and convincing.

I have to admit that over the years I have grown bored with this opera but this DVD has renewed my love of Wagner's final opera.

The audio and video quality are of the highest standards here.  There are two in-depth analysis included in this three DVD set.  The first, a synopsis of the story and on the third DVD, there are extensive interviews with the cast, conductor and producer.",1139011200,14,842,4.791666666666667
2247734,3,B0007X9T70,"After reading the other rave reviews here, I was ready to love this DVD. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The singing is generally of high quality, especially Matti Salminen. Waltraud Meier in Act 2 is dramatically very strong. Thomas Hampson's voice is too light for the role of Amfortas, but it works dramatically in the production's overall concept, which is that this king is hated for his weakness. The big letdown comes in Act 3, which simply did not deliver for me. A surprise which other reviewers didn't mention is that Amfortas dies in Parsifal's arms in this production, then Gurnemanz is left holding the spear, while Kundry leads Parsifal and a few other knights down a traintrack. The ending struck me as much more ambiguous than others found it. This is not an apotheosis of radiant healing. Instead, we're given a dark ending to the troubled reign of Amfortas and a movement toward a world outside this kingdom of darkness. Lehnhoff says in his liner notes, ""Amfortas' wound is... the wound of civilization."" Judging by this staging, it is a terminal wound, and the healing of civilization comes through its own demise. It seems to me, Wagner's music offers a different message. I was able to go along with the postmodern revision of the staging up until the last act, but the ending left me feeling like I'd been tricked by a cynic who was pretending to offer a tale of hope.",1133740800,45,1394,4.764462809917355
2247735,5,B0007X9T70,"Wondrous.  Simply wondrous.  I wept through Act I and through a big chunk of Act III - and I've been loving this work for 40 years.  Wondrous, simply wondrous. Historical

2247736,4,B0007X9T70,This is an excellent modern production. It strays from the original only in the ending. It seems impossible for a modern director to conceive that Wagner knew what he wanted. Parsifal becomes the new grail king; he does not wander off into the light with Kundry. But whatever. The singers are all great here - probably the best we could hope for today. And they act as well. The only minus I would give the musical side of things is the orchestra. Kent Nagano turns in a swift Parsifal. It does not seem rushed but I felt the lack of a certain bloom to the orchestra. The production itrself certainly emphasizes the waste land. Not even the Good Friday music brings a bloom to the landscape. But it is well thought out and brings the story to life with many insights. All in all this is an excellent Parsifal but it is not transcendent - and that unfortunately is demanded in any Wagner production. Given its creakiness I would still stick with the Levine MET performance for the weight and heft this performance lacks. A great second Parisfal. But if you're having only one.  . .,1125792000,33,1080,4.510204081632653
2247737,5,B0007X9T70,"The basic idea of this production is that redemption lies in good actions rather than piety and ritual (faith). Thus, we see at the beginning that Amfortas is self-absorbed and left unattended by his followers, the squires are mad at Kundry, Gurnemanz is mad at the squires, everybody is mad at Parsifal, and the Knights of the Grail are only interested in their ritual. Parsifal (in contrast to all other productions I've seen) actually shows a great deal of curiosity during the Grail scene, but ""doesn't get it,"" which is wholly appropropriate, because the point is not the Grail ritual itself but Amfortas' suffering. When Parsifal finally does get it, he becomes the moving force. At the end, after restoring the Montsalvat crew to some semblance of normalcy, Parsifal and Kundry exit, presumably to perform good deeds elsewhere (performing good deeds being the reason why we would care about the Knights of the Grail in the first place). Gurnemanz is left behind as de facto head man.

What is not clear to me is why Kundry not only survives but goes out into the world, and does so ahead of Parsifal. The Kundry character seems to me to have been intended by Wagner as a counterpart to Amfortas. Although it is true that one of Kundry's aspects is to perform good deeds, that was also true of Amfortas before betraying his calling and suffering his wound. And Kundry is extremely passive during Act III. This aspect of the production appears to me to be super-imposed PC. The female principle lies in the Grail itself, which, as at the end of Goethe's Faust, is a kind of prime motivating force. But perhaps this is too abstract or symbolic for contemporary audiences, so that the female presence has to be presented in a more explicit fashion. In any case, no production can do justice to all of the strands in this work. At least all of the characters in this production act believably as human beings, as opposed to being archetypes or mannequins.

The performers are all good to excellent actors. Ventris (new to me) was a great surprise. Waltraud Meier is predictably great (although she was greater in a production conducted by Barenboim on LaserDisc). It's nice to have a Gurnemanz who has the low notes, and a lot else besides. They all sing well, altough Fox is somewhat hard-sounding.

I'd like to praise Nagano's conducting. Yes, it's generally fast, but it is totally unlike Boulez, who I consider to be a dreadful Wagner conductor. Unlike Boulez, Nagano is flexible, allows phrases to breath, slows down or becomes expansive when appropriate, and does not shortchange the climaxes and moments of inward intensity. I like the way the flower-maidens chorus (not a musical highlight, in any event) is rendered, so that it is not sleep-inducing. In any event, Nagano's conducting serves the production. Thus, the opening scenes of Act I, rather than being ""dead"" (as are usually the case), are full of the energy that is inherent in the human conflicts taking place. Parsifal is a drama after all; the ritualistic aspects of this work are a means, not the end.",1125532800,29,3076,4.810964083175803
2247738,5,B0007X9T70,"This outstanding DVD reinterprets the story without veering from the intent.  The psychological and philosophical aspects are in the forefront, in a post-apocalyptic world.  Everyone shines in this never dull opera...in spite of its length.  The extra features are great, something rare in opera DVDs:  A thorough synopsis, and an analysis of the work, largely by members of the cast.  The booklet is also excellent.  I'd have liked more information on the vision of the director.  Technically it doesn't get much better, and the music is thrilling.  The stellar cast is perfect in their roles (My only concern was Kundry's first appearance--I thought for a moment that she came from the cast of Cats).  >Bottom line--this is a MUST for anyone who appreciates Wagner.",1123027200,19,767,5.120967741935484
2247739,5,B0007X9T70,"With an all star cast and every  member of the cast giving their all, this is an impressive production. While Salminen,  Meier and Hampson sing impressively, Christopher Ventris is brilliant. He is a young and hyperactive wild man in a world of the sick and infirm. His activity level makes the staticness of the other characters into an asset.

The production is modern, but intelligent.  It avoids the ""look at me I'm a wild and crazy designer"" problems that afflict many European productions. Whlie one might not agree with every  design choice, there is a clear point of view and the production works visually and dramatically.

The quality of the audio and video recording is first rate.",1122681600,11,692,4.871794871794871
2247740,5,B0007X9T70,"The singing throughout is outstanding: Salminen has rarely been more effective, likewise Meyer, Fox and Hampson; Ventris is a very moving, soft-spoken Parsifal.  The various concepts involved in the staging are fascinating (Kundry as redemptive force, etc.) even when they don't totally work (why is Klingsor a kabuki actor?).  The end result is just amazingly gripping and makes returning to the traditional Met Opera/Levine staging seem strangely dull and out-dated.  Nagano conducts at a speed equal to Boulez which turns the opera from a dirge into a dramatic force.",1117411200,36,570,5.382022471910112
8053130,1,B0007X9T70,"Director Nikolaus Lenhoff took the liberty of removing about 30% of the Wagner's music, removing almost every reference to religion or spirituality from the composers last opera. Herr Lenhoff also removed most of the wonderful choral music to accommodate his personal anti-spiritual, post-apocalyptic and anti-religious statement (explicitly stated by him in the extra content). My old time friends were very surprised when I said Parsifal was way below standard compared to the Ring. My poor judgment was based on this horrible version.

I am deeply surprised that Ken Nagano would compromise his artistic stature with such atrocity. If something is left after the amputation are the voices of Matti Salminen, showing the effect of age, and Waltraut Meier, specially her 2nd act.

My copy of this debased Parsifal went to the trash yesterday, after I returned home from the Met's transmission of their complete Parsifal production with Jonas Kaufmann in the title role.

I think producers and stage directors can take liberties, but to butcher a masterpiece is not an artistic liberty, it's a sin, and most of all, is senseless stupidity.

8053131,1,B0007X9T70,"I bought this based on the recommendation of a music magazine.  I watched it twice but found it aggravating, to say the least.  For instance, in the third act, Gurnemanz explains why Nature is not sad on Good Friday (""Du siehst, das ist nicht so...""); he sings beautifully about grasses and flowers, but there is hardly a blade of grass in sight. It is all concrete.  Also Thomas Hampson's Amfortas got on my nerves; he suffers just too much to be credible (I felt absolutely no pity for him, on the contrary).  And then, of course, it all ends up with Kundry on the railroad tracks... Symbolic perhaps, but mostly ridiculous!

I thought of donating the DVD to the library, but then I realized that I could trade it in. I got $8.25 for it, and promptly bought another Parsifal: the one from Bayreuth, staged by Wolfgang Wagner (with Siegfried Jerusalem, Bernd Weikl, Matti Salminen, Hans Sotin and Eva Randova).

8053132,2,B0007X9T70,"The only thing that might prevent a fervent Tolkien fan from appreciating Richard Wagner's ""Parsifal"" is the music. Oh, and the fatal absence of on-stage action. This is a tale of knighthood in which neither swords nor light sabers clash; all the significant actions of the narrative are merely reported, described in interminable recitativos chiefly by the aged Gurnemanz, a knight of the Grail who must, surely must! have done a worthy deed or two in the misty past but whose role in the present seems to be to substitute for the Chorus in an ancient Greek tragedy. The story of Parsifal, here in Wagner's libretto, is no less mock-portentous and no more profound that Tolkein's also interminable ""Lord of the Rings"". Both Wagner and Tolkien, of course, were mining the lode of medieval Germanic poetry, explicitly in Wagner's case the 13th C epic ""Parzifal"" by Wolfram von Eschenbach. ""Action"" isn't easy to convey on the opera stage, not without interrupting the music, and many of my favorite 18th or 20th C operas show as little physical drama on stage as Parsifal. But Wagner immobilizes his characters, including his doughty heroes, to such a degree that they might as well stand and sing oratorio-fashion rather than stagger and toddle like over-fed zombies with no more appetite for brains.

This production is particularly devoted to staggering and toddling arbitrarily. What possible dramatic intention is expressed, for instance, in the querulous lurching of the throng of Grail knights around the direly wounded and grieving King Amfortas? Does Parsifal have an ague or a palsy, which cause him to stumble and writhe even in his moments of apparent triumph and epiphany? Is it supposed to represent spiritual agony? It's all so awkward and graceless! Watching this Parsifal, acted and sung by Christopher Ventris, is disconcerting, almost disgusting. Parsifal is supposed to be a young innocent, a virgin, a ""fool"" because of his upbringing apart from wicked humankind. There's no freshness of youth about Ventris's Parsifal; he's more a lout than a fool, and he gapes at every turn of events with idiotic skepticism rather than naivete. Camera close-ups reveal Ventris to be older and coarser than the drama insists Parsifal should be. That's the liability of filming opera in general. Costume, make-up, and stage blocking could and should 'adjust' our perceptions, but stage director Nikolaus Lehnhoff seems to have striven to cast his poor tenor Ventris as a half-gorped dullard.

Lehnhoff's whole production, to be blunt, is flat-out drab and ugly, as if he'd set out to make a five-hour opera seem twice as long. The set is an abandoned concrete bunker of World War I or II vintage. The knights of the Grail dodder around in baggy grey bathrobes and puttee bandages, all made of what looks like recycled duct tape. It's grey on grey throughout the first and third acts, except for momentary incongruities. The semi-mummified old king, Titurel, rises from his tomb in a costume of glittering green scales, looking like a frog-monster in a colorized Hollywood horror flick. Act 2 reveals the evil wizard Klingsor as a kind of bloated tropical spider at the center of a gauzy web of lights. Klingsor blusters magniloquently, but his powers are feeble; the lunge he takes at Parsifal with the Holy Lance is anticlimactic, and he falls on the ground like a popped balloon. The eternal temptress Kundry goes through a series of costumes from scabrously feathered wild woman in Act 1 to an amorous hag erupting from a giant tomatillo in Act 2 to a burn-victim-bandaged nun in Act 3, an act in which she's identified by allusion with Mary Magdalene. ""We"" never really learn who or what she is, in this production, but she walks off arm and arm with Parsifal at the final curtain. The libretto makes no bones about identifying Parsifal as a ""Redeemer"" -- a new Christ is he? whose feet are washed and whose head is anointed -- but I for one can't imagine what Wagner really had in mind with his Kundry, particularly since it was already established in Act 2 that 'dalliance' with her was the real source of Amfortas's incurable spiritual wound. Whatever incoherence and ambiguity Richard Wagner wanted to express in his libretto and music, director Nikolaus Lehnhof has amplified and perhaps intentionally caricatured in this dismal staging.

It would be discreet of me to blame my on-star rating of this DVD entirely on the dreadful production, and to say something like ""but the singing was magnificent and the orchestra sublime."" I guess it's not in my nature to be that discreet. The singing was adequate; the superb Matti Salminen had by far the longest role, as Gurnemanz, but his voice isn't what it once was and the role involves more narrative back-fill than musical affect. Parsifal has perhaps three or four passages of musical beauty to sing, moments when Ventris's heroic timbres could be heard. Baritone Thomas Hampson couldn't make the threnodies of King Amfortas musically glorious; nobody could. His acting, however, was out of keeping with the rest of the cast; he over-writhed his agony, given that everybody else on stage was posing in catatonic indecision.

I enjoyed watching conductor Kent Nagano. If any of the singers in this staging had acted their roles with the intensity and fervor we see in Nagano's face as he conducts the overtures, the whole production would have been less turgid. Nagano is a conductor whose aesthetics have been deeply influenced by ""historically informed"" Early Music, and that influence is obvious in the retrained clarity of his interpretations.

And now, the music per se? The ""raison d'etre"" of any Wagner staging? Frankly, there's less to it than meets the ear. There are passages of vivid orchestration in Parsifal, but there are far more passages of mere portentous rumbling. It's a lot of static meandering -- how's that for an oxymoron? -- occasionally lightened by a clarion call of corny pomposity. There's just about enough musical material in the whole opera for a decent overture. Wagner is generally credited with unifying the vocal and instrumental components of opera, decisively abolishing the distinctions between recitativo and aria, integrating the sung language with the instrumental language of the orchestra. Of course, Rameau and other French Baroque composers had already achieved such integration. For a listener familiar with Italian Baroque opera, it must seem that Wagner's vocal writing is ALL recitativo, accompanied arioso at best, with only the arias banished. ""Parsifal"" is unquestionably Wagner's least stirring vocal/choral symphony; listening to it in concert would surely convince one of a need for redemption.",1326758400,4,6712,5.076086956521739

An original and well thought out point of view - even if it doesn't exactly follow Wagner's stage directions! For those dissenting about the production, I remember reading about a comment a woman made to Wolfgang Wagner after the first performance of the 1976 Ring. The comment was ""I hate everything about the production but your grandfather would approve"". Wagner recognized - and encouraged - revisionism of his operas. The last thing he wanted was for them to remain static, even if the results were a little wayward.

To me the big weakness of this set is Christopher Ventris's Parsifal. OK in Acts 1 and 2 but in Act three, which he should dominate, he utterly fails to. Listen to Jess  Thomas for Knappertsbusch to see what I mean. I have also seen Thomas live in the role and for me it was a profound experience. His cry of ""Amfortas"" in feeling his pain was shattering.

I was a supernumerary in Lyric's misguided production of Lohengrin years earlier and stood for an hour hold a spear in the entire first act.  For this Parsifal I kept wondering why it was staged at a highway underpass.  Were the characters bums looking for a handout?  When Kundry stumbled on stage I thought she looked like a character from Cats who had lost her way.  Or was she Papagena?  I've forgiven a lot on stage but this was so annoying I couldn't ignore it.

How would you feel if, on going into the museum, instead of seeing the old, boring, conservative paintings by Van Gogh and El Greco, the museum were instead to serve up for you a multi-media mash up?  If anyone actually wants to see a Van Gogh painting, just pat the ingenue on the head and advise them that they are seeing the 'real' spirit of Van Gogh in the mashup, because surely Van Gogh would never use oil paints today, or paint pictures of old chairs and fields.

At issue here is the word 'interpretation'.  The author has left behind musical direction, which has been followed, albeit as an 'interpretation'.  The author has left behind stage direction, which has been ignored, or cast so far from the author's written direction that we can reasonably debate whether it is an interpretation, or an orthogonal deviation.

I'll grant the reader that conventions have changed, history has changed us, but that doesn't mean Van Gogh is no longer relevant to a great many people.  What the director should remember is that the audience has a role as its own interpreter.  The director brings the old work to life, living anew before our eyes, a miracle, and we, in the rush of our modern lives, can stop for a moment in Wagner's dusky thoughts, breathing anew for our considerations, and value our own interpretations, for our own lives, and for our own times.  Sometimes the plain, apparent distance in time, from the old conventions to the new, helps an audience to create their own intellectual abstractions.

And if someone wants to make a new opera, by all means, please, go right ahead.  I could imagine this director enjoying Kraftwerk/Phillip Glass compositions and a plot similar to the Matrix.  Have at it.

There have been numerous cases over time where musical direction has sheepishly force-fit convincing artistic expressions to fit modern styles.  Naturally, this is sold to the public as bold evolution.  Generally, riding the reputation of the older work, new fans can be brought in on the basis of the new style, but the artistry as a whole suffers, since the work has been fundamentally altered not out of some inherent need, but the tastes of convention.

This is a subjective area, so everyone's going to have their own valid opinion, but my opinion is that while new representations certainly win my curiosity, and I'm happy to see people facing challenges, there is a responsibility to convey the original work of art as 'conceived', and to be honest with ourselves that this is actually being done.",1311206400,9,2802,4.818371607515657

8053137,3,B0007X9T70,"I dislike the trend nowadays of companies like Opus Arte releasing films of every new production by every new wunderkind set designer, producer and director that happens to sprout up out of Euro-elitism.  Nikolaus Lehnhoff is hardly a sprout, though he looks amazingly youthful, even suspiciously so, at 65.  He is in fact the anointed monarch of current regie-theatre practices that have spread like a virus all over the world.  There has always been a modernist branch of Wagnerian production going back to Adolphe Appia in the early 20th century.  Wieland Wagner took up this more abstract mantel in the 1950s and mid-wifed the pale and measly new-born regie beast of self-expression which, currently and hopefully temporarily, has inundated the opera-going public with expensive, adolescent brainfarts of enfant-terrible wannabees.

Years ago I recall a beautiful Frau ohne Schatten in San Francisco, a Wieland Wagner based production overseen by a young Lehnhoff.  The next thing I knew of him he had produced a silly, politically trendy Ring cycle in Munich, preserved on audio cds (mercifully) in a fine performance from Wolfgang Sawallisch, Hildegard Behrens, Ren Kollo and Robert Hale.  A must-have Ring cycle for Wagnerians.  Since then I have purchased Lehnhoff's Lohengrin, also from Baden-Baden with Kent Nagano in the pit.

I bought this Parsifal, like Lohengrin, because of Kent Nagano, the great orchestra and the casts.  The Lohengrin sets were much like the Parsifal sets, though in Lohengrin the monumental unit set was discarded for the Bridal Chamber scene so there was some relief from the grey oppression that dominated Lehnhoff's stage.

There is no relief in his Parsifal. It is the same curving-cement hideousness throughout.  Things like kitchen chairs and corpses appear and disappear from this wall that comes at the audience like a wave of malice.  It's awful.  To top off the nonsense of Lehnhoff's vision there is a large pointy rock which has, one must suppose, crashed through the wall and is lodged there permanently like a visual brain tumor.  This rock goes away eventually.  Things and characters come and go through the various doors and trapdoors that appear and disappear when needed.  So it's a very functional set, but that's about it as far as positive aspects of Raimund Bauer's designs go.  Lehnhoff directs, micro-manages, the chorus and actors to move in a mechanical, ritualistic manner.  He presents the chorus of knights as automatons, ho-hum.  This production is entirely anti-Christian.  I am not offended by this as I am no fan of any religious dogmas that turn sane people into ignorant fanatics, but Parsifal is a deeply Christian story so Lehnhoff's 'take' on the story is completely irrelevant.  He has twisted the allegorical aspect and neutered the text.  He has had to wedge the characters into his Konzept which is always risky because the original text can never be entirely fitted into a cogent interpretation of this extremity, the result is boring and mediocre, like a committee dreamed it up.  What really irks is that Lehnhoff has changed Wagner's ending and has Parsifal dump the now-dead Amfortas's crown on the decaying skull of Titurel, then
follows Kundry down a miner's railway into the tunnel.  God, not another tunnel.

The costumes by another genius named Andrea Schmidt-Futterer are slightly more successful but still a muddle.
The knights and all personnel of tes bullet-riddled bunker (the Grail's castle) are uniformly drab to the point of depression. All are dressed in grey and buff burlap.  Only Kundry and Parsifal brighten the scene with their moth-eaten feathers.  Kundry in Act I resembles nothing more than that love-sick Warner Brothers chicken, Clarabelle or something like that.  Her costume is ridiculous as is her avian headwear.  After Kundry arrives with the balsam from Arabia I began to see that rock in the wall in a different light.  It suddenly resembled a chicken's peak poking through a rip in the hutch wall.  Parsifal is the dead spit for Hiawatha with Rastafarian dreadlocks.  He is about 25 lbs too heavy for this costume with a cuddly spare tire drooping over his feathered belt.

Act II's costumes are more successful and reduce the impact of the sets which recede nicely into the background when the flowermaidens take center stage and later when Kundry pops up in her Evil Genius (Time Bandits) costume.  All this seductress (?) costume lacks are the arrow-shafts sticking out of it just prior to popping them out and piercing the hearts of the bowman who shot them in the first place.  There are other risible aspects in this show.  But Kundry finally wriggles her way out of the cocoon-like pod she inhabits and finishes Act II in a bell-like skirt reminiscent of Ruth Berghaus's Rhine maidens in her famous production from Hamburg, which wasn't filmed which is a great loss to the opera world.  The late Berghaus was avant-garde but truly a brilliant opera producer, she has no successors at the moment.

The flower maidens are dressed blandly with long trumpeted sleeves hiding their hands.  At the end of their very well choreographed scene long poisonous-looking stingers stick out from their sleeves, it is very effective.  And Duane Schuler's excellent lighting adds a dangerous shimmer (red), making these flowers really deadly.  The makeup, by the way, is superb.  From Klingsor's Kabuki-like mask to the black lipstick on the flowers, it is all very compelling visually, as far as that goes.  Unfortunately the costumer got a little mixed up with Klingsor.  Upon closer observation he begins to look a bit like a demonic Teletubby dressed up like a suicide bomber.  But Fox sings convincingly, though I've always wondered why Wagner would cast a virile baritone voice as a castrated wizard.  A Mime-like tenor might have been more convincing and even more sinister sounding. But who am I to question Wagner's artistic choices.

Nikoaus Lehnhoff is nowhere near originality in any of his shows that I've seen.  But he clearly thinks a great deal of himself as indicated by the supercilious, egg-headed lecture he gives in the special feature called Parsifal's Progress.
In this little film we get interviews, and good ones, from the leading singers.  Tom Fox (Klingsor) and Christopher Ventris (Parsifal) are especially insightful.  All the singers are clearly motivated by Wagner's original intentions whereas Lehnhoff and the costume designer, whatsername, are all bedazzled by their own cleverness.  I got the feeling that the cast wasn't as enamored of the set-designs and Konzept as were the designer und Konzeptualist.

When Lehnhoff speaks I am reminded B. Cliban's cartoon entitled 'Intellectual' which shows a goateed, bald-headed, bespectacled professor naked on his hands and knees.  He is wearing a dunce cap connected to his rectum by a long hose.

Christopher Ventris (Parsifal) and Waltraud Meier (Kundry) are both good-looking people and can act, she is in fact a tremendous actress and could do well, I expect, in the legitimate theater, if she were to go the same path as the great Martha Mdl, who acted on the stage after stopping her singing career.  She died with her acting boots on.  Meier throws herself fully in to the proceedings.  Her acting is disturbing and intense and she almost makes some sense of Lehnhoff's vision but somehow one senses that his vision is brittle and flimsy.  Which it is.  Meier is still a fabulous Kundry in this show but she has to work very hard to distract from her costumes and headgear.  Her voice, as recorded, sounds pretty full-throated though she always has that restricted, slightly tubular aspect to the sound.  She is more successful in Lehnhoff's production of Lohengrin where she sweeps all before her as Ortrud.

Matti Salminen (Gurnemanz) sings beautifully but cannot make much of an effect in such a washed-out, nihilistic production.  Bjarni Thor Kristinsson (what a great name for a Wagnerian bass!!) sounds suitably sepulchral, and a tad wobbly as Titurel.  But Mr Kristinsson has much to endure in this production, sitting in a hole in the floor, having to sing through a skeleton-faced Halloween mask, sealed up in a scraggy looking overcoat of golden scales.  He reminds me of a cartoon alligator.  Which also reminds me to mention that the only elements of nature you will see in this production come in the form of the characters themselves.  Kundry, reptilian (avian), Klingsor, also reptilian and the Flower Maidens, poisonous asphodels.  Don't look for trees or flowers or blue sky or sunshine, this Montsalvat is all cement and iron.

Thomas Hampson is his usual hammy self, acting like Jesus on the Cross and rolling his agonized eyes and toothily staring into space, gape-mouthed.  He also has what appears to be very rotten tooth (cigarettes?).  Perhaps he fears dental surgery.  This at least dispels his Mr Dentine aura, but the vanity still shines through and makes his Amfortas, like just about every character he sings, a bit of a rum chap.  And Hampson really doesn't have the voice for Wagner, though he uses his instrument intelligently to cover up the chinks in his Wagnerian armor.

Kent Nagano is a fine conductor of late 19th century German romanticism.  I've heard some truly beautiful Mahler from his baton and his Wagner is notable, more interesting than Donald Runnicles, who conducted this production, which I saw in San Francisco.  I prefer Nagano's forward-momentum to Levine's static wallow.  If you like the Levine/Schenk production from the Met, you'll hate this Lehnhoff show from Baden-Baden.  And Levine has the marginally finer cast, with Meier in a younger, better-sung incarnation of Kundry.

Having watched Baden-Baden Parsifal again recently I have decided I will keep it (I am in a thinning phase in my record collection).  The quandary of this Opus Arte release is that the musical values are very high indeed but the production comes just this side of making it a complete waste of time, talent and money.

So, who would want this Parsifal?  Waltraud Meier completists, Kent Nagano believers, lovers of beautifully performed masterworks (musically speaking) and the open-minded who are not ashamed of being duped from time to time in order to get a small fix of some kind.  In this case, I think I am convinced to a small degree by Act II and Waltraud Meier's compelling Kundry.  But I still await a great filmed Parsifal.  The Bayreuth/Wolfgang Wagner production from 1981 is probably the best overall recommendation at this point.  The cast is very strong, Stein was a very fine Wagnerian and Wagner's production is lovely to behold at times if not brilliant.",1288224000,6,10700,5.061679040548258

This is the secret behind this product, which I feel safe to recommend. Great singers, nice staging, a very good picture and impeccable stereo or Dolby sound. Though, I have to say I was disapointed on one point of Lehnhoffs direction: He has chosen to rewrite the end in light of his (lack of?) religous conviction.",1190246400,4,441,4.45679012345679
