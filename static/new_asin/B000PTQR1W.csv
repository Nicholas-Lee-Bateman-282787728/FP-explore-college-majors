8193293,3,B000PTQR1W,"The 4th & 5th stars were omitted not because of Thomas Keller but because of the interviewer.  She tends to interrupt and not let the chefs go off on their own tangent which is what we, as fans, want to see.
She is too adoring, not necessary nor professional.  I really doubt whether chefs at this level need her fawning.
The cooking section seems obligatory rather than useful.  Again, not chef's fault.  Not enough time provided.
When chef does speak, he is a great pleasure to listen to.  He is full of passion, knowledge and caring about his craft and the next generation of chefs.  He is inspiring.  DVD is excellent quality.  The shipping company shipped the wrong DVD first time.  After contacting them, they realized it would cost too much for me to return just one all the way from Asia so offered to ship the right one for no extra charge and it came quickly. Excellent service.",1357257600,2,888,4.534591194968553
