2872558,5,B000ROA00Y,"All of these ""America's Game"" series are absolutely spectacular.  I've purchased several sets (Giants, 49ers, Cowboys, etc) and every single one has been simply outstanding.  NFL Network does a great job with all their stuff, but this series definitely tops the cake!
Gotta love Johnny Elway!!",1325289600,2,293,5.3478260869565215

2872560,5,B000ROA00Y,"As a die hard Broncos fan who grew up while John Elway was leading the team, this video brought back tons of wonderful memories.  I had forgotten how good the team really was back then and how every week we had a chance to win the game.  If you followed the Broncos at all during the Elway era, this is a video for you.",1298764800,5,319,3.96875
2872561,5,B000ROA00Y,Each DVD is about Denver Broncos in their years of Superbowl championship.  What makes the DVD great is that the inside stories of what had happened along the way and what shaped them to finally be the Superbowl champion were told by 3 key players.  These 2 DVDs are better than the NFL Superbowl collections since those DVDs tried to present what happened around the NFL in one year in only 45 minutes which was too much stuffs in too little time.,1298160000,6,448,4.451219512195122

2872563,2,B000ROA00Y,"This contains two fantastic documentaries that profile the two best teams in Denver Broncos history.  The content is great and the production is top notch.

That said, considering that you can purchase these through video download services for $2 for each season ($4 total) makes this quite a bit overpriced.  It's interesting that these two programs cost more at Amazon.com than the 3 greatest games set for the Denver Broncos.

Great product, poor price.",1218412800,4,456,5.121621621621622
