8357192,4,B0028YW3E2,"The whole film centers around the main character Han Bing and her struggle to become a famous singer. None of the actors, as far as I know, are famous, but they all do a good job portraying their characters. Especially the actor who plays Han Bing's uncle stands out as a really good actor. The story is fairly predictable and kind of cliche but at the same time very charming with some nice twists towards the end.",1263772800,,415,4.402597402597403
8357193,1,B0028YW3E2,This is one of the worst movie I ever watched. Bad acting and bad art direction. Avoid it at all cost. Does Amazon even offer a zero star rating option?,1257552000,,152,4.1
