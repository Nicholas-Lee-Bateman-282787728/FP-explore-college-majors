6667283,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"This is my first review . . .  ever . . .  of all time.  So, that should let you know something right off the bat.

If you found your way here on purpose, you already know you want it - so get it.

If you found your way here on accident and don't really know what you're looking at - go to roosterteeth 's website and watch some of RvB (every episode is available to stream there), each season has a bunch of episodes and their seasons are grouped into series.  Seasons 1-5 are a series, then 6-8, then 9-10, season 11 and 12 are part of another series which will conclude with season 13.  You can start each series without needing a whole lot of backstory - but the backstory is awesome, so while the beginning of any particular season might be a logical start-off point to check them out, I still recommend starting from the beginning.  Then come back here and buy their DVDs to support the artists so they keep making more!",1413504000,12,926,4.221590909090909
6667284,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"Okay, let me start that I am a huge fan of RVB, it's the best webseries ever, but why would you get the dvd when it's available online for free? Cause the show is a standard and many machinima artists owe RoosterTeeth for making the best machinima ever, and getting it on DVD helps RT out, and in return we get Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, bonus videos, and some minor updates that weren't implemented into the show when it was on there website. The show kicks ass and it is worth every penny.",1412985600,12,490,4.336956521739131
6667285,5,B00NLZAAAQ,One of the best online Web series I have ever seen! Keep up the good work rooster teeth!,1412812800,,88,3.9444444444444446

6667290,5,B00NLZAAAQ,The pacing and depth of the story have grown every season.  I had to re-watch it twice to catch some of the throwbacks but other than that this was a blast! Bring us the next season as soon as possible.,1457481600,,202,4.05
6667291,3,B00NLZAAAQ,"Love the show hate that Amazon video doesn't have season 13 for free, had netflix and they had season 13 didn't have to pay extra but it you get what you pay for,  5 stars for red vs. Blue, 1 star for Amazon video",1457308800,,213,3.840909090909091
6667292,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"Purchased as a collectible as the recipient has every other season and watches religiously.  If you're into the Halo franchise, than I highly recommend.  Rooster Teeth knows what they're doing and are a pleasure to watch.",1457136000,,221,5.111111111111111

6667295,5,B00NLZAAAQ,What more do you want me to say?,1455580800,,32,3.125
6667296,3,B00NLZAAAQ,"Long gone are the glory days of the show. The animators and the writers are dedicated to telling an actual story with drama, lined with occasional humor, but it has fallen a long ways since the first five seasons.

The humor is still top notch, but a lot of the dramatic storytelling, along with the more ""serious"" characters and dialog, comes off as very cringey. The animation skills are out of this world, but to see ""UBER SWEET"" battles is something I never actually wanted out of Red Vs Blue. I actually loved the setting for this new conflict the ole gang has fallen into, along with the new recruits, and am more glad than anything else that they are all finally back together (rather than spread apart with varying side-stories as they were Seasons 6-9).

Still funny, but 2 stars are docked for a convoluted, and overly self-serious, story. If it was just a bunch of space marines wasting each other's time, it'd be amazing, but forcing a ho-hum drama to go with the humor really took a toll on me.",1454544000,,1007,4.527472527472527
6667297,1,B00NLZAAAQ,Boring low quality animation with foul language. Sponge Bob is actually more entertaining.,1454544000,,90,6.0

6667301,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"The continuing saga of Blood Gulch has a great and captivating story line. Rooster Teeth has continued to excell in their high quality work.

The season will hold up alone, but I recommend watching from season 1 rather than watching 12 first and then going back.  Mainly due to the increased resolution of the source video game (HALO).",1453939200,,335,4.758620689655173

6667303,5,B00NLZAAAQ,I'm still blown away by each new episode. I always tell myself there's no way that this one could be better than the last one. And they continue to prove me wrong.,1453507200,,163,4.125

6667311,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"I was a little worried about the story with Miles writing it, and you can tell some of the differences in style, but it might be just that it's a different look. I don't know, but honestly don't really care. It's an awesome season, and a cool build up to the next season; Keep it up guys.",1444953600,,288,4.0701754385964914

6667320,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"I haven't seen the first 11 of these but I was really surprised at the quality of this work.

If you are looking for a hour or two of a well written story with action, comedy and drama then don't look any further. I am actually looking forward to volume 13.

The creators definitely touch on the universe of the Halo franchise but this is totally a spin off and it feels like a really good breath of fresh air.",1442361600,,410,4.1125

6667330,4,B00NLZAAAQ,"They really increases the aspect and plot since season 11. The CGI is bearable and it has an amazing story. However, there's not much humorous parts like the older ones, but it's still enjoyable! It really changed since the first season and the show is like half CG now, with little humor. The enemy Locus is a bit annoying at times, but it's still good to add to your collection!",1440979200,,380,4.442857142857143

6667334,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"This is perhaps the best season of RvB yet, and even that is debatable, since the past set of seasons have been absolutely incredible as well. Either way, they managed to raise the series to new heights with improved animation, a much larger cast, genius tactics and jokes, and a progressively interesting & engaging story which continues to tie in perfectly to the events in the past and build up on the RvB lore. I am so excited to see where it can go from here.",1438560000,,464,4.406976744186046

6667411,5,B00NLZAAAQ,Loved the season 12 of this show.  They've completed the new arc of the new direction for their show after completing the long story from their first 10 seasons.  I'm glad that you can watch this new arc even without knowledge of the previous seasons and still laugh and have fun with it.  Worthy of the price.,1424476800,,310,4.4035087719298245

6667413,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"Another amazing Red vs. Blue season. This season ends on a badass note. The only downfall of this: waiting for season 13 just got even harder.

I wish seasons 11 and 12 were prime eligible, but I assure you they will not disappoint. If you're a true fan on the fence about buying seasons 11 and 12 or waiting for them to go on prime, my recommendation is to bite the bullet and pay. It is well worth it.

Side note: RvB Season 13 set to come out in the Spring around March.",1423785600,2,473,4.075268817204301
6667414,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"As a long time RVB fan, I can say that this season was spectacular. In season 11, they stopped their ""free movement animation"" for some reason. Perhaps it was a money issue. Any way the action in season 12 was great. In addition to carrying on the story they expertly tied the new arch with the old one. Rooster teeths story telling has always been spot on and season 12 is no exception. If you are a true RVB fan, then season 12 is a must get. If you have yet to enjoy the RVB series, be sure to start with season one.",1423612800,4,519,4.048543689320389

6667417,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"It's Red vs Blue, so what is to say (No spoilers here).  This is the sequel to Season 11, where we find the the troops where we left them.  Personally, I like this one a lot more than season 11, which seemed a bit slow and lacking in humor, which is understandable considering they had to reorient the series.  This one, the comedy and jackassery is back in full force.  In lieu of an actual review, I'll leave you with some teasers to help you make up your mind.  If you are new to the Red v Blue series, avoid this one and go to Season 1 (if you have Prime, Seasons 1 through 10 are free).

1. Tucker, Grif, Caboose, and Simmons are promoted to Captains (yes, that means Grif outranks Sarge),
2. Grif faces off against Carolina,
3. Caboose is leading a squad, has a good idea and gives a motivational speech,
4. Tucker teaches abstinence in regards to a certain type of female,
5. Simmons has to talk to girls, including a hot volleyball player,
6. We see signs of Donut's heterosexuality (just kidding!), &
7. We learn what happens to Freckles.",1423353600,5,1047,4.343589743589743

The same script that made the series what it is today has only become more story filled and character rich. I can't wait what is to become of this great show, all I hope is that they don't loose their way",1422662400,,347,4.043478260869565
6667424,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"Red VS Blue continues it's high-quality workmanship with this latest installment in the lore.  The plot, music, and animations have increased dramatically with each season passing.  First-time fans will enjoy this series; and I strongly urge any new-comer to revisit the previous seasons to fully appreciate the evolution of this series.

This season is more appropriate for young adults, and I would advise away from children and early teens as there are snippets of adult humor and bucket loads of crude language.  This is a must-watch series for all Gamers; i guarantee you will enjoy if you give it a chance.",1422230400,5,612,5.02970297029703

6667433,5,B00NLZAAAQ,"Well here I am with my first review. I've seen most of this season tho its not the best it's definitely paving the base for something ridiculously epic and am certainly looking forward to seeing where RT takes this. Little back story,  I first saw this crazy show years back and it was just some goofy cartoon play in the background at a party. Few years later the story and production value grew in favor of the series. And just seems to continue to grow. I still remember my first viewing of season 1 and love that it's still going, furthermore that it's still growing in popularity. So jump on the bandwagon and experience something different.  You'll be glad you did. :)",1414454400,3,674,4.516393442622951
