4001584,5,B002VRNJFI,"Emma Lloyd has made a career out of her sensible, mature and responsible approach to relationships. She has a hit radio talk show, an impending book deal, and a loving relationship with her fianc, Richard, a conventional sort-which is precisely what Emma is drawn to. Then Emma finds out that she is already married to a man she's never met before, a result of a misguided prank that leaves her bewildered and very confused. Worse than that, her plans for the future are now threatened. With her wedding just around the corner, Emma must find the mystery man and obtain an annulment. Emma tracks down her accidental husband Patrick, a charming and handsome neighborhood fireman, with a big secret that he was behind the accidental marriage. Unable to fess up, Patrick goes along with the ruse pretending to be just as baffled as Emma. While at first their opposite approaches to life create much tension and chaos, Emma soon starts to admire his carefree passion for life and doubt her own conservative, button-down views on life and love. As Emma's wedding draws near, she is faced with the choice between her safe life with Richard or the chance to live in the passionate and spontaneous world that Patrick inhabits. The story is very well written with lots of twists and turns and the comic timing was just right. Most movies seem to have a bit of a slow section where you wish they would just get on with it but this movie keeps you interested all the way through.",1268697600,,1468,4.671814671814672
4001585,5,B002VRNJFI,"I loved this movie.  The Norman Rockwell/""Leave it to Beaver"" view of motherhood never worked for me.  Life is a wonderful, funny, heartbreaking juggling act...and I think this film ""gets it.""  As I've raised my brood in a rural community, I was amused and fascinated by the film's take on raising kids in the city.  Overall...the film fascinated me...amused me...touched me. It was one of the better films I've seen recently.  It's smart, and the humor comes out of irony.",1268611200,10,473,4.8625
4001586,2,B002VRNJFI,"I am giving this movie two stars only because I like Anthony Edwards and he did a good job with his role. But I have to agree that this movie was very shallow and might even go so far as to say it was insulting to stay at home moms. I work full time (not by choice but necessity) and have raised 3 children and I know how hard it is to be a parent, but to act as if this woman's day is so stressful because she has to prepare for her daughter's birthday party while doing all of her day to day ""duties"" which includes taking her older child to school (if you could even call it that since all she has to do is walk her down the stairs to the sidewalk because the school is close enough to where they run to the window at recess time and wave to her ), taking her younger son to the park, walking her dog and shopping with her girlfriend. And in between all of that she types a couple of sentences in a blog that she does for fun. She is so ""overworked"" she has to have her husband take time off from his job to watch the youngest kid so that she can hop on her bike (even though they do own a car) and run to the store for party supplies AND run to the bakery to pick up the cake. If only all of our lives were that stressful. It was more annoying then funny so unless you are complety board and have nothing better to do and no other movie is available I would say skip this one",1267660800,2,1379,3.859154929577465
4001587,4,B002VRNJFI,"This is probably a really good movie that lots of people will truly enjoy.  I can say that this little story about a day in the life of this family, and especially the mother, does have a certain charm to it.  And the acting is very well done.

  But here is the thing that really turned me off:  This day is very hectic.  My, my.  All the things the mother has to do in this day.  What a busy, almost intolerable day.  My. my.  Of course, most of us have to do all that stuff, and still go to work.  We get up at 4:30 every morning, do EVERYTHING this mother has to do, put in 8 serious hours, commute, trust our children to daycare, come home, clean, cook, shop, be cheerful....

  Some people think that is a choice.  But for most of us, it isn't.  It is just the reality of needing a paycheck.  So, this movie just didn't click with me.  I felt like I was watching Marie Antoinette say, ""Let them eat cake.""

  I don't think I've ever been so sarcastic in a review, but this movie was just very, very, very shallow.",1267056000,8,1019,4.091836734693878
4001588,2,B002VRNJFI,"Motherhood is a good movie, but it doesn't offer the kind of outrageous laughs needed to make it truly funny.

While I think stay-at-home moms (and some dads) will be able to relate, it is simply too close to home to be laugh-out-loud funny. Films like this need to take the ordinary chuckles and stresses of life and make them outrageous - so much so that audiences will laugh constantly.

Motherhood doesn't do that.

If you need to vent about parenthood and your friends aren't available, rent this movie and it will likely make you feel better. If you are looking for laughs, look elsewhere.",1266969600,,595,4.647619047619048
4001589,5,B002VRNJFI,"This movie is funny, insightful and moving -- a pretty rare combination these days.  Uma Thurman has never been better, Minnie Driver is delightful and Anthony Edwards is rock solid; the child actors are also excellent and cameos by Samantha B and Jodie Foster are icing on an already tasty cake.  Dialogue is snappy, New York locations evocative.  I loved the film!!",1265846400,3,367,4.887096774193548
4001590,1,B002VRNJFI,"Don't be fooled by that 5-star review.  This could have been extremely funny, but it was not at all.  I am a mother and think my day-to-day life can be humorous at times, but the humor is way too contrived and the actors are trying too hard to be funny.  The whole thing made me cringe.  My husband went to bed after 10 minutes, I should have gone with him.",1265414400,17,357,4.057142857142857
4001591,5,B002VRNJFI,"Greenwhich Village, NY (specifically the west village) provides the backdrop for this totally fun romantic comedy about a mom who has to plan out one crazy, yet typical mom-day that in this instance includes tonight's 6 year b-day party, but also includes protecting her car, saving her bike, getting the right goodie-bags, befriending her friend (Minnie Driver)and of course writing her blog about being a mom. Whew....

Uma Thurman, in a role so entirely different than anything she's done before, plays 'mom' and is fantastic! Her relationship with her husband (Anthony Edwards) seem quite real-life in that he wants to be of help but hey... he is a man, right? There IS a bit of magic between them indeed and while it might not be on the scale of ""Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan"" (yet), it peeks through nonetheless and proves itself by the end of the film in a scene sure to win you over entirely. I could envision the two together in more films going forward...

Minnie Driver plays the perfect supporting role as 'insightful best friend' and while the movie runs along a somewhat predictable course at times, it also provides some very nice surprises and follows that formula that always wins while laying in some interesting insights into what it's like to be a mom. I can see the mommy-blogs launching new discussions for sure and a plethora of subjects. OK OK... I realize that I am not a mom, but I am married to one...

If you enjoy films like Moonstruck, Sleepless in Seattle, Mask, You've Got Mail and so on, Motherhood is a likely winner for you.",1258502400,20,1553,4.681318681318682
4001592,3,B002VRNJFI,"It started out to be a nice comedy about motherhood and I have 6 grandchildren so I expected it to be a totally clean movie. Watching it with my 2 youngest granddaughters ages 11 and 8, I was shocked to say the least when one of the main characters' friends referred to an incident of masturbating in her tub with her son's battery operated tub toy. Thank God they didn't ask me any questions. I was mortified. Can't Hollywood produce a decent family comedy without some veiled reference to the sex act?
Otherwise, they did a good job of showing her mounting frustration as she tried to carry out her motherly and business duties in a timely fashion while still being efficient at both but come on people. Some things about single parents don't need to be discussed on the big screen. It's private.",1291075200,2,798,4.548611111111111
4001593,1,B002VRNJFI,"I don't typically write reviews, but I do read them before I buy something. This movie was $7 for a Blu Ray, and having kids myself, thought it would be fun to watch the mom running around trying to get things done. The movie got decent reviews and I bought it.

We had movie night with my parents, who are addicted to watching movies, as well as my husband and I are. My parents went back home after 20 minutes as they couldn't take it anymore. We watched the rest, but it was painful.

What we thought would be a fast-paced fun movie to watch, ended up being a slow and depressing movie. This family lives in a small apartment in New York, where there have to take stairs up and down several times a day. They have a very old car and a bicycle to run their errands. The husband seems like a jerk the entire movie (which ends up not being the case). The mom doesn't really run around all day, but what we see is her struggling through the day going shopping for her daughter's 6th birthday party on her bicycle and coming back exhausted from it. The movie shows how difficult it is for that particular family to handle daily tasks and the complications of adding extra things to the ""to-do-list"", such as having to move their car constantly because they live in New York city and the fear of losing their parking space. I did not relate to them in any way. We live in the suburbs with a house and a decent car and we have never had to rush out to move our car or do our shopping on a bike. The movie was very slow. I can see how someone living in New York could relate, but anyone else would probably not.

If you think you're going to see a ""comedy"", it's not. The movie makes bad references about all types of mom: the normal mom (Uma Thurman), the crazy organic mom, the single (and pregnant) mom, the rich mom who everything seems perfect and easy, the mom-arrazzy... This is a movie that we will never watch again, even though I love Uma Thurman. Ugh.... it was such a wast of our time.

I even watched the trailer before I purchased the movie. Not what I expected.

I hope this will help someone out there.",1290902400,3,2113,4.233250620347395
4001594,3,B002VRNJFI,"Motherhood is about a Greenwich Village mom Eliza, who is so busy
taking care of her kids, her elderly next-door neighbor and feeling
inadequate about the fact that she hasn't ""made it"" professionally that
she lives a chaotic life and takes terrible care of herself and of
course, for all her devotion to her kids, neglects them also. She can't
take care of her kids' needs if she's not looking after her own. This
is how many women live their lives, but the filmmaker did the film a
disservice by setting it in the Village--it's such a wealthy
neighborhood that it's hard to feel sympathy for this mom. And as for
the scene where she actually invites a strange deliveryman up into her
family's apartment on the day of her daughter's birthday party, no
less, and dances with him is completely unbelievable for a film set in
New York. Even a ditzy person like her would completely distrust
strangers. As some of the other reviewers here have noted, Eliza is an
immensely privileged woman who lives in one of the most affluent
neighborhoods in the world. Her privilege undercuts the important
message of the film, which should be about the under-appreciated and
mostly invisible but enormously time-consuming job it is to raise
children. If this film was made with a truly working-class setting, it would have been more believable. And even though it's supposed to be a comedy, it actually isn't particularly funny.",1290816000,2,1413,4.818930041152264
4001595,2,B002VRNJFI,"As a mommy blogger (although often an AWOL one during this pregnancy and move), I could easily sympathize with the plight of Uma Thurman's character Eliza in Motherhood.  Children to raise, household responsibilities, trying to find some time to write (throw in homeschooling and home business, and yes - it's a full plate.)

However, despite some similarities in our lives I found myself disliking Eliza.  She complains all the time, even though her husband helps with the children and much of her day actually isn't spent with them.  She does come to some sense of contentment with her life, but then is `delivered' from some of her family responsibilities so that she can spend more time writing (while someone else cares for her children.)

Sigh.  Isn't this so reflective of modern motherhood?  Moms who always feel that they need to escape from their little ones in order to pursue their own goals and fulfillment? Don't get me wrong, I too love to write, and time needs to be spent developing our gifts.  We do need to be careful to harmonize this with our job as moms however, and not forever be trying to escape maternal responsibilities (trust me, that strategy just doesn't work!)

Another point against Motherhood is that you can't watch it with your children.  Despite the child-friendly DVD cover and mainly appropriate content there was a scene that completely took me by surprise that includes a very sexual conversation and ongoing references to that conversation.  If you are like me, films that can't be watched in a family setting just don't make it out of the box and into the disc player - the time I have available to watch DVDs is just too limited.

So, unfortunately this mommy blogger was disappointed in a film that held the promise of both laughter and camaraderie.",1285459200,,1793,4.823529411764706
4001596,5,B002VRNJFI,I by passed this at the rental store but I wish now that I had not. Uma Thurman really did an awesome job in this film and every mother could totally relate to this film and if your a blogger mom you'll love it!  I know the critics really got down on this film but they made a mistake it's a gem!,1285027200,,296,3.774193548387097
4001597,5,B002VRNJFI,"Great movie. Period. Many of us mothers could relate to this character, even though many other reviewers didn't think so. I am a stay at home mom in the heart of a big city to kids the same age as those on the movie. Its rough at times, especially when you have no grandparents or anyone to drop the kids off to so you can have some of your life back for an instant. I have had my husband come home to watch kids cause I needed 15 minutes of peace at the store. By the end, her long speech to her husband hit home. We lived similar lives to the movie husband and wife, and it brought things to perspective. Motherhood is a joy and a chore all that the same time. But I, like the main character, wouldn't trade it for anything.",1284076800,,726,4.048611111111111
4001598,2,B002VRNJFI,"This movie kept plodding on and I kept waiting for it to get better. It doesn't!

I think this should be required viewing for high-risk teens as I think it would do a lot to reduce unwanted pregnancies.  As beautiful as Uma Thurmond is, there is nothing attractive about her in this movie.  It showed no joy of motherhood -- at all!  Definitely a downer for marriage and parenthood.

I want my 1.5 hours back!",1283990400,,409,4.4
4001599,5,B002VRNJFI,"It is ONE DAY in the life of a mom, played by Uma Thurman, and it is just an amazing, empowering story, with a fantabulous soundtrack.  It is PG-13, and your children can NOT watch it because of some really choice swear words ;)",1276128000,,228,4.181818181818182

8382497,1,B002VRNJFI,We couldn't finish the movie.  It was a pain to watch it.  Everyone in this movie was not a normal person.,1432512000,,106,4.0
8382498,3,B002VRNJFI,Way to pass time. Bad acting gets a little better towards the end (Uma's). Some interesting soundtrack though.,1406073600,,110,5.166666666666667
8382499,3,B002VRNJFI,"I've seen some Uma Thurman movies, that were funny, enjoyable, and entertaining.  Regretably this wasn't one of them.  I too often see a character I like, an actor I like, a pretense that seems 'cute' and buy the movie.  Jack Black in Nacho Libre, and the video store clerk movie, both bombs in my book, though I like Jack Black.  I should have read the reviews prior to purchase, I probably would not have purchased this film",1371340800,,426,4.4935064935064934
8382500,4,B002VRNJFI,"""Motherhood"" is a great movie for anyone who has a busy life, has or has had children, and understands the chaos this brings.  It has a good storyline, if you have a sense of humor.  It tells with terrific detail the hectic way of life with kids.  It's funny, a tad sad (especially if you are the ""mom"") and a good way to relax for a couple of hours.  Uma makes all the big and little details of day to day life very real.  I loved it and watch it pretty regularly.",1358208000,,465,4.010869565217392
8382501,3,B002VRNJFI,"***1/2

Eliza Welsh is what one of the characters in ""Motherhood"" refers to derisively as an ""urban mom.""  That is to say a young woman who lives in an upscale part of town (in this case, Greenwich Village), has a hoard of New Age-y mom friends who obsess over the ins-and-outs of successful childrearing, and herself hosts a blog dedicated to - what else? - how to survive the rigors of young motherhood without sacrificing one's identity as a woman, as a wife and as an individual.  It's a battle that Eliza seems to be losing at the moment, but at least she's giving it the old college try.

Written and directed by Katherine Dieckmann, this seriocomic tale takes place on the day before Eliza's oldest child is to turn six.  Filled with mixed emotions at the event and saddled with a husband (Anthony Edwards) who seems more focused on his own needs than those of his wife, Eliza struggles with arranging a birthday party, dodging parking tickets, coping with a studio-shoot on her street, looking out for her elderly neighbor, and raising a toddler - all while trying to carve out a little time for herself to write and to do all the things adults (those without children, at least) normally do in the course of their days.

Dieckmann's screenplay is filled with both poignancy and humor as it deftly explores the life of this harried mother.  Uma Thurman, in a tour-de-force performance, captures both the manic energy and utter exhaustion of the nonstop merry-go-round that her character finds herself riding on; and she is fully supported by Edwards as her husband, Minnie Driver as her closest girlfriend, and Arjun Fupta (""Nurse Jackie"") as a sexy delivery boy who, for a brief moment at least, allows Eliza to let her hair down a bit and to see the heart of the vibrant, sexy, carefree woman that still beats beneath all the motherly obsessions and concerns.

Although it's ultimately a bit too slight in the drama department for it to rise much above the level of a bemusing curiosity, ""Motherhood"" still has some valid insights to make about its subject.",1333843200,,2067,4.722222222222222
8382502,5,B002VRNJFI,"This was a very funny movie and well worth the hour and a half or so spent watching it...  A lot of reviewers seem to want perfection as they see it in a movie about a mom making her way through a busy day, but this movie just offers some hilarious fun and good-natured escape.  I'd recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor!",1307750400,,328,4.030769230769231

8382504,4,B002VRNJFI,"I actually thought this movie was very good.  I'm a single mother of one so I have no husband and no support system but I could still identify with this movie.  Uma made you feel her plight.  I frequent a site called Cafemom which has many people like the judgmental women in the stores that Uma's character went to.  They always have something to say about your ways as a mother.  The bottom line is that we do what works for us.  We try daily not to lose our sanity.  And there are many incidents which can make us want to just jump off a bridge but we carry on for our families.  That's our JOBS as a mother. Everyone has their own way of coping and sometimes we just have to do what we have to do to survive.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Sometimes we just feel that we aren't appreciated by our own children.  I felt like Uma when she said ""She got her goodie bags, what does she need me for?""  I totally know this feeling.  Sometimes we get overwhelmed but we continue on.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1301788800,,1017,4.2020725388601035

If you have a child you just gonna watch all routine all over again. If you want to die of boring watching everyday routine made of fictitious problems then go ahead. It is boring and ordinary old style made movie.
Movie doesn't have any emphasizes but Uma's panting carrying either bags or child, or even dog. There is no romantic relationships or jokes you can laugh or drama that would make you cray. I even did not get why movie ended because nothing has not started yet.
Uma is one of most talented actresses but as history shows a lot of actors and actresses were loosing their rating because of poor movie productions. That's what may happen to Uma after this movie. In too words: movie is sucks, don't buy it.",1295395200,,839,4.419354838709677

I have enough drama in my life to be able to sit still and watch another woman and her drama.  I have only watched it once, and it is not really on my favorites list.
