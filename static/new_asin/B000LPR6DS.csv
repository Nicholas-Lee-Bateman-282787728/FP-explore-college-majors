2712102,5,B000LPR6DS,"I've always been a fan of Smallwood since Center Of My Joy.  A choir with so few people sing like they are a hundred deep.  I bought the Persuaded cd and thought that the dvd would be even better. I think this was one of his greatest albums and the dvd was off the chain.  My only beef with the dvd/cd was the fact that Israel and New Breeds Alive is South Africa cd/dvd seemed like it was uncut, everything that was on the dvd was on the cd songwise and i think Smallwood should have done the same thing.  it gives you that feeling of being there. but the dvd was still awesome, Anthem of Praise, Hold on Dont Let Go, My Everything, Psalms 8. The whole dvd is worth buying, trust me...",1277856000,,686,4.097014925373134
2712103,5,B000LPR6DS,"From the beginning praise intro to the ending upbeat gospel-funk number, this is one incredible DVD. We've purchased additional copies to give away to family and friends, if that gives you a clue to how awesome my family thinks it is. I honestly can't pick a true favorite on here because every song was a feast for my ears and spirit, and I've been encouraged greatly in my walk with the Lord. I even bought the CD so I can listen to it in my car. I recommend this to anyone who needs encouragement and loves music; buy it, listen to it, and praise God!",1270339200,,554,4.285714285714286
2712104,5,B000LPR6DS,"What can anyone way about Richard Smallwood?  Is there an adjective for his music?  I don't think so, so I'll just use the tried and true word, AWESOME, POWERFUL, MASTERFUL!

I think Richard Smallwood could sing falalalalala to me and I'd be happy and he could play the scale and I'd jump for joy!  I wish he would just drive up to my door with Visions and just sing for me until I was exhausted.  I am so pleased with my purchase and overjoyed with his music!",1245801600,2,460,4.241379310344827
