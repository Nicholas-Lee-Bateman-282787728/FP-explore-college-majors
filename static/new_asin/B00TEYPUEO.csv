7005843,5,B00TEYPUEO,"This is a wonderful Alec Guinness Ealing Studios film, now made available by Warner Archives. The quirky humor in the Alec Guinness Ealing comedies is present in abundance here - great entertainment! Picture and audio quality are fine, although there are no features or subtitles. Highly recommended.",1434844800,2,300,5.404255319148936
7005844,5,B00TEYPUEO,"Alec Guinness has to be the most versatile actor in screen history not unlike a male Meryl Streep.  Adept at both comedy and drama you barely notice a change in his demeanor when he navigates between the two.  In this film he portrays Captain William Horatio Ambrose, a sailor whose family has a long history in Her Majesty's Navy who gets seasick when he's in close proximity to the ocean.  Ambrose finds redemption of sorts when he purchases and rehabilitates a decrepit amusement pier which draws the ire of the local politicos who want to shut his operation down.  Ambrose has an answer by having the pier declared a seaworthy vessel.  ""All at Sea"" is akin to other Ealing Studio classics like ""Passport to Pimlico"" and ""Tight Little Island"" which share an absurdist sensibility lacking in today's comedies.  The humor is at turns broad yet subtle and you will find yourself in stitches when all is said and done.",1432425600,,917,4.735849056603773
7005845,4,B00TEYPUEO,"I have waited for years for this film to be available on DVD, and I appreciate Warner Brothers' providing it through their Archive Collection.  The film has not been restored to perfection, but it was produced from a good quality master.  There are some flecks of light from scratches, more commonly at the first of the film;  these certainly did not diminish my enjoyment of seeing the film again.  Sound is quite clear.  I would have awarded 5 stars if it had been restored.  Of the Guinness/Ealing comedies, I think this one and ""The Man in the White Suit"" are the best. (B&W, 1.85:1)",1431820800,2,587,4.596153846153846
7005846,5,B00TEYPUEO,This is my favorite Alec Guinness comedy.  A must see if you love wry British humor.,1431475200,,84,4.25
7005847,5,B00TEYPUEO,This movie is really funny.  Great for all ages.,1429142400,,48,4.333333333333333
7005848,5,B00TEYPUEO,"One of the last movies from Ealing studios,""All at Sea"" (""Barnacle Bill"" in England) is very funny at the beginning and end, and mildly funny in between. Alec Guinness appears as Captain Ambrose, the last of a line of famous seacaptains, and as his ancestors, all the way back to a stone age captain who paddles a raft round and round, ""in naval circles."" Sir Alec suffers from incurable seasickness, so he buys an amusement pier as an RMS (Really Motionless Ship) and his quarrels over it with the town council fill up the middle of this short (82 minutes) film. At the end he has some stirring adventures, watched and applauded by the ghosts of his ancestors, and he and the viewers enjoy a surprise ending.",1428969600,2,709,4.590551181102362
8701411,5,B00TEYPUEO,One of my favorite movies of all time. (First saw it in the 50's),1493942400,,65,3.7142857142857144
8701412,5,B00TEYPUEO,"After years of searching, finally found a copy of this movie and I can finally remove one item from my 'honey-do' list. To some people they may remember this movie titled as 'Barnacle Bill' either way this is a great old comedy that the entire family can enjoy. Great copy with good sound.",1492041600,,289,4.471698113207547
8701413,5,B00TEYPUEO,"This movie is a delight. We watch it over and over. Funny and pretty family friendly. My 10-year-old daughter requested it be downloaded to her ipod and she knows the movie by heart (her other favorites are A Majority of One and The Card). She actually even wants to put up framed pics of Sir Alec in her room. The cover is slightly misleading as there isn't any romance involved with this movie. Just the girl on the right (Evie - which is my daughter's name unfortunately) who turns up in various places kissing guys (a life boat, a cabin, etc.). Good opportunity to discuss what kind of behavior is NOT appropriate for young ladies. There is also one reference to the ""sex life"" of fish in an aquarium. I think it goes over my daughters' heads so I am not too worried about it. Overall, a great movie that doesn't lose it's appeal. It is funny and enjoyable no matter how many times you watch it :)",1468627200,,901,4.369047619047619

8701415,5,B00TEYPUEO,Very funny movie. It was the last of the Alec Guinness Ealing comedies. A must to see.,1450569600,,86,4.117647058823529
8701416,5,B00TEYPUEO,"We love the British comedies of this era, and Alec Guinness was the master and commander of these quirky and uniquely English films. The comedy comes from a slight overstatement of people and situations, not from gross misrepresentations of them. I really can't compare this to any other film I have seen. It doesn't have anything to do with the cover art except that Guinness plays a British naval officer. The girls are there to suggest something bawdy and naughty, but that is not what this film concerns. That should be a relief to all Ealing comedy lovers!",1450224000,,561,4.73469387755102
8701417,5,B00TEYPUEO,"I have to admit that when I first saw this movie (on television), I didn't care for it. But after seeing it several times, I have grown to love it. It's one of my favorites, and I'm so glad it's finally available on DVD. I have been begging Criterion to do a version for years now and checking periodically to see if it was on DVD. I actually had given up, but I mentioned it to a friend who told me that it was available.  And it doesn't hurt that I think Alec Guinness is a genius as an actor. It's whimsical and droll, and often not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is totally satisfying. This is a good copy, and I can't recommend it highly enough if you like offbeat British comedies.",1445385600,,685,4.1893939393939394
8701418,5,B00TEYPUEO,Great unusual story with Guinness in one of his best roles - early in his career.,1440633600,,81,4.125
8701419,5,B00TEYPUEO,An outstanding comedy making full use of Alec Guinness's talents,1439164800,,64,5.5
8701420,5,B00TEYPUEO,I have been waiting for this movie to be available on DVD for years.  My favorite comedy of all time.  Guinness plays his character completely straight and the result is very funny indeed.,1436054400,,188,4.666666666666667
