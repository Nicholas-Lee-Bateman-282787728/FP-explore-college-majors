7958077,5,B000062Y3W,"I've been looking for this movie for a long time.  However, don't buy it from Millenium Music LLC!!  They claim the item is in ""very good"" condition, but it isn't.  And they don't package it very well. The cover was broken, which caused the DVD to get scratched.  And they had the nerve to ""request"" that I remove my feedback since I wasn't happy.  This tells me that their rating isn't as good as it seems.. I am sure some people will remove their feedback if asked, but I won't.  I believe that we all have the right to know the truth about our buying experiences, even if they are less than perfect.

But I do love this movie!  Each actor is great in his/her role, and the story is moving.  Very well done.

Side Note:  I looked on their page, and the name is different than the one that shows on the order.  I will never purchase anything from abundatrade again.",1336780800,2,866,4.277777777777778
