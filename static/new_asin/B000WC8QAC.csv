8222480,5,B000WC8QAC,Nice collection of Shaun the Sheep videos,1444694400,,41,5.0
8222481,5,B000WC8QAC,"Shaun the sheep is very clever animation, harmless, non-violent and funny for all ages from 3-103.  If you enjoy Wallace & Grommitt and Chicken Run, these are the same animators, but the episodes are 10 min each.  They show on the Disney channel one at a time, but are collected here.

This is a region 2 DVD - it will play in region 2 DVD players (Europe) or multiregion DVD players.  US is region 1.  How do you fix this issue?

Multiregion issues: if you enjoy English comedy (Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, Mr. Bean), asian movies (esp DVDs from China or Hong Kong), or spanish language movies, each has a different region setting apparently so prices can be set/fixed arbitrarily by the recording industry.  Since some of these items are never even released for region 1, you'll be happiest if you get a multiregion DVD player.  Most Philips DVD players can be reset from region 1 (US) to all regions.  We like the Philips DVP5140 multi region DVD player, but there are many others listed as well as instructions on how to reset the region 1 setting to ""all regions""
(see [...]).

Shaun the sheep is just one excellent reason to get a multiregion capable player.",1266019200,,1165,4.611650485436893
8222482,5,B000WC8QAC,"I bought these as a present for my wife.
She is 49 by now, but Shaun makes her laugh like a kid.  That is fully worth the purchase.  Turns out, I very much like the quality animations myself.
This is something for all age groups, and completely harmless.  The episodes are short, and have a simple theme.  Even a fidgety kid will sit still through each of those episodes.  A perfect addition to a grandparent's repertoire of videos.",1236211200,2,432,4.487179487179487

8222484,5,B000WC8QAC,"Can't get enough of Shaun.  Instant mood improver, regardless of how lousy of a day I've had.  Can't help but laugh when watching.  Clever, witty, hilarious!",1218585600,6,157,4.961538461538462
8222485,1,B000WC8QAC,Region Code...Region Code...Region Code!!!  This one bit us pretty bad on Christmas morning when we learned all about region codes when we couldn't play it on our system.  The US is region 1 and there were no warnings or notes when we ordered it that we would could potentially have a problem.  We definitely didn't think anything of it when the warehouse is located in Florida.  So now we're stuck with this until we find someone with a multi-region player or who lives overseas and wants to buy it.  Learn your region code!,1198886400,8,525,4.602150537634409
8222486,1,B000WC8QAC,"Please beware! I was not aware of the different regions in countries for the DVDs and VCRs. However, I found out after we opened the box to play it on Christmas Day. I think I should have been told this up front in the description of the item. Also, I should have been told this too before I ordered or before they sent it. Or they should have known if I lived in the US I needed one for region 1 and not region 2. Now I may not be able to return because it was opened. I was never aware of the fact of the different regions before so never suspected there would be a problem. Please not not take this as an insault to the seller as far as the quality of the item. The packaging, shipping and the item was excellent. I would still buy from this seller and website in the future. I just am diasappointed about the outcome of this one matter.",1198713600,13,840,4.0359281437125745
8222487,5,B000WC8QAC,I saw episodes of Shaun the Sheep on television while I was in England last summer.  The humor was clever and appealed to adults as well as children.  I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to share it with my American family members.,1194739200,13,241,4.5813953488372094
8222488,4,B000WC8QAC,"Shaun the Sheep is a character based on ""A Close Shave"", a Wallace and Grommit short film that came out during the 90's.  In this TV show, Shaun lives with a flock of sheep on a farm in contemporary Britain. Each show is seven minutes long and revolves around a fun cast of mostly-animal characters going through little capers.

I'm a little biased, admittedly, being an Aardman animation fan. That said, I find Shaun the Sheep to be exceptionally clever, well-produced, and highly rewarding to watch.  I watch most of what my 2-year old son watches, one of my motivations being that he won't be watching anything too brain-dead, and Shaun is the show I enjoy watching the most.  The Shaun stories are consistently of high quality and mindful of both their young and old audiences.  There's plenty of visual and auditory allusion for the old folks, but lots of plain old fun for the kids.

I've shown Shaun to a number of my son's friends and they all think it's a hoot. I think this is the best thing you can add to your family video library collection.

The only reason I can't give this a perfect rating is because I'm reviewing a prerelease DVD, something I haven't seen. If the video quality matches other Aardman videos (like Creature Comforts), I'm sure it will get that 5-star rating.",1194393600,13,1292,4.615720524017467
