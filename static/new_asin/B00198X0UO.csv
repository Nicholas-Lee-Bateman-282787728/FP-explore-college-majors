3425871,5,B00198X0UO,"As a child born in the '70's and growing up in the '80's, these movies meant a lot to me.  I have so many childhood memories of playing with my nextdoor neighbors running around yelling ""1.21 Jigawatts!!!""

I haven't been this excited since the movies were first released to DVD.  Multiple viewings have not taken anything away from the whole trilogy experience.

I am proud to be able to own these movies in a high-def format to continue sharing them with my own children and eventually....my grandchildren.

Long live Back to the Future!",1278979200,3,539,4.752688172043011
3425872,5,B00198X0UO,"One thing I have always been a stickler for in all of my DVD purchases is special features. The 25th anniversary edition of the Back to the Future Trilogy will indeed contain all of the same special features as the original trilogy pack. In addition, there will be a six part, retrospective documentary. All of these features will be available on both the DVD and Blu Ray eitions of the 25th anniversary trilogy pack. This pack is to be released in October (I believe the 26th). Enjoy!",1278115200,7,485,4.586206896551724
3425873,5,B00198X0UO,I can't not wait until the back to the future trilogy comes out on blu-ray on October 26th 2010. I am realy excited for this release in a 3 disc set. One of my favortie movie series of all-time.,1278028800,,194,4.0
3425874,5,B00198X0UO,"Back to the Future represents to me the ""Golden Years"" of 80's SciFi...

With the Blu Ray it will reach, for sure, a level of richness in terms of all, picture, sound and extras...

What i would suggest is for the studio to make a ""Limited Edition"" of 1500 or 3000 Box Sets, with glossy cartoon covers, post cards, film cell for parts 1,2 and 3, book with hard cover (with 200 pages...) like they did with E.T.

I think the fans deserve that...

My most luxurious edition is the Trilogy in Laserdisc, Muse Hi-Vision, each movie individually in a Box Set, like books with booklets, in 1080i HD, so having Blu Ray will be another progress...",1277942400,,639,4.435897435897436

3425902,5,B00198X0UO,"This is an exhaustive examination of the phenomenon of the films. This features four disks. Disk 1 is the original film which is about a teen who is inadvertently sent back in time where accidently interrupts his parents getting together, thus his very existence is at risk! A beautiful film. As I reviewed it one thing that came to my mind was that it appears any problem should be resolved with...fighting? True, it is a movie, but...hmmm. He has to figure out how to get back to his rightful time. The extras include two different director commentaries, deleted scenes, the genesis of the idea feature, casting and recasting, and the car. A second feature is about the possible title change, background, location, plot situations, music and poster work, and a 3rd feature is about music.

Disk Two is the second film which is about the main character going into the future and encountering his older self and his children, then back to an altered then current time, and then all the way back to the original movie where it is then viewed from a different perspective. Considering how difficult it was to accomplish the first time this can cause some anxiety! Extras include deleted scenes, extended scenes, actor replacements, accuracy of 2015 predictions, behind the scenes, make-up, and that #2 & #3 were made back-to-back. A second feature is a scientist discussing the prospects of time travel and how accurately it was handled. Again, director commentary.

Disk Three is the characters going to 1885 where Doc Brown finally gets to have a relationship and Marty has to be the voice of reason. Explains that the town was actually built for the film. President Reagan actually mentioned the film in a speech! Mentions the ride and the animated series, car owners and then a feature about the Ride Experience.

Disk 4 includes a making of feature, a gag reel, making of #2 and #3. Kirk Cameron hosts a 'Secrets of' feature and mentions the ride. concludes with people who have gotten involved with fund raising for Team Fox. so much data that it begins to repeat itself. HOURS of data.",1511568000,,2090,4.816155988857939

I have a 65"" LG OLED E6 with the Samsung K950 Dolby Atmos soundbar, and the picture quality is off the charts; the movies are remastered in DTS-HD and the audio quality is wonderful.

3426002,5,B00198X0UO,I wrote a review a year ago on this complaining about no sound during movie play back. I have since redone my home theater and I decided to try it again and voila!! I must of had a setting set wrong someplace. Even though all my other blurays worked.  This is one of those movies where the more you watch it the more you pick up stuff you missed over the years the subtle sarcasms and overlapping jokes it's a must see. The only thing I would say that has changed for me is their use of blaspheme in these movies detracts a bit for me at this point.,1467590400,3,549,4.036697247706422

3426182,1,B00198X0UO,"My review is not of any of the 3 movies which I recall seeing shortly after their release in each of the respective years of release. My beef is with the seller: BuyBuyEnjoy. Plain and simple, the Blue-Ray 25th Anniversary version of the ""Back To The Future"" Trilogy simply won't play. I have the Samsung BD-J5700 model Blue-Ray player on which I have not have any problem playing Blue-Ray Discs. This Trilogy is the first in Blue-Ray discs of any type the player won't play at all with any of the three discs. I put the disc in the player, it's loaded and what I get is nothing, but the UNIVERSAL LOGO just spinning in the middle of the TV screen endlessly, until in frustration open the disc tray take out the disc and that's all she wrote. I've tried numerous times, even experimenting with the remote to see if I can the disc to initiate playing the content of the discs regardless which disc. I get the same thing over and over. I know one thing I'll never do again is not play it immediately after receiving Blue-Ray or a DVD disc. My fault for waiting more than 30 days to try to play these discs. Your fault for obviously Selling me what I would think are defective discs. This Trilogy has cost me over $40.00 which includes a Maryland sales tax. I can't be the only one who has ran into this issue with this particular set of discs. The Samsung BD-J5700 Blue-Ray Model is barely a year old, so it's not as if it's out of Date. Obviously these discs were manufactured recently. The right thing for the Seller: BuyBuyEnjoy is take my discs back and make a full refund to me of what the Trilogy cost me, which was over $38 exclusive of the Maryland state sales tax, but if the seller refuses, not only will I not buy anything in the future sold by BuyBuyEnjoy, I hope that anyone who reads this thinks twice about becoming its customer.",1451692800,,1842,4.373177842565598

This really could(and probably should) be considered the best time travel movie and story of all time. They have a killer cast and a great crew.

3426283,4,B00198X0UO,"Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's something to think about.

I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.

The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.",1446249600,,1046,4.529100529100529

Instead I got the one for Europe I think, because it has German, Japanese, Turkish audio and subtitles. Also the digital copy codes are just for England and Irland.
I'm very disappointing with this purchase because I sent it to a P.O. BOX and ship it to South-America. The audio in Spanish was a must because my 7 years old son loves this movie and his not a english speaker.

The situations he finds himself in are hilarious since an 80s kid in the 50s would find himself in a completely different world. Then Marty goes to the future. He creates problems that make it necessary to go back to the 50s again. This time it is really hectic trying not to be in the same place as himself on his previous visit. In the last movie Marty goes to the old west to recue ""Doc"". Comedy, music, adventure, shoot-outs. It is a great adventure and lots of fun.",1438560000,,575,4.284403669724771

3426563,4,B00198X0UO,"Love this trilogy since I was a kid. The picture quality is good but not great but the sound is awesome. This is still really worth buying for a better picture quality as a blu-ray disc. Now having said this, the website product info was misleading. On the product picture you don't see anything that might suggest it is not from a North American region Blu-ray but they're not and even the product description has a regional format as ""All regions"" which should have given me a clue. Now in Amazon's defense this was a not an Amazon direct sell. This seller was ""Snowman"" and had a great price under the prime membership with quick and easy delivery which was nice. But the digital copy given is invalid since it is only for the UK and Ireland region. I really would have liked to have known this before hand as it does influence your buying choice. Either way the discs play just fine on my Blu-ray player and I am happy with my them but I truly wish I had a digital copy for when I travel.

3426694,5,B00198X0UO,"Ever since first viewing this trilogy set, I haven't been able to remove it from the player. After viewing every second of these discs, I'm in awe of Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale in particular because of how they approach filmmaking. Having Spielberg produce didn't hurt either :) The commentaries really shed a lot of light on the film. I enjoy listening to Bob Gale and could sit with him all day long and talk about these movies. It seems as if everything came together just right for this to become what it has. If Eric Stoltz would have been Marty, it would never have been the same. There would probably be no sequels either. The fact that they were willing to scrap 5 weeks of shooting just so they could have Michael J. Fox is one example of the lengths they were willing to go to in order to make this film to succeed.

From the actors and their performances, to the musical score, BTTF is one of the most well done and most inspiring movies ever made. To me, the most amazing thing about this film is how well it holds up after having watched it many times. I can watch it day-in and day-out and never get sick of it. Before learning the whole story behind the making of it I still felt this way, but now it's completely different. I really feel like I got to know the cast and crew and be a part of what they went through to make this happen. Obviously, the first film is the crown jewel and says everything that needs to be said without the sequels even needed. The characters in this film are unrivaled. When people say, ""They don't make 'em like they used to."", this statement is true of certain music genres (jazz, classic rock, pop, etc), it's also true of films - most of the AFI's Top 100 are prior to 1980. Even though a lot of 80's films are cheesy (thinking teen sex comedies and horror movies), many are memorable, especially the comedies, John Hughes films for example, however, BTTF was able to cross into many genres. Some people even consider this ""sci-fi"" because of the time travel aspect (also the tech of the future in Part II - I think they officially call it ""a comic sci-fi film""), but it also has a lot of romance, drama, comedy, coming of age, western!...I think that's why this film is so lovable on a broad scale. It speaks to multiple generations, types of people, and holds up to time, thirty years later. So much to love, so rich and deep with story and character development.

One last thought that I think is important to discuss....Part II is definitely under valued, under appreciated, whatever you want to call it, but it's better than most people think. Bob Zemeckis said that he doesn't like doing the whole ""future"" thing because it's always wrong. However, for this movie they had to go there, and I understand why they had to go there. Connecting the dots to Part III (which is another masterpiece), was done very well. They had to come up with something for the future, so they poked fun at it. I love the flying cars (remember, these films were made in the 80's before digital technology!), the Texaco of the future, the 80's cafe, the hover boards....all that was really cool. Then there is the future Marty and family, where Jennifer sees her older self, the older Marty gets fired, etc. I do like the house features with the ""Mom, you sure can hydrate a pizza"" line, Michael J. Fox playing multiple parts and the use of the VistaGlide camera system (which was made for this movie). The greatness of this movie comes in two parts, in my opinion. The first thing is the overall message..... how things can seriously go wrong if power gets into the wrong hands. I love how this was written. The alternate 1985 is awesome. The Biff documentary is priceless!!! Secondly, they go back into the first movie and see it from the current Marty's perspective. That entire sequence was groundbreaking at the time. Since then, it's been done countless times in time travel and sci-fi films. How it was done in BTTF 2 is still the best and most convincing because of how they have interaction between both versions of Marty and then Marty with Biff, etc. It's just really, really done well. So thought out and wonderfully executed. Oh and don't forget the end of the movie! I love the 70 year letter delivered to Marty by Western Union. Bravo!!!

If you're still reading this, thank you very much :-)

In conclusion, I just wanted to say that every movie has its imperfections, even my beloved Back to the Future, however, even with its minor flaws, I still love every bit of it and call it my favorite film of all time. I consider it the best simply because...(1) I'm in awe of what they were able to do with these movies given the limited technology they had at the time; (2) The Story and the Music are absolute perfection; and most importantly... (3) the CHARACTERS!! I mean, come on... Doc Brown?!?! Marty McFly, George, Lorraine, and the best bully ever...Biff Tannen!!! Its not only characters and character establishment, its casting, its how those actors are able to pull on you emotionally and carry the film. This kind of depth in filmmaking just isn't there anymore. Technology has gotten in the way somewhat, as well as there being nothing original anymore. We need to go back to the days when directors depended more on their actors, strength of the script and overall story to make the movie work. This is one of those films that stands the test of time in every way. People always say, ""Star Wars, Indiana Jones, insert your favorite film or trilogy here, and yes, Star Wars is epic, however, if I had to put films on a spectrum of temperature. Star Wars would be in the cold zone.while Back to the Future would be in the warm zone. thats the difference for me - a much more comforting, ""feel good"" type of experience. BTTF gets it right on every level.",1429574400,2,5807,4.501421800947868

3426705,5,B00198X0UO,"Back to the Future trilogy.  Need I say more?

Ok, if I do, here is what I'll say:  You either know the movies or you don't.  If you don't, I'm sorry for you.  This is one of the few titles you can't live in USA and not know (like Star Wars).  I'm sure every single red-blooded American (yes, I am an American and proud of it) knows something about this movie trilogy.  Michael J. Fox plays a teenager who goes back in time accidentally and meets his parents as teenagers.  He makes a few mistakes, causing a chain reaction in the time line that will eventually cause him to not exist.  He fixes it only to end up going to the future in the sequel and messing things up there, causing the present to be turned upside-down.  In the third sequel, he goes to the old west to mess things up there yet again.  It is a time-travel nightmare!  This trilogy is filled with comedy, romance, teenage fights, and so much more.  If you are into sci-fi movies, enjoy a bit of comedy, and can handle the graphics of the 1980's, then pick this up and watch it!  The graphics will NOT be as good as they are in newer movies such as Avatar, but hey, the first movie came out in 1985!  That was before computers were regularly available for every home.  So...get past the graphics, enjoy the comedy, and laugh till it hurts!  I'm glad I finally found this trilogy on Blu-ray.  I have not gone through the special features, but I'm glad I have them for when I get time to do so.",1428537600,2,1459,4.22463768115942

3426756,5,B00198X0UO,"You know the movies. You love them. I won't get into that.

What I will get into is the quality of Back To The Future on blu ray in stunning HD. The print quality is exceptional. And I mean truly exceptional.

It wasn't until seeing it in stunning full HD that I realized just how amazing the details are in this series. From Part 1 they really go to great lengths to recreate the 1950's and you pick up on a lot of that detail in HD. Part 2 has a ton of little background items and vibrant colors that jump off the screen and bring you into the movie in this format. Part 3 has a ton of detail to authenticate that old west feeling. You saw all of this before, but never really noticed it until you've seen it in high definition.

These movies were all filmed in much higher quality that was capable of being delivered at the time. Now that they've received the full remastering in HD I feel like I've finally seen Back To The Future in its true form for the first time.

The special features of the Blu Ray set are impressive as well. There is a lot of 'making of' stuff that I'm a total sucker for. The best part, in my not even remotely humble opinion, is all the original scenes for Part 1 shot with Eric Stoltz (Some Kind of Wonderful main kid, Pulp Fiction drug dealer, etc..) as Marty McFly. That's right...Marty McFly was originally cast as Eric Stoltz. Fox was the actor they wanted from the start, but he wasn't available due to his Family Ties commitments. Stoltz just wasn't working out as the character just wasn't lovable through. So they figured out a way to work around Michael J Fox's Family Ties filming schedule and half way through the movie all of the scenes that featured Marty were reshot with Michael J Fox. You can see some of the original scenes with Stolz in the special features. It's like being in the Twilight Zone.

You also get a lot of fun facts from the special features. For instance many of the scenes from the 1980's occur at night. This wasn't an artistic decision. This was because in order to get Michael J Fox while he was in production of Family Ties they had to film at night. Interesting facts like that are littered throughout the special features of Back To The Future on Blu Ray",1426550400,,2226,4.315789473684211

The video transfer is perfect and by that I mean It feels like watching film, not highly polished 21st century digital HD (which I also love).  The movies are silly and very much a part of that terrific genre of childish sci-fi that worked some 20-30 years ago.  The honesty of 1980s film quality makes the special effects feel legit (also childish when compared with Avatar).

Great addition to the library.",1422748800,3,523,4.641304347826087

3426914,5,B00198X0UO,"I heard they were going to make a documentary series about my adventures over the centuries. Man let me tell ya. They hit the nail on the head with these. I would say each installment is about 98% accurate to what took place. Part 3 being the most. A few things I would like to address, 1. I really did not want to go on a date with my mom. Doc explained what happens if I do not, I just didn't want to relive it in the theater. I  have been seeing a shrink for quite some time because of it. 2, Biff really isn't that bad of a guy. He's just a little slow. His family on the other hand, well let's just say lots of paint chips and led have been consumed. 3, ZZ Top still kicks butt even in 1885. Some things I would have like to have seen are my adventures during the roaring 20s, contributions to averting the Cuban missile crisis,  my attempt to stop Yoko from meeting john (too many weird things were changed and I had to go back and let them meet) and lastly the Boston tea party.
I would also like to address that yes, it is 2015 and no you have not seen hover boards mass produced yet. This is because congress is currently blocking Tesla from developing them for Apple. I am currently trying to pinpoint when this butterfly effect occurred. Someone in Biffs family is to blame. I know that much it's just figuring out which cousin and what date.

3427098,4,B00198X0UO,"Quick story recap; Marty meets Doc who invents time travel. The entire series focuses on them traveling from the past, present, and future to fix the problems they created each time they ventured through time.

Micheal J Fox just sells it as Marty McFly.  He makes this movie very enjoyable especially being paired with Christopher Lloyd who plays Doc. But the characters are wonderfully done like Biff and George McFly.

Very iconic movie set.  A must own.  Watching these movies is always enjoyable.  Great cast, sets, plot, pacing, and humor.  The first installment is classic by itself but the second one is cool in that it lapses over moments of the first, really neat how they put it together.  I love all three installments. Highly recommend them for any age group.",1419465600,,772,4.8396946564885495

3427106,5,B00198X0UO,"I was so glad when they came out with the Back to the Future: 25th Anniversary Trilogy on Blu-ray. It contains one of my favorite time-travel story lines. I wish they'd come out with a part four for Back to the Future. It would be fun.

(It's possible that you might be able to get this title at a bargain during Black Friday or Cyber Monday 2015. I got a nice price on these dates in 2014.

Even at the prices Amazon normally sells this for, it's still a great deal.

What else can I say about Back to the Future? What would you do if you were in the past butt had a book of sports statistics from the present that you came from? Could you keep yourself honest, or would you take advantage of your inside information. That is just one element where time affected our heroes and villain.

I love time travel movies. This collection takes us not only to when his parents started dating, but it takes us into the future when he has kids, and finally, into the distant past when his ancestors live in the old west.

We have good guys, and we have bad guys, and we see people change their outlook from one point of time to another. A bully in the past becomes obsequious in the present when a past milquetoast learns to defend himself.

We see how past events can change the future. When Marty's parents become more confident about themselves in the past, their kids change from lounge-about lazy-bones to successful and confident professionals in a revised present.

This is a wonderful series, but you probably already knew that before you read my review.

I highly recommend this Blu-Ray set to you.

The Picture has been retouched from it's original format from the 80's/90's era of release to a modern day masterpiece. I have owned the original movies on VHS in the late 90's and compared to those, this set has been visually great. The sound is good, the picture is amazing for even modern day LCD Tv's, and It's Back to The Future. The Film series holds near and dear to my heart and I was thankful that I was FINALLY able to get my hands on this copy. Comes with 4 discs, 3 movies and a bonus movie disc with extra features. They all come with deleted scenes and Commentary from the production crew. The extras are pretty fun and entertaining.

I wanted to get it for our next gen--granddaughters--to see (with their mother's permission--rated PG, and they're 8).  Also, I wanted to see a modern hi-def version, and there, it does not disappoint.  Super high quality picture.  The extras are OK, too.  Interesting the scenes that were thrown out.

I wasn't going to spend the money on the Blu-ray, but I figured, what the heck it is a classic that needs to be archived in it's perfect form.

You are forced to watch previews as they download with no way to stop them. I finally had to disconnect the internet AND power off the player to make it stop downloading previews.

3427171,4,B00198X0UO,"I really liked the original Back To The Future movie so much many years ago that getting this trilogy on blu-ray is a good choice. The transfer isn't as good as I expected for blu-ray but was still very detailed with excellent sound which greatly enhances the movie experience.

There are plenty of extras with things I didn't know about these movies. Knowing now, still, does not up my opinion of the second movie; It's just not that good but, it can be entertaining especially for younger viewers or those who want to follow the progression into the third movie. The third movie may be considered the best of the three movies because it has the best visuals with a more diverse setting. Plus, it mixes action with some intrigue and, of course, a love story.

Overall, this is a great trilogy to have in my movie collection.

Note: I think the standard DVD is probably a better choice since the blu-ray transfer seems to be only as good as the movies' first release where a standard DVD can easily accomplish this. Also, the standard DVDs have the 5.1 DTS audio for excellent, full-range sound.",1412640000,,1095,4.605128205128205

Back To The Future: Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a typical American teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a plutonium-powered DeLorean ""time machine"" invented by slightly mad scientist Dr. Emmett Brown [Christopher Lloyd]. During his often hysterical, always amazing trip back in time, Marty must make certain his teenage parents-to-be, meet and fall in love otherwise he'll never be born...

Back To The Future - Part 2: A visit by Marty and Doc Brown to the year 2015 seems to resolve a few problems with the future McFly family. However, when they return home, they discover someone has tampered with time and Hill Valley, 1985; they must once again get back to 1955 to save their future.....

Back To The Future - Part 3: Mary Steenburgen joins the cast for this rousing conclusion to the popular series. Stranded in 1955 after a freak burst of lightning, Marty must travel back to 1885 to rescue the Wild West Doc Brown from a premature end. Surviving an Indian attack and unfriendly townsfolk, Marty finds Doc Brown is the local blacksmith. But with the Doc under the spell of the charming Clara Clayton, it's up to Marty to get them out of the Wild West and back to the future...

Andrew's Blu-ray Review - There are a few films that I'd consider a big part of my youth. Many of my memories growing up in the 1980s involve casual scenes sitting in front of a large Zenith console. You know the ones, with the gaudy wood panelling all around and the stereo speakers on either side. On that, I made countless viewings of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show,' the first two 'Indiana Jones' movies, 'Grease' and 'Back to the Future.' Of those, the adventure of a teen musician traveling through time was the most awesome thing ever! I couldn't get enough of it. I simply cherished the sci-fi comedy as much as any boy could. From the story and characters to the look and special effects, 'Back to the Future' was the best movie ever made. Next to `Raiders of the Lost Ark' and especially The Indiana Jones Framchise of course. And if you asked me to pinpoint the moment I fell in love with movie-magic, this would probably be it.

The concept is deceptively simple, but something most people can easily relate to. Many have probably even imagined it at least once in their lifetime. Producer and co-writer Bob Gale was inspired with the thought after discovering his father's yearbook. What if you could hang out with your parents when they were teenagers and discover they were drastically different from the adults they grew into? He shared the pondering with friend and director Robert Zemeckis. Together, they wrote the screenplay, and with the help of friend Steven Spielberg, 'Back to the Future' was quickly on its way to becoming one of the most beloved movies of the decade. The entire plot revolves around this straightforward, nearly universal idea. And the script is genius in conveying this without making it blatantly obvious, practically perfect in its structure and delivery.

Another big part of the film's success is without a doubt the excellent and memorable performances of the cast, especially Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. At the time, Lloyd was an unknown to younger audiences, but everyone knew precisely who the uptight, Young Republican Alex P. Keaton was. Playing against type, Fox is believable and comical in the role, and likely a major reason why many teens flooded theatres. We may not have been familiar with Lloyd when the movie premiered, but today, the actor will forever be remembered for his portrayal of Doc Brown. He's charismatic and amusing, keeping viewers glued to the screen, waiting for whatever bizarre phrase he'll say next. Marty's friendship with the wacky scientist feels oddly genuine and realistic, which is essential for making the entire series work. And the two actors succeed without fault in this department, making us want to see more of their madcap adventures.

If 'Back to the Future' could be viewed as a nostalgic look at 1950s pop culture and the sequel as homage to the science fiction genre, then the third and final instalment to the series is a loving tribute to the western.

As a devoted fan of the genre, this last entry in the now-classic film series in my book ranks higher than the second movie. And like the original exploring the decade that introduced rock 'n' roll, this story has fun in the epoch that gave rise to science fiction novels with several mentions of the French author Jules Verne. After watching the previous two, seeing this combination of fantasy meets the American West can seem a bit awkward and rather outrageous. But with that little historical titbit being alluded to by Doc and his love interest, Clara [Mary Steenburgen], the plot feels right at home with the six-shooters, train robberies, and damsels in distress.

25 years later, the 'Back to the Future' series continues to capture the imagination and deliver the laughter. It's possible some of its enjoyment is partly nostalgic. But it's also likely these really are well-made, entertaining and highly creative films that haven't lost any of their fun. And in this era of remakes and reimagining's flooding theatres, revisiting older movies somehow makes us forget that Hollywood seems to lack any vision and originality right now, that it fails to make us believe in the magic anymore. Nearly 30 years later, the 'Back to the Future' trilogy endures as a better movie-going experience than many, many other films of late.

Blu-ray Video Quality - One of the most anticipated film trilogies finally arrives on Blu-ray with a wonderful and impressive 1080p encoded image and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. According to an interview, producer Bob Gale participated in the restoration process, which was done from an interpositive using a 2k resolution scan. And the results are first-rate, as the movies have never looked this good on any other format. Since all three films received the same treatment and appear identical in terms of quality, they are being graded as one complete package.

All three movies display great definition and clarity, whether we're watching Marty narrowly escape the clutches of Biff/Griff in the town square or riding the wild plains of the Wild West. Granted, there is some minor noise reduction applied and some slight digital tampering used to sharpen and clean the picture a bit, but it's nothing so objectionable as to ruin the quality of the film. We've seen much worse done to other favourites, and only the most discerning of viewers are likely to notice. The image still retains a very fine layer of grain and shows several strong moments of dimensionality. Fine object and textural details are exceptional for a catalogue title of this age. They're not always consistent, which is understandable, but it's much better than anyone could have expected. The worst instances are during the optical effects, where matte lines and softness are made more apparent. But again, this is a normal result of the available technology.

Contrast is spot-on and brightness levels are well balanced with deep, accurate blacks and brilliant whites. Facial complexions aren't very revealing, but they appear natural and healthy in all three films. The colour palette is vibrant and dramatic, especially during scenes of the 1950s in the first two movies. Primaries are lush to give the transfer some great pop, but it never feels gaudy or artificial. Part III, of course, places more attention on the secondary hues and earth tones, showing a very pleasing range and also providing the video with a cool, gritty impression. Taken as a whole, the classic 80s trilogy looks terrific on Blu-ray.

Blu-ray Audio Quality - The sci-fi comedy also comes well equipped with a highly enjoyable 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. As one would expect, much of the presentation is centred around the dialogue, and it's delivered with terrific precision and intelligibility. We can clearly make out the unique, distinctive inflections and utterances in Michael J. Fox's voice and the funny, high-strung tone in Christopher Lloyd's wacky scientist.

The front soundstage feels wide and welcoming with plenty of strong clarity detail and good channel separation. Dynamic range is surprisingly extensive and even far-reaching, never faltering at the higher frequencies. But the original design, of course, shows its age somewhat in this audio department as the differences happens and comes into play during the time-traveling sequences. Movement and directionality are attractive and persuasive, especially when the DeLorean travels through time, creating a fun and satisfying sound field. It's during those same moments that the lower frequencies are made known, spending the majority of the runtime pretty much in silence. This is rather surprising because gunshots tend to feel a bit flat, but bass is present to give music some depth. This isn't a matter of complaint, just something worth noting.

Discrete effects in the surrounds have been added to the audio for ambience and to extend the imaging with slightly more activity. There are clear moments where we can hear birds chirping in the first movie, cars flying in the sky in the second, and crickets singing in the open range of Part III. Anyone intimately familiar with the movies will notice them, but they're not distracting and don't feel forced. Alan Silvestri's now-iconic and memorable score receives the biggest upgrade by spreading evenly throughout the entire system and engaging viewers at just the right moments. For fans, listening to the composer's signature brass-style will likely be the highlight of these lossless mixes. In the end, the 'Back to the Future Trilogy' sounds awesome on Blu-ray, and fans couldn't ask for anything better.

The image quality is spectacular on all of the films, and you've got both new HD extras, as well as legacy features from the older DVD sets. On top of this, there are multiple commentary tracks for each film. If you're like me, you'll be binge watching these movies and extras.

3427357,5,B00198X0UO,Enjoyed this when it first came out and even more so in BluRay. Although first conceived as a comedy it gets rather dark with the character of Bif becoming even more the villain in the second film.  The concept of time travel is carried fairly well as far as changing future events if we were able to go to the past and interact with ourselves and others. Thankfully the science conveyed in these films didn't get carried away with itself and left everything quite entertaining.,1401580800,,478,4.623529411764705

The seller I got this box set from was reliable to say the least. The package came on time at least. As for the condition of the item, not so much. The item was found on top of all the packing material which consisted of a few big air filled pouches. It was left exposed at the very top and I almost stabbed it when I started to open the package. The box was so small that the item almost jumped out of the package when opened it. When I saw the item, the paper sleeve's corners were all compressed and the same situation was said for the rest of the packaging.

3427443,4,B00198X0UO,"This review is about the packaging, not the movies (which are great to meh in descending order). Why does Every studio that creates multi-disc box set have to pack them in customized, horrible, difficult to use, damaging to the discs-packaging? Back to the Future Trilogy is no exception. What's wrong with disc spindles? It's only six discs (including digital copy discs), not twenty, so why Universal felt it was necessary to lodge these discs in inflexible, brittle, plastic side-tabs is beyond me. In order to pull the discs out you need to wedge your fingers under the sides of the disc, on the disc-read side, and unsnap it from its housing. Same goes for the digital copy discs although those come out more easily.

Putting the discs back in is a mysterious process that involves unnerving amounts of plastic grinding against plastic, and 'pinching' of the disc to get it to fit back in under the tabs, none of which is good for the longevity of your remastered blu-ray collection. I wish movie studios would get over trying to innovate with standard boxed collections like this and just stick with what works.

I give the collection four stars because the movies shouldn't be penalized for bad packaging, but it's really the first movie that's the winner in the bunch. The second movie was decent, but it doesn't age as well. The third movie, like most third movies, didn't really need to happen, and is just a poor postcard of its era. Great to have them all in one place, so I'm glad for that, but these movies are not created equally.",1391904000,2,1545,4.697416974169742
3427444,5,B00198X0UO,"I have to confess that I did not grow up with this movie (I was and still am more of a video game person than a movie person, though I did watch Disney films and other films as a kid, but let's not go into detail about that) - I just saw the first Back to the Future film less than a year ago after renting it on Netflix, but I still loved every minute of it! I later got the entire trilogy on DVD for Christmas, and I can gladly say that this compilation is worth owning.

I didn't see every bonus feature, but I definitely watched all three BttF movies before writing my review. I don't want to spoil any plot details, but out of all the movies in the Back to the Future trilogy, my favorite one is the first one - I also like parts 2 and 3, and they're on par with each other, in my opinion. All three movies have a good sense of humor, as well as great characters (my favorite characters are Marty McFly, Doc Brown, and Biff) and fun storylines. Oh, and the main theme composed by Alan Silvestri is absolutely phenomenal!!!!! The movies are all presented in widescreen, and look and sound excellent, they look like they just came out recently! There are a ton of bonus features too, like commentaries for all three films, the 6-part Tales from the Future documentary, and even the Back to the Future ride, to name a few. The only real complaint I can think of is that it's only a tad difficult to get the discs out. Part 3 and the bonus disc are also on top of each other inside the packaging. May not be the greatest packaging, but whatever, I recently got used to it.

If you've never seen every part of the trilogy or haven't watched Back to the Future at all, or if you're a BttF fan who wants to see the many bonus features and you don't own the films anymore, this compilation is a great purchase, whether you're buying it on DVD or blu-ray.",1391904000,,1851,4.182072829131653

3427468,5,B00198X0UO,"Back to the Future is the first movie that I watched over and over again, like an obsession, as a child. I thought it was the coolest movie known to man. I don't know what it is about this trilogy that I love so much. Perhaps it's the whole DeLorean time machine that takes you back in time, or to the future, that really appealed to me. Or maybe it's Marty McFly's ""You don't scare me, I'm not afraid of anything"" attitude that intrigues me. It could also be the duo friendship between a carefree teenager and a mad scientist that made me enjoy it. I'm going to say it was all of the above. This trilogy reeked of awesomeness. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox made a good team for this trilogy. I enjoyed the friendship they shared because, while they may have been two different people who grew up in different generations, they still cared about the welfare of each other. Both of their characters were very likable.

BTTF part 1: The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back thirty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence.

Part 2: Marty McFly (Michale J. Fox) has only just got back from the past, when he is once again picked up by Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and sent through time to the future. Marty's job in the future is to pose as his son to prevent him being thrown in prison. Unfortunately, things get worse when the future changes the present.

Part 3: Stranded in 1955, Marty McFly receives written word from his friend, Doctor Emmett Brown, as to where can be found the DeLorean time machine. However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend's aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher. Using the technology from the time, Marty and Emmett devise one last chance to send the two of them back to the future.

I bought this trilogy a few years ago on the Walmart.com website and I'm very happy with the purchase. I'm glad that I didn't have to buy all three movies separately. It's been a while since I've watched them, since I'm pretty busy nowadays, but each time I watch them, It's always an enjoyable fantasy experience.

I often wonder how Marty met Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown. I thought that maybe Doc was a friend of Marty's parents or something, and then from there, became good friends with Marty. That's how things worked with me and some of my older friends. Things don't always work out the same way for everyone though, so it's doubtful that that's what happened. I'm sure that anyone from any generation would enjoy this DVD set. It's also now available on Blu-Ray for those who have a Blu-Ray player.",1389744000,,3175,4.476683937823834

I've been a fan of the series since they were released, owned them all on VHS and am incredibly happy to now own the blu-ray edition.  The video quality is impeccable as is the sound.  There are plenty of extras, behind the scenes, documentaries, etc, and it definitely makes this collection worth while, even if you had the DVD version that was released a while back.  This set is generally found at a great price for the amount of content you get and if you're still collecting discs is a must have.

A great add on is the Back to the Future Ride footage. But, it seemed better when you are on the ride than watching it on the Blu ray, but I liked it.

2. the box containing the 3 discs is nice and compact.

I will rave, however, about the quality of the Blu Ray transfer of the movie - in Blu Ray, it is crystal clear - I was floored by how crisp, clear and gorgeous the Blu Ray transfer was.  I viewed it on a 65"" Panasonic VT60 Plasma, and it was beautiful.  Not all Blu Ray transfers of older movies fare as well.  What is also nice is the movie is 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen which means you get to view it full screen - no ""watchband"" like 2:35:1 here... that is always nice.

What is a bonus is that after almost 30 years, I STILL enjoy these movies.  And more importantly, so do my 13 year old boys - which says a lot about how well done these were - it is very entertaining.  I saw the original first movie in the theaters when it first came out, and I am still entertained from beginning to end.

So here we have a timeless set of movies which is still entertaining today, and one where the Blu Ray transfer allows you to watch it in crystal clear HD.  Awesome.

5 stars all the way!!!

Regarding this purchase, I received the item and unfortunately none of the 3 discs worked in my Blu Ray play and or Laptop. What can I do? This has never happened to me.

3427678,5,B00198X0UO,"the trilogy is great - as always. looks great. sounds great. so, what more does the fans want? plenty of extras. but, i have to be honest, Part 3 is the weakest of the trilogy, but, yet, i watch it. you know?",1376784000,,208,3.9761904761904763
3427679,4,B00198X0UO,"Back to the Future is about a teen who travels back through time to meet his parents and change the future. While I would rate the films 5 stars and the bonus content gets 4 stars. There is over 10 hours of special features. This Back to the Future set contains all three films. The extras are great with commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, mini-documentaries and trailers but there could have been a little more to make this truly comprehensive. BTTF has so much in the vault. Many of the special features are audio-only or text-based and the documentaries involve only Bob Zemeckis, Bob Gale and Michael J. Fox. I would love to see the workprint of the original with Eric Stoltz. They filmed almost the entire movie with Stoltz before he got replaced by Michael J. Fox. I imagine they don't want to pay him for the rights now but I bet BTTF fans would love it. We see only a few silent clips of Stoltz in this release. Also, new interviews with Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Claudia Wells, Marc McClure, Elisabeth Shue, Eric Stoltz and others would have made it even better. We do get the vintage 21 minute 'Secrets of the BTTF Trilogy' documentary with Kirk Cameron that used to be on its own VHS tape in a 4-pack back in the day.

Buy this collection. This is the best release available for Back to the Future (making the DVD collection obsolete). My only complaints are that the ""25th Anniversary Blu-Ray Trilogy"" release adds little except remastering from the DVD collection (a bonus disc could easily be filled). Fortunately all the deluxe content has been ported over.",1376697600,2,1586,4.684587813620071
3427680,5,B00198X0UO,I've been eyeing this blu-ray like a hawk and I never seemed to have any money to buy it but I finally did. I grew up watching Marty McFly travel in time and it was one of the things I enjoyed the most of my childhood.  I don't regret buying this because this is the kind of movie that when I have kids I will play for them and they'll play to generations to come. So OBVIOUSLY I strongly recommend. The picture is fantastic!!! It's simply worth every penny!,1376352000,,458,4.146067415730337

Even though my review is a bit late in coming, (3 years to be exact!) I just want to mention how much I enjoyed watching all three parts of BTTF. The bonus section is a wonderful addition to the set and it's a real pleasure watching them as well. I never knew til now that there was another actor before Michael J. Fox who tried for the part of Marty McFly...
The quality of all digitally restored  movies are excellent indeed.
Definitely worth watching time and again. This time with my children.",1375056000,,612,4.368421052631579

Not only do i get the three movies that I haven't been able to watch in a while, but all the bonus features have made this set even more enjoyable to watch.  The true bonus was these very entertaining movies packaged at a very reasonable price was another bonus to this purchase.  Back to the Future series was great entertainment when they came out and I enjoy them even more now today with the bonus features..",1375056000,,555,4.216981132075472

3427710,5,B00198X0UO,I love this Trilogy. The blue rays look good and clean.  I'm glad they include the entire ride from universal studios on this because I never got to ride it.  Wish they had a real commentary track with the director and actors though.,1374019200,,233,4.395348837209302
3427711,5,B00198X0UO,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love the way they weave the same scenes through all three movies. I never get tired of watching these over and over.  The plot shows how just changing one thing in a persons life has an amazing ripple effect. The alternate reality in in the second movie shows how power can corrupt when in the wrong hands. In the end  of the third movie Marty grows up and matures and conquers his temper.  Highly recommend the trilogy,1373932800,,468,4.295454545454546

The cover was in TERRIBLE condition, on at a strange angle and permanently bent/scratched up pretty bad, the plastic shrink wrap was all jagged and half pushed open. I ended up throwing the cover away and wrapping it up anyway since there was a time issue. Any other time I would have sent it back with the quickness and never accepted such unprofessional shipping practices.

Not happy about the quality with shipping this in a box with other items and causing it to get ruined. The movie quality itself I am told is fantastic. It's just too bad he lost out on a cool cover.",1372118400,,635,4.38135593220339

For this purchased I paid less than $18 for all 3 movies, yes that includes shipping.  I also like Michael J. Fox.  There are tons of extras and interviews.  It is worth buying if you like any of these movies.  Brand-new disc and in great condition.",1371513600,,344,4.3125
3427735,5,B00198X0UO,"Watching these Blu-rays brought back so many memories.  The 80's were so comforting to me.  It was before every movie was filmed with a handheld jerky camera and as much cursing as they could cram in.  Also, it was before the age where everyone had to have a reality show.  The picture quality is very good, but I really can't judge, because I've only watched them on network tv.  The soundtrack was very clear, especially hooked up to surround.  The only negative for me, which is not a part of the movie, is the deleted scenes.  The picture quality was horrible switching between parts of the movie and a deleted scene.",1371513600,,621,4.54054054054054

3427739,5,B00198X0UO,"I bought this because I was a teen back when it first came out and it was one of those iconic films of the 80's. With my kids now approaching their teens, I wanted to start going through all the classics of my time and share them. I had put this trilogy in my cart and was planning to pick it up a few days later and was quite pleasantly surprised when just before summer hit the item went on sale, dropping the price further (not that it would have made a difference, Amazon's regular price was already a few dollars lower than one of the retail stores where I'd seen it).

We have now watched the first two of the trilogy and I must say that although I cannot disagree with critics that feel the first film is the best, I must also concede that the series as a whole has aged remarkably well. It remains collectively entertaining and inventive; perhaps Zemeckis's best work. Good performances all around, and fun for all ages, though there is a little cussing (some of which make up part of one of my favorite quotes of all time from George McFly). And I'd forgotten how dark the second film gets.

I won't get into plots and such here as you'll find plenty of that elsewhere. But the films look pretty good on Blu Ray and at Amazon's price I can't complain. Repeated viewings are also worthwhile as each time I seem to find little sight gags that I missed on previous viewings, all three are filled with them. I've been reading some of the reviews of the film elsewhere and can't believe how bad the ratings are from some critics...if you had to choose between the millions of crap films made in the 80's and this trilogy, it's not even a contest.",1370649600,,1650,4.336569579288026

Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc and it's so good to see Michael J Fox before his parkenson's became evident. I think the 1st and 3rd movies are the best but you won't fully understand the 3rd without watching the 2nd movie. My favorite is Back to the Future 3. Doc gets a great role in that movie, and hey it's got everything! Romance, cowboys, Indians, shoot out, music, dancing, train crash and oh the flux capacitor too! Small amount of swearing in the movies and some cleavage but nothing too objectionable.",1366588800,,613,4.482142857142857

3427795,5,B00198X0UO,"This is so great to have as a DVD set! I love the contrasts in these movies - and the way the people grow and move around.  There were things that my husband and I noticed for the first time while watching these DVDs that we had totally missed in all of our many previous viewings of these movies! The way Doc and Marty almost switch roles in the third movie slipped past me when I was younger, but is a lot of fun (and very life-like) once I did recongize the change. The production notes and the ""who was originally cast for the role"" information was very interesting, too.  I highly recommend this trilogy.  It is great, and lots of fun to add to your video library!",1364169600,,669,4.2109375

3427917,5,B00198X0UO,Back to the Future has never looked better.  The Blu-rays are faithful to the original filmed material and nothing has been softened or re-vamped.  What you get is good old fashioned film grain like it was intended.  There's nothing wrong with your HD set.  The first film was shot on grainy Kodak film stock and the visual effects are dated somewhat.  Big deal!  Get over it!  This is the same film you remember from all those years ago and it's never looked better.  The sequels look even better because they were shot back to back on newer film stock.  You can't beat the price or the quality.  I owned the DVD 3 pack before--this set even has the DVD's (which are very unnecessary by the way!).  Everything arrived in great shape and on time!,1358294400,2,746,4.492537313432836

If you are particularly prone to enjoying the Back to the Future trilogy than this is a nice DVD set to embrace into your collection. It contains not only all 3 movies but some never before scene footage of how the films were made. This series is a family favorite and gets watched at least once a year. There is something amazingly wonderful about time travel and the idea of changing one's future and past. The fantasy gets lived out through these films. Doc is a fun character who probably would be a little creepy in real life but is in his element as the mad scientist who pulls Marty into adventures within. In doing so, Marty gets to change his parents lives and in doing so his own.",1357344000,,808,4.429530201342282

I thought the first BttF looked the best and was the best film of the three.  BttF 2 wasn't as good as I remember but still a lot of fun and the third was a great close to the series.  Here's hoping they never make a 4th one.

The extras were great and well worth checking out.  They included all of the old features from the past releases and made a new six part documentary.

Having seen the films in syndacation & on DVD, I already knew what to expect story & plot-wise but going back in again & speaking character-wise, I noticed that the main character is basically this ""Master Of Ceremonies"" type. Although he's supposed to be the main character alongside the scientist, he influences the other characters as well & doesn't have direct influence on the plot. in the first one, his parents are the main characters & the third, the scientist gets the main character role. Going on to the plot of the 3 films, the first is the standard ""fix what you created"", the second took on a darker tone & the third is basically the first film all over again.

3428123,5,B00198X0UO,"I'm not a particularly picky DVD/Blu-Ray buyer. If the price is fair, all I really need is for the movie (or tv show) to be presented at a high level of quality. The other aspect of a set that satisfies me is if the makers demonstrate a respect for the customer by showing they've made a real effort to provide a good product. This can be done through good/plentiful extras, by cleaning up the audio, sharpening the image, or just by giving cool and functional packaging.

In all regards but one, the Back to the Future Trilogy Blu-Ray set comes through with top marks. My one criticism is of the strange disc holders that make removing the disc an unnecessary test of patience and coordination. Why the discs can't be held in a normal, easy to remove/replace way, I just don't understand.

That said, look at everything else: The movies, of course, are amazing. The first one is the best, but both sequels are fantastic, as well, adding to the story and not just rehashing the first movie. The picture quality is stellar, as is the sound. For those who like to delve into extras, there are more than enough.

Fortunately, after several more emails, this time to Universal, they sent me the authorization codes and I was able to successfully download the digital copies.

Then I looked at several recent reviews, and saw that several people had gotten new Digital Copy codes from Universal within the past two weeks. So I contacted Universal from their Digital Copy site on June 13th, and received new codes last night (June 18th). I can confirm that the new Digital Copy codes worked, and I now have all three movies in my iTunes library.

I am deducting one star since I had to contact Universal to get the Digital Copy codes, and their reply took more than two business days (it was three business days for those counting).

6/28/2012 Update:

I purchase movies to enjoy, not to review. Plenty of others have already critiqued the plot of the movie, and have also digested the visual quality of the Blu-ray transfer. So I am sorry if you didn't appreciate my original ""review"" that was pointing out that Digital Copy codes, which were said to be included in the Amazon description, and were actually missing from the package I received. I do deduct point(s) for missing parts, and would have actually deducted half a star if Amazon allowed.

So the only thing that I am going to say about visual quality is that while it has been a while since I have watched the DVD version of the trilogy, I can tell that the Blu-ray transfer is superior to the DVD (as it should be) -- and Universal didn't manage to ruin the visual gags in Back to the Future II, as was the case with the original trilogy DVD transfer (which is the version that I owned). But I am not the kind of person that measures charts with a digital camera; likewise, I am not going this watch a movie, or any other, and find every last flaw (visual, plot, etc.)

I will also go ahead and thank Universal for including Digital Copies of all three films, instead of UltraViolet ""copies"".",1340064000,2,2029,4.497282608695652
3428158,5,B00198X0UO,"To all the people who just posted before me complaining about the expired digital copies - did you actually try to redeem them?

Also the enclosed Digital copy discs did not work for me at all for the transfer (itunes on Mac OSX), iTunes asks for a redemption code for the digital download, but there is no code/insert included in the package to get the digital transfer to iTunes. This is true for all the three parts of the set. It's very disappointing to not able to get the digital copy of this to watch on my iPhone. Contacted Universal with the problem, will update the review based on their response.

Update 6/13/12: I received the Digital copy transfer codes for iTunes from the UniversalHidef support team in 2 days. The codes worked and I could transfer the movies to iTunes. FYI - they don't have a toll free number. The only way to contact is via e-mail.

This Trilogy Blu-ray package is well worth every cent!
From the complete movie series to the Universal Studios ride and trailers, this disc set has it all. I normally won't buy a box set but I'm very happy I bought this set. The first movie looks amazing and the picture and sound are fantastic. In my opinion the 3rd movie's picture is on par with any modern release originally recorded in HD. In short, buy this set, you won't regret it!
Just one note.

Note: This set is LOADED with every extra feature you can put on a Blu-ray disc. Our junk Samsung BD-D6500 has presented several issues from audio dropout to freezing picture. I don't blame the disc as our player is unreliable at best. When I would try to go back and repeat the problem, it would play fine. I can't wait for my new Panasonic to arrive on Monday!!!

The end credits for Part I are not right on the Blu-ray or the 2010 special edition DVDs. Most obviously, they're presented at 75% their proper width, but if you look closely, you'll see that they're tilted somewhat, and off to the left. Universal's home video department refuses to acknowledge even that this is a problem, let alone correct it and issue replacements (you'd think they'd be used to it by now!). It's been a year and a half. If I can't spread the love, I need your help to spread the WORD, and bring justice to this awesome trilogy!",1334793600,5,916,4.518072289156627

3428261,5,B00198X0UO,"Unfortunately the blu ray review is stuck with dvd and even vhs as far as I can see. Why Amazon does this is too save space , but it makes it harder to deal with. The blu ray versions of these movies come in a nice pack. all three flicks. Just like other packages of movie sets you can't get these seperate yet.  And this three movie series is worth owning by any standards. The first flick is a modern classic and movies like it come around rarely. The two sequels were decent and fun movies and while not classics they are pretty good movies. At this time we are almost 30 years away from this flick and even close to where the second one takes place in 2015, we aren't as advanced as that one would be , but who cares , the 80's could rightly look back in nostalgia at the fifties and we can now look back to the 80's with nostalgia. Fun rock and lots of wild styles etc. The Blu ray package is well done and the movies look great , they remastered them here and they have never looked better. which is more that can be said of many other movies just slung out on blu ray these days. There are tons of extras too so that's a huge plus. Obviously this is a series that needed this treatment and thankfully we got it  here. THe price is steep for a new one it should have  been no more than forty brand new , but on amazon.com it's cheaper anyway.",1327104000,5,1348,4.06015037593985

In fact I recently cleaned up my DVD shelf and traded in or sold most of my old movies but there are a few that I will forever keep. One of which is the Back to the Future trilogy, this to me is one of the greatest movies of all time. I grew up watching Doc brown and Marty, I've ridden the ride at Universal Studios and it's just a great movie.

The Blu-Ray edition takes you back to the classics, only the sound is enhanced and pictures are a bit more crisp. In fact there are some close up shots on people where  you just think they shouldn't be shown in blu-ray format because of obvious makeup lines that are more apparent in hi-def then standard DVD. BUT, it's a great movie, I go back to it time and time again and I love the enhanced sound this blu-ray edition brings, like the story board mode which as you watch the movie pops up story boards so you can see how the came up with the scenes (optional viewing mode).

3428281,3,B00198X0UO,"This is very tough to rate fairly.

The movies are exactly what any BTTF fan expects them to be.  My hubby was thrilled with the extras and seeing it in blu-ray meant he was noticing little details he'd missed before (and he's such a huge fan that we headed off to the ""Twin Pines Mall"" parking lot before we opened this up, so that's saying something).

That said the whole BD Live thing is beyond frustrating.  It was taking forever to load the discs even when our net was at its best, so we turned off BD Live - which improved nothing, then it just whined at us - how dare we turn it off.  I'd love to give this 5 stars given how much this series of movies means to the hubby, but with all of this glitches, I can't.  If you love the series, yes -- you will love the blu-ray quality and the extras, but the BD Live is a pain even if you turn it off it seems to keep trying to worm its way back into your attention and freezes everything up, pause the movie a few seconds too long and it will freeze up,  it's basically a very glitchy set up and was actually the first thing I've had to return to Amazon in the decade or so I've been using them... The second copy was a bit better, but it has also frozen multiple times.  The stars it does get are for the movies, extras, and behind the scenes stuff (5 stars there)... if I were rating it solely on their BD live set up, it'd be 1 star as that was implemented very poorly.",1325721600,2,1424,4.024822695035461

3428305,4,B00198X0UO,"Im writing a review on the 25th anniversary edition in comparison with the fullscreen version. I watched both the fullscreen and the widescreen versions of this side by side and I noticed the video was messed up or different in this widescreen edition.

I have some screenshots I took that show what im talking about.

[...]

In this first screenshot at the part where the doc is pushing the button on marty's shirt to get it to the right size for him. You will notice in the widescreen version you can see more on the left and a little more on the right but just a little. The bad thing is, the top is cut off plenty. Look at the vent above the doc's head, its cut off alot. The fullscreen version show the same amount and more at the top and bottom but has just a little bit cut off of the sides. Overall I would rather the fullscreen version at this rate.

[...]

In this second screenshot comparison At the part where the doc tells Marty to look for a guy named gryph and hands him 50$ You will notice in the widescreen version you can see a very tiny bit less on the left and a little more on the right but just a little. The bad thing is, the bottom is cut off plenty. Their pants and torso are cut off. The fullscreen version shows about the same amount and more at the top and bottom also a little more on the left and less on the right

Overall it seems that the fullscreen version shows the full video from top to bottom and the widescreen has the top and or bottom cut off but a little more on the left and right sides of the video. So basically the amount you gain or lose on the top, bottom, left, and right are about equal. If they cut off the pants on the bottom of one part in the widescreen version, you will notice you gain a piece of the car on the side or other things on the sides that could not be seen in the fullscreen version. Overall it looks like you get more picture with the fullscreen version.

Aside from those video things to consider the packaging was very nice and well set up. you won't have to worry too much about discs coming loose and getting scratched.

After emailing universal I decided to try again a couple hours later, I start with Part II code and allows me to redeem! So I try Part III code and again it works, finally the first Part works too! I don't know if it has to do with the email or it was just the iTunes redemption system. I tripled checked the codes when submitting them.

For those who buys the trilogy, the sheet with the codes included specifically says ""may be invalid after 11/30/11"" so you may want to buy at your own risk if wanting the digital copy.

3428349,5,B00198X0UO,"I had the first pressing Blu-ray release of the Back to the Future Trilogy, with the digital copies and that horrible packaging, with lifting up the discs from a weird angle. Well, all of those discs got scratched, which resulted in disc-skipping, and I think the packaging was the culprit. So, I double-dipped to get this set, sans the digital copies (which I never used) and new, simpler packaging, with the standard pegs in the middle that you just push down like with every other DVD/Blu-ray, as opposed to those awful wings. Just push down on the peg and pick up the discs and you're good to go! This should have been the first pressing, with the digital copies being available for download, kind of like the Jurassic Park Trilogy set, instead taking up 3 extra discs and more shelf space, which, by the way, I also love the slimmer packaging, it's about 2/3 the thickness of the first pressing case, so it fits much nicer into the collection on my shelf.

Since I didn't review the first set, I'll just give my take on this set, since they're pretty much the same, obviously except for the digital copies and case.

Buy this set through the Amazon third party listings, as I got mine for under $27, after shipping costs.

Movie: Back the the Future: My all time favorite movie. It's classic and quotable. If you say anything nasty about this movie, then we can never be friends, 6/5. Back to the Future Part II: Big letdown, lazy screenwriting, it just recycles a good chunk of the first movie. My least favorite in the trilogy, 2.5/5. Back to the Future Part III: Not quite as good as the first movie, but leaps and bounds better than the second. Nice to see Doc Brown grow as a character, finally really pushing forward the main character status, as opposed to the sidekick-like status, just there to feed lines off of Marty, 4.5/5. Overall trilogy rating, 4.5/5.

Video: There is little to no DNR used here, or if it was used, then it was used very conservatively, because details remain intact, including some you might never have noticed on previous home video releases. Very sharp, but the only reason I'm taking half a point off is because of aliasing. For example, look at Marty's jacket during the school dance scene towards the end of the first movie, it's there. Kind of distracting. But still, very good looking picture. 4.5/5.

Audio: Crisp and clean. Dialogue is 100% audible and intelligible. The music (songs and score alike) is loud and dominates the sound stage. Nice use of 5.1 surround sound, even though these were originally stereo mixes, which is obvious, since they're so front heavy, though it would have been nice to include the original stereo mixes for comparison's and purists' (come on, don't be bashful) sake. However, it never feels truly immersive, like the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, or Pixar movies, but more of a faux-surround mix (Pro Logic II, anybody?), as in artificially created from the original stereo mixes, not natively 5.1. So, again, I must dock half a point. But still, very good sound. 4.5/5.

Extras: Nice to see all of the same special features ported over from the 2002 DVD, and the ride, along with new documentaries, if you want to learn what went into making all of these movies. No more digital copies, but for me, that's a plus. 4.5/5.

Overall: I would like to give Universal a 5/5 for this second pressing, since the packaging is simpler and hassle-free. But as I said in the first paragraph, this should have been the first pressing, because you know the old saying, ""Do it right the first time"", and I must dock half a point out of principle for those of us who wanted this type of frustration-free packaging the first time around. But if you didn't buy the first pressing, and are a huge BTTF fan, get this set, you won't regret it. 4.5/5.

Note: this review was written by me on Blu-ray.com, but since I cannot give this 4.5 stars on Amazon, I'll just round it up to a 5 out of 5.",1319846400,8,3952,4.587818696883852

3428374,5,B00198X0UO,"I am always hesitant to watch movies which I loved in my youth (boy, that makes me sound old!) - but after getting this set I was VERY pleased that I had bought them. This series still holds up and looks terrific.

Content - Movies
The movies are rightly referred to as classics. I won't bother summarizing the plot since if you are reading this you already know it and if you don't - boy you are in for a treat! All 3 movies are great, my personal favorite is the first followed closely by the third. The writing / planning was so well done that they hold up as independent movies but it all does make more sense if watched in order. I had a great time introducing these to my 6 and 8 year old kids - and they loved them as much as I did / do. Warning - there is some rough language (mostly the ""s"" word) which I had not recalled from watching these years ago.

Content - Extras
The additional content for all 3 movies is super. There is a many-part series of well produced interviews with all surviving stars and producers / writers / makeup people, etc. Unlike the bonus materials provided with some other movies, these shows really give insight into the production and how problems were solved along the way. After watching the extras I really felt as though I had been there and had an insider's view. There are also sets of still pictures and ""archival"" materials which are prior ""making of"" type shows from years ago. It was interesting to see some of the same people in interviews separated by 2 decades describing things in almost identical words. The experiences of making these films obviously were indelibly burned into the memories of cast and crew alike - their recollections presented in the bonus materials were clearly oft-repeated stories told with fondness.

Picture Quality / Sound Quality
The transfers are clean and bright. The detail is almost too good, especially in scenes in the first movie where the young actors are in ""old"" makeup. The image is so razor-sharp that the outlines of the prosthetics used on their faces stand out. I am very pleased they did not choose to use a lot of DNR (digital noise reduction) as going that direction would have been far more distracting. Sound quality is also great.

Overall, I recommend this set without reservation and with much enthusiasm. I suspect these discs will be watched many, many times over the next few years in our home.",1318464000,,2400,4.548611111111111
3428375,5,B00198X0UO,"I've always been a huge fan of this trilogy. I remember watching them mostly on VHS and TV throughout childhood. We all have those movies that give us the nostalgic feeling of home, this is definitely one of those for me, and I imagine many others. Odds are, you're not hear looking for a review of the movies themselves, you probably want to know how the quality of this Blu-ray release is. It is truly amazing. Probably mostly due to my memory of the VHS and TV versions. Even without that, it still stands strong against many other 80s Blu-ray releases. I've had several friends tell me ""it looks fake"". These people are, of course, not experienced with Blu-ray and a 120hz HDTV. It definitely looks fake, in a good way. The opening scene of the first movie totally blew me away. I was hooked. It felt like I was watching it for the first time. The colors are more saturated, the contrast pops and the blacks are deep, all that typical Blu-ray review lingo is appropriate here. If you're a fan of the movies and you enjoy awesome video quality, this is a MUST OWN! To top it all off, there are more bonus features than there is movie.",1318464000,,1137,4.419047619047619

3428378,4,B00198X0UO,"In ""Back to the Future,"" Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is part of a family with many issues caused by mistakes made in the past.  He has an unlikely friendship with scientist Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), the inventor of a time machine, and winds up accidentally going back in time three decades from 1985 to 1955.  There, he must maneuver in order to get his future parents to become interested in each other--then he must find a way ""home"" to 1985.

When Marty goes back in time, there are several amusing situations in which people of different generations get their wires crossed.  The plot is engaging and entertaining, but the one big flaw in the movie is that the viewer has to suspend disbelief a bit during the climactic scene between Marty's father and the school bully--it just isn't completely believable.

Nevertheless, ""Back to the Future"" is regarded as an Eighties classic, serving as a vivid reminder of the impact our actions have on our future.  President Reagan even enjoyed the movie and quoted from it in one of his speeches.

Also included in this DVD set are the other two movies in the trilogy.  The second film is set in 2015 (a date that seemed far, far away in 1989 when I first saw the film in college but, unbelievably, is now only a few years away), and the finale has Marty and Doc travel back to the Old West of 1885.  The third entry is better than the second, but neither of the sequels measures up to the original.  There is also a disc containing deleted scenes and other bonus features.

The films in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy might not be suitable for younger children to watch due to language and other issues, but these three movies teach the virtues of courage, foresight, and independent thought and would be great for adolescents (adults would enjoy them, too).",1317340800,,1815,4.623052959501558

3428417,5,B00198X0UO,"Universal certainly has done it up right in re-releasing the Back to the Future franchise as they have done this time around. This four disc set comes with a remastered Back to the Future(July/85),Back to the Future 2(Nov/89),Back to the Future 3(May/90) and a special features fourth disc,but more on that later.
I usually go into plot summaries but by now these legendary films' plots are well known by most so I'll just skim the surface. All the film's two main stars are Michael Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as ""Doc""or Professor Brown. The first film introduces us to the BTTF world as Marty works part time helping Doc clean his work and experimental environment. One day the Doc has plans to test his theory of time travel using a Delorean car. The plutonium which powers the flux capacitor which powers the car was stolen and the Doc gets killed before he can go. This forces Marty to drive it and he goes back to 1955. He finds and meets his parents and he also meets and convinces the younger Doc to help get him back to 1985. Back in 1985 he prevents the Doc from getting killed,but Marty soon realizes they have changed time somehow,as things are quite different at home. While he's taking this in the Doc appears from the future and whisks Marty back with him to prevent a tragedy from happening involving Marty himself.
In the second film we find the Doc and Marty trying to prevent Marty's future son from being arrested. Marty poses as his son and gets the job done. However Biff,Marty's nemesis from the first movie,is now rich and famous and married to his mother. It seems the 1985 Biff has given a sports book to his younger self,who has bet on every event in the book and racked up alot of money in the process. In order to correct this they travel back to 1955 to retrieve the book. When they try and leave together the Delorean(driven by Doc)is struck in mid air by lightning and disappears. Moments pass when he is approached by a courier who gives Marty a 70 year old letter. It is from the Doc in 1885. Marty goes back to the 1955 Doc for help.
The last Future involves the year 1885 of course. Marty and Doc in 1955 use the info in the 70 year old letter to locate and repair the Delorean. Marty returns to 1885 to retrieve the Doc,but knowing the Doc will be killed if he doesn't get to him in time. Marty manages to circumvent things but the Doc falls in love and will eventually marry and have children(there would be no future Docs without this happening!).Along with this is the problem of getting the car up to speed to return in time to 1985. The Doc determines the only solution to be to push the car up to speed via a train. This they do in a harrowing running battle with Biffs' own ancestor. As they dematerialize from 1885 to 1985 onto the rail tracks which still run on the same spot,he barely gets out before the car is demolished by a modern train. There will certainly be no more time traveling for Marty or Doc. Moments later the Doc from 1885 appears in a train hovering over the ground just to let Marty know all is well and to leave him a picture of he and his family. The film ends as we see the Doc roar back to....?
Imaginative,well written and smart these films will leave you on the edge of your seats from start to finish. The plots will also sometimes leave your head spinning as you try to keep up with the changing time lines and whether it all jives or not. The supporting cast is wonderful throughout and the two main stars give excellent and unforgettable performances. As if a remastering of the films wasn't enough,they have added a fourth disc into the mix filled with special features. There is a six part documentary on the film,deleted scenes,several featurettes,the Power of Love music vid,audio commentaries with each film,a look at the Universal studio theme park BTTF ride,and more.
Technically each film is in its a/r of 1:85:1 and the sound and picture have never looked better than this.
If you have fond memories of the BTTF franchise,fasten your Delorean seat belts for this four DVD set. The films sparkle like never before as you re-discover this wonderful set of flicks all over again. Highly recommended.",1316217600,,4193,4.503937007874016

3428419,5,B00198X0UO,"If you are Lorraine you are a good mother, but the haze of alcohol doesn't hide your regrets of decisions past.  Your husband George McFly is a good man, but he's bedeviled with a crippling fear of failure, has a low-level job, and meekly puts up with his bullying supervisor Biff.  Between you, you've had three children, your youngest is Marty . . . .

If you are Marty McFly you are a high school student.  You fantasize about being a rock star.  You get around on a skate board, but dream about one day owning a 4 x 4 truck.  Unlike your father, you stand up to bullies.  You are smitten with Jennifer Parker and your best friend is Doc Emmett Brown . . . .

If you are Emmett you are a scientist who draws his inventive inspiration from Thomas Edison.  While many in Hill Valley may call you a nutcase - and it is true, that you have tinkered about, building many contraptions of dubious value - but now, at last, you've invented something of significance: a time machine . . . .

You got the idea 30 years ago for an electronic device that has the capacity to join the present to either an instant in the future or the past.  For it to work: it must be moving at 88 mph; therefore you encased it in a car.  Its power requirements are enormous; unfortunately, tricking some bad guys out of their plutonium was a bad idea . . . .

It wasn't for the second movie (though the second movie is worth the demotion) but for the graphics being too good. Yes, too good. The graphics were so good you could see the actor's make-up. I don't think the producers expected to see this in high definition so you can really see the make-up and masks when they are trying to disguise or age a character.

I'm so glad these came in. We watched them all almost instantly and intend to do that every year or so. I love traveling back and forth through time with Marty and Doc!

PROS:I am very happy with the quality of this Blu ray. As you may understand, this quality didn't exist when the movie was released. A studio had to remaster the video and sound of this movie frame by frame. This is a very tough job, and tougher to do it this well. From the moment I hit play, it was like I was watching the movie for the first time. (Ok maybe not the FIRST time but close enough). Digital copy is a heaven sent plus. I love digital copies. The quality is better than a lot of the digital copies I own.

CONS: When you enjoy a movie like this much you like to view the extras. Some of these extras seem to be unprofessionally short and unedited. Some features, from the moment you hit play to the moment you're back in the menu only about a minute passes. Some features have no narration and just makes you feel short changed. It feels like they put all their resourced in making the movie look great and then ran out of $ to make decent extras. This is the reason I did not give it 5 stars.

Overall I think this is a great Blu Ray trilogy and would recommend it to anyone.",1309219200,,1183,4.112554112554113
3428491,5,B00198X0UO,The formatting on all 3 movies is great.  It looks like they fixed all of the complaints for the previous releases.  The digital copies are useful for taking the movies along on a laptop without having to bring additional DVDs.,1309219200,,227,4.65
3428492,5,B00198X0UO,"Saw these movies growing up as a kid, I loved them then, and I love them even more now in HD. I was a little nervous about the packaging because I heard a lot of negative things about it, but I think they updated it. I had no problems with taking the discs out everything was smooth. I also love the holographic slip cover looks great! The first Back to the Future is a classic, the second one wasn't bad, and the third one was a great way to end the trilogy. Once I seen amazon was selling it for $24.99 I had to get it. Its a great addition to my collection.",1309132800,,560,3.9646017699115044
3428493,4,B00198X0UO,"I hopped on the blu-ray wagon a couple of years now, and as I go catching up with buying and watching some initial releases, I keep discovering old reviews that clearly show their age now and should be updated according to current standards.

Because, quite frankly, I really doubt the same reviewer would say today that these movies are free of the dreadful DNR. That may be the case with the first part of the saga, that shows a healthy layer of grain, but both parts II and III have been scrubbed of most grain, which shows up turned into digital noise instead on the 2nd and it's mostly absent on the 3rd installment, which fares the worse of all three.

It's only too bad, because, other than that, light and color seems to be spot-on for the whole trilogy.

So although I gave a 4.0 score for the trilogy as a whole, separate and more accurate scores for each video presentation would be 4.5 for Part I, 4.0 for Part II, and 3.5 for Part III.

Audio for all three movies is an adequate recreation of the original, warts and all, with the logical limitations in dynamic range for films of that time and age. As it's usual with most 5.1 modern remixes, channel separation sounds too artificial, and I think we would have been better served with a 2.0 surround mix (although it is my understanding that at least the 1st movie enjoyed a 6-track mix on 70mm prints).

As for the extra features, there's little room for complaint here. The newly produced 6-part ""Tales from the Future"" documentary leaves almost no stone unturned, although there are some interesting tidbits from the prior 3-part ""Making of the Trilogy"" (also present here) that were left out (for example, ""Tales from the Future"" bring us footage of Eric Stoltz as Marty for the first time, but makes no mention of C. Thomas Howell having been considered for the part, as we learn from part 1 of ""Making of the Trilogy"").

All in all, it is quite a joy to revisit the memorable saga with such a good audiovisual presentation and accompanied by such a trove of additional material.",1308787200,3,2048,4.551630434782608
3428494,5,B00198X0UO,"The package arrived quickly, courtesy of my Amazon Prime account.  The movies came in a tri-fold case, with a shiny cover sleeve. I like the artwork on the package, simple and not cluttered.  To my surprise upon opening up the package, I found six discs, three are the actual blu-ray movies, and the others are the ""Digital Copy"" versions.. You need these discs to be loaded up into your computer before you can download them.  I am sure these discs are there as some sort of Digital Rights Management (DRM). I was expecting a leaflet with a code and website to download from, but that just may be my expectation derived from my Downloadable Content (DLC) experiences from game consoles.

The film seemed grainy, the audio however was superb. I don't have a fancy setup, I watch my Blu-Rays using my Playstation 3 connected to my TV via HDMI. It seems that the movie studios are taking a generic approach to the menu options. While there were some animations, it felt very similar to other Blu-Ray menus, which i suppose is fine, kind of bland and boring in my opinion. I really dislike the load new movie previews from the Internet, fortunately if you mash the menu button you can bypass most of these.

The films themselves have aged well, as they still manage to keep me entertained from start to finish. I did not notice any aspect ratio issues, that other reviewers pointed out. All in all a solid product, and an awesome set of movies. I would recommend to anyone who has a blu-ray player, based on my audio experience alone.",1308355200,,1531,4.593406593406593

I immediately put all three onto iTunes via Digital Copy. Then all day I sat and watched one of the best trilogies ever. Perfect. For the price I bought it at ($14.99) Best decision ever.

3428509,5,B00198X0UO,"It's about time that someone figured out a (BETTER) way to keep discs securely in place.

How many CD's, DVD's, or BD's have you opened, only to find the disc loose inside the cover?  How many disc cases do you have, where some of the center hub tabs have broken off and no longer secure the disc?  How many times have you thought you were going to break a disc, bending and twisting it, struggled to get it out of the case, because the center hub is too tight?  This is a problem that needed addressing years ago.

If disc packaging was this way (spring loaded bottom with edge tabs) from the beginning, and all-of-a-sudden, packaging was switched to the center hub method, people would REALLY be complaining.  This new packaging is a much better way to keep discs secure, in place, without coming loose in storage or transit.

As for the center hubs that don't have the little plastic tabs that break, that do an excellent job of securing the disc, ...  In many cases you need to twist and bend the disc to get it off of those tight hubs.  Many reviewers (see Planet Earth) have broken their BD's, attempting to get them free from center hubs that are too tight.  Damage or breakage seems to be the misconception that reviewers are having with this new packaging.

With the new packaging, there's no need to bend the disc.  It won't become dislodged in storage or transit.  The chances of scratching or damaging the disc by removing and replacing it, are very much less.  This is a better way to secure the disc in its packaging and easier to remove and replace, once you know the secret!  But until this packaging is standardized or ""the norm"" ...

I won't be likely to loan it to anyone without giving them simple instructions, first!

I recommend this Back to the Future Blu-Ray Collection for all the positive reasons mentioned by others.  I also recommend you learn how to remove and replace the discs PRIOR to doing so.",1307664000,6,1927,4.520231213872832

3428526,5,B00198X0UO,"Imagine this: An empty parking lot at night, A grey van parked somewhere in the center, two figures are visibly examining something behind it. Time passes and one of the figures is down on the ground, the other has disappeared into the vehicle behind it being chased by a van of pursuers. The vehicle is grey and metallic in color, and looks very angular and futuristic. You'd think it was a normal car, but it's equipped with various mechanical parts mounted all around it. The two vehicles speed around the parking lot, but it's the grey car that takes your interest. It speeds at a drive-up photo hut and continues to accelerate. You'd think it's going to crash, it's inevitable! But instead it defies logic and physics, snap hissing as its attachments open up a portal, in which it disappears into a blue vortex in an instant. The only sign of its existence is a burning duel trail of tire tracks that light up the black pavement.

If you haven't guessed where the scene came from already and what I'm about review, it seems obvious that you've stumbled here by accident or maybe you are just following a recommendation. Whatever the reason, you're here!

""Back to the Future"", a science-fiction movie that primarily portrays the 80s in which it is set, defined a generation and a time period and revolved around a teenage boy (Michael J. Fox) and his journey backwards and forwards in time with his older eccentric scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd). Along with an all star cast and a highly acclaimed director, writer, and producer (Robert Zemmerick, Bob Gale, Steven Spielberg); this is an instant classic with universal appeal. I'm not here to spoil the movie (s) for you so if you want a plot summary, you'd have better luck with IMBD or Wikipedia. To note, the success of the first movie spawned two additional sequels that also appear in the box set: Part II and Part III. I'm here to review the Back to the Future 25th Anniversary Edition DVD set that was released in 2010. Breaking down the Price, Presentation, Special Features & Bonuses, and Packaging; we will dive into the most definitive box set for the Back to the Future films to date!

""All right, give me a Pepsi Free."" ""You want a Pepsi, PAL, you're gonna' pay for it."" - So retail-wise, it's been sometime since the thing was first released ($50), so the price has gone down over time and now you can generally get it in the $20-30 range. You'll want to save money and it's a bargain to get all of this for such a low price. I did manage to find my new copy at a wholesale store at a cost of $13, so word of advice is to shop around to get the best deal.

""Time circuits on."" ""What do you mean ""Time Circuits on""? Doc, we're not goin' back now!"" ""Yep."" - Presentation is better than expected for a re-release of an old classic. It's been 25 years since the first movie came out, and in that time home video formatting has gone from full screen to widescreen. You now see much more than the VHS versions of the 90s, and the cropping problems that plagued the 2005 edition of Part II and Part III have been remedied. Not only this, but the films have all been digitally re-mastered in a way that breathes new life into these classics. The footage is crisper and cleaner, and more details can be seen. The audio has been also improved and allows a wonderful 5.1 surround sound compatibility that draws you into the movies through voices and the famous 3-note theme song. The menu interfaces are easy to navigate and pretty interactive as well! If you really want HD (1080i) quality though, you might want to head on over to the Blu-Ray version and check out that.

""Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?"" ""The way I see it, if you're gonna' build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?"" - The special features are much more numerous than what you'd expect from most box sets and include a variety of original and new content to watch after the feature films. The typical behind-the-scenes features are included and show the work put into maintaining continuality as well as quality into the trilogy. All of the basic features include commentary, deleted scenes, and more. But the appealing features that are shown include newer interviews and retrospect featurettes into the films now that so much time has passed. Getting to see the cast and crew together and talking about the experience and things untold is just wonderful. Along with the disc features described on the disc, there are also digital versions of the movies for your high-tech mobile device (IE: iTouch, Cellphone) as well as an offer for a free copy of Episode 1 of the 2011 episodic game series, ""Back to the Future: The Game"" by Telltale Games. The amount of content is just staggering and this is only a glimpse at the full content.

""No wonder this circuit failed. It says ""Made in Japan""."" ""What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan."" ""Unbelievable.""  - Finally we get to the packaging which for all purpose and intent is appealing even to look at. What you have is a thin cardboard cover slip that is holographic and has a flip out front that shows you all of the features that are featured in the packaging. Once that is off you'll have a fold-out, four paneled interior that is an exact copy of the cover slip, but inside holds all of the discs of the packaging (seven in all!). What follows are three movie discs, three digital download discs, and a bonus disc full of the older content. My one negative comment on this product as a whole is located in this section. You see, the disc holders aren't your typical easy ""push middle"" type of a format. Instead to have a very flimsy plastic that looks like it can easily break and two indents for each disk for fingers. What you'll need to do is not push and tug like a normal disc holder (that would break it), but push and lift from one of the two indents for the disc. It's unusual to think that Universal decided to do it this way, but it seems they might have been testing a new format for packaging. Otherwise this packaging is wonderfully done, and even features the poster art for each of the movies behind their respective discs.

""Hey, Doc! Where you goin' now? Back to the future?"" ""Nope. Already been there."" - This is truly the most definitive version and packaging of the Back to the Future movies thus far. It's what I hope to expect from other box sets in the future (Jurassic Park 20th Anniversary Edition, anyone?) My one negative aspect as noted was the disc holders, but overall it's worth it. It's a wonderful time to re-watch it if you've haven't seen it in awhile and also a wonderful time to see what everyone was talking about if you are new to the series (Like I was!). The value to money ratio is definitely for the benefit of the buyer, and what the buyer gets is a piece of cinematic history with the perfect format and presentation that one could ever want with a box set of movies.",1303689600,4,7004,4.505114083398898
3428527,5,B00198X0UO,"Wow, just, wow. These films are classics for all time, and Universal did them right by giving them a fantastic Blu Ray Transfer. The colors are crisp, the darks are dark, and the detail is superb. This Blu Ray disc set not only has a fantastic transfer and audio quality, but the Special Features are fantastic. Basically what you get are most of the features that were all ready available, plus some new HD documentaries and featurettes.

The movies themselves are fantastically creative, and are amongst some of the best Sci-Fi films made in the last 40 years. The story revolves around a crazy scientist named Doc Brown who creates a Time Machine, and accidentally sends his partner, Marty McFly back in time to the 1950's, where he accidentally stops his parents from ever falling in love. This premise is original, hilarious, and tense, and the movies, all 3, feel like crazy roller coaster rides. Definitely recommended.",1302048000,5,926,4.898089171974522

3428535,5,B00198X0UO,"Back the Future is back on Blu Ray (this review is for the 25th anniversary Trilogy on Blu ray):
Let me start by saying this is probably the best Blu Ray picture+sound quality I have seen in any 80s movie and its superior to many titles from early 90s or 2000s for that matter (I own about 100 Blu ray titles if not more and have seen plenty). It is so excellent that I think it should be considered as a measure of quality for all other productions should try to measure up to. If you didn't know anything about 80s culture, fashion or any other element that gives away the timing of the film, you could easily be convinced that it was shot just recently  (that's how crystal clear the picture is).

I am not going to review all the films in the package as I am sure if you are already here considering purchasing this product, you are well aware of the movies. Back to the Future is a wonderful, fun, entertaining movie that has become a classic over the years. After 25 years, it still holds most of its power which is not easy to do for any film. The idea of a teenager travelling back in time and meeting his parents, messing up the time continuum in the process and then trying set everything straight, back to how they are supposed to be is pretty damn interesting theme (the theme evolves further with 2nd and 3rd films). Michael J. Fox is perfectly cast for the role as well as all the other actors. I love all three movies and Amazon's price is great deal (I got it for $35 when it was on special gold box deal). Even if the first movie is your favorite, I would still recommend getting all three movies for this price.

They also did an excellent job with special features and bonus materials. Everything you would want to know about the original idea, the production, the casting, script, interviews, Q&As, behind the cameras, deleted scenes, feature commentaries (multiple) and many more are included. Overall, I would give this item 10/10 on all categories, movies, picture/sound quality and special features. If you grew up in the 80s and if you are a fan, don't even think twice about buying it. If you grew up in the 80s and vaguely remember this movie, I would recommend that you buy it- you will most likely love it and it's probably better than you remember. If you did not grow up in the 80s then I recommend that you watch these movies with an open heart and I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised.",1300579200,5,2424,4.3822222222222225

It takes the time travel theme and explores it in much greater depth than any previous film. Fox is superb as the various incarnations of the McFly family (with ground breaking effects for the time) and Christopher Lloyd plays the eccentric inventor to perfection. The time periods in the second and third film are rendered with such detail that you really become engrossed in the film and live it along with the characters. These films aren't heavy, serious movies, but they are brilliantly directed and acted and a great slice of family fun for a Sunday afternoon or just about anytime really. The extras are excellent and really add to your understanding of the whole series and are fascinating to watch in their own right.

This film series was truly before its time.  In fact, it seems that in Part II you see a cameo by a flat-screen wide aspect TV (the scene where McFly's son switches on the TV and commands it to go to like 8 channels at once).  Also, the Nikes Marty wears in Part II look a lot like the sneakers teenagers wear nowadays.  Heavy!

As for the trilogy pack, the price was great on Amazon, it included the BD DVD as well as Digital Copy for each film.

The extras will take me many hours to get through but that's a good thing.  It is chocked-full of stuff.  Other reviewers mentioned the conspicuous absence of Christopher Lloyd in the extras.  If that's so I'll likely downgrade this review later.

Other than that I was blown away watching this on my home theater system.  My wife, who had not watched these films in some time, was amazed.  She and I both agreed that they don't make movies like this anymore.",1298505600,3,1042,4.228426395939087

Well guess what, I pulled and pried and yanked every which way and the darn discs absolutely would not come off, even pulling at full strength! Short of completely ripping the case apart and smashing the plastic, there seemed no way to get the discs out! Let's just say there is a reason there are tons of Youtube videos instructing how to remove the discs from this absurd case. Even after watching them, it was still difficult to get it out, and once I did, I had the hardest time figuring out how to push the discs back into place! You certainly will never want a visitor or friend trying to watch this to remove the discs themselves as they will likely ruin the case and the discs trying to get them out.

- Absolutely incredible picture and sound. It's like watching a whole new movie: you get to see stuff you never noticed before! If you like BTTF, just buy it!
- Stuff in the Can: Some are great, some are (oddly) of very poor quality, even careless. Example: the 1880's photo of Doc and Marty by the Clock - which I would have framed, by the way - looks like a poorly made fake! It's incredible how these people went through the trouble of creating perhaps the best BR transfer yet and then fail miserably with something as simple as friggin' a picture... unbelievable.

THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM! I have seen Back To The Future (and the other parts) countless times many years ago, and have not seen it in years. Now my memory has not been affected, I do remember what the movie and the picture quality looked like. But the blu-ray TRULY brings the Back To The Future trilogy back to life -- it was as crisp and detailed like never before, and the whole experience was like seeing it in the movie theatre again for the first time!

This movie, and Avatar, definitely justified the purchase of a blu-ray player.

3428637,5,B00198X0UO,"The original Back to the Future was the biggest movie of 1985, and is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Because it deftly blends science fiction, comedy, nostalgic period piece, and suspenseful thriller all together to create a time-hopping adventure that appeals to just about anyone of any age. Michael J. Fox stars as skateboard-riding teen Marty McFly, who finds himself accidentally launched back to the year 1955 by mad scientist Doc Brown (played with wild-eyed zest by Christopher Lloyd) and his nuclear-powered time-travelling DeLorean, where Marty inadvertantly prevents his own parents, George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) from meeting and falling in love. Now faced with the most literal example of an existential crisis, Marty must play matchmaker to ensure his own birth, prevent bully Biff Tannen (Thomas Wilson) from keeping Marty's future parents apart, and with the aid of a Doc Brown thirty years younger, find a way back to 1985 before he's ""OUTATIME""! Filled with clever gags about time travel, the perils of purposefully and accidentally altering the course of history, as well as Alan Silvestri's epic score and the music of Huey Lewis & The News, Back to the Future succeeds as a one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see.

Back to the Future II picks up immediately where the original film left off. Marty and Doc zoom to the year 2015 to prevent Marty's future son from being arrested, an event that will destroy the McFly family's legacy. After a run-in with Griff (also portrayed by Wilson), Biff's part-cyborg grandson (hey, it IS the future), they succeed, but the elderly Biff discovers the time machine and swipes it in order to give his 1955 self a sports almanac that'll make him filthy rich. Marty and Doc return to 1985 and find that their hometown of Hill Valley has become a demilitarized zone, where millionaire Biff has total control. In order to turn things back to normal, our heroes must head once again to 1955 and steal the sports almanac from Biff.

Back to the Future III finds Marty stuck in 1955 once again after a lightning bolt sends Doc and the DeLorean to 1885. Marty must once again enlist the younger Doc for help getting back to his own time, uncovering the damaged DeLorean the elder Doc left stored in a cave. However, Marty discovers that the elder Doc gets shot to death by notorious outlaw Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Wilson again portrays this role) and resolves to rescue Doc from this terrible fate. Upon arriving in the Old West with the repaired DeLorean, an errant arrow from a charging tribe of Indians (or Native Americans, if you want to be P.C.) rips the DeLorean's fuel line. And since gasoline does not exist yet, Doc and Marty must not only prevent their own demise at Buford Tannen's hands, but figure out a way to power the DeLorean up to 88 MPH in order to get home.

Back to the Future II & III were filmed back-to-back, five years after the original's success, noticeable in the differences in a handful of characters (Fox's hair seems slightly different from how it appeared in Part I, the actress who plays Marty's girlfriend has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue, and Glover priced himself out of both sequels by demanding an absurd pay raise). The back-to-back sequels always felt problematic to me, as neither film feels particularly ""whole"" when watched on its own. Part II always feels a little frantic and overstuffed with action, and Part III is often left with the task of resolving the plot. Part II ends on a cliffhanger, which is disappointing since it leaves the movie feeling incomplete, and you have to watch Part II to understand how the characters get where they are in Part III, which also leaves Part III feeling incomplete. Franchises like The Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean suffered from the same problems, and I'd prefer if Hollywood abandoned this practice and opted for a ""one film at a time"" approach.

Also, some prefer Part II due to the film's faster pacing and multiple settings that include the past, alternate present, and future. Others will prefer Part III for its Western feel and slight elements of steampunk, as well as its similarities to the original film, since it also sees the main characters trapped in the past and seeking a method to return to their own era.

Though they're great films, they aren't without plot holes. Why does the successful McFly family live in the same house and in the same neighborhood as when they're poor? Why don't Marty's parents recognize him as the person who got them together? Why is Marty's brother going to work in a business suit on a Saturday? Why does Doc return from the future to get Marty in broad daylight if he's trying to keep the car a secret? It's a time machine, so couldn't Doc have chosen a more secretive moment to come back? When Old Biff returns to 2015, he fades away yet the broken top of his cane doesn't? Why doesn't 2015 Hill Valley start to transform after he returns? If younger Doc finds out that his older self gets stuck in the Old West and gets shot, why can't he take precautions to prevent this, similar to the way he does in the first film? Why does elder Doc act surprised and upset when Marty arrives in 1885 to rescue him if his younger self knows that Marty is coming to save him? After Marty arrives in 1885, why don't Marty and Doc dig up the damaged DeLorean that Doc stored in the cave only a few months prior and use its gasolene on the repaired DeLorean to get home?

Another personal gripe with the movie is the fabrication of Marty's confrontational attitude when he's called a chicken or a coward. Characters with flaws are necessary in telling interesting stories as flawless characters are boring and uninteresting, but the introduction of this character flaw feels forced since it's never addressed in the original film. The writers' intention is transparent; the chip on Marty's shoulder was put there just to generate more conflict.

Overall, the Back to the Future Trilogy is a fun time-traveling adventure spanning three films. Whatever your feelings regarding Part II & III, the original film is clearly the best of the trilogy.",1295654400,4,6183,4.762126865671642

The Things that I like:

+ The first(and well deserved) release of all three movies restored in Full HD

+ Universal's U-Control Feature featuring an awesome choice between a showing a Setups and Payoffs, Storyboard Comparisons or Trivia Track to see during the movies (more on those in a minute)

+ The pocketBlu feature which can be downloaded as an app to certain devices such as iPhone, iPod touch, Blackberry, and Android allowing those mobile devices to be used as an enhanced remote for certain movies. This can allow you to use the keyboard on your device as your keyboard for faster typing when needed and skipping to certain scenes automatically.

+Unlike some movies, the Digital Copy discs of all three movies in this set allows you to transfer a copy of the movies to iTunes so you can add them to you iPod. Meaning that if you don't have these movies on your iPod already but would like to, you get that for free automatically.

Things that could improve:

+ We wish that these movie discs had the typical pop-up menus of most Blu-Rays, but unfortunately you won't find that on these discs. Press the Disc Menu here and the movie stops, taking you back to the regular menu

+ U Control only allows one feature at a time. Meaning that you cant have both the trivia track and Setups and Payoffs come up automatically during the movie.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U Controls Features:

Setups and Payoffs: See how key scenes in the movies are Connected throughout the Trilogy

Storyboard Comparisons: Compare key scences with the original storyboards

Trivia Track: Get neat factual information while you watch the movies

The packaging is standard what you would get if you were to purchase it from costco or bestbuy or something.
It's weird how the disks are held in by the case's plastic. It's fairly brittle, and I already broke one of the little pieces off, so you must be a tad gentle. Everything plays very well.

3428712,5,B00198X0UO,"I just watched the Back to the Future Trilogy on the 25th anniversary blu-ray release, and I hadn't cracked up that much in a long, long time.

I was seven years old when the movie came out in theaters in 1985, and there are so many reasons why watching the whole triology again was so much fun.

First of all, it's just such a great film series to watch. It's just as much fun today as the first day I saw it (and then proceeded to watch again and again and again). The acting is just fabulous. The story is really character driven. Even though it's got time travel and some cool effects, it's really about the character Marty, Doc Brown, and the whole gang. The actors really make the characters come to life, but also take it a step further so that they're almost caricatures but at the same time grounded, realistic, and believable. Marty is just that typical teenage kid that any American adolescent can connect with, so you just can't help but join him on his wild and crazy adventures. Doc Brown is totally that fun crazy scientist that every kid wishes was their uncle. Biff and all his incarnations is that burly and perfectly stupid bully that everyone just loves to hate. Then there's Marty's parents, so very Mom and Dad yet so vulnerable and human at the same time. The soundtrack is just so epic and perfect. I think putting this big-sound, epic-fantasy music mixed with 80's hip style really made it feel like an adventure in your own backyard.

Next, it's just so awesome to see the 80s again. This film really captures the sensibilities of it's time, and I guess having been released in 1985, right in the smack middle of the 80s, really made it a marker, a touchstone of the times. I was in elementary school throughout the 80s, so I really felt just like a kid again watching it. The experience seeing it at 32 was oh-so-nostalgic of 3rd grade. I grew up with the generation of kids that sat in front of their tubes (not YouTube) watching G.I. Joe, Smurfs, Transformers, Rainbow Brite, and My Little Pony. Sure, it's fun to have seen Transformers and G.I. Joe in live action movies today (and I'm a little terrified of the Smurfs film coming up), especially when you go back to those cartoons today and think ""Wow, I had low standards back then"", but it's such a trip that a movie like Back To The Future is just as great to watch now as it was then. In fact, having become a writer and gotten to know the process of film making and how impossible it is to pull off a great film, I feel like I appreciate it so much more today as a masterpiece of entertainment and story-telling.

Finally, the time-travel experience is absolutely perfected for me personally by the fact that this film was shot all in Los Angeles County. I grew up during the 80's in Whittier, CA, and the external high school scenes were shot at Whittier High School. Also, the mall parking lot where Marty blasts off into the past in the suped-up DeLorean was shot at the Puente Hills Mall, my neighborhood mall in my pre-teen and teen years. Seeing the footage of the mall when Robinsons and JCPenny were still there really took me back. And I noticed the Fudruckers that had turned into a Barnes and Nobles and marveled at the fact that that same Ross store is still there! The parking lot looked almost exactly the way it looks today. 25th anniversary indeed!

It's also worth noting that in Back to the Future II, Marty, Jennifer, and Doc Brown travel 30 years into the future...to 2015. It just turned 2011. That's four years from now! OMG, I cracked up so much at what they had designed the future to look like. Flying cars? Household fusion reactors? Not after 9-11 girls and boys! I can see how it was tough to predict that the biggest change would be in computers and satellite technology and that we'd be able to access the entire developed world in the palm of our hands. But yeah, I remember when I was a kid, my parents said that by the time I drove, we'd have flying cars. Better attach those hover engines to my Honda Odyssey tomorrow.

After watching this trilogy again, I started to see some of the influence it had on my own story writing style. In my book, available in paperback&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Phoenix-Mountain/dp/0984607722/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Phoenix Mountain</a>&nbsp;and as an kindle ebook&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Phoenix-Mountain/dp/B004GEAHOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Phoenix Mountain</a>, Kyle's kind of like Marty, pulled into a crazy adventure that changes him completely forever. Ah-gong is a little like his Doc Brown, though he's not as all over the story. I wasn't thinking of these films at all when I wrote the story, but I think the way I handled Kyle as a character does have some of Marty's reactiveness in him. Thank you Michael J. Fox. ^_^

One of my greatest childhood disappointments was finding out that the hover boards didn't really exist. I really, really, really wanted one, and I when I saw the footage of the wire-work that went into creating the hover board scenes, I felt so depressed. I wanted so very much for them to be real! Gotta hand it to the special effects at the time for making me dream.

I'm so grateful to the people who put these films together and made them possible. It's such a treasure trove of good feelings, good laughs, and good times. To everyone who had a hand in making the Back to the Future films, thanks guys for all the sleepless nights and hard work! Totally enjoyed the ride!

I don't even remember seeing it in that quality EVER, since I don't think I saw it in the theater back then, but watched it on VHS then DVD.

I just don't want to damage the discs, but other than that, with some moderate care, you should have no problem...other than that, a definite gold mine!!! Enjoy!",1293840000,2,1490,4.273049645390071

3428761,5,B00198X0UO,"3 Blu-ray Discs, 3 Digital Copy Discs, released October 26, 2010

The ""Back to the Future"" trilogy of movies was directed by Robert Zemeckis and written and directed by Zemeckis with Bob Gale. It was produced by Steven Spielberg and along with the first movie inspiring a sequel split up into two movies, an animated series, and a Universal Studios ride (which can be watched as an extra in this set!).

Michael J. Fox played Marty McFly, a high schooler with a girlfriend named Jennifer played by Claudia Wells and a family that is less than successful. Marty is friends with a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd who has invented time travel with the use of a DeLorean! Marty accidentally goes back in time thirty years and runs into his future parents played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover as high schoolers and almost screws up them meeting and getting together. In the first film, he has to find a way to set things straight for history while helping his dad face a bully named Biff played by Thomas F. Wilson and get back to the future.

In the second movie, Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc go to the future to the year 2015 where there are flying cars and other weird stuff to prevent Marty and Jennifer's son from making a big mistake. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, future Marty, Marty's son, and Marty's daughter. Most other cast members returned except for Crispin Glover whose demands were too high for another film and he was recast by Jeffrey Weissman and Jennifer Parker was recast with Elisabeth Shue due to Claudia Wells having personal family problems and dropping out of acting for a while. The main conflict is that future Biff finds out about the time machine and takes a sports almanac back to his past self to become a millionaire in 1985 when Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc return to it. After facing an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" Pottersville horror scenario with Biff, Marty and the Doc go back to 1955 again to set things right.

In the third movie, Doc is accidentally sent to 1885 and Marty goes back to the old west to rescue him. He meets Irish ancestors and ends up in a showdown with Mad Dog Tannen (another incarnation of Biff because no one in the town of Hill Valley ever leaves). This one just feels like an excuse to make a fun western, but it also lets Doc Brown have a love story with Clara played by Mary Steenburgen.

This is a classic, iconic movie series. Clearly, the first movie is the best because it is the most relatable, wanting to see your parents at your age and the charming story that goes with it and how it all magically ties together. Even though the other two movies were well thought out and planned for elements to tie in, it was never quite as special. It is a little more forced and the subplot of Marty never being able to react well to someone calling him ""chicken"" (or ""yellow"" in the third film) seemed more immature than I thought Marty was portrayed in the first film. The original ""Back to the Future"" is arguably one of the most memorable and influential movies of the last 25 years and is always a feel-good one to watch.

Bonus Features:

There are three parts of a six part series on the making of the Back to the Future trilogy. You learn soooo much about the process, casting, and what it was like with Michael J. Fox's schedule recording for television during the day and for the movies at night and getting very little sleep. It is fascinating to learn how the story came together by putting events on index cards to make sure everything tied together smoothly. There are bunches of deleted scenes that mostly gave unnecessary exposition and extra jokes that took up more time than needed.

Beyond those features are archival featurettes: On Disc One, ""The Making of Back to the Future"", Making the Trilogy: Chapter One, and ""Back to the Future"" Night where Leslie Nielsen hosts a playing of the movie on TV with interludes about how the film was made and preview footage of the sequel AND the Huey Lewis and the News ""Power of Love"" Music Video. On Disc Two, there is ""The Making of Back to the Future Part II and Making the Trilogy: Chapter Two. On Disc Three is ""The Making of Back to the Future Part III"", ""Making the Trilogy: Chapter Three"", ""The Secrets of the Back to the Future Trilogy"", the music video ""Doubleback"" by ZZ Top who appear in the film, and Back to the Future: The Ride that you can watch.

The Q&A with Michael J. Fox goes over some of the information already covered in the Making Of Series, but fills in a lot of blanks about makeup, crew, working with the car, etc. Every answer is set up with a visual zooming in and then zooming out which gets jarring when you hit ""play all"", and otherwise is a great feature on this set. For audio extras, you can listen to Q&A commentary with director/writer Robert Zemeckis and producer/writer Bob Gale on all three films. It is one session broken up into three parts, but they are not feature-length commentaries. They go more into detail about why certain actors were recast and how stories came about and situations with producers, etc. There is also feature commentary with producers Bob Gale and Neil Canton on all three films.

In the Behind the Scenes feature on Disc One, you can watch original make-up tests, outtakes, photo galleries, and watch the storyboards version of the nuclear power plant scene that was cut in favor of the watch tower story with and without producer commentary. The deleted scenes involve embellishing story to emphasize ideas we already know (Marty's dad is a loser, etc.) as well as ""showstoppers"" which stop the movie to have some jokes. On Disc Two, there are outtakes, production design, storyboarding, designing the DeLorean, designing Time Travel, a Hoverboard test, evolution of the visual effects shots, and photo galleries. On Disc Three, you can watch more outtakes, designing the town of Hill Valley, designing the campaign, and photo galleries.",1293753600,4,5947,4.617786187322611

There's little prepares you for the quality of the print on this Blu Ray reissue - it's absolutely gobsmacking. I've seen great restorations before (""Goldfinger"", ""North By Northwest"", ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", ""The African Queen"", ""The Italian Job"" - see reviews for them all) - but this is exemplary.

The full run of extras is dealt with in detail in Amazon's description above, but it's worth highlighting that among the superb new extras is Michael J Fox not afraid to show his present medical condition in the 6-part making-of that is spread across the whole set. There are contributions from almost all of the cast, Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steven Spielberg etc - and great on-set footage too. It's also been pitched at a reasonable price. In short, this is properly good value for money for 3 hugely entertaining films that don't seem to have dated at all.

I can only add to the chorus of approval for this - a fantastic presentation.

Onwards and upwards to the ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Star Wars"" Trilogies and the remaining Bond films - which were all Lowry Digital Restorations and look as awesome as this...",1293667200,3,1210,4.77511961722488

But the true test was my son's reaction on Christmas morning.  He was overjoyed at finally owning the entire movie series.  The gift was especially nice because it was attractively packaged as a set. The DVD's contain plenty of extras, too.

The only big negative I have is the advertising. It's REALLY annoying to have to skip through internet enabled trailers literally every time you pop one of the three BluRay discs in and even more annoying that an trailer pops up during the digital transfer. I know this is an issue with many other movies, but it seems like Universal product is the worst when it comes to this stuff.

Also, ""Making of the Trilogy: Chapter Two"" on disc 2 is exactly the same as ""Making of the Trilogy: Chapter One"" on disc 1. Haven't checked to see if ""Chapter Three"" has a similar error. I'm not sure if this is just an issue with my copy or a bigger production problem, but please comment if you've found the same mistake on your copy!

You shouldn't have to slide or pop discs out of hard plastic tabs like that just to get them out. The biggest problem is about an hour and 40 minutes into the first movie, when Doc shows Marty the bullet proof vest, this Bluray crashes a lot of players for some reason. I thought it was a defective disc, so I exchanged the set and the second set did it too. Then I come on here and see others had the same problem too. It's not like I have a crappy Bluray player either, I have a less than year old 400 dollar Sony. This is the only Bluray I've had a problem with.

First off - The set is amazing!  If you like these movies, you should just buy it... Now!

Now for the instructional part of this message:
Several people are complaining about how difficult it is to remove the discs from the packaging.  They say that they feel like they are going to break the discs while trying to pry them out... Well, the problem is that you are getting in too much of a hurry and you are not examining the packaging.  I've bought several Blu-ray sets that have the discs stored like this.  It's probably the new thing.  It's really simple to get the discs out if you just do it properly.

Instead of having the little plastic hub to snap the disc onto (which discs often fall off of during shipping and they get damaged as they slide around in the case), now you have a more secure method.  Two springy plasic pieces rest on the bottom edge of the disc, while three platic tabs (two towards the top and one centered over the bottom) hold the disc securely in place.

To remove the disc, stick your finger into the hole in the center of the disc and lightly pull it towards the springy plastic pieces.  They will bend down allowing the disc to slide down and out from under the top 2 plastic tabs.  While it is in this position, you just lightly pull on the hole (that your finger is in) lifting the disc away from the case. Lift it out (carefully sliding it out from under the lower tab).

To put it back in, just do the opposite.

If done properly, the disc comes out quicker and safer than the old style cases.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I get tired of receiving box sets and finding that one or more of the discs have popped off of the hub in the case and become horribly scratched and dinked up.  Some manufacturers have tried to fix this by making the hubs so tight that you DO almost break the disc while trying to get it free.

This is a good new method of protecting the discs in box sets.",1292457600,6,2027,4.236979166666667

It's only really annoying when you have to dig out the digital copy disks when you transfer them to your computer, and that is something you'll only have to do once. The movie disks themselves are really not that bad to remove repeatedly.

As for the movies, the Blu-Ray versions of the movies look gorgeous, and the extra features are great resource for BTTF fans. The glimpses of the Eric Stoltz footage is a fun addition, and there is a hilarious outtake for the first movie that really makes this new set worth it.

My only real complaint is that the image quality on the iTunes digital copies could be better. Even though the resolution is 853x460 the picture looks pretty soft if you watch it on anything larger than an iPhone screen.",1292284800,2,882,4.472049689440993

In the extra bonus very nice interviews and anecdotes.

Regarding the package at the beginning was a little bit of a challenge to try to take the disc out of the case.  I thought that was a very bad idea to do that style of disc case/holder but latter I learned how to do it.  It should come with an explanation of how to take the disc out of the box without scratching the disc.
Basically you have to push the disc from one corner towards the other lower corner.  If you see the box has in the bottom part a system of clips that recoils when pushing the disc.  Well, once you learn how to do it you will see that it is actually easier and better than the other traditional disc containers.",1291852800,3,905,4.288235294117647

However, if you have the patience, I'd recommend waiting to see if Universal releases the trilogy in a new case.  As others have mentioned, the packaging really is among the worst out there.  Why, after over a decade of perfectly suitable varities, would Universal decide on this one?  I've never seen or used a case as absurd as this one.  I don't mean to whine but any case that has to include instructions on how to insert and remove the discs clearly needs a redesign.

3428957,5,B00198X0UO,"I really love this Trilogy Pack of the Film's of "" Back To The Future, 1, 2 & 3 "".  In fact, I have this Trilogy in both Formats, Regular & Blue-Ray DVD Formats; As good as the Regular one
{ 1 } is, in my own Opinion, I would have to say that the Blue-Ray Version is by far 100 % Better ALL Around.  It is 100 % Better in Audio & Visual, Color & Print Quality, Everything is 100 % Clearer & Sharper; in my own Opinion, you Can't get any of this from a Regular Formatted DVD, ONLY on / with Blue-Ray, in my Own Opinion.  It is because of ALL of these Super Fantastic Improvements that I'd prefer Blue Ray OVER the Regular DVD Version / Format.
  All the Manufacturers need to do now is to come up with a Multi Disk Blue-Ray DVD Player that can hold up to a Maximum of Six { 6 } Blue-Ray Diskette / DVDs, and they will make the Consumer Extremely Happy; when the 1st Blue-Ray Disk is finished, the Guy / Girl WON'T Have to Continue Opening & Closing the Machine to changing the Blue-Ray Diskette; instead, all he / she has to do is Advance the Machine to the Next Blue-Ray Diskette up until ALL Six { 6 } have been Viewed / Watched / Seen, then they ONLY have to go Opening & Closing the Compartment Draw for the Blue-Ray DVD's ONLY Once instead of Several Times Over.
  I have a Bran New { Replacement } Multi Diskette { Six / 6 } DVD Player { Regular DVD Player,  NOT  BLUE-RAY  }and I love that Version Type 100 % Better over the Single DVD Player's; besides with a Single Diskette DVD Player, { Regular OR Blue-Ray } by continuously Opening & Closing the Compartment Draw, that will cause the DVD Player to Wear Out Alot FASTER.  But with a Multi Disk Player, there's Alot Less wear & Tear on the machine when it comes to the Opening & Closing, which means it will Last Longer; and by lasting longer, it means LESS Money being Spent to Replace that machine, which means more money in the Consumer's Pocket for Spending on things that Need to be Spent on; For EXAMPLE:  Life Insurance, Medical Insurance, Auto & OR Home Insurance, Clothes, Food, Electric Bill's, Cable & OR Telephone Bill's, Repairs & Maintenance for the Home Steed and or for a individual's Own Vehicle, Laundry & Laundry Supplies, and so on.  These are just a few of the things that people Require / Need Money for.  What are they going to do, where is the money going to come from for Paying for such things, if thy have to continue going out & buying / purchasing another Regular & OR Blue-Ray Player?  As one knows money Doesn't Grow on Tree's, and the Creditor's come around, those people better come with the money, or there going to be in BIG Trouble with the Law.  You Can't have say $500.00 to your name, take that money, Spend it on Food, and then take Exact Same $500.00 Dollars and spend it in other area's.  If you Spend that $500.00 on Grocery Shopping, and the Monthly Telephone Bill, you Can't Spend that same $500.00 on other things for the reason because you won't have it because you would have already Spent it.
  So in the end, in my own Opinion, I would have to say that for the money, Over the Long Hall, it's Alot Cheaper as well much better for the DVD Player to have a Multi { Six / 6 } Diskette Player instead of s Single DVD Diskett Player, in my Own Opinion.",1290816000,3,3256,4.197431781701445

The audio and video are wonderful on this set, and I am overall very pleased with it.  The packaging isn't anything fancy, and for an anniversary edition, I expected a little bit more.  It's OK, I suppose.

One of the great surprises for me was on the disc for the 3rd movie.  One of the extras is all of the line video from the Back to the Future Ride that used to be at Universal Studios (recently replaced by The Simpsons Ride).  What I mean by ""line video"" is the full video that you would see on the various monitors while you waited in line for the ride.  Beyond that, the disc actually has the full ride video as well!

I like the concept and the discs themselves is not bad. I would have given it 5 stars but I'm giving it a 4 because of the casing in which they come. There is an outer cover made of cardboard (seems very cheap) and you cannot hold it without having the discs slide down from it all the time. Also the way the discs are held together is very weird.

These three films defined my childhood, so needless to say, I was ecstatic to receive my blu ray copy in the mail when it was first released. The good news is that the quality of the transfer to HD is excellent. Piercing colors, wonderful resolution, near-perfect sound... and from an old 80's movie no less! The new documentary series about the making of the film was pretty good (not amazing). As with every making-of, the story of making the first film was by far the most interesting. The featurettes about the second and third film was somewhat dull.

I was also disappointed at some of the extras. For one, they had all of the legacy featurettes from the original DVD collection, WHICH I ALREADY OWN! Not a fan of rehashes. Secondly, I really really really wanted to see full scenes featuring Eric Stolz (the original Marty McFly). But I was saddened to find that there was in total, about 20 seconds of the footage, and its buried deep in the new documentaries.

It was fun to see some of the odd promotion videos for the franchise, especially the Back to the Future ride! I really got a kick out of that.

All in all, I highly highly highly recommend this new release for all fans.

Discs 2 and 3 or not actually wide screen. I was told Universal will replace the discs for customers early next year.
(That was a bit disappointing)

However, the real thing sadly lacking in this set, was the much hyped footage of Eric Stoltz as the original Marty McFly.
Basically, the small snippet that was released to the press about a month ago, is all there is.
I really think Universal duped the public on this one. I am not exactly sure why, with 5 weeks of footage, they
couldn't release a lot more. It would have been fantastic to have a scene-by-scene comparison between Stoltz and Fox.
This was a huge selling point for a lot of people (myself included).

I am guessing (hoping) this is coming out in a later version of the movie (How many versions am I going to have to buy!).
Either that, or they didn't want to pay Eric Stoltz any money for using more than a certain amount of footage (?).

I am rating this higher than I would normally only because the movies are so damn good, but beware.",1289174400,3,1210,4.4125560538116595

But the problem is, if you're not careful, you could ruin this entire DVD set within a short period of time. Universal should be ashamed. And maybe they do this because they think if you ruin the set, you'll buy it again? I really don't know. But I've came to the point where I don't want to keep the discs in the case anymore. Removing, putting it back in the case, it doesn't matter, I always felt I was going to scratch or ruin the disc. There are two springs at the bottom of the case where the disc sets, you put pressure down on these springs, then you're supposed to press down in the middle of the disc and it's supposed to come out. First off, there was no instructions. I actually had to go on Google and youtube to find out how to properly do it. Even by watching, it's still a pain, and I still have serious issues putting the disc back in the case. I think I scratched the first disc by the defective casing. I don't blame Amazon at all, but I probably will be returning this. If you're scared about taking the disc out, you can check out youtube for help, but even with proper instruction, it still seems overly problematic and this should not be like this.

I personally don't like it, I actually broke the mechanism that holds Part 1 before I figured it out.

Basically, you just need to push the disc down so it bends the two plastic ""arms"". Then you can lift it out. I broke it by actually using my fingers to push them down, and they snapped fairly easily. Luckily blu-rays are very scratch resistant so it's not really an issue.

Also, a fun fact for those out there. This comes with a coupon code for TellTale Game's Back to the Future game. You get episode 1 for free. Was definitely a pleasant surprise for me when I saw this :)",1289001600,5,756,4.5036496350364965

3429058,5,B00198X0UO,"I come here to read reviews and find out about the special features, picture quality and sound.  I want to know if this is a set worth buying when I already have the original DVD set.  All I get are reviews after reviews talking about how bad the packaging is.  Are you kidding me?  Do I care about a jewel case?  How about a review on the movie and digital tranfer to blu ray.  Give me a break people!!!!!  Get a life!  That is why half the reviews on products I take with a grain of salt.  All people want to do is complain and pick on the little things.  How about a positive attitude and review the contents of this product.... not the packaging.

Some people say they are returning their set hoping to send a message to the studio about the packaging.  Come on folks!

I am about to buy this set of blurays.  I am thrilled they exist in the format I want to see them in.  Right now that is all I care about.  I don't care about a less than perfect package.  I wouldn't even care if there were spelling errors all over the package.  All I care about is the quality of the contents!  I hope it is worth buying... but I guess I will never find that answer here!

Here is the bottom line (especially for those that say I am wrong).  If you don't like the package then return the movies and get your money back.  I will sit in front of my wide screen TV and watch them in bluray... the best picture quality available.... you can sit home and keep complaining while you watch them on a junk DVD player.

3429100,1,B00198X0UO,"First off, the movies are great. That's not why I'm writing this review. Universal utterly failed in the design of the packaging for this set. It has to be the worst blu-ray box set I've ever encountered and I own hundreds of movies. First off, the slip case slides off way too easily. It's only a matter of time before it gets dropped. Second, the discs are incredibly difficult to remove. I don't know who designed this or why, but what I'm really curious about is how he managed to smuggle it out of the madhouse he's being housed in. Seriously, this case was probably rejected as a means of torture because it was deemed more inhumane than water boarding. Finally, the discs are stacked. I hate when discs are stacked in cases, and the frustration is only compounded by the problem described above.

I am returning this set for a refund in the hopes that Universal will come to their senses and quickly pull these from shelves in favor of a replacement set. Otherwise, I guess I'll be waiting until these movies get individual blu-ray releases. I might miss out on the extra features, but it will be a small price to pay. Seriously, don't encourage Universal by getting this set. Don't do it.",1288569600,8,1196,4.562790697674418
3429101,5,B00198X0UO,"Ok, I got this thing figured out ;-)

There are two sets of clips for each blu ray -- a bottom set that moves, and then a right and left fixed set.

It's actually very easy -- here we go.

1. Pull the disc downwards by inserting your index finger in the center hole of the disc.

2. Beneath each disc is a set of plastic retaining clips -- you will see the clips give a bit as you're pulling the disc down

3. After activating the clips, you can now gently lift the disc out.

4. To return the disc back to its holder, simply place the disc back by tucking it under the right fixed clip, pull down on the disc to activate the bottom clips, then you can gently pop the left side of the disc under the left fixed clip.

Try this a few times, and let me know how it goes. Hope you found this helpful. My discs remained scratch free.

3429102,5,B00198X0UO,"Universal didn't mess this release up like they did with the original BTTF DVD release - all films look great and are in the correct widescreen format. There's not much else to say about this set. It's Back To The Future. On Blu-ray. With new special features. If you're a fan, buy this.

The ONE HUGE FLAW with this product is the awful case design. I'm sure I'm not alone in this - the discs are held in place by a very tight labyrinth of plastics, and removing a disc always gives me a small feeling of fear as if I'm going to crack one of them. Getting them back in is a chore as well, as you have to pretty much force one side of the disc down into place over one of the plastic bits. That, or you could go the bending route... neither of which are very safe.

All in all, great product. The films look better than ever and they sound better than ever. I suggest however that (if you're willing) you use an alternative storage solution for the discs. It won't be long until we start seeing a mass of reports of discs being scratched/cracked.",1288483200,,1046,4.225

Also picture quality on these blur ays will blow you out the water, bttf has never ever looked this good, don't listen to those losers who stick their face to their tv to look for imperfections.",1288483200,5,638,4.406779661016949
3429104,5,B00198X0UO,"The films:

Definitely one of the most fun film series of the 1980s and early 90s, BTTF really shines. The writing is quite clever when compared to other big-budget tentpole flicks. The ties between the three movies are a lot of fun to notice. Although part 1 is definitely the best of the three, parts 2 and 3 do not drop off too much in quality. Michael J. Fox delivers a good performance, definitely in keeping with the 1980s ""slacker antihero"" archetype. Christopher Lloyd is also quite good as Doc Brown.

Part 2 is a lot of fun, naturally, because it gives us a future as envisioned in the late 1980s. But its second half, which returns to 1955, is perhaps even more clever than the first movie's portrayal, because of how it works to show the same scenes from different angles and points of view.

Part 3 is tonally quite different than the first two, and a good portion of its emotional investment hinges on Doc Brown's romance with Clara, played by Mary Steenburgen. Their on-screen chemistry is not exactly incendiary, and thus their segments drag a bit.

Serious sci-fi fanatics will find inconsistencies to nit-pick. I certainly noticed some. The portrayal of timeline changes and potential paradoxes are rather mind-boggling, and one gets the impression that the writers resolved to not try *too* hard to create a consistent methodology for the changes. The overall moral to the story is a bit cliche (don't succumb to peer pressure), whereas a deeper ethical investigation of time travel (seems pretty nasty to relegate Biff and his progeny to second-class citizen status merely in order to boost your own family's fortunes) might have been more interesting. But you'll be having so much fun a long the way, that deeper questions such as these tend only to occur a bit later.

Any way you slice it, these movies are fun enough to keep the younger set intrigued, and smart enough to satisfy a more mature audience.

The Blu-Ray:

Let me get this out of the way - this packaging stinks. Definitely among the worst box set packaging I've seen. We get six discs packaged in a tri-fold cardboard digipak with no hubs - the discs are held in, on top of each other, by one of the most irritating pieces of plastic ever - you cannot lift these out, you must press and slide the discs in order to avoid bending them precariously against the hard plastic rim of the digipak. Unbelievably dumb. Add to that a totally superfluous cardboard case, which only repeats the box copy contained within, and doesn't even hold the innards secure when lifting. A complete and utter failure, on all counts. I wish companies wouldn't keep trying to reinvent the wheel with these sets. Just put some hubbed ""pages"" on a hinge, for crying out loud.

Anyway, the 1080p, 1.85:1 film transfers are nice, especially when considering the era in which these movies were filmed. Compared to films of a similar vintage (such as Star Trek 2-4, Goodfellas, and Batman), these transfers show a good amount of detail and not a terrible amount of noise reduction and edge enhancement (see: Predator). If grain was aggressively reduced on these films, it is not noticeable. They are a definite upgrade over DVD-quality material. The video will not blow you away when compared to a newly-minted transfer of a 2009 or 2010 film. But let's compare apples to apples - these are really good transfers of 80s material. The DTS-HD sound also does a good job, with decent separation of channels, clear dialogue, and some decent bass.

The extras are good, with commentaries, several new HD making-of and interview features, and plenty of legacy SD features from previous releases. I do wish we could have had Fox's retrospective interview condensed into one feature instead of split into a dozen snippets per disc. Also featured are the apparently obligatory (and utterly wasteful in my book) digital copies for those of you who wish to watch these movies on a 2-inch screen in the car. Yawn.

Conclusion:

Despite the overpoweringly dumb packaging, this set is a definite recommendation. It is a good set of family films (there is some mild swearing, but very little sex or violence) that will entertain both kids and adults. The a/v quality is more than acceptable for a high definition release of 1980s films. The extras are comprehensive and entertaining. The price point on Amazon is quite sound for a catalog release.

In short, if you like these movies at all, this is a very good buy.",1288483200,12,4458,4.782834850455137
3429105,5,B00198X0UO,"Let me address the packaging first...it is a new design and takes a bit of getting used to like all new things...but it holds the discs more securely than the old spindle design...the trick is to figure out the removal and replacement process...which any reasonable human of say 12 or older with an IQ above...well let's use 70 as a median...can master in a few minutes.  In my opinion the packaging isn't any cheaper than all the new releases of today the only fly in most peoples ointment is the new design.

As for the movies they hold up wonderfully and the transfer is pristine in Picture and Sound.  It is a huge step up from the regular DVDs and how many times can you say that about a Blu-Ray release these days!  My grandkids were seeing them for the first time and they went wild.  (I have to admit I couldn't believe the darn DeLorean still looked good!)

So If you're sitting on the fence on this one...take my word for it...it's worth the upgrade...and don't worry about the packaging.

Update:  To address the comment.  This is precisely what I'm talking about, even he admits he figured it out, destroying the packaging in the process.  Admittedly he may have a point about the studio springing a new design on an unsuspecting sea of consumers but that doesn't invalidate the fact that it took me 5 minutes to figure it out....but as the Bard once said, ""your results may vary...""...and ultimately ""Caveat emptor""...",1288396800,9,1431,4.620553359683795

3429107,3,B00198X0UO,"This review has very little to do with the quality of the films.  Without question, the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy is the greatest film trilogy ever made.  If you disagree, it is not because you have a different opinion; it is because you are wrong.  As far as the discs themselves go, they are top-notch as well.  It is easy to see that much time and effort went into making each film's presentation as amazing as humanly possible.  The extras are also of high quality.  What makes this package unworthy is the casing the discs are housed in.  On the plus side of things, I highly doubt it is possible to pick up a single copy of this set and there be a single disc loose.  However, there is a reason for this.  It is as if the casing were engineered to keep the discs from ever leaving, even when its owner wished to re-experience the 1.21 gigawatts of awesome each film contains.  If you are not careful, YOU WILL BREAK A DISC.  I have successfully removed my discs from their sad prison without damage, but I fear not many will be so lucky.  Again, the discs themselves are wonderful.  The casing is, simply put, manure.  And I hate manure.",1288310400,8,1146,4.369668246445498

3429140,5,B00198X0UO,"This review is about 2010 Back to the Future Trilogy on SD. When it first announced a lot of us were wondering if we should get this set or not. Of course the decision is entirely up to you
Most of you reading this have seen all 3 Back to the Future movies - so I will not talk about the stories. I have written about them in previous reviews. Overall as a general statement I love the entire series of Back to the Future - even though the first one is the best one - at least to me. Its a science fiction, action adventure , comedy & family film with time traveling to the past & future, where the cast sees themselves & families in all different time periods. The characters are all wonderful - they give me the same feeling the original Star Wars trilogy gives me. The characters are immortal , no one else could play these same characters. I wouldn't want it.
Now about this set - the packaging is similar to the original box set trilogy. When you open it you will see SEVEN discs. They are the 3 films, 3 digital copies and an extra disc that is full of new supplements.
The supplements have been ported over from previous editions and there are several new features such as a Michael J Fox interview , etc.
Point # 1 - if you love the movies & what's on this set like I do - you might want to get it for all the extra bonus materials
The discs are placed in a way that I don't mind - The movies discs are firmly placed on top of the digital copy discs.. you basically open/unfold the set and there are all the discs. It is just like the Alien Quadrilogy or the Rhino MST3K DVD sets
Now why I like this particular set up is because I don't need the digital copies so all I have to do is pop off the top disc which is the film.
Point # 2 - if you have no issues with the discs and how they're placed - plus there are 7 discs in this set - this set is for you
It is cost effective at the moment - it is on sale on websites & I'm sure stores have it on sale too.. Seven discs for a sale price of 30-35.00 to me is a bargain which leads too
Point # 3 - it is affordable when you think about what you're getting for the sale price. At the moment the cost to upgrade isn't too steep..
The last thing is that the transfers - be it Blu-Ray or SD - these are slightly cleaner than the previous release (not by much)
So after all Ive said - is it worth getting this new trilogy ? I think so - if you're a serious Back to the Future fan Id really get it - just like me..it seems like an upgrade with all the new features & for some the digital copies might be of interest.
If you're a casual fan - and are satisfied with the features from the previous separate DVD releases I would at least consider this new set. I cant see it being upgraded yet again with another release (but you can never tell).
Now that we have gotten so much deserved ultimate editions of blockbusters Id like to see studios invest in movies that have not seen the light of day on DVD -",1288224000,8,2953,3.973063973063973

But, the reason I am writing this review is because of what happened after I paused the movie for a while, and the screen saver kicked in.  I came back and hit ""Pause"" again, and a message popped up saying that was not allowed.  The same thing with the ""Play"" button.  I had to restart the movie from the beginning.",1288224000,2,435,4.0
3429142,5,B00198X0UO,"Positive things first...The picture on these disks is phenomenal. Universal did an amazing job moving this to HD video. The sound is also great in 5.1 HD. We watched all three of the movies tonight because it made us feel like kids again. The Delete Scenes on the disk are also fun to watch. They actually add a ton of context to the movie. (e.g. why George was late to school, What was supposed to happen, etc...) The digital copies are also working fine on OSX and Windows 7 so far. I have yet to try them out on my Zune HD or IPod Touch.

Negatives: The packaging they used is horrible. The disks just fall out of the sleeve when you open the book. Why could they have used the ultra-slim cases that held 6 DVD?

Put the edge of your finger in the center of the disks hub and gently push down.  You will see some clips at the bottom flex and the disk rather easily swings out from the top with a little downward and ""pull gently toward you"" movement.  Same with putting it back in.

Just about all of the extras from previous DVD releases are carried over, some newly mastered in HD. There is a new series of nicely done documentaries for all 3 films, also in HD. Overall there are hours of quality extras for each film, both vintage and newly created. My only complaint is that I would like to have seen more footage of Eric Stoltz as Marty. They filmed with him for 5 weeks, it would have been nice to see more than the 30 seconds that are on the disc.

I have to add my voice to the complaints about the packaging. It is very frustrating and non-intuitive. It took me several minutes to extract each disc until I finally figured out how to remove them correctly. Universal should have included instructions, because it is not obvious. I think they are going to end up with a lot of complaints and returns due to broken packaging and scratched discs. Don't they have a QA department that tests these things??

Overall I highly recommend the set because of the beautifully redone HD transfers and wealth of extras. Just read up on how to remove the discs and save yourself some frustration.",1288137600,5,1506,4.425992779783393
3429147,2,B00198X0UO,Its amazing to have Back to the future trilogy finally properly done and remastered onto bluray. This is phenomonal picture and sound. Ive noticed alot more than i used to on the dvd. The one major complaint i have about this blu ray which really upsets me is not about the movie at all but rather the packaging. Its HORRIFIC it took me almost 10 minutes to try and get the darn disc out without breaking it and even then i got scuff marks each time i pulled it out. Its the worst packaging from any company of any dvd and blu ray i have ever seen!!! You have to push the disc down slip it out of these two clips on the sides and lift it out. Its simple once you get used to it after like days of figuring it out but i cant even imagine the damage its going to do to the discs themselves after constant use even after like half a year. I already got scuff marks just trying to take it out the few times i took it out. I complained to universal which sent me a diagram of how to properly pull the disc out. I suggest if any of you experience this problem as well complain to universal like i did. After they get enough complaints hopefully theyll change it. Just search universal blu ray on a search engine to find the site if your going to complain which i recommend if you experience this problem.,1288137600,7,1298,4.1141732283464565
3429148,5,B00198X0UO,"The blurays quality themselves is nothing short of fantastic.  However the packaging is one of the worst packaging choices I've ever seen.  After struggling for a bit while trying to avoid creating potential scatches the method I came up with to remove them is to first remove the digital copies.  Thats right, they are actually easier to remove. The top part should easily lift under the little clips holding it in place, then just slide it out from under the bluray disc.  Now for the top disks what I found as a trick was to push gently foward on the disc from the center of it until you are safely able to lift the bottom edge up over the  plastic holding it in place. Then slide it towards you and it should come out.  Needless to say these blurays have already been transferred into separate jewel cases.  There's no way I'm putting them back into the packaging!  It still gets 5 stars for being the greatest trilogy of all time!",1288137600,5,935,4.458823529411765
3429169,5,B00198X0UO,"Being a kid who grew up in the late '80s-early '90s, Back to the Future always took my imagination to so many places. It's always been one of my favorite franchises, and now the wife loves it as well. As a high def aficionado, of course I was going to pick this up! And what can I say? It is outstanding! The picture quality is as good as the negatives for these films will allow. I was able to hear a great improvement in audio as well. And as a previous owner of the trilogy on DVD, it is great to see all of those bonus features added in and many more! I also finally get to own the films not only in HD, but also in their correct ratio.

But what really compelled me to write this review was the packaging. Every single review I read (and the set has only been out for a day) keeps whining on how terrible the packaging is. Which was really strange to me, because when I first opened up my set and saw it, I though, ""wow, that's a really neat way to hold the discs--it contains the packaging's need to touch your disc to a bare minimum!"" Which was a problem I always had with multi-disc sets--one way or another, they could scuff or scratch the discs against each other. But this way, they're practically being held four tiny bits of plastic around the edges, and nothing touching your disc on the reading side. Maybe I'm a strange person, but when I first saw it and saw the design, I saw the little spring-like throngs at the bottom and figured, ""oh, these are holding the discs up. So you push down, and out comes the disc."" Which is what I've been doing and I have had no trouble taking out or putting back the discs. So, thumbs up. I love this set, and the packaging.",1288137600,4,1676,4.172839506172839

3429172,5,B00198X0UO,"First off, I put in 5 stars so you could read this without too much difficulty finding. BTTF looks amazing in its complete restoration, with the stunning quality that a blu ray could offer. So when I upwrapped this sucker, I fired up the blu ray player and opened the box.

I wanted my fix of Doc Brown and Marty McFly.

Problem 1: WTF is this packaging? Blu Rays held in place by clips with the digital copies behind them. When it comes to movies in general I tend to take care of my things. But BTTF, well, I baby this Trilogy. So now I open this box and pray that I can figure out the correct method in freeing the Blu Ray from its clip without breaking a chunk of the side off of the Blu Ray in the process. I want to protect my investment, how come they couldn't do something like the old trilogy on DVD that I purchased when they first went to DVD? Why do I have to play a game of russian roulette with discs I just spent over 50 bucks for? Honestly? And taking the discs out was the first challenge, putting them back in was fun too. I didn't expect this epic fail of packaging.

BUY SOME NICE REPLACEMENT CASES for your Blu Rays so you don't have to store them in this case. Ugh.

Problem 2: After the product was unpackaged, it really was easy to hold the jacket of the Blu Ray, wrapped around the case with the actual discs of the movie and have the inside case slide out of the bottom of the jacket. I didn't bother to think about this situation before it happened to me. Im sure someone else out there has already done this as well. Thank god when this happened, it bounced off of a soft matress of a bed I was viewing this movie from. But if it was to fall down onto a hardwood floor or a hard tile floor, who knows how well the packaging could hold up. Just goes back to wondering....WTF is up with this packaging?

Problem 3: Extras were a little shaky. Most of the extras were recycled from the DVD set when it first was released as a trilogy. The digital copies were a huge plus, but if you are a die hard fan of this trilogy, im sure many were expecting the Eric Stoltz footage (since there was 5 weeks of it, as explained in the online ""teaser for the BTTF blu ray edition"" that came out a week and a half ago.). Unless I completely missed it (which I skimmed through all of the extras from the 3 discs) I kinda wanted to see the BTTF with whatever they had with Stoltz in it, just because it would be a completely different look at a movie that I have enjoyed hundreds of times before. It would've been interesting to see that kind of stuff. But nope, not there. Thats kinda sad considering we are celebrating a 25th anniversary edition digitally restored with digital copies and as many extras they could pack in.

If I have overlooked it, please correct me if im wrong.

Problem 4: I was expecting some more stuff in this special edition set. Like maybe a little model DeLorean that opens up to store your Blu Rays or maybe a sports almanac or something. The Dark Knight got this treatment; the little Batman mask to open up with the blu ray discs inside. Maybe paying a little more money to get that extra bonus, it wouldve been a nice little treat. Im sure you could figure out other things they couldve done with this Blu Ray set. It seems a little bare for a 25th anniversary edition in the United States to come with NOTHING else.

Of course the quality and the restoration of the Trilogy brings it up to todays standards. Looks very pretty in Hi-def. Although I have seen these movies many many many times, the clear picture really made this purchase shine. It is still an awesome pickup if you love this franchise, but it still felt kind of lame that there couldn't been some more packaged with this.",1288137600,8,3729,4.24225352112676
3429173,4,B00198X0UO,"The movies are amazing!  Finally available in High Definition!  The colors are superb, and the clarity is excellent.  As you've all heard the packaging is terrible.  That is no joke.  There is even a website with a video of how to insert and remove the discs. [...]25th-anniversary-trilogy  After watching the video I felt confident I could handle it, and as soon as I picked up the set I removed one of the discs only to have one of the small plastic ""arms"" break off.  It still holds the disc fine, but my biggest concern is that the discs will eventually be scratched due to this type of holder.  Why they couldn't use the standard plastic ""button"" is beyond me.  I hope they change this soon.  When will they realize we'll pay 3 bucks more for packaging that doesn't fall apart or damage the discs.",1288051200,4,802,4.506944444444445
3429174,3,B00198X0UO,"While the actual films themselves look stunning on blu-ray, this review shall address the packaging.  Seriously, if I would have known in advance that Universal was releasing this collection in such disgustingly ridiculous packaging, I would have held out for the single disc releases.  I tend to go for packaged collections so this one seemed to be a no-brainer.  I literally sat and stared at the disc trays for a good 2 or 3 minutes studying them, waiting on that ""ohhhh I get it"" moment, and the discs would just come out of the trays with no problem. Boy was I wrong.  I seriously thought I was doing something wrong.  The trays do not have the standard hubs we are all used to.  The discs are held in place with these ridiculous plastic clips across the bottom and you literally have to pull the disc to one side while simultaneously bending the tray so the disc will pop out. Every time I open the box I start to get even more angry because I know what I'm in for and it takes tooooooo darn long to get the discs out.  It is THE biggest pain in the a$$.  On top of the disc trays being ludicrous, the overall packaging, slipcase, etc. looks and feels cheap. TOTAL FAIL on the packaging.  I will more than likely post my set on eBay. Universal should slap the fools that ok'd the packaging for this release.  SSSSSTUUUPID!!!!!

UPDATE:  While the packaging reigns supreme as one of the stupidest design choices ever, I did find out the proper way to remove the discs.  ""Simply"" press the disc down, letting the clips at the bottom bend, and pull up and the disc comes out.  Thanks Universal for including instructions on how to remove your discs from the packaging.  Oh, and I did notice that one of the clips is completely broken off and shaking around inside the tray.  Again, brilliant package design.  FANTASTIC!!

Getting the discs out is a major headache and leaves them VERY prone to scratching or even breaking. There is no standard push button -- you need to kinda forcibly push down on them and slide them. Getting them back in is even worse. If you buy this, there's a good chance you're throwing your money down the drain as you'll likely end up with scratched or broken discs sooner or later.

The movies, by all accounts, look great. But what's the point if the discs get damaged trying to watch them? They should have packaged them in one standard 6 disc case or three regular 2 disc cases (one per movie + digital copy disc).

The UK version does NOT have these packaging problems.",1288051200,17,829,4.411764705882353
3429176,3,B00198X0UO,"BEWARE if you purchase this set on Blu-ray.

Universal decided to use some strange packaging that rather than use center hubs, uses little plastic clips to hold the edge of the disc in place.

This means to remove the disc you kind of have to flex the entire package tray to get the disc out; if you try and grab the disc and pull, you're likely to break off the edge of your disc due to the little clips that extend over the top of the disc surface.

I've no idea why Universal went with this horrible package, but if I were you if you order this, save yourself some trouble and add this to your cart as well:

3429178,3,B00198X0UO,"This is a tough to review.  The movies are classics, they're beautifully remastered for the new format and there's plenty of great extras here.  But there's stuff to be desired. The set has all of the extras the DVD Trilogy set had, plus some more great stuff like the now defunct ride footage.  But the biggest problem I have with this set is that the packaging leaves much to be desired when you compare it to the sleek, elegant, and clean look of the DVD's box.  Plastered with colorful artwork and stuff it just looks, well, corny. It's also bulky with the flip-open cover on the outer box and the flimsy inner plastic cases leave much to be desired in the quality department.  Then you try and to remove the discs.  You know how with most disc removal you slightly press on the inner circle and lift the disc out by its edges?  Not the case here. Here you... Well, I'm not sure what you're SUPPOSED to do but I ended up just having to, slightly, bend the disc to get it out of its berth; the discs are in three double-layered plastic cases. (The BD itself and the ""digital copy"" DVD on the lower tray.)  Probably the best idea here is to remove the discs and swap them out with the DVDs in the older set. You get a nicer, more elegant, box with easier to use disc holders to boot.  Put the DVDs with their ROM counterparts in the BD case and store it, leaving the BDs in the old DVD case.

And then there's the BIG issue. No. Swag. Not a big deal until you do a Google search for ""Back to the Future BlueRay"" and ""collectors edition"" or ""Region 2"" or something along the lines and see what Britons and people in Europe get. A box filled with goodies like reproductions of the news papers seen in the trilogy, lenticular photos, and a mini sports almanac.  With all due respect, it's a bit silly that an American made movie, American actors (yes, Fox is Canadian) and released in America gets a bare-bones set like this to comparatively loaded UK Swag-filled R2 box.

3429202,5,B00198X0UO,"Got the BD yesterday. Surprisingly, one of the major electronics chains had only three copies, and a local grocery/department store had none. Weird.

If all you want to know is whether the BD transfer is terrific, and worth the money, the answer is yes. Rush right out in a buying frenzy! For those wanting more detail, there is semi-bad news and good news. The semi-bad first.

I'd hoped Zemeckis and Spielberg would have fixed the occasionally less-than-perfect special effects. For example, in part 1 when the DeLorean carries Einstein into the future, there's an obvious blue-screen ""nimbus"" around the visual blast, and Doc and Marty stand ""on top of"" the fire tracks, rather than the ground. These have /not/ been fixed, nor does it appear that /any/ of the effects in any of the three films have been updated or enhanced. What happens -- as it does in many films, not just these three -- is that some effects look worse than they did in the originals (you can now see that some of what seemed to be floor effects are actually travelling mattes), while others look better -- in particular, several of the VistaGlide * shots are far ""cleaner"" and less obvious than they were originally (eg, the scene in Marty's kitchen, and the two shots with Biff talking to himself at or in the car), to the point where they are no longer annoying.

The good news is this. These are absolutely knockout transfers, roughly on a par with ""CE3K"". I've seen all these films in the theater, and on LV and DVD, and there's no comparison. As with many BD releases, it's sometimes like seeing the films for the first time.

The ""Back to the Future"" films have always been ""good looking"", but the BDs show just how terrific Dean Cudney's cinematography is. These are often simply /beautiful/ films, beautiful in a way that could not be appreciated in the theater, or on SD home video. The home video version of a film can and /should/ look better than what one sees in a theater, and the ""BttF"" Blu-rays achieve this. (I felt I could see a teensy-tiny bit of edge enhancement on rare occasions -- mostly with text on signs, or bright/dark objects against dark/bright backgrounds -- but it's minor, nowhere nearly as visible as it is in ""Gladiator"" or ""Spartacus"". We also see sometimes see things we shouldn't -- the ""old-age"" makeup on the principal's and Doc's necks, which looks like dried Elmer's glue.)

The supplemental material is generally excellent, with unboring ""making of"" featurettes, and the ""deleted scenes"" sequences re-done in HD. (The ""scratched"", low-contrast versions of the deleted parts are, I think, intentional corruptions intended to keep anyone from splicing them into the director-approved versions.)

I was expecting to see at least one full scene with Eric Stoltz, but there are only a few silent moments. Contrary to rumor, Michael J Fox /was/ the original choice for Marty, but couldn't get away from ""Family Ties"". Because Zemeckis had to meet a tight deadline, or the whole project would be dropped, Eric Stoltz was signed. It's impossible to judge Stoltz's performance from the bits we see here, but it's obvious that he looks too mature, too intelligent, and too ""strange"" to play the naive, reactive Marty McFly. (It's also difficult to imagine there being any ""chemistry"" between Stoltz and Lloyd. **) Stoltz's dismissal appears to be a case, not of bad acting, but of inappropriate casting. Regardless, when Zemeckis asked Universal to let Stoltz go, and throw out five weeks of shooting, Universal agreed, and Michael J Fox wound up working two shifts a day, one on ""Family Ties"", the other on ""BttF"".

A ""practical"" warning... The box includes six disks, three of which are digital copies. The packaging is new to me. I still haven't figure out the best way of removing the disks. Caution is advised.

As for the movies themselves... ""Back to the Future"" is one of the most-entertaining and satisfying movies ever made; few ""Golden Age"" movies are of such quality. (The Errol Flynn ""Robin Hood"" comes to mind.) It's therefore remarkable that Zemeckis and Gale had the guts to make part II such a dark and disturbing film. (Steven Spielberg says as much in the supplemental material.) Most people don't like it -- and don't even ""get"" it -- so I'd like to briefly discuss what is arguably the best film of the series.

An essential element of drama is /choice/ -- a character has to make a decision that will affect him and/or others. In part II, Marty decides to use time travel to get rich. The consequences of this go beyond personal disaster -- his community and family are destroyed, and other people have their lives ruined. This plays out as a perverse inversion of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", as Marty sees what his selfish choice has lead to.

The plotting partly follows ""The Hero's Journey"" -- the monomyth that appears, in various forms, in many cultures. Marty has to go through figurative Hell to set things right and redeem himself, coming back a better person. The next time you watch part II, think of it as the dark middle act of a three-act play -- which it is.

* I think I've figured out how VistaGlide worked. It was a computer controlled VistaVision camera with dynamically positionable matte boxes. (ZZZZZZ...)

** It's worth noting that when Doc and Marty ""hug goodbye"" at the end, it's a serious, affecting moment, rather than being played for a cheap homophobic laugh. One of the pleasing things about these films is seeing the way Doc's initially coarse, self-centered personality improves.",1286928000,8,5536,4.815789473684211

I purchase a lot of DVDs, and depend on accurate information in my selections and decisions on purchases.
