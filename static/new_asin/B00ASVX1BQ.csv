5508176,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"""ACT 1"" is already released over here  in Europe & on Amazon UK in all formats. Its advance promo gave promise of an unforgettable spectacular, and that's exactly what Tarja, her band and ""back-line"" crew have delivered here. As you can see from the set list , she had so many strong tracks to capture -from her first 2 studio albums plus a third now in the works- that the 2hrs 45 of concert footage is actually from 2 concerts over consecutive nights in the same theatre ,with partly varying set lists.

Live concert videos really just don't come any better than this. Tarja's choice of the venerable Teatro El Circulo( Rosario, Argentina)is a truely inspired one, with its stack of five packed out ""dress circles"" towering up to the surreal giant ""eye"" of the circular ceiling that got the theatre its name. Add a laser-light show that fits perfectly with every number,hire a camera team who really know their craft (and DONT try to ""upstage"" with  editing-deck gimmickry)and it all feels about as close as it gets to ""being there"" - short of actually being there, of course !

You just may have seen a promo clip saying ""Act 1"" is ""One Hundred Percent Live "".Tarja explains in her Blog this just means the sound was not ""enhanced"" afterwards- what they played is what you hear. It was not intended to come across as ""all you hear was played live on the night"".So don't expect any extra  orchestra/choir joining Tarja's normal touring band on stage. Even so, the only ""non live"" elements that were obvious to  me were some ""heavenly choirs"" in two or three  of the set list - and I'm sure these  work far better this way than having an actual choir standing around on stage with nothing to do 90% of the time!

It's  the size and adaptability of Tarja's band that enables ""Act 1"" to be as near an all-live performance as it is .To drums, base and keyboards she adds cello and no less than three lead guitars - one also doubles as a second solid base where needed, similarly her keys man doubles as ""second cello"". Now and then,  Tarja herself pitches in on grand piano and keys. It all cranks up to be not just one of the heaviest metal ""attacks"" on tour anywhere, but also a band probably more able than any other to reproduce  the classic/ symphonic elements of any studio album live on stage.

One ""quirk"" on first play might amuse- just after half way through DVD 1,Tarja introduces In For A Kill as ""our last song for tonight"",then there is another last song  & encore from the second night at the end of DVD 1, followed by a final ten more numbers on DVD2. This actually all works very well for the DVD format- though IF the single Blu Ray disk sticks to the exact same running order, that might not feel quite so right there.

""Extras"" on DVD2 mostly features a decent length session Tarja of answering a range of questions ,and in a way that  sheds some new light on (her own words) ""the person behind the artist"".

The sound and visual quality in the DVD format I opted for is superb. Hopefully the same will also go for the Blu-Ray this time around-one review did report issues with that format of the previous ""Tarja & Harus"" video, like ""Act 1"" here an Ear Music Release)

""Act 1 "" will be one hard act to follow,but it also leaves you both hoping and expecting that ,in time, Tarja will indeed do exactly that. A clear ""must-have"" for all Tarja fans, plus anyone else with an ear for innovative heavy music without boundaries.

(The Full Setlist for 2-DVD option is down in the Editorial Review in the Product Info.  As of today the Info indicates it is only a single DVD, this must be an Amazon typo as there is in fact no single DVD variant either on release , or planned. Only the Blu-Ray is a single disk. Most but not all numbers are also in the 2-CD pack, only available separately from the Video formats)",1346630400,20,3827,4.44

5508188,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"this blu ray was really badass. tarja turunen is one of my favorite metal/rock/classical singers. i was really happy with the setlist and the performances that she and the band brings. i had a great time watching the show and just imagining that i was there too, i was even singing along as i was watching it. the sound was really good too for live stuff. i cannot wait for another live blu ray/dvd to come out.",1399507200,,411,4.35064935064935
5508189,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"the whole package was nice. loved the concert and extra footage.
i would  recommend it to any fan of former nightwish or anyone that likes good music and an amazing singer",1397347200,,171,4.516129032258065
5508190,3,B00ASVX1BQ,"Too mellow compared to earlier DVD's with nightwish.  Lost a lot of carisma after leaving the band.  I really wanted to like this, but in the end it is only ""ok"" to me.  Many, many people really love it, but I miss the rest of the Nightwish band and their uptempo playing.  The songwriting does not seem to be as good either.",1396310400,,325,4.193548387096774
5508191,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"We all know the sordid business Nightwish had done to Tarja; in fact, whilst watching the ""End of an Era"" DVD, you get to see the whole band (who ALL had signed that VERY hurtful letter, by the way) being chummy with her, smiling at her, and interacting with her onstage as if they didn't know what was happening as soon as that final concert in Finland was done: that after delivering a flawless and passionate performance (which showed!), she was going to be fired anyway.  They wouldn't tell her she was being fired for obvious reasons: their DVD would have captured a less than stellar performance.
This is VINDICATION!  Nightwish had hired Annette Olzon after firing Tarja, and although acclaimed by many, Annette, to me, wasn't Nightwish material.  Floor Janssen, however, fits the shoe perfectly, but I digress... THIS show was the shot in the arm Tarja NEEDED, especially after that rotten letter.  BOTH DVDs were spectacular, but it was the second DVD that cinched it; especially attracted to her during her Nightwish era, to me the second disc captures that lost spirit WITHOUT having to suck up to Life because she had gotten fired.
In Nightwish, Tuomas Holopainen's name is all over the credits!  He's a GENIUS composer, in my opinion, but it took Tarja's voice to breathe LIFE into Tuomas's compositions.  Here, Tarja stands tall in singing songs written by others, with others, and by herself.  You know... Tarja didn't NEED Nightwish, as far as I'm concerned?  Her magical VOICE is all she needs to pull her through... that, and the love her fans shower her with!
There is a touching moment in this DVD where she actually ventures DEEP into the crowd, accompanied only by a recording of the music of the song (and her body guards, of course), and it takes a healthy pair to actually do that!  That action transformed her into a reachable goddess to her fans.  My favorite piece, however, is the haunting ""Tired of Being Alone.""  I nearly wept because the song is so beautiful and so gut-wrenching!  It sounded as if she was pleading, bearing her soul to some invisible lover, wanting to be something she wasn't born to be, but yet, still willing to give it a go.
She has weathered much, Tarja has, and any other singer would have cocooned him or herself into an shell that can't be breached; some have taken the ultimate way out, adding yet another name to Rock's grim necrology.  It is admirable, that one so lovely, one so TALENTED as Tarja, chose to dust herself off after the Nightwish fiasco, and PROVE to THEM, that she didn't need them after all... that she had survived what many would have viewed as a career-killing move.
I've never seen her live--yet!  And I wait with bated breath the day I can actually see her perform her music live.  Yes, Nightwish shot themselves in the foot when they did that to her, but being the trouper she is, it was merely a stumbling block to BIGGER and BETTER things!",1394582400,4,2924,4.66147859922179

5508195,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"Finally, the issues have been corrected and I can enjoy this wonderful blu-ray! I may be a little biased because I was at the concerts where this was recorded, but also because of that I can tell you that this is an accurate portrait of what happened at those concerts, and it reflects very well the experience of seeing Tarja live. Two concerts were recorded, and here you can see a full concert, plus the songs that were different from the second concert, as well as an interview with Tarja and some photo galleries. The venue is gorgeous and the audience was really energetic. Tarja is a wonderful artist and I really recommend this to anyone who wants to see what her music is about.",1377129600,,687,4.504
5508196,5,B00ASVX1BQ,Excellent material completely satisfied and would recommend it for all people who like Rock Metal Simphonic. Tarja Turunen is a queen.,1375401600,,134,5.428571428571429

5508218,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"Must have for any Tarja fan ! Nightwish doesn't know their loss, Tarja commands the stage as always. Maybe for that reason Nightwish wanted to move on without her.",1371945600,,163,4.655172413793103
5508219,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"Act I is just epic! Beautiful! A masterpiece of the modern metal!

If you haven't heard Tarja's voice, I invite you to buy this album and listen her unique voice, talent and a team of excellent musicians.

What I like most of this DVD? The entire show and the warmth of latin american metalheads.

I enjoyed every song. Tarja rocks!",1371168000,,332,4.5
5508220,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"She really conveys such depth in such lovely sounds.
Nightwish did us a favor setting her free to reach her full potential.",1370649600,,123,4.636363636363637
5508221,3,B00ASVX1BQ,"I won't get into any of the tripe about who was the better Nightwish vocalist. Easier comparing peanut paste with leeks!
I have a number of her first band's DVDs, and although entertaining enough, Tarja never really looks comfortable.
At her best, great voice, but singing in English looks a struggle.
Odd that she considers herself as a lieder singer, and others say she is a lyric soprano! Renee Fleming is a lyric soprano.
Great backing band, good-looking show, but in this viewers mind, Tarja too often sings off the note. I suspect that this is really hard stuff to sing. (Tho' Sharon Den Adel gets away with the same problem on The Black symphony.)
There are some high points, and too many awful ones.
The recording quality is excellent., and the picture and filmwork very good.
For real Tarja fans only",1368662400,,809,4.704225352112676
5508222,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"Such an immaculate presentation, proves that Tarja can indeed Walk Alone and be at the top of the game at what she does. One of the best DVDs in my collection, one that will get revisited often.",1365120000,,194,4.27027027027027
5508223,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"When it comes to certain artists you always know the new material will be great as with Tarja . Weather with Nightwish, or solo always seems to please her fans.",1364515200,,160,4.366666666666666
5508224,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"Tarja has the voice of an angel. This dvd show that she really loves what she does. You can not help but smile, as you watch this. It is a great dvd. I would recommend this to all Tarja fans. She does all her popular songs. Doing them live takes them to another level. The crowd reaction is incredible. This is a fantastic dvd.",1363824000,,327,4.125
5508225,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"From start to finish is  extraordinary , you feel in a dark journey with music of the night. Tarja has done it again, lovely voice.",1362787200,,131,4.24
5508226,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"This is hours of excellent music, and at a low cost.

Not only is the music superb, nut the recording quality is very good.  If you like Tarja and her band, this is a must-have. If it were a video tape, I would have won it out already.",1361145600,,235,3.875
5508237,5,B00ASVX1BQ,This DVD is amazing!!!! TARJA does such a wonderful performance! I really recommend this DVD to any Nightwish or Tarja fan. Each cd is about 2 hrs and it has lots of songs. I bought the DVD not the Bluray and it works great! Shipping was very good too!,1361059200,,252,4.163265306122449
5508238,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"After ordering the original blu ray it was shipped late and then I had to return it as it did not work in my player.  When I say that they were releasing it again, I preordered it once more.  Of course it was delayed again but it finally came today.  I put it into my Panasonic blu ray player and it worked.  The picture and sound are great.  After 3 months I guess you can say it was worth the wait.  I'm still a little annoyed by the ordeal though.",1359936000,,450,3.9444444444444446
5508239,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"I M a big TARA fan since her Nightwish days .The footage inside the theater is great. The soundmix is very powerful. If you have a subwoofer ,you ll feel your spine shake from the bass drums.  This is a great show.",1359763200,,214,4.095238095238095
5508240,3,B00ASVX1BQ,"The blu-ray version of this concert is not defective, is just that it was recorded in PAL, which is the European format for videos.  If your blu-ray player is capable of handle both standars (NTSC and/or PAL) you're going to be able to enjoy the full concert.

This is a great concert for sure.  It is a MUST-HAVE in your collection!!

Enjoy!! (because I did!).",1357257600,,361,4.507692307692308
5508241,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"Got overexcited when ordering....bought the DVD instead of the CD, but worth it.  Will probably buy the CD later.

If you like Nightwish, you'll love to see their ex singer live!",1356912000,,178,4.709677419354839

5508243,1,B00ASVX1BQ,"I ordered the first copy and the original availability date slipped significantly. When I finally received it, I loaded into my Blu-ray player. The credits started, then everything stopped and the player reset. I returned it and Amazon sent me another copy. Same problem. Amazon gave me a full refund and said they would not sell any more until they fixed the problem. Full marks to Amazon for customer service, so one star for them. The product was a waste of time and money. I hope it was just a bad batch.",1355184000,,508,4.532608695652174
5508244,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"Quite long show but interesting! She always brings the heat, transfers the passion to the audience! The way she moves, she waves and the setlist are good! Especially the ascoutic part <3<3 So beautiful!
The high-definition videos, great audio and some bonus material are perfect to satisfy you. If you love symphonic metal, you can't miss this!
I've been a fan of her since 2007, quite late but I really grateful that I knew her! Tarja's music means a lot to me!
Every CD, DVD of her and from the previous era with Nightwish is always worth to buy!",1354924800,,548,4.545454545454546

5508246,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"This is a PAL format Blu-ray, which is the European/British format broadcast standard, as opposed to the NTSC standard in the USA.

I suspect that this disc is also a 50Hz disc, as many European/British PAL Blu-rays are, as opposed to the 60Hz discs sold and playable in the USA. SO UNLESS YOUR BLU-RAY PLAYER SUPPORTS PAL/50HZ DISCS, AND ALSO CONVERTS 50HZ TO 60HZ FOR AMERICAN TVs, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VIEW THIS BLU-RAY IN THE USA. (Unless you have a TV that supports both 50Hz and 60Hz, AND a player that plays PAL/50Hz - in that case you'd also be able to view this disc in the US.) SONY PLAY STATIONS DO NOT SUPPORT PAL BLU-RAYS. Below is a list of US Blu-ray players with PAL/50Hz capabilities.

The sound and picture is perfect as you get the highest quality sound of DTS and picture perfect quality.

It never made it to any sort of menu. Then, once I get on Amazon I find that many other people are having the same issues. I was really looking forward to this, too.",1352160000,6,506,4.571428571428571
5508271,1,B00ASVX1BQ,I was looking forward to this release but unfortunatly the Bluray discs that have been produced are defective. Many forums are discusing this and the Production company says they are working to rerelease the bluray version. When you start it up the Federal warning shows followed by some logos and a black screen that does not end. Buy the DVD version I have heard that one works.,1351987200,2,380,4.686567164179104
5508272,1,B00ASVX1BQ,"I have had 3 replacement BluRay Discs and none of them play.  They have been tried in 4 different machines and nothing.  There is a serious problem with the BluRay discs and it is on many forum sites where people cannot play the BluRay, but they can play the DVD.  This company did an awful job of quality control and have caused a lot of issues.",1351555200,12,346,4.212121212121212
5508273,1,B00ASVX1BQ,"NOTE: the low rating is due to the Blu-Ray not working, not the content.
All the current reviews (as of 10/30/12) on Amazon are for the DVD version.  Here is what I found when I purchased the Blu-ray version - hope this helps, and if others have found functioning versions of the blu-ray please let us know.  This may or may not be limited to the US version (though posts on Tarja's forums indicate it is other countries also).

I purchased the blu-ray at a local store (had pre-ordered from Amazon but got an e-mail that they are having trouble getting copies - may be due to the issues) and the blu-ray ran fine through the logos but would not play the main menu, concert, or extras.  This was on a Sony stand alone player and a PS3 - both with current firmware.  I searched online and found many others have the same issues with the blu-ray in different brand players and on laptop/computers (search Tarja Act 1 blu-ray problems online to see the posts or visit the Forums at Tarja's site).  It seems like it is a manufacturing issue with the blu-ray which causes it not to play.  Hopefully the issues are resolved in the future - till then buyer beware if you purchase the blu-ray.",1351555200,5,1185,4.433179723502304

5508276,5,B00ASVX1BQ,"""I MADE A PLEDGE AND GOT THE MEDIABOOK FROM THE OFFICIAL TARJA ACT1""This is how i have seen this already;)I have been a tarja fan since her days back with nightwish,and i felt when she went solo she was more able to do what she wanted to do Musically,and this long awaited official live concert from her shows just how strong her and her new band are,From her Vocals which sound as strong and beautiful as ever,to the amazing crunch of Alex Scholpp -Electric Guitar, Guitar and guest Julian Barrett. The bass sounds great also Kevin Chown - Bass Guitar, Backing Vocals, Ukulele Bass and Doug Wimbish - Bass Guitar, Acoustic bass guitar. Also the drums and the drum solo on this concert are really awsome you can feel the power of Mike Terrana - Drums, Djembe,and Christian Kretschmar - Keyboards, Cello also is really rocking it on this concert harder than ever;)I have seen Tarja live and several bootlegs of her live,and this performance on this dvd is truely the best i have seen from her;)She also does a few new songs she says will be on her new album:)I Highly Recommend this to all Tarja fans;)",1350172800,2,1101,4.565656565656566
