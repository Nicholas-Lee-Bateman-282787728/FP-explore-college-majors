8160963,5,B000LC4Z9Y,"I can't remember why I bought this DVD (!), and it didn't turn out to be what I was expecting. It turns out to be a movie from the late 1960s, and the cinematography and picture quality are certainly not flawless (including noticeable squiggly lines that are from the original film transfer (I'm talking about the tiny dust lines/hairs on the lens of a movie projector that you sometimes see on the screen at the movie theatre.

However, the storyline is pretty good! Given the low price I paid and the outcome of the story, I can forgive the outdated film quality.",1388361600,,565,4.53921568627451
8160964,1,B000LC4Z9Y,"Once again this company (Fusian) has put out a terrible quality DVD.  The movie itself may not be bad, but how anyone can sit through this mess is beyond me.  Despite the text on the front claiming ""Digitally Re-Mastered"", it's not.  Unless they really mean ""digitally re-mastered to look as bad as possible"".  And if you are watching on a computer moniter, forget it!  The interlaced, jagged-line effect is all over the screen and distracts from what's going on in the movie.

It' no wonder this company went out of business.",1334275200,,526,4.725274725274725

Also being this was done in 1969 the film quality leaves a little bit to be desired and jumps around during several instances in the movie.  The action is pretty decent mostly sword fighting some hand to hand combat.  A brother and sister seek out the Thunder Sword who murdered their father when they were very young.  Each going through a transformation before finally meeting up with him later on in the movie.

There are more than a few suprises as to the identity of the killer.  It left me a little suprised but pleased at the same time.  Enjoyable movie while not long has enough action in it to keep you going as long you don't give up on the movie early on.",1209340800,,798,4.308724832214765
