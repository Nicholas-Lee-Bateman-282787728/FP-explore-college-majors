3797357,5,B001U7IJYG,"The movie ""Where God Left His Shoes"" is one of the best films I have seen in recent times.  It stirred many emotions in me.  The acting is top notch by all.  John Leguizamo's character, Frank Diaz, shows the struggle and passion of a husband/stepfather, trying to struggle in these hard economic times.  I am sure many in our country can relate to all that goes through his head.  Leonor Varela plays a wife (Cleopatra) who is trying to deal with the situations of both her husband's misfortunes, and caring for her children.  You can see that dealing with both at the same time, is taking its toll on her.  Its not always obvious whether or not she truely believes in her husband.  The children, played by David Castro and Samantha Rose, show how struggling the hard times of today can be on people their ages.

You want to cry when time and time again, Frank is turned away from opportunity.  The minute things start to look up, something it off.  You feel angry when you see Frank and his family have to steal in situations (ie when he and his son jump turnstyles, and when Cleopatra clears the $ off the table where they eat).  I have no doubt that these kinds of events are true to MANY in today's world.  They're not trying to be vicious criminals.  They're trying to make it.  But the closed doors leave them no $ to even have basic everyday needs. You also feel angry at the lack of compassion by ""the system"" that is faced. Its the holidays; the season of giving.  Everybody gives Frank the cold shoulder.  Even the moments that ""look like there might be a chance"", end up having no compassion for his plight. You also feel empty about mainstream commercialism, when you see Frank and his stepson walking among the more well-off crowds and stores in Manhattan.  All the big shopping signs and the rich environment seems so frivolous with the two of them moving through it all, trying to find a simle job.  They at least find some charity when they have to resort to begging.  Again my sadness came to the surface.

In many ways Where God Left His Shoes rings similar to The Persuit of Happiness with Will Smith. He was a struggling man trying to find shelter and food for his son.  This film tends to pull at your heart and emotions just a bit harder.  Will's character eventually found open doors.  It was based on a true, incredible story.  But so many true stories out there are just like Frank Diaz as well.  You route for a happy ending when you see the old man, of Frank's job, try to find him and work something out.  This is a great example of the ""older way of doing things"" vs. todays more unflexible styles in the business world, that so many face.

Unlike Persuit, there is no clear ""happy ending"". That does not matter. I was left with 2 things.  Love, between the family members, and hope, that eventually things will work out.  Those 2 things are what really matter in today's world, whether it be at the holidays (in the film) or any time of the year.
In closing I urge everyone of any economic bracket, to see this movie.",1258588800,22,3047,4.418312387791741
3797358,5,B001U7IJYG,"Frank (Leguizamo) and Angela (Varela) and their two children are evicted from their NYC apartment and move to a homeless shelter. On Christmas Eve there is a glimmer of hope if Frank can find a job. He and his stepson set out roaming the streets to find employment.  This is a powerful and heartwarming story of a family that refuses to break apart during the darkest time of their lives, discovering that they will survive as long as they have each other. A critic says: ""John Leguizamo has never been better."" See MOVIE MANIAC listing on Amazon.com.",1246665600,4,551,4.680412371134021
3797359,5,B001U7IJYG,"It takes considerable artistic bravery and conceit to make a film such as this one, in the style in which it is put together. Although there are more than two characters in this film, it is essentially a two-hander, carried by John Leguizamo and the eleven- year-old David Castro as his stepson. It takes tremendous guts for a film-maker to entrust their creation to just two actors, especially when one of them is so young. But these two actors were perfectly cast, and my attention was held fast until the credits rolled. I watched it twice on the day that the DVD arrived. The film is an unflinching look at the life of a homeless family in New York, and it tells you all you need to know without melodrama, and still manages to remain spare, lean, and breathtaking. I have friends who have lived homeless, and this is their story. If you want to understand the homeless trap, then watch this. I waited years to buy this film. Don't make the same mistake.",1419984000,,958,4.511494252873563

3797363,4,B001U7IJYG,"I stumbled upon this little gem today. John Leguizamo plays a down and out father wonderfully. A man who will stop at nothing to provide for his family. This movie made me sad because I thought about all the people who are homeless, struggling to survive and I just felt so thankful for all my blessings. This economy has turned a lot of lives upside down and it's important to remember that life can change in an instant. When we are stripped of all our material possessions and luxuries, what are we left with? I can't believe some people are complaining about the ending, I won't say how it ended but I will say that they got across a message of what's important-hope and love. Not every movie is wrapped up in a corny little bow...This is a thought provoking and entertaining movie for a reflective person. Give it a shot.",1341792000,3,826,4.47682119205298

3797365,2,B001U7IJYG,"I loved how this film showed what it's like for some homeless families. I had a hard time with there being a lot of bad language in it though; I wish I knew when those bad words were coming so I could've plugged my ears. The title of the movie made me think there was going to be clean language, although the film case it was in had a ""not rated"" rating on it, so there was no way of knowing. I guess maybe hearing bad language doesn't bother some people when watching a film, but for me it does and I want to make others aware of it, also. The film did sharpen my senses a lot more on the topic of homelessness.",1325289600,5,612,3.943548387096774
3797366,5,B001U7IJYG,"John Leguizamo delivers a spectacular performance as a mediocre boxer who is unable to get another fight after he is so badly beaten in his previous bout.  Unfortunately, boxing is how he supports his wife and adopted son, so this NYC family is soon down and out, evicted from their apartment for non-payment of rent, into a homeless shelter and so forth, until they finally are sleeping, as a family, on a city train.  Along the way their love and faith in one another is severely tested, and the gut wrenching harsh realities of life are difficult to watch but impossible not to.  This is the antithesis of a feel good film, and it kind of leaves you hanging there, miserably dismayed, jaw droppingly sad and finally utterly somber.  That said, I feel this film is a must see for all of us who live in BS land, watching one Hollywood abomination after another, from comic book super hero junk to old TV sitcom remakes, at least this one delivers genuine creativity, not to mention a powerful punch.",1311292800,4,1000,4.601123595505618
3797367,5,B001U7IJYG,"I was up late one night and ended up watching this movie. I'm glad I did. Sadly, there are a lot of people in the world who are down on their luck, just like this family.  One thing they had was love for each other, but ""love doesn't pay the bills"" as someone once said.  This is a very good movie, a must see.",1294617600,3,310,3.828125
3797368,1,B001U7IJYG,"Save your money. This piece of New Age film craft (it has nothing to do with art) will leave you wondering why you blew your money on this. The storyline will let you down time after time - no self-responsibility, no hope, no redemption. God is mentioned only in the title line, otherwise this movie is as Darwinistic, and atheistic as it gets. Message: your poor, your without sense, there is no hope! The title is a masquerade there is nothing Christian about this Hollywood attack on belief.",1282521600,10,494,4.625
