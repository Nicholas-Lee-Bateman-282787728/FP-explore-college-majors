The sence: the I like was the bus, when him and his soon to be ex-girferind was fighting and he stopped his car right in front of the bus. Cause Mu Chan to drop her fish that she gotten from work, than she goes outside to begg him to move his car and he starts up with her and than he comes up with an idea for the car to be moved. He tricks her into getting in the car smashing the car to the bus. Love the old Ladies when they come to Mu Chan help at the police station so cute.

Love their first date by the way who bring their date to watch them play HOCKY so funny. He gets her on the Ice he kissed her with picture proof, but get his by her gardner friend that's in love with her.
She got him good by saying she also had a bet but she really didn't.

Special when he said he LOST THE BET TO HIS FRIENDS you cant tell than that he was falling for slow and hard.

But I hate these people MU CHAN aunti, and step uncle chi.
REN mother that B***** and his going to with she played him like a fool for 6 yrs.

But love the little so young and smart
