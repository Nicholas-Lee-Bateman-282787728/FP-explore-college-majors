8494624,2,B00687K6WG,"""Brand of the Devil"" qualifies as a saddle-sore horse opera about three Texas Rangers who work undercover to help a feisty female rancher survive the depredations of a gang of evil rustlers.  ""Randy Rides Alone"" director Harry L. Fraser helmed this thoroughly average horse opera from a screenplay by Elmer Clifton. If you're counting, ""Brand of the Devil"" is the fourteenth entry in the long-running PRC Texas Rangers franchise.  This horse opera unfolds with prologue: ""Dedicated to the law officers of the Old West, who led the fight for law and order in the pioneer days of the country in 1880.""  Actually, our heroes don't have a difficult time, but their chief adversary is a wily enough to delay his arrest until the movie winds up.  Texas Rangers Jim Steele, Tex Wyatt, and Panhandle Perkins ride into the town of Willow Springs.  Fraser establishes the identity of the villain early on while two of our heroes struggle to help the woman who is being plagued by rustlers.  Nothing really different occurs in ""Brand of the Devil,"" except for one scene where the villains try to frame the frontier gal for rustling by having a man masquerade as her from a distance while cattle are being rustled.

""Brand of the Devil"" opens as one of our heroes, Jim Steele (Jim Newill of ""Spook Town""), attempts to infiltrate a gang of rustlers. The cagey chieftain, well-heeled Jack Varno (I. Stanford Jolley), refuses to hire him, even after he has triumphed over an opponent in a bar room brawl.  Meanwhile, Panhandle Perkins (Guy Wilkerson of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") masquerades as ""Branding Iron"" McGee who claims that he can fashion branding irons that cannot be duplicated by rustlers. Later, angry rancher Molly Dawson (Ellen Hall) storms into the Willow Springs saloon, claims Duke Cutter (Reed Howes) has purloined her white stallion, and starts to throw liquor bottles at the bar.  Varno's henchmen close in on Molly, but Steele and Tex Wyatt (Dave O'Brien of ""Reefer Madness"") intervene on her behalf.  Molly skedaddles into the night with them.  After Molly, Jim, and Tex gallop away, Varno discovers a card with the mark of the devil's brand on it. Varno supervises a band of gunmen rustling beef in the territory.  The sight of the card bothers Varno since the devil's brand serves as the emblem of his gang.  The actual symbol is a white devil's pitchfork against a black background.  The Texas Rangers aren't advertising their official presence, but it doesn't take long for the villains to learn about them.
