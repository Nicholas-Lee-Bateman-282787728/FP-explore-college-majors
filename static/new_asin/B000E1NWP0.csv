2481386,5,B000E1NWP0,"This isn't a review as such (I love Morse - enough said), just a (hopefully) helpful tip for anyone who wants to buy this box set but finds the $425 price tag too high: provided you can play region 2/PAL discs, you can get the same entire Morse collection (in different packaging) from amazon.co.uk for under $200. Of course the shipping costs would be higher, but the total would still be a lot less than the US box set.

Hope this is of help to Morse fans in the States!",1184457600,47,472,4.2444444444444445
2481387,4,B000E1NWP0,I love Inspector Morse but I'm supremely frustrated that it has no Closed Captioning.  Why is that?,1165017600,20,99,4.823529411764706
2481388,5,B000E1NWP0,"I just finished watching all 33 episodes (each as long as a movie), and collectively they comprise the best television series of all time, in my opinion.  This excellence is attributable to a unique combination of factors--brilliant writing, the casting of an actor (John Thaw) who added great depth and complexity to the lead character, the Oxford setting (which provided rich atmosphere as well as compelling plotlines), wonderful music, talented directors, outstanding supporting actors and guest casts.  The series got better and better over the years as the characters developed individually and in their relationships with each other, and as information about their pasts was gradually revealed.  Kevin Whately, who plays Sergeant Lewis, does a remarkable job of creating a character who is, in his way, as interesting as Morse because of the way he subtly matures.  My favorite episodes are ""Dead on Time,"" ""Cherubim and Seraphim,"" and ""The Remorseful Day,"" but all of them are of high quality.  Although expensive, the collection is worth every penny.",1143849600,181,1059,5.317365269461078
2481389,5,B000E1NWP0,"This is one of my favourite series and to be able to purchase the lot all together is perfect.

The quality of the DVDs is excellent and all are presented in the original version which was on TV (so no editing!). A short documentary is also included on the disc.

Inspector Morse and Lewis are the perfect English crime fighting team - but favourite episode is still ""The Wench is Dead"" from Season 8 - but all episodes are a great way to enjoy an evening.",1141430400,39,456,4.290697674418604
2481390,5,B000E1NWP0,"I suppose it was serendipitous when I first saw Inspector Morse on PBS Mystery!. I was hooked from the beginning. There's something about John Thaw's portrayal--the sardonic, biting temperament and the unique relationship with Lewis--that make this mystery series the best I have ever seen. This series is sophisticated and rewarding. I believe the first time I encountered the word ""pedantic"" was while watching Inspector Morse (who certainly qualifies as pedantic).

I don't believe I have seen every episode, but I have seen at least half of them. Those that stand out include ""Second Time Around"", ""Promised Land"" (supposedly a Thaw favorite), ""The Day of the Devil"", ""The Way Through the Woods"", ""Death Is Now My Neighbour"", and of course the melancholy finale, ""The Remorseful Day"".

$350 is a considerable sum. One has to wonder if it's worth it to rewatch mysteries. But as I said, there's nothing better than Inspector Morse, so I believe an investment in DVDs is in my future.",1137715200,78,986,5.042944785276074

2481427,5,B000E1NWP0,"I was just moving to Oxford when Morse first began to air, so the scenes are familiar to me. I am still at a loss as to how that man can get from, say, The Radcliffe Infirmary to the Meadows in seconds. It used to take us at least 20 minutes. They also closed our Local for 24 hours. That was evil. Anyway, Morse is the anti-hero of all time. Colin Dexter, who created the character, was not dissimilar, hanging around the pubs of Jericho. John Thaw (who sadly died many years back) played the character well, from start to the sad demise.

We have yet to get through this set (It is the used region 2 from the UK, Cheaper, uncut & easily playable on a region free machine, oddly, from Amazon), as we only manage two episodes per week. They are the length of feature films. You can imagine how long 33 episodes and two specials will take, but we are trying. Looking through reviews, prior to buying this set I was amazed at some comments, for example, Morse is unprofessional by being fond of a woman? Well, just look at who directed that episode & consider everything else that person has done. It becomes clear then. Less easy to comprehend is the complaint he drinks too much. No, in most of the world you do go to a pub after work or even during it, to collect your thoughts. Certainly in the UK you would. So too much Classical Music & alcohol? Well, only one country ever had the Volstead Act although, for those pining for the days, many countries live under Sharia Law. As to music, each to their own & it is the Opera etc which makes Morse the character he is. I do not think that is a secret.

For full reviews, there is a great one on these pages which covers all the episodes, which I reckon anyone ought to read if considering this purchase. The guy clearly spent some time on it & I am grateful to him. For our part, the item arrived in a week & is great. We are pleased with the series though after all these years, I think I am missing Oxford a little. Such is life.",1480982400,4,1982,4.213157894736842

2481473,1,B000E1NWP0,"All the plots are excellent and Kevin Whately portrays a capable and likable Lewis. But the way John Thaw portrays Inspector Morse defies logic. The guy comes across as a teenager in heat--no female will escape a late-night visit to recheck questions already asked, widows are offered a friendly drink at the nearest pub, right after the funeral. And I lost count of the alcohol consumed by the guy, mostly during working hours. Little wonder the writers and producers decided to end the series as they did, a doddering old drunk, drowning in a lifetime of bad habits and loose morals. Compared to other English crime series, such as Foyle's War, this leaves a lot to be desired.
  This is my second review on this series, and, after viewing the last two episodes of season 4, I must confirm my previous review. Take, for example, episode three, 'Driven to Distraction' wherein Morse sets his sights on a suspect and hounds him relentlessly throughout the segment,  revealing his identity to the victim's boyfriend, who nearly kills the poor sap, only to discover the identity of the real killer, and, without hesitation, confront him while driving at breakneck speed down a water-soaked driving range. In episode four, 'Mason Mysteries', Morse,a member of a choir where a female is stabbed to death, rushes to her aid, and, in a fit of grief, hugs the blood-stained-body to his heaving chest, grabs the bloody knife by the handle, and is thus found by the other members of the choir. Wow!  This guy is some sleuth!!

It is every bit as well written as the first  as well written as all of Handlers novels and that tells you a great deal why he is an Edgar Award winner and a Derringer, Anthony and Dilys Award finalist. For fans of well written, fast passed works of mystery David Handler is simply one of the best. I recommend Mr. Handlers work to everyone who enjoys the genre.

2481477,5,B000E1NWP0,"I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis in Masterpiece Mystery: Inspector Lewis also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting. This Region 2 DVD set contains all 33 of the Morse episodes:

The Dead of Jericho
In this first episode in what would become a long-running series, Chief Inspector Morse falls for one of the singers in a local choir (of which Morse is also a member). Her name is Anna Stevely (played by Gemma Jones who first impressed me in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess-of-Duke-Street-Episode-1-1/dp/B000KBEEDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess of Duke Street Episode #1.1</a>) and she lives alone, making a living as a piano teacher. Morse tries to gently court her, but he senses something is not quite right, not that this puts him off. Well, the romance is short-lived as Anna is found dead, hanging in her kitchen. Is the death suicide, or is it murder?

Morse applies himself diligently to figuring out who Anna really was, and makes some startling discoveries. Anna used to be married and had a child; she also had an affair with her superior at a company she used to work for; there's a rather eccentric student of Anna's who appears to have stolen money from her; there's the peeping tom sleazy neighbor; etc. In what would become trademark Morse, viewers are left trying to figure out who the perpetrator is, and this is never easy as the list of suspects is usually long, and there are red herrings aplenty.

The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn
From the opening scenes of The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn, viewers are in for a wonderful viewing experience in one of my favorite Morse episodes. Nicholas Quinn is a hard of hearing (almost deaf) examiner working for the Oxford Examinations Syndicate. At the beginning of the show, he is shown desperately attempting to fix his hearing aid in order to participate in conversations at a party. Unknown to some, he is also taking lip-reading lessons, which enables him to figure out what certain people at the party are saying. This involves the selling of highly classified examination papers.

Well, not surprisingly, Nicholas Quinn turns up dead, murdered via cyanide poisoning. Inspector Morse and DS Lewis get involved in this case, and Morse's love of crosswords plays an important role in this case. He discovers a fellow crossword lover amongst one of the men working at the examinations syndicate (portrayed brilliantly by Philip Gough), a fact that delights Morse no end, until this person too turns up dead!

Then there's a little romance sub-plot (Morse and his women!) involving a lady working at the syndicate. Morse is attracted by her beauty and intellect, but he also suspects she is keeping something important from him, and works to puzzle this out. But will it be too late? This is vintage Morse which can be viewed several times over!

Service of All the Dead
This is the third episode in the Morse series, and is quite a convoluted plot. It is also rather interesting in that the body count is rather alarming - six dead, five murdered! A church warden is found murdered, the setting being a serene country church. As Morse and Lewis investigate, Morse finds himself drawn to one of the potential suspects, a rather enigmatic woman who also happens to help out with cleaning duties at the church. Morse tries his hardest to get close to her, but finds his attention being gently rebuffed, though there is clearly some chemistry between the two.

This episode is rather intense in that Morse's personal feelings are very much involved; he gets so close that his very life is threatened at one point; and, as a point of interest, viewers discover that Morse is afraid of heights!

The Wolvercote Tongue
In The Wolvercote Tongue, an American tourist is found dead while resting in her hotel room. Though her death is initially ruled as the result of a coronary attack, Morse is convinced that something must have brought about her death, especially since the dead woman was about to present a prized jewel called The Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. When another body turns up soon after, Morse is convinced all is not right, and sets about solving the murder mystery with his long suffering detective sergeant, Lewis.
Last Seen Wearing
This is one of my favorite Morse mysteries. In Last Seen Wearing, a teenage student at an elite prep school has been missing for the past several months. The case finally lands in Morse's lap, and he confidently tells Lewis that the girl is dead. Lewis refuses to accept this, and eventually Morse gets on board and the duo start investigating. Everything points to the girl's school, and the list of suspects is long. The headmaster appears to be hiding something; the deputy head (a woman with lesbian tendencies) seems to know something but refuses to divulge any information; the male French teacher has upped and left, transferring to another school; and then there's the girl's stepfather, a powerful businessman who may or may not have something to hide.

The Settling of the Sun
The Settling of the Sun is another Morse episode that I felt was underwhelming for several reasons. It is one of the bleakest of the Morse episodes, lacking some of usual wit and humor in other episodes, and centers around a conspiracy, dating back to the war years and its repercussions.

Morse is invited to present a prize for a crossword competition organized for a group of international students. When one of the students is found murdered, Morse's investigations reveal a darker motive that goes back to the war years (the dead student is a Japanese).

Usually, the supporting cast in the Morse episodes do an excellent job, but not so in this particular episode. I found some of the acting over the top, and some less than credible. Aside from that, Morse falls for a lady professor here, but unlike the women in other Morse episodes (beautiful, charming, witty, and intelligent), this lady appeared high-strung, whiny, had mood swings, and was generally a very unappealing character. This made it difficult to understand or even believe Morse's attraction to her.

Last Bus to Woodstock
In Last Bus to Woodstock, DCI Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) investigate the mysterious death of a young girl, Sylvia Cain, who was working as a secretary at an insurance company. The investigation gets more complicated when Morse discovers that the deceased hitchhiked the night of her death; that her body was found by a young man who was actually waiting for her at a nearby pub that very night; and that an envelope addressed to another woman was found in Sylvia's possession, containing a letter written in code.

This is a well-plotted story with many fascinating clues and details that enable viewers to puzzle out the mystery alongside Morse and Lewis. With the help of an astute old woman who happened to be one of the last people to see Sylvia alive that night, Morse and Lewis piece together what happened to Sylvia Cain, with an incredibly amazing conclusion that is also altogether plausible. I am an ardent fan of the Insp. Morse series, where the stories convincingly portray the baser emotions that propel people to commit unimaginable acts against others.

Ghost in the Machine
Well, this episode really had me riveted. Some valuable erotic paintings belonging to the Hanbury family has gone missing from their stately home, presumably stolen. Then the discovery is made that Sir Julius Hanbury himself is missing, turning up dead in the family crypt. Morse and Lewis find themselves stumped by the case, as it appears Sir Julius may have killed himself, or is this really the case? Morse digs deeper, finding out some startling revelations about the lady of the manor who may be hiding some secrets.

Last Enemy
In Last Enemy, Insp. Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) investigate the identity of a decapitated body found in a canal. Meanwhile, Morse gets called in to investigate the apparent disappearance of an Oxford don. The man who calls him in is an old college rival of Morse's who is now a Master at Oxford, and it becomes very apparent that Morse can barely stomach the man who is full of airs and graces and extremely arrogant.

As the story progresses, Morse and Lewis unravel a web of intrigue involving an attractive young graduate student; rivalry amongst the Oxford dons (a recurring theme in many Morse episodes); and even body parts on a kitchen chopping block! As customary in the Morse episodes, viewers get treated to a story centering on human compulsions, notably greed and ambition that lead to homicide. Highly recommended for fans of superior British crime procedurals.

Deceived by Flight
Deceived by Flight is not one of Morse's best episodes, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The Clarets XI old boys' cricket team gather in Oxford for the annual cricket match, but the murder of one of the team members throws everything into disarray. Enter Inspector Morse (John Thaw) who knowing his DS, Lewis (Kevin Whately) is quite a cricket player himself, puts Lewis to work, going undercover as the newest member of the team!

This interesting turn makes this story quite refreshing, and though I'm not a cricket fan, I could not help but smile as I watched Lewis have fun, for once showing off his skills, and relishing every moment in the spotlight!

The Secret of Bay 5B
The Secret of Bay 5B contains an interesting plot involving the murder of an architect who also happens to be quite a lothario. As Morse and Lewis dig deeper, they discover that the architect's liaisons might yield clues to his killer's identity. This episode is also fun in that we see some erm, interesting developments between Morse and the attractive pathologist, Dr. Grayling Russell (who is obviously too young for Morse, but what the heck).

Infernal Serpent
In Infernal Serpent, Morse (John Thaw) finds himself dealing with corruption of all forms in high places. Both Morse and Lewis (Kevin Whately) are warned off the case when their investigations ruffle the feathers of some high-ranking people. Luckily, both Morse and Lewis are not averse to carrying on their investigations on the sly, and the deeper they dig, the more disturbing the details that emerge.

The supporting roles are credibly cast here - there's the Oxford master and his wife, a seemingly benign couple with some dark secrets; their daughter who seems emotionally fragile; the young family friend who comes over for a visit but seems to harbor an agenda of her own; and, a young child whose innocence is forever lost. This is another winner in the Morse series. It is slow-going at times, but Morse and Lewis' investigative methods are always meticulous and though the outcome is not quite what either would have expected, let's just say justice is served in the end.

The Sins of the Fathers
In  almost every Morse episode, the crime committed is caused by baser human instincts be it sex, money, or greed, among others. A murder at a brewery sees Morse investigating the circumstances of a family-owned brewery which has fallen on hard times. Just as Morse feels he has a suspect in hand, another murder is committed followed by one more! Viewers get treated to watching a family unravel bit by bit - surprisingly it is not the deaths of loved ones that affect some of these family members but the horrifying prospect of having their dismal family finances made known to the public. Morse digs deep as he is determined to solve the murders and there is a nice little twist in this plot which made it even more engaging.

Driven to Distraction
This is a thought-provoking episode, well more so than some of the other Morse episodes. When three women turn up murdered, Morse and his team try to find a clue that links all three, and discover that all three women had bought cars from the same auto dealer. Morse lets his own prejudices against the auto dealer affect his judgment and this costs him when Superintendent Strange pulls him off the case. Even Lewis refuses to go along with Morse. This episode reveals the flaws in Morse as a man and as an investigator and is quite a sobering episode.

Masonic Mysteries
""Masonic Mysteries"" is an unusual episode in the Inspector Morse series as Morse (brilliantly portrayed by John Thaw) is the one that is the hunted and persecuted. While rehearsing for an amateur theatrical production of The Magic Flute, Chief Inspector Morse's lady friend Beryl Newsome (played by Kevin Whately's aka DS Lewis' real-life wife, Madelaine Newton) is found stabbed to death. Her body is found by Morse himself, and soon Morse becomes the chief suspect in the case.

DS Lewis who is now assigned to assist another Chief Inspector, finds himself struggling to help Morse even as evidence points to Morse as the killer. Soon enough though, it becomes apparent that Morse is being set up by a criminal Morse helped put away years ago, a criminal so attuned to Morse's every move, familiar with Morse's favorite haunts, passions, etc. that Morse finds his life a living hell, exactly what the criminal wants.

Second Time Around
In ""Second Time Around"", a retired senior police officer is found murdered, possibly linked to the fact that the victim was about to publish his memoirs. One significant chapter appears to be missing, regarding a cold case involving the murder of a young child many years ago. Could the deceased's murder and the cold case be linked, and were both killings done by the same person? Morse struggles to puzzle the case out, and his life is made more complicated by the involvement of another senior officer and former rival, Chief Insp Dawson. Things are also not helped by DS Lewis, whose second guessing of Morse's theories rile the methodical Morse.

The story flowed seamlessly, which is a trademark of this series (although there have been clunkers). I was literally holding my breath at certain key points of the story, waiting to see if Morse's theory would pan out, and if so, in which direction. I could watch this episode over and over again!

Fat Chance
The plot is ludicrous here - on the one hand, there's a suspicious death of a female deacon destined for great things (she dies in the midst of sitting an important examination). Morse and Lewis soon discover an undercurrent of Oxford politics between the clerics who approve of change in the form of a female chaplain (would be a first for one of the colleges), and those who are vehemently against it. This plot arc also sees Morse getting attracted to a female cleric, Emma.

The second story arc is what jumbles the plot - there's a young woman under the care of Emma who appears to know something about the death and has gone missing. She is shown throughout the story, running around, grabbing people, and shouting like a crazy woman. These outbursts are tenuously linked to a pharmaceutical company manufacturing slimming pills. At this point, I no longer cared what happened to these secondary characters, and the only reason I watched it till the end was because of Morse. Even the romance bit did not seem altogether credible, and frankly Morse appeared bored throughout the story. I'd give this a miss as there are other, highly superior Morse episodes than this drivel.

Who Killed Harry Field?
This episode will interest those who are keen on art history, though I admit I felt a little underwhelmed by the resolution. When the body of an artist named Harry Field is found, Morse and Lewis are assigned the case. They find the artist's studio to be a mess with slashed paintings. Field's wife has not seen him in a week and later Morse and Lewis discover that Field may have been involved in some underhanded dealings involving forging famous paintings. The list of suspects soon grows and Morse and Lewis dig deep to solve the case.

Greeks Bearing Gifts
This is an episode that requires the viewer to pay careful attention as the plot is convoluted with two murders and plenty of suspects. First a Greek chef turns up murdered, and then later his unwed sister, who has a toddler, also turns up dead, seemingly by the same means. As the list of suspects mounts, Morse puts his nose to the grindstone to try and unravel the tangled web of this case.

Promised Land
Hmmm...this was not one of my favorites of the Morse episodes, primarily because I hated the change in setting. I love the Oxford setting and having become rather fond of it, I was none too pleased by the change to Australia. Here, Morse and Lewis pack up (reluctantly on Lewis' part) and head to Australia on a case. Being the opera buff that he is, Morse has purchased tickets to Der Rosenkavalier at the Sydney Opera House. There's scenic footage of the attractions but the plot itself is too convoluted and I found myself a rather disengaged viewer.

Dead on Time
This is another stellar episode in the Inspector Morse series of crime dramas. In Dead on Time, Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) get called in to an apparent suicide. The dead man, Henry Fallon, turns out to be the crippled husband of Susan Fallon (Joanna David) who was the love of Morse's life at one point in time. Just as the detectives wrap up the case and the coroner's inquiry turns in a verdict of suicide, Henry Fallon's physician, Dr. John Marriatt calls them in and voices his suspicion that the death may not be due to suicide at all, given Fallon's physical limitations.

The detectives then turn on to the obvious suspect, Fallon's son-in-law, who had been in debt to Fallon. But is it really as simple as that? Things get complicated by Morse's obvious partiality to Susan, and it becomes evident to Lewis that Morse is letting his feelings for Susan affect his thinking and handling of the case. This episode tugged at my heart particularly because Morse shows his true feelings for a woman here. Susan is still very much the love of Morse's life, and even though he clearly wishes for them to be together, things are not so simple on Susan's part, and her feelings are a bit more ambivalent. It is rather sad to watch Morse get thwarted in love, especially knowing what a good man he is and deserving of happiness. This is a rather bleak episode in the series but makes for an engaging watch nevertheless.

Happy Families
Morse and Lewis investigate the murder of the scion of one of England's prominent business families. Morse finds it odd that the dead man's relatives appear to be so unaffected about his death let alone horrified at his murder. Several other murders follow but this does not put off Morse in the least bit, in fact his trademark tenacity pays off when he is able to find the pivotal connection between the victims. Though not one of my favorite Morse episodes it does improve upon subsequent viewings.

The Death of the Self
I would give the actual story four stars, but it gets another star for the lovely ambience and sights in Italy. This particular episode was shot on-location in Italy, and sees Chief Inspector Morse and DS Lewis traveling there to investigate a case where a woman was found crucified to a tree. Though her death was ruled an accident, her husband's emotional outburst at the inquest makes it appear there was more to her death than previously thought. The case becomes even more interesting when Morse discovers that the dead woman had been attending a psychotherapy course in Vincenza, a course conducted by a con man (played credibly by Michael Kitchen) who had been previously arrested by Morse, been found guilty, and imprisoned for some time. Needless to say, Morse is convinced that this con man is involved in the woman's death.

Meanwhile, Lewis is initially reluctant to enjoy the splendors of Italy, worried he might not make it back home in time to see his son's sports performance. Morse on the other hand, is enjoying himself, and his love for the opera is further enhanced by his involvement with a beautiful woman who used to be a prominent opera star, and who is now attempting a comeback. Aside from the complex plot, the scenic sights in Italy enhance the viewing experience, making this an engaging episode.

Absolute Conviction
This episode is set in a minimum security prison where prisoners are afforded special treatment not found in other prisons. When a prisoner dies under suspicious circumstances, Morse and Lewis go behind bars literally to investigate. Not one of my favorite episodes because I could not care less about the secondary characters but Morse makes it special nevertheless.

Cherubim and Seraphim
Frankly, this is not one of my favorite Morse episodes. It is slow and drags on, yet worth watching for several reasons.

First, this is one of the rare episodes that provides viewers with an insight into Morse's early life. At the beginning of the episode, we see Morse and two women who later turn out to be related to him. We learn that Morse's parents were divorced when he was young, and that he went to live with his father at the age of fifteen, and had to put up with an indifferent stepmother who hated him, and still does. We also learn some other shocking aspects about Morse's early life, facts which he reveals to DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) over a pint. This episode also shows viewers how truly close Morse and Lewis are, and how much Morse trusts Lewis as evidenced in his private revelations.

Second, this episode shows viewers the lifestyle of troubled teens of the 80s - how disconnected some of them are from their parents; their interest in alternative music (in one scene, Morse is horrified when he discovers classical music has been distorted in a fusion of old and new); their secret gatherings in secluded locations, listening to underground bands and such; and teen suicide.

Deadly Slumber

Deadly Slumber is a skillfully-plotted crime story involving the murder of a renowned doctor, who together with his wife, runs a famous clinic. At first, the doctor's death appears to be suicide, but soon enough, the post-mortem reveals that the doctor was murdered. There are several suspects, the most prominent being rich businessman Michael Steppings (Brian Cox) whose young daughter Avril suffered permanent brain damage (and is on life support) since a surgical procedure gone wrong at the doctor's clinic several years ago. As Morse investigates, a curious bond of sorts develops between the two men - investigator and suspect, as Morse develops a respect for Steppings' devotion to his daughter, and Steppings in turn admires Morse's tenacity and devotion to his job. But there are also other suspects, the victim's son who did not get along with his father, and the victim's own wife, who might have known of her husband's affair with a nurse.

Could this be a revenge plot or is there more to it than that? There are several red herrings in the plot which makes it an incredibly engaging viewing experience as one tries to puzzle out who could be the murderer. I truly enjoyed this episode, and it is on my list of Top Ten Morse episodes.

The Day of the Devil
In The Day of the Devil, the Oxford police are in an uproar when a convicted serial rapist, John Barrie, escapes from prison. Chief Inspector Morse comes under pressure from his commanding officer to ensure Barrie is captured as soon as possible. This however proves to be a Herculean task as Barrie is a master of disguise and in possession of a sharp mind. He also seems to be in possession of a car and a place to live, which leads Morse and Lewis to suspect he has some assistance. The question is, who?

As the investigative team of Morse and Lewis comb the countryside, unearthing clues in pursuit of Barrie, a housewife is abducted and later released, unharmed, by Barrie. This leads Morse to wonder at the change in Barrie's modus operandi, and not only that, Barrie seems obsessed in getting in touch with Dr. Esther Martin, who was Barrie's psychiatrist in prison. Meanwhile, Barrie's interest in the occult also leads to an investigation of the local Satanist cult in Oxford, since a day revered by Satanists is fast approaching. Morse and Lewis scramble to figure out the links in the case before someone gets seriously hurt.

There is suspense and tension throughout the story, and part of what makes this series so addictive is the intricate plot with red herrings that make it difficult to figure out motivations and who the actual perpetrators are. Highly recommended for fans of high-quality British crime dramas.

Twilight of the Gods
The episode begins with Morse watching an opera performance by mezzo soprano Gwladys Probert (convincingly portrayed by Sheila Gish). Morse is so overcome by emotion that he is compelled to shout out, ""Bravo!"" Next, we see a middle-aged woman coming upon a murdered man, the victim being a freelance journalist. The journalist had been working on a piece on college benefactor Andrew Baydon. After Morse witnesses his beloved soprano (he develops quite an infatuation) getting shot by a sniper while she stands next to Baydon at the annual procession, he comes to suspect that the two cases might be linked.

This episode is notable for having some famous names in it such as Sir John Gielgud who plays the Chancellor of Oxford, Robert Hardy as college benefactor Andrew Baydon, and a very young Rachel Weisz as Arabella Baydon.

The Way Through the Woods
""Through the Woods"" is a stellar episode featuring impeccable casting and writing. John Thaw as Chief Inspector Morse is a consummate detective who works tirelessly to get at the truth. In this episode, a man convicted as the Lovers Lane Killer, is killed in a prison fight. Although five victims were attributed to this killer whose name is Parnell, the fifth victim, Karen Anderson's body has never been found. Morse's rival and antagonist DI Johnson believes that Karen's body is at the bottom of the lake at Blenheim, but Morse is adamant in that not only is the body not at the bottom of the lake, it is buried somewhere in Wytham Woods. Morse also believes that Parnell is not Karen's killer.

Meanwhile DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) struggles between his loyalty to DCI Morse and a possible promotion if he leaves Morse and joins Johnson at regional headquarters. Lewis feels that Morse takes him for granted, feelings which are only exacerbated by Johnson's constant needling.

The plot is tightly-knit, and there are plenty of red herrings scattered throughout the story. As the story progresses, one suspect after another crops up and is just as easily eliminated, leaving the viewer puzzling out the identity of the elusive killer. When the killer is finally unmasked thanks to Morse's unflagging persistence, it comes as quite a surprise, making this a truly riveting detective drama.

The Daughters of Cain
Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) find themselves a bit out of their depth when confronted by the murder of an academic. Their investigations gradually reveal several interesting details - the politics of university fundraising, the underground drug scene at the college, and the possible involvement of three women working together in the death of another person.

Morse meanwhile, finds himself charmed by one of the female suspects, an attractive and confident younger woman who is clearly involved in some way, but Morse and Lewis find it difficult to prove her involvement. I liked the intricacies of the plot and the surprise element in this case. Unlike most of the cases Morse and Lewis work on, this is one case where some of the perpetrators walk free!

Death is Now My Neighbor
I greatly enjoyed Death is Now My Neighbour. The central plot may revolve around the murders of two people living in the same neighborhood in Oxfordshire, but there's also a second story arc which focuses on the gently evolving romance between Chief Inspector Morse and a potential suspect who shares Morse's candid reflections on life, wit, and a fondness for classical music.

The Wench is Dead
I was a little sad because DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) was not featured in this episode (he is attending an Inspector's course) and it was also a little upsetting to see Morse in such bad physical shape. Not a great episode but the historical angle was interesting.

The Remorseful Day
I admit I cried during the last scene of The Remorseful Day, not just because this was the final episode in what has become one of my favorite British crime dramas, but also because of the touching farewell scene between DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DI Morse (John Thaw). It truly showed the amount of affection and respect shared between these two great men.

The episode focuses on the investigation of the murder of a nurse, Yvonne Harrison, who had been found brutally murdered in her own home. Morse, who is in terrible physical shape due to his rapidly deteriorating health, is put back on the case after he returns from medical leave, much to the chagrin of DS Lewis, who is hoping to be promoted to Inspector and who is genuinely concerned about his superior's health. There is something Morse is not telling Lewis, and it is only much later that Lewis discovers what it is. Meanwhile, the list of suspects grows, as does the list of murdered victims.

Morse and Lewis continue their investigation, working together as a team, and it was bittersweet watching this episode for I knew this was to be their last collaborative effort.",1446940800,2,30024,4.839992204248684
2481478,4,B000E1NWP0,It most certainly did. I am fully satisfied.,1444780800,,44,4.625
2481479,3,B000E1NWP0,"This review is about both the American as well as the Region 2 releases of the series Morse (1987-2000).  I understand the UK disks are Region 2.  I have a player that plays anything I put into it.

The UK disks which I have are divided into two sections Episodes 1-18 and 19-33.  First is the more cerebral half of the series and the secondwell DCI Morse seems to have totally lost his composure.  He is prone to personal distractions as well as other issues such as inferiority which clouds his judgment.

In the first series, he wascool.  the red Jag, the classical LPs, his home, his ability to think and solve the mystery.

The second half is overly dramatic, choppy, and has less than happy endings where the perpetrator or other less scrupulous people meet their demise in a barrage ofwell, anger and gunfire or other means of being accidently killed.

In the Midsomer Murders series, the episodes were kept the same including when happily married Tom Barnaby retired and his cousin Jim took over.  They modeled all these episodes similarly to the first half of Inspector Morse.  This must have been a good formula because Midsomer Murders (1997-) is still being produced, whereas Morsewell, he dies alone of a heart attack in episode 33, The Remorseful Day.

Im not sure of the mentality of those who feel compelled to write episodes like the second half of the Morse series, but I think they seem hell bent on demoralizing the viewer.

Lets take for example the James Bond movies.

I think Bond has or should retire.  His last several movies have taken on a similar genre as the second half of Morse.  I liked 007 because he was impervious and always, so-to say, came out on top.  It was just fun.  Until the last several movies, there was little or no righteous indignation or emphasized human vulnerability.  That I can get from the evening news.

Call me unrealistic and unintellectual if you so desire, but I'm much more attracted to positive fantasy.  After all, at age 66, Im still a kid at heart.",1441756800,18,2012,4.627118644067797

The DVD transcriptions are excellent all around. The one flaw is that the DVDs don't come out of the case easily, but it's still manageable.  The price, of course, is so much better than what PBS in the USA was trying to land (I saw it for close to three fifty USD elsewhere).  It's also very easy to make personal backups, and I'm carrying a couple around on my tablet now.

2481610,5,B000E1NWP0,"""Inspector Morse"" premiered on BBC in 1987 - and yet it does not feel dated. Only occasionally are you reminded it is an older show - once when someone types a letter using carbon paper, and once with a computer using the old DOS (remember green letters on a black screen?)!

I can put up with that, given the exceptional scripts and characterizations. I wish I had room here to give you a synopsis of every episode, or even my favorite episodes. For that matter, there are some scenes which stand out in their excellence.

Inspector Morse (played by John Thaw, now deceased) is cranky, intelligent, tenacious and curious. He loves his pint, he's addicted to crosswords, and he seems to only be attracted to women who are in love with someone else. He is a bull-dog when he sniffs something odd, and he frequently gets in trouble for overstepping.

His murder mysteries are anything but run-of-the-mill and definitely excellent entertainment.

The ""Inspector Morse Complete Collection- Boxed Set"", the only one with a wooden box, includes two of the three 50-minute specials, ""The Story of Morse"" and ""The Making of Morse"". It does not include the 25th anniversary special, ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"".  As noted in the list below, you can buy 2 of these specials separately.

I thought I'd give you a run-down of other options for collecting Inspector Morse. If you are only interested in a favorite episode here or there, I have created a review for each Collection Set and Inspector Morse Set with an episode synopsis, which may help you find the specific episode in which you're interested. I guess these episode synopses, covering all 33 episodes, were truly a labor of love!

EDITED to add: The newer Region 1 collection set, shown as revised item A) below, as far as I can tell, still has No Subtitles and has Not been remastered. I have read that if you have a Region 2 DVD player, you can get this Complete Collection with subtitles and supposedly remastered. There has been such success with other British mystery series being remastered (notably, Miss Marple and Poirot), that is is a shame that a timeless excellent show such as Inspector Morse has not been treated to an update for the fans in Region 1.

A. Inspector Morse Collection Complete Series. This newer collection includes all three of the TV specials: ""The Making of Morse"", ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"" and ""The Story of Morse"" . And, of course, all 33 episodes. The amazon page for this set includes a picture of the back of the set's box, and there is no indication that subtitles are included.

Inspector Morse and Lewis are dedicated to solving crime using their intelligence and training.  At times there may be friction between them, but in the end, Lewis learns quite a lot from the sometimes grumpy Morse.  I think the British crime dramas are far superior to any American crime series.  The Inspector Morse episodes are played periodically on the local PBS stations, but now I can view them in order and as often as I like.

2481614,5,B000E1NWP0,"...he would probably have been Inspector Morse. This is not a fast-paced action series, with lots of dramatic confrontations and shoot-outs. Morse is cerebral, rather gloomy, with a love for classical music and real ale (especially when bought by his faithful sidekick, Sergeant Lewis!). He doesn't like the sight of blood and leaves the more physical side of policing to the uniform branch. Morse is a rebel working in a team, an academic who is contemptuous of academia, a loner who longs for female companionship; in fact, a mass of contradictions. Like Holmes, what he does is who he is and he is impatient that it isn't so for everyone. Poor Lewis, who does have a life outside his job, is constantly called upon to drop everything at Morse's whim.

Such a character would be easy to dislike, but in the hands of John Thaw Morse's foibles become not only acceptable but part of his considerable charm. Morse is vulnerable as well as demanding, compassionate as well as socially awkward. He solves the crimes he is confronted with by using his powers of deduction and knowledge of human nature, not by following tedious routine police methods. His attitude doesn't endear him to his superiors, but he gets results. He's an anachronism in a modern police force- a classical scholar (albeit a failed one) in a job that doesn't cater to intellectual refinement.

The crimes are interesting, the setting is magnificent and the supporting cast is first-class, led by Lewis (Kevin Whately) who is strong enough to carry a successful series on his own. Morse is the benchmark for quality detective shows on TV. Like everyone else, I'm appalled at the price that the complete collection is being offered for; I have all the shows, but collected individually over time. The fact that even so I paid considerably less than the cost of this box set just indicates how overpriced the set is. Surely the loss in numbers of sales must far outweigh the revenue generated by the high price?

However, if you can afford it (or buy it more cheaply in other ways) this is one series you will never regret purchasing. Very highly recommended.",1347494400,,2126,4.8191780821917805

I have had hours of enjoyment which came in a lovely boxed set, well-packaged, with a nice informative booklet.  Each episode is terrific and my only regret is that there will be no more, my only solace is that there is an ""Inspector Lewis"" which is excellent and every bit as wonderfully acted, with great locations, and exciting and well written plots. The team of ""Lewis and Hathaway"" is just as dynamic as was the team of ""Morse and Lewis"", different chemistry but just as charismatic.  I feel like I am watching real people, in fact, the acting is so effortless that it seems as if they are not having to act. What a joy!

The book that comes with the Morse set is very helpful as well and very interesting.  The only negative comment is the wooden box.

2481641,5,B000E1NWP0,"I purchased all the Inspector Morse DVDs and have watched the episodes over and over again. I've never found a series I like better. Perhaps it's because the classically beautiful city of Oxford is not only the physical location for most of the stories, but also an ideal intellectual setting for plots featuring characters engaged in the life of the mind.

The first time I heard Morse repeating the last verses of Tennyson's poem ""Ulysses"" to Chief Superintendent Strange--
""Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are....""

--I knew I was hooked on Morse for life.

I'm glad PBS decided to produce the Inspector Lewis series with some of the same characters and aesthetics as Morse. While I've been happy to see Kevin Whately return in his role as Lewis, it's Detective Sergeant Hathaway who reminds me most of their predecessor, the intriguingly intelligent and brooding Morse.

If you enjoy Morse, Lewis, and Hathaway as I do, you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius, available at Amazon. It's an intelligent thriller that begins at the University of Oxford with a murder resulting from the response people have to a controversial viewpoint dating back to the Nicene Council.",1338595200,3,1322,4.862222222222222

This has to be one of the best TV detective dramas that the Brits, or anyone else, have come up with. Colin Dexter's stories are well written, and the characters adapt well to the screen thanks to the excellent acting of the late John Thaw. Morse is a sometimes sad, yet always admirable character. Kevin Whately, as the often painfully naive Lewis, is the perfect foil to Morse's intellect and love of culture.

We had already watched the Inspector Lewis series before we started watching Morse.  We are planning on watching Lewis again from start to finish.

Morse is not exactly a lovable old curmudgeon much of the time.  The dynamic between Morse and Lewis is really wonderful to watch.  Morse is such a legend in the department (with both accolades and blemishes) that it takes a while for Lewis to find his footing.  However, by the end it is clear (and kind of fun) to realize that Lewis makes a huge contribution to solving each crime.  Sometimes while Morse is spouting off or getting reprimanded or whatever, Lewis's facial expressions are priceless.

Some of the episodes were quite haunting and will stay with me for a long while.

The book is very handy for keeping track are if you are watching the episodes in sequence.  Each episode is on a separate CD so it's easy to forget where you are.  Be aware, though, that the book contains plot summaries and spoilers abound.

When you consider everything that comes in this set - 55 hours of video, a nice book with photos and details of the locations, a storage box - it really is worth the money.

The Amazon marketplace vendor offered to give me a full refund (didn't have a replacement), but, as any self-respecting Inspector Morse fan will tell you, no one wants a full refund for a collection in this price range; the only reason anyone would pay these prices is that they really want the full, complete collection.

2481724,5,B000E1NWP0,A great series but the pricing here is a reminder that for those who love British drama and mystery a multi-system DVD is a great investment.  Amazon.co.uk is selling an equivalent set new for 42 pounds-- shipping is only 3 pounds so you get the same set for less than $70 at the current exchange rate.,1226620800,10,302,4.392857142857143
2481725,5,B000E1NWP0,"I may break down and spend the money for this complete library of ""Inspector Morse"" I have seen all episodes and own only a few of the episodic DVD's. I am glad that they decided to gather all of the episodes of this fine television series. Superior writing, plot contstruction, direction and casting. It was the best of the best. I loved Thaw's ""Kavanaugh"" series as well. Loved his mini series that came on either PBS or AETV. He will be missed.",1210291200,4,447,4.463414634146342

John Thaw and cast, writers, just everything in this series is top notch.
Do yourselves a favor and find other John Thaw stuff ""A Year in Provence"" comes to mind. Totally different, but just as captivating.
Do not miss the MORSE series!
Sadly we do not have John Thaw anymore to entertain us, a man of his stature comes along very seldom!!!

2481727,5,B000E1NWP0,"I was not sure whether I would like Inspector Morse when I bought the entire collection. My fears were unfounded. Although each episode moves at a leisurely pace, each one is delicately spun and crafted. The aristocratic airs of Morse add a wonderful snobbery to his character. The background score, the wonderful Oxford environs, and the riveting plot lines make this an incredible series to watch. I loved each episode but particularly loved ""Service of All the Dead"" in which the multiple murders in a church had a wonderfully eerie feel. Highly recommended intelligent TV viewing.",1194652800,7,584,5.09375
2481728,5,B000E1NWP0,"These are really expensive DVD's, which seriously limits the audience. But, if you missed some or all of the PBS shows, and you can spring for the tab, you'll be a happy customer. Morse is so incredibly flawed, he is absolutely believable. Most detective stories have a cop who is a lot like cardboard. I mean, really, where are the dimensions. Not Morse. Here you get a genuine person tracking clues, or just following hunches, and making his share of blunders along the way. By the way, John Thaw (Morse) and Kevin Whately (Lewis) were the reason the stories were tops. A good cop who-done-it in the USA:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skinwalkers-Joe-Leaphorn-Jim-Chee-Novels/dp/0061000175/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skinwalkers (Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee Novels)</a>",1188518400,7,810,6.052173913043478
