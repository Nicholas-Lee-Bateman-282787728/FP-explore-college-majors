8365106,1,B002DGS0PG,"Despite never having any problems playing DVDs in my DVD player before, this DVD has a tendency to freeze up. Although the programing that I could get to was ok, I found it irritating that I had to stop and go back through (start over) the entire menu to play each individual stretch (it would not simply go through them in succession). After doing this for about 6 stretches I got an error message (operation not allowed)and gave up. In the end my neck was tighter than when I had started. I plan to store this DVD away in the ""circular file"" (money wasted). Too difficult to use. My DVD player is playing all of my other DVDs just fine. This DVD showed promise but the poor quality of the recording and inability to have it run automatically through all of the stretches earns it only 1 star in my book.",1298160000,,805,4.337748344370861
8365107,3,B002DGS0PG,"I was so irritated by the unbelievably slow & frustrating navigation on this DVD I put it away and have not tried it again yet. Should have returned it but could not find the paperwork. The model is androgenous looking, which is a tad disconcerting.",1284249600,,249,4.555555555555555
8365108,5,B002DGS0PG,"Detailed stretches.  All of the ones I've purchased (hips, neck shoulders etc.) are Great.

  I would highly recommend.",1283817600,,119,5.444444444444445
8365109,4,B002DGS0PG,"I love this dvd. I have learnt so much.

Sadly I need a dvd that is easy to follow on a daily basis. I want to just stick it in and do 10, 15, 20 whatever minutes and just follow a set of flowing stretches. Instead I have to constantly be pressing a button on the remote to go back and forth so see the next mvt. SO I feel like I need her, and want to follow her but she is hard to follow.

I would still recommend her because she is sooooo smart and knows what she is doing and explains it well. In fact after listening to her I now have a good idea what to look for in the excercise program I will choose. I do plan to keep checking if she gets an easier program to follow on a daily basis. And I will get her hip paim dvd.",1272844800,,725,3.7012987012987013
8365110,5,B002DGS0PG,"I bought this video after not having time to make it to physical therapy a few times a week. I was biking when I got hit by a car, and suffered a broken neck. It healed on it's own (didn't need surgery), but I needed relief from the pain that didn't go away after a few months. I knew that my neck pain wasn't helped by my poor posture. This DVD helped from the first minute I started using it. There is a lot of useful information on this DVD. It included a mobility test, how to identify where the pain comes from, what muscles are related, etc. And then there is a section that you can go to quickly that is just sets of stretches. I like that the stretches were not just the stretches you use on a high school sports team, they were very particular and helped me find the stretches that have helped ease the pain. I have only done this for a few days, but am surprised at the amount of relief I have found. I think if you stick to the exercises and do them every day, you will find relief in a few weeks.",1257465600,6,1008,4.019900497512438
8365111,5,B002DGS0PG,"I have a lot of damage to my spine in my neck from years of tight muscles and poor posture.  Even though I can't change the damage, this DVD helped me understand how to improve my posture when sitting, or while I am going through my day activities.  It has helped reduce the stresses in my neck and has helped my mobility.  I have more range of motion when trying to turn my neck. The stretches give me such relief from neck pain and the stiffness in my neck has decreased.  I was afraid that I would live the rest of my life with this neck pain and stiffness I see now that I can reverse some of the damage I have done.  Paula Rohr",1248825600,7,632,4.024
8365112,5,B002DGS0PG,"I have used this DVD for about 3 months ( I have chronic pain) and not only has it relieved my neck pain but my tinnitus has resolved as well. The best part is that the menu lets me skip right to the issue I am dealing with. In the morning I watch it and imitate the stretches I need. With other DVD's I had to watch the whole program in order to get to the parts I needed and I found it hard to see exactly what the trainer was doing because the angle the person was shot from was distorted. The animations on this DVD make it crystal clear what to stretch and how to stretch it. Another thing I liked is the educational part of the video. When I began stretching my neck I had no idea where the pain was coming from. The DVD showed me which muscles were involved and now I have a better understanding of how those muscles create pain in other areas. If I feel a pain in my neck I get out the hot water pad and put it on the correct muscle. Then I stretch again. (In my case it was my upper back) I also got a second one for my son who sits at the computer all day. I have never written a review about a DVD before but I had to comment on the benefits I received from this. If you are in pain like I am buy this DVD and find some relief!
