8228365,5,B000XHSTCQ,Talk about an old goodie. Really enjoyed this railroad film. To non railroad people it is likely lost that the Santa Fe 3000 series locomotives only ran for a couple years being the largest locos in the world at the time. This this is a very rare coverage. It is a must for railfans.,1411603200,,283,4.2592592592592595
