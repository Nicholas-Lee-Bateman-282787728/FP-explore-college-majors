6388999,5,B00JQB3GN2,"How does Season 2 of Hemlock Grove tie in with Season 1?, you might ask.  Well, not by very much.  Shelly is a player as is Clementine's brother Michael.  Peter and Roman start out at odds then end up as friends said allies.  But that's jumping the gun - a lot.

Hemlock Grove is a great example of what a network can do when they put their minds to entertainment that's actually entertaining.  Much like American Horror Story, Netflix' Hemlock Grove dares to be different.

The backstory to Season Two is the birth of Nadia by his cousin and her living at Roman's house.  Miranda, at the ""behest"" of the good doctor, has become a member of the township while her car is being repaired.  Staying at Peter's and finding Nadia, Nadia and Miranda become very close and it becomes apparent the two were meant to be together.

Hemlock Grove has as many secrets as it offers answers.  This is a thinking person's show and not to be taken as fluff.  Enjoy it for the series it is.",1443916800,4,973,4.404494382022472

6389001,5,B00JQB3GN2,"Just occasionally, American TV dares to make something as weird as Hemlock Grove and, through the perspicacity of someone important, manages to browbeat the network bean-counters into not cancelling it after the first series.

Not conforming to any of the standard fantasy / horror formulae, Hemlock Grove is a splendid mishmash of themes and mythologies with teen vampire types, werewolves (most definitely not given the soppy Twilight or the Scooby-gang Buffy treatment), shady police (but not in the procedural Grimm manner), shadier secret societies (without the Dan Brown pseudo-mysticism) and, of course, a mad genius scientist or two (without going all Walter Bishop on us). Throw in a bucketful of languid atmosphere, soak liberally in gore and sprinkle a dusting of light wit and you have Hemlock Grove.

Season two picks up some time after Season ones cataclysmic finale; Roman and Peter have gone their separate ways, poor Shelly is missing, Dr Chasseurs brother is now sheriff, the now financially independent  Norman is seeking to avenge the death of his wife and daughter, Olivia is still Olivia and the Bishops illuminate sect is up to something.  Enter a mysterious girl conveniently stranded in the Grove, Romans Alia-like baby daughter, an Eastern European doctor at the institute equally as mad as the splendid Dr. Johann Pryce, a string of murders and prescient shared dreams. The only thing missing is Romans beautiful car from Season one, replaced by an anonymous Mercedes or something  shame.

The plot piles along at a cracking pace and the all too short ten episode season is over far too soon but not without many a plot twist and surprise or two, Theres no surreal, incomprehensible episode this time (unlike Season ones Catabasis) but thats not to say that is isn't weird, dark and yeah weeeeird.

If you enjoyed Season One then you're in for a treat with this season. The third and final season is currently being filmed in Canada and is due to premiere in the US sometime in 2015. Excellent!",1432512000,11,2021,5.014925373134329

8653244,4,B00JQB3GN2,For something completely different i really liked this show. to bad only 3 seasons were made. my only negative on the entire show is based on dvd format availability. why do we have to wait so long to get dvd's in the u.s. and canada formats. and we'll be waiting to long on this season and season 3 in the future on u.s. and canada formats. right now if you cant have in your collection your stuck having to watch it on netflix,1456185600,,428,4.168674698795181

8653246,3,B00JQB3GN2,"Season 2 started off really well and kept it's momentum until the last several episodes. Towards the end, the weird fight scenes set to gangsta music gave it an off-putting ""crouching werewolf, hidden vampire"" vibe.
All and all it was entertaining but I think ending it in it's third season was a good idea.",1452297600,,307,4.703703703703703
