2368558,4,B000A6T2BW,"Alias had always been one of my favorite shows and it probably always will be.  This season was a step up from last season but still had things that could have been changed to make it better like the excellent seasons 1 and 2.  This season started out as contained episodes, meaning they have a problem and solve it all in one episode.  No over lapping episode storylines like the fans of Alias are used to.  This also meant no more cliffhangers, which is a deffiant no-no for the show because we all loved the amazing cliffhangers that the past seasons have had.  While all of this episodes were good they just weren't the 5-star suspense and action we are used to on Alias.

  The season began to turn around in the middle of the season.  We were presented with an excellent episode(Tuesday) and starting getting a interesting storyling about Vaughn's father.  From here the season kicked off into high gear.  From evil aunts and returning kick-ass mothers the second part of this season was what we were used to in this show.  So when buying the DVD's give it time.  The season will kick off and it will be worth it.

  Some of the highlights are 4.05 ""Libery Villiage"" where Vaughn and Sydeny go undercover as a married couple who are russian assasins.  ""Echos"" & ""Man of his Word""-Where two of our favorite evil villians return.  ""Another Mr. Sloane""- Where a imposter Sloane appears and we find our someone close to our characters is bad.  ""Search and Rescue""- Alias at it's best.  and the explosive season finale with a ending cliffhanger that will have saying Oh My God!!!!!!!

  So overall while not as good as the first 2 seasons it is better then the third and a recommended buy for everyone.  This is TV at it's best!!!!!",1121731200,7,1733,4.5519480519480515
2368559,5,B000A6T2BW,"Premiering in September 2001, Alias has built a steady and loyal following among television viewers. The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files. It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman. But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...

Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency. However, problems arise when her fianc&eacute; is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all... In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent. Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work. Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...

The Alias (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Authorized Personnel Only"" in which Sydney quits the CIA in favor of joining a secret organization known as Authorized Personnel Only. Meanwhile, the answers Sydney uncovered in Wittenberg threaten to ruin her relationship with Jack, at least until she is forced to join forces with her father in an effort to track down a dangerous samurai... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""D&eacute;tente"" in which Sydney and Nadia go undercover together in order to dig up the location of a deadly chemical, and ""Nightingale"" in which Sydney and Vaughn risk their lives to find out the truth about Vaughn's father...

2368560,5,B000A6T2BW,"this has got to be one of the best series about at the moment, and has definetely filled a whole where my favourites shows had ended like buffy,xena etc... i really like this show!!!

who couldn't with non-stop spying action and one of the best actresses in the world in jennifer garner who plays the lead role of sydney bristow, a spy who's world is turned upside down in just a few short years.

relationships become strained, old acquaintices resurface and are reunited.

season 4 is a little bit more family orientated aswell.",1121644800,4,530,4.67741935483871
2368561,5,B000A6T2BW,"The writers of this show did a pretty good job this season compared to their season 3 distaster. Although not as good as the first two seasons, this season is great. It starts out with Sydney finding out her mother is dead and that Jack (her father) did the killing. Vaughn is given misleading clues to a series of episodes where he is trying to find out if his father is alvie or not due to being given one of his diaries. There is a great guest star during this part of the season. For character development, this season had it. You got to learn a lot about Syds sister and Jack's past. They bring Irian's second sister who was Nadia's foster mom into it in the last part of the season who is trying to get some Rambaldi facts from the CIA. Sloane goes with her and at the very last second of the season Syd and Vaughn, driving, are hit by a car, and that's the end of the season.",1121385600,5,882,4.133720930232558
2368562,5,B000A6T2BW,"Season 1 to Season 4 - Alias constantly continues to deliver the goods. Simply one of THE best shows on TV, and possibly the most underrated, Alias never fails to deliver the most exciting cliffhangers and the most exciting drama there is.

So wonderful to see new relationships blossom (Nadia & Weiss), almost as good as seeing Lena Olin making a comeback at the end of the season.

5/5 for the season. From vampire-like characters, to clones and a killer season finale, Season 4 will most definitely not dissapoint an avid Alias fan!",1121126400,7,535,4.741935483870968
2368563,5,B000A6T2BW,"Alias is one of those shows that never fails to blow your socks away every time you watch it.  The show always opens with guns barroling, and they don't stop until a heartstopping cliff-hanger.  J.J. Abrams alwasy said that he made the show as an omage to the classic serial of television of the silver age.

The show is constantly changing its promise, but for the most part it centers around Sydney Bristow (the female equivalent of James Bond) and her misandventures with Michael Vaughn her cohert and lover as they try to protect their country and family.  Originally Sydney had been working for SD6 (a subossed secret department of CIA) until they killed her fiance, her astranged father finally todl her that she was working for the enemy she thought she was fighting.  For the next season and a half, Sydney was a double agent, until the real CIA overtook SD6.  Very soon after that she was in a fight that resulted in her walking up 2 years later with no memory.  The third season was about Sydney tying to recover her missing years.

The fourth season finds Sydney getting back on with her life after figuring out her past.  With her newly discovered sister by her side, she goes back to doing what she does best (being a secret agent) until rumbling about her long thought dead Mother start to come around again.

This season was a welcome breath of fresh air from the past season.  Originally shown over 20 consecutive weeks, Seaosn 4 provided a semi-light hearted alternative to the dark and depressing third season.  Although not the best (that honor will alwasy go to season 2), this season definatly shows its strength.  How know where this show will go now, as they start production with a very pregnant star in only a few weeks.",1121126400,8,1745,4.626623376623376

Jennifer Garner is amazingly versatile and gorgeous always! Michael Vartan is incredibly good and compelling as one of the most charismatic and beautiful men I have ever seen on the screen. Why is he not already a MAJOR triple A star as I feel he is far more handsome and wonderful than many other A stars out there. Timing perhaps - needs a new agent maybe!

There are those who would argue that they're all the same, but set in different locales.  While that is true to a point, the only true consistency occurring phenom is that the good guys don't make certain when the blow up or shoot the bad guys, that the evil doer is actually dead.  They just show up again later to do more evil.  Still, it is good solid entertainment if you, as I do, enjoy suspense and action.

2369028,5,B000A6T2BW,I liked this movie because it has a lot of action in it .It keeps you in suspense wondering what will happen next. I would recommend this movie to all my friends ! It is a real good series !,1389139200,,190,3.775
2369029,4,B000A6T2BW,It is like every other series. They have pretty much exausted all of the writers imagination. Sidney cries more than the ghost whisperer and there are way to many office romances for the CIA.,1388793600,,191,4.647058823529412

2369031,4,B000A6T2BW,"The cast is good, the stories entertaining, lots of action, good acting, character driven, but a bit too cartoonish and too many character inconsistencies. There are too many times you have to let your idea of reality vanish. For example, Sydney can often disable 3 or 4 trained, large male mercenaries on one occasion but can be bested by an untrained old man on another occasion. If the characters were more consistent, I would have given it 5 stars.",1388707200,,452,4.734177215189874
2369052,3,B000A6T2BW,"I confess I am slightly behind the times. I caught ALIAS when I bought a SMART TV just a few weeks ago. I had not had TV for several years. I am now watching this through Amazon Prime for the first time. I was hooked after the first episode and really looked forward to the story unraveling. However, I tend to agree with previous reviews. I was wholly interested for the first three seasons. By season four, it starts to become predictable. How many times has Stark been captured, then allowed to assist in a mission only to escape and be captured all over again? His allegiance is unpredictable, but predictable at the same time. He'll do something to assist the CIA but then help the enemy too. Still too, it seems that while you never know truly where some of the character's allegiance is, by season four you can count on a surprise shift in allegiance from an unsuspecting character only to learn that it was a set-up to begin with. The relationship between Vaughn and Sydney becomes ambiguous by season four too. Granted it is par for the course in the espionage, spy-fi action genre. Still some of the action are beyond mildly realistic. The sound effects could have been toned down slightly. At times it sounds as if combatants are getting clobbered with blows capable of rendering an elephant disabled. Characters simply walk away unscathed from what sounds like it should have been a more gruesome outcome. I know, I know, it's TV, land of make believe and all that. But as stated, the first three seasons are somewhat believable. By season four it's the same old same old. I'll follow through with the rest of this season and season five though. Perhaps it gets better for the finale.",1388188800,,1696,4.619205298013245

2369054,2,B000A6T2BW,"The story is really getting stretched.  It's impossible to think that only 2-4 operatives of an organization do every mission.  After intense physical confrontations that often result in life threatening injuries they just appear as though nothing happened at all.  There are huge gaps in the story lines of each episode with no explanation.  The first two seasons were a bit more plausible and were fun because Jennifer garner's character has fabulous wardrobe changes.  And she's pretty easy to outfit.  But the more the story goes, the more amusing it is to see how contrived it is.  I am going to stop watching it after having watched all of the seasons and episodes leading up to Season 5.",1386979200,,694,4.830508474576271

2369056,3,B000A6T2BW,"JJ Abrams establishes his trends early in season 4, that the Alias series is winding down and there's really nothing new to write about here.  It's unfortunate.  His minions would follow this trend while ""ending"" Lost a few years later.

2369214,3,B000A6T2BW,"Alias: The Fourth Season was disappointing and not up to par as seasons 1-3. In the 4th season, new characters were introduced that detracted from the familiar main characters (i.e. Jack, Sydney, Vaughn, Sloane), and the addition of Nadia was annoying as a hero/anti-hero/quasi-zombie (although she is beautiful). This 4th season deserves 3 stars because:

1. There were a lot more beautiful women, besides Sydney (i.e. Nadia, and the other 2 new CIA/APO agents).
2. The plot thickened surrounding the ""Rambaldi"" artifacts/meaning.
3. The season finale left you wondering who slammed their car into the car that Sydney and Vaughn (or is that his Alias...) were driving in. Excellent cliffhanger!",1372032000,,695,5.318181818181818

for seson 5. Sydney, her mom and sister save the day, & the planet,
 and it will bring a tear to your eye, EVEN though no one dies. that's all I'll give away!
 I actually liked it this way, because all the episodes were so good and imaginative.
But I also didn't complain when they were renewed and all the ALIAS fans got another
season (season 5) kind of like a gift. But WOW! did they take ALIAS in a different direction.
Guess they had to after season four.

2369341,3,B000A6T2BW,"Withdrawing from the format of previous years and concentrating more on individual plots than cliffhangers, Alias' fourth season is one of the strongest the show has to offer. It's full of the twists and turns that producer and writer J.J. Abrams loves to throw our way, but is also concentrates on more streamlined plots and focuses less on Rambaldi. It may be my favorite season.

When an extraction goes wrong abroad and results in the death of a fellow agent, Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is forced to hand in her resignation to the CIA. Or so most of her fellow agents believe. In reality, she has been hand chosen from the best the agency has to offer to become part of a black ops group known as APO. With more liberty than government-sanctioned branches of the agency, APO has a much wider scope ... from halting terrorists in their tracks to rescuing operatives from the field. Excited to be part of this great opportunity, Sydney is devastated to learn that the entire operation is under the command of Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin). Formerly the head of one of the largest underground terrorist groups in the world, Sloane has bought his way back into the CIA's favor by turning over a priceless artifact.

Sloane's second in command is Sydney's estranged father Jack (Victor Garber), whom she blames for the recent murder of her mother. While attempting to repair that broken relationship and find out the truth behind the assassination, Sydney is kidnapped by a dangerous foreign agent, forcing Sloane to recruit his daughter and her half sister, Nadia (Ma Maestro) to assist in her rescue. The sisters form a close bond as other familiar faces are recruited into their organization, from Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), and Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), to the lovable, brainy Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman). Sydney must put aside personal feelings and work with Sloane to ""save the world.""

Then comes the complications, everything from British spies in custody to old rivalries, accumulating in a search through the dark past as Vaughn attempts to discern what really happened to his father, Sloane tries to turn over a new leaf, and Sydney learns the true meaning of family. I must admit that the first couple of episodes seem a little disjointed, as they attempt to introduce us to the entirely new format of the series, but after that the speed picks up and the audience enjoys watching the twists and turns unfold. There are plenty of undercover operations, dangerous situations, hand-to-hand fights, clever remarks, and different disguises to keep us enraptured. But more intriguing are the different relationships between characters. Nadia's budding romance with Eric Weiss (Greg Grunberg), and Sydney's never-ending struggle over whether or not to trust her father.

Content issues are also surprisingly limited this season. It is implied that Sydney and Vaughn have an active sexual relationship; in the first episode, they are seen making out in bed, and later in the series while undercover as husband and wife, they take a shower together. On one other occasion, he's seen sleeping in her room. Sydney often dons provocative outfits to provide distractions. The first five minutes of season four have her in a white teddy, flirting with a suspect before she knocks him unconscious. On two other occasions she lures men into traps by intimating she's interested in sleeping with them. There's some mild sexual dialogue. Language is almost nonexistent this year, and most of the violence consists of the norm.

Lots of people are shot at and/or killed, with gruesome results. People are punched, kicked, thrown through walls and into furniture, beat with furniture and other household appliances, or anything within reach. There are massive explosions and shootouts. Nadia has a flashback to the orphanage in which she attempted to save one of her friends from being kidnapped; the memory has her as a child beating mercilessly beaten about the head; then as a teenager, being similarly abused by a corrupt policeman. There are occasional moments of gore, such as a stomach-turning scene in which a man is destroyed by nuclear radiation, and the skin literally melts off his body. Sloane goes temporarily insane and beats a man to death with a pipe. Information is also extracted from informants through beatings and bullets. On a couple of occasions, the hero must kill someone in order to maintain their cover (and experiences a certain amount of guilt).

For most adults, season four is a tension-filled glimpse into the underworld of intelligence. I hope and pray that our agents aren't forced to do these kinds of things, but at the same time am grateful at times that they do, in order to keep us safe. The characters of Alias are far from perfect and often suffer the devastating consequences of their actions, but are human enough that we grow to understand and like them, no matter what they do. The only real danger here is accepting that the end justifies the means, and it is sometimes appropriate to make bad decisions and do evil things in order to save the day. It's never right to commit murder, and it's hard to approve of someone being beaten for information, no matter who they are.",1363824000,,5228,4.962328767123288

The story line has a nice continuity and characters are well established. There are always surprises in every episode.

2369524,4,B000A6T2BW,"While it had the most favorable time spot of any season and also brought in the best ratings the large majority of the fans agree this year is of lesser quality than the first two, for me personally it's a step down from the first three as I adore season 3. Outside of introducing a new major character and getting a lot of her back story this is much more of a stand-alone, week-to-week season than the very serialized first three years that the cult-like following of the show was so drawn into. That's not meant to say it isn't still more serialized than your normal cop, medical, or procedural drama but it has more stand-alone episodes than any other season with room to spare and as a result the season-long product drops a bit. Some of these loner episodes are very good and popular, in their isolated and singular way, but the season-long experience I get from the first three years of the show where I can't start the next episode fast enough is largely missing from season four and the show wasn't quite the same without that established format and pacing. Towards the very end of the season it tries to get back into the overriding arc a bit but these story lines are far-fetched for me for a show that based itself essentially in our real world with a few big mythical elements, not in an outright vampire or zombie horror movie world.

It's still certainly a season of television worth watching, particularly if you're already into the series, but at times it does seem a bit like a different show than what you see in the first three years. This, along with season five though it's very different stylistically than four, is ""good,"" television in my view whereas for me Season one was great and seasons two and three were just legendary. By this point Alias most certainly wasn't bad by any means, it was past its prime however.",1340409600,2,1842,4.531531531531532

2369529,5,B000A6T2BW,"The fourth season of Alias ranks among my favorites, second only to the second season.  The action is fast-paced and it never feels like there's a dull moment.  I love the addition of Mia Maestro to the cast (we met her character very late in the third season) as Sydney Bristow's half sister Nadia Santos.  Nadia is the daughter of Syd's mother, Irina Derevko, and her arch nemesis, Arvin Sloane.

The relationship between Sydney and her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) is tested once again when Syd learns that her father murdered her mother in cold blood after learning Irina had put a contract out on Syd's life.  They actually filmed the scene, which is shown as a flashback.  I absolutely love the chemistry between Victor Garber and Lena Olin.  This does produce a slight continuity question, however.  When the flashback is shown, toward the end of season four, it says ""eighteen months earlier"" at the bottom of the screen.  Eighteen months prior to the end of season four would place this event as sometime during the middle of the third season.  Since Lena Olin did not appear in the third season, one has to conclude that Jack carried this out off-screen, which is certainly fine, but it would have to have occurred right after Jack and Irina stopped communicating via IRC instant messaging, which was actually towards the end of season three in an episode called ""Blood Ties.""  So if the murder of Irina Derevko occurred eighteen moths prior to the end of season four, that means some significant time had to pass between seasons three and four.

Anyway, I digress ... it turns out Irina Derevko is alive!  Alias pulls this off beautifully ... think back to season two and the Francie/Alison fiasco.  Season four also sees Greg Grunberg and his character Eric Weiss (Vaughn's best friend)get a lot more screen time as Weiss and Nadia become an item.  The always awesome David Anders returns Julian Sark.  Fan favorite Gina Torres (Syd's former K-Directorate nemesis, Anna Espinosa) returns as well.  Season four reintroduces Katya Derevko, played to perfection by Isabella Rossellini, who was featured in three episodes in the third season) and the third (and deadliest) Derevko of them all ... Elena, played by the wonderful Sonia Braga.  This is the only season to feature all three Derevko sisters.

Some other highlights from this season include ""the Arvin Clone,"" Sloane (Ron Rifkin) being placed in charge by the CIA legitimately, Vaughn (Michael Vartan) learning more about why his father was killed and what he was really involved in, Sloane's attempts to be a father (which make Jack look like the poster child for fatherhood).  We also see much more of Marshall's' life as a father and a husband; he even pulls an interesting deception over on Jack.

One final thing to mention ... as much as I enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan, it is the chemistry between Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin that truly made this series amazing.",1321920000,,2979,4.871031746031746

2369587,2,B000A6T2BW,"This season was a disappointment for me. All I can think about is how much potential there was within the story and characters and these things were seemingly abandoned. The season as a whole lacks in the strong characterization the series had in its first three seasons. Sydney, who was a such a great character is very flat in this season and the same goes for the rest of the characters. I think maybe there were too many characters this season and so not a lot of attention could be paid to any of them individually.

The first half of the season is episodic and really disappointing. The episode ending cliffhangers which I loved so much over the first three seasons were gone which left every episode a bit flat. I learned later that the network asked for the episodes to be stand alone and cliffhanger-less to appeal to new viewers. The season premiere, which I was excited about after the cliffhanger at the end of season three, was disappointing because I felt like it didn't make sense with what I saw at the end of season three and I later learned this was retconned, I assume because maybe they had some problems getting some actors to reappear. This I think ruined Sydney's character arc for the season. The second half of the season gets better as the story arc is resumed and there were some great moments in these episodes, but it took far too long to get to them and still the characterization remained flat. The story arc could have used a lot more build up and had more of an impact on the characters themselves. The season finale was good, but I think it should have been great.

I still highly anticipate watching the fifth season.",1224806400,,1652,4.521739130434782

2369590,3,B000A6T2BW,"I sit here to write this review having seen 21 of the 22 episodes this season so as to avoid the possibility of spoilers. J.J. Abrams Alias is still a good show and a fun watch but the fourth season has lost some of the luster of the previous three. Maybe Abrams is spending too much time on his new series Lost to care what happens here maybe the network demanded too many changes in format. Hopefully some of these issues will be resolved in thhe final season.

When I started watching this show I was amazed by both the acting and the writing. It was rare to have a network show with story arcs that kept you hanging on from week to week. I was also intrigued with the idea of Milo Rambaldi. The Fourt Season took both of these interests away. In this season the network demanded simplier stories that the casual viewer could watch and forget about. The result was a sort of bad guy of the week that was more X Files than Alias. I'm not really complaining some of the stand alone episodes were excellent just not the same. When the true story of the season got going it was just a little too late to be developed properly.

the acting in the series has always been excellent and this season was no exception. Fine performances were turned in by Jennifer Garner, Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin and some of the guests were quite good. Sonia Braga and Isabella Rossellini as the Derevko sisters and the return, albeit short, of Lena Olin helped save the show at a time it was desperately needed.

The six disc set by Touchstone is well designed despite the fact that the discs overlap. The picture and sound quality are excellent and the extra features are numerous. Speaking of these extras it would be nice if the commentary tracks could be spread over the entire season instead of being focused on the first episodes only.

The end result is a good season but bot great. But hey its television and a guilty pleasure all the same. Looking forward to Season Five.",1187481600,2,1962,4.426592797783933

It is nice to see Greg Grunberg's Eric Weiss character with more to do. He is one of my favorites on the show. The addition of Sidney's sister doesn't really feel worth while until about mid season, where the stories really start to get better and plot lines start to come back into focus from previous seasons.

2369639,4,B000A6T2BW,"After the disappointment of season 3 to many fans, Alias goes back to basics. Alias basically started over. A new night of the week helped Alias grab its best ratings ever for season 4, and unlike the first 3 seasons most of these episodes play as stand alones, and with the complexity of most of the storylines, that may have helped new viewers jump into the action without needing to hear the back story.

Being a hardcore Alias fan, I didn't like the idea of stand alones at first. Part of the reason I love the show is the season long storyline that twists and turns after every episode. Having said that, the first two episodes of season 4 blew me away, with one exeption. The cliffhanger of season 3 isn't even resolved until the beginning of episode 2. That bothered me a lot at first but the more and more I watched this season the more I think it worked out brilliantly. The new plan to make stand alone eps they resolved it in such a way that didn't require you to have seen the cliffhanger of season 3.

There is a season long storyline that starts off slow, really slow, but toward the halfway mark of season 4 it picks up pace at a good speed and it well worth it by the end. The last few eps of season 4 are near perfection, but so are several mid way through.

The episodes in the middle are stand alones as I said but have a continuing storyline thats easy to catch on to but not the main point of the story. Two of the best of the season are episodes 6 and 7, ""Nocturne"" and ""Detente"".

The packaging is beautiful. Out of the 5 seasons of this show this set is the best to look at. It doesn't hurt that everyone in this season looks their best. A very nice set with tons of extras as well.

So if anyone has yet to see a full season and is just interested in watching a few (after seeing it you'll want to watch them all!) this is the one to grab since it's easy to follow and will get you hooked immediately.",1167350400,7,1926,4.152815013404826

Viewed in the proper order, Syd and Vaughn carefully and slowly rebuild their relationship and Syd's relationship with Nadia evolves nicely.

Here's the proper order:  APO (parts one and two), Awful Truth, Detente, Ice, Nocturne, Echoes, Man of His Word, Welcome to Liberty Village, and then on home.  Actually Tuesday should follow Another Mr. Sloan, but works o.k. where they showed it.",1163203200,3,626,5.1683168316831685

2369662,5,B000A6T2BW,"Alias: Season 4.  Wow.  The characters have been through heck in the first three seasons, much of it caused by a man named Arvin Sloane, and afterwards by a group called The Covenant.  In a stroke of genius, now the best of both SD-6 and the CIA are combined into APO, and headed up by (guess who?) Arvin Sloane, the guy everybody loves to hate.

The usual cast of Jennifer Garner, Michael Vartan, Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, and etc. are accompanied by the absolutely adorable Mia Maestro, who plays Sydney's half-sister Nadia Santos.  Throw in some nice guest stars like Angela Bassett, some Derevko sisters (yes, plural) and a person or two who you probably thought was dead, and you've got a great season, culminating in the ultimate family team-up to take down a terrible Rambaldi device that could trigger the next apocalypse!  And of course...The Chosen One must battle The Passenger.  And only one...will survive.  Unless you want either one to be in the next season, in which case, they might live.  But I'm not sayin' if they both survive or not, 'cause that'd be a spoiler.

And the big shocker at the very end of the season, wow.  Let's just say not everyone is who they claim to be.  Now I don't know what happens in Season 5, except that somebody gets a clip or two unloaded in 'em and there's probably a double or a clone or two somewhere in there.  (I saw a few moments of the series finale...not knowing how great a show it was at the time.)  Whatever the case, while I admit there was a creepy episode or two in there, Season 4 comes on strong and has a well-deserved place amongst the other three seasons, all of which I enjoyed.  Trust me, you won't be let down by Season 4 if you enjoyed the other three.  I highly recommend it.",1162771200,6,1748,4.449685534591195
2369663,2,B000A6T2BW,"Unlike most people here, I very much enjoyed Season 3. It had a compelling story line and numerous villains who were played superbly. I don't understand all the season 3 hate, but apparently it's mostly to do with people being angry that Syd and Vaughan weren't together, and having to pay attention across multiple weeks.

Season 3 ended with Syd finding a top secret file about her, dated 1976. Jack walks in to find a sobbing Syd, telling her that she was never meant to find that file. Reasonable people would assume that the file contains something momentous about Syd's life. Instead, Season 4 tells us that a top secret file about Sydnew Bristow, dated 1976, was instead about the very recent killing of Irina Derevko. Huh? Someone needs to teach the CIA how to properly title and date files. That is the first of numerous disappointments in season 4, and I suppose it's good that they get such a stinker out of the way early so that you don't get any more hopes up.

The credibility of the series is ruined when the writers place super-villian Arvin Sloane in charge of a black-ops CIA unit. I mean seriously, when is the CIA just going to shoot this guy in the face and get it over with? Is this the 3rd of 4th time the U.S. government places Sloane in some great position of power after it's revealed that he's a terrorist of the highest order? I don't know, I've lost track.

Worse than the sheer stupidity of the U.S. government placing Sloane in charge is the reaction of all the key characters of the show. Remember how Sloane blew up Dixon's wife? Well Dixon is all smiles as he willingly subjugates himself to his new boss Sloane. It's the same with all the characters, and in one fell swoop it destroys the entire credibility of the series.",1159660800,9,1757,4.518867924528302

2369691,2,B000A6T2BW,"We all know that the first 2 seasons of Alias were brilliant.  Season 3 is where things get tricky when it comes to audience reactions: a lot of viewers were very unhappy with it.  Sadly, season 4 is what happens when a show's producers bend over backwards to give the fans what they want-- it's contrived and predictable, a sad rehash of season 1.

What it boils down to is that Alias tried to reinvent itself, to evolve, which I think is refreshing.  Season 3 literally flips Sydney's world upside down: Sloan is a good guy, Vaughn is married to someone else, her friends are gone.  It was risky, but brilliant, and in the end audiences just couldn't handle it.  So, to make them happy, the show did a 180 and headed right back to season 1.  In the first episode of season 4, Syd gets assigned to an elite black-ops unit within the CIA.  Much to her, and my, chagrin, she soon learns that the unit is made up of all the main charaacters of the show, and is led my Sloan.  This moment was the first in all of the episodes I'd seen of Alias that made me jump out of my seat with a dismayed ""you've got to be kidding!"".  So, with this one super-contrived move, Alias was back where it started, with Syd working to protect the world under the supervision of a man that cannot be trusted.  Syd and spy daddy aren't speaking, again, and Syd and Vaughn are together for the whole season even though that doesn't really mean anything because, as any TV fan should know, relationships without conflict are boring.

Season 1 was great because it was fresh and original, but no one can deny that it was nonetheless pretty formulaic.  Every episode a new mission, a new countermission, and a new wig.  In order to survive, the show had to evolve, which it did bravely.  Unfortunately, the fans wanted to return to the formula, and the writers followed their commands.  The result is the most boring season of Alias ever and, as it were, the cancellation of the show.",1149292800,6,1956,4.421787709497207
2369692,4,B000A6T2BW,"The third season of Alias was quite entertaining but there was a certain unremarkable thing about it. Not that it was a bad season but season 2 was so knee-deep in awesomeness that the third would most likely look kind of less than thrilling. Season 4 is certainly its most unbelievable and a bit silly at times but it was fun nonetheless.

Each season has had a reboot of sorts from the takedown of SD-6 in season 2, the 2 year later thing from season 3 and now Sydney Bristow is now working for APO: Authorized Personnel Only, working with her dad, boyfriend and many friends. Only it's headed by Arvin Sloane, the evil guy that she's been so determined to take down. Plus there's more additions: Nadia Santos, introduced last season as Sydney's half-sister and another APO agent.

Having Nadia on missions with Sydney has a weird dynamic duo feeling to it all which is extremely cool to have. 2 hot spies fighting to save the world and looking cute doing it never gets old. It's also quite funny in a lot of parts and it's certainly helpful for character moments. Many will roll their eyes at seeing someone like Sloane the head of an off-the-books group and it does make you question why someone wouldn't just shoot the guy as soon as they saw him.

One thing that doesn't help with season 4 was ABC's insistence that the episodes wouldn't be as story-arc intensive as previous seasons, fearing viewers would lose interest if they ever missed a night. So the episodes are just that, very episodic in nature with problem in the show and solved by episode's end. There is another addition to the untrustworthy Derevko family and it's certainly a great addition especially since Katya barely shows up and Irina makes what could be considered a big guest starring role rather than a big season player.

That being said there is some great episodes on here including a trip into Sloane's mind who may not be as bad as he seems, a look into Jack's mind using some time messing withs and a look into Nadia's backstory. The whole thing about another Arvin Sloane is quite funny(and oddly eerie when you watch him) but it does create a ""oh come on, yeah right!"" type of reaction.

It's pretty easy to say this season is better than season 3 but like I said season 3 was enjoyable, it just wasn't as focused as it should be. Season 4 got it backwards too as there was kind of a focus but the intrigue seemed missing and with a show like Alias that's a big misstep but I mean this season does have Mia Maestro so what's not to love?",1148774400,,2525,4.480434782608696
2369693,3,B000A6T2BW,"This was a very disjointed season, with too many stand-alone epis and not enough cohesiveness between storylines.  Word on the street is that ABC made them show the epis out of order so that the ""good"" ones would air during sweeps and such nonsense.

Below you will see the order that the episodes aired in (which is also their order on these DVD's) followed by the title and the number on the right is the order it SHOULD have aired.

A twisted family tale of love, and espionage - cool wigs, hot action, exotic locals, mystery, excitement, and great characters to study and love.

Many of the stand-alones brought us closer to specific characters - ""In dreams"" (Sloane), ""Mirage"" (Jack), ""Ice"" (Vaughn), ""Detene"" / ""The Index"" / ""Orphan"" (Nadia)... and so on.

Arvin Sloane, convicted of treason - a terrorist, a traitor to the US, a mass murderer - is placed in charge of an elite anti-terrorist agency.  And, the people he directly betrayed have to work for him.  Sure, that makes sense.  I'm sure that if the US government captures Osama bin Laden, they will place him in charge of the CIA - since he has ""connections"".  Oh - but they will keep an eye on that wily Osama!

The show still has good Mission Impossible-style action, and Syndey's sister is a good addition to the show.  I've had to force myself a bit to get through this season, unlike previous seasons where I could watch several episodes in one sitting.  It is great that the producers want to take the show in a different direction, with something we don't see all the time.  I'm expecting Syndey's next love interest to be Saddam Hussein.

In my opinion, this particular season is good, but it's not the best yet.  I found myself able to second guess things before they actually happened; but, if you've watched the show from the beginning, you'd be able to do the same.  I think that goes for any show, really (although Lost still blows my mind).

The episodes definitely get better as they progress.  I highly suggest watching the entire season from beginning to end so that you have enough of the backstory to see the final episode.  It's one ending I did not see coming!  My head is still spinning.

Oh, and the extras are pretty funny.  I always love the blooper reels and anything to do with Marshall 'cause he's hilarious!",1138492800,3,857,4.464516129032258
2369743,3,B000A6T2BW,"I'm an admittedly big fan of ""Alias,"" so you'll probably have to take some of my comments with a grain of salt. Season Four, for the most part, is likeable and fun, suffering only in comparison to the heights the series reached in its first two years. Even though ""Alias"" creator J.J. Abrams seems to have run out of ideas regarding the series, he's established the characters and situations well-enough so that series can continue on sheer momentum for a while.

This season, like every other season, focuses on the adventures of a small group of CIA agents who work together. Despite the opening credits' insistence on the importance of series star Jennifer Garner, this season is more a team effort than ever before. There's Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), who's a multilinguist and a master of disguise. There's her love interest Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), a decent straight-arrow of an agent troubled by his recent past. There's her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber), who is alternately grim and emotionally unavailable, and her step-sister Nadia (Mia Maestro). They're led by the enigmatic Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), a former CIA agent who turned into both a terrorist and a criminal mastermind similar to a James Bond villain and now claims to have been reformed. Sydney has a long history with Sloane, as does the rest of her team. As if to prove that you don't have to be part of Sydney's inner circle to work for the CIA, the remainder of the team (all in subordinate roles) include a geeky comic relief computer genius named Marshall, a strong experienced backup agent named Dixon, and a formerly occassional guest character promoted to series regular named Weiss, who serves mainly as comedy relief as well as Nadia's love interest. The cast is uniformly strong; as Nadia, Mia Maestro does the best she can with a character that isn't all that well-developed.

Abrams constructed the first third of the season to consist of self-contained episodes with a minimum of character development and next to no continuity. I'm assuming that this was intended to make it easier for new viewers to become interested in the series. These episodes reminded me a lot of the 1960s ""Mission Impossible"" series so perhaps it isn't surprising to learn that Abrams is working on the latest MI movie. I enjoyed these episodes a lot although I was disheartened by both the lack of continuity and absence of an overall story arc.

All this changes with the remainder of Season Four, in which Abrams not only returns to the extended story arc of earlier seasons, but also revives the Tomb Raider-meets-DaVinci Code obsession Arvin Sloane has for the Renaissance megalomaniac named Milo Rambaldi. We are treated to a series of implausible but hugely entertaining vignettes involving radiation poisoning, a woman from the past manipulating Nadia's feelings, an Arvin Sloane imposter nicknamed ""Arvin Clone,"" and a Rambaldi doomsday scenario that would not seem out of place in a George Romero movie.

Why can't I rank this DVD set higher? It's tough to follow the ending of the season if you aren't already a fan, for starters. If you are a fan, you're likely to be annoyed at the seemingly endless succession of stand alone episodes at the beginning of the season. You'll also be disappointed in the revisionist treatment Abrams thrusts upon the occassional ""guest villains"" from earlier seasons, as well as the almost total lack of big-name guest stars in comparison to earlier seasons. You'll wonder why Abrams does next to nothing to further the Sydney-Vaughn relationship, and marvel at the almost total lack of chemistry between Nadia and Weiss.

Season Four of ""Alias"" has all the high-tech espionage, stunning stunt coordination, excellent music, and top-notch cinematography as previous seasons. (Indeed, it's far more enjoyable than most of the recent 007 films!) It's lacking much of the emotional impact of the first two seasons however, and I strongly suggest you begin your ""Alias"" obsession elsewhere. This isn't bad TV by any means; it just isn't up the the earlier seasons' standards.",1137283200,26,4099,5.022058823529412
2369744,3,B000A6T2BW,"I just finished Season 4 of Alias.  I have been waiting with great anticipation ever since I heard Lena Olin was coming back.  I must admit it was nice to have Irina back, but Season 4 is no Season 2.  Season 4 was a mixed bag, with some clever twists in place - but all too often riding the same mediocre wave that carried Season 3.  I've been following the series on DVD ever since Season 1 hooked me.  Its likely what's kept me coming back.

In addition to the return of Irina(which was far too short-lived), we also got ""The Clone"" which was acutally on par with some of the former seasons' ""didn't see that coming"" moments.  The plot line of the final two episodes was a bit of a letdown, contributing to that whole Season 3 vibe.  All in all, I will buy Season 5, if for no other reason to give JJ and crew a chance to redeem themselves and possibly return us to the glory of the early days.  I'd like to think this won't be our parting moments with Irina.",1136851200,2,962,4.1567567567567565
2369745,3,B000A6T2BW,"I've watched every episode now since season 1 episode 1.

Alias is a 5-star series, but as a long-time fan, I'd say this was a 3-star year.

For those new to Alias, I'd suggest you start with season 1.  It's an extremely well-done series.  Very engaging.  Each episode is gripping, well acted, with plenty of action, Bond-like gadetry, tremendous effects, etc.  Across any season, it has an overall story arc that holds together and keeps you coming back and wanting to see the episodes in order.  It's not quite as tightly dependent as, say, 24.  But the episodes work better in order than they do individually.  It's a great show to watch while you exercise -- the workout flies by.

Alias has an overall plot that, if I explained it, would simply sound ridiculous (like Lost or 24 et al), but the good acting actually sells it and allows you to get caught up in the story and suspend disbelief.  At least enough to have fun with the show.

But for those familiar with Alias who enjoyed Seasons 1-3, you may be disappointed with Season 4.

It starts out very weak.  I almost stopped watching after half a dozen episodes.  The premise of the year seemed strained.  And the episodes were very mission-oriented, stand-alone without an overall storyline in my view.  I frankly felt that the team must have been distracted by launching Lost and just weren't giving this enough time to make it a good story anymore.  Acting and effects remain solid, but the intertwined twisting plot that we had come to expect got... lost.

Things picked back up though in the 2nd half of the season, and caused it to finish reasonably well.

For a long time fan, it's worth seeing, but it's just not as good as prior years have been.  The reason for the dropoff in viewership is pretty evident in my view.

In a nutshell:

- If you haven't seen any Alias, buy Season 1 first

- If you like Alias a lot, get this, but lower your expectations from prior years -- it is still entertaining though, and the cast remains terrific.

- If your time is limited, get Lost Season 1 instead.",1136764800,5,2060,4.517615176151762
2369746,4,B000A6T2BW,"After finishing the final disc of this season, i felt a great dissapointment and sadness as i realized that the show is far from what it once was. The storyline remains the most important thing so i'll try not to reveal anything, though when reading most of the other reviews it's hard not to ruin yourself most of the surprises.

So here i go:

After 3 years of great TV, despite a few mistakes and wrong turns here and there, Alias entered its fourth season wanting to regain the audience lost in the last season. And the new structure of the episodes manged to attract more viewers, at one HUGE, WRONG, DESTRUCTIVE sacrifice, the storyline. You're watching the episode and listening "" this new weapon could wipe out an ecosystem....you must get it back and stop the terrorists from using it."" And then you think: wasn't this in the last episode? No, last time it was a bomb, and the time before it was a chemical weapon, and before that a new weapon, and before that a new defense technology...etc.etc...  Every episode is almost the same! (except for the final ones, but i'll get to them later). However, i'm not saying the episodes are bad, the missions are better than before, longer more realistic, Marshall no longer makes everything happen. Sydney and the gang have use oldschool tricks.

Towards the middle of the season, the shows begins to show faint signs of a storyline, despite this, the level of excitement remains as low and you then continue to the ussual ""terrorist"" episodes. it is until the final episodes that the story takes hold and doesn't let go, but it is not as strong as past seasons for this very reason, it all happens in a short time and you don't understand what happens until the final episodes when everyhting is explained, including what happened to nadia and sloane at the end of the 3rd season. Besides, big plus here, you finally get to know what is the goddamn red ball from season 1 for.

So, if the missions are good, and you get some explanation from past misteries, why do i say it is horrible for die hard fans? Well the answer is the lack of a continuing storyline, in past seasons, each episode flowed nicely into the next, however, like lost, the next episode may have nothing to do with the past one. This new way of presenting the storyline creates a whole different Alias, wich fans may not see as a better one, like i did.

Secondly, the storyline only answers misteries from the 3rd season, not progressing much, not moving moving forward (this is most obvious when in the final episodes a series of flashbacks from different characters appear to explain the past). Therefore, i see season 4 only as closure for the past season. Finally the season finale, though interesting, was most different from the past ones. It felt more like a superhero movie where the villain is about to destroy the world with his evil creation and the good guy has to stop him before its too late. You'll see for yourselves if you buy it. Also, the twists and turns are getting old and predictable, much like 24's i could see the surprises a mile away! It's getting boring when the bad guy says he is good again blablablabl and we all know how that turns out later.

So...yes i recommend it to new viewers, fans may find the final episodes to be the only interesting ones. Nevertheless, i feel i owe it to the show to continue watching the 5th season,and if you are a fan too you may feel you have to watch this season, but don't expect too much. I didn't and i felt dissapointed anyway.",1136332800,6,3518,4.530708661417322
2369747,3,B000A6T2BW,"Season 2 of Alias did what few TV shows have ever achieved: it told a long-running story without clumsy repetition of plot-points for viewers who missed the last episodes; and it maitained consistency and plot integrity throughout. The episode where SD-6 is finally taken down is one of the most powerful and dramatic television shows ever aired.

Which is why, by comparison, Season 4 is halfway to chickening out on us. As an attempt to draw in new viewers, the show's producers and writers gave us a whole bunch of self-contained episodes in the first half of the season. They're all fine in themselves, but for the fan-base that turns up to see the big plot unfolding, they're frustrating entries in the series.

Though things pick up in the second half of the season, there's still two fundamental problems. First, Alias seems to be suffering from character inbreeding. We now have Sydney's mother, two aunts, half-sister, father, fiance and her sister's father in play. Sure, it's all integral to the plot, and there's even some poking fun at itself in some lines in the final episodes, but is it necessary? And does it make us think a little too much of daytime soapies.

Secondly, the requirement to bring characters back from the dead is forcing more and more unweildy explanations from the writers. We've had Francie in the earlier seasons, resurrected as a double, then the double resurrected. Sydney's mother Irina has come back from the dead twice. Even Sydney's old Russian enemy Anna crawls out of the grave for a Season 4 cameo.

Using resurrection as a plot twister is not only tricky from a plot perspective, it's also not very new, or very exciting. When Dallas put Bobby Ewing in the shower, they pulled about the most desperate act of resurrection imaginable. By comparison, Alias's body-doubling machines and miracle recoveries from multiple bullet wounds just seems a bit lazy, frankly.

Ditto, for problem 2-and-a-half, for the near deaths. Poor old Dixon takes another one for the team this season. How are we meant to care whether someone gets shot if they have no chance of actually dying. What happened to the courage to really wipe out key characters like Francie or Emily Sloane?

Still, as an Alias fan, the last 8 or so episodes made the season worthwhile, and it is good to have Lena Olin back. Ron Rifkin's performance is especially good this season, even though I would far rather have the evil Sloane back for good.

The cliffhanger suffers from all the problems mentioned above. If the characters can't die...well, you get the picture. I just wonder if the director got the treatment idea from The Forgotten, which appalling as it was, had one great scene: the car accident.

Looking forward as ever to the next Season, and hoping for some big risks and some characters not in Syd's family.",1136073600,4,2827,4.8264462809917354
2369748,2,B000A6T2BW,"All told, your enjoyment of Season 4 will depend on your opinion of Season 3. If you loved Season 3, then good news, this is more of the same. If you didn't enjoy Season 3, then bad news, this is more of the same.

I loved the first two seasons of Alias, but for me the series suffered greatly in the third season from bad writing and lost focus. What I enjoyed about the first two seasons was that Alias was fresh and did something that few shows dare to do, that is, combine show to show action with arching themes and a long-term plot. Alias was also never scared to effect change by killing off a character or changing the fundamentals of it the show, which was refreshing.

Season 3 suffered because it all became trite. You can only goat your audience into thinking a character was dead, just to bring them back, so many times before it gets extremely dull. Season 4 continues to get worse because instead of changing the show into something better and fresher, they're back to square one. Season 4 takes place with Slone running a covert ops unit AGAIN, he's suspected of being evil AGAIN, and Syndey and Vaughn must work together to save the world and stop him from whatever he may be up to AGAIN. The writing also continues to get worse with the characters all becoming more two dimensional as the season goes on.

On the up side, if you had no problems with Season 3, then the quality continues to stay the same (which, regardless of whether you like or dislike it, is better than most of what's on TV) and there are enough plot twists, fresh ideas, and action scenes to keep you glued to the tube.

In short, if you loved Seasons 1 & 2, but thought that 3 was a let down, then you're in for a real disappointment. If you loved 3, then 4 should be on your list.",1135814400,3,1771,4.293413173652695
2369749,5,B000A6T2BW,"After a good but somehow off third season, especially after the majestic first two seasons, Alias' fourth season was somewhat of a question mark going in.  The decision for the first half of the fourth season to comprise stand-alone episodes, with little regard to previous continuity, further suggested a series without a guiding vision.  However, around the mid-point of the season, the episodes began to cohere and a narrative drive really began to kick in.  It's not quite as good as the series was at it its best, but I must confess I felt like an old friend had returned.  By the end, I was grinning, having a blast, in love again.  I had written the series off but I feel like it bounced back remarkably.  I'm so very pleased.",1134777600,3,733,4.6
2369750,3,B000A6T2BW,"I agree largely with the review below by Miss V. Unlike some viewers, I see nothing wrong with season 3 - I enjoyed it just as much as the other seasons, and believe it to be almost as perfect. However, it is obvious that in season 4 Alias' mastermind, J.J. Abrams, has given much creative control to ""new writers"", as quoted in an article. Season 4 had Alias change its entire format into something very un-Alias - procedural, stand alone episodes that are so unsatisfying to an audience accustomed to great serial drama. However, looking back on the season, I must say that the stand alone episodes couldn't have been better done given their series' context, and the ongoing story arc that developed later in the season was more disappointing in its lack of intelligence and underachievement. The worst thing I witnessed was the seeming ending of the heart of Alias - the Rambaldi saga - in a way that is totally undeserving of so ingenious a storyline. Don't get me wrong, there were moments of the season with as much excitement and emotion as those wonderful seasons past, but not nearly as much. Watch it, but know it is a only a mere shadow of a once great show.",1134432000,2,1169,4.571428571428571
2369751,1,B000A6T2BW,"I am really, really surprised that the fans aren't being harder on Alias 4, I thought it was a major let down. I don't agree that Season 3 was so bad - it had less pace than 1 or 2 and an inferior season finale, but the two big revelations - finding out where Syd was for two years, and the 'reveal' that Lauren was a baddie - were genuinely compelling and exciting, and the tension in the Syd-Vaughn-Lauren triangle was a great idea. In Season 4, you have the 'Moonlighting' problem - once the will they-won't they couple get together, all the romantic tension dies. Other problems: the is-Sloane-evil flip-flopping ceased to be interesting a long time ago, and the premise that Syd - who's been almost solely motivated by a need to bring down Sloane for how long? - is suddenly prepared to work for him to 'keep an eye' on him is weak to say the least. Nadia is a dull, two-dimensional character whose only dramatic potential is to create conflict between Syd and Sloane, but that isn't pursued, beyond Syd being a bit snappy with him now and then. (He murdered my fiance and best mate...but what the hell, lets go to his house for dinner if it's your *birthday*!) Nadia's relationship with Weiss starts and then fades away as a sub plot the writers seem to lose interest in. The 'well-known actor' cameo episodes which worked so well in 2 are a wash-out (Scottish Kelly MacDonald with that bloke from the coffee ads doing an Irish accent as her brother...eh?) the APO set has no atmosphere and uber-villains Sark and Anna Espinoza turn up and then disappear again to no effect. Oh yeah, and why isn't Lauren's body a bit more mouldy by now? Does the CIA preserve the corpses of the people they cover up shooting? And the Derevko sister revelation is dull dull dull. She bothered to run an orphanage undercover for years just to win Nadia's trust? I'm sorry, I loved Alias, but the hokey ending, turning Vaughn into someone else as they scrape the bottom of the shocking-twists barrel, just confirmed the shark has been jumped. JJ Abrams' distraction with other projects probably played a major part - the same thing happened with Angel when Joss Whedon went off to do other things. All I hope for with 5 is that they put the show out of its misery in an entertaining manner.",1134259200,8,2277,4.529126213592233

2369783,4,B000A6T2BW,"I have been a fan of ALIAS since season 1.  I do not live in the US so I had to wait until March each year to get the full dose of the season.  All 22 episodes back to back for 22 weeks, something experienced in the US with season 3.

Like other reviewers season 1 and 2 were excellent.  I agree with the weak points of season 3, but it was actually good.  In a sense we say Jack's live through Michael's relationship with Lauren.  I LOVE the idea of Sydney and Michael not being together.  Like other shows when the prime characters get together the show suffers..

Here my complain with S4... What of the papers that Syd read at the end of season 3.. they touched the point of her being a subject in one of Jack's projects, and then come up with him killing Irina.. I did not buy it Also I did not like the idea of the two together, but we did not see them together too much..  I love the ending of season 4 and even more the idea of Nadia in a coma.  SORRY!! for those of you that like her.. I did not..  Too much family.. and a daughter of Sloane.. a good person.. oh please!!  if they wanted a sibling.. give her Sark.. that would have been wonderful but also predictable.

Touching about the possible betrayal of Michael.. look closely at S3... they touch the point of psychological conditioning, and he knew too much about Rambaldi without clear explanations, and Irina told him to come clean with Syd... You have to watch the episodes on DVD and all the answers are there.

MY MAJOR COMPLAIN:  I do not like the DVD sets very much.  They lack major things, that you find in others.. PERFECT example the Buffy DVD sets they are full of goodies, chapter selection, commetaries in episodes and others.  I have all 4 ALIAS sets and they are very poor on the extra departments.. But I will gladly purchase season 5 next year and so on.

2369785,4,B000A6T2BW,"I was one of the fans who open-mindedly watched season 4 as the episodes premiered on ABC, but found myself disappointed. Like many others, I felt the show was not what it used to be. What compelled me most to watch the show, particularly in seasons 1 and 2 were the intense cliffhanger endings. I loved the way all the episodes connected, the amount of shocking moments that left your mouth on the floor. As I watched season four, I felt cheated when there weren't many of these moments. The first seven episodes were self-contained, without an overall villain to tie the stories together. I watched the entire season and enjoyed certain scenes in the show, but wasn't thrilled with it as a series.

Nevertheless, being a huge Alias fan, I felt I owed the show a second viewing... and I have to admit, there was something missing the second time around that was there originally: the high expectations.

The truth is that season four was trying to go somewhere new, but I didn't follow the show to those places because I was so insistant in making the show what it used to be. Once that had been lifted and I saw the season as a whole, everything seemed to make more sense, and it became so much better.

For starter, I had originally expected season four to pick up right where season three left off, the way the other two season premiers had done in the past. Rather then waiting for the questions to be answered right away, it was best to just enjoy the episode for what it was: the introduction of APO, the new unit Sydney was placed to work at. This new agency allowed everyone to go to missions they may not have otherwise done had they still worked for the CIA.

Secondly, it's better watching the show when you have no expectations of old cast members showing up again. Forget about Will, Francine/Allison, Lauren, even Irina Derevko coming back. Season four was not about shocking its audience. It was about building stronger storylines and plots.

Remember that this season premiered in January, in the middle of the regular TV season. This was done to please the fans who were complaining of ""no-episode-AGAIN-this-week"" hysteria. Almost all 22 episodes were shown consecutively throughout the five months. Because ""Desperate Housewives"" became such a hit, Alias' original Sunday at 9 time slot was unavailable, so they placed the show after ""Lost."" This was a great move because it allowed for a bigger follow-up audience, so self-contained episodes was a smart idea to not confuse the new audience right away. Once a steady audience was established, Alias picked up with its long-termed plot toward the second half of the season. It not only dealt with the recurring themes of the show's past three seasons, but it finally answered a lot of its questions and fullfilled some of its prophecies.

If you've never seen season four, the above may not even apply. It's always better to be able to watch a show at your own pace, because those expectations are always lowered. If you don't like an episode, you don't have to wait a whole week reflecting on it to catch the next one.

Either way, season four of Alias is definitely worth watching, especially those who weren't crazy about it the first time. The special features are also a great plus, especially the gag reel and the ""Marshall's World"" featurette... plus Jennifer Garner in the commentaries of the first two episodes is hillarious.

I hope you enjoy it the way I did... but remember that if you don't get it, you won't be able to enjoy Marshall and the spork. :-)",1131580800,4,3536,4.6827697262479875

Fans of Alias season 1 through 3 will find the same fast paced, cliff-hanging suspense, adventure and action they have come to love and expect. Season Four delivers all of that, and more, with many surprises and twists of its own.

I won't go into detail on the brilliance of the show as other reviewers have covered that ground thoroughly. I will however point out that JJ needs to take a leaf out of Joss Whedon's book and make sure that his writers pay proper attention to the mythology he has put in place. In Season 3 Vaughn finds out what the prophecy concerning ""The Passenger"" is and warns Sydney not to go after her. He very clearly says ""The Passenger and the Chosen One will clash. They will do great battle and neither will survive"". All of a sudden in Season 4 the writers seem to have magically decided to alter this prophecy saying that when nadia and sydney battle only one shall survive!!!???!!! To conveniently disregard previously put in place mythology shows little regard for long time fans of the show. I still give it 5 stars because it is quite simply the source of the best entertainment on TV along with Lost.",1131494400,,1048,4.579787234042553

2369789,2,B000A6T2BW,"Taking any single season of Alias into account, one's left with the idea that this is a fairly OK show.  The minute you throw another season into the mix you realize that Alias is mostly pretty bad - suffering from a multitude of flaws that are impossible to overcome.

Alias wants to pass itself off as a serious show but doesn't want to do any of the heavy lifting that is required in keeping a multi-season show serious.  Most of the problem seems to be that the first season introduced a cast that succeeded in pulling the show off and now the producers don't want to change that cast-formula.  The result is that characters, which logically should have been out of the series two seasons ago, keep coming back via progressively absurd plot devices.  Subsequently the audience is forced to watch the same conflict arguments between main characters over and over and over again every couple of episodes.

Another problem has to do with the writers introducing genuinely compelling ideas and plot twists and then completely dropping them, unresolved.  More than once the audience is left sitting three episodes later thinking, ""Hey!  What ever happened to.....?""  Some of these unresolved plots go on for several episodes before they mysteriously disappear.

Probably the biggest problem in the series has to do with everyone involved in the show being lazy and re-using the same directorial choices over and over again.  Each season seems to have at least one or two ""Climax at the start then cut to 3 days earlier"" episodes.  And how many times do we need to see the female characters strutting their stuff, slow-motion, through some posh or grungy night club before THAT gets old?

Also, the writers fall back on the ""Brief mission.  Start mission.  Screw up mission.  Save screwed up mission"" formula far too often.

On a personal level, I don't find Garner a believable actor or sympathetic character but many of the actors around her are excellent and make up for her weakness.",1130630400,11,1985,4.84272997032641
2369790,5,B000A6T2BW,"Things are once again changing in Sydney's world.  She has been recruited to join a new black ops unit of the CIA.  Called APO (short for Authorized Personnel Only), Syd's thrilled to be part of the exclusive team.  Until she meets her new boss.  Sloan has not only been pardoned, but he's in charge of the new unit.  On the plus side, all her friends are part of the team, which means she'll have lots of help making sure Sloan is really on the up and up.  Also joining them is Sydney's half sister Nadia.  Their missions, while dangerous, seem fairly routine, until hints begin to emerge that there is a greater danger afoot.  Is Sloan up to his old Rimbaldi tricks?  Or is someone from Sydney and Nadia's family tree behind the trouble?

After season three, I was hoping the show would get back on track, and with this season it did.  The set-up feels a little too much like they were trying to recreate the first season magic, and that's just not going to happen.  But they did do a good job of telling great stories over the course of the season.

Many fans didn't like the first third, which were mainly stand alone episodes with hints of a plot thread moving through them.  Personally, I found them just as engrossing as the regular episodes.  By the mid point of the season, things are beginning to gel with the storyline about Vaughn's father taking the forefront.  The last third was another can't miss thrill ride that ended with the end of the world - almost - and the best cliffhanger of the series.  Although I really wish they'd dump the Rimbaldi storyline already.  That's the one aspect of the show I've never liked.

This six disc set continues the great season DVD sets this series has already been given.  All twenty-two episodes are presented in full surround and wide screen, looking better then originally aired.  Four episodes get commentaries by members of the cast and crew, which are always fun and informative.  There are the usual deleted scenes and bloopers as well as a profile of new cast member Mia Maestro, an interview with Jennifer Garner, director's diary, info on Marshall's gadgets, and other behind the scenes featurettes.

While I don't think this show will ever regain the magic of its first season, this season was still well worth watching.  In many ways, it could stand alone, although watching from the first episode would certainly help understand all the relationships and nuances.  This is still one of my favorite TV shows currently on the air.",1130198400,4,2494,4.6521739130434785
2369791,3,B000A6T2BW,"`Alias' continues to be a fun show this season. One should, however, keep in mind that fun in the form of cool gadgets, imaginative scenarios and creative stunts was always complementary, if not peripheral, to the compelling relationships, and their implications on and revelations pertaining to the plot's characters, during the first three seasons, and ask if that was the case this time.

Arvin Sloane, Irina Derafko and Jack Bristow keep things interesting. They're nicely ambivalent characters whose actions, decisions and words always detract from any expectations that the show's audience is tempted to settle on at the risk of simplifying their motivations and the psychology behind their choices. Four seasons in, and even up to that concluding moment when Sydney seems to finally allow herself to hope for something good in Sloane, the idea that Sloane could have become a simple father figure just screams `diminution of character' inside my head.

Lauren was a disappointment in the third season. Naturally, when new characters are introduced, the audience almost instinctively becomes suspicious of them - the result of some clever hardwiring on the part of the writers. However, all manner of intrigue about Vaughn's wife was promptly extinguished as a result of the writers and directors simply turning the tables too hard on us. Sloane becoming a dubious philanthropist was a surprising and subtly suggestive, but ultimately opaque, change of predicament for the show's signature villain, and genuinely kept you guessing at his end game (which, I might add, Season Four still reveals almost nothing about explicitly). Lauren, however, quickly became bland when she was revealed to simply be a dominatrix, seemingly harmless in desk-job office wear - a match in treachery to Julian Sark, whose enigmatic winsomeness and shady elusiveness her character couldn't emulate, rendering her all the less interesting.

Nadia in Season Four suffers the same fate for a similar reason: All manner of possibility and tension about her, built up in a riveting close to the third season and an excellent opening half to this, was defused by way of some frustratingly convenient turns of plot. It would have been utterly gripping if Sydney and Nadia had, in fact, confronted each other over Jack Bristow and his supposedly murdering their mother. However, not only does Jack tell Nadia the truth in a scene of incredibly flat revelation, but, also, what do Sydney and Nadia ultimately fight over? In the words of Eleanor, `a bit of tap water'. There was no meaningful cause to that conflict (which, by the by, was lazily choreographed in my opinion - Francine's clone was, no doubt, more formidable), and all the anticipation generated from Sydney's discovery of what her mother knew became lost - just like that.

What I found to be the weakest link to this season, ironically, was the leading lady herself. Whereas she was energetic and very convincing in her performance in the first three seasons, alternating competently between vehemence and vulnerability (especially when she cried - went all the way, you could tell), here the second half of the season was an exhibition of plain lazy acting on her part (yes - we find ourselves in a room with a nuclear coil, and we say, `Yeah - it's getting a little hot in here.'). She showed a great deal of promise in the first half actually - I thought she did `hapless' and `distraught' very well when she was under the influence of that suspicious substance that messes with your perception - but everything went downhill from `Nightingale' onwards. She didn't deserve that Emmy nomination this year. Trust the Academy to overlook understated talent from Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin (the latter did the hypnotisation scene wonderfully - a yearning for some manner of peace done without self-consciousness, thus making Sloane, for a moment, somehow smaller, yet sympathetically so). Really it's the old timers that keep the show from tumbling into vapidity.

I had an issue with pay-offs from this season as well. There comes a time, the producers must realise, when the danger in situations conceived doesn't become convincing anymore - somehow, someway, our favourite characters always manage to get away. It takes creativity, therefore, and the writers' trademark, inspired sense of originality to consistently create a genuine sense of danger. They still managed that through Season Three, but there were a lot of letdowns in this one. They could have done so much with `Liberty Village' but settled for a deux ex machina sort of ending that saw one small device conveniently blowing up the sole (read: ONE) helicopter that came for Sydney and Vaughn. And while Sydney did `paranoid gal' very well - `It's my father - I think I killed him'? Nah - didn't buy into it one moment.

But you see I have a soft spot for `Alias' (damn you J.J.). I love the camerawork in this season and the treatment of the film - brooding noir-ish tones that embrace shadows and eschew the slick psychedelia of previous seasons, giving Number Four an apposite, unnervingly languid mood for what still is a potent tale of espionage. Michael Giacchino's score seems to have found a similarly inspired turn, and this season's soundtrack attains real form as a proper (well, almost at least) body of work, instead of a patchy collection of themes.

This season really pushes the envelope of otherwise inconceivable, Bond similarities - situations that would be ridiculous in another show, gadgets too sophisticated to be available so easily - but the cast, somehow, still manages to pull off the outrageous premise and make it work (or, at least, make me buy into it). In a sense it works like that other J.J. Abrams baby `Lost' - that everyone escapes with only mild cuts and scratches is unbelievable, but he quickly reminds you that that's not the point.

And, of course, one might say that this whole season is worth owning for its last few moments alone. Again, I thought there'd be a bigger pay-off from stopping Eleanor's plot (we all see the rather indiscreet parallels to `Dawn of the Dead' here - giant red ball and sanguinary idiots instead of animate zombies), and it's precisely because of that that I really, really hope that the Rembaldi storyline doesn't end just like that (Sydney - the only one who could stop `true evil'? Didn't feel like that great a triumph to me). But for a while I thought this could be the cliffhanger that dwarfed all the others before - brilliantly executed (both technically and in terms of the emotional modulation), and so unnerving again because it's a revelation made so matter-of-factly and calmly, which makes its disruption all the more abrupt and rude (who's to say, really, that it was an accident?).

So yes - I'm still staying for Season Five. But with you-know-who's death, Garner better do `hapless' and `distraught' well enough to carry the next season.",1129075200,11,6939,4.9956747404844295

The finale, with the clash of Derevko sisters Irina and Elaina could only have been improved if they'd managed to bring in Katya as well.  The interactions of Jack and Irina alone makes this a season worth watching, and the cliffhanger at the end with Syd and Vaughn was really well done!

2369807,3,B000A6T2BW,"I'll say what I said for the Season 3 set: I love 'Alias' and have religiously watched every episode from day one. I have actively tried to sell my friends on it for years. And when they finally start watching (beacuse they liked 'Lost' and it's made by the same guy) it's Season 4. Oy.

Yes, Season 3 was a slight drop in quality from the first two glorious seasons. But Season 4 practically fell off a cliff, especially in the first half.

In order to retain the audience from J.J. Abrams' new baby, 'Lost,' 'Alias' was retooled to reintroduce the characters, drop the backstory, and make each episode self-contained. In other words, the arcs being followed by fans of the first three seasons were dumped to keep everyone from changing the channel when Locke and company signed off each week. For good measure, beautiful leading ladies Jennifer Garner and Mia Maestro were teamed in skimpy outfits so that promos sprinkled throughout 'Lost' and Monday Night Football would reel in Joe Sixpack. I was surprised they didn't have them kiss during sweeps.

At any rate, the pandering gave way to the preposterous when the murderous Arvin Sloane was placed in charge of the black ops division of CIA, with two spies (Syd and Dixon) reporting directly to him whose fiance, best friend, and spouse he'd had killed. This led to Sydney making several ""I don't trust you, you vile snake"" speeches that she'd already made a dozen times over the years. In my opinion, this setup absolutely gutted her character and made everything she'd learned and done over the past three years pointless. If the real Sydney and Dixon were told Sloane was their new boss, they both would have whipped out their sidearms, emptied their clips in Sloane, reloaded, made sure his head was hamburger, high-fived each other as everyone else applauded, and bought drinks for the whole gang.

Sidebar: The producers' infatuation with Ron Rifkin clouded their judgment and it mutilated the show. If they wanted to keep Sloane around for the series finale, all they had to do was keep him in prison then on the lam until time for the endgame. Using Sloane as the big bad for all five seasons was a creative crutch that kept the series from exploring new territory. Season 4 was supposedly an attempt to ""recapture"" the feel of Season 1. They failed by forcing Sloane into the mix.

At any rate, the preposterous ceded to the ridiculous when YET ANOTHER Derevko sister (of yet another ethnicity) showed up who was - surprise - a spy. If they had pulled in one more Derevko spy sister or if Jack Bristow started discovering spy brothers, I would have officially handed in my Alias Geek Badge.

The previous season's cliffhanger (which seemed to have something to do with Syd's childhood) was tossed out and turned into a cover story for Lena Olin's refusal to return to the show.

And the low point? The vampires almost win this prize but I have to go with the deadly toy helicopters.

The events leading up to Clifford the Big Red Ball threatening the world actually started to smack of the good old days. There were some interesting character-driven episodes that delved into the pasts of Jack, Arvin, and Nadia. And when Lena Olin finally showed up (however flimsy the logic), it became great. Too bad it was practically over!

Speaking of being over: I must give proper credit for the cliffhanger. It was one of the best in TV history - not so much for what it revealed (which gutted Vaughn's character) but how it did it. Bam!",1127692800,8,3494,4.696078431372549
2369808,4,B000A6T2BW,"Season 4 of Alias isn't bad at all but just like season 3, it's not as good as season 1 or 2. This one is a bit all over the place. Sydney found out that her father Jack killed her mother. So that's why she was so upset about what she found at the end of season 3. She also fakes quiting her job at the CIA, just to join a secret CIA group. With everyone she knows of course just happening to be on the team. After the death of his spy wife Lauren Reed, Vaughn and Sydney figure out where to take their relationship. Which of course leads them straight to the bedroom.

  Sydney's sister Nadia is a regular cast member now so of course she needs a love interest too. Soon sparks start to fly between Nadia and fellow agent  Weis. Although that seems to never really lead anywhere. Vaughn soon starts to get lead on that his father is still alive and gets sent on secret missions if he wants to know where to find him. He finds information that points to Sloane as the man using him. Things get strange though when they find someone else posing as Sloane. Which is the better parts of this season.

  Then we get a poor excuse to why Sydney's mom is really alive. We get a flashback showing Jack clearly shoot her in the head and her fall in water. Then Jack says, maybe she had a double make believe it was her...um ok whatever Jack. When they find her she punches him, so it must've been her he shot but how the hell is she alive ?? Then the season ends with Vaughn telling Sydney he's a spy and his name isn't Michael Vaughn. Um...yeah that really makes sense. He was looking for Michael Vaughn's father all season and was obsessed with finding him. But he's not Michael Vaughn ?? The show can try too hard to leave us cliffhanger endings. Season 1's ending was good and so was season 2's and 3 left you guessing as well. Season 4's ending though almost made me lose interest in the show.

  Otherwise this season did have some fun episodes. I like when Sydney and Vaughn go under cover as a married couple. Where they compete with spys posing as normal american couples. The best part is where they have a shoot-out at a car dealer spot and compete with another couple. Angela Bassett joining the show is a high spot as well. Since she can act and they needed a new face. The show doesn't do much with her though. Hopefully she'll get more to do in season 5. Jack gets exposed to a deadly gas to save Sydney's life. The show  gets weird when Sydney has to pose as her own mother to get secret information from Jack in-order to save his life. At least he doesn't try to have sex with her lol. Then the season finale has Sydney, her mom, sister and father teaming up to fight....zombies ?? As they set out to save the world. There's too many zombie movies these days without them being on Alias too now.  It was still entertaining and gripping but no way the shows best stuff. Which can be said about this season. Entertaining and gripping but not the best. This one was critically acclaimed too, when it's the most confused season. So shows what critics know.",1127433600,,3061,4.267702936096718

2369811,3,B000A6T2BW,"I am a huge fan of Alias. I've been addicted to this series since the opening scene of the very first episode. Having said this, it pains me to say that Alias isn't the show it used to be. Seasons 1 & 2 were fantastic; Season 3 was mediocre; and I am sad to say Season 4 was no better.

There are several reasons why Season 4 was disappointing. First of all, the writers once again completely ignored almost everything that occurred in Season 3. The Rambaldi prophecy, which consumed nearly every episode of Season 3, was only featured in a handful of episodes in Season 4. In addition, at the end of the 3rd Season, Sydney gets into a knock-down fight with Lauren, and in the process, Lauren tells Syd that they ""are both pawns in the same game"", and that Syd ""doesn't know who controls her"". In the ending scene, Syd cries as she looks at shocking documents that contain her name along with a code of ""S.A.B 47"". The season ended with Jack telling Syd that she was never supposed to have found the documents. Between Lauren's statements and Jack's warning, I concluded that Jack had done something terrible to Sydney. In Season 4, however, it was revealed that Jack had done nothing to Sydney; instead he had murdered Irena Derevko. To this day, it still hasn't been revealed as to what Lauren was talking about.

Another disappointment in Season 4 was the bland addition of Sydney's sister, Nadia, who is played by Mia Maestro. The writers, hoping to show real-life Sydney away from work, added Nadia to list of characters in an attempt to fill the void left by the Will and Francie after Season 2. Unfortuantely, Mia Maestro isn't nearly as engaging as Francie (Merrin Dungey), or Will (Bradley Cooper). Instead, her monotonous lines, and dull performances often left more to be desired.

Season 4 was also substandard in the fact that most of the episodes began with a new storyline. The days of continued storylines were all but gone in Season 4. Instead, Alias became more of a procedural drama, rather than a serialized weekly action hour. This was a big mistake for the writers/producers, since Season 4 ran uninterrupted every week of the whole season. No repeats were shown. So every week Alias could have picked up where the previous week had left off, without the viewers worrying that a repeat was approaching. Instead the writers and producers passed on such an innovation. In this aspect, Alias suddenly seemed to become a clone of Mission Impossible rather than the unique drama it once was.

Probably the most unsatisfactory aspect of Season 4 was the constant absurdity of the storylines. In the first episode, Syd agrees to once-again work for Arvin Sloan... a man that murdered both Sydney's fianc and her best friend Francie. Yeah right. I also thought it was cheap how the writers have made many of the characters bad one minute and good the next. In the beginning and middle of the season, Jack seemed to be a secret villain, but by the end of Season 4, he was good again. Always the evil-doer, Sloan suddenly becomes good at the end of the season. Then, suddenly in the season finale, Vaughn, who was always the good guy Sydney could rely upon, reveals that he is in fact bad. Can't the writers think of anything better to do than constantly rewrite the main characters? This isn't Lost!

By all accounts, Season 4 was decent. There were a few fantastic episodes such as ""Welcome to Liberty Village"" where Syd and Vaughn pose as a married couple in order to infiltrate a terrorist organization, ""Mirage"", where Syd must disguise herself as her mother to save Jack, and ""Prophet Five"", where Sydney and company must save the world from Syd's evil aunt.  Overall, however, the quality of Season 4 continued to slump. I will buy the Season 4 DVD, but I have doubts I will watch every single episode in the set. It is rumored that Season 5 will be the last for Alias. Hopefully the producers/writers can make the final year as great as the beginning... we'll see.",1126310400,18,3984,4.651988636363637
2369825,5,B000A6T2BW,"Alias started out as the best show on television in 2001. Now in 2005 it remains the best show on television. Not even the fantastic ""Lost"" or the fabulous ""Desperate Housewives"" can come close to the greatness Alias achieves time and time again.

Alias has undergone radical changes in the past two years. Season 3 was too wrapped up in a love triangle and as a result was slightly dull and aimless. Season 4 however remedied that with lots more action, a more assertive direction and re-introducing the formula that made it such a hit in the first place. Sloane as boss of a secret operational base where trust was thinly spread. Syndey and Vaughn flirting with the idea of romance and a similar working dynamic with friendly faces and importantly the Derevko name being one that is feared. Yet in its introduction of Sydneys sister Nadia and the winding relationships of all the characters trying to find their bearings after its unstable third year - it felt at times that Alias had lost focus on the thing that really makes it work. Sydney Bristow.

Yet whilst Season 4 didn't quite rank in the greatness of the shows second season; it certainly put up a bloody good fight. Yes, it didn't have the same impact as the original two years. But its action was its best ever, its story line was way more compelling than last year and its acting was Oscar worthy. The only thing that really made it any lesser than its predecessors [season three not included] was the fact that it used the modular self contained episode style to make sure it garnered viewers and the fact that the show continued to go into depth about other characters - and lost the focus on our protagonist that we need to care about her. Sydney's story is compelling and exciting, the producers should take note of this and focus on it in the shows following year[s]. Still - it was by far and wide the best thing on TV by a mile - and after watching both Lost and Desperate Housewives, two fantastic shows, I'm happy to say that Alias is still the daddy of addictive drama.

The fourth season of ""Alias"" not only featured some fantastic storyline twists and turns - but it also featured Lena Olin back as Irina Derevko; a fantastic performance from Sophia Vargas as an intruiging character and cameos from the likes of Gina Torres as the always awesome Anna Espinosa.

But Jennifer Garner is once again the real star. She dazzles and shines head and shoulders above her fantastic supporting cast. Alias may be moving away from where it began; but is that a bad thing? If it had continued following the path of its prophecies it would have burned out a long time ago - by constantly introducing new characters, ideas and themes - the show remains as fresh and exciting in every episode as it was when Sydneys red hair dye was running from her face all the way back in Fall 01.

If people whisper that Alias isn't as good as former years - then thats only a semi truth. Season 4 is probobly the shows second best season; behind only its second year. Anyone who has watched Season 2 of the show will know thats high praise. But for those dissapointed by the romantic intruige of year 3; rest assured that Season 4 is head and shoulders above last year. And then some.",1126224000,6,3235,4.523076923076923

Particularily that out of nowhere surprise cliff hanger. I

can hardly wait to see season five. Though I agree that the

best seasons were seasons one and two, I still thought that

three and four were great too. What I particularly find re-

freshing about this series is that every episode plays like

a movie, which is different from anything else I've seen on

television. The entire series is one worth watching, and I

reccommend buying the entire series as it is released. Seasons

one and two may be the best, but you get more out of a series

if you know the whole story. The acting, the characters, the

action, the storylines; all of it's really great. As much as

I love watching this show, I can hardly wait to see how it all

ends, and I for one will be buying every season, to get the

complete story. It's a story worth seeing again and again. A

show with so many surprises and twists and turns is definitely

worth watching. It's an original. This shows creator knows

what he's doing, so stick to it and watch the whole thing. It's

one of the best shows of our time, and every season is worth

2369828,3,B000A6T2BW,"Alias is one of the greatest shows ever created. It has always been totally cinematic and of thatrical quality....until now. Seasons 1 and 2 where the greatest and season three wasn't half bad. Season 4 on the other hand takes the series on a nose dive. That is if you like originality and action. Season 4 can best be described as a woman's version of Alias. Too much useless sentimentality and wasted chances. It also attempts to bring the series full circle with a return to roots. Sloan returns as the head of the newly established PNE (Private No Entry) While interesting it is ultimately a let down. I morn the passing of good television. But if you like chick flicks or wanted less suspense or action and the end of Sydney's awful season 3 hairdo...go ahead and buy this. At least her new sister is hot, makes Sydney look awfully bad....Maybe season 5 will be better. But I doubt it. Seasons 1-3 are must owns.",1125532800,4,917,4.530120481927711
2369829,3,B000A6T2BW,"The first two seasons of ""Alias"" were among the finest TV productions I've ever seen, and while the third season was a serious step down, I'd still have to rank it as a very good show.

With season four, however, the series took a real turn for the worse.  The season has no focus of any kind; there is very little emphasis on the Rambaldi plotline, and what emphasis there is turns out to be ill-formed, uninvolving, and unmemorable.  The very notion of the fourth season -- that Sydney and Jack are back working for Sloane again -- is not only implausible, it makes the series up until this point weaker.

The season is not a total waste.  There are some good episodes, and even a couple of great ones.  However, the entire cast is misused throughout most of the season, and every time you think something cool has happened that is going to kick things into high gear, the next episode backs off and refuses to develop into anything siginificant.

It's still a better show than many, but the sad fact remains for me: ""Alias"" is a has-been.  Maybe season five will be better.",1125014400,18,1076,4.482051282051282
2369830,5,B000A6T2BW,"Alias is an actionpacked drama with everything a person could want in a show.  For the new viewer the season starts with some generic episodes showing how things are done - Alias style.  Sydney (the main character) has had a lot to deal with over the past few years of her life.  But things are finally getting settled - that is, until she finds out a haunting secret about her father.  She finds documents at the end of the previous season that prove that her father, Jack, murdered her mother.  The mystery grows as Sydney uncovers why this happened.  In the beginning of the season Syd deals with her hatred for her father while trying to regrow the relationship.  Also, she quits her job for the CIA to go and work for a secret black-ops division.  She is shocked to discover that she will have to work for Arvin Sloane, a bad guy turned good who murdered her fiance and her best friend.  Syd and her old gang go through the season fighting the bad guys and saving the world.  Don't get me wrong, Alias isn't just some blowout show with costumes and explosions.  It also has relationships between characters that are not only understandable, but realistic.  The most prominent relationship Syd has this season is probably the relationship she is building with her new found sister Nadia. Another relationship is the relationship she is rebuilding with her partner Vaughn. They have always had strong feelings for each other but their relationship was strained over the past year. As the season progresses they gradually go back into the Alias flow and give us some serious stroy and drama.  Twists pop out when you least expect them.  Nothing is ever what it seems.  Alias is a perfect mix of lies, drama, action, romance, and relationship building.  Season Four is the perfect season to start with.  And the cliffhanger will blow your mind.  Go out and give this DVD a try because once you do, you'll be begging to see Season 5.",1124841600,3,1933,4.635294117647059
2369831,3,B000A6T2BW,"This season was a little dry and boring at times. I found the chemistry severely lacking between Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan. There were barely any scenes of real affection between them and when there were it was SO strained you just wanted it to end already.

Am I the only one that thinks that since they broke up in real life that their on-screen chemistry has been dry?

Two things that redeem this season to some degree are when Lena Olin came back (thank goodness!!) and the Season Finale where Vaughan admits that he's NOT REALLY VAUGHAN!!

That's going to be a great lead into the new season! I just hope that J.J. Abrams doesn't decide to axe Michael Vartan!

Another note for J.J.-stand alone episodes just don't cut it for most Alias fans if you read the ABC message boards. It may be great for bringing in new viewers. But a huge story arc is why most people got hooked on the series right from the beginning of Season 1!",1124409600,7,940,4.4476744186046515
2369832,5,B000A6T2BW,"Alias is one of the best shows that I have ever seen! There are so many things on this show that if other shows tried to create what Alias has, it wouldn't work. Alias is like the superman of all CIA/Spy type shows, it's the perfect combination of romantic drama, action drama, and human emotion drama. I especially LOVE all the plot twists, just when things look like they are getting settled down and back to some semblance of 'normal' then BOOM! the writers throw something completely unexpected at us (the viewers) and fill everyone's mind with questions like...

1. who is alive?

2. who is dead?

3. who only looks like they are dead, but in reality could come back to life in another stunning plot twist?

...and so on and so forth. All in all, Alias is an AWESOME show and anyone who doesn't think so should give it a chance. I'll admit, in 2001 when the show first premiered, and there were previews for it on ABC, it didn't interest me that much and I wasn't going to watch it. But then I kept seeing the commercials and, the more I saw of them, the more it made me want to watch the show. I finally decided to watch the Pilot and I was absolutely blown away by the storyline and everything that happened in the episode. It kept reeling me back in and making me want to watch more. Now, my friend K and I are two of the biggest Alias fans we know. WATCH ALIAS! :-)",1124323200,3,1374,4.252873563218391

Things that didn't add up for various reasons in Season 3, for the most part, are given proper and interested endings.  This is definitely worth purchasing.",1124323200,5,353,5.068965517241379
2369834,2,B000A6T2BW,"For most Alias fans, much more than their time is devoted to the show. And the show most certainly does not end when the hour ends on Wednesday night. Time is spent talking with other fans on the internet and discussing the show with friends. I am an Alias fan. I spend countless hours each week watching and discussing the show. This season, Alias fans everywhere were sorely disappointed.

In the past, Alias has been a strong show with interesting storylines, fabulous acting, and great art direction. This year, all three were below par. Jennifer Garner's performance (although the Emmy nominators may disagree) was not what it has been in the past. She lacked the passion that she had in the past that made even the most ridiculous storylines intriguing to watch. With a few exceptions (Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin), the rest of the cast had the same melancholy attitude as Ms. Garner.

The art direction in season four was dull and repeated. The set of choice this season was a nightclub; which can be interesting the first few times, but when it is exhausted it begins to drag the entire show down. Which it did. The only artistic aspect of the show that did not lose its life was the costumes that outfitted Ms. Garner. They were, as always, stunning and fabulous.

The part of the show that suffered the most was definitely the writing. I believe I can speak on behalf of many Alias fans when I say that it was absolutely abysmal this season. Many storylines seemed to be borrowed directly from the X-Files. Never before have the writers had to resort to exhausting paranormal storylines in order to get viewers. Also prevalent in the series this season were so many cheesy lines and bad dialogue. The best example of this comes in the season finale, ""Before The Flood"". It was embarrassingly bad. The exceptional talents of special guest star Lena Olin were wasted with a plethora of bad dialogue! Several examples of this come to mind: the whole speech about the white horse; and when Irina is reunited with her evil sister, Elena, she says ""Hi sis"". The writing of the finale pales in comparison to the actors.

The only advice I would give to Mr. Abrams and the good people at ABC for next season is to drastically improve the quality of the writing for next season. Also, I highly recommend bringing back the marvelous David Anders (Julian Sark) and Lena Olin (Irina Derevko) for next season. Both of these actors are beyond superb and improve upon the overall quality of the show dramatically.

As an Alias fan, I will be purchasing the fourth season; but it will be only for the reason that I purchased the third season: to complete my collection.",1123891200,19,2664,4.6716417910447765
2369855,2,B000A6T2BW,"Seasons 1-3 were simply fantastic.  Season 4 was pure rubbish.  Hardly one exciting event happened and looking back, even though i watched every episode every week, i cannot tell you 2 major events that happened.  Toxic water ballons, killer bees (what?!), a sacred plant (??)... this is what 4 seasons have lead up to?

Compared to past seasons, the ""bad guys"" are totally lame this time around.  The Sloane clone created tension for about 1 episode. Sark is completely wasted.  How many darn dance clubs can henchmen hang out in?

Other than that... Nadia is far too shallow, and her relationship with her father is pitiful.  Remember this is the man that injected you with vial after vial of toxins while strapping you to a chair.  (But he's my father! What?!).  Sark is wasted.  No major characters are introduced and the few that do matter are discussed off camera because they couldn't get them to come back for real.  Vaughn's search for his father was also sad as Nadia's.  Sorry but too many times this season i almost swore off the show - it reminded me too much of season 8-9 of X-files where people where just meant to be confused with a poor plot that went nowhere.

Alias fans are fooling themselves if they think this season was comparable to where the show first began.",1123804800,8,1285,4.628318584070796

The biggest draw of Alias in the prior seasons was that each episode solved some mystery and started another.  The big plots that continued from week to week always left you wanting more and desperate to see the next episode.  In season four, most of the episodes featured villians and story lines that ended with the show and I found myself not much caring about the next week.

J.J. has some big shoes to fill with Season five to get back to the star quality that Alias had in prior seasons - and trying to write Jennifer Garner's pregnancy into the show seems like a disaster waiting to happen to me...but I am hoping to be proved wrong!",1123459200,8,763,4.428571428571429

Abandoned most of what made it good, lost the arc and went for individual episodes. In the process it lost it's edge and is less fun. It didn't really get good until the last half of the season. Bringing back Mommy helped a lot.

With it up against Smallville, OC, Survivor and whatever NBC has to offer (Joey?) Season 5 is sure to be it's last.",1123027200,6,495,4.15625
2369859,4,B000A6T2BW,"An amazing thing happened in the last minutes of Season 4's penultimate episode ""Search and Rescue"": I had a feeling flood over me that I hadn't felt watching Alias since it was revealed Lauren was evil at the end of season 3's ""Full Disclosure"": I was hooked.  It had been so long since Alias was the vital, nail-biting show of high excitement and high melodrama that I almost didn't recognize it anymore.  Now, here was Lena Olin exibiting the full capacity of her greatness - equal parts loving mother and twisty snake, Jack was at the edge of his wits, Sydney was frantic and focused, and Nadia, thankfully, wasn't that important except to earn welcome gooeyness out of Olin.  How exactly did this happen?

Season 3 was widely viewed as a disappointment at the time, but at the beginning of season 4, it seems fans like me were nostalgic for its chaos and ambition.  To say the format for the season stretched the limits of credibility does a disservice to the limits of credibility.  A top secret CIA agency under the control of Arvin Sloane despite his so recently having been sentenced to death for treason?!  One with the lamest acronym in the history of acronyms (that being APO: Authorized Personnel Only)?  No amount of Rimbaldi-artifact-transferring makes that swallowable.  And the theoretical reconfiguation of the show, while noble, only made matters worse - a covert-op-of-the-week sameness took over in an ostensible attempt to make this look like season 1 again.  But as this opened the door for plotlines that ranged from ridiculous (a Russian Stepford Village of secret uber-spies) to embarrassing (umm, vampires?), any number of us long time fans were about to give up.  There was brief reprieve in ""Detente,"" a masterpiece exploiting Sydney's seething distrust of Sloane, climaxing in a cunning monologue about Sloane by an undercover Sydney to an insignficant baddy on a boat - it's one of the finest hours of Jennifer Garner's acting career.  Still, it seemed like an aberration - the plots never got past their high predictability.  And Nadia, as played by the gorgeous Mia Maestro, I'm afraid, is too much of a cold fish - her woe-is-me mommy issues are grating, and her unconvincing flirtation with Weiss - tv's most sexless and sparkless romance - seems there just to create a Weiss-Vaughn buddy repartee that's uninteresting to a fault.

Then came ""Tuesday"" - Sydney's buried a live, APO's locked down, and for some contrived reason Marshall's the only one who can save the day.  In the process, he resurrects the show.  From there, everything works - a cunning Derevko nemesis arrives and the world actually feels in danger again!  Joel Grey as a second Sloane!  Jack's near-fatal attempt to save Sydney!  Vaughn as a rogue agent (a far more convincing meltdown than his yeah-right freak out over Lauren in season 3)!  And no amount of words can convey the greatness of seeing Olin as Irina again.  Combine that with the show's cliffhanging car crash - a fall out of your seat moment to match Sydney's Hong Kong wakeup at the end of season 2 - and we find Alias in full addictive mode again, even accepting that it may never again reach to its unmissable stride of the second season.",1123027200,17,3213,4.826642335766423

I'm a guy who is not into the corny ""fan fiction"" and just watches for plain entertainment and good action. The show was good and smart for the first 3 seasons.

Season 4 had its moments, but it was disappointing. Only the last few episodes and the premiere episode was good, but there are quite a few terrible episodes this season.

I can only remember 2 episodes from season 1 that were as bad as the average season 4 episode.

Why were they bad? Alias is good because it keeps you interested from episode to episode, and this season, they completely got rid of that concept and went for self-contained episodes.

There were pretty much NO cliffhangers and there was a new bad guy each week, which was terrible and very uninteresting. This wasn't the case with the first 3 seasons.

2369863,3,B000A6T2BW,"Unlike a lot of reviewers here I really liked Alias 3rd season, it was exciting, different, unpredictable, with lots of cliffhangers and continued on with Rambaldi.  3rd season also contains a lot of Vaughn.  I am a huge Vaughn fan and therefore liked the season where he was showcased the most.  Even though he and Sydney were apart, you could tell they still loved each other and that angst kept you watching.  Now with season 4 I was hoping for a continuation of where Season 3 left off, with questions answered and more questions asked, with Sydney and Vaughn getting together.  Instead, for the 1st half of the season all you get are stand alone episodes of individual missions that have nothing to do with one another. There is no Rambaldi (which would be fine if there hadn't been so many questions left unanswered from season 3), all of our characters now work for the man they hate, Sloan, which makes no sense, and there is no excitement leading up to the next episode.  In previous years when you watched the show live or on DVD you were dying to see the next episode because they usually left you on some kind of a cliffhanger or with a question that just had to be answered ASAP.  For the first half of season 4 they didn't do that.  The executives at ABC wanted to try and revamp the show and get new fans and this was how they saw to do it, which is why it stunk.  The only exception is the episode ""Welcome to Liberty Village"" which is a great episode that puts Vaughn and Syd together at last, at least for a little while.  I was about to give up on the show when they finally started to bring back the Rambaldi stuff mid season.  The cliffhanging episodes still weren't there but at least our questions were finally being answered.  Then the last episode aired and they decided to bring on zombies ( which wasn't as bad as the vampires they had in an earlier episode but still - THAT IS NOT ALIAS!!!) but then the episode redeemed itself by a killer of a cliffhanger that I won't spoil here, but leads to what I hope will be a killer 5th season (as long as those ABC exes stay out of things).  So for true fans, you have to get this season for the last episodes and the bloopers (Alias bloopers ROCK!!!) just skip forward to the 3rd disc, but for new viewers, start with season 1, it is so much better.",1121731200,7,2320,4.330254041570439
