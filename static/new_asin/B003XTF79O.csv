8751900,2,B003XTF79O,"I bought this movie for my husband, a former Morris dancer from the UK. It took a while to get used to the spoof documentary style. Maybe if it had been half the length, or written in story style, it would have worked. For us, the movie dragged. The story was simplistic and the characters were not well developed. Some of the characters (the Orange County Morris men) were so stereotyped they were not funny after the first few minutes. We were both very disappointed in this movie. Would much rather see a real documentary with a lot more dancing included.",1294617600,3,558,4.534653465346534
8751901,5,B003XTF79O,"As a former US Morris Dancer, I REALLY want to see this movie, but over the pond here, we need the US/Canadian format. I suspect that there are a fair number of Morris and dance fans here.

The trailer looks great.",1286928000,11,214,4.219512195121951
