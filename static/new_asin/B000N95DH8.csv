8175701,5,B000N95DH8,"I own a few of the Homespun DVD's and they have been a great help in learning different styles of music. This DVD will get you started using Dropped D, Open G, and Open D tunings. Its very full sounding. From here you can play more blues, slack key, etc. Some basic finger picking gets you going. I plan on buying the next DVD after this one. If you are new to finger picking and open tunings this is the one to start on. Mary Flower is a great instructor and a very good guitar player.",1279756800,4,486,4.072916666666667
8175702,5,B000N95DH8,"As someone who is a Level 2, pushing into Level 3 player, I appreciate Mary Flower's Crash Course in Open tunings.  I have been diving into playing with a slide, something I decided to tackle after finishing up Happy Traum's 3 DVD set on fingerpicking guitar.  Open Tunings are simple to play in, and Mary covers them in a broad spectrum.  She is a gifted player and teacher.  With some chords only needing one finger, it becomes a lot of fun (with some memorization) to add in the glass slide (or metal, if you please) and this DVD is a good basic course to move onto other such DVDs as Artie Traum's DADGAD series, and into Bottleneck blues playing.  This is an essential DVD in building a strong foundation for Open tunings.

As I advance from here, my hope is to, when my foundation is strong, to move into Celtic fingerstyle.  Open tunings is essential for Irish guitar playing.  Mary's DVD is a solid part of my foundation.  many thanks to Homespun for another 5 star release.",1207267200,6,982,4.502824858757062
