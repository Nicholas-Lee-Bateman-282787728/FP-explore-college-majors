8226389,5,B000WZAE40,"This is a must have for people who love Michel Petrucciani. The way the piano is played...unbelievable! Anthony Jackson and Steve Gadd play like expected...very well together with Michel. With good equipment at home you enjoy this dvd time and time again. No DTS but the 5.1 is fine. The Steinwaytunes together with moments of silences will catch your attention and surprise you.
The added movie presents Michel in a way (i think) not many people will know/remember. Dreyfuss spent time and energy in this. Collectors item...so better order a.s.a.p.

8226391,5,B000WZAE40,"1.  I was expecting a decent music / concert DVD, which it is (good sound, good filming, a decent selection of songs etc...).

2.  But what actually blew me away was the documentary;  as advertised, this isn't some 5-10 min clip on Michel but it's a full blown interview of Michel and it's completely awesome.  To any fan of M Petrucciani's music, this DVD is a must have.",1265673600,,372,4.411764705882353

8226394,5,B000WZAE40,"I have been a fan of Michel Petrucciani for several years, but I only viewed this DVD recently.  The concert half of this DVD is simply some of the best piano trio jazz ever recorded in any format.  The sheer lyrical quality of Michel's playing can brings chill-bumps.  His version here of ""Brazil Like"" is truely beautiful, and the piece entitled Cantibel is so engaging you that will not be able to sit still.  I am also a huge fan of Keith Jarrett, but Petrucciani 's lyricism, timing, and feeling rival Jarrett's work, though the two are of course distinct in their styles.  The other part of the DVD allows many unguarded views of this unique man that are funny, sad, inspiring, uplifting, and entertaining.  You will feel you know Michel much better than you ever could from his music alone.  The final ""music video"" of his best known piece ""Looking Up"" is very well done and will make you feel good about the music and life in general.  I rented this DVD, but will almost certainly have to buy it eventually.  You will probably come to ponder what amazing music we missed due to Michel's early death at 36.  For me this is one of those clear indications that life is unfair.  Unfair of course to Michel, and unfair to the rest of us because we can't hear more of his unique and incredible talent.",1225843200,3,1303,4.478813559322034
8226395,5,B000WZAE40,"The previous reviewer pretty nicely summed up how magnificent this DVD truly is, no question. I would just like to add that this is essentially a concert version of Petrucciani's ""Trio Live In Tokyo"" CD, which is one of the best jazz recordings of all time. Drummers, buy this for no other reason than to learn how expressive you can truly be with brushes.

Petrucciani never fails to amaze me. The moment I think it's his lyrical expression, or empassioned phrasing that moves me, he lets loose with some fiery technical fusillade that blows me away. The documentary is wonderful , as it allows you to actually meet Michel in a setting that will endear him to you forever.

Anyone who loves jazz should have this, or beg to borrow a friend's copy.",1224892800,,748,4.616541353383458
8226396,5,B000WZAE40,"If you're a Jazz fan buy this DVD without delay. It features Michel Petrucianni in concert with Steve Gadd and Anthony Jackson in 1998.

The tunes they perform are:
Little Piece In C For You
Brazilian Like
Chloe Meets Gershwin
September Second
So What
Guadeloup
Take The 'A' Train
Cantabile

This concert is frequently shown on some of the arts channels (like Artsworld in the UK) and I've watched it a few times. However the DVD gives a better quality sound and picture, so its worth it for this concert alone.

However in many ways the documentary (travels with...) is actually the better half of the DVD. It still features some excellent music, but you get to meet the man as well. Although sometimes its subtitled, the main interview is done in English, so you really feel like you get to know this extraordinary man. Blessed with a wicked sense of humour as well as being a great jazz pianist you will see Michel Petruccinai with Stephane Grappelli (then aged 87), Roy Haynes, Charles Lloyd, as well as playing some wonderful solo Piano.

Having just watched the documentary in full, I will likely watch it again later today. My admiration for his playing and intelligence has gone up in leaps and bounds. He remains one of the finest European Jazz Pianists and this disc provides you with the opportunity to see and hear him in concert and in person. It doesn't get any better than that.",1216598400,7,1393,4.650406504065041
