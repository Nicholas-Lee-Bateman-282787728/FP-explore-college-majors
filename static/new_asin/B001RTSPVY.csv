3779229,5,B001RTSPVY,This is the best show to come to cable TV ever.  The characters are well played and the theme is edgy and relatable.  I hope they give Aaron Paul his due this year at the Emmys as he is soooooo good in this part.  Cheers to all involved in making such a compelling show!,1245024000,2,270,3.962962962962963
3779230,5,B001RTSPVY,"Now that everything was established in the short first season (writers strike) the second season gets things really going.

I will not spoil but I will say this show is now falling into history. It's one of the greatest shows of all time and will most likely only get better from here.",1244937600,58,285,4.480769230769231
3779231,5,B001RTSPVY,"Warning!  Many, many spoilers below!  Do NOT read this review of you do not want to be spoiled!  If all you want to know is whether this is a great show that is worth your time, yes, it most assuredly is.  Get it.  Watch it.  Look out for spoilers from here on out.

Season One of BREAKING BAD was interrupted unhappily by the writers' strike.  It was one of the very few shows that stopped production to come back strong afterwards (well, PUSHING DAISIES came back strong creatively, but its viewership dropped somewhat and ABC, panicking with the downturn in the economy, unwisely pulled the plug on its best series).  One of the reasons that BREAKING BAD was able to come back and even build a bit of buzz over Season One was the well-deserved Emmy that Bryan Cranston won as Best Actor in a Drama.  Anyone who had seen him in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE knew that he was an extremely gifted comic actor, but seeing him perform so magnificently in a drama was almost like watching Jerry Seinfeld morph into Laurence Olivier.  Even the few episodes of Season One were enough to prove to anyone that Cranston was not merely a great comic actor, but one of the best actors around, regardless of genre.

Season Two picked up where Season One left off and took Walter White and Jesse's story much further than had been possible in the debut season.  I am not quite certain where they had intended to end Season One.  I'm pretty certain that it would not have ended with Walter and Jesse making an arrangement with the gang lord Tuco to sell drugs to him.  No doubt they were forced to compact the story somewhat in Season Two to make up for the lost episodes.  The new season sees several general arcs develop.  Walter and Jesse's relationship to Tuco comes to an end and they are forced first to go into the business of selling themselves.  Later they make a new arrangement to sell their product to a major outside distributor.  Walter and Skyler's relationship comes under more and more strain as Walter strives to keep his life as a drug manufacturer hidden from her.  One of the most interesting parts of the show is the relationship between Walter and Jesse.  Although Walter despises and looks down upon Jesse, he also takes more and more the attitude of a parent towards an unruly child.  Even when he becomes a liability to Walter, he refuses to break his partnership with him.  But Walter becomes more and more hardened as the season goes along, becoming as ruthless as any of the drug lords he and Jesse encounter.

Some of his decisions are so extreme that by the end of the season Walter actually starts to become a less than sympathetic character.  In fact, as much as I love this show -- and it is definitely among my very favorites alongside such shows as DOLLHOUSE, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and MAD MEN -- I'm starting to wonder if Walter's growing hardening as a person will make him too unsympathetic a character for the show to stay as good as it has been.  Although other series like THE SHIELD have pushed the limits of how far one can go with the moral degradation of a lead character, there is a limit to just how far one can go.  By the end of Season Two one hardly empathizes with Walter as his life gradually begins to unravel.  And Jesse remains so pathetic that it is hard to care for him as much as we ought.  I'm far from the only person feeling this and hopefully in the off season the writers will listen to the fans and do something to make us care what happens to Walter, to make us want this to turn out OK for him.

As great as this series is, there was one other thing in Season Two, besides Walter's growing unlikeability, that was a cause of disappointment, and that was the season finale.  Beginning with the first one, several episodes began with confusing and disturbing images of some cataclysmic event.  The natural expectation was that this was all leading up to some huge event at the end of the season.  Only . . . it didn't.  There was an event, but it was completely unconnected to anything involving Walter or Jesse.  I was simply aghast when the finale ended with nothing like the kind of resolution that the entire season seemed to be leading up to.

There was a happy coincidence to end the season.  The finale was entitled ""ABQ.""  Initially I misread the title. I thought it was ""ABC.""  The reason this is interesting is that John de Lancie guest starred as the father of Jane, Jesse's girlfriend (played by the adorable Krysten Ritter -- when is she going to get a permanent gig on a series?  I've loved her on other shows like VERONICA MARS and THE GILMORE GIRLS and would love to see her in a major role on some series).  I have always loved John de Lancie and like Krysten Ritter, would like to see him far more often.  He is best known, of course, for his recurring role on the various STAR TREK spin offs, as the omnipotent, omniscient Q.  The happy coincidence is that many of his appearances on the STAR TREK episodes had titles that referred to his character, such as ""Q2"" or ""True Q"" or ""Qpid"" or ""The Q and the Grey.""  ""ABQ"" isn't too unlike one of those titles.  I don't think it was intended as homage to Q, but it was serendipitous.

All in all, despite the increasing unlikeability of Walter and the disappointing finale, this was a great season.  There were many great episodes and a host of unforgettable moments.  The shot of a decapitated head slowly moving across the desert atop the back of a turtle is shocking in its horror.  Equally marvelous is a near quadriplegic who can only communicate by ringing a tiny bell attached to his chair.  Or a car that is bucking and jumping in place without a driver.  Or a drug addled hag crushing her lover's skull by lowering an ATM machine on it.  And when you get in trouble, you know what you need to do:  You'd better get Saul!

I have a lot of faith in Vince Gilligan and his team of writers.  I think they will deal with the problem of Walter becoming too unlikeable.  And I think they will continue to come up with new and ever more fascinating story lines.  I'm excited about seeing what happens in Season Three.",1243900800,17,6124,4.437275985663082

Walt and jesse r offically meth cooks and tho its bringing in money they now have even bigger probs than walts cancer which is now in remission. And the two r having probs between them. The last episode here shows how walt is starting to lose his soul (as promised by the creater vince gilligan.) walt has starrted on a long road to hell and seems to b dragging poor jesse (who isn't quite looking like the worst guy in the show anymore) right along w him. By this season u should start to c why this is supposed to be the greatest show ever created. The writing is still good, the acting is amazing, its still funny and exciting and heartbreaking. And the characters r always evolving or devolving. At this point i was also begining to like the characters who id first found annoying. This show is wonderful and i highly recomend it. This season too.  Its great through out. The last episode esp, even tho its quite sad. U def c how walts already changing for the worst.",1509148800,,1022,4.378947368421053

But watching Breaking Bad is probably as addicting as the drugs Walter manufactured and sold.  IF you're gong to watch this series, be sure to watch Season 2 episode 6 ""Peekaboo"" where Walter teaches his science class about Carbon and the man who invented the first man-made diamond. That's my Father, H Tracy Hall, and my only claim to fame.  He probably rolled over in his grave when this series came out.  Google 'H. Tracy Hall'  to learn more about the real man and his diamonds. He was a good, quiet, patient, well mannered, faithful man with honor and integrity.  His most prize posession was his family and his faith, not wealth or fame.",1488240000,4,781,4.791044776119403

I only get a very minimal selection of channels and for me, the whole idea of a series where the main characters were into manufacturing meth just got on my nerves.  I finally broke down and watched this when I was in the process of recovering from surgery and had been spending a lot of time around the house resting.  I got into the story and really got into the characters who were for the most part well developed.  I have a connection to New Mexico, so that was cool as well.  I thought it was strange and a bit annoying that this series was censored!!! o.k the show is about meth guys, has loads of people saying ""bitc*"", strung out addicts, people having their brains blown to smithereens but, the ""f"" word and others were changed and frontal nudity was blurred out...There was not excessive nudity, it was not done in what would be considered obscene, it was just a scene of a body...this is not disney.  Why censor it?  I did not realize that I was paying for a censored version.  I also found out after the fact that some of the seasons are cut down by a few episodes.  What!!  Overall, a good series, but I did not appreciate the censoring or the reduced down seasons.  Just mentioning it so future buyers will be better informed consumers.",1480032000,,1351,4.403225806451613

The scenery is spectacular. The camera operators are the best ever. The music by Dave Porter is brilliant. My eyes are glued to the screen until the name Vince Gilligan appears at the end. What is most significant is the evolution of the main character, Walter White, into the villainous Heisenberg, an everyman haunted by the thought of his family trying to make their way in the world without him.

This season was beginning to strain credulity a bit.  Despite the many plausibles excuses the writers constructed for Walt to cover his activities, it was nevertheless difficult to see how he could spend so much time on his extracurricular activities while holding down his job without arousing Skylers suspicions even more than he did.  However, this was redeemed by the powerful final episode of the season.  Im late to the party on this show, so I know that it goes on for three more seasons.  However, it's hard to see how Walts house of cards is not about to come tumbling down.  Can't wait to start season three.",1452297600,,909,4.947368421052632

3779552,4,B001RTSPVY,"I watched more than two seasons before we had to cancel the cable due to the cost of it and all. Looking at the series years later it is pretty depressing what with the break up Walter White's marriage and all of the deaths that came from his meth production with the character Jessie Pinkman. I mean, I get the jist of it all, it's a story of a man and his pride. Walter White never had as much success in life until he cooked up some meth. Yes, he was a prodigy at Gray Matter, but then he got screwed out of the company or whatnot. I just purchased the entire series. I watched up until some time in series three. I'm into the third series. I like the series because it doesn't pull any punches about the ripples of the drug dealing. We see so many deaths due to the actions of Walter White and Jessie Pinkman.

3779607,5,B001RTSPVY,"I hate to say it, but Walmart has these DVDs in this series for the same price. So, when my son and I would get to the end of a season and I hadn't thought ahead to order the next one, he would run to the mart and get the next season. There was no financial gain in ordering from Amazon. If you get into this show, be sure to watch the Special Features part of the discs because that has great information regarding the producing of the show, interviews with Vince Gilligan and all the actors, etc. We enjoy that part of the discs as much as the actual episodes.",1443312000,,562,4.072072072072072

3779710,5,B001RTSPVY,"What can you one say about one of the greatest television shows ever that hasn't already been said? Season 2 of Breaking Bad picks up right where it left off with Walter and Jesse making big bucks from their blue meth. Walt is finding it increasingly more difficult to conceal is double life from Skylar, while Jesse loses becomes homeless in the process. Walt and Jesse have teamed up with Tuco, and it proves to be a tumultuous relationship. The season really comes to climax with the death of Jesse's girlfriend Jane. It goes without saying that Breaking Bad is like a good book: you just can't put it down (or stop watching in this case!). I would recommend BB for anyone looking for an invigorating and thrilling show that captivates its viewer and begs them to watch just one more. Before you know it, you'll have watched the entire season in one day.",1434240000,,857,4.571428571428571

3779785,5,B001RTSPVY,"Shocking, explosive, at times absurd, always compelling, the second season continues the momentum of the season one.  The plotlines escalate:  Walters spiral deeper into crime, the increasing difficulty of hiding the truth from his family, Skylers suspicions.  New developments concerning Walts cancer come into play as well.  We find out more about Walters background, but in a way that leaves us wondering which version of the past is true.  New characters are introduced, my favorite being the lawyer, Saul Goodman.  Hes the grown-up version of Eric Cartman.

Its not just the incredible storylines, but the humanity of the characters that makes this show so good.  Walt is not a bad man, but driven by an understandable and commendable need to provide for his family.  He agonizes over some of the choices he must make, but in the end, does what he needs to do to survive.  Walt remains likeable and relatable even if we disagree with his decisions.  Jesse also is not a bad person.  We see genuine warmth and concern in him, and hints that maybe hes starting to turn his life around, if only he can keep from backsliding.

I continue to loathe Walts wife, Skyler.  Her communication style consists of making demands and playing tit-for-tat to the point of maddening irritation.  I kept wanting her to stop the passive-aggressive act and TALK to Walt.  Anyone else in her position would have my sympathy. I would feel torn between supporting her wanting to know what was really going on and Walts need to keep his dealings secret. But with Skyler, I feel no compassion whatsoever.

Walts brother-in-law, Hank, continues to investigate the mysterious, blue meth and is in for some harrowing situations of his own.

I cant wait to see what happens in Season 3.",1423699200,2,1762,4.875420875420875

3779792,5,B001RTSPVY,"Breaking Bad Season Two is fantastic. There are so many memorable moments: the Tuco drama and the ranch house in the middle of the desert, Walt's ""fugue state"", naked in the supermarket, Hank action in New Mexico and in Mexico (ouch!!), the turtle, a short Danny Trujo scene, a girlfriend for Jesse and some amazing repercussions, four days in the desert in a ""bottle"" episode that explores Jesse's character a bit more, bad drug addiction and backsliding, the introduction of Gus the big league distributor, and the appearance of Saul! The ""Better Call Saul"" commercial is genius, as is the ""Ballad Of Heisenberg"" narcocorredos song that forms the beginning of one of the episodes. The ATM scene is crushing, as Jesse ""handles"" it. Then there's also the birth of Holly, the Walt donation site, the family on TV, Skyler and her new boss (the Marilyn Monroe ""Happy Birthday Mister President"" scene is particularly awkward!), a bad street execution of one of Jesse's dealers, and a lot of chaos and confusion. Walt and Jesse come so far in this episode - this becomes especially clear when listening to the commentary on the first and last episodes, when we see their priorities veer dramatically!!

The bonus features are pretty good - better than the first season DVD set, with twice as many commentaried episodes (four) and some fun stuff (like Dean Norris' Cop Talk), but there is also a lot of repetition between the generally useless ""Inside Breaking Bad"" and ""Behind The Scenes"" mini-episodes. There are also a few deleted scenes, but most of them are quite irrelevant. An exception is ""Walt's Demonstration"", which goes on for 2:11, and shows how he does a scientific demonstration in class, emulsifying oil and vinegar with an egg to create... mayonnaise! Cute. Another one, ""The Yearbook"" shows Saul doing a bit of research on Walt's (and Jesse's) school. ""Internal Thoughts"" is interesting as it shows Walt's oncologist reflected in mirrors pushing his guilt - bold and experimental, but not good enough to have put into the show. Then there's also ""Baby Proofing"", ""Welcome Holly"", ""Rushing Jesse"", ""Raincheck"", ""Waiting for results"", ""Walt's Return"" to school, ""Loading His Gun"", ""Reflections"", ""Blueberry Muffins"" and several other non-scenes that were clearly cut because they were too boring. Then there are 13 ""Inside Breaking Bad"" snippets of around 3:20, one for each episode, giving little intros and factoids. Not much to be gleaned here, but there are interesting insights from the actors and creators, such as commentary that in this season Walt becomes a father figure to Jesse, and that he does a full 180 through the season. Skyler finds her legs as an individual. ""Grilled"" was filmed in an abandoned ranch house that they had their way with. Squib wrangling: ""it's not a good day to come in hung over."" Aaron Paul comes up with his own Jesse-isms when he talks about ""chaotic-ness"". Aaron Paul IS Jesse Pinkman!! A real Dr Jeckyl and Mr Heisenberg story. ""Walt finally brings a bit of the evil Walt to his house."" Creepy Marilyn Monroe birthday song. ""The ultimate moment."" The ""Behind The Scenes"" extras are similar to ""Inside Breaking Bad"", but more thematic. ""The Cast of Season 2"", ""What's In A Name"", ""Making of Negra y Azul Video"", ""The Tortoise Scene"", ""The Special Effects"", ""The Props"", ""The Sets"", ""Locked In The Trunk"", ""Inside The RV With Aaron Paul"", ""The Crew"", and ""A Look Ahead"" (which doesn't look ahead to Season Three, but looks ""ahead"" to Season Two... which we've just watched...). The more interesting episode is ""What's In A Name"", where we learn that ""Bit By A Dead Dog"" is from a line in ""Treasure Of The Sierra Madre"", while ""Four Days Out"" is a conceptual homage to ""Flight Of The Phoenix"".  There's also the observation that the title of season opener ""Seven-Thirty-Seven"" is symbolic and ironic when coupled with the events of the last episode of the season. For the music video, we learn that there's a sub-genre of music in Mexico called ""narcocorredos"", which glamourises the adventures of drug dealers, and the band used in the show for ""The Ballad of Heisenberg"" is called Los Cuates De Sinaloa. From the propmaster, we learn that they actually used a rubber sledgehammer on the ATM, and that Danny Trejo's head had to be fully constructed with glass eyeballs and individual hairs. They kept it in a fridge. Rob Wilson King, set designer, talks for a bit. The RV was nicknamed the Methabago. ""Cop Talk With Dean Norris"" is a nice little, goofy, four-minute thingy where Dean hangs out with two cops (or actors?), two men and one woman, and they run through some amusing skits where Dean Norris proves that he IS Hank Schneider!! ""Who's your favourite TV cop?"" Usually Eric Estrada.

There's commentary for four episodes. On the commentary for season opener ""Seven-Thirty-Seven"" we learn that Skyler's pregnant belly in one scene is actually Betsy Brant's, as she was pregnant during most of Season Two (not Anna Gunn, who wore a belly prosthetic that ""smelled like bread""). Talking about the characters and their emotions and motivations. The Dog House is a real place in Albuquerque. The season's writers had to write into the plot the sale of Jesse's house because the real house that they were using was actually being sold by its owners! Giant rattlesnake on the set. Betsy wanted to run over the little boy, not just his radio-controlled car. Did it on the first take, so they didn't even need the eight spares that they had prepared. A couple called Fran and Lewis own the real White house. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul dressed up in each others' characters' clothes for a cast Hallowe'en party once, so Bryan went as Jesse Pinkman, and Aaron went as Walter White. On the first day of shooting, Bryan showed up dressed like Erich von Stroheim, with jodhpurs and a riding crop. Noted that each episode was shot in eight days, whereas a show like the X-Files was shot in 13-16 days, even with use of a dedicated second unit!! One of the actors was called ""Jesus Junior""! On the commentary for ""Better Call Saul"", we hear about how the opening scene was 4-5 pages long, but is all just one take. The long ""shadows"" of the morning were created by a huge bank of lights. Only 0:35 of the ""Better Call Saul"" commercial is seen, but the full commercial in the bonus features section is longer. While creating the commercial they had to remember how to do things unprofessionally so that it would look like crap. Jesse's tattoos are all fake. Krysten Ritter does Gap and Banana Republic ads, she's a comedienne; interestingly, many of the actors in the series work in comedy, such as Steven Michael Quezada (Gomez), Matt L Jones (Badger) and of course Bob Odenkirk (Saul). The Albuquerque baseball team The Isotopes took their name from The Simpsons, but also the history of nuclear research in New Mexico and Los Alomos. Production-wise, New Mexico gives the production a 25% rebate, which is not available in California. But the producers consider this a happy accident, as New Mexico has become a character in the series as well. In ""Four Days Out"" commentary we learn that the set was actually only 100 metres from the studio itself, but from the angles it would seem like it was in the middle of nowhere. They re-tell the story of the RV that they use, and how an elderly couple drove it for 20 years before retiring it and selling it to the Breaking Bad production crew. They had a pet tarantula crawling around the set, it crawled up Bryan's arm. The episode was 18 minutes too long... I wonder why they don't include any of those scenes in the ""Deleted Scenes"" section. In the commentary on ""ABQ"", there's discussion on Jonathan Banks as the PI that Saul uses. The floating bear from the pool is to be seen on Jane's mural. ""Pubes and pilates"". Script originally had Bryan puking on the TV interviewer's shoes. Very jokey commentary, not the best in the series. Explosion SFX team were the ones that did the Battlestar Galactica TV series.

The fourth disc probably has the best extras - it certainly has the most, as it goes onto two menus (look carefully, or you'll miss it... I nearly did). There are several original ""webisodes"", all of which are great. ""The Break-In"" (4:40) has Badger and Walt trying to break into an old lady's garage - seems that Skyler sold her an old family vacuum cleaner that he was hiding money inside of, and Walt needs Badger's ""lock-picking skills"", which he learned from his cellmate during his three weeks in jail. We get a sense of just how hilarious Badger really is, and more Star Wars dialogue. The best. ""Good Cop/Bad Cop"" has Marie getting frisky, role-playing some bondage stuff with Hank, which dissolves in argument. ""Nice Valentine's Day this turned out to be."" Hilarious. ""Wedding Day"" shows Hank with the jitters, decked out in a pure white cowboy hat, confessing a sexual indiscretion to Walt. Awesome. ""Twa&uuml;ghtHammr"" (4:00) is a goofy home video of Jesse with his band, hanging out with Badger, bickering. Then there's the music video of ""'Fallacies' by Twa&uuml;ghtHammr"" (4:00)... with a cameo by the pool bear... the song's even pretty good!! ""Marie's Confession"" is just that - a talky video that she does on her therapist's advice that runs the gamut of emotions, thoughts, questions, and mediations on Madonna. ""It's embarrassing to America!"" Seems that Marie bought a cone bra like the one that Madonna wore, and it was more comfortable than she thought it would be. ""It made me feel powerful!"" Then there's a short documentary on the making of ""Walt's Warning"" (2:40). ""Oh... And stay out of the desert!"" Wacky Bryan and the fire extinguisher. Looks directly into the camera... more intense that way. ""Gag reel"" (3:50) has plenty of cracking up, and pictures from the Hallowe'en party when Bryan went dressed as Jesse, and Aaron wore a bald cap and fake moustache and went dressed as Walt. There are also 37 great pictures by Vince Gilligan, including one of ""the two Tucos"" (Raymond Cruz and his stunt double) and one of two Hanks (Dean Norris and HIS stunt double), but otherwise nothing too interesting. One scene from Season 3 (Hank and Walt and the bag with half-a-milion-dollars) as a ""sneak peek"".",1422748800,,10233,4.839041095890411

3779823,4,B001RTSPVY,"Walter White and Jesse Pinkman have made a deal with a local crimelord to distribute their distinctive blue-tinged crystal meth, but their associate turns out to be highly unstable and dangerously unpredictable. As they try to extricate themselves from their situation, Walter's medical treatment continues and his secret comes dangerously close to being exposed.

The second season of Breaking Bad picks up immediately where the prematurely-ended (due to the 2008-09 Writer's Strike) first season ended and continues the themes established there. Walter White is having the worst mid-life crisis ever, the bitterness and resentment built up by a lifetime spent achieving only mediocrity finally boiling over, catalysed by his cancer diagnosis, and fuelling his evolution into a surprisingly competent criminal. The show isn't interested in standing still and pushes White's development episode-by-episode whilst contrasting that with Jesse's descent back into drug addiction hell and showing the impact of these events on White's family and Jesse's strained relationship with his parents.

As before the show is darkly humourous and relentless in how it shows White trying to justify everything logically (if only to himself) and becoming at times speechless in disbelief when other people don't buy his selfish reasoning. The core of the show remains Bryan Cranston's committed performance and that's even stronger this season than before. Aaron Paul also deserves superlatives for the tricky balancing act of continuing to make Jesse sympathetic even when he is self-destructing so wastefully.

The greater episode count this time around allows for the deepening of the secondary cast. In particular, Dean Norris gets more to do as Walter's DEA agent brother-in-law, who moves from simplistic jock meathead to a more layered character suffering panic attacks after witnessing the real horrors of the drug war along the border. New and highly memorable characters also show up, such as Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), a brilliantly slimy lawyer who becomes Walter's confidante by dint of no-one else being available. Krysten Ritter puts in a terrific performance as Jesse's arty new girlfriend Jane, with the excellent John de Lancie playing her father. There's also some fertile ground-laying for future seasons, with both Mike (Jonathan Banks) and Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) appearing in the last few episodes as Walter and Jesse's new - and hopefully more reliable - business associates.

Negatives are hard to find. There's an underlying air of implausibility about the show, such as Jesse's drug dealing associates doing their business in broad daylights on street corners with bling prominently on the display, and the final episode strains credulity with unlikely coincidence building on unlikely coincidence before the final moments of the season which feel very random. But the subsequent season does a good job of selling these moments to make them work better in retrospect.

The second season of Breaking Bad (*****) is, by a nose, better than the first, written and acted with growing confidence and a more accomplished juggling of the different characters and storylines.",1419552000,,3182,5.485714285714286

3779843,5,B001RTSPVY,"What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very few series that competes with the best films in history for achievement in cinematic storytelling. Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing.

A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles,
this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and more disturbing each year.

In a way, thematically it recalls ""The Godfather I and II"" in how that epic charts Michael's journey from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the endless drive for money and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an
end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a game we can never win.

The second season made clear the promise of the first would be lived up to. The show would go to the edge, even if it meant risking alienating the audience. This is powerful, important and yet utterly enthralling stuff.",1418256000,,1307,4.8

3779974,5,B001RTSPVY,"I just finished watching the entire Breaking Bad series. Took me four days but it was worth it. A very dark subject with so many normal human elements to it. I don't know who true to life all these situations are regarding this particular drug but can imagine it, especially in a World where money rules everyone. Walter White is a very passive unambitious genius who finally finds his Europa within making this drug. He has been left out of everything in his life previous and now a cancer diagnosis brings him to a decision to provide for his family ""after he is gone"". His decision brings out some of his worst demons until he cannot control them. This is a great drama series which I at first didn't want to watch because of the drug content. But I am glad I did. Maybe some people will get the subtle message from watching this. Drugs will kill you in the end.

PS - It's best to watch an entire Season at one sitting as it has more impact",1409356800,,944,4.303370786516854

3779979,3,B001RTSPVY,"Walter White has tried making meth with his former high-school pupil in an effort to cover medical bills for his cancer treatment and leave money for his family. Unfortunately, those involved in the meth trade are far from trustworthy, non-violent citizens that most of us our used to. White realizes he needs to move from small-time dealing to much higher volumes, and this leads to meeting a vicious Mexican drug dealer. Escaping their attempt at robbery results in White becoming first an accidental killer, and then a deliberate one. Walter has transformed from a sympathetic character into a reprehensible one. Meanwhile, his constant absences leads his wife to suspect the truth.

Walt and Jesse are hardcore embedded in the drug trafficking business, and it becomes increasingly more difficult for Walt to keep all of his secrets straight.  Meanwhile, Jesse finds love with his neighbor/landlady, but Jane leads him down an increasingly dangerous path. The season finale is an incredible episode: I liken the final Walt/Skyler scene to be on par with some of Tony and Carmela Soprano's greatest moments.

3780115,5,B001RTSPVY,"season two , was as powerful as the first. And we see the lead character become even more corrupted. OF course drug dealing is evil and that's why they call this series , 'breaking bad'.  There a several dark humor episodes as our dealers do stupid things. But this remains a dark drama. And everyone I know that was involved with drug dealing went very bad indeed.  WIth most of them , ready to kill even friends if they had to, so the show remains true on that level.  This looks best in hd of course, but if you must watch it on dvd , then it's better than nothing.  The acting is of course  top notch and the show hit it's stride with this season and it introduced new characters as well.  This season wasn't breaking wind , it was breaking bad and you will find a guilty pleasure in watching the moral fall of walt and his crew.",1403568000,,833,4.175

3780233,5,B001RTSPVY,"If you are reading this review chances are you have already watched season 1.  Breaking Bad is one of the greatest shows in TV history.  While everyone in the cast is terrific, Bryan Cranston seems like he was born to play Walter White...he just nails every scene.  The plot and dialogue are well written, with plenty of twists and turns.  Even the ancillary characters are interesting.  Season two follows along where season one left off and without spoiling anything, in this season you really begin to see the evolution/devolution of the characters.  One of my favorite things on the show, and something that reinforces just how well crafted the show is, is that the car model each character drives really fits their personality; it sounds weird but try to notice it.  As a car nerd, this was very appreciated and kudos goes to whomever chose the character's cars because it speaks a lot to the character's personality traits; i.e. Walt's Aztec.  This is great TV and I highly recommend it.",1394841600,,993,4.8

Not for everyone for sure, but if you can handle it, amazing. I suppose a good parent would want their teenagers to watch the show along with them. The dark world Walter lives in is not a pretty place. Maybe the dismissive young people could learn a thing or two before finding out the hard way. It is anything but a commercial for being a bad guy. Somewhat unlike the Sopranos in that regard.

Many surprises. Strange twists. Seemingly authentic in street Spanish and life on the other side.",1393372800,,523,4.623655913978495

Otherwise, this is one of my FAVORITE shows of all time.  Great writing, fantastic characters, interesting pace and entertaining dark comedy mixed in with the serious 'evil' of drug lords.  I would recommend to adults; not for young viewers (but I'm old fashioned that way) and if you ever make it past the first episode you'll be hooked forever.",1393372800,,858,4.4113924050632916

From the jaw dropping opening Pilot (""I only had you in my heart."") to the heartbreaking Felina, the quality of the five seasons never once dropped from Perfect.

I could go on. I could talk about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bryan-Cranston/dp/B006W0QOF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bryan Cranston</a>'s legendary, immortal performance as high school-teacher-turned-meth-chef Walter White. I could talk at length about the jaw-dropping work from Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, and Bob Odenkirk in their moving, finely crafted roles. I could talk about the perfect use of music and lighting, the camera work and stunning cinematography. I could talk about the writing, sharp and realistic and beautiful. All these and more are the elements (this IS a show about chemistry...) that took Breaking Bad from what it could have been: an entertaining black comedy/drama, into what it is: ""a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell"" of Shakespearean proportions (words of superfan Anthony Hopkins).

But I won't talk about that. I'll just say one thing: watch Breaking Bad. Watch all 57 perfect episodes of it, and when you're done, come back here and drop a comment telling me what you thought. And if I was right...vote Yes. BReaking BAd gets five stars from me.

3780311,3,B001RTSPVY,"It's always a chore to follow up a killer initial season, and, I'll be frank, Season Two did nothing for me until about Episode 10. I think the major problem was I just am not interested at all in any relationship on the show bar the one between Walter and Jesse. When they're on screen together or over the phone, I'm invested. Otherwise I just find my mind drifting off.

The new lawyer Saul character I just find plain annoying. I get that they wanted to introduce new characters but even the DEA agents in El Paso get short shrift after that one scene that I won't spoil for anyone. Hank returns to Albuquerque, and the whole thing seems way too brushed over. Just odd dramatic choices in the story and script.

I know this series has been compared to ""The Wire,"" and in this way it's exactly like that series where Season Two I found the whole thing sort of losing its way a little.

Obviously, I'm hoping Season 3 onwards kicks it up a few notches and judging from Episodes 10-13 of this season, it will. Actually, that may have been the problem as Season Two was 13 episodes whereas Season One was a lot tighter having just seven episodes.",1391472000,,1146,4.39622641509434

3780551,5,B001RTSPVY,"Season 2 of Breaking Bad continues the incredible premise set up by the 7-episode first season.  The dark humor is intact, as well as the intense action and drama that made Season 1 so groundbreaking.  The storyline is intriguing, but Bryan Cranston's acting makes this one of TV's best shows.  The man is captivating no matter what kind of scene he's doing.  We all know how well he can pull off humor from his work on Seinfeld and Malcolm in the Middle, but he can do anything and everything else required of Walter White's character.  Any emotion you can think of, he can find the perfect facial expression and voice to make the viewer feel exactly what his character is experiencing.  When you have an actor who can carry a show like Cranston does, you don't need to have one of the most compelling plots ever thought up for a series...but Breaking Bad has that, too!  The ripple-effect of consequences stemming from Walt's self-destructive decisions continues to spread wider in this 13-episode season, and Walt seeks deeper into the underworld of the drug game.  The show resonates because we all say we'd do whatever it would take to protect and provide for our family, but how far would we really go?  How many of us would stoop to crime if we thought it would leave our families financially secure for their entire lives?  Desperation can be a powerful motivator, and this show clearly makes that point.  With an incredibly strong supporting cast that's just barely a notch below Cranston himself, Breaking Bad has more to offer than just about anything on TV.",1384041600,,1569,4.731617647058823
3780552,5,B001RTSPVY,"Gotta love it, if you are a fan. This just takes off where the first season left off. All, just leading to that inevitable end for Walt.

3780556,3,B001RTSPVY,"The news gets worse--Walt's dying, his wife and son are so clueless that they don't even know he's trying but dying; his idiot brother in law is still making obnoxious jokes and doesn't have a clue about other people's lives; his wife (the sister)  drifts downward into a pathetic space that makes even the sight of her painful.

But then there's the virtue of her shoplifting...Go girl.  There must be a talent / runway/ ""stealing with the stars"" show in the wings.

Breaking Bad is great. It's the end of society. Finally, an end to the Sacred-Profane/ High Culture-low Culture  continuum. Yeah, so what? I'll still get mine before you die, bro. What's the Big Deal. Too munching thinking for now. Gotta check my Twitter stock.

Back to Breaking Bad: The kid/partner/Yo! is so without moral, emotional, social, career, or life insight that he's a drift like the smoke from his bong. It's the death of introspection & the pretext of a social contract. Hey, whatever... no judgements, no fiber, no nothin' expect going with ""some flow,"" man. Btw: got a Special Sale Promo eMail on a combo --pair of True  Religion hand washed jeans (black) and a V-neck Psycho-Bunny shirt (red). So must speed this up. If you're slow, you lose dough, ya know!

 Sorry if this show gives your life meaning, but maybe you should sponsor a child or read a good book. But, hey, whatever man, no hassels, no strings. If you can get over your G-friend choking on here vomit and feeling sorry for yourself for a (short) while, then this is a Great sho! Just watch the Swiss cheese-meth holes in your head before driving--I mean, like, I'm on the road, too.

Overall, a truly new An American Classic. Death of a Salesman, who's Afraid of VW, Kill a Mockingbird--like so old and so dead. Forgetabboutit!  Like,this is very REAL. Dead on (no pun). Complete. Makes my day. Whatever...Just don't remind me that I went to college! I  can still  attend ""Mindfulness Seminars"" to improve my concentration and competitiveness around Seattle or when they catch on in Manhattan's Upper West Side as long as my media streams, everything is Cool. Like Miley (love her, too!).

In the meantime, a real dilemma. Forget all ""sick and suffering"" I've got to put up  a family foundation to harness my energy. That and watching all the episodes of BB will improve my karma, get me more hits on Social Media and make me a more evolved, planetary person.

No Judgements, Except going to the gym is like very, very important. PS: a real bargain is taking the Mindfulness Seminars & signing up for the newsletter at 18k for 6 months with suggestions about how to Think like a clearer person --I swear it helps! My G-d, this is changing my life--like forever. Go Walt, Go cook! You're an entrepeneur and I love you!",1383609600,,2767,4.674226804123712

The only hope I have is that Breaking Bad just may be able to educate the rest of the eastern and southern United States to the fact that New Mexico is a STATE in the United States.

DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED BREAKING BAD Season 2.

Amid all the darkness of BREAKING BAD's second season there is light, and generous pockets of laugh-out-loud comedy.  The funniest dialogue spills from the mouths of characters not around in the first season.  Skinny Pete's nonchalant delivery of ""Feng Shui, yo!"" comes to mind.  A man of Skinny's limited intelligence would not even know how to spell Feng Shui, let alone pronounce it.  Yet the expression rolls off his tongue as if he were intimately versed in the Chinese concept.  And that's one of the throwaway lines.  The best ones come from Saul Goodman, a one-of-a-kind criminal who happens to be a practicing member of the Bar.  The first time I saw 'Better Call Saul' I thought the suits should give good ol' Saul a show of his own.  And they did!  One can't help but accept Saul's deliberate smarmy approach, his license plate is LWYRUP, typical of his sense of humor.  His multitude of underworld connections yields a number of interesting personalities who aren't funny at all; suffice to say they're scary and realistic people.  Chief among them are Gus, slight in stature, mild-mannered and walks without moving his arms but seethes menace; and the damage control expert to whom Saul conveys complex instructions in cryptic Saul-speak: ""I think we got a wife problem.""

Danger keeps looming up more and more around Walter and those he loves.  Jesse has an intense side-story (without Walter but with consequences) that concludes with him holed up in what looks like a native American Indian sweat lodge.  Walt Jr. AKA Flynn becomes quite a forceful personality taking turns hating both his mother and his father.  Flawlessly portrayed but totally unlikable Hank Schrader becomes slightly less overbearing, i.e. a bit more likable.  Not a lot but a bit because some chinks in his armor are divulged.

BREAKING BAD Season 2 has a lot going for it, wonderful writing, acting and photography, the outdoor scenes make me want to move to New Mexico.  If one looks closely enough a lot of the pre-credit openers are out-and-out tributes to Sergio Leone.  Clever, subtle, nice.  Why four stars instead of five?  There's only one bad show out of all 13, 'Four Days Out,' with Walter and Jesse stranded in the desert without water for a boring amount of time.  This dispensable episode drags unbearably and, although not laborious to watch, is curiously slow compared to the show's regular frenetic pace and seamless weave of multiple interconnected storylines.  That alone doesn't merit a four-star rating.

I felt cheated by the plane crash finale though horrified just the same.  Cheated because the whole second season previewed images of Walter's shattered windshield and body bags in his driveway begging to mislead the viewer into thinking two of the White family die by violence.  The last show of the second season opens by panning back from the driveway to a panoramic wide angle shot that includes the smoke of two separate fires burning behind his house.  I wondered what that meant until Jane's father was revealed as an air traffic controller then immediately knew he would cause a crash.  BREAKING BAD is not a mystery story, per se, it doesn't need such unnecessary misdirection, sufficient tension existed without it.  Those flash forward images DO ratchet up viewer suspense.  Except in the end the payoff is undercut bigtime, yo!",1380412800,,3471,4.993031358885017

3780643,5,B001RTSPVY,"The acting, the scenery and the plot are all amazing!! I found the first episode a little difficult to get through, only because alot happens that the watcher doesn't understand. I.e. opening scene of racing through a desert in an RV, with the driver in his underwear, passenger fully clothed with a gas mask on and two dead bodies in the back, seemed to me to be a plot similar to one of my 12 yr olds ""random"" cartoons from cartoon network.

Once you get through the first episode, and the loose ends are pulled together, the series is awesome... Don't start watching if you don't have ALOT of free time....",1380412800,,609,4.486486486486487
3780644,5,B001RTSPVY,"I hate to be jumping on the bandwagon that is this show, but it really is perhaps the best show that has ever been made.  There have been so many shows that have had lulls in the middle, or have created muddled story threads, and with the exception of one plot point in between Seasons three and four, this show has been the most consistent and engaging that I have ever seen.  As much as I liked the first season, this was really the one that brought me into the show.  The relationship between Jesse and Walt during this season is completely amazing, I have to say that Tuco is probably not the best foil in the world, but he still provides plenty of great moments for the show, culminating in the great hostage scene with the man with the bell.  This show really gets all the details right with a great mixture of tense suspense, and satirical humor.  The best part of this show is Jesse's new girlfriend who almost tears him away from Walt, despite the two really needing one another to get out of the mess they get themselves into.  A very tight season with very little fluff.",1380153600,,1081,4.353233830845771
3780645,5,B001RTSPVY,"Repetitious...not the show...anything that I could say. I watch hardly any ""fiction"" TV and don't pay attention to reviews or hype so I completely missed this series until only a couple of months before the final episode. Even the less-than-outstanding episodes in Seasons 1 & 2 have left me scratching my head about how anyone could write and produce something so well. In any event, congrats to the cast, director, writers, crew, etc. for a well-earned ""Best"" in many Emmy categories. Oh...this is the first and only video I have watched on my nearly-obsolete Kindle Fire -- and it's been ideal for me. I particularly like the ability to easily stop, rewind, pause, re-watch -- whatever -- without having to mess with a remote. 'nuf said.",1380067200,,740,4.880952380952381
3780646,5,B001RTSPVY,"Some months ago I watched and reviewed season 1 of this amazing show. Took a while to get to season 2 as I've been paying loads of games lately, but now that I've completed season 2 I gotta say it's every bit as good as season 1, if not a bit moreso. Someone else in one of these reviews mentioned character development. That among many other things is a real strong point for season 2, I agree. Even the bad guys got great character development. Tuco is particular resonates as one of the greater psycho characters I've seen in a television show.

[SPOILER ALERT for Breaking Bad and for the video game Rage!!!!] Speaking of Tuco, I played Rage a year or so ago and was delighted to stumble across Tucos grill sitting on a shelf in the Sherrif's office! Twas funny as all get-out.[SPOILER OVER]

Anyway, many people have said many things on this title already so I will wrap this up by saying if you loved season 1 season 2 is an easy win for you. Enjoy it!",1379980800,,958,4.316666666666666

This season starts off with high energy and a bit of action, then it slows down 2 mid tempo and towards the end things really pick up again with a really insane, dark, dismal, and bizarre cliff hanger. Can't spoil much in this review, lets just say in this season Walt really finds out how deep ""this business"" he is in really is, and what it might take 2 make it big in it ;)",1379894400,2,755,4.323943661971831

3780650,5,B001RTSPVY,"Breaking Bad is very interesting.

The acting is superb.
Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:

l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, ""Sure, Mom!"" like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and more. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.

2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believeable.

3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house--case over.

4. At Tio's when Tuko throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over.

5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.

6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers.

7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.

8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.

9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believeable.

10. When Hank was driving by the laundry, he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night.

11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.

12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.

13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.

14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.

15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.

16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant.

17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. The magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.

18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.

19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed.

20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.

21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.

22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.

23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.

24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.

25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.

26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.

27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.

28. Once Skylar found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.

29. They can pay $800,000 for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????

30. Walt would have been traveling to the Caymen islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.

31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.

32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.

33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.

34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skylar. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, ""Diamonds, that will shut her up.""

35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat? In New Mexicto with heat in the 100's to 110's?

36. Skylar would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.

37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.

38. The police are portrayed as bunbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believeable that no police officer can put two and two together.

39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Jr. Noone gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. cash closed

40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have just to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.

41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.

42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.

43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.

44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle and he does not smell. Not believeable.

45. Hospitals film all visitors. Hank would have reviewed the tapes to see who was visiting Jesse. case closed

46. All in all, too many things just are not believeable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.",1379548800,,7969,4.282

The writers bring us into a family of very real people from the very beginning.  Fully fleshed out characters as though they were each the star of the show and there were no supporting roles.

The writers and actors bring us into the real world of the problems.  Meaning when someone is homeless for example, it's not some sort of 'oh Jesse is on the streets with no where to go' and fade out to new scene.  No, the viewer is brought into the moment fully.  Without ever becoming boring, the viewer stands with Jesse through almost every desperate phone call he makes, being thrown out my his buddy's wife, and more (I don't want to spoil that episode for anyone).

3780698,4,B001RTSPVY,"I fell in love with this series in Season One.  The first few episodes particularly were very smart and quite hilarious.  I totally bought the outrageous premise that a mild-mannered Walter Mitty type would morph into an aggressive drug dealer.  The actors were all good and I enjoyed the different personalities.  As far-out as the idea was, the script was so well written and acted that it seemed actually plausible as well as being highly entertaining.

In Season Two, Walt had already grown into his new greedy self and there's not as much fun in watching it. I missed the humor and wit.  But it's interesting, from a psychological perspective to watch Walt coming into his power.  Apparently this is a man with some kind of Bad Mom who has married a woman who perpetuates the problem. Early on in the first season we see Skyler feeding Walt some sort of limp strips of vegetarian bacon. Ha. He eats it, uncomplainingly of course, just as he eats her repeated disrespect and that of his teen aged son who looks to the hyper-macho uncle as a role model.  Jesse got Skyler's number the first time he met her when he later referred to her as a ""nutcracker.""  Poor Walt doesn't quite get that yet and he caves in to her time and time again.  The episode with the ""talking pillow"" was amazing!

By Season Two, Walt has descended into the underworld to reclaim some of his lost power. (Shades of Dante and Carl Jung!)  But he's still a little wobbly in his use of power.  He still caves into his wife but explodes sometimes abusively, at Jesse.  It isn't a lot of fun to watch but it is psychologically credible.  The relationship with Jesse is the best part of the show in my opinion.  I love seeing them progress from incessant bickering to something much, much better.

Jesse's romance with Jane, the Girl-Next-Door was a welcome change from the darkness of the drug dealers and the inanity of Skyler.  The Sklyer character is interesting in that she is so bloody annoying yet she is presented as Mrs. Perfect Wife.  No wonder the man got cancer!  He should have consulted a psychiatrist as well as an oncologist but that wouldn't have made such a good story.  This is no fault of the actress; she plays it perfectly and she looks just right.  I live near Albuquerque and I could see Skyler in any of the local malls. She just made me want to scream, that's all.

So was a relief, even visually to see  Jesse fall in love with Jane, the Girl-Next-Door, 21st Century, Albuquerque version. This Jane wears all black, talks tough and works in a tatoo shop in Nob Hill. (You can see Janes all over Nob Hill, in black boots, smoking cigarettes and, for some reason I've never understood they favor wearing straight black bangs.)  I liked the whole sequence with Jane and her Dad, the air traffic controller.  It brought back the elements of love and tenderness that the show needed to balance the violence. There's a great scene in a bar where the two dads who've met by chance talk about their daughters.  It's beautifully written and it ties in wonderfully with the following sequences where we see, literally, the ""fall-out"" of the incident with Jane.

I fell in love with Jesse Pinkman, early on in Season One and he continued to hold my heart through Season Two.  Not to push the symbolism too far, but I  see him, the pink-man, as representing a true tender heart while Walter White is all bound up in being Mr. White. The poor guy gets beat up over and over but he manages to keep his heart open.  He took the rap for the joint, saving his younger brother, and he went out of his way to help the poor red-headed child of the wasted druggies.  Over and over he takes the heat from Walt, who is still caught in rigid Mr. White self-righteousness.  Until finally even Walt's heart melts at Jesse's problems and instead of yelling at him, he helps him.

Actually the more I've ruminated about Season Two the more I've decided that it contains some great moments and Ive revised my intial three star score to four. It isn't as much fun as Season One and there are a lot of tedious scenes, mostly involving the doctors and Skyler and I saw more close ups of Walt's very tense face than I cared to see.  But it's still intelligent TV and worth seeing.",1376265600,,4247,4.5

3780722,5,B001RTSPVY,"Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.

Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S***it truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.

At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the ""righteous"" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.

Molecular visuals of METH.
Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.

After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, ""the blue stuff"", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.

For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.

At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.

Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.

DISCUSSION:

I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:

Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug ""meth"" by amateurs in their own ""RV super lab""? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?",1373846400,,5267,4.794928335170893

3780733,2,B001RTSPVY,"The vendor refunded my money on this item because even though the package says there is closed captioning, there is not. I give this vendor a huge thumbs up for her more than fair treatment.  I believe this is a manufacturing defect.  I've written to Sony to David Bishop, President, Worldwide SonyPictures Home Entertainment, and though he forwarded my request to his consumer affairs department, they have just given me the runaround and there has been no action.  This was a gift for my father who is hard of hearing and needs the closed captioning to be able to follow the story. I said to Mr. Bishop:  I purchased all four seasons of  the AMC series ""Breaking Bad"" on DVD for my father who is elderly and hard of hearing.  I chose these DVDs because they included the ""CC"" code on the package which convinced me they had closed captioning encoding on the disk.  This is important to me for my father, but you probably know that 48M people in the US (up to 15% of your customers) are deaf or have some degree of hearing loss. Providing accessibility extends your audience reach in the deaf community, as well as helps you meet legal requirements.  As the population ages, the number of people relying on closed captioning will surely rise.

Closed captioning has been provided on a voluntary basis by many movie producers, studios, and distributors for movie videos and DVDs produced for sale or rent.  Though it is voluntary, having the symbol of ""CC"" on the packaging would seem to me to be a promise that the disks were, indeed, encoded with closed captioning.  Sadly, I tried to display this on several devices and on my PC using Windows Media Player as well as HP's TouchSmart DVD player.  It does not display on any of our three DVD players.  I do not believe the closed captioning tracks exist.

There are subtitles, but only in French and Spanish .  English subtitles could have helped my Father since he is not totally deaf, but you do not have English subtitles on any of them.

I paid more than $60 for all four seasons.  Ive disappointed my father who was looking forward to them.  So, I am appealing to you to explain why you have not included the Closed Captioning on these DVDs.  Your company is a leader in the industry and even though you're not required to encode the Closed Captioning, putting it on the package is a promise that was not fulfilled.  Had I known, I would not have purchased them for him.

I learned that you distinguished yourself for leading the industry in the initial launch of DVDs while at MGM and with you at the helm, MGM received numerous prestigious customer service awards.  I am only one customer, but I do feel I am speaking not only for myself, but for 48 million customers who also need your leadership.  I look forward to understanding this situation more and I hope for a solution from your customer service team right away.  (Dad isn't getting any younger)

The first season was absolutely great, despite it's short episode number (as a result of the Writer's Strike that year), but season 2 doesn't let up and shows the lives of the main characters get as complicated and crazy as ever.

3780759,5,B001RTSPVY,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-first-season-of-Breaking-Bad/dp/B001DJLCRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The first season of Breaking Bad</a>&nbsp;saw Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high-school chemistry teacher, and his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) join forces to produce and distribute methamphetamine in Albuquerque after Walt is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  Season Two was originally broadcast on AMC in the spring of 2009, and this DVD set contains all of that season's 13 episodes as well as special features that discuss the filming and plot.

Walt decided to become a drug dealer to ensure financial security for his family after his impending death, but he and Jesse quickly ran into much more trouble than they anticipated--when this season started, they were already responsible for a death and found themselves as a business partner with someone insane (and that's putting it mildly), and their troubles only multiply in Season Two.

The blue-colored meth that Walt produces with his vast knowledge of chemistry begins to sell quickly on the streets of the Duke City, and both Walt and Jesse rapidly progress in street smarts, but the unintended consequences of their life of crime escalate throughout this season.  The two live a life of constant danger, do things that they likely thought they would never have to do such as launder money, must associate with many unsavory characters, and have to evade the police, including Walt's brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris).

The series portrays the tremendous psychological tension Walt suffers in attempting to live a double life and to keep his dealings secret from his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn).  The entire season, but the final episode in particular, shows the extent to which the crimes of Walt and Jesse affect not just them, but Walt's marriage, their families, Walt's old friendships, and total strangers as well.

A recurring theme that really arrests the viewer is the sheer number of lies that Walt tells to hide his drug activities as the season progresses.

This series is not for children--there are extremely harrowing scenes of the aftereffects of an IED explosion, of a fierce gunfight, and of graphic effects of drug use and addiction.  For those of age, though, ""Breaking Bad"" is an extremely rewarding series--there is great use of symbolism and the show has unexpected plot twists as well as outstanding scenes from the New Mexico desert.  Above all, it probes moral issues by negative example, offering lessons on how not to deal with adversity, fear, and uncertainty.",1367366400,,2641,5.450980392156863

3780775,5,B001RTSPVY,"This ""Breaking Bad"" season was a gift for a friend. I naturally also gave them The Complete First Season first! as a present.
Why share this crude, ""low-life"" theme?
This series is so expertedly put together!  It is difficult to analyse WHY given the subject matter,is so good.
I can mention several factors that may have ""hooked"" me to such an unlikely series, with such ""low-life"" subject matter!
I wanted to share this series.
The ""hero"" was a lawbreaker with a capital ""L"" , yet, he had his own sort of integrity and values or agenda which he put
as a higher priority to the ""LAW""! namely . . . the survival of his family after his death! His genius ideas for Chemistry had been stolen from him by a so-called friend and ""society"" was rewarding this ""friend"" while HE with his unappreciated gifted intelligence was being treated as a slave by society . . . the same society. . . that backs up the ""LAW""! The world is pretty absurd anyway and
this situation about the hero and his priorities becomes understandable. We can't help but sympathize with him on his dangerous
quest to make millions of ""big Bucks""  out of a potentially lethal situation! He is doing it for altruistic reasons. He is very unselfish.
Bryan Cranston with his understated personality portrayal is very good casting. The other actresses and actors are really well
cast. The situations are bizarre yet believable and convincing.
Bryan Cranston's role was like a mouse trying to get the cheese from the trap and not get hurt. He had to outsmart so many
people we are sure he will fail! Just when things look most bleak for him a tiny little triumph due to his own intelligent and calm
reasoning help him out of the impossible situation and we breath a sigh of relief!
Everyone needs him and wants him to be perfect! Who is perfect? No one not even the Chemistry teacher. Another sigh of relief
for the audience.
He keeps his mouth shut and forgets his own ego when most would be tempted to talk about themselves. We have to admire
this trait.
The roles of all the players were so well and realistically portrayed. There was a lot to enjoy about this series. I am really looking
forward to when the fifth series comes out on DVD in PAL frequency as that is my frequency.",1364947200,,2243,4.5358024691358025

The story is based off a chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with cancer and wants to make some money to leave behind for his family.  He decides to cook crystal meth with his chemistry background and cooks the best stuff the world has ever seen.  From the very first episode of the first season, they squeeze what could be a whole season into one episode and it leaves you wondering what could happen next.

3780860,5,B001RTSPVY,"What more could I say?  Just another awesome season, the one where we first meet Mike Ehrmantraut.  Walt shows to what lengths he will go to to keep from being exposed.  He didn't actually kill the girl but he stood there and did nothing while she died.  At the same time, he seemed to be trying to decide what to do while watching her OD and stop breathing.  Right up to the end we weren't sure if he would raise the alarm and get her medical help or just let her die.  It wasn't his fault because after all it was just a coincidence he was even there at the time she did OD.  On the other hand, just about anyone else would have called 911 instead of allowing a young woman to die right in front of them, so it was pretty cold.  After this season I just couldn't wait to watch 3.",1357430400,,781,4.025974025974026

3780900,5,B001RTSPVY,This is my favorite show ever. Amusing entertaining with a right dose of darkness. But behind the darkness is a realism that's scary layered and engaging.  Leaves you thinking and wanting more. Funny how the objective to make money is portrayed as one step forward and two steps back.

This is the best multi-layered work I've seen from TV in a long time.

3780938,5,B001RTSPVY,"During the first season, we come to see how Bryan Cranston's character (acted brilliantly, by the way) could not be any more desperate. And just when you think things couldn't get more low, in comes season two with more problems and more desperation.

I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this season, but my God, if you haven't seen it, get this DVD collection it will be so worth your time.",1345680000,,399,4.465753424657534
3780939,5,B001RTSPVY,"Walt (Emmy winner Bryan Cranston)drifts further into evil losing himself in Heisenberg his drug manufacturing alter ego as he and Jessie (Emmy winner Aaron Paul)fill the void left by the death of drug lord Tuco (Raymond Cruz from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Closer-The-Complete-Seventh-Season/dp/B004UXVDJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Closer: The Complete Seventh Season</a>). A new drug boss Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito who deserves an Emmy for his performance) is introduced while Skylar (Anna Gunn) ends up returning to work for her former boss Ted (Christopher Cousins)with unexpected consequences.

The second season of ""Breaking Bad"" was where the show truly found itself (the first season is exceptional as well)setting up events that will play out over the next two seasons. As the seasons have progressed we've seen Walt become darker what's amazing is how Bryan Cranston has managed to continue to make Walt both sympathetic and destestable at the same time. It's a difficult trick for any actor to pull of (hence his Emmy awards much deserved for his performances throughout the series)but Cranston wouldn't be able to keep the show afloat by himself; he has terrific support from ALL the members of the cast and there isn't a weak link among them.

The second season looks even better than the first--with a pretty strong presentation the New Mexico blue skies positively pop, blacks are pretty strong and detail is exceptionally good.

Audio sounds marvelous with an impressive lossless presentation. Dialog is pefectly clear throughout and subtitles in English and French (strangely no Spanish)and SDH English.

Special features are scattered over all three discs with the majority on disc three. We get four audio commentaries featuring Cranston, Gunn, RJ Mitte and others as well as members of the creative team (writer-producer-creator Vince Gilligan). We also get deleted scenes. There's also a music video for the song ""Negro Y Azul"" which is odd considering that it opens the episode of the same name.

We also get the full ""Better Call Saul"" commericial, gag reel, ""Cop Talk with Dean Norris"" interviewing their police consultants. We also get six webisodes. ONce again we get ""Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery"" as well as some assorted short featurettes.

The second season of ""Breaking Bad"" builds on the excellent first season with richer, deeper performances and creator Gilligan is able to expand on the storyline introduced during the shorter season one building credible, fascinating characters and putting together a fascinating twisted modern morality play where Walt continually chooses the wrong path.",1345334400,,2683,5.57985257985258

3780941,5,B001RTSPVY,"I loved the first season of Breaking Bad, but I have to admit, I wasn't hooked.  By the end of the second season, I was so hooked I couldn't contain myself!  Breaking Bad is a quiet low key show that packs a wallop.  Everything is quiet on the show including the sound, the people and the addictions.  The show is not held up by loud music but gentle sounds.  A kid shoots a drug dealer, a teddy bear is inexplicably immersed in water, two bodies are in body bags in a drive way, the images are compelling and the noise is soft.  Our protagonist is Walter White, a high school Chemistry teacher with a sterling reputation.  He has lung cancer which is terminal and gets into dealing meth to make money for his family after he is gone.  In this season, his wife is unexpectedly pregnant after years of infertility.  His son is in high school and Walt has mixed feelings about him because of his cerebral palsy.  Walt has been making money to get treatments for his cancer and appears to have taken a turn for the better.  Questions are being asked by his wife about the money and a possible 2nd cell phone which appears after Walt disappears in a fugue state and is found naked in a grocery store.  The story the series tells in season 2 is of a man who is getting more into drug dealing and making money from it while his original reason is fading and less important.  An advantage of watching the DVD is having access to the commentary which is fascinating and involving.  Deleted scenes and short documentary for most episodes are included.  All are worthwhile.

3780952,5,B001RTSPVY,"Emotionally, this TV series is very hard to follow.
A decent man in Albuquerque, 50 y old chemistry teacher, 'breaks bad' after a diagnosis of lung cancer. His wife is pregnant, his teenage son handicapped. He thinks he must leave them something and stumbles into the drugs business.
He teams up with a former student and starts a meth lab. As a producer he is an instant success. His product is superb. He takes the pseudonym Heisenberg and becomes an underworld celebrity. However, business is more than production. On the distribution side, his small team hits one disaster after the other. One step forward, two steps back.
The harder he works at commercial success, the further away he moves from his original purpose. He risks losing his family in the process, when his wife senses that all is not right.
His self diagnosis is focused on the loss of fear: he had been a coward for 50 years, until the cancer cured him. He has lost fear, and may lose everything else. Fear has a role in evolution and civilization.

I have no idea if the details of his business and of the law enforcement side, which we follow via the brother in law, who is a DEA agent and a bit of the clown of the series, is an accurate picture of the real world. It is fearsome and scary. Better not to lose that fear.",1339286400,2,1294,4.459915611814346
3780953,5,B001RTSPVY,"I like it, especially being able to watch it at my own pace, without commercials.
not watching much tv, I cannot compare it to anything else.  It does stand on its own.
What's to say that hasn't been said, I like the connection to the real world, as in, this could happen.  it brings out some great points on things to think about, like health insurance in the usa.  One stretch on realism is that everyone I know in teaching has very good health insurance.  Another thought provoking topic is dealing with cancer.  I am learning a few things about it, and dealing with my friend's cancer helps me to consider things that she is going through, and how to accept and respond to her fears and situation.  The entertainment part of it is great, a chemistry high school teacher and his real life application of his knowledge, and how he adapts and handles his problems. Lots of side stories brought in for a well diverse story all around the central story, such as the petty theft by Walt's sister in law, the turtle in the desert,  Walt Jr and his cerebral palsy, even the lawyer,  lots of things for consideration.
A what could be look at a real life side of illegal drugs, what it does to a person, family,... especially Jane, Jane's father,  as well as the business side of it, especially Jesse's street friends.  an intelligent main character, Walter, and cast, written by intelligent writers, put together and presented in an entertainingly intelligent way.",1338768000,3,1459,4.642023346303502
3780954,5,B001RTSPVY,"American culture prefers happy stories, to the point that nearly everything on network tv is about as deep as an empty suburban swimming pool. Fortunately, we have alternatives.

Breaking Bad is the story of Walt White, former brilliant graduate student turned high school chemistry teacher.  His life is bland and unsatisfying, and Walt keeps it chugging along by hiding his many dissatisfactions under a mild facade. He says that he loves his wife, but the couple occupy distant universes.

When Walt learns he has late stage cancer he chooses to forgo treatment. His family stages an intervention and, in a moment of rare honesty, Walt tells them that in his entire life, he has never made his own choices. The intervention ends with Walt acceding to his wife Skyler's demand that he undergo chemotherapy. Believing that he has only a couple of years to live, he sets out to give his family a financial security that they lack. Through his DEA brother in law he learns about the money to be made cooking meth. During a ride-along, he meets a former student turned meth peddler; they form a partnership in the crystal meth trade.

The world of a meth cook, while grim and uncertain, is stripped of the petty deceits that made his previous life possible. Unable to tell his family what he's doing, he lies. And the lies slowly rip his old life apart.

It's a painful story to watch, but an honest one. Well written and acted, as it is, it is also impossible to turn away.

Good, honest storytelling always has something to tell us about what it means to be human in a particular time and place. And Breaking Bad is superb story telling.",1337904000,7,1637,4.666666666666667

Now about 'Breaking Bad'! If for some reason you haven't seen it; watch season 1 ASAP! Next 2, 3, etc...

One warning: The violence is graphic. I mean REALLY graphic. I cover my eyes and ask my husband ""What's happening?!? WHAT'S HAPPENING?!?!?"" Drives him crazy. Not every episode is violent I don't believe because the violence is not for violence's sake. It's because everything in the story is so REAL--TOO real--which is what makes it great. My husband and I are not the types to get addicted to a show, but Breaking Bad is more of an experience.  LOVE IT!!!!

Brian Cranston is remarkable as the science teacher turned genius meth chemist, Giancarlo Espisito plays a great sociopathic fast food entrepeneur/drug kingpin and Bob Odenkirk is absolutely perfect as sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman.

Psyched for the new season to come out.  I've been blown away with every episode.  Love it!",1331510400,2,517,4.171717171717172

3780964,5,B001RTSPVY,The Complete Second Season of Breaking Bad was everything I thought it would be and so much more.  The writers are wonderful and I love the different situations that Walter and Jesse get themselves into...well it's usually Jesse causing the problem because of how dumb he is and Walter coming to the rescue.  The characters are believable esp. the wife and the brother-in law Hank.  He so personifies his role with his bigoted attitude against criminals of different ethnic backgrounds but also gets creeped out by some things but has to put on a show in front of his co-workers about how big and bad he is.  All in all watching this series has left me wanting more.  Can't wait for season three to be repeated on tv or else I will most likely order it.,1330646400,,753,4.507352941176471
3780965,5,B001RTSPVY,"Breaking Bad's second season is darker than the first.  There are some humorous moments (usually at Jesse's expense), but overall this season is much more ""intense"".

""The Sopranos"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"" are entertaining crime dramas, but they don't pull me in the way this show does. I know of no other TV series or movie about an illegal enterprise where you actually witness the ""business"" being put together, almost in real time, while the law desperately scrambles to stop it. That whole process in itself makes for fascinating viewing.

Again, this series in no way glorifies drug taking or drug trafficking (quite the opposite), and it's pretty interesting how they manage to make this seem so viscerally realistic without excess profanity or violence.

I don't want to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul continue to be amazing together onscreen.  Anna Gunn gets more screen time, as do Dean Norris and RJ Mitte - and this season they further prove how great the entire cast is.

I'll just conclude by saying that the last episode of season two is heartbreaking to watch, but up to this point,  Breaking Bad is one of the best shows I've ever seen and definitely merits repeated viewing.",1329350400,4,1254,4.859154929577465

It's addicting, groundbreaking and cinematic. It's filmed, written and produced not like a TV show but like one very, very long movie.

3780988,5,B001RTSPVY,"In a nutshell, the story is about a high school chemistry teacher/husband/father who finds out he has terminal cancer. Realizing his family will be burdened beyond belief after his death, he sets out to secure their financial future by cooking and selling crystal meth with what little time he has left. Encountering all the problems one would expect from the situation, he seeks out and employs a former student of his who is a small-time CM dealer/user, all while trying to keep his cancer and newfound ""hobby"" a secret from his wife and DEA agent brother-in-law.

The writing is superb. Just further proving that all of the best creative work right now is in 60-minute TV, not films. The acting is fantastic - Bryan Cranston walks away with the Best TV Actor award each year. The show is also far and away above all others in their artistic use of light and camera.

But here's the thing: I've never seen a better ""save the cat"" show in my life. It's one thing for a show to place their characters in seemingly impossible situations but it's an entirely different thing to be able to  creatively get the characters out all while maintaining believability. Despite the absolutely absurd situations these characters put themselves in, at no point do you question their motives or their decision making.

Yes, this is what would happen if this person tried to do this. Yes, this is how they would behave.

And it's always nothing short of fascinating.

I originally thought they would take a more absurdist/comedic POV to the story but, to my surprise, they went in the opposite direction. The story goes to some very dark, very real places. There were points in season 2 (I watched seasons 1 & 2 on DVD) when I had to pause the show and walk away from it for 5-10 minutes because it was simply too intense.

Fair warning: as good as the writing and acting are this show probably isn't for the ultra squeamish. How would a high school chemistry teacher dispose of a body? What would such a person realistically have to do to become a major drug player? The creators don't dodge any questions and don't make it easy on the characters.",1317600000,11,2133,4.641909814323608

Anyways, this season is my favorite of all three because it is a journey into the heart of darkness. Walt, the meth cook king,  becomes Scarface and ruins the life of many for the sake of his selfish reasons. Jesse has a sight at freedom but is pulled back into the abyss due to Walter's actions. Hank are on the trail of Heisenberg while Walt's family starts to pull away. the ending to the season is among the most shocking ever.

This drama brings to the screen the vivid reality of human pride and it's rippling effects on the world around us. The character ""Walt"" shows us how we can let pride fester within us from losing a love early in his life to another, and allowing it to rationalize the refusal of heartfelt help in a time of need. How pride, unchecked, can cause the death and destruction of countless lives.

3781015,4,B001RTSPVY,"The first season of 'Breaking Bad' was easily one of the most addicting shows on TV. The story of a high school teacher, 'Walt' who's diagnosed with a serious case of cancer and finds his calling in the drug-trade is hard to resist. This second season of 'Breaking Bad' is just as addictive with an even longer season (13 episodes) but sometimes takes a bit too much for granted.

The story of 'Breaking Bad' season two picks up exactly where season one left off. Walt and his former student Jesse have gone into business with drug dealer Tuco and end up getting in way over their heads, even as their drug gives them a strong rep on the streets. Adding to this both Walt and Jesse's personal lives are becoming deeply effected, especially Walt's relationship with his wife and son. The one thing I love about this show is how nothing Walt and Jesse (and any of the other characters) do or scheme is without consequence and watching their plans 'almost' succeed or change in unpredictable ways is a pure delight. Unfortunately as well thought-out as the episode's plots are, the credibility is stretched pretty thin to service the plot: characters start behaving unbelievably, certain situations play out in ways that you KNOW isn't possible (even in the show's sense) and the plots follow a few too many red-herrings (which don't seem to have much point). The dark sense of humor is still intact, but the sinking likability of characters will no doubt test the dedication of some fans.

Like the first season, this DVD set of Breaking Bad season 2 comes with some great extras. The usual behind the scenes features are there with some fun gag reels. The best addition is the hilarious ""webisodes"" which were originally only available (free) online.

The same strengths of the first season of 'Breaking Bad' are here with stellar acting by the entire cast and some engagingly gritty scenes of violence and the drug-world. While I felt season 2 wasn't as satisfying as the first, this DVD set is still a must-buy and won't disappoint fans.",1301097600,2,2038,4.751412429378531

This is a cinematic show with visibly high production value, creative camera angles, and beautiful cinematography (the cactus and sand of the New Mexico desert are palpable in 1080p) rarely seen on TV. Cranston and Paul as the two leads are spectacularly talented professionals (3 consecutive Emmys for Cranston, 1 for Paul) that make one of the most memorable odd couple partners in crime in TV/film history, taking the ""fish out of water"" motif to shocking new levels of intensity. Great photography and stellar acting aside, the story lines in Breaking Bad are spellbinding, and Gilligan really excels at putting his characters in impossible situations and making the audience squirm as we wonder how things could have gone so horribly wrong.

There's a lot of humor interwoven with the more serious themes which I can understand or this would be unwatchable. The emotional arc of the main character, a borderline genius, is one of the more refreshing elements to watch. Think from caterpillar to butterfly (but in a bad way). Good to great supporting cast (Hank is the best). For the second season there aren't as many clever uses of chemistry which drops this down from B plus to A minus to B plus. More focus on the personal relationships of character.  It has won several Emmies since 2008, including PeaBody Award (2008) and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (2010).

3781023,5,B001RTSPVY,"Season 2 picks up the moment when Season 1 ended with Walter White and Jesse Pinkman stood in the junkyard with the psychotic drug baron Tuco having beaten to death one of his henchmen for nothing. From there we're taken on a whirlwind tour of 13 of the best episodic drama series ever written.

Haunting black and white images of a burned purple teddy appear throughout the series, teasing the viewer at a tantalising finale. Walt's cancer gets worse prompting him to do more desperate things to get money quicker for his family, while Jesse falls in love with a recovering drug addict.

As Walt and Jesse's operation grows they recruit more of Jesse's druggie friends and we meet a charismatic but crooked lawyer who helps the duo launder their ill-gotten gains. Skyler begins suspecting what her husband is up to during all this time while getting closer to term with her pregnancy, and all the while Walt's brother in law Hank the DEA agent is getting closer to discovering who is producing this new high quality blue meth...

Incredibly, Season 2 is better than Season 1 and is twice as long so the characters are given more room to become interesting and develop, the storylines get fleshed out, and the studio has given the crew more money so everything is done on a larger scale.

I loved the new additions to the cast - Jesse's friends, his love interest and her father (played by the brilliant John De Lancie) and the crooked lawyer played by Bob Odenkirk was a wonderful highlight as well.

There are so many exceptional scenes it's impossible to list them here. The writing is as amazing as always, the acting is as strong as ever and the entire series is a joy to watch from start to finish. Utterly entrancing and wonderful television, I highly recommend this series to fans of high quality drama and to any who are uncertain as to whether or not they want to buy this after Season 1.

 I enjoyed the great acting, everything was very believable and that is important in a story or movie plot. OK, there were a few times when you think to yourself, ""oh really? Can someone really be that good or lucky?"", but that is what adds to the entertainment value I think.
So the characters are believable and likable and you end up rooting for them to suceed.
It is a drama with normal life humor interlaced into it, the characters have their ups and downs and you take the thrill ride right along with them.

 This entire series (season 1-3) has been very enjoyable for me, I ended up watching one episode after another while being snowbound this winter. It was a great way to make being trapped indoors very pleasant.

3781031,4,B001RTSPVY,"Season 1 of Breaking Bad was outstanding, and for much of this season, the same can be said.  Character development is improved, and this is especially beneficial for Jessie and Hank--these two are no longer the one note stereotypes the series started them out with.  Jessie, a hyperactive annoyance with a lack of brain power in Season 1, expands his emotional range and depth in Season 2, and Hank, who was a Vic Mackey clone with very little gray area in Breaking Bad 1.0, now has some extra layers, as well as an expanded (and highly entertaining) DEA plot arc.

What else is improved?  Overall creativity in the film-making.  From ominous flash forwards, trippy montages cued to expertly chosen music, some incredible cold opens (including a music video), and excellent use fast-motion fixed camera shots, the show has become the best made, most unique-looking experience on television.  Furthermore, it boasts one of the great all-time episodes: ""4 Days Out,"" which is a standalone pressure-cooker and my personal favorite so far.

So with all this praise, what goes wrong?  For most viewers, the consensus appears to be nothing, but I believe there were some significant missteps.  Without revealing too many SPOILERS, the following issues were significant enough to drop the rating down one star:

1.) In the last quarter of the season, the meth-making angle takes a long hiatus, and the show suffers from a lack of criminal tension (which has previously fueled much of the suspense and success of Breaking Bad as a whole).
2.) Jessie's girlfriend is a bit of a cliched plot device--existing as a surrogate tension-maker for the evaporating drug dealing angle--without her, Walt and Jessie wouldn't have any new conflicts.  She essentially becomes a ""Wormtongue"" and is drawn in fairly broad strokes.
3.) The ominous flash forwards.  Were they executed well?  Absolutely.  Was I dying to see what they actually pertained to in the finale?  For sure.  Was there a pay off?  In my opinion, while the unveiling was clever, I do not believe the entire season should surround and build up to such a purely metaphorical (but from a plot standpoint unimportant) moment in time.

Regardless of my personal opinion of the last quarter of the season, the show as a whole, the style of film making, and the addictive (meth like?) quality of the episodes make this my favorite diversion on television.  I may be critical of some small areas of development, but Breaking Bad is top notch.",1293580800,2,2483,4.954106280193237

Bryan Cranston proves himself to be one of the finest actors working these days, the real shame is that he hasn't been given roles to sink his teeth into before this one.

3781035,5,B001RTSPVY,"Bryan Cranston continues to revel in his second ""role of a lifetime"" - the first being Hal in the comic gem ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" and now as America's favorite beleaguered chemistry teacher, Walt White.  ""Breaking Bad - Season 2"" continues creator Vince Gilligan's magnificant exploration of how modern man fights back against fate.

A grim sense of foreboding stalks the second season of AMC's surprise hit show.  Each of the thirteen episodes starts with a brief prologue - often without any dialogue - that hints at the trials to come.  By far the creepiest of these scenes are the repeated shots of a jarringly pink teddy bear (the only part of these scenes shot in color - the rest of shots are in black-and-white) with one eye ripped from its socket floating in what looks like Walt's swimming pool, only to be swept up by a criminal investigatory team.  We have no idea whose teddy bear it is or how it got there - but it's clear that this can't be good news for Walt.

In many ways, Season 2 shows how Walt keeps jumping from the frying pan to safety, only to realize that he's landed on another frying pan.  He's still sick with cancer, and now he's coughing blood.  His product is still the best on the market, but the dealer connection he forged at the end of Season One is fraught with danger - Tuco is more than a bit unstable.  His sidekick Jesse continues to skirt just on the responsible side of ruin.  And his wife Skylar is getting both more pregnant and suspicious every day.

Can Walt stay healthy long enough to build a nest egg for his family?  Can he escape the casual, senseless death that takes so many drug dealers?  Can he continue to fly under the radar of his DEA-agent brother-in-law, who is unwittingly hunting for Walt in the guise of Heisenberg?  Can he keep the mounting lies straight?

All these questions provide for riveting, if grim, television.  Season Two is a profane and violent season, but it is one of the most intelligent and emotional seasons of TV we have seen in years.  Cheers to all concerned - this is must-see TV.",1285113600,,2068,4.516129032258065

3781040,5,B001RTSPVY,"""Breaking Bad"" isn't in the same exalted ranks as ""The Sopranos"", but it's good enough and different enough to easily get five stars.

Vince Gilligan, the series' creator, says it can be viewed as a comedy, and the first two episodes are blackly funny throughout. The tone is Hitchcockian, and Gilligan borrows freely from The Master, even going back as far as ""The Lodger"". I leave it to you to find the other references and takings. (The following episodes are more-fitfully funny, with the theft of the methylamine being the most-broadly humorous.)

The most-obvious Hitchcockian element is having the audience thoroughly identify with the character we /aren't/ supposed to identify with -- Walter White. He didn't /need/ to cook meth -- his former business partner would have covered his medical expenses -- but he does it anyway. Gilligan enhances our sympathy for Walter by surrounding him with thoroughly unlikeable and/or stupid people * -- his sister-in-law (a shoplifter), his brother-in-law (a macho DEA cop), his drug-dealer associate (who, as they say, couldn't pour piss from a boot if the instructions were printed on the bottom), and worst of all, his wife. Skyler White (her name ""says it"") is a self-centered, judgemental, ungrateful person who's more interested in ""communicating"" with her husband than in loving and supporting him. When Walter is finally willing to tell her everything, she refuses to listen: ""I don't think I could handle it."" (What did he ever see in her? What did he ever do to deserve such an uncaring b****?) The only sympathetic major character is Walter's son, played charmingly by R J Mitte.

Gilligan also borrows another Hitchcock theme -- we never /really/ know what's going through the minds of the seemingly ""good"" people we associate with. Much of ""Breaking Bad"" riffs on this theme.

Gilligan has no problem appropriating scenes from famous films, such as ""GoodFellas"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"". He doesn't do this often enough to be annoying, though.

The quality of acting is not particularly high. John de Lancie, an actor I normally don't much care for, gives an understated and effective performance as the father of a junkie, and Bob Odenkirk is just plain wonderful as a corrupt lawyer with high ethical standards, but most of the actors (especially Christopher Cousins) seem to have been rounded up at a garage sale, Aaron Paul being the principal exception.

Bryan Cranston pretty much carries the series. The scripting is rarely less than acceptable -- but similarly hardly ever inspired. For Cranston, it doesn't need to be, because he's given many opportunities to /show/ us, with his face and body, what his character is thinking, rather than reading lines. It's a solid performance.

There are surprising technical errors. An explosion strong enough to blow out windows would also likely blow out the eardrums of anyone present. And it's unlikely that two gallons of hydrofluoric acid would be enough to dissolve a human body /and/ take out the tub and the floors beneath. It's such nasty stuff that it's /highly unlikely/ gallon jugs of it would be sitting in the supply room of a high-school chemistry lab.

* It took a while to figure this out. My initial reaction was that the actors were either miscast or poor actors. But the characterizations appear to be intentional.",1281052800,,3346,5.048913043478261

3781044,1,B001RTSPVY,"I feel kinda bad giving this a one-star review as I feel the first series was compelling and superbly-crafted (especially the first three or four episodes), but the bottom line is I couldn't get through more than about half of the second season:  I just got so sick of the writers' same lame tricks.

What tricks?

It seemed as if, in some scriptwriting workshop, the writers had been told the importance of having CONFLICT on the screen.  You gotta have AGON!  You can't simply have people getting along and life going swell:  people have to be arguing.

But it's as though the writers never made it to the second chapter of that screenwriting book, wherein you learn that agon must arise insuppressibly out of character and circumstance.  Instead, it's like whenever things get slow, they had one character or another start acting irrational just to keep the tension up.  It got so predictable.  At one point, Jesse asks Walt, ""Hey, 6 grand a day we're making! What's your problem?!""

It would have been very accurate if Walt had simply retorted: ""Hey, I have to have a problem of some sort!  The script is kinda lagging at this point and we need some yelling to keep the tension up!""

In other words, despite its many merits (especially acting), I think this is a good example of a TV show with a premise but no story.  They've got a set-up, but they have no idea what to do with it, so they just keep having the characters go at each other for silly stuff just to keep the drama up.

I was totally willing to believe that these two were cooking and selling drugs:  what I was totally unable to swallow was that they'd been cooking and selling drugs for a long time, totally getting away with it, WHILE ALL THE TIME being irresponsible, irrational hotheads who start yelling at each other, showing up in places they aren't supposed to be, and acting in impulsive, improvident ways.  No, no:  people who really do stuff like this and get away with it for years are cautious, circumspect, low-key, and even risk-averse.

Interestingly, the point where I turned it off was where Walt starts banging on Jesse's door, creating a totally unnecessary and dangerously risky scene.  I might have been able to buy that hair's-breadth escape at Tuco's grandfather's, but, strange as it sounds, Walt pounding on the door like that stretched believability way too far.",1279497600,16,2358,4.677184466019417

3781047,5,B001RTSPVY,"Season 2 picks up right where Season 1 left off, with Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) cranking out meth for Tuco, the local drug dealer who uses his product all too frequently and acts unpredictably and irrationally as a result.  Meanwhile, Walter's DEA brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris) continues his hunt for the supplier of blue meth, a man later revealed to go by the name of Heisenberg which, of course, is Walter White's name for his alter ego.

In this season, the relationship between Walt and his immediate family degrades while that with Jesse oscillates all over the place, primarily due to Jesse's spiral into increased drug use.  Walt and Jesse's problems only magnify, however, when they are forced to bring in outside parties to help them with their business.

Danny Trejo guest stars in a disturbing episode where Hank heads down to Juarez to assist a nearby DEA branch.  In addition, Bob Odenkirk (of ""The Ben Stiller Show"" fame) comes on as a new character, a ""criminal"" lawyer who helps Walt and Jesse with various problems.  A bearded John de Lancie (Q from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") appears in several episodes as the father of Jesse's new girlfriend.  He does a fabulous job of playing the girl's tortured, loving father.

This is one of the best shows ever made for TV (and trust me, I've seen my fair share).  Better than ""The Shield,"" ""Mad Men,"" ""Rome,"" ""Battlestar Galactica"" (the new one), ""Burn Notice,"" ""Dexter"" (which is PDG, too), ""Damages,"" ""True Blood,"" ""Deadwood,"" ""Life,"" ""24,"" ""Lost,"" ""The Unit,"" ""Sons of Anarachy"" and ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.""

SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT
I loved the first season of this show. The premise sounded so improbable - a 50 year old high school chemistry teacher with a pregnant wife and a teenage son with cerebral palsy is diagnosed with lung cancer. He goes on a ride along with his DEA agent brother in law and sees an old student fleeing the house where the meth is being cooked. He sees the huge amounts of money to make in the meth trade. Since he's uninsured he decides to go into the meth business - he'll be the cook and his ex-student the dealer. Most meth dealers are not the kind of people you want to spend time with or even think about, but Brain Crandon (sp?) makes the protagonist sympathetic - an every man who has been screwed by life. Even the street dealer is someone you identify with, a young man who is a big disappointment to his family and trying to prove himself, albeit in a criminal enterprise. The chemistry between them is great, and they have many laugh out loud funny scenes. The whole cast is excellent.

Season 2 started out in the same general vein, but towards the end veered off into something really disturbing and depressing. If the writers were trying to be more realistic about the ravages of meth on the customers, and the ruthlessness of the dealers, they succeeded. Walter White, the main character becomes ruthless to the point of cruelty even to his own son (getting him drunk at a family party celebrating his cancer going into remission) and trying to pick a fight his brother in law, who has been nothing but good to him.

3781053,5,B001RTSPVY,"A bold claim, I know.  But, what Breaking Bad did well in Season 1 (maybe better than anything else on at that time as well) it ramps up and hits its stride in Season 2.  There may be shows that do ""comedy"" better, ""drama"" better, ""buddy-interaction"" better, but when all the ingredients are cooked up in the Breaking Bad kitchen, its sum is even better than its high-quality parts.

There is a tension throughout Breaking Bad, even in the smallest things, that makes the show at times exhausting, but it has a perfection to all 13 episodes that I can't recall in many years of TV.  There are a lot of quality shows on these days, and if you read my review of Season 1, you'll know I firmly believe it is the Golden Age of television.  Still, there are breakout shows that trump even the greats, and this little 13 episode series about a meth-cooking terminal high school chemistry teacher manages to bring a depth to it that I don't think the most high-dollar, CGI effect, big-name actor shows and movies can touch.

The many twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Several times I've said, no way!  I can't believe that just happened.  Very edgy stuff.  I like the way the episodes are layered where they stand on their own, but have flashbacks and build upon earlier episodes. Very subtle hints are dropped along the way that make you want to go back and review the previous episodes.  This series has a Miami-vice like style and the music and preludes at the beginning are haunting especially the Negro y Azul episode.  The whole thing just works and keeps you hooked wanting to see what happens next.  The BluRay transfer has a bit of grain, but very sharp and contrast is good.  The extras and behind the scenes stuff is cool.  The only glitch I came across is that on Season 2 disc 3, it prompts you to insert disc 2 for some of the xtras. Doh!

3781059,2,B001RTSPVY,"I dunno what show you people are reviewing, but it is obviously Season 1 (brilliant masterpiece), and not Season 2 (tepid cliche) of ""Breaking Bad.""

The character development, dark humor, nail-biting suspense, and ingenious plot devices... all gone, replaced by an endless segue from ""soap drama moment to soap drama moment."" Look at the actors, they -know- it's dreck they are phoning in. Tell me you can't see it in almost every scene.

Completely extraneous subplots are introduced (Skyler's work flirtation, ill-fated romance between Jesse and ""OD waiting to happen"" girl) that add -nothing- to the basic premises developed so well in Season 1 other than perhaps to appeal to the teenaged female vampire melodrama set. In fact, the gripping, absurdly believable ""dying chemistry teacher meth cook"" premise is all but back-burnered while we get to watch ""touching"" scenes of Sonograms, young flirtation and love, endless cancer conferences (yay! feelgood moment!), and endlessly verbose hyper-dialogue drama moments one can almost hear an ""awww!"" ""booo!"" or ""tada!"" after.

To add insult to injury whoever wrote this mess decided that a highly coincidental plane crash needed to be added in as opposed to developing the very solid core concepts Season 1 was laden with. They could have put this show on auto-pilot by continuing awesome themes from Season 1 (boorishness of the bro in law, kleptomania of the sis in law, interaction with students in class v meth cook, ballsy use of dark side MacGuyver type tech to screw a-holes over... all interesting and smart, all tossed away inexplicably in favor of pure formulaic dreck).

Instead they neutered a masterpiece and drained every loving ounce of testosterone out of the show. Don't be fooled by viral marketing shills posting ""objective"" reviews here, three stars is a stretch for this tedious snooze, I gave it two because it is so very obvious that many of the fives are shall we say ""bought and sold.""",1274400000,20,1961,5.099688473520249

Anna Gunn IS best actress, and Aaron Paul(no awards??) is over the top great as Cranston's druggie partner.

Breaking Bad is one of those rare creations that takes the darkest of circumstances and brings them to a place where you can care for, understand and empathize with the ""everyman"" cast of characters while not glossing over the collateral damage of their incredibly poor choices. Addictive seems too obvious an adjective to describe the series but probably is the most fitting.

I would recommend watching Season 1 if you haven't already to provide you with the backstory (so as to not miss the references in Season 2); however it would not be necessary since the Second Season is powerful enough on its own.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Bad-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001DJLCRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Bad - The Complete First Season</a>

If you like 'Rescue Me' and 'The Sopranos' you should love this show. It's one of the best written shows on TV with great characters, dialogue, drama with a nice touch of comedy.

This season is twice as long as the first, so the stories are much more elaborate. I had read that Aaron Paul was first thought to be a side character in a couple of episodes, but because of the chemistry between the two stars, was written in as a main character. I'm glad they did, as he is every bit as good as Brian Cranston an adds another dimension to the show.

This DVD release has all 13 episodes from season two and lots of nice extras including commentary, deleted scenes and much more. It's a great show worthy of a purchase.

Walt and Jesse experience to the fullest extent what situation they've gotten themselves into and Walt is clearly shown what his actions have caused by the season finale.

3781071,5,B001RTSPVY,"I had read a challenging question once. If you could have one of the following wishes granted, which would you take? Money, Power or Respect. Walt White has none of these advantages but because he has knowledge, Walt is able to score all three. Walt missed his chance to fulfill his potential a long time ago because of stubbornness. Now he has a lifestyle that is very routine and unchallenging. His in-laws seem to remind him of his inadequacies often. As do his high school students who he fails to reach despite his passion for science versus life. When he finds out that he has lung cancer and has a chance encounter with a former student (that he has nothing in common with)... the stage is set to start earning extra money manufacturing drugs.

I was wandering Borders with a 40% coupon and I happened upon Season One of Breaking Bad. I went to Amazon on my phone and discovered the following: About 60 reviews and most of them gave it all 5 stars. Outstanding. In one weekend I watched them all under ideal conditions: I had a cough that wouldn't die. I had empathy for Walter White. The funny thing is, I don't normally like movies about the drug trade. I don't like good people who crash and burn. When that person is reluctant and their decline is spread out over a long period of time, then it's like watching a train wreck in super slow mo. I believe it when it's a process, not a sharp 180 crammed into 46 minutes minus commercials. Also, the way Walt uses his science smarts to turn the tables on his enemies during confrontations makes for the best television I've seen in years. MacGyver insults your intelligence. Walt makes you feel smarter than James Freaking Bond.

Season Two: The best thing I can say is that I jumped when someone rang a bell for service when I was in a little retail setting recently. After season two: the sound of the little desktop bell will make you VERY alert. I bought this set for the extras. I don't know that this show has what I call repeatability. Time will tell. I'm so wrapped up in Season 3 currently that I haven't watched anything twice yet.

My favorite movies of all time involve reluctant heroes. Bryan Cranston masterfully plays a dorky high school science teacher who never found his real potential. An underachiever who turns to the dark side when he is faced with mortality. So often in life we take the path of least resistance when forced to partner up in business, romance or gym class. The partnership of Jesse and Walt could not be more volatile and watching their interaction is often hilarious.

I'm in Season 3 and finally caught up. The karma resonates as Walt's greed compounds. More characters are introduced; each of them affected negatively by the new player in town. Drugs ruin lives and take down a lot of the people connected to the users, dealers and manufacturers. Walt finds himself close to the edge with increasing frequency and when he acts out, it's a pleasure to watch.",1271894400,2,2957,4.573584905660377
3781072,5,B001RTSPVY,"Breaking Bad is one of the best shows on cable TV.  It is witty, funny, sarcastic, and a bit of dark humor.  Walt, the lead character, a high school chemistry teacher, finds out that he has terminal lung cancer.  To pay for his treatment he decides to be a cooker of Meth with a student of his.  That is where the mishaps and the fun begins.

Walt played by Bryan Cranston, the dad in Malcolm in the Middle is funny yet edgy.  Jesse the student is played by a lesser know actor, who is coming into his prime as an actor is comic relief in many ways and his anecdotes are priceless.

Overall this is a great series and should be continued as long as AMC can pay for it.

One other thing to note is that this DVD set is uncut, unlike the cable version, so it is actually a little better than the version seen on cable.  Why a cable network would produce something that gets censored on its network is beyond me, but the DVD captures the full essence of what the director is trying to say.",1271635200,,986,4.147368421052631

3781076,5,B001RTSPVY,"It didn't take long for me to come to the conclusion that ""Breaking Bad"" is one of the best shows I've seen since HBO's ""The Wire,"" and that's no easy feat considering I came to this realization during the first season that was only 7 episodes long (due to the writer's strike).  Those 7 episodes were more than enough to get me hooked.  Well, I have finished the second season and I still hold that very same conclusion.  This season is longer, darker and even more devastating--while still containing all of the dark comedy/humor of Season 1.

I'm not going to go into a long synopsis of the show or season.  There are a lot of surprises and secrets and I would never forgive myself for giving any of them away.  I will be brief about describing the season:  Walt and Jesse get deeper and deeper into the dark and unforgiving drug world that knows of no innocent victims, and every step of the way only gives way to more complications and dangerous predicaments.  While Walt has always participated in this new illegal enterprise with the only reason being that he wants his family to have something after he dies (especially with a new bouncing baby on the way), his moral compass is pushed further and further and he starts to realize that there is a part of him, as much as he doesn't want to admit it, that actually enjoys doing it.  With this season it is more difficult than ever to continue with the lies to keep his family out of the loop... not to mention, keeping them safe.  This season, it's all about chain reactions.  Every act can, and will, create a consequence.

Once again, I found myself invested with the storylines and characters.  I don't think there is an episode where I didn't feel some kind of tension or fear for what could happen next.  A show like this is very hard to pull off and it would be impossible to do so if it wasn't for the terrific writing, directing and casting.  Bryan Cranston is a force to be reckoned with and although his character is growing darker and scarier layers, he is still very much human and you care about him even if he's doing terrible things.  He's not some emotionless or flat character who craves power, and that's what makes the transformation all the more terrifying and heartbreaking.  I also have to say that even though he was outstanding in the first season, Aaron Paul really shines more than ever as ""Pinkman"" in Season 2 and there is an episode called ""Peekaboo"" where he completely owns every frame.  It is one of his best performances ever and this is his best season.

The Blu Ray editon of Season 2 looks and sounds fantastic.  There are TONS of extra features to play around with such as commentary, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, webisodes and much, much more.  You won't find this package to be lacking, that much is for sure.

The second season of ""Breaking Bad"" once again shows us a show that doesn't cut corners or slack in any way.  Every episode is engaging, tense and masterful.  The show continues to be filled with drama, suspense and humor.  If you were a fan of the first season then chances are that you will love what lies ahead in Season 2.  Moving up in the drug world ain't easy, and Walt and Jesse are about to find that out the hard way.  A+ material all the way! - Michael Crane",1271116800,14,3290,4.476510067114094
3781077,5,B001RTSPVY,"This is the bleakest, darkest show on TV.  It would be unbearable if not for the excellent cast, led by the superb Bryan Cranston, the unpredictable plots, and the great dialogue.  The situation remains dire:  Walt still has cancer, coughs a lot--sometimes blood, still cooks the best dope in all of Albuquerque with his goofy partner/distributor, and is getting caught up in the world of drug sales and criminals.  In the meantime, his brother in law, a DEA agent, is brewing beer in his garage when not investigating drug-related crimes.  And Walt's wife and son still have no clue about what he is doing, although he remains a mystery because he's so often gone from the house for long stretches of time.  Walt becomes much more of a hardball this time around, since one has to be made of strong stuff in order to hold one's own in the world of illicit drugs.

The dinging of that old man's bell is unbearably nerve-jangling, and the actor who plays bad guy Tuco Salamanca is incredible.  I will also say that Season Three is shaping up to exceed my expectations.  I wondered how far they could go after Season Two's end, but they made a brilliant decision: to transfer much of the soul-wringing angst of Walter White's internal Civil War onto his wife Skyler.  Amy Gunn is an astounding actress, and I'm not sure the first two seasons scratched the surface of what she can do.

Using methylamine instead of flu medicines was ingenious.  I cannot wait to find out how manufacturing will continue when that barrel of methylamine gets used up.  I am glad the lung cancer regressed by 80% so that many more seasons can be possible.  The doctors cannot take credit for the beneficial effects of the self-administered ""supplementary treatment"".

There is a a legally prescribed pharmaceutical derivative of dTHC (MJ's active ingredient) which does not make the user ""high"", and is used to stop vomiting in chemotherapy and increase survival rates. I have sometimes wondered why big Pharma bothered to invent this product when the real deal is superior. Being ""high"" when the patient is retching away after chemotherapy may be morally reprehensible, but putting morals aside, the natural version works better.  I have blown locks before with thermite in my younger days, so I can tell from experience that the thermite in season One resembled and represented one of superior professional quality and exquisitely made.  Hint: inserting some thermite into the keyhole as well reduces the amount of thermite necessary, and is quieter, although it will not look as dramatic on TV.

I have watched episodes in both seasons so many times I have come to notice that ""Ch"" highlighted with green in the name Michael in the opening credits of each episode is not a chemical element.  ""I"" for iodine could have been used instead in mIchael.  Element 105 Hahnium (Ha) in mic""Ha""el is another alternative, so why ""Ch"".

Using chemical symbols ""Br"" (Bromine) and ""Ba"" (Barium) in the title Breaking Bad was innovative.

Other elements embedded into actors' names include:
N (nitrogen)
O (oxygen)
S (sulphur) and these are the easy ones.

Mo is molybdenum, Es for einsteinium, Re for Rhenium.  We have W for tungsten, V for vanadium, Ar for Argon, Te for tellurium, Po for polonium and so on.

After the first couple of episodes I felt that I knew and understood the Cranston character and was facinated to watch the roller coaster ride his life had turned into for all the right reasons.  The stupidity of the protagonists never disappoints in surprising you with the smartness of the writers and the enjoyable slant of the producers.  The one bare breast in the first episode is not repeated during the first season so don't be put off by that nipple if you are prudish.  Breaking Bad is a smart, thrilling and fast pased roller coaster ride that makes poigniant observation of middle class life and generates genuine sympathy for the lead character that soon has you rooting for him.  I can hardly wait for Season 2 to come out next week.

I put Breaking Bad in the same league as Weeds and (one of my all time favorites) The Wire.",1268438400,,1240,4.341991341991342

3781086,4,B001RTSPVY,"""Breaking Bad"" is a hell of a show. It follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher in New Mexico with terminal lung cancer who decides to use his chemistry prowess to enter the world of crystal meth in an attempt to make as much money for his family as he can before he dies. Sound insane? You bet. But somehow it works.

The second season of a television show is often thought to be the one that makes it or breaks it. In the case of ""Breaking Bad,"" its short first season was excellent, and suggested promise for its outlandish premise, but the second season would be the test of whether the show could really sustain itself. And it passed that test with flying colors.

The second season exceeds the first in every way. The stakes are higher, the premises crazier, and the danger greater than ever. The series still hinges upon Bryan Cranston's pitch-perfect performance as Walter, a wonderfully complex tragic hero whose downfall seems inevitable but for whom you can't help but root nevertheless. Season two finds Walter getting deeper and deeper into the dark world of drugs, and the show takes several dark turns as Walter does things we never imagined him capable of.

This show is one of the best and most innovative ones on television, and hopefully it will continue for some time to come (although, as is always the case with television shows, may it end on a good note before it goes stale). Season three is set to start next month, and it would be a mistake to miss it -- but it would also be a mistake to watch it without having seen the first two seasons, so if you haven't yet entered the dark and whacky world of ""Breaking Bad,"" what are you waiting for?

3781089,5,B001RTSPVY,"What do you get when you take a series that had a great first season, and add it up with its downright brilliant second season? The best damn thing on TV, is what you get.

Vince Gilligan and his crew created something original and daring, I was aware of that the first time I saw the pilot episode. I was immediately fascinated by the use of camera, the clever editing and of course the beautiful scenery - which very quickly became a character of its own.

You get all those things in season two as well, but in addition the writing is as deep as it only is on one other show on TV right now(Mad Men). It's just an entirely different level.
The subject only got uglier this season, there are multiple scenes that are painful to watch, which is a testimonial to the writing and the acting alone - it feels incredibly real, and it is truly gut-wrenching.

Every character has its place in this season. Not only Walt and Jesse are the ones being developed, no, Hank, Marie, Skyler, to name a few, they all are very carefully written and not just being used as meaningless additions to fill some empty spots. Walt's continuing involvement with the drug world drives him further away from his wife Skyler, as he stays out longer and more frequent with no explanations or explanations that are obvious and demeaning lies. This makes for some very powerful scenes.
Hank's career takes an unexpected turn, and becomes surprisingly interesting as he struggles with some shocking events he had to experience - all due to Walt.

The performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are spectacular. This season is a lot more serious than the first. It's a process that began with the very first episode. Walt got himself into a world of trouble and he seems to be pulling down everyone around him, and this season showed some results of that already. This process the actors of course have to adapt to as well, and boy do they adapt fast and flawlessly. Aaron Paul is the breakout star of this season, it's not an easy job to shine when you have to work alongside an actor like Bryan Cranston, but he does. It's a given that both their Emmy nominations, respectively wins, were highly deserved.

There is too much to write about here, this season is packed with brilliant moments. I can obviously not address them all. Let me just say if they manage to continue on this level of quality, Breaking Bad will go down in history as one of the greatest shows of all time, up there with The Sopranos and the likes.

3781091,5,B001RTSPVY,"I'm glad they are finally giving this amazingly filmed show a Blu-Ray release for it's second season and they are going back to release the first season on Blu-Ray as well. The second season of this AMC series starts right where the first dramatic season left off. From there it winds down a dark path where you can't see what's coming while still managing to up the stakes and get you more involved with the characters with each passing episode. While I wasn't quite prepared for where this season ended I have high hopes for the third season that will premiere this winter and highly recommend the first and second seasons to fans of well made television and certainly for fans of this series to rewatch it and notice things they've missed in first viewing. This 3-disc Blu-Ray set will contain the following episodes from season 2 of Breaking Bad (No Spoiler's):

Seven Thirty-Seven
Walt and Jesse try to end their deal with Tuco. Meanwhile, Hank attempts to repair Marie and Skyler's relationship.

Grilled
With Walt and Jesse trapped with Tuco, Marie and Hank comfort Skyler over his disappearance.

Bit by a Dead Bee

Breakage
Hank suffers from the aftermath of his encounter with Tuco. Meanwhile, Jesse hires a crew to get their product out on the streets.

Negro Y Azul
Rumors fly about Jesse's recent actions as he and Walt discuss expanding their business into new territories. Hank struggles to fit in with his new co-workers in El Paso. Skyler pursues a new job opportunity that reconnects her with a former colleague. Jesse gets to know his landlord, Jane

Better Call Saul
When Badger finds himself in trouble with the law, Walt and Jesse seek the legal advice of a shady attorney, Saul Goodman. The DEA believe they may have finally caught up with the elusive 'Heisenberg.' Hank returns to Albuquerque, but his troubled mental state and demeanor cause Marie to worry.

4 Days Out
Walt interrupts Jesse's weekend plans to inform his partner they'll have to cook for four days straight, or risk losing their batch of methylamine. Out in the desert things get heated between them when they wind up stranded.

Over
With Walt's disease in remission, the Whites throw a party for all those who've supported him through the ordeal, but the mood is ruined when Walt and Hank argue.

Phoenix
Skyler deals with newly developed family dynamic. Walter Jr. launches a new website to raise money for the family. Jane convinces Jesse to stand up to Walt. Walt makes a decision, or lack thereof, that sends him further down a path of darkness.

ABQ
Skyler's frustration with Walt's secrecy boils over; Jesse heads further down a path of self-destruction, and only Walt is willing to help him; and a grief-stricken Donald experiences more tragedy. Walt's recent poor decisions have a much larger negative affect on others than he could ever have anticipated.

'Seven Thirty-Seven' is an amazing season opener that leaves one anxiously awaiting the rest of the season. 'Grilled' provides a level of tension and excitement so high it leaves one wondering how the rest of the season will follow. While it does level out excitement-wise from there each episode is amazingly well crafted and dramatic from beginning to end. Other stand out episodes for me this season were '4 Days Out' and 'Mandala'. ABQ is also an incredibly well done season finale that leaves things in total chaos and wide open for the third season. Truly though, every episode stands out as excellently entertaining television making.

But you know what, there are many really good shows out there now, and it can be hard to keep up with all of them. So if you are still undecided as to whether this show is worth an investment of your time and money, I hope this helps.

If are an avid fan of the Sopranos and The Shield, you will love Breaking Bad.

Do you remember how both of those shows would, at their very best, leave you staring at the screen, with your heart pounding, saying to yourself ""Holy S---""?  Well, there are moments like that in Breaking Bad.  Like  the Sopranos, it effectively mixes dark comedy and violence.  Like The Shield, it has episodes and plotlines that are incredibly intense.  And like both of those shows, it features a protagonist leading a double life. The performance of Bryan Cranston, like those of James Gandolfini and Micheal Chiklis is one of the finest ever seen on televison.  Your move.",1258243200,148,1040,4.455026455026455
3781094,5,B001RTSPVY,"I watch A LOT of TV and I can honestly say there has never been a show that was so riveting and so gripping from beginning to end as Breaking Bad. This show is a masterpiece through and through.

During the first season, we come to see how Bryan Cranston's character (acted brilliantly, by the way) could not be any more desperate. And just when you think things couldn't get more low, in comes season two with more problems and more desperation.

I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this season, but my God, if you haven't seen it, get this DVD collection it will be so worth your time.",1254268800,51,595,4.303571428571429
3781095,5,B001RTSPVY,"I wrote a rave review for the first season because of how incredible and sublimely perfect it was. I also pondered whether or not that kind of magic can be duplicated, and feared season 2 would have to be a letdown after a blockbuster first season.

I was so wrong. Season 2 blew season 1 out of the water. It was better in so many ways. Aaron Paul deserved the Emmy nomination because he was fantastic, Cranston once again was light years better than any performance you will see on tv. The editing, cinematography, music cues, scene location, and direction were just so perfectly blended. Everything about season 2 was great.

But it starts with the story, of course. And naturally you're left, after season 1's finale, wondering what direction the show is going to careen off into and carry a mesmerized audience. The conclusion of season 1 left us with a pretty good idea of what was going to happen, and then season 2 went break-neck speed further past that and well beyond. I was stunned at how beautiful and tragic some of the character developments evolved, such as the scene where Jesse's girlfriend dies, the scene just prior to where Walt is at the bar with (unknowingly) the girls father, and then the action Walt takes to save Jesse from his despair. Its madness and yet its so touching. Definitely one of my favorite sequences.

Or the scene where Tuco has Jesse at gunpoint and Jesse mans up and truly breaks bad by actually overpowering the lunatic Tuco. Real solid character development that had me howling for Jesse's triumph.

You can have your reality tv, your lame game shows, your crime dramas  your adult swim whatever. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING compares to this masterpiece. There has never been a show so engaging, thrilling and groundbreaking as this show, and you will never see a show like this as long as you live. Everything pales in comparison, so enjoy this ride while it lasts, because it seems to me Season 3 may just be the end.",1253232000,19,1965,4.635057471264368

This set provides an astounding amount of in depth special features for fans as well as the 13 amazing second season episodes, unlike the first season set which on account of the writer's strike only had seven. It's all at an affordable price and it's shows like this that I feel are most worth owning on DVD or Blu-ray for repeat viewings because they are truly not only entertaining but because they are so layered you see new things each time you rewatch an episode.

3781099,5,B001RTSPVY,"I concur with what has been said before (especially by Bullard and Padillo).  I missed the first season and my interest was piqued by the promo announcments that AMC was going to show all the Season #1 episodes back-to-back-to back, etc.

I stayed up that night and watched all the episodes.  I was hooked!  I made sure I saw the first episode of the 2nd season and watching BREAKING BAD became a Sunday night must do.

Kudos to AMC indeed.  That network should be commended for taking the chance to air this series.  I'm chomping at the bit for Season #3.  It's a great and compelling show.  Bryan Cranston is very deserving of his Emmy.  The character of the DEA agent and the dealer ""Tuco"" are and were outstanding pluses for the series.

I hope the 3rd season continues the high quality of this show.",1250467200,3,804,4.475862068965517
3781100,5,B001RTSPVY,"I would like to give this series 4 stars instead of 5 because I can't say that I enjoy watching it.  However, I can't grade something down because it is too good, too excellent.  It is painful to watch.  This is because the central figure has morphed into being a very tragic figure with nothing but further tragedy looming on the horizon.  Bryan Cranston, previously a situation comedy actor, plays this tragic figure, a high school teacher who learns he has terminal cancer.  His response to this news is a growing and overpowering rage.  He had suppressed this rage up to this point in his life but he had two cancers inside of him.  One was his lung cancer and the other was a cancer of the spirit brought about by his not becoming the big deal in chemistry that he was slated to become along with his best friend.  He screwed that up and ended up being a high school chem teacher.  He also ended up with sky high expenses since he has a son with cerebral palsy and his wife is pregnant again.  In Arthur Miller's ALL MY SONS, the lead character, a father and plane manufacturer during WWII, manufactures faulty planes for WWII pilots.  They fly to their deaths in them.  He lets these flawed planes go because he too wants to be a big deal and cannot handle being a failure.  So he is willing to kill these boys to preserve his own ego.  Likewise, Walt is willing to kill a whole generation of young people by making and selling crystal meth so he can salve his own ego, his own rage at how he did not end up becoming who he should have been.  There are supporting characters too.  His young sometimes partner Jesse is one of these doomed young people, a drug taker who can't get out of his own way.  Even better is his brother-in-law, a DEA agent who is clueless as to Walt's being a drug dealer but supports him in every way in his battle against cancer.  It is difficult to watch an ongoing tragedy unfold weekly but Bryan Cranston is doing the acting job of a lifetime with this character and he has won two consecutive emmy awards for doing so.  It is unbelievable that this is a tv show.  Only now, where there is so much choice in tv, would this be possible.

3781103,5,B001RTSPVY,"Breaking Bad is in my opinion the best serial scripted show on TV. I've certainly enjoyed some episodes more then others, but I've yet to see a bad episode.
Season 2 picks up right where season one left off, and carries the show and its characters further down  the inevitable dark path they began in season one.
In season one, Walt was a more likable character. He's a smart unassuming middle age family Man, who's grown tired of life screwing him over, and then gets a death sentence thrown in his lap. It was easier to understand and sympathize with his motivations, mainly wanting to be able to leave his family a nest egg once he is gone. Walt was a good man, being put in horrible situations, with no good answers.
In season two, with twice the episodes, Walt and Jesse begin making some monetary progress, but also begin facing the consequences of the their bad actions and decisions. Murphy's law continues throughout the second season, and Walt begins to lose his innocence. Crazy Eight had warned him in season one to get out before it was too late. Walt's motivations are less pure, as pride, arrogance, greed and boredom, start to become his reasons for staying in the business. In the second to last episode of the season, Walt commits IMO his coldest act yet, with his passive and selfish indifference to Jane's death.
Season 2 is well written and well acted, with numerous plot points that span the episodes.
Despite the dark themes, realism and humor remain strong points of the show.
My only criticism would be the plane crash scene, while well executed and certainly plausible, it just seemed a bit over the top to me, and out of line with a show so well grounded in its realism.
Also, I'm a little disappointed that some great characters, are being dispatched so quickly. Crazy eight, Tuco and especially Jane, could have brought more to the show. In fact, I thought the Jesse/Jane combo was a good idea, and should have been played out much longer.
Some interesting trivia for those who don't know, is that Jesse was originally supposed to die at the end of season one, but the writers strike, shortened the season and it never happened. Also, Hank and his partner were supposed to have something very bad happen to them at the end of season one as well, but again the strike intervened. Also in season two, in the scene with Jane's death, Jane was originally supposed to start choking right after Walt left, instead it was changed to allow Walt to witness it.
I cannot comment on the DVD's, packing or extra's since they are not actually, released yet, but honestly who reads the reviews and decides to buy an entire season of something based on the extras and packaging?",1245369600,3,2692,4.631799163179917
