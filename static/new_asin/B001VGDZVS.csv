8346382,5,B001VGDZVS,"This is a great release, while it is now dated, with 4 direct to video sequels and a recent 4th theatrical film on DVD, this documentary is now not complete. However, it still chronicles the original trilogy nicely. Released as a bonus DVD with the Unrated Version of ""American Wedding""(with T-Shirt included)and later on its own it is still worth having in your collection.",1365724800,,374,4.859375
