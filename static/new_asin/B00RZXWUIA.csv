6937561,5,B00RZXWUIA,"Our favorite review - from Starburst:

Taking inspiration from Agatha Christies mystery masterpiece And Then There Were None, Ten sees a disparate group of women stranded in a creepy old house on a remote island, stuck in each others company as they wait out a storm. As a killer stalks the shadows of the old building and one by one they are picked off, it soon becomes apparent that none of them are who they first appeared to be.
On the surface, Ten appears to be merely another example of the kind of single-concept slasher flick that should have died out in the 90s, notable only for its entirely female cast. However, its premise is deviously subversive and the film ultimately reveals itself to be a great deal more than the sum of its parts.

The characters and their appearances are all deliberate female archetypes; none of them are ever referred to by name, and each is credited by her defined role, such as the Actress, the Doctor, the Folk Singer or the Historian. The film uses the stereotypical characteristics and appearances to make a statement about the perception of women in film: female characters are often granted only a single defining attribute, as if this one aspect of their personality can completely define them as a person, and is usually one that indicates how they are perceived by men.

The Renegade is a butch, spike-haired, tattooed nonconformist; the Real Estate Investor is a bitchy, ambitious, money-obsessed narcissist; the Medium is a stoner-voiced spiritualist hippie; and the Religious Fanatic is a sanctimonious, judgemental prude. In their individual way, each offers up an observation on the labels that women are forced to assign themselves in order to be accepted as rounded human beings, while their purposefully generic interpretations ultimately becomes significant to the plot.

As well as an incisive piece of social commentary, Ten is also a highly entertaining horror film with a distinct aesthetic. The story is set in the 70s, and with the saturated colour and high contrast of a giallo it even looks like it was actually filmed then; the confines of a creepy old house is a perfect (and cheap!) setting for the pig-masked butcher killer to appear and disappear at will; and some trippy sound editing and visual effects add to unreality of the scenario, as do a few touches of black humour such as one character dying while quoting Mercutios death soliloquy from Romeo and Juliet.

Instead of appearing cluttered, the large ensemble cast works in the films favour. In early scenes the crowd of them is large enough that you can miss one of them inexplicably vanishing from one shot to the next, only realising your oversight when she suddenly appears elsewhere, while the early disorientation from attempting to assimilate so many characters means we are never ahead of them in knowing whats going on.

The advantage of the film being from a female perspective means that some otherwise exploitative aspects, such as the Model stripping naked before deriding everyone else for the facades they hide behind or the Coed nosebleeding into her immense cleavage, appear more matter of fact than cheaply gratuitous, thus avoiding distracting from the films themes. The ultimate revelation behind the events is as incredibly simple as it is joyfully ridiculous, and perfectly fits both the slasher plot and the observations on womens defined societal roles. Ten might be fun and gory, but it also manages to think a little along the way.",1429660800,9,3486,4.970840480274442
6937562,4,B00RZXWUIA,"This was a very strange and convoluted mystery / horror.

Through the film my mind was drawn to Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None.""

Because the original work was an extremely racist story, and then the film was adapted to include whites who had committed heinous crimes. ""Ten"" seems to be a tongue in cheek rendition of a similar plot.

I watch a lot of ""B"" movies, and what is usually lacking is an intelligent design; with ""Ten"" a dark genius shines through.

It has been several days since I watched this, and different portions come to my mind, and cause me to think about it. An all female cast; I think it is very smart.

The reason for four stars instead of five is the bloody and vicious violence which was in line with the movie, but not my tastes. It did add to the theme and plot.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ten/dp/B00WG1IHWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ten</a>",1448323200,,924,5.0130718954248366

6937566,1,B00RZXWUIA,well this was just a beginners project? The script dialog was inconsistent with the setting and characters. That actors made strange and irrelevant choices. The director made even stranger choices. Not sure why they shot the calmer moments at 60fps if this is supposed to have 1970s vibe to it.

Perspective is also involved and mood so you will get some people who like a movie and others who hate it. But how this movie has any fans who weren't involved with the making of Ten is over my head. Just to slow, convoluted and boring. Movie gods save me from all this garbage I'm watching in 2015. This is just another bad movie to forget about immediately.

The slow pacing, sterile sets and exaggerated line delivery make the whole thing come off as a high school play.

It's pretty much a bunch of girls doing what a bunch of girls would do if they were stuck in a single location with one another: be catty.

They just stand around, talking like Shakespeare as they belittle one another and complain. And then, randomly, one will die in a really boring/abrupt/off-screen way.

The plot tries to be ambitious toward the end, but the film is so misguided with tone, dialogue, editing and structure that it ultimately doesn't matter at all.",1442016000,8,622,4.785046728971962

6937591,1,B00RZXWUIA,"If I could give this negative numbers I would. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And they were trying to make fun of the very movie they made. That said, they should have just given the camera to a passerby with no explanation and let them film the movie. It would have been better. It couldn't have been worse. Truly, it couldn't. Anyone who thinks this movie has any merit needs to have their lobotomy reversed, or just realize what good film making is all about. Try 'Let The Right One In'.

I feel vindicated! I am not the only person who thought this movie was a piece of s*it on a cracker and presented as filet mignon. F'ck the folks who say they loved it. They worked on it, they were the monkeys making this crap. It was beyond abysmal. Ed Wood looks good beside this, which hurts to say because there is at least cheese factor involved with his movies.
Bottom line: If someone had strapped a camera to a monkeys head, had that same monkey bang out a script, and direct all of the horrible actors in this film. it would have been better. Maybe they got a retarded monkey to do it instead.

6937592,2,B00RZXWUIA,It was alright-tried not to think about it too much.,1431820800,3,52,4.3
6937593,2,B00RZXWUIA,"""Ten"" has lofty ambitions. It noticeably wants to be a 1970's style grindhouse art film, a social commentary on mankind (with the symbol of a pig constantly deriving from the message in the Dario Argento-lite images and laughably delivered dialogue) and an enigmatic mystery but attempts to juggle so many things at once it rarely succeeds at satisfying any of its goals (let alone being a worthwhile film experience).

  The problem is ""Ten"" still feels too familiar despite its optimism to be something more. We meet your usual unlikable archetypes, all plot serving pawns, as it tells the tale of a murder that happened on Spektar Island in 1972 by a group of individuals in pig masks. Years later ten people are summoned back to the site where the deaths start anew. It all sounds like the plot of far too many horror films before it and it offers no surprises. The movie hardly recovers from how mundane and textbook the plot is herein.

  Perhaps something as 'trivial' as general narrative was somehow misplaced in the effort the creative team was attempting to make this standout. This is proof that if you wish to do something new cinematically the story should still get the most consideration.

  In the early stretches the performances from all ten of the females which compose the cast is so atrocious it is as if they don't need what to make of the script themselves so they play it in a half-serious, half-comedic manner. I believe this might have been intentional to better bridge the many tones, all of them delivered so flatly and with such little interest one can't help but wonder why they even bother with the extra effort, in hopes of creating a uniquely campy, off the rails atmosphere to the proceedings. If it is ""Ten"" doesn't work in that department either.

  It isn't ever intense, frightening or bizarrely atmospheric enough to work in the aforementioned manner. At 82 minutes it feels as if it is an intriguing short that has been stretched an hour or more past what it should be ( a testament to how bloated and lagging the pace is) and the movie only really seems like it is finding its footing during the intellectual discourse where the symbol of the pig takes on its many meanings and when they unexpectedly show us the topic of the conversation (reminiscent of what David Lynch did with the deformed baby in ""Eraserhead""). These are nice touches but it is a small breath of air in a film drowning in its own pretentious shortcomings.

  The cinematography, color palette, story, writing and directing also hint at this hopeful yearning for ""Ten"" to be a spectacular intellectual terrorfest. You can see the filmmakers aspiring to reach towards this cinematic vision that the people involved simply do not have the talent, budget or creativity to achieve. Regardless there is a novelty to this effort, even if it isn't successful that would've been much better if it weren't so full of itself.",1431043200,14,2928,4.77029702970297

I agree with the reviewer who stated this is like a high school play - it really is that camp. It's clear the people who made this film had a blast and feel a lot of pride about it (hence their reviews) but others shouldn't be subjected to it.

A trippy, artistic parody of a genre film, this movie is much more than you see on the surface. Not meant to be taken literally, it's sort of a masked message. If you pay close attention it will really have you thinking.

I would compare this 70s style film to movies like Grindhouse or Machete...or even The Rocky Horror Picture Show, only much more entertaining. So if you're into that sort of madness, this movie is a great find.

6937603,4,B00RZXWUIA,"Ten is a unique and twisted experience of a social commentary style horror. A weird journey into a low budget insanity that sends the viewer, into an acid trip.

This is best described as an art-house horror. An exploration of twists and turns. This can be described as a Fever dream of a darkened trip, with a spiral layered plot of twists and images, that come across as dreamlike.

A film that could quickly become a cult classic. This has all the trademarks of a 70's film. I see a midnight movie. A throwback to 70s style Drive-in flare. This is a priceless example of how to accomplish a weird, different and truly original film. This is equal parts old-school horror, with equal parts cult style, art-house film.

Directed by Sophia Cacciola and Michael J. Epstein. Also co-written by Michael J. Epstein and Sophia Cacciola. Others who wrote the story are Jade Sylvan who also stars in it as the character of The Renegade. Sarah Wait Zaranek also writes part of the film. Simply put everyone had apart in making this film. The film comes together with a Drive-In style, double-bill feature, all one needs is a fat man dressed in a ghoul suit to introduce the feature film.

8696501,1,B00RZXWUIA,"WARNING: SPOILERS - Simply horrid piece of micro-budgeted crap that tries to be sly, but ends up being much too talkative and boring. It is also full of anachronisms. Spektor Island, MA - December 1971: A young woman (Kerri Lynch) is exploring a seemingly abandoned cliff-side mansion with a flashlight (but we learn immediately that the mansion has at least one other person in it and he/she doesn't look friendly). The mansion has a pig motif from a cuckoo clock that has a tiny pig spring out instead of the bird to a pig's head hanging on the wall that pulls out a chunk of the woman's hair. She is then confronted by someone wearing a painted clear mask and carrying a meat cleaver (the way the killer is dressed makes him/her look like an ice cream man, but the killer is listed as ""The Butcher"" during the end credits). The woman runs outside with the killer close behind. In a scene that makes no sense, the woman is suddenly wearing a pig mask, which the killer pulls off and knocks her off a cliff to the ocean below. Spektor Island, MA - December 1972: The woman who fell off the cliff survived and is now back at the mansion, this time with nine other women, all who received a small porcelain pig and instructions to come to the mansion (I'm not going to give the women any proper names because the film doesn't bother to give them any). They are all there under false pretenses with fake professions. The woman listed as the ""Renegade"" (Jade Sylvan) has a nose ring and is full of tattoos (Was that even a ""thing"" in 1972?) and the rest are there are part of an invitation for a business proposition that doesn't exist. After meeting and listening to these ten women, we can't wait until they are killed, especially the woman playing the ""Religious Fanatic"" nun (Molly Carlisle), who chastises another woman for eating a sandwich with meat in it. The actress dreams that ""the ghost of Spektor Island"" (make up your mind; is it the Butcher or the Ghost?) is in her bedroom and when she wakes up, she finds a porcelain pig's head on the other side of the bed (you better laugh now, because the rest of the film is insufferable). In one of the film's most nauseating (or creative; depends on your point of view) moments, we watch the camera spins around the room of a party attended by the women and every 360 turn the clock changes by two hours (7:00 PM; 9:00 PM; 11:00 PM; 1:00 AM). The camera stops spinning at 3:00 AM and someone slips a mickey into the ""model's"" (Leah Principe) drink. While the ""folk singer"" (Sophia Cacciola) plays a tune about pigs, the model strips completely naked (full-frontal; the only instance of nudity on the film) and enters the party, picking apart everyone's fake occupations (besides the ones already mentioned, there's a doctor [Susannah Plaster]; a historian [Rachael Leah Blumenthal]; a real estate developer [Molly Devon]; a coed [Porcelain Dalya]; and a medium [according to the credits, ""UnAmerika's Sweetheart"" Karin Webb]) and then walks upstairs, where we find out she was working in conjunction with the killer and he/she gives her a hand-painted clear plastic pig mask, but everyone finds her dead in the bathtub wearing the mask when the ceiling below the bathroom begins to leak (never trust a psychopathic killer, but one of brain-dead women tries to revive her by breathing into the mask's pig snout!). A hologram of a man (in 1972?) appears in the library and tells all the survivors that they are there because each of them is hiding some kind of deadly secret. This film is basically an unfunny feminist version of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" and when the masked killer shows up, the actress snaps the killer's neck, only to discover that it's the real estate agent, another one of the real killer's helpers. It's not worth it for me to describe any more of the film (you will thank me for that), because the kills are poorly done and, let's face it, the movie stinks. It's just a bunch of awkward 70's dialogue (some of which I never heard in the 70's) with an occasional bloodless kill (there's only one really bloody kill towards the end of the film). The set-up is straight out of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1966 - 1973), as all the women are actually agents for the U.S. government and given false identities to catch ""Ten"", a foreign agent who has some important microfilm in one of the ceramic pigs (They are all given reel-to-reel tapes that self-destruct after ten seconds. The makers of M:I should sue, especially after the small stinger after the end credits.). ""Ten"" turns out to be the tattooed renegade, but she may not be the real enemy. The real enemy may be our own government. Are we really the enemy?  Directed, produced and written by actress Sophia Cacciola and Michael J. Epstein (who wisely chooses to stay behind the camera doing at least a half-dozen different jobs, including Editor and Special Effects Supervisor) and also co-written by actress Jade Sylvan and Sarah Wait Zaranek, this film is like spending a weekend watching your Aunt Gertrude's home videos (yet it won awards at film festivals, which is why I don't go to film festivals, especially since I never heard of half of them). I was actually getting sleepy while watching and nearly dozed off a few times, something I hardly ever do (And if I do, I watch the film completely over but, thankfully, I managed to keep my eyes open for this one. Another viewing would have been worse than being waterboarded). You know the film is in trouble when the best part of the movie are the animated opening credits, but even they are deceiving (it shows women being sliced in half both horizontally and vertically; something we never see in the film proper). The dialogue in this film makes every person seem like a Fulbright intellectual and really takes away most of the film's suspense, especially when coming from these women's mouths. And would someone please explain to me why ""The Butcher"" would stay in a mansion where he/she supposedly killed a woman a year earlier? The person may be a sociopath, but the character is given zero back-story, so we really don't care what happens except that he/she kills this untalented cast. I still don't get the pig symbolism except when one of the women says that pigs are the most intelligent animals besides humans. But what does that have to do with the price of tea in China? Please, I beg of you, don't watch this film unless you are suffering from insomnia. This will put you right to sleep. For a film with no men in it (except for voices; Troma president Lloyd Kaufman is one of those voices), one expects more than this piece of garbage. Filmed in Barrington, Rhode Island and Somerville, Massachusetts. A Brink Vision DVD Release. Not Rated, but only because it was never submitted to the MPAA. If it were, it would get an R-Rating based solely on the nude scene.",1450224000,,6868,4.657331136738056
8696502,1,B00RZXWUIA,Can't think of too much else to say. Acting was probably the worst that I have seen at an budget. This is a Limited Edition - Thank God. This really has to be some kind of joke. It is jaw-dropping awful.,1448841600,2,203,3.975609756097561
