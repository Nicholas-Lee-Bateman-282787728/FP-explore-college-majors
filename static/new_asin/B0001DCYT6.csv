1990586,3,B0001DCYT6,The movie does not play in my state. So i had to trash it. I have seen the movie when I was a kid. And I loved it. Just too bad the movie was not able to be viewed on my device. Other wise I would have kept the movie. The seller was nice enough to resolve the issue with me. No questions asked. So that is why i rate this a 3 star,1330300800,,330,3.472972972972973

1990590,4,B0001DCYT6,The Book Of Love is a great take you back type of movie exploring teen angst in a really funny way covering everything from the bully to the girl of your dreams to ther girl you probably should of been with in the first place starring Micheal McKeon (Leverne and Shirley Spinal Tap X-Files and Smallville)Its a great comedy suitable for all ages Im sure theres alittle part of all of us somewhere in this movie I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh and take a semi trip down memory lane all at the same time,1129507200,,528,4.29
1990591,5,B0001DCYT6,"Hard to believe that the guy in this DVD who plays Schank is currently a candidate for US Senator of Hawaii, but it's true.
This move is full of people who over the years have terrific stories about who they've become since then. Great movie, great director. I heard Brian Evans speaking very well of Robert Shaye on CNN when he was asked about his role in this movie during a political interview with Senator Inouye.
I forgot ""Lenny"" was in this movie, but he's cool in this.",1083283200,,476,4.420454545454546
1990592,5,B0001DCYT6,The first time you see this movie it's possible you'll lose control of your bowels.  I seriously laughed till I stopped.  It's definitly a cheesy movie but I found it incredibly humorous.  It's cool because it's not a  popular movie.  I know tons of people who don't like to have a good time  and those people won't appreciate the humor.  Teenage guys and diapered  senior citizens will definitly like this one.  It's well worth the money!,927590400,8,439,4.671052631578948

1990670,5,B0001DCYT6,"The last time I watched this movie was on VHS nearly 20 years ago. over the years I'd check for DVD distribution, but could never find an availability or a reasonable price i.e., $50 for used! Out of the blue, I browsed one day and to my shock was available and modestly priced. Movie night with my wife was memorable as we laughed hysterically watching the teen experiences of Jack Twiller. Book of Love will always be my favorite, coming-of-age teen comedies, way before the American Pie series killed the genre.",1503878400,,514,4.65934065934066

1990681,4,B0001DCYT6,"""Book of Love"" is a nice coming of age teenage comedy set in the 1950's.  It is funny and pretty believable.  All the actors play decent parts and the plot moves along nicely.  What boy hasn't had a crush on a hot girl whose boyfriend just happened to be a 250 LB linebacker with a cool car.  The movie reminded me of ""Revenge of the Nerds"", ""American Pie"", ""One Crazy Summer"" if you enjoyed those films you'll probably like this one as well.  The movie has a simple innocence to it and does not take itself very seriously which is why it is so funny.  The film does have the normal clichs of a house party when the parents are out of town.  A group of outsider friends who have their own clique who are not very popular.  The scout camp scene at ranger school is hilarious.

The part where his brother asks the stripper for her autograph at the carnival sideshow is endearing.  I really liked how the director opened the film in the future then had the lead character open a year book and go back in time. It was refreshing to see how successful Jack became as a writer at the end of the film going back to meet the girl he seemed meant to be with.  Also I liked how Jack was crazy over Lily but the right girl for him was actually Angelo's sister who pushes her bully brother around which I thought was pretty authentic.

There is a lot to like about this movie all the way around. The film came out in 1990 and I don't remember it at all.  I did not actually see the film until 10 years later.  The film has an anytime appeal to it.  I thought it was a carefree feel good movie.  The actors all look a little bit older than your common teenager but it does not take away from the film. Finally I liked how they finished the film with Jack explaining how he eventually hooked up with Lily and that they did not live happily ever after.  As he drives up to his old Prom Dates house.",1433808000,,1883,4.143250688705234
1990682,5,B0001DCYT6,"This movie is hilarious, if a bit crude at times. I've loved it since high school. Worth the money. It's a story about a group of friends in high school during the 1950's, the girls they're trying to get, the bullies they're trying to avoid and the good times they share together. GREAT music also.",1433116800,,298,4.4363636363636365

1990739,3,B0001DCYT6,"Boasting a classic rock 'n roll soundtrack and an irresistible young cast ""Book of Love"" is a comic chapter in the life of hormone-stricken teen Jack Twiller(Christopher Young).

Whether throwing wild parties imitating James Dean or streaking through the neighborhood Jack will do whatever it takes to win the elusive girl of his dreams,Lily(Josie Bissett), but in his obsession for the prom queen he overlooks the one girl who really appreciates his unique charm. First love first kiss first car... It's all part of the ""Book of Love"".",1390780800,,536,5.090909090909091
1990740,5,B0001DCYT6,"Classic love movie that is fun for both girls and GUYS!! Yes, that is right GUYS TOO! Truly a funny film that was well put together. Coming to terms with falling in love and life in general from a guys point of view.",1386806400,,216,4.046511627906977
1990741,5,B0001DCYT6,"I have right at 4,000 movies in my collection, and this is probably my favorite teen angst comedy of all time. The serious story of a young boy moving to a new neighborhood and falling in love is marked by some of the funniest moments I can remember, plus it features a beautiful young Josie Bissett. It sort of reminds me of ""A Christmas Story"" set in summer with somewhat older characters. In fact, the little brother, Peanut, is quite reminiscent of Alfie in that Christmas classic. Now, that said, I have owned three US versions of this DVD and all three quit playing about two-thirds of the way through. I actually digitized my VHS copy and, together with the parts of the US DVD that did work, put together a complette version that was at least twio-thirds digitally remastered, and my VHS transfer wasn't too bad. Most recently, I bought the European PAL version of the movie and tranfered it to NTSC and, after quite a lot of effort, the whole things works. By the way, I only paid about $5 for a new DVD copy with shipping included all the way from England, and have to say that greed is a good part of the reason that people just aren't buying these old classic movies. In my opinion, there are just too many movies out there to pay $20 for any one. Realistically, these old classics, no matter how good they may be, are only worth about $10 at best. Anyway, my trip to owning a complete digitally remastered copy of this thing  was a long way to go, but I'm a little OC. To sum it up, this is the best teen comedy ever, but unless you're a die-hard like me, you may never see the whole thing on DVD in the US, and taking a chance on a copy of a disc that is known to have problems in its recording doesn't seem worth $20. I hope this helps.

Update: I just noticed that Mr. Greed is growing greener here again--with vendors asking $800 and more for this title. I tried to warn buyers last year to avoid paying $500 for a single DVD  of the classic B-movie ""Mosquito."" Just as I suspected, it was remastered and re-released this year for under $20--it's worth a watch. As for ""Book Of Love,"" be patient and this one will come around again, too. Best of all, you can have the fun of watching as you, just by keeping your eight bills in your own pocket, help Mr. Greed to turn blue and die.",1385510400,2,2298,4.2781609195402295
