this anime stile saturday morning toon

was aim for teenagers

about high school, /dating /and teen broblems

but in outer space.

the animation at it's best for TV animation.

as the characters are always moving

un like most low buget TV animation

where only mouth and one hand moves.

it was one of the made  for USA

and animated from japan toons.

in the 80's  good cartoons

did not get very popular

or long life span on TV.

unless it has a big toy deal involve.:(

this show would have bin a bigger

hit if it was aired in the afternoon,

it was ahead of it's times

 very good cartoon for teens

and all ages.

if you grown up with this show

you'll enjoy the memories.",1146700800,2,702,4.223076923076923
2542496,5,B000EWBNX2,"Awwwww yeah.....This show rocked.  Yes, I was in high school when this came out in the 80's and watched it religiously.  I like wacked-out sci fi cartoons.  I'm excited it's coming to DVD.  I paid $30.00 for a used videotape copy from Canada a couple years ago, so this is gold.  Hey, this is off the subject, but for 80's Voltron fans--heads up--the original series is coming to DVD in September 2006!  Just thought fans would like to know.....(more gold)",1143676800,8,456,4.6375
2542497,5,B000EWBNX2,"July will be a hot month for me!! I will be eagerly awaiting both volumes of Galaxy High! I got a big kick out of this series back in the 80's along with ""The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse"". I was already looking for that classic anime feeling after the loss of ""Mighty Orbots""(I hope someone has this early American-Japanese anime ready for DVD too).  Now if they can also get ""Visionaries"", onto DVD life will be truly sweet.",1143331200,,428,4.417721518987341
2542498,5,B000EWBNX2,"I never thought this cartoon would ever be released!  This short-lived but fondly remembered cartoon stars Doyle and Aimee, two students from Earth who transfer to Galaxy High School.  There are all sorts of aliens and creatures at GHS.  Aimee becomes more socially excepted while Doyle becomes unpopular.  Their roles were switched on Earth.  The popular theme song and music score of the show were performed by Don Felder, former member of the Eagles.  The show itself was created by director Chris Columbus.  John K, of Ren and Stimpy was one of the character designers.  Howard Morris was the voice director and played Professor Icenstein and Luigi La Bounci.  TMS Entertainment/Toyko Movie Shinsha produced the show and animated it.  The show only had 13 episodes and aired one season, later returning the next spring with reruns.  It was reaired again on the SciFi Channel in the mid 1990s.  Now in time for the 20th anniversary of the show, it finally makes it to DVD!  Hopefully MediaBlasters will provide extras of some sort!

2542499,5,B000EWBNX2,THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS OF ALL TIME!!IT'S SO ORIGINAL AND CUTE!!! LOVE IT!!!!,1211500800,,95,4.647058823529412
2542500,5,B000EWBNX2,"During the 80s, when the animated scene had been glutted with nothing but cartoons based either on video games, films, television shows, or merchandising products, there was one gem which stood out on Saturday Mornings:  Galaxy High School.

Chris Columbus developed the concept which was simple enough:  two exchange students from Earth are transferred to the first intergalactic educational institution at the end of the Universe (never really established where exactly GHS was, but that wasn't the point).

The twist here was, on Earth, Doyle Cleverlobe was your typical high-school jock.  Always admired for his athletic prowress, but never once cracking a book (guess this was before 'no-pass, no-play').  Whereas  Amee was your studious geek, always striving for good grades, not really popular.

However, when they end up enrolling at Galaxy High, apparently Amee becomes Ms. Popular, not only for her brillant mind, but the fact she's a female. (Apparently the males outnumber the females at GHS, so seeing another girl is rather fascinating, and one from Earth at that!)  Doyle regrettably has to get a part-time job to earn his tuition, and isn't exactly treated the way he was on Earth.

Way before 'My Gym Partner's a Monkey' dared debuting, there was 'Galaxy High School.'  The interesting thing about this show, while the premise was set thousand of light years across space, the characters faced problems normal (?!) teens had in high school.

You had Beef Bonk, a roosteresque alien who always picks on Doyle, exclaiming ""Earth Stinks!"" As well as his cronies, a living egg creature and a slime lifeform.  You had the rich kid, the socalite, the gossip and the 'Melody' type, they were just aliens.

What made the show really work was it blended in the right humour, and provided lessons without being over preachy, and it was just fun to watch.  In Vol. 1, we learn how Amee and Doyle get admitted to GHS, and how they've coped with their situations at the school.

GHS is one of the rare animations I recommend picking up and watching, because it is one of the gems you hardly see in animation today.  I was fortunate enough to find the first volume here at Amazon, since you can hardly find the series anywhere else.  I managed to get Vol. 2 by accident when I purchased a grab bag at a local electronics store.

Like I said, Galaxy High School is genuinely a series worth purchasing, I hope if they do plan a film for it, they keep it true to the series and hopefully they'll revive it.",1191888000,2,2506,4.799533799533799
2542501,4,B000EWBNX2,"This show was one of very few that my older sister and I could watch on Saturday mornings together.  We usually fought over our single tv (in the 80s) and rarely could agree on anything.  But Galaxy High was enjoyed by both of us.  It's quirky silliness and aliens-can-do-anything storylines were great.  Some episodes have the ""I learned something today"" bit, others are just funny.

The show only had 13 episodes, so it's no wonder they broke the single season into 2 separate dvds.",1186617600,,484,4.714285714285714
2542502,5,B000EWBNX2,"I vaguely remember watching this show when I was younger but I did see it, and remembered enough to want to buy it for my 3 year old son. I can't tell you how much 80s nostalgia is mixed into this show. My son loves it and sings the theme song where ever he goes.

Word of caution though: I don't know what company is releasing the show but their introduction just before the cartoon menu begins is a little inappropriate for younger ears. Bleeped vulgarity. Foward directly to the menue.",1172534400,,488,4.362637362637362
2542503,4,B000EWBNX2,"Developed by ""Harry Potter"" producer and director Chris Columbus, ""Galaxy High"" followed the intergalactic adventures of Earth exchange students Doyle Cleverlobe and Aimee Brightower and their interactions with a student body culled from a variety of alien worlds and cultures. Featuring stunning early TMS Entertainment animation; an infectious music score by former Eagle Don Felder (who also performs the memorable theme song); and scripts featuring a great amount of diversity, ranging from character stories to slapstick comedy, Galaxy High (in terms of quality) was far above most Saturday morning offerings. And now thanks to Media Blasters, this classic quality show is finally available on DVD!

Galaxy High School - Volume 1 is a single-disc (175 min.) set featuring Full-Frame (1.33:1) video, and 2.0 English audio. Despite the lack of bonus features and lack of remastering (sadly, it shows), this set does feature decent picture and sound, nice menu design, and appropriate chapter stops [as the eps fade to and from commercial breaks]. Galaxy High School - Volume 1 contains episodes 1-7, meaning you get the entire 13-episode series in two very affordable volumes, so be sure to complete your collection with Galaxy High School - Volume 2.

Episodes:
""Welcome To Galaxy High""
""The Beef Who Would Be King""
""Pizza's Honor""
""Where's Milo""
""Those Eyes, Those Lips""
""Doyle's New Friend""
""Dollars and Sense""

Highly Recommended!",1166659200,,1437,5.40625
2542504,5,B000EWBNX2,"Oh...my...god.  Finally!  I am ordering these right now.  I cannot believe it's been 20 years.  I feel so old!  I haven't seen these since, but they are burned into my memory like an LSD trip.  You know, I always thought it was called Sweet Galaxy High, for some reason.",1158969600,,270,4.408163265306122
2542505,5,B000EWBNX2,"Yes this will be a bit biased because my mother was the casting director for Galaxy High School and my father played the voice of the lovable slime, Earl Eccchhhhh. I remember being about 10 years old and hanging out in the studios for the recording sessions. What is never brought up is that Nancy Cartwright, the future voice of Bart Simpson, played Gilda Gossip on this show before getting her big break. The voice is nearly identical to Bart Simpson's voice.

Anyway, this show had very clever ideas for ""the future"" back in 1986 and while not near the level of ""you get it or you don't"" futurama humor, this cartoon series was short lived but packed a lot into it's 13 episode. Including a man eating pizza.....Can't beat that for $22.",1153353600,8,740,4.56390977443609
2542506,5,B000EWBNX2,"Finally, Galaxy High is on DVD. I used to love watching this cartoon back in the heady days of wacked out 80's Saturday TV. Im from the U.K so this was a real rareity on British television, and most of my friends never got the chance to see it as it was only shown at very early mornings back in the summer of 1987! Blimmey all the memmories are flooding back just thinking about it, goosebumps and everything! How cool!!! This was by far the best and most emotionally involving cartoon of the lot, a must for those of you looking for a nostalgia fix.",1148601600,3,551,4.257142857142857
2542507,5,B000EWBNX2,"For those of you who never seen Galaxy High it's essentially a teen sitcom show much like Saved by the Bell or Square Pegs, only it's a cartoon... in space... with aliens... and a LOT better. Essentially you get the same elements in both like addressing teen issues (peer pressure, classes, etc), providing satire on HS cliques, and even giving a positive message now and then. The differences (aside from the aliens and such) is in the writing and execution.

Being a cartoon gives Galaxy High the flexibility to make what would be a standard cliche writing for other shows into something funny. Dealing with a bully on Boy Meets World is one thing. Dealing with a bully that's a 7 foot pink alien chicken called ""The Beef"" is another. I'll bet even money that they used that name for the sole purpose of plugging the one liner, ""Where's the Beef"" on the show (and old Wendy's commercial cliche from the 80's). Anyway what's I'm trying to say is the episode plots (or lessons) might be standard fare, but the stuff they write and animate around it makes up for it in spades.

This DVD will have the first seven episodes of the series on it, including  Here's the episode list:

1 - Welcome to Galaxy High: The debut (or pilot) episode that sets the entire premise up for you. Two high school earthlings become exchange students in an intergalactic high school. Love the one liners.

2 - Pizza Honor: Doyle (human) has to deliver a pizza to a haunted planet. My favorite lines are from the Beef and Roland (""Killer mushrooms!!"" ""Vampire penguins!!!"")

3 - The Beef who would be King: The Beef rules a fatty planet as ""the High Cholesterol"", but ends up with a surprise of a coronation.

4 - Where's Milo?: Milo (alien buddy) disapears after getting everybody mad at him. I think the title is a play on the Where's Waldo books.

5 - Those Eyes, Those Lips: Booey (airheaded girl alien with a head like a light bulb) is desparate to get Mick Maggers tickets and gets the gang into all sorts of mayhem to find some.

6- Doyle's New Friend: Don't remember this one, but I think Doyle teams up with some person to mess up some school dance.

7 - Dollars and Sense: Aimee (human girl) gets all caught up with a rich alien who puts her in the high life, but money doesn't buy everything.

I have been waiting a long time for this DVD to come up. Some really good episodes are on this and the price is pretty decent for about two and a half hours of content. No extras, but these sorts of shows never have them. Don't expect any digital remastering though. This is one of those shows the studio hasn't given much attention too, but maybe if this disk and volume 2 sell good maybe they will opt for making a better transfer next time around.",1148428800,14,2732,4.444
2542508,5,B000EWBNX2,"I grew up watching this cartoon during the 1980s. I am pleased it is finally getting released on DVD. This is a dream come true.

Aimee and Doyle, two earth students, participate in a most unusual exchange student program. They are transferred to Galaxy High, a high school in outer space.

Sidestepping some important questions (like how Aimee and Doyle breathed in outer space!) the series instead focused on the consequent cross-interaction issues between humans and aliens. Aimee became part of the in-crowd, while Doyle is a 'nerd'--resulting in some important lessons for each.

In ""The Beef Who Would be King"" Doyle shines, rescuing Galaxy High bully Beef Bonk from the planet Cholesterol. Apparently the people on that planet eat their king!

Then ""Dollars and Sense"" Aimee learns that gifts from Reggie Unicycle really aren't worth it if he's not a good person.

Illustrating just how much time and care did go into Saturday morning cartoons during the 1980's, Don Felder (Eagles) did series music. Okay, I didn't know (or care) who Felder was as a little kid, but his credentials attached to this project certainly are impressive now. The series creators simply could have had anybody doing music for the series--- the majority of us hyped up little kids would not have known the difference during original airdates.

This series is a classic example of a great Saturday morning cartoon. Please release more of them ASAP!",1147478400,8,1431,5.0168776371308015

8115153,3,B000EWBNX2,"As a kid, I loved watching this show every Saturday morning while it was airing! But like all things, not all is OK.

The Good:
See every episode in glorious 480i !
You can finally throw away all those old VHS TV recordings you made long long ago!

The Bad:
Video Quality resembles that of a old VHS Tape. It's as bad as the Quality on the Galaxy Rangers DVD.
High Compression of Episodes

I hope that this series is picked up by a studio that cares, who can clean up the video with ""Disney Quality"" cleaning methods, & release it on Blu-Ray 1080p HD. I look forward to that day.

8115154,5,B000EWBNX2,"I don't usually write reviews, but I figured I'd do so for this show.  It's a great show that shouldn't be missed.  I enjoyed watching Doyle grow into someone we could respect.  I've always believed that this show as about breaking some of the stereotypes that defined who we were back in high school.  My hats off to the creators.",1394841600,,331,4.466666666666667
8115155,5,B000EWBNX2,"One of my favorite Saturday morning cartoons growing up, with imaginative characters and settings and fun storylines. Many of the things I liked about Galaxy High are the same things I love today about Futurama.",1345161600,,211,5.057142857142857
8115156,5,B000EWBNX2,"This was a fantastic TV show back when I watched it as a kid, and it's still fantastic today!  I ended up ordering the DVDs after this.  Chris Columbus did great work on this show.  It never fails to make me smile.

The animation is pretty good, though since it was just a Saturday morning cartoon, it's not going to be of the highest quality.  Still, it's more than adequate.  The style and the character designs really stand out.  It absolutely shines in the writing and voice acting.  Some of the episodes still make me laugh.  I'm glad they chose to end it without doing too many seasons, because they may have worn out the jokes if they didn't.  It wouldn't have been as fresh and new.  Part of what makes the characters Aimee and Doyle work is that the fish out of water concept.  After a while, that would start to wear off and we'd just be left with a high school in space.  It completely embodies so much of the 1980's in its style and outlook, too.

This particular episode is a great opening to the show.  It does a good job of introducing the characters and giving you an idea of the flavor of the series.  They will build on this foundation through the rest of the series.",1317513600,,1185,4.294117647058823

8115159,4,B000EWBNX2,"I grew up in the 80s and although I have fond memories of cartoons from back then, frankly I think for the most part they sucked. Seriously, the cartoons of the 90's and 00's have been way better in quality on most levels than the ones I grew up with. I am really huge on nostalgia and how awesome the old 80s toons were to me, but let's face it - when you try to watch them today they simply do not hold up. I personally can't stand to watch some of those cartoons today that I know I used to love and watch over and over and over again as an 80s child.

This one is different. There are a few golden shows that still hold up to me as decent cartoons (one example, the Real Ghostbusters). I bought both volumes 1 and 2 of this for a plane trip home and I watched them both all the way through for the flight. They were fantastic! It wasn't that the show was particularly funny, but it was entertaining. The character designs are amazingly clever. The voice acting is good. The characters are nicely developed for what it is. The animation is a wonderful step up above the usual bad 80s drek (japanese animation, in fact.. TMS for you animation nerds out there). The stories were cute, too!

I think the strong point of this series is the world it creates. You have these very nicely realized characters and a couple of earthlings thrown in for flavor. It's high school in space, the vibe is very happy, trippy, fun, and just plain awesome. You have this great sense of ""being there"", like you would love to see more adventures of these school kids all from different planets. I don't know how else to explain it other than if you like being transported to a different fictional ""universe"" this show does it really well. It's like being really sucked into an otherworldly universe like Ducktales, Talespin, or some good european comics. It's very ""cartoony"", physics doesn't apply, there are silly ideas and machines, etc. That's all the fun of the show. Very imaginative.

It's not the best toon universe or show out there, but it's decent enough to get caught up in for a short time. I wish there was another season. Give it a shot, I think you'll enjoy the world they created.",1250035200,,2179,4.401985111662531
