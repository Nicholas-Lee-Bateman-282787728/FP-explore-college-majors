4338158,2,B004EPYZTE,"The Review:

""Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of.  And unto this, Conan, destined to wear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow.  It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga.  Let me tell you of the days of high adventure.""

So begins the awesome prologue of Conan The Barbarian released in 1982.  The original Conan helped catapult Arnold Schwarzenegger to super stardom.  This summer's reboot stars Jason Mamoa, who plays Khal Drogo in the HBO series, A Game of Thrones.  While Jason Mamoa is perfectly cast as Conan, the Conan reboot is no match for the original film.  Though this reboot of Conan is better than 1984's Conan The Destroyer.

Reboots necessarily invite comparison to the original movie.  Unfortunately for this reboot, the original Conan The Barbarian is a cult classic because it is actually a really good movie.  This may be hard to believe if you have not seen the original 1982 film because of the governator's reputation for making brain dead action movies, but here are a few fun facts about the 1982 film.  The original Conan The Barbarian was directed and co-written by John Milius (writer of Apocalypse Now) with writing help from Oliver Stone.  Arnold played the title role, but the movie wouldn't have been the classic it was without James Earl Jones' portrayal of the villainous Thulsa Doom.  To top it off, the music was composed by Basil Poledouris.  You may not know the name but you know his music -- Robocop, Starship Troopers and Red Dawn to name a few.

Now comes the 2011 Conan reboot, which is in all fairness, a respectable action movie directed by Marcus Nispel, starring the aforementioned Jason Mamoa.  Ron Perlman does a great job playing Conan's father and Leo Howard almost steals the show as the young Conan.  The makers of the Conan reboot wisely opted for an R rating.  There is sufficient bloodletting to do justice to the Conan mythos. Where Conan begins to go off track is with its one dimensional characters and underutilized fantasy elements.  Chief among the weak characters is the villain, Khalar Zym, played by the extremely talented Stephen Lang.  Khalar Zym is a poor shadow of the villainous Thulsa Doom.

Zym is introduced as an all conquering bad ass on the quest for a fabled mask that is supposed to bestow great power upon whoever wears it.  Despite all the buildup of this mystical super weapon, it turns out to have about as much power as a flashlight.  Epic super weapon fail.  Without a strong villain to provide a suitable challenge for Conan, the movie doesn't ever pick up steam.  Most of the elements for a good movie are in place -- great cast, good action scenes and strong production values, but Zym and his cadre of bad guys just don't carry their weight as fantasy villains.  In the pantheon of villains, Zym is a forgettable b-lister.

Hopefully, the writers can remedy the lack of a strong villain in a sequel.  There's a lot of potential for a franchise and Jason Mamoa is the ideal Conan, but this Conan fan is still waiting for the days of high adventure.

4338159,5,B004EPYZTE,"NOW this is what I call ""Great fast paced action""! Because the action is so cool, so fast and so intense! I could say that this movie is pretty much like Shoot' Em Up but set in a fanstasy world and using swords instead of guns.

There is so much action to fix the action-junkies. There is war, swordfights, horse chase, magic, blood, monsters, pretty women, amazing stunts and of course, Conan as a ONE MAN ARMY! What can be anymore cooler than that?
This movie is obviouslly a hyper-masculine fantasy but many people find this kind of movies very entertaining, let's not forget The Expendables, Shoot' Em Up, Commando, Rambo 2 or even Highlander (anime version).

I must admit that I like movies that focus more on the action than the story or concept. That's good enough for people like me, but as a remake of the original Conan (1981) the fans might be a little disappointed because the original Conan has a SUPERB concept made by John Milius and Oliver Stone that doesn't focus so much on the action, this version is so action-packed but the concept is not so interesting for the fans. The story is basically the same as the original but the fans might still not be so satisfied because of the ""weak"" concept and some clichs. BUT AT LEAST, this movie is not so childish and clich as Conan The Destroyer.

I just wanted cool action and I got it! YEAH! \,,/

4338160,3,B004EPYZTE,"I have been waiting years for someone to do Robert E. Howard right.  I'm still waiting. The film has some nice moments and Jason Momoa makes the role his own -- REH would have been happier with him than he ever would be with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Yet, like the Milius adaption it suffers from this bizaare need to give Conan an origin that Howard never bothered with -- beyond references to his being born on a battlefield, fighting at the sack of an Acquilonian outpost when he was fifteen.  Ian Fleming never felt the need to do an origin on James Bond -- in CASINO ROYALE you meet a full-fledged professional agent.  Howard's first Conan story he is King of Acquilonia. In the second he is a thief new to the lands south of his native Cimmeria.  He wrote the saga as if the old adventurer was sitting around a campfire, regaling with his adventures as they came to him. Sean Hood has idea for the 2nd film, a pre-credits sequence using ""The Frost Giant's Daughter"" and after the credits, ""Queen of the Black Coast"".  That would be more like it.  Howard's Conan tales are mostly novellas -- which makes them perfect for adaption as movies.  One can only hope that the overseas box office and home video justify a second film (ala THE PUNISHER).  Will I buy this on blu ray?  Yes.  It is certainly better than CONAN THE DESTROYER, KULL THE CONQUEROR or RED SONJA.  It could have been so much more. Tyler Bates score is servicable but anyone is going to suffer in comparrision to the late Basil Pouldouris.  What do I like?  Well, beyond Momoa, I love Ron Perlman and he does well as always.  The action is wall to wall and Momoa does it incredibly.  Rose MacGuowan is suitably creepy as Marique. Stephen Lang is a good actor but the role somehow seems lacking. The sand golem sequence is terrific.  Yet all in all, this film doesn't quite fit the bill. One can only wonder what a Walter Hill, Oliver Stone or Robert Rodriguez could do with the property.  I am placing my hopes of a good adaption on Andrew Stanton's JOHN CARTER.  Listen, don't get me wrong.  Did I enjoy this film.  I did. I am just disappointed that it wasn't it really could have been.  Let us all cross our collective fingers that a second Conan film gets made and they get it right.",1314576000,3,2256,4.437956204379562
4338161,3,B004EPYZTE,"I love Conan/ Middle Earth type of movies, although for some reason the original Conan lacked appeal to me, perhaps because it looked like Arnold wore a wig the whole time. In this film we get a significant childhood view of Conan as a person who has more heart than brains. After his village is destroyed and his father killed, Conan wanders the earth to find the man and seek revenge.

He comes to a town involved in slave trade, kills the traders and frees the topless women in a cage. Later soldiers show up and Conan deliberately gets himself arrested so he can get inside of the prison camp to get information. Of course armed guards are no match for a chained Conan.

Conan is a barbarian, a Viking type. Another tribe appears to mimic Native Americans with Mohawks and another of the 12 tribes mimics Mongolian. The problem with Conan, the Barbarian is that he speaks as a barbarian with bad lines and a bad delivery. The CG specials effects make this a better film. There is a good supporting cast, however Conan himself was just written poorly. For most people this should just be a rental.

No f-bombs, nudity, one poorly lit sex scene.",1314403200,,1147,4.531400966183575
4338162,3,B004EPYZTE,"Schwazenegger left the ""Conan"" role with some mighty big biceps to fill. Sad to say, Jason Momoa doesn't do the job. This movie had lots of great moments, like that hissing witch with the Electra complex, The Dweller (sashimi with an attitude), and the lovelies at the slave market. The leading lady was pretty good - savable enough for a hero to act heroic around, able to hold her own when given a chance, and charming as a participant in the couples' gymnastics.

But, with flat acting, two-dimensional characters, harem pants (I think) on Conan, and dialog barely worth the name, there wasn't a terrible lot to make this memorable - except maybe the young Conan.

4338163,5,B004EPYZTE,"I had seen a couple of trailers before going to see this movie and I knew that Jason Momoa from Stargate Atlantis was cast as the lead.  I wasn't expecting much.  All I have to say is that it delivered everything that I could hope for in a Conan movie.  This movie isn't getting enough hype.  Jason Momoa does a great job portraying everything that I know about Conan (...I've read about 10 comics and have seen the 80's movies a few times).  In my opinion, the acting, the filming, the directing, the scenery and the story were all superb.  Five stars... what can I say?.. I'm a big fan of the comic-to-movie adaptations (they're my favorites).

You won't want to take your kids to this... it's a Barbarian movie (a considerable amount of brutal Violence, some nudity).  All good stuff :)

4338164,5,B004EPYZTE,"Conan the Barbarian as a film is about as subtle as getting shot in the privates with a paint ball gun. It's near impossible to judge this as a ""good"" film in the traditional sense. I have no doubt that many people are going to hate it, including some, if not many, Robert E. Howard fans. But as a film in the grindhouse tradition, it's a friggin' masterpiece. I grew up on Robert E. Howard, but it's certainly not all that I grew up with. Somewhere along the way, I developed a taste for shocking exploitation cinema as well, and I attribute this love, at least in some part, to my love of Howard. I love The Evil Dead Trilogy, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Stuart Gordon Lovecraft films, The Pinky Violence Collection, and The Sword and the Sorcerer, just to name a few. Having just learned about its existence, I really want to see ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"". ""But why??? Why would you possibly want to see a film like that?"" Well, to quote Randall from Clerks 2, ""Because its f'd up, that's why!"" Having said that, I feel like I've just witnessed one of the greatest exploitation films of all time, and I'll be shocked if this doesn't become something of a cult classic among those of us who ""get it"". As far as ""getting it"" is concerned, either you do or you don't, and if I have to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand, but I would ask the question, ""What is grindhouse cinema if not the cinematic equivalent of pulp fiction?"" ""Well yeah"", some might say, ""Robert E. Howard wrote for the pulps, but his writings transcend the limitations and the bad clichs that exemplify the vast majority of the pulp medium"". And I agree, but when talking about exploitation cinema, so does the Evil Dead Trilogy and Reanimator, and in my opinion, so does this film.  Robert E. Howard's fiction is full of deep philosophical subtext, but we're kidding ourselves if we think that the baser, more exploitation oriented material isn't in there as well. Just ask Margaret Brundage. Going back to my earliest days as a fan, I still remember hiding my Savage Sword of Conan magazines from my parents, because I knew that those Frazetta inspired covers with the perfectly proportioned females, their breasts fully exposed save for silver dollar sized brass pasties, would likely throw my Mom into a tirade. But even the comics did little to prepare me for the real thing, that is, Robert E. Howard's prose. When I first started reading the Lancers, I was shocked at how brutal and graphic it was.

But I digress. About the film: outside of the horror genre, I can't recall a film in recent memory that's so in your face, so completely unabashed and unapologetic, so ""I really don't give a **** what you think"" in forwarding its ideological agenda. And yes, there is an underlying philosophy here, though you might miss it amiss the chaos and mayhem. In terms of sheer audacity, the only recent non-horror film that even remotely comes to mind is ""The Passion of the Christ"". As far the Sword and Sorcery genre of film is concerned, I can't think of a single film to compare it to. Conan the Barbarian is the first of its kind.

""But Rotten Tomatoes gives it a rating of 27%. How can all of these people possibly be wrong?"" Good question! Let me try my best to explain. While waiting for the film to start, I was subjected to what they like to call the ""pre-show entertainment"", and let me tell you, if every sinner is subjected to their own personal Hell after death, then this would be pretty close to mine. I felt like I had to endure wave upon wave of the most insipid crap one could imagine. A painfully unfunny sitcom where a wife seeks to spice up her and her husband's love life by dressing up as a sexy nurse and making him fill out patient information forms. Taylor Lautner, with his adorable little pug nose, trying to pass himself off as an action hero as he mutters ""Not if I find you first!"" in his little girly man voice. This is what passes for entertainment these days? Apparently, yes, or they wouldn't continue making it. ""Oooo! That looks good"". Uh...yeah. I have a strong suspicion that there's a significant overlap between the kind of people who consider this stuff to be quality entertainment and those who post comments such as ""Oh God! Not another remake!"" and ""Looks like Prince of Persia meets Clash of the Titans to me"" on film forums. A long time ago, before this film was made, I referred to them as the ignorant masses, and I think my characterization was spot on. In my own twisted and demented view of the world, these are people virtually devoid of anything that even remotely passes for an imagination, or the capacity for independent thought. ""Roger Ebert gives it a bad review, so that settles it"". That's not a joke, by the way. People are actually saying it. Robert E. Howard had another word for them: civilized, and this is not a film that was made for civilized people.

Ridley Scott's ""The Hour of the Dragon"", which redefined and reinvigorated the Sword and Sorcery genre of film while racking up several Oscar nominations, and for the first time in 80 years put Robert E. Howard's fiction on the best seller list, is a film that I'd love to see. And in some parallel universe I'm sure Howard fans are raving about it. But in this universe, that's not the film we got. I love Gladiator. I love Kingdom of Heaven. I love Braveheart; not to mention Alexander Nevsky and The Seven Samurai. I certainly have no problem with Oscar worthy historical epics, and I know them when I see them. But Ridley Scott is, after all, a civilized filmmaker. Even at his R rated best, there's a line that the conventions of a polite society dictates that he won't cross. Or at least he hasn't crossed it yet. Marcus Nispel completely ignores such boundaries. In fact, he brazenly steps over them, drops his pants, and waves his private parts at those who are appalled at such behavior. In a hypothetical universe, I think a Conan film directed by Peter Jackson would be amazing. But instead of the Peter Jackson who directed Lord of the Rings, how about the Peter Jackson who directed Brain Dead? Or Sam Raimi before he got his hands on Spiderman? In other words, before these filmmakers were corrupted by civilization. I truly believe that this is the Conan film that we got. In the best tradition of Howard, Nispel puts forth the question of barbarism vs. civilization and unequivocally sides with the barbarian, and not so much in terms of the story, but in the methods he uses to tell the story. ""Not so fast"", you say, ""One can explore the inherent struggle between barbarism vs. civilization and challenge the decorum of polite society without all this gratuitous crap. We don't need to see people's noses getting chopped off, people peeing themselves, and women being disrespected to convey that message."" In other words, we don't need to be shaken out of our civilized comfort zone to be shaken out of our civilized comfort zone. I disagree. Just look at some of the more ""respectable"" films that explore the same themes, such as Deliverance or A Clockwork Orange, films which use some of the conventions of grindhouse cinema to get their point across.

This almost palatable contempt for the conventions of polite society and those who adhere to it is best exemplified by Momoa himself. Rarely is the point of view of the protagonist and that of the director in such perfect synch. As for Momoa, he's like a big jungle cat, which is the highest compliment I can think of. In capturing the character that Robert E. Howard put down on paper, he nailed it. He absolutely nailed it. In the hands of a lesser actor, this film could have been an unmitigated disaster, but Momoa IS the film. He's in virtually every scene, which is fortunate, because his performance is a joy to behold. I was quite literally dumbfounded by how spot on it was. This is a character with virtually no regard for the ""rules"" of civilized behavior, a character that would not be slightly abashed about nailing a pirate queen on the deck of her own ship with the entire crew looking on, a character who is willing to do on a whim things that most ""civilized"" people would not even consider, such as deliberately getting himself arrested and subsequently slaughtering the entire police force to get his hands on his intended target. I can only imagine how some feminists will be outraged at his treatment of Tamara, but that's the whole point. She's civilized, and as such, she lives with the illusion that the pillars of civilization guarantee her a basic level of dignity and equality. Conan, on the other hand, has no such illusions. He knows innately that civilization is just an illusion, and that beyond its boundaries no one is guaranteed any level of self autonomy unless they are physically able to enforce it for themselves. So yeah, she gets a gag stuffed in her mouth. She doesn't get to talk just because she thinks she has a ""right"" to. A hard lesson, but a valuable one nonetheless.

""But what about the story?"" Well, it's a pastiche, but I would certainly rate it higher than most Conan pastiches I read, which is something of a miracle, considering the fact that about half of it is written by Donnelly and Oppenheimer (with MAJOR improvements by Sean Hood, god bless him). The opening sequence, in which Morgan Freeman starts reading from the Nemedian chronicles, was so absurdly over the top that my initial gut reaction was bad flashbacks of ""Kull the Conqueror"". It was like riding in the passenger seat down the highway, safely along, when all of the sudden your driver has a spontaneous psychotic meltdown and swings the car off the road. And then, the birth scene; Jesus! I found myself going ""Really? I mean, really???"" It wasn't even the premise of the scene that really got to me. It was how so over the top and melodramatic the film was in depicting it. But then, somehow, miraculously, it didn't manage to land in the ditch. It got better. Much, much better. Or worse, depending on how you look at it. Leo Howard was totally convincing in his brief stint on young Conan, and I absolutely loved the scene with him against the Picts. Khalar and Marique are sufficiently over the top and scenery chewing (as well as creepy...really, REALLY CREEPY). Conan is given a literal rogues gallery of colorful villains, both male and female, to kill; all of them one dimensional, but damn fun to watch nonetheless.

I have to say I loved the look of the film, and I thought the cinematography was impressive, not to mention the natural scenery of Bulgaria. I think it really captured the look of the Hyborian Age as Howard described it. I loved the actions scenes. Absolutely loved them. I think the film totally delivered on the sheer carnage factor. And let's admit it, that's a huge part of Conan's appeal, and this film has a pre-gunpowder body count that rivals ""Lone Wolf and Cub"". Momoa's speed and agility with a sword were nothing short of amazing to watch, and I've never seen sword work on film that looked quite like this, and I've seen plenty of sword films, both eastern and western. ""Unorthodox, but instinctive and natural as that of a timber wolf""; yeah, I think Momoa nailed it. The music? It was just sort of there. It carried the story, but it didn't particularly draw attention to itself. There were no distinctive and hummable leitmotifs that I can recall, which in itself is a disappointment. Tyler Bates has delivered better in the past.

So, to sum things up now, when I read some of the initial reviews, I was worried that I was going to be hugely disappointed, so I tried my best to watch the film with my purist goggles off. But as it turns out, the Howard purist in me is perfectly okay with it as well, and ultimately that's the highest compliment I can think of. I know that there are people who will vehemently disagree with me on every point, and I'm perfectly okay with that. Honest. I'll be sorely disappointed if there are not future installments, but even if not, at least I'll have this film. If I can't get a filmed version of a genuine Howard story, at least I'll have a Conan film that gets the character right. Jason Momoa: YOU ARE THE MAN! I want to take home the unrated Blu-Ray Extended Edition and get gloriously drunk while watching it. Repeatedly. Did I forget to mention that Conan is fun?

And in case anyone hasn't noticed by now, I've made quite a deliberate point of not bringing up the Milius film, nor comparing the two. Suffice it to say, if this were the film I had seen in 82, I think I would have been very happy indeed.",1313884800,16,12588,4.586145648312611
4338165,5,B004EPYZTE,"I actually really liked this movie.  I'm a long time fan of sword and sorcery books and movies and think this movie was one of the best in the genre.  It was a very exciting movie with almost constant action, what more can you want from a Conan the Barbarian movie.  It wasn't directly based on one of Robert E. Howard's stories but I think the Conan in this version was just as true to the Conan character as the Arnold Schwarzenegger version.
  I enjoyed every moment of this movie, this is exactly what a modern Fantasy movie should be. It was very exciting.  This movie was better than Red Sonia and The Beastmaster part 2 put together.  The fighting scenes were excellent and all of the battles scenes were top notch.
  I thought the setting of the movie was excellent, most of the movie was filmed in Bulgaria and made for beautiful and engrossing scenery which is very important in a Fantasy movie.  The castles and villages were also very well done and ominous looking.
  I don't see why critics are being hard on Conan the Barbarian (2011). In the excellent stories Conan hardly talks he just goes around killing people with his sword and saving slave girls, that is exactly what Jason Momoa did in this movie and he was very convincing about it.  If you want an emotional PC chick flick go see ""The Help"" (or rent it) if you are a real man (or a women who likes watching real men) watch Conan the Barbarian (2011)!",1313884800,6,1424,4.430769230769231
4338166,3,B004EPYZTE,"In the dark and ancient Hyborian Age, Conan the Cimmerian, brooding and grim and restless, roamed the lands in towering strides, fighting, wenching, thieving, and occasionally inadvertently saving the world from malevolent sorcerous threats. In the fullness of time, he is destined to bear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow. Except that this film reboot fails to deliver on that moody pulp sensibility of which writer Robert E. Howard was such a master. And, to cut to the chase, yes, the Arnold Schwarzenegger version is superior. That one had more of an epic scope. And, as I remember it, more of a sense of fun.

I saw CONAN THE BARBARIAN at a midnight showing. What initially began as a hopeful and raucous audience, clapping and hooting, gradually became this subdued crowd, disappointment all palpable. No one clapped when the end credits rolled. Certainly, Morgan Freeman's civilized voice-over narration doesn't get your blood pumping quite like Mako was able to do in the 1982 film. And certainly this tired interpretation could've benefited hugely from Basil Poledouris's rousing score. GAME OF THRONES' Jason Momoa makes for a good Conan. He has the physical presence and he's got the baleful hooded stare down pat. You believe him when he's wielding his sword and carving fleshy bits off those what get in his way. You can't fault him for the dialogue (but you can fault the screenplay writers). Casting Jason Momoa means more closely honoring Robert E. Howard's description of his iconic barbarian. Momoa is lithe and catlike quick and glowering. And he's not a lumbering blond Austrian, which is as far from Howard's specs of Conan as you can get.

Born on a battlefield, Conan, even at a young age, demonstrates exceptional fighting prowess. Leo Howard, in  his brief stint as young Conan, proves to be a disquietingly savage child, and there's a bit of stealing Momoa's thunder here, even before Momoa's arrived on screen. I think the best bits in the film happen when Leo Howard is getting his blood up and facing off against adult warriors (and winning!). But young Conan's game efforts aren't enough to thwart the pillaging of his village, the slaughter of his people, the torture and murder of his father. Still, the implacable warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) should not have suffered the boy to live. This is a big bad's typical bungle.

We were never going to be treated to an award-winning script with this movie. But I wonder how less disjointed the plot would've been had it only stuck to one thread? To Conan's seeking revenge on Khalar Zym, maybe? The messiness of the narrative surfaces once Khalar Zym and his creepy witch daughter Marique (goth pin-up model Rose McGowan) are allowed to have their own sub-plot, namely their quest to reconstruct the bone mask of Asheron, an artifact of which broken shards had been scattered across Hyboria but which, when reassembled, can be used in a spell to resurrect the dead. Khalar Zym desperately wants his dead wife brought back to life. His freaky daughter thinks she can just as easily slide into her place. Eew[...]

Another required element to the spell is the pure blood of a descendant of the necromancers of Asheron. And so cue Tamara (Rachel Nichols), straight out of the monastery (yet well-versed with a blade). Tamara starts out as this promisingly capable and self-reliant girl, and so it's bitterly disappointing that she eventually succumbs to damsel-in-distress-itis. Rachel Nichols sure can scream a bunch.

For the lusty, testosterone-ridden teen, CONAN meets its sword and sorcery obligations. Claret flows, viscera erupts. Noses are abused inhumanely. There are some rather gruesome moments, some brutal kills. There are a fair number of topless wenches, and even one random and arbitrary sex scene. The set designs are somewhat reminiscent of Frank Frazetta's paintings (and Frazetta's covers are what got me reading Conan stories in the first place). So that's gravy.

There is non-stop action which may or may not become tedious in your eyes. The best fighty fights occur when kid Conan was doing his thing and then, much later, when the creepy witch daughter blows a kiss, this mystically summoning a unit of sand golems.

I have to mention two more things. First, I appreciate the film's referencing Howard's classic ""The Tower of the Elephant"" story. Second, this Conan's signature quote happens to be ""I live, I love, I slay, and I'm content."" - a philosophy which is nice except that, by Crom, it doesn't quite match the awesomeness and sheer quotability of Schwarzenegger's classic response to ""What is best in life?""",1313884800,5,4638,4.998704663212435
4338167,2,B004EPYZTE,"I just saw this film. Been a HUGE Conan fan since the early 70's, from comic-books to novels to the films.

When Arnold Schwarzenegger was chosen to be the 1st Conan on film,I had my doubts. But after seeing it, despite some awkward dialogue, Arnold embodied at least most of the true heart of the character, helped MAJORLY by a collection of screen writer and director who obviously loved Robert E. Howard's greatest creation.

John Milius just proved to me that modern-day writers, directors, and special effects doth not make a solid Conan film. The new one had great production, and an actor that just proved he has the look and feel of Conan. But the poor actor had to deal with the cards he was given to play one of the most beloved fantasy icons ever written.

This film started out decently enough, but then spiraled ever downward faster than a speeding bullet with a ton of boulders on top of it. What a shame. Why is it that Hollywood can seemingly do comic-book caped crusader type heros great - but can't do Conan or Tarzan justice? For the life of me I can't figure this out. Filmmakers have TONS of choice written material with which to draw from. And yet, for this latest film, 3 or 4 screen writers cannot get it right. All it takes is one to screw it all up. This one took several.

I hope SOMEONE with some true vision can take this poor new Conan actor and give him a much better Conan script and director - and make Conan the Barbarian the RIGHT way! Don't need an origin story. THAT has already been done. Like Batman and Superman. Leave it alone. Just pick up from the origin and get these heros to bigger and better adventures! STICK with the source material.

I guess poor Tarzan, like Conan the barbarian, will be done half-assed until SOMEONE with half a brain can see that they have a wealth of source material from which to do a TRULY spectacular Tarzan or Conan film. Especially Tarzan. No one has made him nearly as good as Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote and imagined him. Not a savage knuckle-dragger who grunts, but a very intelligent being that can walk and kill on BOTH sides of the human evolution tracks.

4338255,3,B004EPYZTE,"While I do love Jason Momoa, this version isn't good. The first thing that ruined it for me was the casting of a sword. Anyone that knows anything about metals knows that this won't make a blade at all. Casting iron is great for pots and skillets, but NOT edged weapons. They can't be ""forged"" at all or tempered or hardened or even hammered.. they'll just shatter. Edged weapon iron and steel has to be made by hammering the hot (but not molten) ore, sparks flying and all.. something that would have been a lot cooler to see than fake molten iron flowing in to a 'mold.' Then molten metal later just burns his dad a bit. Metal, when molten like that, is 3000 degrees F. Any flesh it touched would have been instant charcoal and certainly elicited a LOT more than the reaction it got from daddy in this movie.

Plus, the storyline is completely different. I much prefer the 1982 version. Even that long ago, etc etc it was a lot more enjoyable and believable. I loved how the young Conan grew up under the yoke of slavery in that version and became a hero of slaves rather than one that freed them only to then take advantage of the scantily dressed slave women, along with his companion, that this version portrays.",1521676800,,1217,4.433035714285714

This 4K picture quality is no better than standard 2K blu-ray. Don't waste your money on upgrading from 2K to 4K (like I did). Or when purchasing a new movie, buy the 2K and save. There is no difference.

And don't listen to the other reviews (from the studio shills) that say this picture rez is ""great,"" etc.
Blu-ray.com is useless for your evaluation of 4K quality. No correlation to real world rez.

You have $90m, McGowan, Lang, and Momoa, a fairly decent script, a professional crew, sets, efx artists- the lot, and what do you do? You lay a giant turd. Every single shot (and I mean every. Single. Shot.) in this movie is so poorly staged you will have no clue where anyone is or what they're doing there. Its so godawful that even in widescreen this thing looks pan and scan.

This mightn't have been so bad if the script were equally terrible, but it isnt- so you're forced to watch as Nispels pure unadulterated ineptitude murders every single good idea in turn. Who shoots a chase scene in close ups? A talentless hack named Marcus Nispel, thats who. Who puts together a major battle scene without offering the audience any sense of geography or scale? Why, that would be Marcus Nispel. Who needs an establishing shot? Not Marcus Nispel. Why is Rose McGowen (who should have been inroduced in some epically badass way) introduced like an extra, and shot so awkwardly that she immediately loses all mystic? Because Marcus Nispel thought it was cool. Who is under the misguided impression that wanton use of slow-mo makes everything instantly better? That would be Marcus Nispel.

4338519,3,B004EPYZTE,"The shadow of the 1982 Conan the Barbarian hangs heavy over the 2011 version.  As it must be.  Conan the Destroyer is best forgotten, and the 1982 version of Conan IS Conan for a generation.  Surely far more people have seen it than have read Robert E. Howards original stories.

This movie tries and does get a lot right.  There are nice bits like the reference to Acheron in the opening narrative.  We get to see Conan literally born on the battlefield.  The young Conan here is the sort who according to Howards Conan was already the talk of the campfires at fifteen.  The Picts who attack Conan in the opening are a nice mix of historical Picts and the Comanche who so obviously influenced Howards depiction of the Picts.  Momoa credibly looks not just physically imposing but pantherish and shows a bit more of Conans personality.

But then you have weird stuff like Ron Perleman, caveman.  His death scene is needlessly drawn out.  For a guy who kills four Picts with an egg in his mouth as not quite a man, Conans rough edges have been sanded off.  The villain here is as banal as James Earl Jones Thulsa Doom was compelling.

More to the point, it doesnt have the craft of the 1982 version.  I loved that movie from the first time I saw it as a kid.  But rewatching it now with a more practiced eye, I only appreciate Milius craft more.  The 2011 movie commits the ultimate sin for a Conan story.  Its conventional, and Howards original stories were never conventional.",1501718400,8,1477,4.509433962264151

Example: Conan cuts off a guy's nose on camera, ""Ahh, My Nose!"" you see the nose hit the ground. Basically every line in this is giving exposition rather than character building. The opening sequence made to show the bond between Conan and his father was a pretty clear homage to the 80s Conan. They tried to make it bigger and better, and just came out as cheese.

Visually it was good. Fight choreography mediocre. Pacing was a mess. It's like someone read a text book that said action movies need a fight scene every ten minutes.",1501459200,3,726,4.627906976744186

Sure, probably worth watching but not something you would ever want to see again.  Mild spoilers to illustrate plot holes (only a couple of many, many possible examples): 1.  the ""pure blood"" woman-the last of her kind and the only one who can resurrect evil incarnate whom they have been protecting from the hordes of evil minions is told to go catch up with Conan to give him a map (wink wink-sleep with him).  Then, once they have ""mated"" she walks back ALONE again (now inexplicably through a forest).  Just to recap: pureblood one of a kind wanted by evil army and madman whom they are supposed to protect is sent off TWICE by herself!  What?  Seriously.  So, of course she is caught.  2.  Evil sorceress Marique (Rose McGowan dressed like a cross between Star Wars Padm Amidala and Freddy Krueger has multiple scenes of ridiculousness including having the power to summon pretty cool sand-humanoids to do her bidding but the rest of the movie (because the plot is so poorly written) she does NOT use any magic becausewell then it would make sense.  3. Also with Padm Amidala and Freddy Krueger's love child (aka Marique) after the pure blood is captured she supposedly loses her Freddy Krueger steel finger thing (Conan finds it) but then she isn't missing one and it looks different than the other ones?  None of Conan's ""friends"" are likable and there is zero character development.  Conan's friend Ukafa has to tell the pure blood wench Conan's characteristics because they certainly don't show you.

Also, (spoiler), when Tamara (damsel in distress but she could definitely hold her own), pushed Marique to her death, I saw in one split second the stand-ins for Jason Momoa and Rachel Nichols. I was very impressed with Leo Howard who played young Conan. Though his part was brief, Ron Perlman was great as Conan's father. Stephen Lang was awesome as Khalar Zym, the ruthless warlord. Considering the storyline they had to work with, the entire cast was great. To name just a few: Rose McGowan as Marique, Zym's daughter and a powerful witch. Sad Taghmaoui as Ela-Shan, a thief who pays his debt to Conan by helping him. Nonso Anozie as Artus, a Zamoran pirate and friend of Conan.

That was ridiculous to me.  That was not Howard's Conan.  In the 2011 version, the youthful Conan faces off against the warriors and takes them all down.  No cowering, no hiding.

There are certainly worse films, and this is an acceptable way to kill a couple of hours with a sword and sorcery flick.

4338877,3,B004EPYZTE,"The sixty three people who are devoted fans of the print version of the Conan tales will relish this very expensive, $95 million film.  Robert E. Howard, the author of the original books, was one of the more successful writers in the 30s, 40s and 50s who dwelt in literatures basement, the realm of what came to be called Pulp Fiction.  These guys were paid by the word back then and none of them had any pretense of writing worthwhile literature, literature for the ages.  Lots of action, blood and sex and never mind the inner conflicts that make characters interesting.
 The best thing about this film incarnation of the Conan saga is its dedication to the spirit of the original concept.  At one point Conan says that the purpose of his life is to live, love and slay.  Pithy that.  The next best thing is the courage with which this project is undertaken by the producers and director Marcus Nispel, who did the successful Friday the 13th of 2009 and the 2003 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  They play this straight, as an epic unfolding of the story of an icon in the genre with none of the wink wink isn't this a grand joke that many films of this sort descend to.  This Conan film is as serious as decapitation.
 The prolegomenon of the film, which deals with Conans unusual birth and the traumatic loss of his father (played by Ron Perlman with exactly the correct degree of severity and warmth) I also thought quite well done.  The sets, costumes, armor and weapons are admirable as well.  Things go downhill rapidly from that promising beginning, sad to say.  Jason Momoa has the lead role.  He also plays a barbarian warrior in the current HBO series Game of Thrones.  When Arnold grimaced and grunted through this role many years ago, he had yet to learn the craft of acting (and English) and so may be excused.  Momoa just isn't given a fair chance by the writers.  Nor is anyone else for that matter.  We have dimly perceived archetypes on the screen, not people.  If even good actors are not asked to speak decent lines, we cannot in fairness fault the actors.  Rachel Nichols previous role as Scarlet in GI Joe prepared her to stand out in the noise and bright flashes, as she does here.  Rose McGowan takes advantage of her role as a witch to show her talents, in spite of the writing.  She has the most fun. You might remember her in Planet Terror where she has a machinegun implanted as a peg leg.
 Bad writing, wooden or worse acting, well who cares, right?  Its a Conan the Barbarian movie.  Hard core fans will like its authenticity and truth to the tradition.  The rest of us will give this peek into the Hyborian Age a pass.  This one hour and 52 minute R rated (violence, lots and lots of half naked women, also graphic sex, Conan style) film is only for fans.  The general public will not be interested, or isn't interested.  This expensive, bold, true to its roots failure has brought in a tiny $16 million in ten days.  The producers must be weeping this night in Hollywood.",1470182400,,3008,4.496309963099631

4338902,5,B004EPYZTE,"This Conan movie is more faithful to what Robert E. Howard wrote about than the Conan movies back in the 80s, those movies were Sword and Sorcery movies but they should have never put Conan in the titles.  Robert E. Howard would have been very disappointed in them. If you are going to make a movie about an icon character such as Conan, it should be made like Conan the Barbarian starring Jason Momoa, Conan had an exotic look to him, he had dark hair and was tanned from tropical climates that he traveled to, he did not have blonde hair like Arnold did in those other movies.  Conan also had cat like reflexes, Jason Momoa was cat like in his movements, and he weilded his sword more in the vain of how Robert E. Howard wrote about, that is something you cannot say about Arnold he is not cat like in is movements and is pretty slow wielding sword. Jason Momoa also did a lot of research and read the stories by Robert E. Howard as well as some of the comics too. One other thing, when Conan in the 1982 film when he is tortured by Thulsa Doom, would have never been crying  ""You killed my mother! You killed my father, you killed my people! You took my father's sword"" Conan never showed that type of weakness at all in the books, I have read all the stories that were in print that Robert E. Howard wrote about Conan, Kulll, King of the Picts Bran Mak Morn, Cormac mac Art

 At the time when Mr. Howard wrote about Conan, there were not men the size of Arnold and Conan was never intended to look like that, he had muscles yes but they were never that big, I wish people would take the time to read the original stories instead of basing their opinion on being a fan of an actor.",1467158400,10,1684,4.217391304347826

I real all the Conan stories back in the late 60s/early 70s and loved them.  Thought this version of Conan is far far far better then any previous ones, just more gritty and dirt infested as life back then probably was.  But this movie feels like it's just the introduction to a fine long series where they'd develop the character much better, show his sense of humor, his apathy about money and glory, etc.  I hope that happens.  The CGI was excellent, lots of blood and gore too.  My bro said The Rock's Hercules was even better but I just watched it and still think Conan is better.  Momoa just plays him a little more comfortably (I felt The Rock was just a little too polished to be Hercules, although I really liked his band of merry men and woman).",1466294400,6,974,4.426966292134831

4339128,4,B004EPYZTE,"So the reviews for this are all across the board. Basically I think everyone should take that to mean that you may really love it, you may really hate it, or you may just find it to be decent.

Here are a few things to help you decide.

1. If you absolutely love the Arnie movies and have never read the books, you will likely find this to be so-so. This movie has a Conan that is way more like the one in the books. He's not just some muscled up lug walking around swinging a sword and he's certainly not blond haired and blue eyed, with an Austrian accent. Momoa looks incredibly like the darker complexion character from the books. Though huge, and imposing physically, you can very easily tell that like most modern actors he actually did some training to wield the sword convincingly and also seem skilled at it. The combat in this is far more convincing, whereas Arnie was cast not for his acting, or the realism of his combat scenes, but because he was big ole Arnie. If big ole Arnie is your favorite thing about the old movies or the only real reason you love them, you'll be disappointed with this.

2. If you read the original stories, want to see a more accurate depiction of the fantasy world and character, but don't require the movie to follow one of the original story lines written by REH, you'll almost certainly really like this movie.

From Momoa, to the fantasy landscapes, to the violence, sex appeal, costumes, and feel, this is a very convincing look into the Hyborian Age! Momoa is fantastic as convincing Conan from his looks to his believably in fights. The landscapes are not only fantastic, but feel like the books visually, instead of looking like say Tolkien, Lewis, or the southern Californian desert (Arnie's version). Like the books, characters and costumes are kind of hyper gendered (incredibly masculine violent men and incredibly gorgeous, hyper feminine and sexualized women). In many ways the filmmakers pay homage to and try to appease reader fans (which is odd considering so few exist now). In that way, the movie is very pulpy. It's full of violence, breasts, and a sense of adventuring with a dark tinge, which to me is what the books were. I'm amazed that so many people mention the REH works and complain about a lack of depth in this movie, because he was pretty obvious pulp fantasy. Conan didn't have some insightful message or inner reflection to reveal to readers and he wasn't by any means a complex character. He was a womanizing, head chopping, hard drinking, adventuring badass, because it was fun.

3. As far as a movie critique in general, I agree with almost everything the ""most helpful"" reviewer said. The movie, while really well done technically and entertainment wise, does have some pacing and transition issues. In part I feel that is because they wanted a little too much action and in part, because I know (from special features) that they wanted to show the scope of Conans adventuring life. More slow, downtime scenes would have been nice, more campfire feel stuff.

Warning to some, I got this for Christmas (yay wife!), but my copy which is a non-3D Blu Ray doesn't have the special features on it. I know some do, because I've seen them before. If you can, try to get one with the features because they are pretty good.",1451606400,,3292,4.6284246575342465

I have never read any of the Conan source material, but simply as a film, this fails much more than it succeeds in presenting engaging characters and/or a clear narrative. Jason Momoa is not to blame. He may not be Arnold Schwarzenegger but he has good physique and presence, and with better directing could have brought more charisma to the table. Rather, the problem here is with the producers, writers and director. They may indeed be fans of Conan, but do not seem to have as good a grasp of film-making. There are some good visuals and good lines lurking here and there, but overall this film is convoluted, bland, ugly--and not in the way that it should be--and ultimately forgettable. There is certainly a place for violent gore in this story, but more often than not, it feels aimless and gratuitous here. Which is all to say that this is not a very interesting or rewarding story.

4339993,3,B004EPYZTE,"Conan is back.  New actor Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones) does a good job portraying Conan as he was first conceived by author Howard so many years ago.

 Conan teams up with a pirate friend (actor also from my two other favorites -Game of Thrones & the Bible series) to fight slave keepers and indulge themselves upon the treasures they take through conquest.

 Very weak plot that really had not been explained enough in detail, evil ancient mask that requires the sacrifice of young women of a certain blood type (what for ?) and gives the wearer (super powers I guess?) .

 An evil warlord and his weirdo witch daughter attacks Conan's Cimmerian village where his family is butchered, though not after the noble sacrfice of Conan's father so his son may live an bring these animals to justice.  Conan receives the sword of his father and leads a wondering life of a wild man, barbarian, and pirate although finding ways to free enslaved oppressed people when he can.

 A Shaolin like harmonious temple of happiness and peace is attacked by that same warlord, and an attractive young woman who has the blood type needed for the human sacrifice escapes with Conan's help.  For what ever the reason these two fall in love and then go on the offensive, searching for the lost city to track down this warlord and kill him.  The warlord of course kidnaps Conan's girlfriend along the way so she has to be rescued.

What I did like about the film, good stunts, good costumes, good special effects, plenty of fighting and martial arts cordination, horse riding stunts which I always enjoy, lots of ugly monsters and CGI lost ancient mysterious cities, and of course lots of pretty naked babes with big boobies so I assume most of us men will be satisfied because I sure was.

 What is missing, they really never grasped Howard's original material, nor did they really focus on developing a good solid plot.  Besides being a muscle bound stud, why would this girl just magically fall in love with Conan & vice versa?  It seemed they just threw together any story, filmed a bunch of fight scenes with stunts, added CGI, and then brought in the 3D element into the story culminating into a product they claimed is the ""modern"" Conan franchise.

 I wouldn't mind if they tried this again and really worked hard to bring about a better more solid script, because actor Jason Momoa is very good in this genre and he did master the role of Conan the way he was supposed to be intended to portrayed (not that Arnold's version was wrong in anyway, it was just different from the original material).

 It is in my best judgement that Arnold's two films are the much better Conan movies then this remake.  Hope Hollywood tries again because like other franchises I love, ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", ""Terminator"", ""Batman"", ""The Highlander"", ""Captain America"", ""X-Men"", and ""Game of Thrones"" this Conan franchise is absolutely awesome and among my favorites (at least Arnold's original).

  You may be entertained by this movie but it is certainly not great by any stretch of the imagination.",1422921600,,3072,4.7293233082706765

4340028,1,B004EPYZTE,"Let it be known here and now that my experience with Conan the Barbarian when I watched this movie was perhaps a few stills from the old movie and a paragraph from Temple of the Elephant. So I thought I would watch it, having a mostly fresh brain for it, and hardly any expectation. I mean, I've watched some movies before that were almost universally panned and they turned out not to be maybe not favorites, but at least good. Also, I tend to like gritty movies, and I haven't seen enough fantasy movies to truly grasp the extent to which the film industry utterly and completely fails with regards to fantasy.
This movie blows.
I'd like to say it was okay up 'til the point where Young Conan kills the scouts and spits out the unbroken egg to show that he's manly enough to fight with the warriors, but really, it's kind of crap before then when he's ""born of battle"" and we get to see a crappy CGI baby. Seriously, I have seen more natural-looking newborns in youtube comedy shorts!
Conan himself, well, he's a freaking jerk; I have no sympathy for him, and the only reason I am glad he won is because the bad guys are slightly worse. And that psychotic bald chick; eugh *shudder*. Over-the-top villains are something I expect to see in a kids' movie; the witch-girl is so hilariously awful that I never want to watch another movie with her in it ever again; and I kind of liked Planet Terror! Now it's ruined for me!
Even the good things about this movie are awful. The love interest, Foxyface, is completely useless! The only reason she's there is because the bad guys need her blood and Conan apparently needs her virginity, because sex is what fuels dumb barbarians.
Speaking of which, what's with the crappy sex scenes in movies? Does it add to the plot in any way, shape or form to have ten seconds of Foxyface and Conan humping out in the caves? Even laying aside that it could easily have been tastefully implied that they were having sexytimes, Conan is such a colossal idiot and jerk that they pretty much have to, or else he'd never know she was kidnapped. Also, it's somewhat ironic that the topless slave girls they free near the beginning of the movie are pretty much doing the same thing they were doing as slaves after they've been freed, only it's for Conan and his black friend instead of slavers, so that's okay.
Some thoughts on storyline: Mr. McEvildude goes and murders Conan's papa, stealing the last piece of the tentacle mask in doing so. Then he laughs evilly, swishes his cape and disappears for several years, just long enough for Conan to grow up, get some fighting experience and hunt him down. Why didn't he just go after the blood of Foxyface right after killing Conan's pa? If you're arguing she's not old enough, I say that's pretty much bull pucky; the original ritual used the blood of these kings' virgin daughters, and, well, foxyface obviously ain't a virgin when she's going to be used, so those rules seem pretty flexible. What was he doing for all those years? Searching? He's got his ugly daughter to help with that, and besides; when they head for the place, it's pretty obviously where they need to go; McEvildude's wife was murdered there, so...
Of all the movies I have watched, this is one of them.
I wish it wasn't.
I wish I had skipped the movie and read the books; I've started them and, so far, Howard's Conan is much more interesting than this one. Not a total idiot, not a total douche, though definitely a bit of a jerk. And a rapist, really; I mean, he chased down the Frost God's daughter and tried getting sexy with her (to be fair, she was taunting him, naked in the snow, but still). There are faults with the Real Conan, but I definitely prefer him and his broader character than Knockoff Douchebag Conan.",1420329600,,3770,4.5131578947368425

4340122,2,B004EPYZTE,"First, let me say the first 15 minutes of this film is, very likely, the best 15 minutes of any film I have ever seen.  Perfect timing, setting, feel, and Ron Pearlman!  The young Conan was done well and I see that teenager actor as going far.  I like the villain and his relationship with his daughter.  And the adult Conan looks like the one out of the books.
After that is kind of starts to go down hill.  The fights seem too long and there is too many effects in which computers were used.  Now, to be fair, there was a LOT of wire work and the actors did a lot of their own stunts.  But the end result isn't as grand as it should.  I felt about 20 minutes could have been removed from the movie, easily, without hurting the story or flow of the film.  While many of the places named are in the stories of Conan, many of them are not that close together.
I feel that fans of Conan are going to be a tad disappointed and those who are not fan are not really going to get that excited about the story or the setting.  In fact I sometimes felt I was watching Beastmaster.  I also noticed that the music was very underwhelming, which is almost a sin for a Conan film.
Conan defeats the bad guy in a way that brings closure to his Father's memory but feels like I've seen it before.  In fact, you have seen the ending in a couple of fantasy movies.
In the end, for me, the film went down in fires because of all the nitpicks I started to have after the first 15 minutes.  True, a movie can survive a few nitpicks if it is a good one.  But even the best can crash and burn if a few thousand nitpicks attack it.  Halfway through the film I was no longer inside the movie, enjoying it.  I was outside it, questioning all the decisions made to create it.  Why were the slaves topless?  Because they were on display or because they wanted a R-Rating?  Why did the Picts sounds like pigs?  Or raptors?  Or pig-raptors?  Picts are Scots!
Fans of the Conan setting, of the books and comics, such as myself, may find themselves walking away confused and praying that people stop trying to make Conan movies.  Those who are not fans may enjoy it more but not by much.",1412553600,3,2156,4.154589371980676
4340123,1,B004EPYZTE,"It takes real effort to make a move this bad. Especially when the creativity requires that you make Conans Mom fight on a battlefield 9-months pregnant and fighting ironclad men. How can you expect her not to die?  Why was she wearing armor and wielding a sword? How did Conans dad perform a C-section on his wife without even looking and deliver a baby under 1 second in the middle of a raging battlefield with enemy everywhere?  These are questions that will ponder your mine in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie was pretty much the same way.  Wanton violence for the sake of violence. Conan was whispering the entire movie. His accent varied and his lines were forced. Now I understand why he had no lines in ""Game of Thrones"" and they killed him with an infected paper cut.

I love how the mask was not fully explained and the pure blood was only a small boat ride away from the evil dungeons but it takes over 20 years for the king to find her even though they had a psychic that can read minds and see the future?  Why was the pure blood defended by ninja's that fight like elves?  Why were Indian's trying to kill Conan in the beginning of the movie?

This may just be my own pet peeve but it seems that a lot of today's movies just don't seem to have a truly moving score. The story is one that's best enjoyed without thinking about the specifics too much and the special effects are kind of a mixed bag. Some stuff like the bloodletting scenes works rather well, while things like the CG serpentine monster near the end... not so much. All in all, I've seen a lot worse. It's too bad the producers didn't see fit to concentrate on the story a little more because you can definitely see promise in this movie.

Jason Mamoa is not Arnold and doesn't have the command screen presence. It's ""prettier"" than the original but also more CGI effects ridden and the added story of not only avenging his father but saving the royal blood line. Lots of the movie is ""dark"" and not in the sense of story, but in cinematography as even on dark days, lights off, large screen (39"") some is difficult to see, especially if there is any glare from anywhere. I purchased this as saw it on broadcast TV, but with all the commercials, just couldn't watch it, so ordered it used on Amazon. Glad I did, as if I had paid regular theater price I would have been disappointed but ""used like new"" was worth it. Normally I watch the movies I ordered several times over as they sound good as well as look good. This has a nice ""clear"" look to it, and sounds ""acceptable"" when you're moving around the house (not over blaring) but not sure it's going to be one of those I watch several times over. To be very frank, this isn't one of those movies I'll be watching lots of times. Might watch it again and pass it along to family or friends. It won't stay in my collection.

4340374,4,B004EPYZTE,"As a fan of Conan, I've read several Robert E. Howard novels on the character and religiously followed the marvel adaptations of the novel by way of graphic novels; not to mention consuming with regularity the Dark Horse BW annuals. I've never learned to appreciate the REH novels as I found the storyline boring, the descriptions less than well written by way of descriptive writing and the action scenes less than well encapsulated in the written form and boring. As for the Marvel comics, I found the storyline well written, the characters well drawn, while featuring some of the more alluring women ever drawn; incorporating some of the best known art ever featured in comics by the legendary artist Frank Frazetta whose work has been memorialized in hard-back editions of art books featuring illustrations spanning his career in the comic book industry, primarily cover illustrations for Marvel and Dark Horse. As for the Dark Horse annuals, we are introduced to some of the best drawn illustrations of Conan, as well as mouth-watering women, while being presented with the some of the best stylized and artistically rendered illustrations that constitute the first attempt by the comic industry to feature impressionist like illustrations that also incorporate some of the best storyline ever conceived in comicdom despite being in Black and White. So, when my childhood idol, Arnold Schzenegger ,was chosen to play the part of Conan in a Dino De Laurentis adaptation of the novel, I not only eagerly anticipated the release of the movie but also had high expectations; only to find myself disappointed with a rather poorly conceived storyline, less than inspired acting by Arnorld (despite his ever impressive muscles that was highly emphasized in the movie which presented him with ample opportunities to showcase his well sculptured body), and was let down by the poorly choreographed sword play that was less than inspiring and rather less than exciting; this despite being an aficionado of sword fighting in Shaw Brothers movies as well as kung fu flicks. So, when this remake was released, I was one of the first to watch the movie in 3D, and was greatly impressed with some of the best 3D simulations ever captured on film that featured a rich storyline, well developed characters, some of the most amusing exchanges between Conan and the heroine, some of the best sword fighting sequences ever choreographed and captured on film by Hollywood, while introducing the best ever version of Conan ever encapsulated in film - featuring an unknown actor by the name of Jason Momoa, who, despite lacking the well toned body that has become characteristic of the comic version of Conan, nevertheless, plays the part convincingly. Another worthy note: Rachel Nichols is captivating on film and alluring, and her smile is bewitching, and the amusing exchanges between her and Conan is endearing while the movie features the seat gripping excitement seldom found in Hollywood action films.

A note about the special features: It presents a very informative account of John Howard's life as well as the manner in which Conan developed as a comic book character. Also includes engaging snippets of interviews with the cast & crew as well the director.",1397865600,2,3251,5.088014981273409

I can't get over how bad the acting is or the light feeling. A lot of stuff I seen made me go WTH. Like Conan's father with his hair touching a glowing red hot sword and his hair not burning on fire. How stupid his mom died from being stabbed in the ovaries. Yet blood was coming out of her mouth. Women have suzerain and they don't die with in 3 mins of being cut open. That stupid scene where Conan's father dumps molten steel on his face. How is that metal even hot? They were in battle then blabbed for awhile. I guess heat never dissipates.

A lot of stuff in this movie just happens. With no thought put into it.

The old 80's Conan's are far better, darker and have more fantasy elements.

Unless you can turn your brain off and can stand random no thought moments... Stay away from this movie.",1395446400,,901,4.190751445086705

4340443,1,B004EPYZTE,"This is one of the worst ""reboot"" movies I have ever seen. How do you have good special effects, good looking actors and still manage to mess up a plot so badly? The Conan books are full of GREAT stories and any one of them would have made a better plot than this drivel. It wasn't original. The acting was terrible and there were SO many stupid holes in the plot it was laughable.

Even the beginning was dumb....His mother is dressed as a warrior, looks like a model and is PREGNANT and supposedly in labor as she is fighting this war. Somehow, it goes wrong and Conan gets sliced OUT of his mother becoming a ""war born"" baby. Seriously? I was laughing from this point on. How could anyone even let an opening scene like this be put into a movie? The acting was so bad, college drama students could have done a better job acting these parts. The war scene, the blood and the emotions all seemed 100% FAKE in the opening scene. How is this any way to start a movie? Were they trying to win over the moms and female fans with this beginning? Obviously not! As a woman I found this not quite offensive...just unrealistic and annoying. Did we REALLY need that scene in there? I don't remember anything about Conan being ""war born"" in any of the books or other movies. Why make it a CONAN story when it's a totally different character with a different background from the original guy?

Now lets move on to Conan. Okay...the guy is good looking. But even Arnold in the 80's could deliver a line and had more charisma than this guy. He has no personality as Conan and doesn't have the right personality for the part. He comes off as a pretty boy and it's hard to believe this guy is supposed to be tough and ""war born"" when he looks like he should be an underwear model.

Then, we have the female lead...The VIRGIN! Oh, how original! NOT! This plot detail is this is totally lame and she looks way too OLD to be a convincing virgin. Shouldn't they have made her look 18-21? This woman looks 30. Who even cares anyway if she has ever had sex or not? When we get to the love scene, that is cheesy and unrealistic too. This plot idea was so predictable and dumb by this point you already know exactly how this is going to end...Badly...This is such a clich idea I can't believe they would even put this in a movie in the year 2011. This seems more like a plot from 1950 or 1960. There was nothing original in this storyline and the women playing ""the virgin"" was not even that good of an actress or that good looking. Could they not have found someone with talent? A good action movie with a good plot does not need a cheap sex scene or clich ""virgin"" priestess...but this movie isn't good so maybe they thought they needed this in there.

Finally, we have Rose McGowan. I actually LIKE her acting but there was no way of her saving this movie. She did the role of the ""bad"" character well but it was obvious this was very beneath her ability. She almost seemed to be cringing on some of the lines she had to say and it showed. They also put some VERY weird looking prostatic pushed back ""hairline"" on her forehead that makes her look like an 80 year old man with a balding mullet. She is WAY better looking than the dumb ""virgin"" character yet they manage to make her look awful.

Someone probably thought Rose's ""alien forehead"" was a cool costume idea...It wasn't, at ALL! When you see it on the big screen in a movie theatre like I did you CONSTANTLY have to endure long, focused shots of this awful, fake looking rubber forehead with bad makeup all over it and a weird hairline. So the ONE person in the movie that was nice to look at, fit the part somewhat and could ACT, they ruined the role by making her weird forehead the focus of almost the whole movie. Pretty soon I wasn't even paying attention to the plot, I was just looking at HER FOREHEAD the whole time wondering why any director would put something so fake and low-budget looking into a movie like this. Rose is gorgeous. Why not cash in on that and make her a PRETTY evil character? Were they afraid she would outshine and out-act the ""virgin"" character? Honestly, she should have been the lead not the other actress.

So my advice: Don't bother with this movie unless you are watching it as a comedy. It has some okay action but the lame plot and poor acting totally kill the movie. Even from the opening scene, I knew it was going to suck! When Hollywood makes a remake or ""reboot"" movie as I call it, they really need to make it BETTER than the original. Even with all the amazing effects we have today, the 80's Conan movies are still MUCH more entertaining than this dreck. So just like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, they had to totally mess up what could have been a really cool remake. This movie seemed very poorly thought out when it came to plot, costumes, acting and originality. Most of all it just seems badly directed and carelessly thrown together like someone just to make money and not a genuinely great movie!",1395187200,3,4989,4.353383458646617

4340450,1,B004EPYZTE,"First, this film should not have been made or at least they should have subtitled it something else.  Second, it is not the exact same as the Arnold one, so that is good.

This film, as expected, is dull, has no appeal, bad acting and we could care less about the characters, we only want the movie to end.  Films like these need to have a sense of purpose and adventure - this had none.  Part of the problem is Conan was killer child from the get go and was superman invincible throughout the film.  We never felt that he was in danger because he was always killing at will, regardless of how many things there were.

Compare this to Arnold's film where he was a slave, his mind was of the slave mind, then he turned into a killer and he could be defeated.  Of course, in Arnold's film, he was the main attraction, but the story was much better with no idiotic punchlines and cliches.  That one had a sense of suspense, adventure, the right amount of action and a good story.  Clearly people doing remakes can't even get that right, which is why they are doing remakes!

This is another remake that should not have been made and was a waste for all involved.  If the actors did not need the money, I am sure they would have turned this one down.  Also, Schwarzenegger was of a Germanic descent (other part black) so he fit the Barbarian role.  This Jason Momoa does not of course.  In case you don't know, barbarians were the Germanic tribes who had no history, culture, structure or civilization, but who constantly invaded Europe and harassed Rome until it fell.  Those tribes went onto form the modern nations of The UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Holland, The US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Scandinavia, And the rest of western Europe, including Italy and Spain.  The latter still retained a Roman and African culture.

The bottom line is - stay away from this one.  This cannot be added to the collection - unless you like uninteresting films.  We can't get ""Shaft's""Big Score"" on Blu-Ray, but we can get this?  ""Khartoum"" is limited edition, but we get this?",1390262400,,2091,4.554959785522788

4340464,1,B004EPYZTE,"First, this film is terrible. Second, if you love Conan, you should see it, in part because it genuinely leaves a more favorable impression of the original films, in part because it will allow you to see what a truly horrible script can do to good actors and, in part, because anyone who loves Conan will at least enjoy the action in this unfortunate endeavor. The lead, Jason Momoa, as see in Stargate Atlantis and Game of Thrones is actually quite a decent actor (and getting better with each larger part he plays). Rachel Nichols, of Continuum and The Inside, is very good, having also started out as simply acceptable and improving steadily over the course of her career. There was no reason to think that these two actors, as their abilities stood when filming began, would deliver anything less than a fantastic fantasy film for fan consumption. And, yet, this film disappointed on nearly every level. With the exception of some excellent action sequences, the story was loose and uninspired, the villain was practically a tragedy (played, again, by an actor of greater talent than the role could make use of), the oddity of manufactured romance was uncomfortable and even unlikable in moments of unnecessarily awkward dialogue, and, of course, there was one last great failing that, I think, deserves its very own paragraph.

Conan should be street smart, fighting smart, big and strong, but he should also be stupid, book dumb, not much for the mathematics, bordering on illiterate, and then some.

In the books, as wonderful as they are, Conan is smart, witty, as sort of odd combination of personality traits exist within his hero's persona, and it works because we accept it. But there was a reason Dino De Laurentiis opted for the direction of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1982 film of the same name, not as a learned man of the caliber of the character of Kalidor in Red Sonja but, rather, as a near moron in his weakest moments. What makes a dumb Conan, of such a young age, lovable and relatable is that he doesn't have too many gifts. We don't find it odd that he is so very strong and so very witty and so very cunning and so very capable and so very good at not losing a fight. We find him real. In truth, it was difficult for the world to accept that Schwarzenegger himself is actually a bright man because it seems impossible that someone could have so much of so many different desirable qualities. Momoa is also a bright young man but this brightness, which served him so well in playing other characters, was a detriment in this film as the producers actually made note of his own personal characteristics when envisioning their version of Conan. They saw that he was smart and, suddenly, Conan, as written, as a smart man, witty, charming, no one's fool, became an actual honest to goodness possibility. This would have been fine if Conan was an old man, having lived an old man's life and learned an old man's lessons, but Momoa is a young man and so is Conan, far too young to be so crafty. And so, we all missed out on what could have been a wonderful series of multiple films staring a solid and always enjoyable actor who is young enough to give to the genre a series worthy of our time and fandom because mistakes were made too early in the game to be fixed in post. Instead of that series that will never be, we have this one and only film, and it is terrible. If you think Momoa was to blame, watch Game of Thrones season one. If you blame Nichols, watch Continuum season one. If you blame McGowan, pick up a movie, pretty much anything she's done in the last ten years (other than this). If you do, hopefully you will see what I see, that they couldn't help what this became. The script was poor. The director was lost in the minutia of the action and special effects sequences and missed out on even beginning to craft what we all wanted to see, the big picture, the big story, the thing that makes us watch again and again, even so many decades after we saw it for the very first time. All that concern over story and moments shared between actors that make a film, filling in the cracks and pulling the audience in, all the drama and excitement and, of course, an opponent that doesn't so border on the ridiculous as to render the telling of the story (such as it is) pointless, all of that brilliant concern that we get from the men and women we call great writers and directors was simply lacking here. I don't imagine the production team on this one will make the same mistakes twice and it is just our loss that they made them with this film and not with something no one cared about.

If you are a Conan fan, it is worth the suffering to place it into the dark of your mind, in the catalogue, for comparison sake. If you are not a lover of the books or the other films, you are better off not wasting your time. Good luck in your choice.",1389744000,3,4878,4.466367713004484

4340601,1,B004EPYZTE,"Conan the barbarian is an interesting take on ancient times of clans and fights. The Cimmerians are actually the Kimmerians, who lived in the Northern Black Sea region of today's Turkey and they fought with the Hittites, which was the dominant civilization of the time, seconded only to the Egyptians in level of civilization. None of these historic accounts are in the movie. It is a fantasy tale but lacking very important elements that are in the book. Conan, in the book, is a man of justice and not just a hulk on a rampage for revenge. The structures, especially the so called secret buildings of the monks are preposterous as such large structures were impossible to make in those days. Images are largely influenced by ancient Roman civilization and even Byzantian civilization, both of which came much later. Both the architectural design and clothes should have been different. Acting is poor. There is unnecessary sex scenes which are not ""hot"" or exciting. Fights are too bloody. Whatismore, the most important element from Conan books, which is suspense and Conan trying to solve a mystery, is missing. Also, Conan, in his books, is looking for ""something,"" which is his soul and he is trying to find somewhere to fit in. He is large, capable, smart, speaks languages and a very good fighter but picks his fights. He spent a lot of time with Betul, his pirate wife.

Momoa shines as a closer facsimile of the Conan that Robert E. Howard wrote about.

Save your gold - this movie is a waste of time especially if you ever saw the original 2 Conan classics starring Arnold. The big disappointment(s) was the acting (or lack of it), the story line (wake me up when it's over), the replacement of blood and gore for swordplay, the poor scenery and their choice for the hero of the saga (not the barbarian type).

The film has great visuals, directing, and acting. I would say it is my favourite Conan to date as I prefer this darker, but beautiful, and rugged version of Conan compared to what I have seen before. This movie seemed more faithful to Robert E. Howard's Conan that I remember reading in my youth. I also thought that the film was comparable in quality to other films in this genre, like The Mummy, though without the humour. This time Conan is played more like a Shakespearean play with high drama. If there was one weakness I would say I would have liked to see more character development and less sword swinging action. All in all though a pleasant surprise.

This film was filmed in 2D which might account for the fact that most of the 3D isn't as exaggerated as in movies like Avatar, The Avengers, or Tron.",1386374400,,965,4.514285714285714

4340821,3,B004EPYZTE,"Not bad, but not great. I would have to agree with other reviewers - even though the overall ""look"" of the film is compelling, it somehow lacks the epic feel of the original Schwarzenegger ""Conan."" Ron Perlman and the opening scenes in Cimmeria are the high points of the movie. Jason Momoa has an appropriate physical presence but is a bit too pretty to be a convincing barbarian. And the dreaded Mask of Acheron (spoiler alert) does nothing but morph into a spooky looking custom-fitted helmet? Really? Finally, can we have a break from Morgan Freeman narrations? Where is Mako when you need him?",1383696000,,598,4.759615384615385
4340822,3,B004EPYZTE,"I like the Conan based more on the books than the Arnold version but unfortunately Jason Mamoa doesn't have the charisma the Arnold infused into role, perhaps it was too much dialogue for Conan who should mostly grunt and kill people. Although there is quite a bit of bloody violence, most of it is digital blood sprays but the effect is still pretty cool.

They took visual and story references from the books and comics however the actual movie's story is pretty straight-forward and hackneyed.

The 3D adds some depth but most things are like cardboard cutouts, nothing really pops out except the begining title and the fire ember particles floating during the credits.

So overall it is an entertaining movie if you like bloody action, boobs and not much story. You can probably pass on the 3D version.",1383264000,,806,4.784172661870503

4340875,3,B004EPYZTE,"Honestly... I feel let down... Conan was never this annoying or ""too cool"", Conan was just naturally awesome without even trying. This bratty child who grew up an annoying adult just didn't cut it. I liked the gore, the pretty girl but everything else was just a blur to me. It could have been much better but this is the reason I don't go to the movies anymore. I hope they either just let Conan die and stay untouched from the 80s (while we forget this one ever existed) or if they somehow do another remake, that they do a better job.

What could have been better?

The story - Just too cheesy
The acting - Card board box acting

It's that forgettable.  If Ron Perlman did not appear as Conan's father, doing his usual great job at making everyone around him look half size, I'd be wondering why I was being asked to rate it.
On the other hand, while watching it, it's fairly entertaining.  The young man who plays Conan as a boy (I'm too unengaged to look up his name) is excellent, visceral, and more or less perfect.
They would have been better served to just wait for him to grow up, rather than cast the nonentity who plays Conan as an adult. He's the George Lazenby of Conans.

Unfortunately the movie falls prey to a lot of nasty critics.  So many fan boys of comics and novels cry (myself included) when a movie comes out that completely ignores the source material.  But then when a director actually attempts to ignore typical Hollywood formula and make a film that not only isn't ashamed of the source material but actually celebrates it the same fan boys (not myself) then trash the movie for being to cartoony or too campy.

Momoa does an outstanding job of playing the warrior (in truth, his is closer to the literary Conan than Arnold's films), but the truth is that too many folks cannot get that iconic films out of their heads.  All in all the cast makes it an outstanding film, and for your sword and sorcery ones, this is top-notch.

The bottom line: it's a Conan film, and in truth more Conan than the 80s films, but it's not a ""Conan"" film - and most people see it in that light.  If you're a first time watcher, put aside the Arnold expectations and then you'll have a funtime.",1380844800,,707,4.138686131386861

The girl antagonist is just as laughable.  There are people who can act fantasy so well that the story line becomes almost insignificant.

I wonder if the directors and writers even read the original stories. I personally think that the original film with Ah-nold ""I'll be back"" Schwarzenegger followed Robert Howard's epic storyline better, showing more of the sword and sorcery feel of the ethos than this film did. This film wasn't absolutely terrible, it just missed the mark of what I, as a fan of Conan of Cimmeria, was looking for. This film had some great sword-play, but not much else, and honestly I was bored with it. I was hoping by the end the directors would at least have done something with the tag-line they used so much, but..... nothing. No answer for Conan, like the original at least attempted to do, no inner journey, no nothing. 2 stars, because had the film been released under another name and not tried to ride the coattails of the franchise so dear to many of R.

It is a poorly paced stinker with cheap sets, poor location work, awful continuity, and lingering shots of matte paintings that fail to convince us the generic caves and ruins it takes place in are in fact far-off fantasy cities.

All this is more the shame because Jason Momoa is probably the best Conan ever. He seems to have read Howard's description of the character - ""Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet"" - daily as a primer on the role. He looks the part and acts the part, showing neither Schwarzenegger's endearing but inappropriate humor nor the streaks of predictable heroism one might expect. His Conan is a true barbarian, vicious and lawless, but with a calculating intellect his enemies overlook to their own detriment. This part probably went a long way toward his casting in Game of Thrones, and it's a shame an actor who so thoroughly gets his role is shoehorned into such a tedious film about it.

It should also go without saying but this film's soundtrack is in all ways inferior to Basil Polidorous' rousing, brass-heavy war-anthems of the original.",1376870400,,1446,4.756972111553785

Mamoa has magnetic charisma and, I think, serves as an excellent anchor for a mostly mindless (by design) action flick.

4341425,3,B004EPYZTE,"Given the legendary status of the 1982 classic of the same name, watching this re-make without any comparison with original proved to be impossible. So I watched it twice, the second time purely to digest this film on its own merit. Overall, I believe that it was a respectable attempt to capture the magic and sweeping majesty of the 1982 version, and that the cast took this enterprise seriously, but it was not a great film. The success of the original was, to a large degree, due to the creative team and the cast's ability to transport the audience to a different world, a world of high adventure prior to recorded history, and kept them there for the duration of that film. In this regard, Arnold's limited acting ability, strange (at the time) accent, equally strong accents by some of the other cast members, and stilted dialogue did not hurt the effort; in fact, these factors actually enhanced the film by presenting to the audience a sense of exoticism that people could rightfully expect from a mythical world tens of thousands of years ago. Arnold's rather thin acting skills actually gave his cinematic interpretation of Conan a sense of bombastic grandiosity, which is why Conan is still one of Arnold's most celebrated roles. The original film was also balanced very well on a character and a thematic basis, which is a sign of the creative depth of the original team. On Conan's side: Conan's indomitable masculinity was balanced by Valeria's raw physical femininity; Conan's implacable strength was balanced by Subotai's wit, speed, and deadly accuracy. Thematically: Conan's physical power and strength of will were balanced by Thulsa Doom's towering charisma and insidious intellect. The entire cast was giving enough material to be memorable, especially the bad guys. The portrayal of Thulsa Doom by the incomparable James Earl Jones created one of the most well-known villains in cinematic history. Even his henchmen were memorable: who doesn't remember the hulking bearded blade master who was finally bested by Conan and Valeria, or the Hammer Guy? Despite their relatively few scenes, their treatment in the film gave even minor characters enough credibility as powerful bad guys not to be taken lightly in the context of the film. The music, despite the times, is still celebrated as a master piece.
For the new film, from the poster and still shots, it would appear that the film makers captured the Conan from the books: imposing, dark, and brooding. The stills of the veteran actor Stephen Lang as the antagonist Khalar Zym were also impressive. From what I can see, serious money was spent on creating sets and visual effects for the world of Conan. However, it was the delivery that was off. The speech and mannerisms of the cast all came off as too modern, too familiar, and in some cases, too slick and polished. So despite that the visual aspects of the film were attempting the transport the audience to a different world of fantasy and adventure, the cast's acting and speech kept bring the audience back to the here and now. This is especially disappointing given how successfully Jason Mamoa portrayed an ancient warrior on the small screen in The Game of Thrones. Also, other than Conan and Khalar Zym, none of the other characters were given enough material or treatment in the film to be particularly noteworthy in the context of the film. They could be easily dismissed as ""henchmen 1, 2, 3"" ""damsel in distress,"" ""happy pirate buddy,"" etc. It's not a very engaging film that can grab and retain the audience's undivided attention from the beginning to the end. In this regard, I don't blame the actors, they are all decent to good actors for the most part, the script, directing, and editing have much to do with the success of a film, and these elements did not mesh very well for this one.",1375833600,,3834,4.863914373088685

I am happy to report that this movie is not bad, not a grand piece, but it has quiet a few moments when it shines.  The movie does have its downsides, mainly almost no character depth outside of Conan and his father, and the cartoony main villain.  I do like the origin part of the movie, it seemed more realistic while still staying epic, a little insight into Conan's childhood and the double tragedies of his parents' deaths that shaped his adulthood.  Ron Perlman as Conan's father was terrific, just enough emotion and subtlety to show that he loved his son dearly and worked hard to make Conan a man that could one day be a noble and just warrior.  The idea of Conan being born literally in the heat of battle was a nice touch as well.

I purchased this DVD as a fun 'whatever' gift to a wonderful person with (presumably) good taste in other areas, who - for whatever reasons - wanted to own it.

Possible reasons to own it may include: a view of a gratuitously bare buttoxed Conan (Jason Momoa) in the movie's obligatory 'sex in an atmospherically lit room' scene, as well as a fantastic view of the behind of leading lady Tamara's (Rachel Nichols) bedroom double. Although I'll admit I was mildly disappointed to learn that it was not actually Rachel Nichols performing nude.... still, you can't criticise THAT. I mean, look at that.

So we'll give 'Conan 2011' a star for gratuitous shots of female and male buttocks.

bing! *

And I applaud the director's (Marcus Nispel) decision, knowing that his movie already had a hard R-rating for graphic violence, to show us some of Bulgaria's Most Beautiful Bosoms. Too long have American R-rated movies suffered from a dearth of breasts. I remember a time (the 1980s) when the average movie viewer could reasonably expect an R-rated film to contain at least one gratuitous full frontal shot of Jamie Lee Curtis's or Tanya Roberts' breasts. Then came the travesty that was the 90s, and Jet Li's 'Cradle 2 The Grave' - a god awful R-rated 'action' flick which contains a dance/striptease scene in which THE BARE-TORSOED ACTRESS DOES NOT EVEN TURN AROUND. I should've asked for my money back. For shame, Hollywood.

So we'll go right ahead and give 'Conan' another star for its show of appreciation for natural, womanly beauty, and for putting the 'Right On!' back in R.

bing! **

And for those of you hating on Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) because he's not James Earl Jones, I give you Akhun, portrayed by 6-foot-11, 360lb Australian powerlifter and wrestler Nathan Jones (no relation).

It is a proven fact that a giant man who roars his lines, beats his chest in fury, and wields a 'Thorgrim' war-hammer makes any sword and sorcery flick better. Nathan Jones, whose character has lines and who has never gotten his collarbone broken by Cro Cop, gets no billing at all in the main credits; but American MMA guy Bob Sapp, as Ukafa, has no lines at all, yet he gets his name printed on the DVD case AND in the end credits?!?

So we'll give 'Conan' another star for Nathan 'RRRRGGHAAAAAGGH!' Jones, to correct this obvious oversight in the movie's credits. IMO, Nathan Jones should appear in every sword n' sorcery and sword n' sandal and Asian martial arts flick, roaring and swinging a ridiculously heavy spiked mace-hammer thing at everybody, because I say so.

bing! ***

Having said that, I think other reviewers nailed it when they wrote, essentially, 'Take away the name Conan and this movie could be any generic sword and sorcery story.' I don't have much to add to that.

In most of Robert E. Howard's stories, the Conan character was almost like Blackbeard without the beard, and (mostly) without the ship. Barbarians and desert tribesmen in Howard's Hyboria followed Conan into battle, not only because Conan's fighting skills impressed them, but because he was their meal-ticket. Conan loved to fight and rarely lost a battle. He loved to steal treasure, to pillage, to captain pirate vessels, and he loved to lead hordes of ravening barbarians and/or howling desert tribesmen against armies of 'civilised' opponents. Conan was mostly amoral, but with his own barbaric code of honour, and he possessed a William Wallace-like charisma with the warrior classes. He spent his gold as fast as he got it, loved the women, loved the booze, loved to party, and it took a twist of fate during a major rebellion (with Conan strangling the despotic King of Aquilonia on his own throne, and seizing the crown by conqueror's right) to finally settle him down to a life of responsibility.

Conan was a criminal vagabond, a schemer, a sellsword and a hardcore killer. Howard's primary concept was pretty far from any notions of 'knightly derring-do' or 'noble savagery,' which was part of what made Howard's Conan 'yarns' so much fun: the unpredictability of Conan. Conan wasn't hampered by the laws and taboos of any nation he visited; he did absolutely whatever he could get away with.

At its core, 'Conan 2011' is just your basic action movie. Overall, the stuntwork and the fights are well executed, but a lot of the action suffers from a lack of intensity and craziness and 'total battle chaos' that (in my opinion) ought to be the main attraction in any Robert E. Howard adaption. Some of the action here, unfortunately, feels a little too much like Stephen Sommers' remake of 'The Mummy' (1999), fortunately without the latter's corny humour.

Then again, I'm not so sure that 'Conan 2011' was given enough of a budget to create those kinds of battle scenes, battles that could've propelled the movie into that Peter Chan's 'Warlords' or 'Braveheart' territory, which is what any Robert E. Howard adaption truly deserves. It definitely should've been budgeted for that, because why would anyone want to go see a movie based on Howard's writing, where the battle action hasn't been budgeted up to the max?

Jason Momoa does his competent best, but all in all the storyline is too generic and the script too weak to allow him to be very 'Conan-like.' Credit is definitely due to this unknown actor (I'd never heard of Momoa before this), who pulls off some difficult Hong Kong stuntman style jumps and falls, that I've rarely seen a non-pro wrestling Westerner perform (because you can really get hurt doing such stunts). It's a wonder he didn't seriously injure himself, since he's obviously not wearing any protective gear on his arms and torso.

And if they ever decide to make Howard's 'A Witch Shall Be Born' into a movie, I believe Marique (Rose McGowan) could easily step into the role of Salome/Queen Taramis, and nail that character to the wall a la Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue in 'The Two Towers.' Although, sadly, I don't think such a film will ever be made, because of the many weaknesses in 2011's 'Conan the Barbarian.' It's a shame that Howard's writing rarely - if ever - gets the cinematic treatment it fully deserves.

Final verdict: file this one under `Remakes - Missed Opportunities' and hurry up, because by the end of the 2010s, you might not find any room to file anything else in there.",1374624000,,6513,4.804289544235925
4341527,2,B004EPYZTE,"Conan The Barbarian (2011) is a terribly disappointing movie.

If this film had not been called Conan The Barbarian, it wouldn't demand comparison the classic 1982 movie, and might not seem so utterly fail-y.

If it was not Conan, and just a generic sword-and-sorcery movie, it would still be just as bad, just less disappointing.

But really, every cent spent to produce or view this movie is pretty much a waste.

I promise I wasn't expecting much, but somehow I still got so much less.

To be fair, I LOVE the '82 original, and having watched it recently, it still totally stands the test of time.

Conan1982 is often scared, vulnerable, naive, and tender.  Sometimes he wins, sometimes he gets his a$$ beat. He loves, is loved, loses his heart's desire, and is ultimately transformed.  He questions his own place in the world and becomes a greater, more heroic person for it.

Conan2011 has no heart.  With the exception of the barbarian equivalent of pulling the rug from under someone, he doesn't learn a thing the entire movie. (Note: he begins the movie at about age 11 or so, so this is super problematic for me.)  There is ZERO arc to him, any other character, or to the story.

Also, what the heck was the mask supposed to do anyway?  It never did a thing except look gross and wiggly, like a leprous starfish.  At least in (the not-as-bad-as-Conan2011) Conan the Destroyer, the statue came to life at the end and did something.

If you are inclined to watch this, do yourself a favor and watch the original instead.",1374537600,,1527,4.62453531598513

4341797,3,B004EPYZTE,"But, if you know the Conan franchise, you will see quite a few differences. This was good but the original was better. There are a few highlights here that make it worth watching. The young Conan was portrayed by Leo Howard, who has a bright future in acting.

4341799,2,B004EPYZTE,I like Jason Momoa but he is no Conan by any stretch. This movie had a big budget and that is the only thing positive to be said about it. There was so much more dialog in this reboot than the 82 version but it felt thin and very cookie cutter Hollywood style. The movie has its moments but they are few and far between.  Pack on about 40 pounds more muscle and cut the wasted dialog and Momoa could make a great barbarian but Arnold will always be Conan.,1370995200,,455,4.055555555555555

4341892,5,B004EPYZTE,"I loved Jason Momoa's character from the Stargate Atlantis series, so I thought this woukld be a good movie for him, but for some reason I kept missing it at the theatre.  I had it on my list of DVDs to purchase, but it never rose to the top of the list.  Then....  I got hooked on the Disney series Kickin' It with Leo Howard.

That young man is a fantastic Karate champion.  For real.  I think he's a two time world champion.  Anyway, I found out that he played the younger Conan in this movie and did a fantastic job.  So, the movie got put to the top of my list.  Wow.  It's worth the purchase price just to see Leo Howard at the beginning of the movie.  Actually, I think they expanded the beginning of the movie because he did such a fantastic job.  Talk about ability and drive.  This young man has it.

After they show Conan grown up and being played by Jason Momoa, it was still a good movie to watch.  The back story of what happened when he was young drives him as a man.  It makes for a great storyline.  The costuming and special effects were excellent and did not disappoint.  Overall I really enjoyed it, but being an admirer or the real life talents and skills of Leo Howard definitely has put this movie in my repeat watch favorite movie list.",1369008000,,1260,4.200836820083682

4342022,3,B004EPYZTE,"Apparently, this film took place during the dark ages......or.......everything bloody had to take place on a dark day.  I don't know how else to explain why the filmmakers took every opportunity to stage the bulk of the swordplay in dark ill-lit interiors or during the gloom of day.  They were also inordinately fond of nighttime scenes.  The battle to end all battles took place in a dark cave barely lit by torches.  I ache for the days when movies were made in such a way that everything could be seen.  Otherwise, what's the point?  What's the point in staging elaborate sword fights if they're next to impossible to see?  Especially in this case, when the film is little more than a series of fight sequences strung together.  What little plot there was involved multiple quests for a pure blood woman, parts of a magic mask, and, of course, vengeance.  Lots of locales are visited, each thoughtfully provided with an onscreen place name.  Both good and bad, this movies rushes along at a fast pace hardly allowing for anything to register.  Very little of it is memorable.  Everything is so carefully orchestrated that the results seem mechanical and by the numbers.  This is supposed to be a sword and sorcery film, where's the magic?  There's plenty of swordplay but little in the way of the supernatural.  What little there is conjured up belongs to the dubious charms of Marique (Rose McGowan) the witch daughter of Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang).  Rose McGowan gives what amounts to the laziest performance by channeling Freddy Krueger right down to the knives/fingers.  If this isn't an act of plagiarism, I don't know what is.  Every nuance of her ""witch"" is a clich.  Unfortunately, she is not the lone straggler as far as performances go.  Jason Momoa as Conan takes the honors as the worst of the lot by snarling on cue while glaring mightily.  That's the extent of his range.  If scowling were a fine art, he'd still fall short of the mark.  He has only one facial expression barely visible under his mop of hair.
For all the savagery depicted, this film is curiously detached, passionless, with characters as cold as the sets they pose on.  I forgot what I saw the moment the film was over.  Hardly a glowing endorsement.",1366156800,2,2235,4.727979274611399

Conan meets with a beautiful preistess named Tamara who is the last of an ancient blood line that's needed to activate the mask, the two fall in love and she tries to save him by sacrificing herself. Conan then makes a daring raid into the warlord's castle intent on finding Tamara and destroying the mask once and for all. A good retake on the Conan series.",1365379200,4,843,4.375796178343949

There are hunky muscular men for the ladies, topless women for the men, over-the-top gore and ridiculous hats all in keeping with the genre.  If you want to watch something innovative, then don't watch a remake.  If you want to watch refined art, then what are you doing looking at this movie!?

Jason Momoa is perfectly cast as Conan and he does Conan as one expects Conan to be played.  The female lead isn't a whiny helpless twit as in the old Arnold version, but can fight for herself and still look good in a silly dress.  Also, it has Ron Perlman and the bad guy from Avatar.

The actor doesn't quite fill the sandals of the Arnold rendition of Conan, and almost seems amused in some scenes that he is even there. He just doesn't measure up to the larger-than-life, and stronger-than-a-bull stereotype of the Conan character. Action scenes are plentiful and well-choreographed, and cinematography satisfactory.

1.) Editing was just awful, supposedly there's this huge world that Conan is supposed to travel, yet he seems to arrive at each location in a manner of seconds.

2.) Conan was very one dimensional. Sure he was shown as being a bit more creative in fighting his opponents and made him into more of a rogue, cheater, stealthy guy. But his motives and personality were very one note and not interesting at all.

3.) Let's talk about the editing again, IT SUCKED! It made the action sequences very boring and generic.

4.) The acting was pretty bad, Conan's voice cracked a few times from trying to sound deeper than it normally was. There's nothing to write home about with one exception, I did enjoy watching the villain.",1364601600,,847,4.516339869281046

The problem with Conan the Barbarian 2011 is that everyone keeps comparing it to the Conan the Barbarian 1981, both of these films are great movies in their own right. The thing that people should do is to not compare the two movies to each other, but compare them to the source material. Have any of you actually read the Conan stories written by Robert E. Howard?

Conan The Barbarian 2011 brings Conan to his actual origin story; Howard did mention that Conan was born on a battle field and that he was an accomplished warrior before the age of 13. The bloody violence of this film captured the violence of the books. Jason Mamoa's sword choreography was far better than Arnold's swordsmanship in the original. I will admit that the main villian fell short of James Earl Jones' charismatic performance of the original. Rose Mcgowan stole the show for me in this version. The 1982 version did have one of the greatest sound tracts ever recorded.

Conan the Barbarian 2011 is an incredible and refreshing retelling of Robert E. Howard's greatest literary hero. In time this film will get the credit it deserves, and it will become a cult classic. Personally I love both the 1982 and 2011 versions the same.",1363824000,12,1427,4.745967741935484

The 1982 version was all loaded with plot and a lot less action creating a sense a evil, good, and pleassure.  This 2011 version did not even make much sense let alone create any feeling of good of evil other than as shamelessly spelled out by naming characters ""monks"" or whatever.  Also, as an epic tale the cast of 30 was just another shortcoming to go with the lost plot.  The 1982 version had hundreds of extras really adding to the image of completeness.  Am sure there are many who would like this version better.  For them I would suggest the recent Mission Impossible (Impossibly ridiculous)  movies by Tom Cruise, bad acting, no plot, and no congruence.  For those who like to become engaged mentally this is definitely not the one to watch.  In this, the hero always wins, the bad guy almost always comes up short.

4342346,3,B004EPYZTE,"The ill-conceived CONAN THE BARBARIAN remake is an absolute mess of a film that places bloody violence and over-budgeted effects over character and story. While it attempts to remain closer to the works of Robert E. Howard, it lacks the heart and epic qualities of Howard's writing. The casting is like a bad joke. Jason Momoa may look the part, but his over-confidence and exaggerated expressions come off as being silly instead of stern and powerful. There is no consistency whatsoever in the accents or dialects of the various groups of people that Conan encounters in his travels. The world of Hyboria is dramatically reduced as a result, especially considering how quickly Conan is able to travel from land to land in search of his betrayers. Most of the story and background are related by an unseen narrator, who quickly tries to piece things together for the audience in between the overblown action sequences. Zym is a bland and forgettable villain that would cower before James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom. What is worse, the grand scheme that has taken him over 20 years of battling and searching to complete is spoiled in one brief and unsatisfying final conflict. This consists mostly of unbelievable feats and unnecessary computerization. The only entertainment comes from the absurd amount of bloodshed and heavy reliance on nude wenches. For mindless sword-fighting and mayhem, CONAN is a serviceable action flick, but in all other ways, it is utterly underwhelming.

4342349,4,B004EPYZTE,"Wow, this is a super gore fest compared to Arnie's 1982 version. I'm glad they did not remake the original but did a different story.

As in 80s Conan The Barbarian and Conan The Destroyer, the villain Khalar Zynn's (Stephen Lang) mission is similar - world domination. To do so, he must find pieces of the mask and use pure blood to activate the powers.

Zynn engineers the demise of Conan's father Corin (Ron Pearlman) for one piece of the mask and a young Conan (Leo Howard) vows revenge.

This Conan delivers action and gore fast and furious. I thought the most exciting segment was the battle with sandmen. The parts with the snake/octopus creature and the final fight sequence were a little too dark for me to really see what was going on.

Ron Pearlman (Hellboy) puts on a memorable performance here as a dad who sacrifices his life. And Rose McGowan (Scream) really did look super evil with all that fingernails (Freddy Krueger!). Her sorceress Marique made Zynn look like Father Christmas. Watch her stick those nails into those poor girls! Speaking of incest, the deviant attempts to seduce her daddy. Funnily enough her make up reminded me of Helena Bonham Carter in Alice In Wonderland.

Casting Jason Monoa as Conan was a brave choice as he was a relative unknown then. He certainly has the looks and  killer bod - check out those glutes!

The version released in my country clocks in at 108 minutes compared to the 113 minutes version sold here. I'm sure a raunchy love scene between Conan and the pure blood heroine Tamara (Rachel Nichols) was cut. Someone kindly confirm?

Extras include cast and crew interviews a B roll footage and a trailer. The questions were flashed so quickly that I could not read them.

I would have given this five stars if not for the censorship. Even though this 2011 version did not break even at the box office, it's a worthy movie to add to your Conan collection. If there's a sequel, BRING BACK GRACE JONES!",1359158400,6,1955,4.643478260869565

4342411,2,B004EPYZTE,Conan material has the elements to be an epic movie. This one falls very short of being more than a standard action movie with nothing that really sets it apart from 100 other titles done like this. I was very let down.

4342412,2,B004EPYZTE,"I was prepared to like a remake of the Arnold star-maker of the 80s. And I didn't mind the story changes at all, since I was expecting that.

However, I didn't like the portrayal of the young Conan. This kid had a scowl on his face every time you saw him, and he looked at his father like he hated his guts. Is this how the director made the young Conan look tough? He looked like a juvenile delinquent who was mad at the world. So, of course, when he broke down when his father died, well, it seemed out of character.

The two principal female characters always looked like they just stepped out of a beauty parlor, with lipstick and eye enhancement, especially the wicked witch, so not very convincing in their roles.

But my major complaint was with the editing of the fight scenes, of which there are quite a few. I got a headache trying to follow the action. Oh, there was a lot of action and loud noise, and I normally like to watch a good fight scene, but not in this movie. When there was action, it was so fast that all I could see was a lot of movement. Mind you, I don't want to see the fight scenes in slow motion, but I felt the film editing was at fault. I understand some young movie fans like the action depicted like this, but I can't imagine why. It reminded me of some of the terrible previews of today, with fast-action biff-bam-boom in every scene, and if you blink your eyes you miss it.

And I missed an intriguing villain like James Earl Jones, and the rousing background music by Basil Pouledouris was definitely a plus in the original. And I thought there was too much gratuitous violence, with blood spattering everywhere, in this version of the Conan story.

I'm glad I saw it in a DVD borrowed from the library. I would definitely be angry if I paid good money for this. Too bad for the actor, in a way.

4342461,5,B004EPYZTE,"Sadly guys have to watch a movie that takes place thousands of years ago to find a true man.
Conan is the Alpha Male in the purest sense. He doesn't just wield steel, he is a warrior's steel.
He lives, he loves, he slays and he is content. He lives free in the world. A free Man, he is ruled by no one.
Jason Momoa embodied Conan completely.

The scenes with Tamara (Rachel Nichols) were priceless. She arrogantly thought she could tell Conan what to do and how to do it.  Thinking she could just say ""I'm going if you want to help, you have to come along"" In response Conan tied her up. Even tied up she wouldn't shut up. Trying to demand he untie her. Conan just put a piece of cloth in her mouth said ""QUIET""

Sure enough, what followed was a clumsy medley of tedious clichs that lack mythology or importance--that failed in all critical areas: writing, acting, and score. Even the production values brought nothing of interest. Whatever liberties the 1982 adaptation took with Howard's canon, John Milius established a setting that gave weight and authenticity to Howard's artificial mythology, insuring the film would endure the years.

If people want to watch sex, there are plenty of places for it.  In the movies, why not keep romance as a tantalizing idea rather than forcing sex upon the audience, and the actors.

4342500,2,B004EPYZTE,"I'm not terribly familiar with the Conan series, although I know the basic plot and some of the characters. I can see why people enjoy the stories and the original film; they had a fantasy charm that was larger than life and provided some fun and memorable moments. That makes it all the more puzzling why this reboot exists, although with the state Hollywood is in these days I guess I'm not surprised. In short: this film is great for a laugh but serves little purpose beyond that. The characters are one-dimensional and completely uninteresting, meaning that it's hard to feel any connection to them. A majority of the players serve no purpose and by the end you'll probably forget who's who or lose your ability to care.

The story itself is simplistic and the action sequences serve no real purpose other than to keep the viewer interested. I can't recall a single battle or fight that got me emotionally invested or felt like it had any bearing on the plot. Each one was the same thing: Conan yells and randomly charges in, a mediocre battle with shaky-cam editing ensues, and then it's off to the next one. There are some gory deaths along the way that aim to be creative but fall flat. Like the battles, they feel unnecessary and grow old rather quickly.

However, it's the CGI that stands out. Not because it's superb but due to it being painfully bad. Granted, most CGI is noticeable to the human eye and often has trouble seamlessly blending into a film. Here it's just laughable and far to obvious. The original looked gritty and at least gave you the impression that it was a living, breathing world. Modern technology, as great as it may be, has ruined a lot of this effect and this movie is a prime example of what happens when you take a big budget and put spectacle over story. The pacing, effects, and characters are just awful. The film attempts to be epic and instead reeks of having too many haphazard elements thrown together without fleshing any of them out.

I started laughing within the first ten seconds and that continued for the entire duration. My wife and I enjoy having bad movie nights once in a while and this film certainly fits the bill. It's terrible but at least fun enough to laugh at as mindless entertainment, hence the two star rating. Just watch it on Netflix and save the room on your shelf for something worthwhile.",1354752000,,2360,4.587677725118484

4342508,4,B004EPYZTE,"I want to start this review off by talking about the 3D version of this film. If you are looking for pop outs, this is not your movie. There is maybe two scenes of SLIGHT pop outs. The depth on the other hand want to bad. Nothing like Avatar, but out was pretty decent, but nothing that really makes you go WOW!

  Now onto the 2D version. The color is really great looking, even the dark scenes. The landscapes are very vast and beautiful, and really just suck you into the film. The audio really kicks ass also with 7.1 dts. You hear every sword hit, scream, and every piece of flesh rip.

  Jason Momoa does a fantastic job as Conan. His size and build make you believe he is a Barbarian. His acting was spot on, he looks like a wild animal on the prowl for his next meal. I also have to give a shout out to the young boy who played the younger Conan. He is just brutal, and will definitely leave a lasting impression on you.

  I think alot of people give this movie a bad rap, because they compare it to the original, and even though this is a remake, they didn't base it on the first Conan movie, it was actually based on the Dark Horse Comics. If you have ever read these comics you know they are alot darker and brutal than the Conan movie with Arnold, and in this sense this movie totally succeeds.

  If your into brutal fights, blood magic, and an occasional view of breasts, give it a chance and  check it out, even if you just rent it.",1352592000,,1448,4.146953405017921

The action was top notch the kind of gore and brutality you expect from this type of film.

4342636,2,B004EPYZTE,"Overall a pretty disappointing movie. Turned Arnies portrayal into sub performing joke of a great character.

1. Conan was not only a giant among men in character but a large barbarian in stature as well.

2. His story is a sad story and one that left him a brooding man who disdained magic and never trusted most wizards. This Conan was neither brooding nor afraid of magic he acted more like a teenage D&D wanna-be

3. terrible editing, a few scenes were so chopped you can easily tell when the cameras started rolling, and the story was not smooth in transition

Personally this needed to be an epic film. Instead it turned the quiet brooding barbarian into a serial blabbering made for TV child film with no mystery. Doyle must be rolling in his grave at the slandering and maiming of one of his best characters. Perhaps an insightful director and producer can yet salvage and create a masterpiece if they really understand the character and his story.

Will never recommend this movie to anyone and thankfully I got to see it for free because it is not even worth $5.00 in a Walmart bin",1347926400,,1091,4.574358974358974

4342660,3,B004EPYZTE,"As Conan the Barbarian (2011) begins, a baby is born on the battlefield, literally cut from his mother's womb as swords clash around them. The scene oozes delicious, delicious cheese, and if the rest of the movie had followed suit, this may very well have been a four or five star review (what? I like cheesy movies). Unfortunately, save for a few action highlights, things go downhill from there.

The entirely unmotivated romance between Conan and his damsel-in-distress-of-the-week is a major problem with the movie. Jason Momoa as Conan has a kind of blunt charm to his character, but it is very rarely apparent in his interactions with Tamara, his love interest. Her attraction to him comes out of nowhere, and what little character development she had is lost as soon as she falls for Conan. She shows a few traces of personality towards the beginning and middle of the film, but by the time the final battle rolls around, she is reduced to screaming and being nobly willing to die to protect Conan. Cutting Tamara from the movie entirely would have fixed a number of the problems I had with it. (Another way to fix those problems, of course, would be to give her character development and a purpose. Somehow, I'm not holding out much hope.)

The villainess Marique is a far more interesting character who also suffered from underdevelopment. Despite the fact that her motivation seems to be ""daddy issues,"" it's still far better than Tamara, who had no motivation at all. Her powers and appearance are intimidating and mysterious as well. Unfortunately, the writers seemed to run out of ideas for her, resulting in a lackluster final battle and death. Similarly, her father started off strong, with an interesting backstory that promised more than it actually delivered. In the final battle, he is reduced to a cackling and ineffectual villain who is dispatched in the most cliched possible way, with no real consequences for the protagonists.

In fact, the entire second half of the film is only borderline watchable, though there are a few worthwhile scenes. Namely, Jason Momoa dual-wielding greatswords. In fact, I feel like the movie would have been vastly improved if 99.9% of it had consisted of Jason Momoa dual-wielding greatswords.

Even with the reservations I've mentioned (and those I haven't), Conan the Barbarian was largely entertaining. The action is fun, the dynamic between Conan and Artus is convincing (and he lives! Although, admittedly, this is because he drops out of the plot entirely and is replaced by a somewhat whiny one-eyed thief who is not even present for the final battle), and the depiction of Conan's childhood is pretty good storytelling, though over far too soon. The first half of the movie is far better than the second, but the whole thing is watchable and reasonably fast-paced, so despite its two-hour runtime, you don't get the feeling you've wasted a large chunk of your life.

If you enjoy riffing on movies or would like to watch some standard sword and sorcery fare, this movie is definitely rentable, but I wouldn't recommend it for a permanent space on your DVD shelf.",1347667200,,3125,4.922201138519924

He's by far the best thing about this film. i really wish we'd have gotten a bit more of an epic story. I really liked Stephen Lang in the villain role, though i wished he chewed more scenery. And the action beats were good with verygood pacing. But the mcguffin of the story, the mask of Acheron does like nothing once it's put together.

I knew nothing about him but, when watching the movie, I felt that he must have had some martial arts training.... I googled him and sure enough he started training when he was 4... and is a champion.  That kid is bad-@#$ss and it showed!  I think great things are in store for him.  One thing I really didn't like about the movie was the gratuitous nudity that wasn't necessary to the plot... but, I guess guys won't watch a movie without it????!

4342724,3,B004EPYZTE,"The character of Conan the Barbarian needs no new introduction. Most people know a few things about the pop culture icon Robert E. Howard created, which Arnold Schwarzenegger played in the 1982 film adaptation. In the 2011 ""reboot"" of the Conan franchise Jason Momoa plays Conan the Cimmerian seeking for revenge, being the sole survivor of the massacre by Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang), a cold-blooded warlord.

The film starts out promisingly, but it then goes downhill, descending into a sort of randomly assorted action set-pieces. The story often feels rushed, jumping from one action set-piece to another, without telling us much about the characters we are supposed to care. Jason Momoa looks perfect as a sword-wielding hero, but what he does soon becomes repetitious. Rachel Nichols (a 2009 film ""Star Trek"") plays Tamara, a character that always looks bored. In fact, Rose McGowan's character, an evil sorceress with a Goth makeup, was much more interesting with knowingly campy overacting.

The film's action is certainly gory and visceral, with the stunt that in itself is decent, but ""Conan the Barbarian"" lacks creativity and imagination. The hectic editing that hardly lets us know what is going on does not help.

It seems Marcus Nispel, who began his career as a film director with the 2003 version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" is specializing in remaking. ""Conan the Barbarian"" is the fifth work directed by Mr. Nispel, whose previous works include the 2004 made-for-TV film ""Frankenstein,"" ""Pathfinder,"" a remake of a Norwegian movie, and the 2009 version of ""Friday the 13th."" I have only seen two of them (""Texas"" and ""Friday""), and was not impressed. They are not terrible; they are just mediocre, just like the new ""Conan"" here.",1343088000,,1752,5.118881118881119
4342725,2,B004EPYZTE,"I read the original Conan series after seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger muscling it up as the titular beefcake hero in multiple films. To my delight Conan was much more verbal and a lot less muscle-bound in Robert E. Howard's fiction. I can only assume that's what the producers were striving for when they decided to remake ""Conan the Barbarian.""

In so many ways, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is similar to ""Immortals"": nave but violent young man (Leo Howard as young Conan) witnesses a parents' death (Ron Perlman as Corin), swears to avenge himself on the megalomaniac (Stephen Lang as Khalar Zym) responsible, stumbles across a beautiful yet chaste priestess (Rachenl Nichols as Tamara) who just happens to be the Chosen One that the megalomaniac is hunting, the villain manages to capture an artifact without her help anyway, and then in a final climactic battle the hero duels the madman over some precipice. If that's all there was to ""Conan the Barbarian"" it would be a passable if unremarkable film. But this is Conan the freaking Barbarian we're talking about, so that's not good enough.

Things aren't helped by the fact that adult Conan doesn't appear on screen for the first 15 minutes; that Conan has no character development whatsoever (he's more interesting as a child than a man); that most violence seems to be less about slashing and instead clubbing people with swords so that special effects blood appear at random; and cliffs and forest terrain appear completely out of nowhere.

""Conan"" does get a few things right. Topless women abound. There's definitely a Lovecraftian feel to the Dweller, but after seeing the villain's men marching in uniform black armor accompanying a ship carried by elephants, it's hard not to make parallels to ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. Because Conan never manages to really create a sense of place, it just seems like it ripped off other, better fantasy films.

And that's a shame. Jason Momoa does a good job of making Conan more than muscles, although he has those in spades too. His spunky sidekick Tamara stands out in sharp contrast to the other Hyborean women, but she never does anything noteworthy enough to matter. Tamara's the same helpless princess in all the Conan stories, only now she juts out her lip and claims she's ""no man's property."" Of all the characters, the only one of interest is Rose McGowan's Marique, managing to create a sexy/creepy villainess with incestuous undertones. SPOILER THE BARBARIAN: Marique uses her magic on a special effect that seems wasted (sand dwellers aren't the archetypical Conan monster I would have picked) and she suffers an ignominious death that's not worthy of the character, but that's note McGowan's fault.

In the end, ""Conan the Barbarian"" bears little resemblance to the books that inspired it. Although this version exhibits more brains the brawn, it's not enough. In an era where there are dozens of imitators spawned by the original film, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is muscled out by the competition.",1343088000,,3004,4.9880239520958085

This version of Conan follows a different story-line than the original two Schwarzenegger films.  Here, we see an origins story of Conan, from birth to childhood, to his learning how to use and forge a sword, the destruction of his family, and his pursuit of revenge.  All throughout are graphic fight scenes high on blood on low on gore.  The special effects are good, though not original.  The dialogue is plain, enough to get the ideas across but nothing inspirational.  The biggest letdown are the lack of comedy and the boring soundtrack.  The original Conan movies had a steady mix of subtle and overt humor; whether it be the camel spitting on Conan, or Conan knocking himself out on a tree.  Not this movie, Jason Momoa's Conan is just serious, as are all the other characters.  Everybody is either wanting to kill or avoid getting killed.  This film's soundtrack was also lackluster with no memorable tunes.  This is quite unlike the first two movies, which was good background music appropriate for each scene.

The sorcery was always a problem for these kinds of movies back in the 80s, and while I generally feel like CGI is overused in todays action films, in this movie it is used well.  Overall it's much better than the recent ""family friendly"" sword and sworcery films like the Clash of the Titans remake or Prince of Persia.  It's nice to see the barbarian back in R rated fighting form.",1342137600,,603,4.2631578947368425
4342760,2,B004EPYZTE,"Conan the Barbarian is a mediocre action film. The storyline is extremely generic and you've most likely seen something similar many times before.

What did I like? Conan does have some decent action scenes and a few ""wow!"" moments; I liked the sand scene a bit. It had decent acting from some of the cast. Music matched the setting.

What did I dislike? As I previously stated, it's extremely generic. The young, pretentious Conan wants to be a warrior but his father tells him he isn't ready to wield his sword yet because he doesn't think when he fights; later, his father dies and it leads to your typical revenge flick. The characters had no depth and I found most of them very annoying. Very little dialogue and background. I thought the film would be saved by the action, but there aren't any mind-blowing scenes aside from a few vicious deaths. A couple of sword fights but nothing to set it apart from others. Also, it had small things like a decapitated head blinking and a dismembered hand moving; why??

Overall, I feel a bit generous giving this film 2 stars, but it isn't the worst movie of all time. It has plenty of problems and I don't recommend paying to watch it. If you have Netflix Streaming, save your money and view it there (available as of 7/13/12).

4342763,1,B004EPYZTE,"Remakes have been happening for a good long time, partly cause the technology is better so they can have bigger sets and better special effects and also partly cause Hollywood has been running out of original ideas. So enter this remake of the 1982 Arnold swords and sorcery epic ""Conan: The Barbarian"" where a young man named Conan (Jason Momoa, HBO's ""Game of Thrones"") is born on a battlefield and is raised by his dad (Ron Perlman, ""Hellboy"") to be a great warrior.

So after going on a test with some young soon to be warriors Conan is attacked by and kills a few savages, then soon after an army of these savages and their new leader Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang, ""Avatar"") attack Conan's village and his dad ends up dead. Zym is looking for bone fragments of an ancient bone mask that if pieced back together would give the person wearing it great power.

After seeing his dad die Conan embarks on a vengeance sparked quest to avenge his father, but soon learns he must help lead the rest of the warrior nations against the bloodthirsty leader before he can reassemble the mask. There's lots of blood, fighting, more blood, a little good natured slave freeing, monsters and well you know how these type of movies go.

Initially its basic and bare bones action and dialogue, however it does quickly become quite dull and hollow even as the blood flies and the body count multiplies. Momoa is at the very least a hulking presence and makes a good action hero, even if he's little more than a meat head.

The rest of the cast includes Rachel Nichols (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra""), Rose McGowan (""Scream"") and Bob Sapp (""Elektra"" and a former K-1 competitor), so at least there's one attractive woman to gain the attention of the male viewer in between action sequences (I'd normally say two but Rose looks bizarre as Zym's daughter).

4342765,5,B004EPYZTE,"Unlike the old movies, this Conan is the original Conan, like the character in Robert E. Howard's books.  Which, in my opinion, makes this a ten times better movie than the ones that went before.  And, even that aside, it's a good action movie.

The action sequences were really well done--which is probably the most important thing for an action story.  They were visually interesting without resorting to fancy camera trick (like the Matrix).  And they didn't put in out of place Hong Kong martial arts.  I thought the first scene with Conan as a little boy was especially good.  I was really impressed with it.

There's a little humor in it, which is always good.  It's mostly dark humor, but something to keep the movie from being totally grim is always appreciated.

And, yes, there's not much dialogue.  But, that's a plus.  Conan is not a chatty character.  If there had been a lot of dialogue and 'character development' it wouldn't have been Conan, at least not Robert E. Howard's version.

I think a lot of the negative reviews of this movie are totally unfair because they criticize the film for not being like the old Conan movies.  I think that's actually the movie's strong point.  The old Conan was Arnold Schwarzenegger in a loin cloth.  Conan, the real Conan from the books, was the original anti-hero.  He's the type who conquers and kills, just because he can, but is strangely likable anyway.  I think Jason Momoa pulled that off perfectly.

I'll admit this film is not for everyone.  The fight scenes are very bloody, it's not clean cartoon violence like you see in superhero movies.  So the squeamish won't enjoy this one.

At the same time the plot is very straight-forward revenge motive and there are a lot of bits that are directly from the books which were new back then but have been used repeatedly since.  It can seem unoriginal or cliche, if you don't consider the fact that this is going back to the original template that created the cliche.  In any case, there aren't any big surprises.

My bottom-line is that there is finally an accurate and well produced version of the classic Conan stories.",1340150400,,2129,4.686486486486486

Crom was a dark deity, and one best avoided, and his name generally used as a curse...  very appropriately used in this movie as a swear.

There are a couple cheesy Hollywood moments, most notable the flipping carriage in slow-motion.  That I could have done without.  But otherwise I was quite happy with this version.  Conan looked more like a warrior than a body-builder (two very different body types, as anyone who knows much on the subject can tell you) and his overall attitude was very fitting.  The magical evil the villain harnesses is even a little tentacle-y, which given Howard's long distance friendship with HP Lovecraft is where that influence came from in his stories; Howard's 'gods' tended to be a bit on the cthonic side.

4342818,1,B004EPYZTE,"Let me begin by saying that I am a die-hard fan of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories, novellas, and novel. This film lacked most of what I enjoy in those stories -- the wit, the suspense, the great dialogue, the panache. It has been replaced on the screen with fairly uninteresting CGI battles and a great deal of grunting in place of dialogue. I think the moment that most captured this for me was when the movie touched on Conan's famous carpe diem speech: ""Let me live deep while I live. Let me enjoy the sting of red wine on my palate, the embrace of white arms, ... I live, I burn with life, I slay, I am content."" The movie reduced that to a very brief one-liner so insipid I can't even recall it.

The villains are uninspiring. The setup for the heroine had potential but they didn't really do anything interesting afterward, nor even give her any good lines...

I think what irks me is this: Robert E. Howard, whether you love his work or loathe it, is excellent at writing compelling pulp. He does fast-paced, entertaining plots. He comes up with intriguing bad guys and intriguing monsters. When he's writing his better work and not shlock, he also produces memorable women in the supporting roles -- Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, Belit of the Black Coast. In other words, his fiction hands Hollywood action movie fodder on a silver platter. Yet against all logic, Hollywood entirely fails to do anything compelling with it. It's completely without excuse.

Forgive me if this review proves not particularly detailed or useful, but I am just too irritated. I didn't have high expectations for the film (though I had hopes), but it hit so low beneath even the expectations I did have that I am ... just irritated.

To give the film its due, two strong points:
* Conan actually LOOKS like Conan. The ""dark-haired, sullen-eyed,"" etc. -- they got that.
* The first 20 minutes are good storytelling. The backstory in Cimmeria, the Picts ... not brilliant, but very well done.

4342822,3,B004EPYZTE,"I just watched this on the Epix Movie Channel in HD.  I was really looking forward to seeing this as I missed it at the theaters and on DVD release.  As I sat down with my dinner and flipped the channel on I had high hopes that once again I would be transported to Hyboria.

Well...I wasn't.  I'm not sure where I was transported to, but it wasn't Hyboria.  Let me say first off that the Arnold incarnation of Conan was not perfect either, but it was still loved and rewatched numerous times by us action lovers.  It, dispite it flaws, was a GOOD movie and had the perfect lead.  This new 2011 'Conan' is not a rewatch.

--Story--**(Some Spoilers)**

The movie begins by showing an ancient group of Necromancers doing some sort of occult ritual.  The flaw in the scene is that you see nothing happening.  There is a mask, (which is the MAIN plot point in the film), that these Necromancers made that was supposed to grant GREAT power to the wearer.  Well...the Necromancers are defeated by the barbarian tribes and the mask broken up into little pieces and spread amoung the tribal heads for safe-keeping.

This is flaw one.  If this mask is so evil, they should have just beat the @#$& out of it and turned it into dust.  Why allow the possibility of it being used again in the future???

The movie flashes ahead to little Conan, still an infant inside his mother.  We see a sword get thrush into his mother and just miss the baby.  Conan's father (Ron Pearlman) cuts Conan out and let's the mother see the infant before dying.  This scene is extremely unrealistic.  But this violant birth on a battle field gives Conan the title/statis of ""Battle Born.""  This is alluded to as one reason he is so well equipped at fighting.

As mentioned earlier the main focus of this film is the Necronmancer Mask.  I guess the mask allows the user to bring back the dead.  That's all the villan Khalar Zym, (Stephen Lang, the bad guy from 'Avatar'), talks about the whole film.  It is his desire to resurrect his witch-wife and have her use her increased powers to inslave the world for him.  His wife was burned at the stake, shown in a flash back scene.

Khalar Zym destroys Conan's village, kills Conan's father (or at least sets him up to die...) and leaves Conan furious, and this sets him on his bloody path.

This is flaw two.  Arnold's Conan was shown at various stages in his life.  Once he was grown, we witness him as a slave on the Mill of Agony, as a gladiator, once he is set free he discovers the cave of Grom and gets that cool sword.  Then he's a thief for a while before being hired by a king to rescue the kingdom's princess from James Earl Jones.  My point is we see Conan doing a lot of things, just like in the books.

Unfortunately we just go from child Conan to Jason Momoa.  No scenes of his struggles or escapades.  We are just thrust to the future and see him freeing slaves.  No backstory what-so-ever.  Thus the viewer doesn't really grow attached to the character, nor do we really care about him in the film...ever.

Conan later on rescues a red-haired woman, (Scarlet from 'G. I. Joe'), and spends the rest of the movie saving/protecting her.  For some reason her blood is important.  As this is all Rose McGowan talks about endlessly...

I won't give anymore plot points away.  This is the jist of the movie.  Nothing too deep or interesting.

--Character Choices--

Jason Momoa as Conan was wrong for one reason.  He's not big enough.  You can't go from an Austrian body-builder to a surfer.  Granted he did bulk up for this film, he still lacked the physique of a Cimmerian warrior, in my opinion.  In Momoa's defense, it is evident that he gave this movie 100 percent.  It still though wasn't enough.  The film not being stellar is also not ALL his fault.  Bad writing, bad casting decisions, THEN Momoa are what took this film down.  Momoa was GREAT in 'Stargate: Atlantis', but not great as Conan.  I personally think he had TOO much dialogue.  Arnold's character did not speak much in the first film, and I think it was a PLUS for the character.  Conan does not strike me as chatty.  Momoa's Conan was too chatty.  This was probably again though due to BAD WRITING.

Stephen Lang while a great villian in 'Avatar', does not deliver in this.  He looked too old, and had a WAY too close relationship with his daughter.  Any minute I thought they were going to get it on, and I would puke.  He is ruthless in the film, having a TONS of people slaughtered whenever he feels the urge.  He has no reason for killing in my opinion, it's always for this stupid mask or something related to it.  FYI, when he finally does get the mask ensembled and puts the ""pure blood"" in it, all that happens is that is wriggles around like a starfish.  He puts it on his face and it wraps itself around making a helmet.  That's it.

Rose McGowan, while good as Cherry from 'Planet Terror', was not good as Khalar Zym's witch daughter.  She played a witch on 'Charmed', and must have been good, as the show was on FOREVER.  However in 'Conan' she never displays any powers.  She does once make some dust people that Conan fights for 5 minutes.  Other than that, besides sniffing all the time for the ""pure blood"" like Wolverine, she demonstrates no witch powers.  She looks out of place in the film, and does not pull off the look of a Hyborian Witch.  Plus her scenes where she is coming on to her father are pretty gross.

I couldn't tell you much about the rest of the characters, as I said you never get attached to anyone in the film.  Ron Pearlman is in the movie, and does an OKAY job as Conan's father.  The red haired woman who played Scarlet in 'G. I. Joe' is the woman Conan is always protecting.  She does not add anything to movie acting wise.  The french guy from 'G. I. Joe' is here also, he's the guy with an eye patch, the thief who helps Conan.  He's actually pretty good.

--Wrapping up--

Bad casting choices and terrible writing killed this film.  If you were one of the few who LOVED this movie, don't expect a sequel.  This movie is evidence that sometimes a franchise is better left alone.  Revisiting a movie franchise with new actors and writers usually doesn't equal success.  Will the new 'Total Recall' be a disaster???  Time will tell, one things for certain, the original wasn't broken in any way.  Why do we need a remake???

Well, that's my 2 cents worth and opinions on this new 'Conan'.  Is is worth buying, NO.  Watch it on tv, it will be on FX really soon I'm sure...",1335830400,3,6508,4.412310286677909

The problem is that this new guy looks like a ""model"" and isn't believable to have lived the life of conan..  He's too much ""pretty/prissy boy""

Also, i don't like how flexible and agile he is.. too ""nimble"" for a Conan

The Conan i want to see should be a massive tank.. that just hulks his way through mountains of enemies like a bulldozer, using shear brute force.

We need someone that looks like they could be a linebacker on a football team..  someone that is even a bit ugly so that they seem like they have had a tough life to become Conan.

Think ""Clingon Warrior"".. only more human.. and you have a conan.

Pick someone missing a few teeth and an ugly mug with scars and you'd have a more believable conan than the one we see in this flick.",1334880000,2,834,4.227848101265823

4342826,3,B004EPYZTE,"Life isn't easy when you are so weighted down with bulging muscles and sheer enthusiasm that it's hard to find your place in the world. But it helps when you have vengeance driving you.

Even though they are Barbarians, they are not untouchable. That is the hard lesson that young Conan learns when a foreign army invades his village, slaughters the people, and leaves him to die right alongside his father. Up until then he had a decent life. It was hard and full of bloodshed and loss, but his dad was teaching him the finer points of swordsmanship and how to be a decent warrior. But in that moment everything changed. Khalar (Stephen Lang) is after only one thing: the missing pieces to a mythical mask that gives its wearer the power of necromancy. It seems that the local do-gooders killed his sorceress wife and he wants her back again, so she can bring an underworld army with her and make him the most powerful thug on the face of the earth. But in order to activate the mask, he needs the blood of someone from one of the original necromancer bloodlines.

Twenty years later, he is still seeking her out, along with his sorceress daughter Marique (Rose McGowen). But Conan (Jason Momoa) has grown up in the meantime with a grudge nearly as big as his muscles. He wants revenge for the death of his father and the destruction of his village. And if he has to kidnap the beautiful Tamara (Rachel Nichols), the last of the ancient bloodline, to do it, he will. This leads to a confrontation of sorcery and necromancy as the two enemies are pitted against one another in a battle that is both personal and otherwise. Overall, the movie isn't awful but it isn't magnificent either. It falls somewhere in the middle, hampered by the frequent gore and absurd departures from rational characterization. (Why would a pure little ""monk"" like Tamara get down and dirty for a night with Conan, and then return to her chaste monastery as if nothing had happened? And why would Marique take her on in a closed space and not use magic?) But the music is stirring and the performances are good. It is even a halfway decent plot with good visuals to fill in the gaps.

But that's when we get to the real problems here -- for me, maybe as a woman and maybe merely as a viewer, the film dragged in places, particularly when it was just Conan doing battle with sandmen, or a giant octopus-like creature, or simply a bad guy in the dungeons. It picked up the pace whenever Tamara was around but the downside is that in showcasing how cool Conan is, they kind of ignored the much more interesting characters -- like Marique, the stuff of Barbarian nightmares. This film is also simply beautiful to look at, with lush, rich surroundings that range from panoramic daylight to the dank underground. And I loved the costuming; it isn't much to look at for the first half, but when we get into the female priestesses and ceremonial robes, it's gorgeous.

Inspired by the earlier film in the same vein, one does not expect epic writing brilliance from Conan the Barbarian. One expects gorgeous women in distress, oiled muscles glinting in the sunlight, blood spraying in all directions, and some good old fashioned sorcery -- and that is pretty much what one gets. There were moments I really enjoyed, moments where I was bored, moments that disgusted me, and moments in which I wished it had simply been better. Because the potential was there, it just got kind of sidetracked in its desire to be a formulaic success.",1332892800,,3500,4.604166666666667

(they broke my heart) this will be quite different, this is much more bloody and without the cheesy humor and sidekicks some people must have loved (and I hated, Conan wasn't funny and didn't have a goofy Asian wizard pals). But if you've actually read Robert E. Howard's (1906-1936) Conan stories, it's a whole lot closer then Arnold's stumbling fool. It's odd, the quote people made fun of ""I live, I love, I slay -- I am content""... is actually right out of the books.
I think the fault of this movie was trying to incorporate some of the Arnold Schwarzenegger films story line into it. The whole vengeance on the people who killed his family has nothing to do with Robert E. Howard's Conan, the same with the riddle of steel stuff. Also, why is he in a dress? And what's with the obviously silly swords, (two blades?) while not as bad as the helmet worn by Mickey Rourke in The Immortals, or Russell Crowe's chrome job in Gladiator... it's obvious the designers wanted something new and cool, but stood out as ""simply wrong"".

I don't think we are so illiterate and so non-talkative as to not be able to follow dialogue. The show would have been much more interesting and entertaining had there been about four times as much speaking in it. The original Conan the Barbarian movie had lots of talking - adventurers telling their tales, the high priest working his deceptive charm and rhetoric on his acolytes, gathered crowds and even Conan himself. We people like talking and listening, particularly if the dialogue is epic, exotic, and makes you ponder deeply on the unsolvable mysteries of life. There is plenty of wholesome stuff heroes, princesses and priests can say - the writers can look up stuff from philosophers. The original movie was based on Nietzsche's philosophy of ""What does not kill us makes us stronger"" and was a pretty deep look into the meaning of life, Conan representing the Ubermensche (the ""Overman."") Hollywood writers are highly educated in the classics and Shakespeare (even this movie is basically a mesh of the Odyssey, Iliad and Lord of the Rings) so I don't see why they can't bring more of their tremendous education to bear on filling out the dialogue with more interesting things than the occasional ""behold!"" and barbarian grunts.

4342977,5,B004EPYZTE,"Conan the Barbarian (2011)

I didn't watch this in the cinemas because I was not at all impressed with the previews and trailers. Watched it in regular DVD today. I actually liked it. There is good reason why.

This one has no connection nor shared mythology with the wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of the 80s - this one is a good followup though it failed to reboot the franchise at the box office. It is a good pulp action movie. Everything you would expect from a costume-sword-sorcery-legend. I didn't like the first few minutes with the narration, they should have worked it into the plot. But I guess if they did that, they would have to make long drawn out boring trilogy like The Lord of the Rings which is still not as worse as the boring snoozefest written by Tolkien. But after that brief narration, when this movie starts, it starts in amazing style and drama. You have to watch it to realise it.

This is an engaging remake of the original Conan the Barbarian movies. Much better production of course, thanks to improvement in technology and design. I don't understand the criticisms of this movie. Sure, it is a predictable pulp fiction plot. But that is why I am watching it, no? A real pulp no-holds-barred thrill.

The pace is good. The story doesn't rush forward. It unfolds its plot well. The action is on a grand scale. Real war. Million times better than watching a bunch of dwarf kids running around with a magical ring in Middle Earth. Conan rises. He is the prodigal son born out of war and death. His father raises him under due discipline. But Conan has wild barbarian blood in him. The child actor playing the young Conan, Leo Howard is brilliant. He does a good job showing the cold-blooded brutality and harsh reality of a savage world of an ancient era. The man playing his father is also a very good character actor here. The son grows up alone and he seeks revenge. He slays and pillages and loots. He has comrades. But the man he seeks, he shall fight him alone. This raw energy is well portrayed by the actor Jason Momoa. He is a fresh change from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course the image of Arnold as Conan the Barbarian shall be imprinted on our minds forever. But see this movie as a new one, a fresh narration. Actor Jason Momoa is an athletic, intelligent and impressive man, not the bulging angry hulk that Arnold portrayed. Jason Momoa is also quite handsome and delivers his lines well with good amount of emotion and strength in his voice. That dialogue delivery alone takes him up a few notches to match up with the legend that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a more realistic depiction of an ancient warrior.

During the making of the Arnold version of Conan, many scenes were cut on the editing table because of graphic violence. This 2011 version doesn't suffer that fate. Here the savagery is naked and startling. But the Arnold version was true to the sword and sorcery genre. This 2011 remake is more mainstream and seeks more ""realistic"" depiction of ancient warfare, chaos and belief systems. I like both. I can't pick one over the other. Both as they stand alone are beautifully made and well directed. The 2011 version is in epic proportions, a lot more money having been spent on making this one. The cinematography and lighting is very complimentary to the storyline as it progresses.

Jason Momoa is a great find. I haven't seen any other movies of his. I would like to. I hope his career isn't affected by the boxoffice results of this Conan adventure. He has great potential as an action hero in any type of movie, period or modern. His talent shines here and carries the movie on his broad scarred shoulders as he rampages against an evil warlord. He is one good reason to go watch this movie. The other is the costumes. It is not overdone like in Gladiator or The Lord of the Rings. Here the costume doesn't steal the limelight and attention from the actors playing their vicious roles. In Conan 2011, the costumes blend in and become an essential accessory of the storyline. We don't get distracted. It just makes everything more real.

The franchise has a real chance of surviving. It needs better brand management among other things. Such as a whole new storyline, updating the ancient Robert E. Howard texts by making it more attractive to modern day sword-sorcery-fantasy fans. This would mean a real reboot of the series. There is so much that can be done. I hope a serious director takes up this project in the near future and rebuilds it as it deserves to.

The sets and location of Conan 2011 is spectacular. It overshadows any compliment you could give to the 1982 movie. The climax especially is in epic proportions and righly so. Lot of good work has gone into this movie and this is apparent as it progresses through the second half.

Among other memorable characters, there is a real talent in the actress playing the evil daughter-witch - Rose McGowan. She exudes evil and she lives it in the role of Marique. Stunning! The other villains also steal the show. They are more memorable than say Conan's allies such as his pirate-friend or the master-thief. Stephen Lang does justice to his role as a warlord. He is not overtly evil. He is patient and wise and calculating. Well portrayed to bring a worthy adversary to Conan. And of course there is the incredibly recognisable and impressive narrative voice of Morgan Freeman retelling the legend of Conan.

Actually, the movie needed better marketing effort. I now wish I had seen this on the big silver screen in 3D as it was meant to be. Never mind! Watch it, you won't be disappointed - it is a entertainer and awe-inspiring effort too. I am giving this 5 stars. The Oscar winners don't know what fun they are missing!

Those who are complaining about this movie saying it is a travesty or saying that they liked the 1982 film but this one is horrible - you know, these are the same people who would have given bad reviews to the 1982 film if we were living in 1982.

My take is that Schwarzenegger's Conan was great, and a lot of fun, even if the critics ridiculed it at the time.  Momoa's Conan isn't the same a Schwarzenegger's, but it's also great, and also a lot of fun.  Everyone involved with this movie was a real fan, and they put their hearts into it.

It has been years since I saw the 1982 version with Arnold Schwarzenegger, so when I saw the previews for this version, I thought it would be a decent reboot. The movie has some great visual effects and set designs and the cinematography isn't bad. You really get the sense that this is the world of Hyborea that Robert E. Howard wrote about and not just some desert. The visuals are the best thing about the movie.

The acting in the movie is flat. There's just no life to the characters. Jason Momoa tries, but he's really not given much terms of dialogue. Schwarzenegger didn't have a ton to say in the 1982 movie, but I think he had better dialogue than Momoa's Conan does. Not only that, but Arnold's Conan had a ton more personality than Momoa's version. Stephen Lang has the best role as the villain Zym. In fact, he's about the only character in the whole movie that has any life to him whatsoever. There's lots of blood and some nudity, but it doesn't mean anything because the story is so lackluster and the characters are so lifeless.

The movie isn't a complete waste, but it could have been so much more. In short, if you are a fan of Howard's novels or the character of Conan, you will probably want to watch the movie. Action fans will probably be split on whether they like it or not. Though I didn't think it was terrible, I actually prefer the 1982 version.",1327968000,,2677,4.459183673469388

The movie got such bad press before it was released it was doomed from the beginning.
This is strictly a movie for what some people consider mindless violence (the sword and sorcery adventure, long on sword).
The production values were better than expected, the plot was coherent and the actors played their parts. It was fast paced and I had fun cheering for the 'good' guy whose moral compass is stuck on revenge.

4343106,3,B004EPYZTE,"I enjoyed this film when I saw it in the cinema, and I've enjoyed it the couple of times I've seen it since on DVD. That said, it ain't as good as the original with Arnie!

Jason Momoa is an excellent Conan and brings him to life in a very different way to Arnie's. Momoa's Conan gets more out of the character, his charm, his brutality and his roguishness. Arnie's Conan is rather enigmatic. A lot of the time, stuff is happening to him, rather than him making stuff happening. For example, he doesn't escape his slavery, he is released. Momoa's Conan would have bust his way out and killed every one of his oppressors.

The beginning is perhaps the best part of the 2011 version. The egg chase is very well done (similar to the one in Rapanui)and the battle with Kalar Zym's army is well handled too. However, the 80's version somehow did it better, with less guys and less effects. The middle of the film is ok as well, and its good to see Conan aboard a pirate ship, as per the Howard yarns. It's the end of the movie where it comes a bit unstuck and leaves you unsatisfied.

The 80s version had that fantastic bloodbath battle at the standing stones, and Conan's 'Da hell wid you!' speech to Crom. This one has a lot of scrappy swordfights in tunnels with the main villains. Where did their armies go? The villain's pay off is weak too. Having achieved his magical ambition, he never gets to flex his muscles, raise a zombie army, call up a horrible demon, any of that stuff. Which is a pity.

Design wise, the 2011 version is very nice, but not as good (sigh) as the 1980s version. John Milius spent a lot of time trying to get the 'historicity' of Hyborea right, and he achieved it very well. I couldn't help but miss Arnie's standing stones battle armour, which had just the right look to it. In a way, I think that all the action sequences in this film should have happened in reverse order, small fight to large battle, still with a tentacled beastie in the middle.

Hopefully all the crappy reviews this film has received won't prevent more films of this nature being made, but I suspect it may, at least for the present. Then again, Clash of the Titans got smashed and that got a sequel.",1326758400,,2199,4.379901960784314
4343107,1,B004EPYZTE,"Having grown up with the Arnold version of Conan, as well as the comics, I had high expectations from this movie, given that it's about 30 years later.  The original not only had Arnold, but James Earl Jones as the enemy.  Now while Jason Momoa looked the part, his voice didn't match the character.  I expected not only a slightly deeper voice (like the one he uses in Game of Thrones) but, I don't know, MAYBE an accent?  Also speak a little slower, it's not a race to finish your lines.  Maybe knowing how badly the movie was going to turn out, they felt they had to get through their lines fast in order to get out of there.
And the people who watched it before release...you were OK with it??
I'd avoid buying this movie and just rent it if you want to watch it....or better yet rent the Arnold versions.  This only succeeded in making me want to watch those older movies anyway.",1326672000,2,884,4.327272727272727

I read all the Conan books growing up, and this is the Conan that should have been.  It better captured his personality, as a rogue, that's fair, cunning, and relentless.  It doesn't show him to be ""nice"", but not a ""bully"".  It makes him interesting and likable, with a little more depth than punching a camel.  Conan wasn't supposed to be HUGE, but large, and athletic looking.  He was supposed to have black hair.  They still didn't give him blue eyes, but it can be forgiven.  The ""bad guys"" were quite appropriate for the setting, and fairly well done.  I don't feel that the weapons were grossly over-sized like I saw another reviewer say, but they weren't ""authentically"" sized.  This is a fantasy piece- while I suppose they could be more ""realistic"", I don't see that as being necessary, when you have necromancers and monsters in the story...

The special effects are good but Momoa is a terrible Conan. How much does he weigh? 180 lbs.? Hardly fit to be a Cimmerian. And he's not a good actor either.

The plot needed more depth and overall it was a complete departure from the books, and that's unfortunate because the books would make a good movie if they stuck to one of the stories. Marique the Sorceress (Rose McGowan) is the only reason I didn't give this movie one star. She played the best role. Other than that this movie was a waste of 112 mins, and an even bigger waste to those who produced it, as it flopped.",1326585600,2,699,4.102189781021898
4343111,3,B004EPYZTE,"You can't really accuse Marcus Nispel's swords and sorcery fantasy of being namby-pamby - there's cracked skulls and slashed limbs a plenty - and enough ketchup to worry Burger King. We're not exactly talking Conan The ""Librarian"" here. And yet somehow - and despite Herculean effort (if you'll forgive the terrible pun) - it just doesn't click.

It should though. All the right ingredients for an update of this comic-book hero are there - bad guys with bad teeth - a minion with a severed nose and a tasty set of thumb-screws - an evil witch sporting razors for nail extensions - exotic wenches sporting very little else... And all the while a longhaired body-builder does his best to act while wielding a sword of destiny, riding a horse through haunted forests, causing landslides in slave mines, sneaking through secret passages into a turreted castle of ultimate doom (you know the sort) - and even finding time to shag a monastic nubile in a mud hut with very fetching candlelight. Not to mention all manner of burly warriors with more facial battle scars than members of the Scunthorpe Debate Society after a particularly rough game of Cribbage.

To be fair to the lead actor on which pretty much everything rests - it's hard to follow in the triceps of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But Jason Momoa as Conan The Barbarian is likeable and a very credible presence on screen (he clearly bought a Bullworker in the last few months as well). Stephan Lang (of ""Avatar"" fame) is the main villain - a power-obsessed overlord trying to get an ancient mask back that will make him a God (I felt the same way last week when I was queuing in Tescos). He thoroughly enjoys a psychotic frown as he pokes your eyes out and regularly rabbits on about ""...rivers of blood..."" and other such delightful bedside chatter (dialogue above). There are loads of battle sequences to keep the action ante up and the BLU RAY picture quality is immaculate throughout (it comes as a 'Double Play' set and there's a '3D' version too). There's even a believable 'attraction' between Jason Momoa and the gorgeous Rachel Nichols as Tamara the 'pure blood'. There's also the ever-watchable Ron Perlman as Corin (Conan's father) and Nonso Anozie plays Conan's loyal sidekick Artus - a man with Byzantine dreadlocks and personal hygiene issues.

And yet this new remake grows tiresome very quickly - rather like ""The Prince Of Persia"" did. I think the main culprit is the incredibly derivative storyline - we've seen and heard all of this epic warrior and his journey nonsense before - and way too many times too. A boy witnesses his father and entire village be slaughtered - grows up to be a fierce warrior - systematically avenges all involved - meets fab-looking dolly bird en-route - saves the world from the forces of darkness - returns to a nicer mud hut at the end - has a shower (wash the blood and entrails off) - and settles in with a nice cup of cocoa and the Downton Abbey Christmas special. It sounds like great fun - it sounds rip-roaring - and at times it is. But it also feels a little empty-headed somehow. It's hard to get excited about this - and I'd admit to fast forwarding on more than one occasion. I also doubt I'd want to watch it again - so it's a rental rather than a purchase.

Still - if you're up for a bit of a He-Man actioner - you could do worse - you could try Poker night at the Scunthorpe Debate Society...",1326326400,,3410,4.612850082372323

Add in the talented Stephen Lang as Conan's nemisis, Khalar Zym, and Rachel Nichols as Tamara, Conan's love interest, this should have been much better.

No plot spoilers from me: The movie follows Conan from his birth, to his youth learning about what is to be a Sumerian and becoming a man, to the destruction of his village, and his long search for revenge. This sounds a lot like the original 1982 movie, but the implementation was far from as entertaining.

The action, settings, and special effects were all top rate and are what made this a watchable movie, but the lack of character development and generally weak script were the real let down.

The real test of any movie is how often you can rewatch it and I watch the 1982 version once or twice a year, but will likely not go out of my way to see this one again.

There are a few missed opportunities to really make the characters shine such as delving more into the heroin and the prophecy she is part of as well as the relationship between the two main ""evil"" characters.

But the gentleman playing conan does a very good job. There's action, sorcery, monsters and a really good nice sequence when conan is a boy.

The very start of the movie is a bit over the top and silly. By this I mean, having the camera go ""inside"" the mother showing the baby sort of takes one out of the murky fantasy world we will be plummeted into. In addition the birth of conan seems more like B movie fair as it's quite over the top.

Another missed opportunity is the thief sidekick who is not much of a side kick. He almost seems included in the movie as a plot device and we could have easily had more of him. If anything it would have added a lightness that would be very welcome. Instead he just exists so that he can be called upon later in the movie to do ""one thing"".

However, in spite of this and in spite of the movie feeling like the end was rushed, I really liked it in a sort of B movie way and I recommend it to people who want a fun, well made (as far as production values) fantasy movie. I gave the movie three stars though my enjoyment was more like four stars because of the ""fun factor"". Still, when put under the microscope it is, to me, a three star movie at best. There are plot holes, characters are not fleshed out well enough, even for a Conan movie, And sometimes things don't flow well.

Conan's relationship with his father has more depth and the special effects, of course, are better than the older movie but that's no surprise. That said, the villain of the old one was a lot better, so was the love interest and the overall story and flow is better, too. Oh, and the music score of the old Conan is better as well.

4343503,1,B004EPYZTE,"This movie was awful... Really, I wish I could say something good about it, I saw it twice to try and find something redeeming, but the cold fact is there isn't anything. Begrudgingly, I must list what's wrong with it.

1. Who is Conan and why do we care?

The movie starts out with some stupid action scene where we're shown how awesome little kid Conan is, after being shown that he is the classic runt of the group. This is conflicting storytelling, but I won't split hairs. We then go into a training sequence where we are shown Conan's one character flaw: his temper. This isn't really important because it's never really brought up as a problem in the rest of the movie. The nice thing about a character flaws i that it not only gives the main character something to overcome, but it also gives the audience a way of connecting with the character. If this element is absent, it makes the story foreign to a real audience, and ultimately uninteresting.

After the village no one in the audience cares about is attacked, this bad guy gets the final piece of a mask that's powerful, I guess. The father sacrifices his life for Conan, which is as close to touching as you can get in this movie. After that Conan is basically a grown up. He has a group of people with him and he hates slave traders for some reason that's never explained. We, the audience have no idea why adult Conan is who he is. He's just some guy who fights people.

2. Booooooobs

There are a lot of boobs in this movie, and the actors they belong to have the acting integrity of bad porn stars. The most notable boobs.... I mean actress of this bunch is our leading lady, Ms. Idontcareabouthername shewontbefamousanyway. Playing Conan's romantic opposite, they're romantic element to the movie goes like this: Conan kidnaps her, kills people in front of her, tells her she looks like a whore, and suddenly she loves him. You may be thinking that I'm skipping over a huge element of their relationship, but the sad thing is I'm really not; that's as deep as it goes.

3. Oh Jesus.... The tower....

So of all of the plot holes in this train wreck they call a movie, by far the most obvious and horrible is the tower scene. In order to save his lady love, Conan the horrible actor... I mean Barbarian... must break into the tower of the evil guy. So with the help of a pointless character, he finds a pretty exposed door leading into a dungeon, for some reason. Suddenly the find themselves wading through water that seems to be about 4 feet deep. Despite this, this shallow water holds an octopus monster that is huge. The two are dragged underwater at one point and the 4 feet suddenly are 20... I don't think I can make the problem any more obvious than that. So after kind of fighting this monster(Conan just kinda swings his sword a little) they suddenly find themselves at the top of this tower. That's right, the octopus was the only thing guarding the place. At the top of the tower Conan and the other guy look down to see Conan's lady being dragged across an extremely exposed area, right next to the sea. Then he says that he'd better get down there... Okay, so climbing the tower was pointless? Not only was it unnecessary,  but apparently he can get to the bottom just like that?! I was pretty much done with this movie right about at the tower of pointlessness.

But I continued to watch...

4. The mask that does.... Um... Something....

The mask of terrible power turns out to be a mask of terribly boring power. The bad guy puts it on and runs around going ""Yarg!"" until Conan kills him. That's about all I need to say.

5. The ending.

Literary study lesson for any idiot who liked this movie: When a writer forms a story, he/she is engaging in a contract with their audience. In order to have a satisfying story, you must tie up the loose ends, and give a conclusion that is of an equal value to the struggle your main character has been put through. Ask a professor of literature if you don't believe me. In the end, Conan, doesn't get the girl, no longer has a gang of rag tag rapscallions, and hasn't really learned anything. There isn't really any reason for this, either. He chooses to be alone, and the movie ends with him standing in the ruins of his village. If I didn't think the movie had a point before seeing this scene, the ending confirms how pointless the plot is. I would say this is a spoiler, but I think the movie spoils itself well enough on its own.

""But Blair, I'm only going to this movie for the action...""

Sorry, little Jimmy. The action is just as mindnumbingly pointless as the rest of the film.

There is really nothing good about this movie.

It's better than the Arnold 80's version for sure.",1324080000,,311,4.421052631578948
4343507,1,B004EPYZTE,"Yeah, and the producers/writers/director/whomever clearly do not understand the character or stories of Conan hence they do not wield it effectively. As a Sword & Sorcery film it was okay, at best. As a Conan story it was terrible. As with the Milius version we get yet another sentimental version of the character. Conan was many things in his fictional career, indeed he has been a thief, pirate, military and mercenary Captain, even a desert chieftain and finally King. But sentimental? Nope, sorry. Given my experience of reading the character I feel Conan would view sentimentality as a weakness.

I knew something was wrong during the narrative intro by an oddly misplaced Morgan Freeman voiceover (the first time I didn't like him in something). The voice over started off correctly but then deviated wildly from the history of Hyborea. Conan is made to stand out as something special, unique and somehow important. This time he is gifted with near superhuman skills and abilities which takes away from the excitement as you never feel like Conan is ever in danger of actually losing (even though you know he won't) let alone getting injured or suffering. The written character of Conan was not unique, different or special. He actually was an outsider and his father and exile. At fifteen he (for the most part) ran away and eventually sought his fortunes farther south. Conan, at its heart is an everyman tale (if an arrogant everyman). He is not heroic, although his actions could surely often be interpreted as such but more often than not was seeking to better his lot while furthering his ambitions. Mostly he was just a man that kept growing, surviving and gaining skill all though his life until he achieved his goals in Aquilonia and even then had some more adventures. This, to me anyway, makes for a much more identifiable and interesting character.

A note on comparisons versus the 1982 Milius version: Neither of the films are very good Conan films but Milius' worked so much better as a Sword & Sorcery film for various reasons. One being that Conan in that film actually suffered more than once and was in no way superhuman. This one seemed to lack a sense of continuity and I felt like I was simply being dragged from one set piece to the next with little time to reflect on anything. Heck, even the sex scene seemed like a set piece.

A note regarding Jason Momoa: I do think he COULD make a good Conan but I do not think he made a very good one here. Not sure if this was his or the director's fault but running through a film constantly looking angry really makes for a bland hero. Even Arnie got to show a wide range of facial emotions in the Milius version. It may seem like a small detail but it does go a long way to humanizing the character.

Cast notes: Stephen Lang was good as a bad guy. Much more complete a character than Avatar (where he played a pretty one dimensional soldier) and overlooked by Hollywood for too long.

Ron Perlman: Please, I would watch Ron Perlman sitting alone in a room for two hours. He makes EVERYTHING he is in, better.

Rose McGowan, initially, I didn't like her in this, she was weird, creepy and disturbing. But then I realized that is EXACTLY the kind of bad guy witch woman I would want in a Sword & Sorcery flick. I have changed my stance on her and liked her in this film.

Rachel Nichols: Not really needed here. Not that I disliked her, just didn't care for her character and she seemed little more than the ""love interest contrivance"" for the script. Still, with that bit of a part, I admit she did exude charisma.

A few more notes: The filmmakers apparently pulled from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Yet, the story is VERY similar both in plot and theme to the 1982 one. What the what? Comics and images? There seems to be this major disconnect between what a comic is and how it is interpreted by Hollywood in general. A comic does NOT show the moments in-between, this is something our brains do and it is called closure. Movies rarely have that luxury as they are moving pictures and the in-between (at least within those moments) is laid out for us. Hollywood, in general, clearly does NOT understand what a comic book is. Also, many of the SSoC were based off of L. Sprague DeCamp and Lin Carter stories. What about the guy that created Conan? Remember him? Robert E. Howard. Does his original work have so little merit or influence despite being the actual creator!?! I would argue that the original literary work from Howard (or DeCamp or Carter for that matter) had much influence at all.

Final note: Ultimately I was bored watching this film. So much so I had trouble even watching the third act, compounded by the fact that it was the worst of the three. (Stephen Lang did make a great villain though) What did that mask actually do for Khalar Zym anyway? It sure didn't help him fight any better or survive.

Ultimately a let down and Conan the Destroyer (for ALL of it's faults) still remains the closest to an actual Conan film (if seemingly based on a later Carpenter or Jordan novel) despite its campy tone.",1323993600,39,5189,4.581896551724138

Morgan Freeman's narration in my opinion was awful and lacked passion. Just hearing his voice seemed as a gimic to make people believe that this movie was going to be good just because Morgan Freeman had lines within it.

The acting isn't horrible in my opinion but it wasn't decent either. The actors didn't have much dialogue or substance to work with in the first place.

The action is there just for action. A lot of it is random and only seems to take place, to well for a lack of a better term; to have it.

Costumes were badass and the character of Conan did seem Conan-ish.

I may look down on the cheesy dialogue and rightfully so, but, so for the most part is the dialogue in the Robert E Howard stories. But as a series of pulp short stories it's tolerated and is perfectly fine. As a movie it's ridiculous and cheesy.

I prefer the original because it was done as if Conan did really exist within our own history of on Earth, as REH intended in his writings.

This movie seemed to pander to the people who hated the original because in their opinion it didn't follow the REH writings to a T. This movie did feel more like it was taking from the pages of novels and comics and that just doesn't translate well to the silver screen.",1323907200,2,1488,4.389090909090909

Here it comes; I liked the old version better with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Earl Jones. Yeah the special effects were not as good and Arnold's kind of a cheesy actor but it was just better. I can still see a young Conan pushing the giant grain mill stone with dozens of other older men and 20 years later he was pushing it by himself and the man ready to become the warrior. Jason Momoa tried his best but he is just not Arnold. Maybe I was younger and more impressionable when I watched Conan the first time. I am spoiled by all of the great special effects in today's movies and so I was looking for something special after waiting for 29 years for the remake.

This time around, Jason Momoa plays the titular warrior, who is born in the heat of battle and trained as a warrior until his entire family is slaughtered by an evil warlord named Khalar Zym in search of pieces to a mystical mask. Conan escapes the onslaught and lives on as a pirate until a chance meeting provides him with a new lead to seek vengeance for his clan's extermination.

As a teen he is forced to watch the execution of his father (Ron Perlman), so of course he is out for revenge.  That's pretty much it.  The head bad guy and wannabe god is played with gusto by Stephen Lang (""Avatar"", TV's ""Terre Nova"").  Lang's more recent tough guy characters are a long way from his role as a milk-toast tabloid reporter in ""Manhunter.""  Of course there is a hottie who Khalar (Lang) is after.  Something about being a pure blood that completes the magical spell to raise his wife from the dead.  Tamara  is played woodenly by Rachel Nichols.  Yes, of course she also is spunky and spars with Conan before they get real friendly.  Still, there is no chemistry between them so we don't really care much.  The best thing about the film other than the ""Topless Wenches"" (so credited at the end) may be an eyebrowless Marique (Rose McGowan), the witchy daughter of Khalar.  She gives even old dad pause.

Seriously, no one thought this was going to be a huge blockbuster right? This is the origin story of a boy who witnesses his clan be decimated by another clan led by a man who wants to resurrect his sorceress wife. And when Ron Pearlman is your dad, you know you've reached that level of barbarianism. Conan learns, years later, that this man is still alive, and sets off on a revenge journey.

Could there be any salvation by having Stephen Lang foil mighty Conan? Not so much. While he's almost unrecognizable, he's regulated to being the prototypical goofy villain who spouts out meaningless garbage.

There is absolutely nothing of value to this movie. I suppose it attempts to stay close to the heart of the Conan books but the transition fell short.

The first five minutes was obnoxiously bad, so much so that I didn't watch anything else. It is characteristically stupid, cliche, and silly.

1. The film begins with an unnecessarily long explanation of the fact that this is a strange land with strange creatures that never existed. I mean, it really gets into some pretty useless exposition. All about great warlocks and demon masks, and ultimate black magic powers, etc. etc. Yeah, we got it. It's a Conan movie. We knew that when we saw the ad. Jeezis. The original wisely skipped all this, and instead gave us the abridged version, and then went straight into title and credits with a sword being hammered. That sequence tells you all you need to know. The rest can work itself out. What's the function of five full minutes of fake history? Is there going to be a test on the BS that never happened? It might still be tolerable, but is so poorly handled and poorly told. It just bores.

2. We finally open on an action scene, some big battle with barbarians. A pregnant warrior woman is stabbed in the gut. Let me repeat that: A PREGNANT WARRIOR WOMAN IS STABBED IN THE GUT. WTF? And, a full nine months pregnant, too. This is absurd. It's insultingly absurd. Then, not only is a 9-months-pregnant woman FIGHTING IN A WAR, but once she is stabbed, her husband runs to her side and they are given all the time in the world to share last loving words while the husband delivers the baby. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BATTLE. Apparently the enemy took a time out so they could have family time. Then, once the baby is born and the woman names her son, Conan of course, as her last dying act, the father holds the baby high into the air and gives his warrior battle cry. That was the final suck.

This was shockingly bad.

Now being found and assembled (some how) by a new despot to again (boring!) wreck havoc upon the world. The rest of the movie is a lot of really bad sword play of slicing and dicing through the bad guys. Also tossed in are a few upper nude females and one only slightly ambiguous sex scene. Well, they did need something to capture the viewer's attention! Acting was robotic, unemotional, and along with the Americanized slanged dialogue it had a TV reality show feel.

4343622,3,B004EPYZTE,"POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

There are about 12 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. During the opening dialog and title there are 7+ CG effects near 25%. Also, the ending credits have glowing embers floating to a maximum of 25%.

The cardboard cutout syndrome is fairly obvious in this title. Many scenes appear to have only 1 to 3 depths with the background or sides starkly flat. Usually when the syndrome wasn't apparent, the 3D lacked depth and crispness. I don't believe this movie was ever intended to be converted into 3D but if it was, they should not admit it.

On a positive note, there were zero of the single instance 3D flaws normally seen in a conversion (that I noticed). The sandmen scenes were great even though the 3D was about the same as in the rest of the movie. Even with its flaws, the 3D adds to the viewing experience of this film.

MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

4343703,2,B004EPYZTE,"Jason Momoa hit every note perfectly - not only does he truly look like REH's description of the wild barbarian (unlike the previous film incarnation), he sounds and acts just like the Conan of the novels. Sadly, it's the stupefying one-dimensional direction that sinks this film. A list of what it lacks is equal to the weights Momoa must have lifted to achieve those amazing pecs.

What surprised me most was learning the film cost $70 million dollars to make, yet the flick feels and plays low-budget. I have to wonder what happened to all that funding? The CGI was adequate, hardly the jaw-dropping spectacle I was hoping to see. And this soon-to-be-on-SciFi-Saturday certainly did not expend its funding on a proven director. Just what about Marcus Nispel's resum said he could guide an established action cache attached to such a historical fanbase? To live up to and exceed expectations? Stunning shortsightedness on the part of the producers is the only reasonable explanation in hiring someone whose background is music videos. Even a commercial director has some sense of character development, of pacing a story, and depth of characterization. Music video directors are their neo-hippie drooling step-cousins; their flashy productions don't even have to make sense.

And it would be an understatement to say I was let down by screenwriters Thomas Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer. They previously scripted a favorite flick in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sahara/dp/B0009UC7H0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sahara</a>' with Matt McConaughey, so I presumed their story would be the foundation upon which fans could be proud. Instead, we're delivered a half-baked mess with only the flimsiest pretense of a plot.

Further, with the sole exception of the always enjoyable Stephen Lang, I found many of the bad guy actors woefully lacking and uninspired. Especially the inner circle of henchmen who were appallingly flat, leaving a great deal to be desired. And coming from a fan of Rose McGowan: Having seen similar roles in a variety of flicks - her performance, while spot-on for her character - lacked a unique style that she could call her own. In my opinion all this, again, lands directly at the feet of Director Nispel. He could've easily gotten more from his artists. Lack of ability and lack of experience shows through on virtually every superficial and inadequate scene.

What made this even more cringe-worthy was the cinematography - Nispel reveals his music video background with every multiple close-up and laughable posed shot.

Then there's the car-sized plot holes:

Example: The chief bad guy and his wannabe incestuous daughter are pulled all over creation in a giant boat. Why? No clue. It's never explained. It certainly seemed important - obviously we're supposed to be intrigued that this humongous water craft is being dragged over dry deserts and high mountains. And bleep me, they sure spent a lot time (money?) making sure we got to see that thing from every angle; as Nispel spends an inordinate amount of film getting it in almost every shot.

Again - why? Can one even have a boat fetish?

Following up on the logic of that boat. The bad guy's intent is to become a god as soon as possible, be reunited with this dead wife, and rule the world. Okay, got that part. And in order to facilitate all that, he and his thugs have to run all over the countryside to locate the various missing pieces so their boss can perform the profane ceremony, check. So then why take a massive ocean voyaging ship over hard scrabble land? Don't think that's going to expedite your mission dude, quite the opposite. In fact, why not just use a bunch of horses? You know, the whole 'speed' thing. If he was in such a flipping hurry, this bad guy sure took his sweet ass time. If this were a more serious film, I would hazard a layman's psychiatric analysis and suggest he subconsciously didn't want to proceed and did everything he could to actually slow down the process.

Stuff like this is what's so infuriating - these are simple issues to work out in pre-production. Having the director and writers sit down over one long lunch and incongruities like these can be addressed, long before a single strip of film passes through the cameras.

Overall, it was an okay flick, but I had higher expectations. Love Momoa's version of the Cimmerian, and again, Stephan Lang can do no wrong as far I'm concerned. Sadly, the production just lacked depth and tangible quality.",1322956800,2,4523,5.018666666666666

The witch daughter played by Rose McGowan was very chilling. I thought she was outstanding. Stephan Lang as the villain was noteworthy as well. He was rather cliche, but pulled it off well. Computer generated special effects were first rate as well. On the downside was Conan, Jason Momoa, was good in looking the part and in the action scenes, but his acting was worse than Arnold's. Can't they find a muscle bound guy that can act too?  Rachel Nichols as Tamara, his love interest was okay. She just seemed mis-cast. She was too demure and then too vicious. She seemed like a good actress though. The most irritating part of the movie is its logic and poor story line. Overall it is typical in that an evil person wants to rule the world. It was just some scenes were just so foolish. If you can overlook that and enjoy some gory violence, naked women, and a little stupidity in the scenes it is a good movie. I would watch it again.

4343708,4,B004EPYZTE,"I am well aware that critics bashed the crap out of this movie. And honestly speaking, I know Conan the Barbarian isn't the greatest movie in the world. At the same time, it's not the worst movie of 2011 either. It's decent at best. On a more personal level, I was entertained from start to finish. The movie is extremely reminiscent of a 90's B movie. That may be why critics weren't too kind to it, and audiences are divided. For the average moviegoer, this movie boils down to personal preference.
 For me, I really liked it. From the action scenes to the casting, the film does its job of being a solid action movie. The greatest strength of this film is Jason Momoa. He is Conan. He has the physique of an 80's action hero (think of Stallone or Schwarzenegger), but the personality of a modern anti-hero. The question you may be asking is if he's better than Schwarzenegger's Conan? The answer is based solely on personal preference. Both of them play Conan equally well, but their different. Schwarzenegger's Conan was stoic and cold. Momoa's Conan is primal and purely instinctual. Again, I love both, and I think Momoa makes an amazing Conan.
 Stephen Lang's Khalar Zym, was nowhere near as amazing as James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom. But you could tell Lang had fun playing Zym. And when an actor has fun playing a villain, especially one that is as clichd and cartoony as Zym, you can't help but be sucked in. And I fell for Lang's Zym.
 There are problems with this movie. There is no denying that. But every problem I have lies with Marcus Nispel's direction and the film's three different writers. I think the choices Nispel made during filming and post-production weren't acceptable. And the script, after three different writers, still needed polishing. But by sheer luck, Conan the Barbarian is the director's best film to date, due to his star's Momoa and Lang. They carry this movie into B movie (or passable) territory that hopefully will find an audience.
 There are plenty out there who will disagree with me liking this film, but I say give the film a chance. It's not for everyone. Conan the Barbarian isn't better than Schwarzenegger's classic, but it's not worse either. It's a good action film, with a good cast, and great set pieces. One thing I should mention for Blu Ray fans is this Blu Ray disc is reference quality. The picture and sound are demo worthy. As for the 3D quality... it's not horrible, but there are better 3D Blu Rays out there. It's average. There's some depth, and some pop out moments, but overall, it doesn't compare to Avatar or Beauty and the Beast 3D Blu Rays.

4343802,2,B004EPYZTE,"Ok, here's some perspective on where I come from with this whole Conan thing. The 1982 film has a special place in my heart. Always has and always will. It's slow and artsy, also powerful. Growing up a young angry man, Arnold's Conan helped mold my character. I'm not joking, I loved that movie. The Destroyer was bad. Familiar faces were nice but it was ultimately a joke. I had read some paperbacks-none of the original works so my understanding of the source material is limited. But the original movie you could tell was made with so much love and dedication, it was a beautiful film. The revenge story, the evolution from a boy to a man, it was all so inspiring to me as a kid. When the new movie was announced I was reserved in my excitement, although my inner child was screaming with anticipation. This was despite the consistent warnings of childhood friends who panned the new re-imagining as a cash grab. I waited, heard some awful reviews, but then again the original had some bad reviews as well. Then I saw the Conan O'brian interview with the lead (momoa)and thought to myself what a likable chap. And he kind of looks like REH's Conan to boot. The other day I almost bought the blue-ray at Target but fortunately passed on it. I ended up ordering it ondemand. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy it. It's sooo bad. The birth of Conan on the battlefield was so unintentionally funny, I actually can say that it was my favorite part of the movie but for the wrong reasons. The rest was forgettable and I fell asleep before the end. It's like an episode of Xena on roids. Shame. The lead wasn't bad, but he wasn't good enough to save this hunk of crap movie. I think I'll be buying the original on blue-ray, my respect for that movie has been resurrected.",1322697600,11,1771,4.418960244648318
4343803,2,B004EPYZTE,"I like the original Arnold Schwarzennegger's ""Conan the Barbarian"" better because the original had a simpler story, which is easier to follow, and it even possessed a pleasant level of humor where even just a little bad acting adds to the humor of the original film.

Jason Momoa was a pretty good casting for the role of Conan, but I think he was just too much of a ""pretty boy"" for this role.  He would have been better placed in the 1984 film of ""Conan the Destroyer"" which, to me, plays more like a campy soft porn fantasy, but without any actual porn. ""Conan the Destroyer"" was just a bunch of pansy acting and was a truly unworthy sequel to the original. I'm sure even Arnold regrets that film too.

Plus, I really appreciated what Sandahl Bergman as Valeria brought to the screen of the original 1982 version.  I wasn't too impressed with Rachel Nichols as Tamara in this new film.  She's OK, but she's no where's near as attractive or as ""exciting"" on the big screen as Sandahl Bergman was. She was a ""goddess"" to me in the original film.

Even the scene with the Witch portrayed by Cassandra Gava added a bit of sexy campiness to the original 1982 film.

Plus, the original 1982 version of Conan had the powerful presence of James Earl Jones, and the dry wit, but mystical and mysterious performance of Mako as the Wizard.  All the characters in the original film showed powerful performances, but yet it was all a simplified enjoyable Saturday matinee experience. This new version had too many screen consuming added effects which makes all of the film seem to have too much irrelevance only to make the visuals more aggressive for the eyes. I like cool visuals, but I still want a simpler story to follow.

I'd watch this film again, sooner than I would watch Schwarzenegger's 1984 film ""Conan the Destroyer"", but as a film to own, I wouldn't watch either one ever again, so I wouldn't buy it either.  I'll cherish the 1982 Blu-Ray of ""Conan the Barbarian"" as the only Conan film that I'd ever keep in my library of films.",1322697600,2,2033,4.545205479452055

This one is clearly a paycheck with some residual deal I'd wager. I think Jason Momoa was cast for his ability to scowl. Rachel Nichols, lacking her natural blonde hair, is sorely misused.

The pacing is spot on and true to the original movies, although i suspect the story is more in line with the comics and less in line with the books. Cant say for sure, as i haven't read either in 20+ years now (although now that i have typed that, i am reminded that i need to go back and do so again).
What i liked about the story itself is that they developed young Conan, showing how his father raised him (played bt Ron Perlman btw), and how Conan ended up as the last Cimmerian.
The rest of the story was okay, and the primary nemesis was pretty awesome, but what really shines is of course...the action. The swordfights and mysticism, the scenery, and just the overall depiction of the world was really cool. They clearly plan on making several more movies, which is great IMO, especially since the original two movies left me wanting more for more than twwenty years.

The action was good, the sets worked to give it a real feel for the Hyboria, and (shock horror) the acting wasn't too bad. Is it epic brilliance? No, not really. It is however an entertaining sword and sorcery flick, and well above average quality for the genre. Comparing against the wonderful kitsch of the Arnie movies from the 80s isn't going to work, they're just different and there are elements of both movies that are excellent.
To pick negatives, the 2011 version felt like the plot was a little rushed; i.e. the characters went from action sequence to action sequence without enough time in between for the audience to catch it's breath, or give the characters the oppertunity to explain and deepen the plot a little. The end result being that it was hard to really empathise with the characters, or in some cases really understand the plot if one wasn't an afficionado of the books. The orignal Conan was strengthened by an amazing musical score; this movie lacked that.

Overall? Worth renting on an evening with nothing much else to do, it will enjoyably pass the time. I'd only buy it if you're a die hard fan.",1322438400,,1208,4.56221198156682

I enjoyed the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. This one is a Disney version of the story. While watching it, I was thinking this is not Conan. Conan is not really a nice guy but to his friends. He does not rescue strangers out of the goodness of his heart, often he is to them amoral.

The acting was not particularly good. I did not think anyone was good. Part of the problem is although Jason Momoa is a good actor, I do not think he was allowed to develop the role as it should be done and Rachel Nichols was nothing in the role. Knock out the two main roles and what is left of the movie?

Its sad that Hollywood can continue to so badly drop the ball with this genre (...and in general) while CABLE TV NETWORKS like HBO churn out a quality product like Game of Thrones. What's even worse, is that this movie did so poorly that we'll be lucky to see another shot taken at such a great property (Conan).

4344012,4,B004EPYZTE,"Okay, look, with a heady dose of ""your mileage may vary"" allow me to net it out as I see it.

First off, some history and background.

Comparisons to the 1982 Ahnold version are pointless. That movie was terrible on countless levels and only survives for its sheer audacious camp and silliness. It is to the Conan mythos what the Adam West series is to Batman. Before everyone gets their knickers in a bunch, I've watched it many times and enjoyed it for what it is (I like Adam West as Batman too), but holding it up as an example of anything other than Frazzetta-inspired schlock is misguided. It's a ""classic"" in that it captures a moment in cinematic history, but then so is ""Heavy Metal"" which is also fun in the right frame of mind but terribly flawed by any rational standard.

Next, let's face it, the original works, while they had a flare and flavor, were not exactly classics of literature either. Conan is rough, brutal, reaver who seizes control of a failing kingdom and struggles to become a ruler instead of a robber. That story line would be far more interesting to watch and would actually require some character development, something both movies pretty much ignore. The source material is not King Lear, and for the most part it's not even Spider Man, so reverence for the flawed canon is in my opinion misplaced.

Now, for the movie itself, I thought it captured the character of Conan and the world of Hyborea spot on. Jason Momoa nails the roguish, clever, but brutal Conan much better than Arnold's brooding, unintelligible barbarian. However, I think top honors go to the boy who plays the young Conan in the egg race, a scene which sums up the random brutality of Hyborea and establishes Conan's character. From the egg-spitting scene on in, it's a fun ride but it's standard sword and sorcery farce and a downhill slide. More Ron Perlman, I say.

All in all, by the time you decide to sit down and watch a movie called ""Conan the Barbarian"" you've signed up for a flashy piece of pseudo-medieval eye candy with flashing swords and shallow characters. The 2011 version delivers in spades, with far less dead time than the 1982 version (e.g: I get it, the wheel makes him strong, but how long do we need to watch him walk in a circle to make a point...) If you though the version with Arnold was a brilliant adaptation of the source material, you'll hate this one. If you're looking for a modern brilliant interpretation of the relatively shallow canon, this is not it either. For action-packed, testosterone-laden escapism with large amounts of sharpened steel and even larger amounts of well-toned exposed flesh, this version serves up what it promises and should be judged on its own merits.",1322265600,,2718,4.677824267782427
4344013,5,B004EPYZTE,"As a youth in the 60's, I cut my teeth on Howard's Conan, loving the pure barbaric truth of his nature.
I had a thirst for Howard's work, and I drank it in with the gusto of Conan drinking wine. I truly could not get enough.
That being said, there is nothing Conan that would not at least hold my interest.
This movie cannot be compared to the prior issues. Arnold, Sandahl, Mako, Pro Surfer Jerry Lopez, and James Earl Jones, were wonderful. In 1982, it was more than I could ask for. The second movie and Red Sonia were disappointing to me, but I still have watched them many times.
In 2001, I was ready for new high adventure with Conan, and that was given to me. Those who adversely criticize this movie do not truly love the genre, and perhaps I do not truly care for what their opinions are, such is my affection for Howard's work.
Chad Stahelski, the sword master of this movie, did a great job, and Momoa has given credence to that.
Rachel Nichols beauty was subdued, in my opinion, to make her more believable as a tough warrior woman.
Momoa was perfect in a way Arnold was not, rangy and perhaps more truly barbaric, though Arnold fit the Howard character with his massive build.
For those who did not like this movie, its fast pace, and great actors, I leave you with my favorite Howard quote.

""Civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split, as a general thing.""

You'd think with a $90 Million budget, we'd see something absolutely spectacular. The thing that gets me even more is the fact that the director is Marcus Nispel. Marcus Nispel, as you all may know, is the director who remade The Texas Chainsaw Massacre & Friday the 13th(both of whom were box-office successes). To me, the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  was even better than the original so you can see why it really gets to me.

This remake tells the story of a young boy born on the battlefield who grows up hellbent on avenging his father's death yet his vendetta escalates into something much more where he faces the most impossible of odds.

Seems to me that where the film falls is in actor Jason Momoa. His portrayal of Conan is simply awful. Like I read somewhere in another review of the movie online, it seems as though Momoa felt like he couldn't live up to Arnold Schwarzennegar's Conan. Let's face it, Momoa has the pecs for the movie...I just wish he would've shown some passion for the role. Too, the screenplay lacked depth and scope which could've been another reason why this movie failed.

The action in the movie is tight, however, and gory. That, I hate to say, seems to be the only redeeming value to this movie.

As much as I'd like to recommend this Conan to everyone, I'm afraid that I can't. Heck, Conan the Adventurer(the TV series) was even better than this and it was made on a cheaper budget.

I really like Jason Momoa from Game of Thrones, love Stephen Taylor from Avatar and Terra Nova, and Ron Jeremy from Sons of Anarchy.  But, the story in this movie is just flat and boring.  And a rip-off.  Here's what you learn in the first 30 seconds. (mild spoiler alert, but this is right in the beginning) There was an ancient, magical face mask made from pieces of bone.  When all the bone pieces are together, the mask wearer can rule other kings.  The original evil mask owner was vanquished long ago in an epic battle, and the mask's bone pieces were separated and spread about the land.  But, a new evil ruler-to-be wants to reassemble the mask, and needs all the pieces so he can - wait for it - rule all the other kings.  Sound familiar?  All this movie needs is Frodo and a ring and the rip-off would be complete.  I found myself drifting off.  The update changes up the story from the original obviously, and starts off promising a decent updating of a classic movie despite the been-there, done-that plot, but then it just drifts off into the same generic revenge movie you have seen a million times.  The swordfights are so frequent, uninspiring, and by the numbers, that you will find yourself wondering why you can't hear the music that all these choreographed fighters/dancers are dancing to. We never cared about any of the characters because they are so one-dimensional that you know what they are going to say and do before they do it on screen.

I find it very amusing that an Austrian body builder with little acting experience in 1982 was able to bring such vast depth to the character of Conan. The lead roles in this plot less version are shallow at best. Conan's whole quest was due to his father's murder, in John Milius's version Conan had a lot more to be mad about, his family and village destroyed and then he is put into slavery pushing a wooden wheel for twenty years. Then the antagonist kills Conan's Queen. The clown in this version was just not convincing, the only battle training Conan received was from his father. While in the original, Conan was sent to the oriental War Masters to learn to become a great warrior, he was also forced into reading and writing. Jason momoa or whatever his name is would surprise me if he actually knew how to read. Again in the original Conan was not a lone wolf, he had friends who would die for him and together they brought down Thulsa Doom. In this version the antagonist is not quite as frightening as James Earl Jones, not quite as potent. Stephen Lang looked like an overly adorned fool. There was no character development and the movie was very loud and looked more like 'The Mummy"". They substituted acting and plot for special effects and noise.

4344138,3,B004EPYZTE,"Conan the Barbarian is about sort of the start of Conan's legend. Our hero is born on the battlefield after his mother receives a fatal blow and he is raised by his father. Later when Conan is a young boy an evil warlord and his witch daughter come to his village, everyone but Conan get killed and the whole movie is a quest for revenge. Yes there is a rather flimsy story in there about ancient artifacts and a necromantic mask and even a maiden in distress but plot wise this movie is lacking. I sat watching the entire movie expecting some plot twist, some depth, anything, but no there is nothing there is just fight, fight, fight, kill the bad guy and stop his evil plot, get the girl, ride off into the sunset, and that is all there is. The plot of Conan the Barbarian is sourly missing.

Now I do not think this is a bad movie, the visuals are fantastic, the fight scenes are exiting and very creative and the actors all do a good job. Jason Momoa is perfect as Conan, Rachel Nichols do a good job with our main heroine, though the character herself is rather bland, Rose McGowan is ravishing as the evil witch Marique, my favorite character of the whole movie, Stephen Lang manages to get the very stereotypical bad guy Khalar Zym interesting. The supporting cast to do a great job. The music of Conan the Barbarian is forgettable but do frame the movie well.

As eye candy this movie work well, it is entertaining, however I wonder a bit where the producer is going with this, even the short stories in the Conan comic books have more depth than this story, none of the characters are more than cardboard cut outs and they never develop during the course of the movie, and then there are the plot holes like how come Tamara who is a monk in a secluded monastery do not bat an eyelash at killing people? I am not saying she have to be innocent, but give some explanation for when I see a cleric in white robes I am not thinking cold blooded murderer, fighting skills yes, sure she can have learned those at the monastery, but why is she so used to killing people?

I did enjoy myself when I watched this movie, it is a good popcorn flick but I had hoped for something more, some betrayals, some story twists, anything but oh I am going to kill the man who killed my father, what do you know I found him, let me just plow through his henchmen and then get him. For the entertainment value and the great visuals I give Conan the Barbarian 3 stars, the movie do really capture the look of the books and the comics, but I can not give it more due to the flat storyline no matter how much i really want to like it.

I recommend Conan the Barbarian as a mindless action flick, a way to spend two hours if you are bored and just want to stare at a screen and be entertained by swords, magic, guts and boobs, a few good one liners which will make you smile, and a basic revenge plot, if however you want anything more than that then this movie is not for you.",1322179200,,2960,4.24290780141844

The bar was set very high for this film because of the expectations of hard core conan fans and the excellent robert milius original film from 1982. The film lacks atmoshphere and the character development scenes feel outright flat. This feels very much like any other big money hollwood action movie,

Pro's are it has Interesting scenery and costumes, the casting is actually not bad at all. Jason Momoa is not a bad choice as is evidenced by his very strong ( and less wordy) portryal of Khal drogo on game of thrones. Rose Mcgowan is sexy and witchy. The main villain Stephen Lang has some chops and charisma.

The problem with this film ( there are more than a few) is that the movie feels contrived instead of sincere. Real cinematic story telling takes patience and it has to challenge the viewer to care about the story and characters. This is absolutely a dumbed down, fast paced, cut scene to cut scene movie. Some of the violence was particularly over the top and lame and lacked impact. Conan torturing a guy and sticking his finger through his nose hole to bleed him to death to me was a cheap attempt at shock value. Alot of big money was spent on the production of this movie to no avail. It looked very glossy, to be honest it looked alot like pirates of the carribean rather than conan the barbarian.

4344142,1,B004EPYZTE,"I gave this movie a go for one reason - Momoa. He's a perfect tough-guy and he's sexier than any one human should be. It turns out, though, that this film is watchable only because of another of his traits: charisma (which is a part of his sexiness, most likely). This movie wanders around with Conan whose principal goal is clear while his methods for achieving it are not. There's none of that pathos/ethos stuff with any of the characters so that people appear to be fighting each other just to keep from being bored. Sure, you witness Conan's loss when he is a brave child warrior, a loss that is grotesque and powerful, but it doesn't really seem to build his character as much as validate it. Even action movies, I expect a little character development. I certain can't do without a plot. This is the sort of movie that should have been formulaic yet satisfying and, instead, was more like a promotional entry into Mr. Momoa's portfolio. As that, though, I can accept the film because I hope to see much more of him.",1322092800,2,1022,4.5
4344143,2,B004EPYZTE,"HELLO,

THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, SO TAKE IT AS SUCH.  THIS MOVIE SUCKED.  THE ORIGINAL CONAN WAS AND STILL IS, THE ONLY ONE.  ARNOLD WOULD HAVE MADE LIGHT WORK OUT OF THIS DUDE.  YOU CAN NOT MAKE UP FOR ACTING WITH SPECIAL EFFECTS.  THE CAST OF THE ORIGINAL WAS GREAT.  THIS NEW ONE, NOT SO MUCH.  I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE NOT NAMED IT CONAN.

THANKS",1322092800,3,348,4.074626865671642
4344144,5,B004EPYZTE,"I believe that Robert E Howard would have approved this version of Conan with high fives, thumbs up and all smiles. Beautiful cinematography. Great sets. Top notch acting -- I loved the grittiness and realism, much of the 'high-quality' filmmaking experienced in viewing Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. 3D was well done but not distracting. Jason Momoa captured Conan exactly how I picture Conan from the books I grew up on.

Momoa's Conan was smart with purpose, not the wise-cracking, muscle-hunk that Schwarzenegger portrayed. The pirates, the kingdoms, everything was as-the-books-portrayed. This movie was made by people who wanted to capture Howard's world of Conan. I hope they make more in this series. With the same quality of story and character.

I will watch this movie many times. Note -- we have a 73"" high definition TV with 3D and surround sound -- so we really got to view (and hear) this movie in a perfect setting. The nudity and violence did not bother me, but may make some hesitate -- they went for realism and they succeeded brilliantly. A+ movie on 3D BluRay.",1322092800,4,1088,4.875675675675676
4344145,2,B004EPYZTE,"Despite it's mammothly disappointing box office take and lukewarm reviews, I still looked forward to seeing this remake/reboot/re-whatever of Conan the Barbarian.  In all honesty, the film has a lot going for it, with some brilliant visual set pieces and set designs that wonderfully bring pulp writer Robert E. Howard's savage world to life, but other than that, the film itself feels oh so empty.  Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones) stars as Conan, the Cimmerian warrior seeking vengeance for the destruction of his people at the hands of warlord Khalar Zym (a scene-chewing Stephen Lang), and in turn embarks on a quest to save all of Hyboria as Zym's master plan begins to come to fruition.  Along for the ride are Rose McGowan as Zym's witchy daughter, and hottie Rachel Nichols as the pawn in Zym's plot; granted neither of them have all that much to work with.  In fact, nearly the entire cast of Conan the Barbarian do little to make things memorable, other than Stephen Lang.  The film's story is plenty predictable, and despite all the swordplay and blood and carnage on the screen, you never get that same sense of excitement or wonder from the proceedings like you did in the original 1982 Arnold Schwarzenegger film.  All in all, this new take on Conan the Barbarian isn't absolutely horrible, but it doesn't have the same heart and soul to it that the original film had.",1322006400,46,1379,4.773109243697479

Theres no shortage of savage sword-play, splattered blood, severed heads, and scantily-clad women! Robert E. Howard would be proud to put his stamp of approval on this.

If you liked the original Conan the Barbarian of 1982, starring Arnold Schwartzenegger, you won't be disappointed either. Where the 1982 version had a more mythic feel (especially with Basil Poledouris' sound-track), ...the new version is definitely the original gut-gripping action-all-the-way pulp-novel come to life! Jason Momoa is even more convincing as the brooding barbarian who stomps across the Hyborean world with sword in hand. Niether movie follows a specific plot to one of the many Conan novels. Its the general ""idea"" of Conan that matters here, its still pretty good! Give us at least two sequels!",1322006400,2,922,5.181208053691275
4344266,1,B004EPYZTE,"This movie immediately limps out of the gate with a pathetic narration by Morgan Freeman. It doesn't even come close to Mako's original narration over ""Anvil of Crom"". I still get chills every time I watch the opening of the 1982 Conan. I'd probably get diarrhea if I ever watched this stupid movie again.

I'm well aware that people claim this movie is closer to Howard's stories than the Arnold movie. But they still chose to use the exact same title and title design as the 82 version, in a sad attempt to gain ticket sales.

They claim this movie ""is a new interpretation of the Conan mythology, and is not related to the films featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger."" Oh really? So, the ""raiders slaughtered my village, killed my father and stole his sword"" theme is new?
Then there is the ""Mystery of Steel"" which is a direct rip off of the ""Riddle of Steel"", which, if I am correct, was an invention of Milius and Stone. And holy frozen lake training sequence, Batman! -do I even have to point out where they stole that idea from?  They even had the nerve to use the Atlantean sword in a promotional poster.

Momoa as Conan was a total casting failure. He is way too pretty to be Conan. He would probably fit in better on Jersey Shore than in Hyboria. He looked like he was trying too hard. At least Arnold possessed the natural arrogance that comes across in Howard's Conan. The supporting characters in this movie could be cut and pasted into a dozen other Pirates of the Caribbean/ Thor/ Clash of the Remake/ 300 or any other ""Braveheart part 97"" type movies.
This movie makes the PG rated ""Conan the Destroyer"" look like a masterpiece.

It takes more than CGI to make a movie, especially remake a movie. Hollywood totally jacked up ""Clash of the Titans"" with the idea that 3D will make up for bad acting, no story and absolutely zero character development. And now they ruined yet another classic. Just wait. Soon they will be promoting ""The Godfather in 3D"", staring Justin Bieber as Michael Corleone!

Kinda like you always wonder about Jesus' teen years.  Show me that, too, please.  All in all, great flick.  Momoa was perfect as Conan in the sense people are used to: blending the Frazetta idea and R E Howard's vision of the character.  Smarter than the Arnold Conan.  And your average bear.  Emotion, reaction......Awesome.
The leading lady was good as well.  They made her somewhat tough on her own, which is good.  Conan wouldn't want a damsel in distress in that way.

I'm actually mystified by the many, many bitterly disappointed reviews.  Though it does not follow the stories, it takes minimal liberties with Conan's origin, and captures the spirit of the character and the world very well.

I still have a soft spot for the Arnold films, and personally have tired of the remakes, reboots, and sequels of today. I just recently watched this... the dvd mind you, not the blu ray, and all i can say is I really enjoyed it. This is more of an attempt at remaking a franchise then continuing the arnold films... but not to a fault. The story begins with an origin, which is appropriate beings how most know the conan name, but not the story. The action is bloody, and vicious, the acting is surprisingly good, and the dialogue seemed witty and not as cliched as most might have you believe. Yes it has some fantasy elements, but instead of it being a 2 hour film opus of cgi it is used sparingly and where needed. the film does play out like one long action film, where you barely get enough time to breath before the next battle, which might have been a drawback for most films, but kept this one moving until the climax. Jason Momoa does a fine job at the role of conan, he has the muscular prowess of the character and is filled with the look of rage in battle and the charm when not, which is opposed to (however much it was a defining character for arnold) arnolds clunky ""too big to move very fast"" conan interpretation and Jason Momoa adds more personality to the role as well instead of being this brooding brute throughout the film.

4344386,5,B004EPYZTE,I don't understand where all the bad reviews are coming from. As the director and Robert E. Howard described; Conan is like a panther. He's not the muscle bound Arnold Swartzenegger version from the 80's. The movies borrow from the best of the Howard mythology. Ron Pearlman was ideal to portray Conan's father. The action was very brutal; however it was just like it was described in the actual source material. The dark fantasy aspect of the movie blends more reality than expected. Moma as Conan was perfect for the role. He moved just like the character did in the Marvel Comics version. The interviews with Roy Thomas from Marvel demonstrated how unknown the character was to the general public in 1970. If you saw any of the Frank Frazetta book covers or John Buscema Conan comics; you would see Moma did the research. The producers and Moma himself are all fans of the original books and it appears on the screen. Arnold's portrayal shouldn't be the template.,1321920000,5,966,4.755952380952381
4344387,4,B004EPYZTE,"So as a hardcore fantasy geek, I owe director Marcus Nispel and star Jason Momoa a ""Thank you"" for NOT taking an utter massive steaming dump on the legacy of Robert E. Howard, one of the founding fathers of modern heroic adventure fiction, though obviously not for lack of moron studio execs trying to make them.

2011's CONAN THE BARBARIAN - Way better, more invigorating and involving than I'd hoped, but still a frustratingly uneven movie - mostly in the writing, but also tonally. Everything that's right/wrong with this picture can be summed with Morgan Freeman's opening voice-over narration. As the music and lights rise, we hear Freeman speaking ""Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities..."" And yep, it's the most awesome such oration this side of Ian McKellen uttering ""One Ring to rule them all..."" ...Then about a third in, said voice-over veers off into some LOTR-ripoff scattered-deus-ex-machina evil artifact bulls**t from the hack end of the screenwriting-by-committee team. Of people who gave this thumbs-up/thumbs-down, everyone agrees that the opening act, featuring Conan-as-a-boy (Leo Howard - no known relation to REH) and his father (Ron Perlman) is the best part. And DAMN, were they not kidding! I'd have been perfectly happy had the whole movie stuck with the young-Conan-and-Dad team. The chemistry's so right, I ain't gonna lie, the inevitable conclusion of this portion had me a little choked up. The rest of the movie can't seem to decide if it wants to be a remake of the '82 Milius/Schwarzenegger movie or its own, truer take on the material. What keeps it afloat is Jason Momoa as Conan. He strikes a harder-than-it-looks balance between likable, intelligent and relateable, but also believably savage and ruthless, at times downright terrifying to a startlingly *un*likable degree. To say we don't get big screen action-hero characters with this much dimension often enough is an understatement. I just wish more of the story-telling surrounding him had as much sense. Nods/references to Howard's original stories were a joy to spot, but I have to ask myself the same question one often asks about, say, the Star Wars prequels: If it weren't for my built-in fondness for what it's drawing on, would it stand on its own so well in this context? Sadly, I don't think so. The villains: Stephen Lang is no James Earl Jones by a long shot, but he's convincingly, palpably nasty, and is no easy pickin's for our hero/anti-hero; As for Rose McGowen as an evil sorceress, all I can really say is... Mmmmmm, yeeeesssssss... She's a baaaaaaaad girl who does baaaaaaaaaaad things... and I like her >:-) *AHEM!* Anyway. The action here is brutal, breathless, visceral... and often jaw-droppingly over the top, with supernatural/fantastical elements that often play into this nicely. I frequently laughed out loud (in a good way) at the sheer audacity of how bugf**k bats**t ""HOLY CRAP, DID THEY REALLY JUST FREAKIN' DO THAT?"" insane this gets, in ways I won't spoil (my favorite bit involves a guard sliding back a panel to see who's there, then NOT getting what he expects when he opens the door). But this also becomes one of the film's biggest problems. This may sound weird to some talking about a Conan movie, but after a while it gets TOO heavy on one huge action set-piece after another. Yeah, the Hyborian Age is a chaotic, primal, dangerous, tough-as-nails, morally ambiguous, unforgiving world, but it's also a haunting, brooding, fantastical, bittersweet, hypnotically beautiful, mystery-shrouded landscape like none other. The best Conan stories are as much about this as all the bloody mayhem, the cinematography captures it spot-on, and I found myself longing for more of those quiet, reflective moments to just bask in it a spell.",1321920000,3,3799,5.059011164274322

Thank God, I was wrong. Well kinda wrong. The violence is graphic, the battles are earsplittingly adrenalized, and Mr. Mamoa has plenty of muscle to flex and is no sweetheart pansy!

Also unlike most people my age who grew up and watched the original over and over I never really ""got it"".  Lately with all the remakes coming out I have been trying to watch the originals either again or for the first time.  What I have found by watching the original ""Arthur"" and ""Fright Night"" is that I thought they were OK.  After watching the new ones I realized how much better they were then the new ones.  This version of Conan is a lot like that.  Remembering scenes from the original and comparing them really made me appreciate the original more and more.  By the end (much like the other ones I mentioned) I viewed the originals in a different and better light.  All that said, again I am not really a fan of these movies so a huge fan may like this much more then I did.  Overall, unless you are a fan of this type of genre I would stick with the original.

What film did you haters see? How about you misbegotten charlatans and frauds who are well-known ""critics"" that are just bitter you could never get a script of your own made into a feature? Because if you saw Conan, you should at least have a sprinkling of a grasp of Conan and his world and how the stories are fleshed out from the pulp novels of nearly a century ago and comic books from decades ago when fantasy and fiction COULD be told in the manner this film unravels.

""The mask angle was stupid!"" ""The sorcery angle was stupid!"" ""He's mean to females!"" Yep, that's how the vibe for the stories has ALWAYS been, and Nispel clearly did his homework, but hey, feel free to complain over nonsense!

This one's cute, too: ""Him and his father train with swords on ICE! What a rip-off of Batman Begins!!!"" Yeah, and I'm sure no other film in human history had two people training on ice before Batman Begins came out just a handful of years ago, right? For example, no martial arts film from any country anywhere anytime, I'm sure! Sigh, Americans, that's all I'm going to say!

There's also ""It looks like a made-for-TV movie!"" No, it does not. At all. That's just a feeble attempt to try and further smear the film in much the same way the comment I mentioned in the previous paragraph is. It isn't based on anything factual and is the product of complete and utter cluelessness. People who say such unfounded foolishness are outright delusional, there's really no Option B about it.

To conclude, the characters/locations/scenarios are straight out of the Conan stories of yesteryear (again, something you should have probably wrapped your head around in advance before stepping one foot in the theater), it's perfectly paced, the action is literally nonstop, the costumes and set pieces are as good as any fantasy movie not associated with Tolkien, and it looks and sounds absolutely stunning.

The mature Conan is even worse, looks like a model for JC Pennys

- Production and Direction is poor, from the opening sequence when a eleven year old conan at 70-lbs beats and kills a party of battle hardened barbarians....  the unrealism continues through the battles as you see a horseman get shot with an arrow the horse is thrown backward from a full gallop; in another scene a heavily armored wagon is thrown thirty feet into the air when the harness from the team of horses is broke in battle... 110-lb women throwing around 250-lb barbarians in battle, who knows why they couldn't cast better actors; these directors didn't even try.

- Make-up, and FX are poor; throughout the movie you'll get the feeling the actors all just got out of the salon... hair-do's are all heavily shampooed and conditioned, and after months pass in the story where the characters continue their quest, they remain clean and freshly shaven...

4344477,4,B004EPYZTE,"3D Conan 2011 Review: Buy it.

3D REVIEW:
What do I expect with 3D? Great depth to tell apart objects easily with two eyes, and occasionally, some objects that move outside the screen.
Having just reviewed the film a second time, this time on the 3D Blu Ray, the 3D in the 2nd half of the movie, starting with the scene where Conan fights the Sand People, has great 3D depth that does not disappoint. The first half however, lacks enough depth, and takes the 8/10 3D down to a 7/10 3D rating. The first hour of the 1h52m film has very average 3D where you question why you're bothering wearing 3D glasses. You can see some hint of depth, is the best way to put it. But if you're a 3D fan looking for a really good and brutal sword battle movie, buy the 3D version, as it also includes 2D viewing on the same disc, and the 2nd hour of the film has great 3D. Nonetheless, the film itself makes up for the 1st hour's minimal 3D with some thrilling, gory action.

3D: 7/10. The 2nd half of the film's 3D looks great. It's like they put all of their post process effort into that point onward. Before that though, mostly average 3D and not enough depth in that first half, which all comes down to the stereographers doing the 3D post processing. Did they have the time, or were they lacking the boldness required to make a scene POP? Or did they learn their lessons from the first half as evidenced by the well done 3D in the 2nd half?

Conan the Barbarian 2011 has plenty of bloody combat with swords, sorcery and is well filmed, so you can follow the fights visually without confusion. Conan sets off on his adventure to avenge his father, stop the powerful Leader from gaining the mask of power, rescue the beautiful babe and slaughter anything that stands in his way. If you're looking for a film to enlighten the mind, Conan isn't about that. This film is about adventure and barbaric swordfighting. By the end of the film, I was really impressed with the amount of nearly non stop action here. In the end, a gritty sword adventure showcasing a fearsome, brutal army of enemy warriors for Conan to face, along with Sand People, a Tentacle Creature in the water, and more.

Recommended for action, fantasy genre fans who want action before story.",1321660800,3,2245,4.428571428571429
4344478,4,B004EPYZTE,"first thing I will say is that this movie is almost 100% diffrent then the movie by the same name made in 1982. However I think it was cast totaly better. The acting is not the best but I think it all fits the movie.

Alot of people compare this movie to the 1982 movie but don't b/c the 1982 movie was worse IMO it was long (Far to long) not enough action and the story got rather confusing b/c it was so long.

Then alot of people wanna compare this movie to howards book and again Don't b/c Books and movies are two diffrent worlds don't ever compare b/c what some people see  in a book and what others wanna put in a movie are always two diffrent things.

This movie it's self is a action flick with lots of blood lots of violance and yep as in the conan books there is nudity so I would never recomend this for children it dose earn its R rating.

If your looking for a good Action flick and a good fantasy movie pick this one up You won't be disapointed.",1321660800,,960,4.031578947368421

4344480,1,B004EPYZTE,"Top 10 check list for a lousy Conan Movie....
1) Find the most monotone, uninspiring narrator possible for voice-over (Morgan Freeman)
2) Cast Conan as a gym drop-out, muscle-less B-list actor
3) Cast Ron Perelman in any role
4) Ignore everything Robert E. Howard ever wrote about Conan
5) Only use Frazetta inspired imagery for the baddies
6) Create a truly bland, forgettable score
7) Pay as little as possible for props - buy plastic swords, knives and costumes on closeout from a Halloween store
8) All wood must be rotten, so head-butts or stomps will shatter any plank, spindle or board
9) The only power a ""new"" god has is the power to scream like a woman
10) Those who are evil, will in the end, forget how to fight, get clumsy and chicken out

And that's just the start.  The only thing this mess had to do with Conan was that they called one of the characters by that name. They could have cast Conan O'Brien as Conan and it would not have been worse. It would have sold more tickets, though.

I like Morgan Freeman - in the appropriate place. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" ""March of the Penguins"" ""Conan the Barbarian"" - which movie does not belong in that list?

Look, Cimmeria is supposed to be a rugged land of warriors - not some lame 2nd rate vacation re-enactment spot.  ""300"" had it right - send the kids out, see who survives. In this waste of time? Have the kids run around a hill with a small egg in their mouth. Whomever returns with the unbroken egg, wins.  What's next? Run down the hill with a cup of beer and see who spills the least?!? Then there's Conan's birth.  Anyone else notice that this was in the middle of a raging (albeit very lame) battle - and during the birth, everyone vanished - maybe it was lunch time.

Perlman's lack of muscle and tone was distracting - I mean, this is a Cimmerian warrior?!? Jason Momoa would not have placed in the top 20 at any fitness or bodybuilding show. No muscles to speak of - not even a six-pack. This is the ""massive"" warrior who ""towered"" over everyone in his tribe, even as a youth. Yet here, Conan is the runt of the tribe. When he returns to his village with his collection of gory trophies, the men and women seem ready to faint. Huh? These are seasoned, blood-thirsty WARRIORS, remember? The tribe should have been more like the warriors from ""300"" - all ready to kick butt, not pass out at the first sign of blood.

The battles were pathetic - the choreography was terrible. Watch the slave drivers use the whip - they have no idea how to us it! Or the scene where Conan ""frees"" the slaves. He rolls boulders down a hill, indiscriminately - yet only the slavers (and a cart of lettuce and some oranges) gets nailed!  When the topless women  slaves ask what's to become of them, it's basically servitude to Conan and his army (of which we ever only see three or four people) - and everyone cheers! I should note that the topless women are played by the least animated women ever to ""grace"" the screen - who thought bouncing C's and D's could be this uninspiring? Or un-interesting. They needed lessons from Russ Meyer.

Watch when the freed slaves have to retrieve the key - look at the blades. Blunt and plastic! The bone mask? OK, it was broken with a simple sword blow.  Everyone knows it should never be reassembled.  Why not just destroy the fragments? Toss them in a volcano, crush them, and so on - keep them in ornate boxes under a floorboard?! (and did you notice how generations later the boards looked the same and there was no dust on the box?!) When it is complete - nothing. No effects - audio or visual. Did it look to you like they simply forgot to add the effects there? Oh yea, the DVD / BlueRay cover? Photoshop. Totally touched up. The movie slogan ""Born on the battlefield"" - how lame is that?

One of the paragraphs from a Conan book still sticks in my mind. Conan returned to his homeland after years of adventures.  Hey lays on the frozen, snow covered ground to sleep, half naked.  Conan bunches up some ice and snow to rest his head on.  One Cimmerian warrior remarks - to paraphrase - ""He has become soft - look - Conan needs a pillow to rest his head on!""  Does this sound like the wimps that infest this movie?

Conan is constantly out of breath, panting after a run uphill. When he has to scale a wall, it's look for the easy way or stairs. In the novels, Conan is spidey-like in his ability to scale walls, cliff faces, craggy fortress walls - you name it. Here, he looks for the stairs. Or an elevator.

4344484,5,B004EPYZTE,"First of all, the first Conan movie was merely an opportunity for Milius and Stone to thrown in a few REH references to make their movie the way they wanted it, which was THEIR philosphy, not Howard's. For his time, Arnie did a pretty good job embodying the Conan character but I always felt he was too musclebound compared to the way Howard described him. I wasn't even too sure about Jason Momoa until I saw the actual trailer for this film and I realized he did his homework in understanding Howard's Conan. After seeing the film I realized he was the perfect match to play the young barbarian in his new adventures in the Hyborian world. I am not referring at all to the comics because they were a genre unto themselves. I am referring to the orginal, Howard's Conan. For any of us who were fans of
REH prior to the comics and films, this was the definitive source material to reference in this movie. Yes, there are weak spots of story line in the film, but generally I felt I was actually watching the exploits of Conan as Howard had imagined him and I believe REH would have been pleased with the results of this movie. No, you are not going to make every Howard fan happy with this film, we are a diverse lot and very impassioned about our hero and his author. But for me, I felt very happy with the result. I hope the sales of this DVD shyrocket enough to warrant a sequel, because I was so depressed to see so few who actually went to see this movie in the theaters. Jason Momoa, you are truly Conan. Thanks for the great job you did in this movie. Marcus Nispell, I have ""Pathfinder"" on Blu-Ray DVD and will also get this movie. You did a great job.

The first Conan with Arnold to the Savage Sword of Conan comics, and yes even Conan the Adventurer cartoons. This movie was by far the most disappointing (yes even more the Conan the Destroyer). The first 20 minutes of the film were good, to which everyone agrees. But the next hour or more of the movie was horrible. The casting of Conan wasn't that bad, however, Conan is a barbarian, this character was too soft and he talked too much. Action sequences were too far in between and even then the most you would get is fake blood splatter... really.... really??? Personally, I would say wait for cable.

There was a lot more humor than I expected, just the right amount of gore and nudity (how can it not, being a barbarian movie) and left me with a very clear picture of what life as a barbarian might be like.

4344608,5,B004EPYZTE,"I have been a Conan fan since 1972, when my big brother Johnny and his wife,Sharyn, bought me my first Conan book 'cause I was intrigued by the cover. One read, and I was hooked! Little did any of us know then, that Johnny's beautiful wife would die only four years later.
Johnny himself was my lifelong best friend/fill-in dad/and hero. Where I was a geek;he was the family black sheep, given to brooding; brawling (he never lost a fight in or out of the boxing ring!)and a temper that made The Hulk look like a school-girl. I tell you this, not to share my life's story,but to explain my vested interest in;indeed, love for,the character REH created. Because, with the rage; the blue eyes; the brooding; the lustiness;etc.,when I read the books, I saw Johnny as the character. Sadly, I lost him 2 years ago. And with him,my world. So, if anybody had a personal reason to view the new ""Conan the Barbarian"" with a wary eye, it was me. And I was blown away!
  I won't list each and every little thing they got right...we'd be here all day. But I will say that it is 90% the essence of Howard's character. There's also some of Thomas's; Truman's...hell, even a nod or two to Milius, who clearly didn't get Conan at all! (Groveling and whining at an enemies feet; looking ashamed,head down, refusing to meet a king's gaze, in a throne room?!This is NOT Conan! Where's the arrogance? The defiance in the face of his captors? The rage at his enemies?...In the Nispel version, that's where!)
  There are those who say it should have gone to a Cameron; a Jackson; even Ridley Scott or Mel Gibson. Jackson, based on the first 2 ""Rings"" films, okay. But ""Return of the King"";""King Kong""? They are 'disappointing' to be kind. Cameron hasn't made a film with true excitement and rooting interest since ""Aliens"";Scott has way too many muted conversations and far too much ""Saving-Private-Ryan""-shaky-cam action in ""Gladiator and His ""Kingdom of Heaven"" & ""Robin Hood""? Yawn! Gibson has too many scenes of basically the same conversation between Robert the Bruce and Wallace in ""Braveheart"" and his action is either poorly photographed or nonexistant.(A siege that sort of begins;is never shown;and the next scene we see Wallace and company fleeing the burning ruins? Sheesh!)
  Howard's Conan lived life. His actions,swift and brutal;his lustiness almost without measure; a ""Blood red haze"" didn't swim before his eyes because he was the village idiot(like the '80s versions.) He ate and drank all aspects of life like a starving man at a feast. And this is what the 2011 film captures: with its cast; its director;its photography;its costuming...even the music is better than I expected. Is it perfect? No. Duh. Movies are made by people and people are far from it. But Mamoa owns the part like Craig owns Bond. And the rest of the cast backs him up at every turn. If you've only seen it once( or worse,took a friend's advice and not seen it at all) give it a chance on dvd. It pays homage to almost every incarnation of the character and Mamoa is riveting to watch. And for less than 100 million dollars? In this day and age? Hell, it looks like it cost twice that much!
Finally,I can say, after almost forty years, I've seen the 'real' Conan on the screen! I just hope the spirit of my big brother was there to see it with me. Rick Garrett",1318118400,16,3331,4.646859083191851
4344609,4,B004EPYZTE,"I have waited a long time for this Conan movie and worried it would be another Red Sonja.  This movie exceeded my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  Sure it could be better, some of the dialog was horrible and they should have incorporated the mask better in the end (what was the point of the mask again...it takes an hour to resurrect someone and still doesn't make the wearer any stronger?  How will Conan think his way through this one...oh yah, hack up the guy wearing the mask), but overall it was a great Conan movie.  While the content strayed from R.E Howard's work, the feel was very much in keeping with his style...and so what if they want to tell a story of Conan's childhood.  Most people watching this movie have never read the books.  It gave Conan greater depth and made him more accessible to everyone.  Plus his birth was bad-ass; very worthy of Conan.  Early in the movie when he went running off into the woods would have been an interesting time to work in the Frost Giant's Daughter story, but killing four picts before puberty was fine also.  What is most important in a Conan story is that there is never an ending.  He is always moving on to the next adventure.  I like the parallels between the original Conan the Barbarian movie and this remake.  Some of it is overt, such as the making of the sword, the pict raid and the thief character.  Others are more subtle such as the wheel motif.  They tried to incorporate a good soundtrack into the movie, but it is hard to beat the original.  If you like Conan, this is worth seeing.

4344611,4,B004EPYZTE,"So this is it, after 30 years it's the long awaited Conan - remake! Since I am a fan of the novels, comics and - of course - the 1982 - Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, it's almost impossible not to be disappointed. The task of satisfying all the Conan - fans out there is a hard one, for this new feature will be measured by the rich Conan - background - literature (a), the old Conan - movies (b) and all the other barbarian films out there (c).

Starting with the Conan - universe (a) this new movie is quite true to the spirit of it. The whole movie is more like an adventure film of old, just as the novels were. The locations pictured in this feature look like some of the sights from the classic comics and even Jason Momoa seems to be the comic - Conan come to life. Great cast!
On the other hand the world of Hyperborea pictured in the novels and comics was one of many different places and people. Part of it was jungle, part of it was desert, wood, ice and so on. And there were many different cultures, such as mongols, beduins or native tribes. And Conan - he produced his own kind of ""clash of civilisations"" by wandering this world and smashing some skulls, always staying true to his Cimmerian nature.
All this range of locations and people was lost to this new movie. There is little variety of climatic zones and only few different people are shown. So a great deal of the world of hyperborea is not pictured at all.

Let's look at the original movie from 1982 (b). The new Conan - feature quotes it in some places, starting with the ""riddle of steel"" and the progress of forging a sword, that is pictured incorrect in both movies by the way.
But while the old movie directed by John Milius had a very strong presence and created an unique atmosphere, power and suspence, the remake lacks all of this. Visually this new movie is rather disappointing.
Besides that, the classic movie had a fantastic soundtrack by Basil Poledouris, that was reused in one of the trailers for Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" some years ago (before it was relaced by Hans Zimmer great tracks). I have never heard a more fitting soundtrack for this kind of movie in all my life. The music from the new film does not come close to it. It does not even seem to have different themes, at least I don't remember any.

Besides that the original movie had great props, that looked like real swords - in some scenes they even used real swords to do the fighting, that were hand crafted by master - smith Jody Samson. The cast was trained by a japanese sword master for several months. Using swords made of steel is very dangerous, and some fingers were nearly chopped off in the 80s.
But this new Conan - swords look like plastic toys. They are awfull. I wonder if the designers of this new swords have ever seen a real one in a museum or such. This is not the way a sword looks or should look like. They should be elegant and not this chunky.

If one does speak of the original movie one has to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Earl Jones. It is nearly impossible to come up with someone better to play Conan or his opponent. Well, Jason Momoa does an incredible job. I was very pleased by his performance, great body, good action and great screen presence. It was a wise decission to choose someone looking like Conan and not someone looking like Arnold.

But besides that the new movie lacks philosophy. Philosophy? Yes, it lacks it. Perhaps some people missed this part about the classic movie, but it is full of quotes from Nietzsche. This whole ""riddle of steel"" - thing and this ""what does not kill You makes You stronger"" are the key elements to the story. The climatic conclusion of the movie, the confrontation between the charismatic James Earl Jones, who was so lovingly pictured as ""Bleeding Gums Murphy"" in ""the Simpsons"" and who gave Darth Vader his voice, and Arnold, is a cinematic masterpiece. And it is not predictable at all by the way. While Thulsa Dooms seeks to control the steel through the mind of the ones wielding it, Conan the Barbarian can not be controlled and will be a king himself one day, controlling others. He already has understood the riddle. Great.

And the new movie? There is Stephen Lang as the bad guy, who already is some kind of king, who wants to be more powerfull, but it's not clear why. For he already is feared and powerfull and all that. Why he is pulling a ship across the desert - no one knows, and nobody cares. Is he some kind of ""Fitzgeraldo""? For sure he is no James Earl Jones. Perhaps he could have been - but the script does not leave him enough room to proove it. Lang has the physics and does a decent job, so it is not his fault that the villain stays rather pale, it's the script that has no idea how to put this right.

The ""riddle of steel"" is nothing but a quote from the classic movie and has no influence on the film, no philosophy, no magic. Besides that - there is too much talk in this new movie. Not by Conan, but by the ""evil"" guys who tell You every minute that they will be powerfull soon and that they are very evil and ruthless and... You get the picture.
James Earl Jones just used his deep deep voice - and one understood instantly that he is very dangerous. But is he bad? Is he evil? Can a man with this voice and this pleasing gaze be bad? Oh, yes he can.... In the beginning of the classic movie as Conans village is burned down - there is no talk. Just picture and music, that grip You and pull You into the savage world of Hyperborea.
At least the idea of showing young Conan's training is a nice touch to the new movie. Besides that the story of the old movie is way better. It was all about survival and revenge in a savage world without frontiers free to explore and exploit. The new movie could also have been one episode out of ""Xena the warrior princess"".

Let's look at all the other barbarian movies out there (c.): ""Pathfinder"" is a movie done by the same director as the new Conan movie and it has the same flaws. ""Scorpion King"" is just about the same as this new Conan flick but has less violence.
But the masterpiece ""300"" is visually stunning and intense - the Conan remake can not put up with that. I wonder why the remake is not more like this Zack Snyder movie, it would have been for the better.

In the end I like the new Conan movie after all, and I would watch a couple more of them if Jason Momoa is in them. But after 30 years one would have expected movies to have become better than the old ones, to have evolved and grown. But I fear the classic Conan movie can hardly be improved or bettered. The world certainly has not waited for this kind of remake. There's already a couple of films out there that are better or at least as good. But watching the 2011 - Conan is still a nice way of spending some time.",1315526400,33,6810,4.3140625

If you are a fan of the REH books and comic series, you will love this rendition of Conan. J. Mamoa is as described in the books , not some dumb sounding idiot as in the older movies. To many people are expecting this to be a remake it is NOT, it is a REBOOT of a franchise. Too many haven't read the books and know the feel of them to get it. Watch it and enjoy.

4344613,4,B004EPYZTE,"Since this 2011 film is a remake/reboot of the '82 version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/0783241895/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>&nbsp;I'll draw comparisons throughout this review.

Although the film's set-up is the same as the '82 version -- raiders destroy Conan's Cimmerian village and thus the barbarian seeks revenge -- the ensuing story is completely different. The villains here are Khalar Zym and his witchy daughter, Marique, who seek to resurrect Zym's sorcerous wife, once they attain the needed pure blood necessary for their Acheron magic (or something to this effect).

WHAT WORKS:

- Jason Momoa, as Conan, is excellent. Far better than Arnie. It's hard to conceive of a better Conan.
- The Bulgarian locations are outstanding.
- The Costuming is more convincing than the '82 version. Conan's apparel, for instance, is more faithful to REH than Arnie's fur loincloth.
- Better acting than the '82 version, excluding James Earl Jones, of course.
- Brutal, thrilling action throughout.
- Convincing swordplay.
- Corsairs, highlighted by Conan's comrade Artus, effectively played by likable Nonso Anozie.
- Excellent sets/props. It definitely looks like the Hyborian Age.
- Good serious vibe, despite the cartooney, over-the-top last act.
- Rose McGowan as the witchy daughter is ee-vil and creepy.
- Ron Perlman as Conan's father is outstanding.
- The whole opening sequence.
- I liked how the film stressed the closeness and love of Conan and his father. There's a correlation between true greatness and a close relationship with a strong father-figure and his example of excellence.
- You have to give credit to the filmmakers for effectively illustrating Conan's youthful days and life in a Cimmerian village in general, something Conan's creator never delved into in any detail.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

- Deviated from Robert E. Howard, albeit not as much as the '82 version. Regardless, it certainly adhered to REH's overall pulp vibe. I'd prefer to see one of REH's originals put to film, like ""A Witch Shall be Born"" or ""Beyond the Black River.""
- Stephan Lang as Zym makes a worthy enough villain for Conan, but he comes off too cliched and cartoony, especially in the final act. James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom worked better, likely because he was so unique.
- Rachel Nichols' Tamara is solid as the female protagonist, but she doesn't hold a candle to Sandahl Bergman's Valeria.
- The score is serviceable but pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris' score from the '82 version and ""Conan The Destroyer."" This score defintely won't be celebrated 30 years later like Basil's. Why didn't they just update Polerdouris' score?
- Too much ""Modern Blockbuster Syndrome"" that appeals to those with ADHD.
- Especially the over-the-top final act, which is way too comic booky. It's cartoony overkill, pure and simple. But, then again, it did bring to mind REH's ""Jewels of Gwahlur,"" so maybe it's not so far off the mark.
- The 3D format was interesting but unnecessary. Why do theaters burden films with this needless expense?
- The biggest flaw was that there wasn't enough depth. The film needed more 'downtime' to contrast the wall-to-wall action, like campfire scenes (which would better indicate distances), more camaraderie on the ship, more development of Conan & Tamara's relationship, etc. Although it had some of this, it wasn't enough. Action sequences naturally hold more weight when the audience cares about the characters. As it is, it's clear that the filmmakers wanted to make an action flick above all else and this weakens the film.
- Along with lack of depth was the lack of epic-ness or moving moments. The '82 film deviated from REH but at least it made up for it with depth and epic-ness. For instance, when Conan & Subotai make their stand against the riders of doom or Conan's moving victory salute, not to mention the potent love & death/funeral scenes, etc. This 2011 version had glimpses of this, like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conan's father expresses his love with his final act, but -- again -- it needed more.

The film runs 113 minutes.

THE DVD: I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie slightly more on non-3D DVD. Need I point out that the cover of the DVD is Conan to a 't'? The extras include a director's commentary (Marcus Nispel), a commentary with Momoa and McGowan, a 12-minute feature on REH, a slightly longer one on the character of Conan, and a couple of features on the action scenes.

CONCLUSION: The filmmakers got a lot of things right, like Momoa as Conan and the authentic look/feel of the Hyborian Age. The film's not bad at all and pulsates with energy, but it needed more depth, epic-ness and uniqueness to pull it out of its ""blockbuster"" mediocrity. It's violence for the sake of violence, which gets dull by the 90-minute mark, plus the last act is just cartooney overkill. Here's hoping that there will be a future Director's Cut DVD with important character-defining moments that were needlessly cut for the theatrical release (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daredevil-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0002XVQNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daredevil (Director's Cut)</a>"" comes to mind).

UPDATE: I just finished my third viewing of the movie and, I have to say, I was entertained from beginning to end. Isn't this the most important factor when viewing a movie, particularly an action-adventure one? Yes, it lacks the epic-ness and magic of the '82 version; and its focus on wall-to-wall action limits the film's effectiveness, but it's still a very worthy Conan movie. It's serious and brutal, and -- thankfully -- lacks ""cute"" characters. It's certainly better than ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Destroyer/dp/0783225946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Destroyer</a>"" and leagues better than ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Sonja/dp/B0001Z37HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Sonja</a>"" and (rolling my eyes) ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kull-the-Conqueror/dp/0783225741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kull the Conqueror</a>.""

GRADE: Visually and action-wise, this is a Grade A adaption of Conan all the way, but storywise I'd give it a C+ or B-, even though it has a couple glimpses of greatness. Overall Grade: B",1314921600,266,6489,5.519114688128773
