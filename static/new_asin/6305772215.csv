1069133,3,6305772215,"""Alegria"", inspired by (but not the same as) the Cirque the Soleil show of the same name, is an attractive but unfortunately cliched story of love and hope.  A young boy, Momo, who is forced into virtual  slavery with other super-cute multi-national children, befriends a  down-and-out street performer named Frank.  Frank falls in love with  Julietta, the star of the ""Alegria"" show that happens to be  playing nearby.  Frank and Julietta's romance causes some upheaval in the  Cirque ranks, but in the end the two free the children from bondage,  re-unite Cirque, and everyone lives happily ever  after.
""Alegria"" the movie has the same beautiful visual style  and air of romance found in Cirque shows.  However, as a movie it fails in  many ways.  The plot is every bit as simple and obvious as described above.  Likely the creators of the movie wanted to tell a timeless fable, but  their execution is so heavy-handed and saccharine (especially in regards to  those too-cute children) that it's difficult to take the movie seriously.  Perhaps children and those who adore anything with cute kids will like it,  but I feel most discerning viewers will find it as disappointing as I  did.
If you absolutely love Cirque or super-cute kids, you may consider  getting this DVD anyways.  It's nice to see scenes from the  ""Alegria"" Cirque show (my favorite Cirque), the movie isn't so  bad that it's painful, and the DVD does have some nice extra features.  Note to one reviewer below -- I did review it as a movie and not as Cirque,  so please withhold rating a movie until after you've seen it.",957916800,11,1594,4.789667896678967
1069134,2,6305772215,"to reinstate other reviewers' comments, this is NOT a Cirque Du Soleil performance... it is a movie ~inspired~ by Alegria; however, i'm disappointed that this is the inspiration they came up with.
the story  could have worked the magical/mythical angle of joining the circus as a  child -- and the wonder this represents -- but instead the story is  dreary... more like children being sold into the circus; there isn't  anything etherial about the film -- it's just depressing (inspite of the  clown getting the girl).
there is almost none of the performances to  grace the movie (there are bonus materials which basically are extended  sequences of two 'performances') and -- here's the part that i felt cheated  of... the music rarely appeared. the great title song, Alegria, didn't turn  up until the VERY end and even then it was abridged!
i LOVE Cirque Du  Soleil (why i made the mistake of rushing out to buy it w/o looking at the  reviews) and this film captures none of the whimsy, wit, finesse or  atmosphere of the performances.
rent it and judge for yourself before  buying.",956793600,48,1085,4.8
1069135,5,6305772215,"I rate ""Alegria"" with five stars because it IS Cirque du Soleil and that in itself deserves this rating.  I also rate it high as my daughter and I enjoyed the story together, which is magic in its purist  form - we are both addicted to anything associated with Cirque du Soleil.  The film is probably not worthy of any academy awards (except for the  incredible soundtrack composed by the gifted Benoit Jutras), but it is a  feel-good movie even with the dark elements shown in the  ""Cauldron"" and the ""Flower Factory"" scenes.  Rene  Bazinet is a talented mime and proved that the role of Frac was perfect for  him. Giulietta's (played by Julie Cox) expressive eyes revealed sincerity  as she showed love for the lost soul of Frac.  I also recommend playing the  movie with director Franco Dragone's commentary as he explains how the sets  and characters evolved out surprising inspirations.  Cirque du Soleil once  again summons the world of children and adults and cultures together as  one.",955411200,30,993,4.78698224852071
1069136,5,6305772215,"First, this is not the circus show. If you're looking for one of those videos, try Nouvelle Experience, Saltimbanco, or Quidam. But be forewarned, no video can hope to capture the magic of the live shows.
That said, I  loved this movie. The main theme is  an interesting love story between a  street mime and a circus performer. That part was good, but what I really  liked was the peek inside the world of circus performers. The red carpet  scene was fantastic.
I've watched the video three times (once with  Franco's commentary) and will probably watch it several more times. If  you're a fan of Cirque and what they stand for, this is a must buy. If you  just want to watch a circus, look elsewhere.",953856000,8,702,4.515873015873016
1069137,5,6305772215,I am so glad that I bought this DVD.  It is so slow paced a movie that if I had rented it I would have turned it off and returned it without finishing watching it.  BUT once I got to the end I realized that it was  really a great movie.,953769600,4,236,3.588235294117647

I did not know that this was not the actual show, but a movie.  I was very disappointed.  Will  they ever release Alegria, the performance?  I sure hope so.",953510400,4,283,4.264150943396227
1069139,2,6305772215,"First, my disclaiming caveat:  I love Cirque Du Soleil; Alegria was the first one that I had seen live, so I had high hopes for this video.  I knew going in that this was a movie in it's own right, not a filming of a  performance.
As a film, I didn't much care for it.  The story took it's  time in developing and then moved slowly once it did.
There were some  circus performances, but just enough to get annoyed at them.  It made you  want to watch the performances, not the intercuts to the dialogue/'action'.  I can understand the desire to show off the performers and their rather  impressive talents, but the acrobatics so overshadowed the  plot/dialogue/acting that they could only suffer by comparison.
Other  notes:  The set design and costumes were sumptuous, up to the usual CDS  standards.",953251200,2,801,4.628571428571429

Don't buy it if you expect to see the wondrous acts and physical feats the Cirque folks are famous for. This is a genuine attempt at narrative and  it fails miserably. As a movie it's painful to watch and pretentious as  hell. And the few actual Cirque routines that are included are less than  stellar. You want Cirque? Buy Quidam.",953251200,7,409,4.285714285714286

Alegria, the movie, is a movie. I was breathless the entire moving watching the wonders of Cirque du Soleil. If you're reading this, that means that you probably like Cirque or know someone who does. I would recommend this movie to any Cirque fan!",953251200,4,494,4.25531914893617

She wad delighted when she opened it for it on Christmas day, we popped it in the dvd play and INSTANTLY I knew it wasn't the stage play I remembered from my childhood. Maybe it was just me being excited for the season and saw it for a cheap price, but I am so disappointed that I got her the wrong Alegria. I had to override my bank account just to get her the actual stage play that she wanted. The acting is terrible, the story is boning. WORST PRESENT EVER I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!",1482624000,2,636,4.096

The film blends together several disparate plotlines: a love story, child workplace exploitation, parental reluctance to allow an adult offspring to make their own decisions about life choices, and the dynamic relationship between the audience and the performer, set against the backdrop of a traveling circus show that comes to a small city that could be anywhere or anytime.",1446681600,,639,4.925925925925926

This is a movie, not the circus show on DVD.  It is about a clown, and a boy and a girl and love and fear.  I have never reviewed anything on Amazon before, but had too after reading some of the negative reviews.  The movie is not going to set Hollywood on fire with production value and big name stars.....  But if you have a child in your eyes and love in your heart it may just change the way you look at the world a bit.  It is dark at times and true to life, as are most Cirque shows.  It is full of magic and beauty that shines brightly against its own dark backdrop.  This movie inspired me to create a clown troupe and change my life completely in 2006. Still clowning to this day.  If you bring your imagination and an open heart you will see things that change your life too.  It only takes a spark... This movie is filled with sparks.  It begins with  ""If you have no voice scream, if you have no legs run, if you have no hope invent"", the rest of the movie follows that theme.  This movie is number one on my list of favorite movies, I've shared it with over 40 people (its part of my clown training process) I've seen it many many times and now I've reviewed it once",1340496000,,1351,4.106870229007634
1069692,5,6305772215,"I thought that this was a wonderful film. It clearly has dark elements and expresses the underside of humanity, but through love and lasting friendships, those trials can be overcome. I had first seen it on Netflix and liked it so much that I had to order a copy myself and have watched it at least twice since.

Rene Bazinet as Frac and Julie Cox as Giulietta have a wonderful chemistry together that gives them such a warm performance. The way they move has a lot of fluid grace and their interactions with the rest of the cast are very human and touching.

Before the changes, Amazon had a clearly listed a picture of this film which had the words ""Alegria: An Enchanting Fable"", as well as labeled the product itself as the same, brought to us from Cirque du Soleil. That picture seems to have been altered, but the fact remains that, no, this is not a video of the circus performances. It is a movie based on the storyline brought to life by the Alegria circus performance. There ARE some moments of the performers doing their routines in the movie but it's done in small bits.

Please take that into account before buying this product. By doing so, it saves on the negative reviews of a very good movie in my opinion.

As to all of the negative reviews that I've taken the time to read, the major theme among them is ""not as expected"". Unfortunately, those reviewers (not to offend) didn't seem to take the time to read other reviews first, or did not understand what it was that they were buying. In my opinion, giving the movie a negative review not based on the quality of the film itself but rather on their own error is unfair.

To those that read my review, please don't judge a movie based on expectation but by what you get from the movie itself. There are plenty of videos that you can preview this movie on youtube. To help find it, type in ""Julie Cox Alegria"". That will give you this movie's trailers and clips rather than the true cirque Alegria.

The negative reviews all reflect a deeply felt betrayal by fans (yes that's short for fanatic) of what Cirque has shown itself to be.

 The movie is told from the point of view of Momo, an older gentlmen telling a story to a group of circus performers. When he was a child, he was sold into slavery and forced to sell flowers to tourists. At night he and other children are locked up in a big warehouse, away from the sun and laughter and light.
 Momo's friend is Franc, a white-faced performer, who tries to end his life one night by lying down in front of an oncoming train. Momo sees this, and lies down next to Franc, forcing him to abandon his plan and save Momo. The train comes to a halt, and all manner of circus performers climb out, including Julietta, the singer and star of Alegria, the circus performance. Franc falls instantly in love, and tries to win Julietta's heart.
 As the two become close, Julietta's performance in the circus, which is run by her father, falters, and eventually she runs off to find Franc. Together the two of them manage to save the children, the circus, and the day, and find true love and happiness in each other.
 It's really a sweet, enjoyable movie, and not very similar to the Cirque du Soleil performance. There are small portions with the performers, but it's a love story and a movie more than a performance. It's probably not the best it could be, but if you're looking for something with good music, an interesting cast, and a happy ending, this is a good choice.",1081036800,2,1576,4.424137931034482

I love foreign films and have no problem with the dark aspect of the tale. Contrary to those who found it deep and moving, I found it a pretty superficial representation of the characters and their plight. As for actual circus stuff, the hoop girl is prominently featured on the cover- but my daughter did more demanding hoop tricks as a level five (beginning) rhythmic gymnast than the hoop girl does in the ""extended"" water special feature. Truly a frustrating experience ""waiting"" for the circus to begin.

1069864,3,6305772215,"This is a movie (not a Cirque du Soleil performance) about a despairing character who experiences love-at-first-sight with a young woman from a traveling circus. This man, Frac (played by professional mime Rene Bazinet; he talks), was just about to commit suicide by lying across railroad tracks. He's saved by child character Momo, the narrator of the film's story, but the train which just misses running over Frac is transporting a circus performer Giulietta (Julie Cox) and her colleagues, real members of Cirque's Alegria show. She comes to him, they gaze upon one another, and there's ... emotion. Trouble is, the train moves on before he can catch her name; thus, Frac spends the rest of the film stumbling (literally) into her stage shows in his lengthy quest to find out who she is. There's also a side plot involving a slave master who oversees a bunch of street urchins who bring in money by selling flowers. This ""modern urban fable"" has a thin plot, filled with coming-of-age cliches. When all was said and done, I found it rather predictable.
Acting kudos go to veteran Frank Langella, who played ""Fleur"" (Giulietta's father) and leant some great emotion and depth to the Cirque's stage master character. The Alegria cast was delightful, especially the clowns, and there were just enough visual treats (e.g., the excellent tumbling) to keep one watching.
Although Franco Dragone did an admirable job as director (he came up with the concept for the Alegria performance), his commentary was disappointingly bland, with too many long pauses between ideas, and far more philosophizing than recounting stories about how the movie was made.
The big hit(s) of this disc were the two ""extended"" (actually, under three minutes) scenes featuring the ""Hoops"" and ""Cube Act"" routines from the Alegria show. I've watched ""Hoops"" over and over, and continue to be amazed.
Other features include music videos, a trailer and a short piece on the making of the movie. All are good, but not great.

Considering that ALEGRIA is the name of one of their shows, and this film is NOT the stage performance (like SALTIMBANCO, or QUIDAM, for example), the title is misleading.  This is actually a narrative movie.  A BAD narrative movie.  This has an ambitious artistic drive, that reminds me of teh Andy Warhol movies of the 70s, which very very daring, but they were a mess.  This mess cannot be cleaned up.  It has as much to do with the stage version of ALEGRIA as DEEP THROAT has to do with Watergate.  I was so angry after seeing this film, I wanted my two hours back.

1069866,5,6305772215,"As many others here have previously stated, this is not the actual performance of Alegria (which is incredible, by the way). This is a full movie, a theatrical performance based on Alegria, hence the addition ""An Enchanting Fable"" on the cover, that contains a few snippets of performances from the show that were modified to advance the plot of this film. That said, do not buy this expecting to see a Cirque show, it is something much more, and in no way warrants a mere ""1 star"" from bitter people who didn't read the case and thought it was something else.
Alegria, the Film, is exactly as advertised; ""An Enchanting Fable"". This is not your typical Hollyword trash, it is deep, metaphorical, beautiful, and inspiring. The story is the typical love story you would expect full of discovery, strife, tragedy, and finally redemption. What distinguishes this film is the manner in which said love story is told. This is the world of Cirque du Soleil if it were not combined to merely the stage, this is the emotional essense of the acts we see, if they were part of the actual world. The movie is told in a slightly bent reality, everything is as it should be yet twisted in that typical Cirque style to highlight the emotional themes.
This is an intelligent movie, you won't get the full effect of it if you are unable to interpret its unspoken side; the subtle, unsaid elements including imagery and implied meanings in seemingly normal speech that. On this level, it is a simply amazing film, one of the best I've had the pleasure to view.
If you watch Cirque's live performances to be wowed and dazzled by the acts this movie is not for you. However, if you watch them and enjoy the social commentaries and emotional messages buried within the live shows' themes, this is a must buy. This movie takes the emotional theme the shows, and puts them in a living breathing world with people represented by Cirque characters that could easily be you or anyone you know at a given stage of life.
This is not the live show, but something truely inspired by it that keeps the one of the meanings of that performance alive: Life does goes on, no matter what, and you must go with it.
It is simply a beautiful film.",1034640000,10,2209,4.566750629722922

Instead a clumsy ""story"" is grafted on to its delicate artistry, set in an unconvincing ""real"" world which blurs rather than expands the boundaries of Cirque Du Soleil.
By introducing new characters far less compelling than the original stage stars (what must they have made of this betrayal?), Dragone seems to have decided to ""explain"" Alegria's purpose. This is like explaining a joke - the result falls flat, its poetry and clarity of purpose are muddied - or worse, articulated by characters not so much conversing as making speeches to each other. Thus the skills of a mime of genius like Rene Bazinet are fatally compromised.
One of the strengths of the show Alegria was that its language was that of athletic and balletic grace, equisite mime and haunting music. There was no dialogue, which freed it from political boundaries. This is why the show was a huge international hit and this movie was not.
Here the engaging grotesques are firmly separated from ourselves, the audience. The twilight magical world we thought they occupied is revealed to be the cheap side of town. They speak dialogue with little wit or poetry. There is a half hearted attempt to design a skewed reality outside the Big Top but the magic is overwhelmed by a welter of bad ideas and sugary emotion and lovers of Alegria the show are underwhelmed as a result.
Truly this should not have been released under the same title.",979430400,14,1683,4.888111888111888

For those of you wish to protect yourselves & or your children from a story of imagination, love, wit, charm,innocense, humanity, self discovery, hope, music, magic & bravery,  set in a world with no particular time reference, which is NOT IMPORTANT at all, then don't watch it. Stick to your to your Barney the Dinosaur videos in the comfort of your bubblegum scented reality-proof bomb shelters.  I love this movie for all the reasons I listed above, I found it to be a wonderful exploration & discovery of the many faces & consequences of life & love between friends, a man and a woman, & a father & his child. And best of all in the end there is no moral preaching...only a simple philosphy.  ALL the CAST did an EXECELLENT JOB in their performances, it was great to see Frank Langella play an emotional parental role, instead of some cheesey villian in some american b-movie.  Rene, Julie & Clipper did an wonderful job of painting their characters with all the textures of life a person can & will experience...regardless of the age factor.",978048000,3,1143,4.583333333333333
1070074,5,6305772215,"You could cut up any scene in this movie and make a poster of pure magic.  I haven't seen the stage show so I am not going to compare this with it.  The combination of art, colour, mime and performing skills of the people involved in this is beyond articulation.  It really is something that everybody should sit down and watch when life gets a bit dull and mechanical.  Great music and something I'll be showing my daughter when she gets a bit older. I think the previous negative comments are rather misleading and possibly based upon the super-fantastic memories of the live performance, which one day I hope to experience: buy it and live!",969753600,5,643,4.565217391304348

IT IS A FILM WITH A SILLY STORY SO INCONSEQUENTIAL, UNBELIEVABLE, AND NONSENSICAL THAT IT WILL APPEAL NEITHER  TO ADULTS, CHILDREN, NOR THEIR PETS. THE CASTING IS ATROCIOUS: THE MAIN  CHARACTERS ARE UNAPPEALING (EXCEPT FOR THE FEMALE LEAD)INCLUDING A MISCAST,  HOPELESSLY OVERWEIGHT FRANK LANGELLA.

1070078,5,6305772215,"I am disappointed with the reviews listed for this movie.  While most of them hold valid perceptions and opinions of the movie, they fail to convey the meaning and spirit behind the movie.
Perhaps the story is simple, but the undertones are complex and subtle.  I purchased the DVD on the day it  became available, and I am still seeing something new every time.  It is a  timeless story of pain, love, loss and unity.
Rene Bazinet performs  spectacularly in this movie, with facial expressions that can tell the  story without words.  Julie Cox performs as a confused woman who has to  choose between the man she loves and her father.  Frank Langella tells the  story of a man who performs the show as a method to keep his daughter on  his shoulders for just a little bit longer.
Although the movie is not a  film of the performances in Biloxi, MI (soon to be closed, October 2000),  most of the characters reprise their roles from the stage show.  Throughout  the entire movie, the characters never sway from their roles, never once to  become ""like them"".  If you look closely, you will even see a  guest appearance by Whoopi Goldberg, but you will have to discover which  part she plays for yourself.
The cast and crew of Alegria retell a  classic story, and they do so by integrating their roles from the stage  show into the story line.  With the combination of sights and sounds, the  movie can leave you with a feeling of awe.  The characters' stage  performances interweave so tightly into the movie that it is easy to miss  some of the performers acting out their parts exactly as they have in the  past.
This movie is an artistic representation of an old story with new  characters and new ideas.  Although we have all seen and heard the story  that is played out in the plot before us, Alegria manages to make us want  more, to expect more.  The characters make it so easy to fall into their  world and forget about your own.  The dreams that are played out on your  screen before you, the stories of someone else's life, is the goal behind  Fleur's show.  ""Fleur comes to understand that the mission of the circus is  to console a suffering world, to invite the audience, like the performer,  to step forward across an imaginary line separating darkness from the  light. The show, like life, must go  on.",959126400,8,2317,4.537712895377129
1070079,4,6305772215,"One of my favorite photographs is of a little old lady walking with cane, eating a huge cone of cotton candy. ""Alegria"" reminds me of that photo: in a dreary world, there is cotton candy and the joy of a moment  which is beautiful, engaging, filled with awareness.
No, the plot isn't  much.  And no, the dialogue is pretty mundane at times (""How do you  feel?"" ""Happy and sad at the same time."" ""That means  you're in love"".) But what is captivating is the allegory and the  symbolism: the constant interplay between real and fantasy, between good  and bad, between love and loneliness, between childhood and maturity,  between good and evil.
To experience this, one has to be able to accept  the film in and of itself: the music, the cinematography, the narrative  sequence. No, it's not a stage performance, and no it isn't a 'movie'. It  is a complete and unified emotional and artistic experience, and it's  wonderful.",958262400,6,922,4.729559748427673
