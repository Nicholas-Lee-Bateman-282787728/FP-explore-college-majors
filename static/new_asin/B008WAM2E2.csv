5186747,5,B008WAM2E2,"I saw this movie available on-demand and decided to take the chance.  It was well-worth the rental!  If you are into horror films that are disturbing with great twists, then this is a perfect choice.  I was creeped-out for a couple of days after.  The performances are awesome and the music is great!",1338595200,3,300,4.60377358490566
5186748,5,B008WAM2E2,"This movie had me chewing my fingernails off!  It is a genuine horror flick in that the writing and style genuinely scare you, without needing to be a huge budget film. The detractor on here seems like s/he hasn't seen the actual movie. The ending got me just fine!  If you're a film fan, and genuinely enjoy horror (which doesn't rely on overdone special effects - think Blair Witch-esque - not in style, but in scaring the pants off of you without costing a fortune to make), rent this. You'll love it!",1338595200,7,504,4.467391304347826
5186749,4,B008WAM2E2,"This movie is eerie, suspenseful and has an ending I didn't see coming.

Another poster commented that ""an ending that has been done to death""...really?  I don't remember any other movies with an ending quite like this one.

As long as you rent this not expecting big budget special effects, if you like creepy movie you'll be satisfied.",1338508800,32,337,4.775862068965517
5186750,1,B008WAM2E2,"Predictable, cliched and not scary.  If you're a fan of horror movies, you've seen every bit of this film before -- in other horror movies that were way better.  Even the ending is an idea that's been done to death.  I can see why this is available before it hits theaters.  Once it's out there and reviewed, no one will rent it.",1338163200,4,329,4.258064516129032
5186751,4,B008WAM2E2,"So hard to find a good scary movie without all the excess blood, gore, and torture.  This had great suspensful moments, with haunted house aspects.  I liked it a lot.",1337990400,4,166,4.5
5186752,4,B008WAM2E2,"Sometimes, less is more.

The Pact seriously creeped me out. I was expecting something in the supernatural mother/child horror categories, but what I got was different from what I expected on many levels. Yes, there is family dysfunction. But the maternal relationship is not directly addressed, except in a couple of scenes that made me wonder whether some material had been cut.

Nevertheless, I liked this movie, including its mostly unknown cast and Casper Van Dien doing the best acting I have ever seen him do. It's creepy, rather than terrifying; a slow reveal, maybe even with some pacing issues. But all things considered, the film is very worth watching.

Bottom line: I saw this with my Shudder subscription. I would pay to rent it but probably would not watch it more than a couple of times.",1478217600,6,803,4.846715328467154

5186755,5,B008WAM2E2,"This movie terrified me on all levels with the mood and set up of the character's being thrown into a horrific mystery. The cinematography was spot on and the conclusion was a nail-biter until the last shot.

One of the best horror films that I have seen in the last ten years.",1460505600,,277,4.326923076923077
5186756,1,B008WAM2E2,"Two gorgeous blondes have a bad childhood with an overly aggressive mother - one is a responsible mother and the other the ""rebel"" who rides a motorcycle. Mother goes missing after hearing some strange things in her house. Rebel sister comes to visit to help make arrangements for the mother's funeral, and the house is empty. She comes across her cousin at said funeral (which like two people actually go to.. obviously nobody cares about this mother character) who is now looking after the responsible sister's daughter. Cousin (names don't matter here) now disappears after they all three spend the night at the house (rebel, cousin, and kid daughter... the kid daughter being the only non-blonde by the way). Movie then becomes focused solely on hot rebel blonde, her nice cleavage, gorgeous face, and hot scenes walking around in her tight underwear. Supernatural occurrences start happening... like her being literally thrown around the house by an evil spirit. We do not yet know what this spirit is. Rebel goes to the police and Captain Johnney Rico (Starship Troopers) is the designated token cop.... and the only cop in the office who says anything at all. This gives a clue to one of the movie's biggest problems - no scope. If nobody cares why should the audience?

A little investigation that goes nowhere and Rebel seeks the help from a medium and discovers some strange things about the past and some spirit in the house, yadda  yadda you've seen it before. It turns out a strange man serial killer is hiding out in some hidden room in the house. Things eventually culminate when serial killer captures Rebel. Climactic scene and of course the good guy wins, yadda yadda, you've seen it before. Now it turns out Rebel is now taking care of little daughter kid girl... who strangely enough has YET to show ANY emotion whatsoever about both her missing mother AND missing aunt who was taking care of her before. This little girl must be mentally handicapped because she just doesn't seem to care at all all these women who have disappeared from her life. The film has no interest whatsoever in providing ANY characterization whatsoever. It seems nobody in this movie cares about anyone else, really. At least not in an emotional sense. Sure, Rebel is investigating, but no tears, no grief, nothing. I mean, if she doesn't care, if the kid doesn't care, why should I? Rebel is just there to look gorgeous, and kid is just there to be smiley cute kid.

Personally I'm sick of all the positive reviews this movie has gotten because it is completely undeserved. All reviews coming from stupid white dudes who think if they compliment it enough they might catch the attention of Rebel blonde actress or something. The movie's pace is INCREDIBLY and UNNECESSARILY slow, and barely anyone ever speaks and no real exposition is given. The film relies solely on Rebel's beauty because it seems the cameraman is obsessed with closeups and capturing her cleavage in sexy angles. This is very apparent in the scene where she's walking around in her underwear. Captain Johnney Rico cop serves NO purpose whatsoever except to be the token cop, because all these movies REQUIRE a token cop who doesn't believe the protagonist because, spirits and ghosts, etc yadda  yadda. His time is short-lived in the film and he accomplishes absolutely nothing. Nothing whatsoever. The WORST part of this film is the incredible amount of plot holes AND lack of closure on ANYBODY. We NEVER find out what happens to any of these missing people, we never find out anything about anyone's past, we never find out WHO this serial killer was, and we never find out HOW and WHY he was hiding out in the house for all this time or anything about HIS past all except that he was a serial killer. Worst off, we NEVER found out ANYTHING about the house spirits, who they are, why they care, and absolutely NOTHING about the mother, who is the entire reason why all this crap is happening in the first place! Unbelievable!

Again, this movie is solely focused on showing us Rebel and all her gorgeous features - nice sweeping blonde hair, different colored pretty eyes, cute freckles, nice lips, beautiful cleavage, fit athletic body, gorgeous butt and legs. etc. The fact that she NEVER says anything that doesn't directly have to do with the film's exposition just goes to show she has NO PERSONALITY WHATSOEVER. She is BORING. The film's pace is slow and the ending clue to a sequel is totally forced and makes no sense whatsoever.

Do not watch this film. It's not even bad in a fun or funny way, it's simply a borefest that holds no meaning and you'll want to watch something directly afterward to wash the taste out of your mouth. A total waste of my 90 minutes.",1455494400,3,4742,4.755771567436209

5186776,5,B008WAM2E2,"One of the FEW low-budget independent movies I have ever given five stars. It was THAT well crafted. This is not your conventional ghost story. If you have not yet read any spoilers, DON'T. You owe it to yourself to watch this without knowing anything about it.

The plot circles around a woman who inherited her dead mother's house. Soon after moving in to deal with all the paperwork and possessions, it becomes apparent that the house is also home to an evil presence. One that actually terrified me once I learned the truth of what happened there.

This is a purchase movie and I plan to get it as soon as I can.",1416355200,,616,4.394736842105263
5186777,1,B008WAM2E2,"Truthfully, it takes much to elicit a response, positive or negative, and seldom does something move me to resort to pen and paper [uh-oh, a sign that I am old enough to be considered one of the tribal elders] to make my opinion or observations heard.  This film, however, has done all of that and more.
At its end [was that the end?] The Pact left me open-mouthed, stunned, perhaps outraged, all these would be appropriate descriptors for this opus.  I wanted to search my soul, desperately trying to find the ""Guiding Intelligence"" [yes, that is an oxymoron] manifest in this film. I used an electron microscope, a gas spectrometer, oh, I'd have gone further, but when you become totally dismayed and discouraged, one surrenders at that point.
This is one of those productions that leaves the audience asking, ""Why did I spend this this time and money?  Who made the decision to produce this petard?""
Even using a modest budget, I know that film making is a very costly process involving many many individuals before the ""finished product"" materializes.  But, this picture I regret to say, could have saved everyone time, effort, and operating capital by just deciding not to make it.  I hate to be so negative because I have always valiantly attempted to praise another's efforts.  But unfortunately, this is not one of those moments.

The Pact had some good suspense, and I didn't know what direction the film was headed, which is rare for me. Thereare a couple of questions I wanted answered, but I am not going to post any spoilers here. This was a good independent suspense thriller.

5186781,2,B008WAM2E2,"This movie was a little bit all over the place for me. The viewer is expected to do a lot with a little. There were a lot of independent stories like the relationship between the mother and the daughters? What exactly happened to the mother? Why does the movie's description mention that ""the sisters return to their childhood home to pay their respects..."" when I don't think I ever saw Nichole.

This was a collection of small stories put together into one. The best thing I could say, about this movie, is that there was an interesting surprise that had very little back story and no real build up. I don't regret watching this movie but I just wish I didn't have such high hopes.",1413590400,,683,4.464
5186782,4,B008WAM2E2,"This is a GREAT example of a low-budget indie horror flick -- spooky, creepy, AND intelligent.  The feel is very much like some of the better supernatural thrillers to come out of Japan (e.g., ""Ring-u"").  In fact, I would say that ""The Pact"" is the CLOSEST implementation of the Japanese horror genre that I've seen in a Western-made film (far more than the direct adaptations like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge,"" with their bigger budgets, bigger casts, and their perceived need to just be, well, bigger).  The movie relies much more on mood and atmosphere to generate its chills, with a few ""jump"" moments thrown in to keep one guessing.

Caity Lotz is an as-yet undiscovered treasure, and does a great job as the protagonist.  All of the other actors were also consistently good.  When did Casper Van Dien become a likable and low-keyed older actor (LOL)?

At under six bucks, I HAD to add this film to my DVD library.",1413504000,,918,4.6645962732919255

I image that the post production team had a lot to do with ""the Pact's"" appeal.  It was seamless.  There was no need for lengthy explanation or character development, it flowed right into it's glorious ending.  The script, direction, and acting, were all top shelf.

It's a slow build of terror and suspense, which makes the scares all the better.  Not your typical blood and guts, slasher movie; this is a nice psychological scare.  There is a bit of supernatural in it, but the true horror is that a human being can be so cruel and deviant.  Like someone else noted, there were some minor holes in the plot along the way, but not big enough to truly detract from the overall story, nor enough to suspend the viewer's believability in the tale.

5186821,4,B008WAM2E2,"A massive flood of negative ""reviews"" (which mostly resembled something like a pouty-lipped child calling an adult a ""poopy-head"") attempted to persuade me away from experiencing-- and ultimately enjoying --this unique movie for myself with an open mind! (This seems to be becoming something of a habit.)

The first time I'd even learned anything about the existence of this movie was from the repeated mention of it in the DVD ""commentary track"" of the movie, ""Sinister,"" but it was not until I'd listened to the commentary again during a follow-up viewing that I decided to put it on my to-do list for later. Despite the positive feedback from the commentary track, I was still not anticipating much from The Pact, and my interest waned even further as I read brief synopses and ultimately saw just how many people were kicking this movie in the gonads as though it were the dullest, most convoluted waste of time in movie history.

As seems typical nowadays, many of the complaints revolved around the movie being ""too slow to get scary"" or that the story was somehow ""hard to follow"" and left more questions than answers. Really? Then I must have been the only one who was still awake and paying attention throughout the entire film... maybe because I actually enjoy and appreciate ""horror/thriller"" type movies which actually don't try to throw everything in our faces all at once just for cheap shock-value, but actually want us to do a little bit of ""thinking"" along the way. I had NONE of the problems so many have complained about: for instance, I can posit a reasonable explanation as to why the paranormal entity would interact with and affect one person and not another, and I can even understand the significance of the film's title as it relates to the story. As far as any ""bait-&-switch"" with the preview trailer suggesting one type of movie and delivering something else entirely I can only claim justifiable ignorance as I've yet to see any trailers for this movie. So had it not been for the fact that I'd been able to view this movie before hand, I just might never have purchased this title for my private library on the strength of so many people claiming to have had so many problems with it.

I've since learned that this movie was the full-length feature debut of the writer/director Nicholas McCarthy who has presented a number of short films (including the earlier version of this title) which I've not seen, but apparently he's skilled enough and has made enough of an impact to regularly have his work become ""official selections"" at Sundance, the gold standard of film festivals.

Although, granted, the movie was not exactly a ""scare-fest,"" that was actually part of what made it all the more enjoyable for me! I mean, some of us do get tired of the same old regurgitated pap that frequently makes our typical horror/thriller movies so frustratingly annoying... which is why most of the American remakes of the ""Asian Horror Wave"" movies met with overwhelmingly bland reception and critical dismissiveness, because the reimaginers kept forgetting that what made the those horror films from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, etc. so appealing to the western audiences who had the opportunity to experience them in the first place was that they did break with convention and actually constructed real stories with real tension & uneasiness and were not just overloaded with a bunch of random or convenient jump scares. I admittedly was upset that even this film went the way of giving us the clich&eacute;d ""Boo! The threat's not over!"" scene tacked on at the very end... but chalk it up as just another one of those ""Carrie White Burns In Hell"" type dream sequences and forget about it, and everything will be fine.",1395878400,3,3736,4.841940532081377

There were a few gotcha moments that failed to get me (sorry I'm jaded I guess). Though what it lacks in scares it makes up for in damn good story telling (if you can get past some of the holes). The character development isn't great but good enough to make you care about the protagonists well being. And that little fact is what gives you the biggest scare in the movie.

I was left with so many more questions than I was chills that it actually got in the way of my movie-watching experience... I even asked aloud ""Are you kidding me?"" as I watched.  What exactly does the notions of a 'pact' have to do with ANYTHING in this film?? It seemed to be mostly about a chick with very manly hands from a moderately dysfunctional family (though, who nowadays isn't?) who makes a few dumb decisions and 'miraculously' makes it out alive. There were so many segments that were so dark I couldn't see what was going on that I questioned if the movie had stopped playing until I heard noise... The acting was below par in my opinion - at least for a few characters... oh, wait... there only WERE a FEW characters. That little girl NAILED IT!
I did not enjoy the storyline - I feel that it left far too much unexplained and did not serve to make the overall composition any better. The general premise of the film could be done better and more effectively, but there are many tweaks necessary before this squab is ready to fly.

I was not expecting much when I started watching this and it completely held my attention.  There are holes in the plot... there is no ""pact"" that I noticed and I might have preferred a different ending but overall it was genuinely creepy with some great camerawork and just enough surprises.

I did enjoy the movie, but it didn't really provide much in the way of genuine scares for me.  It was not what I expected from the description.  Sisters sense a presence in their mother's house, but the sisters apparently are estranged and are not in the house together.  Ok, not an incorrect description but definitely misleading as I expected that they would actually spend time together in the house.  I don't have any problems with the pace of the movie.  I prefer more of a buildup rather than a ""slap you in the face immediately"" movie, and this delivered on that respect.  But I expected a bit more from a paranormal aspect.  It meandered a bit in the middle of the movie, leaving a lot for the viewer to figure out.  Several people commented on confusion over the name of the movie...my take is that the pact was between the abusive mother and her brother, whom she sheltered while being aware that he was a serial killer possibly even enabling him with the murders.  Overall a decent movie, if a bit sterotypical with some of the characters, but it's one I'm glad I didn't pay for (free with Amazon Prime).

5186933,4,B008WAM2E2,"The Pact is a slow burning modern horror film with quite a bit of spooky moments.
In this day and age, good horror films are a rarity, and to find one with an actual story is even more rare. this film is well made, with interesting plot, and likeable characters. The characters feel like real people and easy to relate to. The plot is pretty easy to follow, with a few twists thrown in.

the film can be scary at times, but this a much more mature horror film that doesn't depend on gore and nudity to sell it. In fact, this film has neither in it. It is a haunting tale that people with patience will surely enjoy.

The film isn't a rollrcoaster ride, filled with shocking moments. It is dialog heavy, serious film. At times, the film really slows down to a crawl, but there are always interesting developments to keep you going.

All in all, I would easily recommend The Pact to anybody who is looking for a creepy film without cheap scares, gore, and super violence just for the sake of violence. Take your time with this one, and you will be glad you did.",1376611200,,1059,4.311557788944723

5186936,4,B008WAM2E2,"If you're a fan of the horror genre and can take ""The Pact"" at face value, then you will absolutely enjoy it.  There is no denying that there are more plot holes than an old-fashioned piece of swiss cheese, but I didn't care that much because the ambience of the movie is just so good.

The entire movie is essentially set inside a house the decor of which hasn't been updated since the 1970s.  It doesn't seem strange that the house is so poorly lit 90% of the time -- instead that seems perfectly fitting with the drab interior design.  Thanks to some excellent camera work, I never got a good feel for the floor plan of the house and was frequently disoriented, which adds tension at some of the film's most intense moments.  I also found the use of sound very effective; instead of creepy music occurring right before something horrifying is about to happen, there is often no scoring at all.  This also works well to heighten the tension because without musical cues, the scary stuff is much more surprising.

In terms of the plot, even though clues are revealed from the beginning, I wasn't able to figure things out until pretty much when I was supposed to -- which is saying a lot considering how transparent horror movies tend to be and how many horror movies I've seen.  ""The Pact"" boasts kind of an original story.

The rub is, the story is the weakest point.  It really only makes sense at the most cursory level.  A woman who it's reaveled to the audience was a relgious zealot passes away and her estranged daughter (Nichole) is staying at the house to take care of the arrangements; it takes some coaxing to get the woman's other estranged daughter (Annie) there for the funeral and by the time she does show up, Nichole is missing.  Then someone else goes missing from the house and it's up to Annie to solve the mystery of why the house and what goes on in it is so confoundingly creepy.  Along the way Annie is aided by a handsome detective, a ghost, and a girl she knew from high school who has the ability to communicate with the ""other side.""  That's really all there is to it -- except the explanation for the creepy house turns out to be pretty darn creepy.

There's a lot that's never explained and/or just doesn't add up.  For one, high school didn't happen that long ago for Annie, which is sort of problematic since the atomosphere of the past she's exploring screams 1970s or maybe early 1980s, when in reality it was like early 1990s.  It's kind of strange that a woman as fanatically religious as Nichole and Annie's mother had two children out of wedlock.  In terms of mother/daughter relations, there are elements that overtly echo the Stephen King story ""Carrie,"" but these elements are never addressed forthrightly enough to be made sense of.  Annie ends up with things in her possession that the audience never sees get into her possession (e.g., a floor plan of the house).  I can't discuss too much about the story's deficits without giving away too much period, but suffice it to say, there's a lot left to assume and forgive here.

I think a lot of the questionable plot points are there to throw the audience off track and that's why I can forgive them -- because the movie works as a horror movie if not as a great piece of writing.  There's tension, there's mystery, and there are surprises.  Is it going to go down as one of the all-time greats?  No.  But it fits the bill if you're looking for a satisfyingly scary movie.",1376179200,,3465,4.5056

5186981,1,B008WAM2E2,"This movie was lame with a capitol L. I watched it because for a horror movie it seem to have a decent rating and some of the reviews read well. To me it was a big waste of time. Either write a horror movie with a supernatural element or write a horror with a natural element i.e., a human serial killer, but for god sake don't mix them both up unless your writing is brilliant enough to sell it. In this movie the ghost of a the murder victim leads the main character Annie (played by Caity Lotz) to the ghost's human killer. In one scene, the unseen spirit ghost of the victim tosses Annie all around the house in order to get her attention and on the trail of the killer but later on when the killer freely roams around the house he seems to be immune to the supernatural tossing of his spirit victim. That is why I don't think mixing these to themes, the natural and the super natural, ever works. Because it would take extremely creative writing to convince the viewer why the murderer is not susceptible to the attacks of his spirit victim yet everyone else in the movie is.",1372636800,,1080,4.273170731707317

5187118,3,B008WAM2E2,"I have watched my share of all types of horror films, campy to low budget, gore horror to spook stories, but none is more chilling than the hybrid, classic ghost story mixed with a suspense thriller.

Annie is back in the house she grew up in. She is back only to bury her dead mother she has no love for, and bury the unhappy past along with it. When her sister, Nicole, and cousin, Liz, both go missing, and strange things begin happening in the house, Annie starts to investigate. What she discovers is beyond her imagining, what she learns about her family, nearly gets her killed.

The directing is pretty solid and exciting. The acting was good, credible and believable. The production was decent, great atmospheric music, and the setting is so typical suburbia, it's unsuspecting and that's what makes it all the more creepy. What works with this film is that it relies partly on supernatural, scare tactics as well as a bit of non-supernatural. There is no glitzy CGI, just good old fashioned camera tricks and well placed, suspenseful moments with a great buildup. The ghostly aspect isn't overdone. You know what's coming, and yet, you'll jump anyways. The mood, production, acting and directing of the overall film is, for lack of a better word, haunting. But it works so well, and how it morphs from supernatural to no, was refreshing. I didn't expect that and I liked it.

It starts off incredibly well, but by the middle, the script begins to fragment and the direction of the plot begins to unwind though it barely manages to keep together. What I didn't quite get was the 'pact' part. It's never explained, nor is the final conclusion of the film, which is incredibly vague and unfinished. We are asked to assume to know the fate of Annie's sister and cousin by the mere revelation at the end of the film but that is rather typical of a horror flick: few answers and as many spooky, scary moment as possible.

My one minor complaint was when a couple of new characters seemed to come out of nowhere without much background.  A small complaint, though.  If you like your horror the old-fashioned way without tons of CGI and buckets of gore, this is the film for you.  I was genuinely scared and will admit I actually screamed a few times.",1358812800,,1034,4.407407407407407

Caty Lotz: Where the hell are her other movies?!  I'll be searching right after this review.  I liked her acting, her eyes, hair, and most of all the cleft in her chin.
The plot:  Not bad.  A slight surprise made it refreshing.  Not sure what the pact was.
Scary?:  Had it's moments.  Nothing new really.  Much like most recent horror films.  This movie will probably make you jump once or twice.
Casper Van Dien:  Love this guy.  He and Viggo Mortensen are probably related somehow based on their chins alone.
Overall:  Still have not been really scared by a movie in a long time.  This one didn't do it although I liked the movie.  The Grudge came close 8 years ago.",1358553600,,736,4.4772727272727275

Annie then experiences some weird events while sleeping in the house, when another person also disappears mysteriously.

One interesting aspect of ""The Pact"" is that the house the sisters lived in looks like any other ordinary house on the street. It is not a Gothic manor house, or a cottage surrounded by woods. Of course, this is no ordinary house, as it turns out, and as we follow the process of her uncovering secrets, we learn what was really going on in the film's opening sequence.

This is a well-crafted supernatural thriller, where things eventually make sense (sort of) within the context of the story. There are a few genuinely scary moments, but what makes ""The Pact"" special is the unique approach to the oft-covered subject matter, fine performances from the capable cast including Casper Van Dien and scene-stealing Haley Hudson as a young psychic, and clever storytelling by writer/director Nicholas McCarthy (his feature debut) with his smart and confident direction.",1355961600,5,1196,5.15979381443299

This film was well directed and the actors did great!!!

Only one thing that slightly puzzles me... defined, a ""pact"" is a formal agreement between individuals or parties.  The title wasn't too good a fit for the movie as there was no agreements made between anyone in the film.  I'm not complaining here just pointing it out.

5187202,3,B008WAM2E2,"The trouble with ghost stories is that they all assume that there's some sort of supernatural rule book that spirits and the like have to follow from beyond the grave. These rules change from movie to movie, and audiences are almost never given any glimpse into what they might be. The end result is that viewers think anything can happen, and therein are supposed to lie the movie's chills and thrills. For some, this works. For those who tend to think a lot, it can be distracting as more and more questions pile up in your head.

And don't act like this movie doesn't want you to think. Like most ghost stories, THE PACT is essentially a murder mystery with a ghost (or two?) as characters. In this film, an abusive old woman dies and her oldest daughter, a recovering addict, disappears when she goes to the house to settle the estate. Enter the bitter, younger daughter -- Nicole -- who begins to discover that there is more to the house (and her family) than meets the eye. What follows is a fairly tense, well-filmed, decently-acted, but ambiguously-plotted search for truth that culminates in some truly creepy but head-scratching moments.

Since most ghost stories become a game of Find Out Who Killed Me (or Find Out Why The Ghost Hates You), the film starts to falter as soon as most of its larger secrets are revealed. To compensate for this (I guess) this movie peppers in quite a few bizarre minor mysteries that do more to confuse than tantalize. This includes the final five minutes of the film [SPOILER ALERT: which not only include a completely unrealistic portrayal of how recently orphaned children behave, but END OF SPOILERS] which also adds a final shot that requires you to fill in a ton of blanks on your own, like a MadLibs that only gives you two words of the whole story. ""The (noun) (verb) (preposition) the (adjective) (noun)."" This includes the title of the film, which the audience is likewise required to make an entire book of guesses about.

Decently directed, the movie would've been far more satisfying had it avoided the abundance of red herrings, as well as the loose threads that make me wonder if they were red herrings after all, as well as had our resident ghost played by some clear, definable rules. Ultimately, it's not a bad flick as far as ghost stories goes, but it doesn't do much beyond the same old, same old.",1355788800,14,2361,4.643540669856459

This is not your standard ghost story, but a ghost story with a wicked twist!

A daughter has came back home for her very abusive mother's funeral. She is staying in her mother's house when strange events begin to happen. Things falling off the walls. Someone touching her that is not there. Crazy vivid dreams. A mysterious blonde woman who materializes from thin air. Her sister & cousin comes up missing in the house. Yes, this all sounds like typical overused & abused haunted house clichs, but their done very convincingly, with good direction, strong acting, & a strong soundtrack, that adds a good amount of ghostly dreadful suspense.

""The Pact"" is a hybrid film of two genres. I won't go into details for it would ruin the story. In some ways it reminds me of ""the Entity,"" especially it's soundtrack. It also reminds me of ""Silence of the Lambs"" & ""What Lies Beneath."" Ok, maybe to much information, but that's all I'm giving away.

creepy, get under your skin, movies from that era (specifically, late 70's).

It is well written, well directed, well acted, with a story that has many layers to it.
And it's an interesting story.
I found myself immersed in it, straight from the first scene, almost like a good book, you don't
want to end.
Those complaining that is ""slow moving,"" need to step away from their ""Saw"" DVD library, and
realize that good horror doesn't always have to bludgeon the viewer to death with obvious blood
and guts tactics.

""The Pact"" remains fresh somehow, while borrowing from some more obscure flicks of yesteryear (""Bad

I've seen so many movies like this that cop out towards the end by using something like insanity to explain away all the craziness. This movie did not take that route and brought in a twist that scared me and made me gasp. I think any fan of paranormal movies will find that this is an excellent thriller. I didn't know much about the story before I watched it other than a woman goes back to the house she grew up in after her mother dies and her sister begs her to. Once she arrives she finds that her sister has disappeared into thin air and she goes on a mission to figure out what happened to her sister and what is causing unexplained activity in the house.

5187224,4,B008WAM2E2,"Like most reviewers, I question why this movie's title THE PACT doesn't fit the film?!
THE PACT is a ghost story and a tantalizing mystery hybrid.  Writer/director Nicholas McCarthy uses dim lighting, ominous shadows and eerie music to unravel a tale of deception, revenge and dark family secrets.  Caitey Lotz is very good as the younger sister who reluctantly returns to her homeplace to attend her mother's funeral.  Upon arrival, she discovers her older sister (Agnes Bruckner0 has inexplicably vanished, leaving her young daughter in the care of cousin Liz.  When Liz likewise disappears and Annie is attacked by an unseen force, she turns to a dissolute detective (Casper van Dien in a restrained performance) and a young psychic woman for help in solving the mystery.
THE PACT does move leisurely, but I got involved anyway.  There are some plot inconsistencies and a puzzling final shot, but overall I find THE PACT to be a decent rental option.",1352678400,,953,5.006329113924051

I have to disagree with those reviews and say that by the end of this unique ghost story, it all worked for me. Since it does take patience and is a slow building story, I can understand why some people would be compelled to give up on it about halfway through. I went into this film not expecting much at all other than an average, typical ghost story. What I got was solid acting, an interesting story that kept me into it, and a few scares that were pretty well done. It also has somewhat of a cool turn to the plot that I wasn't expecting from your everyday ghost story movie. I won't spoil anything about it, but I will say I was pleasantly surprised with the direction it went in towards the latter half of the film. Some reviewers have said that it confuses you and doesn't explain enough. I would have to disagree with that as well, and say that while it does need your attention and may make you think a little, I wasn't confused by anything when the credits started rolling. The director did make room for a couple different theories one could come up with, but it didn't take anything away from it. If you're a fan of horror movies, especially paranormal type horror, and don't mind having to think a little, I would check this one out.

It tries to be a little Hitchcockian in that it slowly unravels a story.  It had such potential!  Unfortunately, it did not lay the ground work for the story and there were gapping holes.  After watching the movie, we were like, ""The name does not even fit.""  The writer had an excellent idea, too bad he did not have someone there to help direct it a little more strongly.

If you do, your patience will be rewarded and both the movie and the title will make sense. It's better to be unspoiled for this movie, but I'll tell you this: the horror subgenre switches gears about two thirds of the way in. Well, I suppose it's not spoiling to touch on things you'll see in the trailer. The plot begins with two sisters who are settling their late mother's estate. There's a lot of family tension because their mother was, shall we say, not a nice woman - and that's before the elder sister disappears inside the house. A lot of bumps in the night follow and our heroine, the younger sister, endears herself greatly to the audience by doing what anyone would do in that situation: running full tilt boogie out of the place. She soon discovers that it's not that easy to run from this problem and she will bring both a police officer and an old friend from high school who sees spirits in for assistance before all is said and done. There are some real heart-stopper moments in this movie and the filmmakers did a really good job with the special effects on a low budget. Standout performances belong to Caity Lotz as younger sister Annie and Haley Hudson as psychic friend Stevie. Lotz has a muscular presence that does not go to waste, either in her confrontations with other characters or in one balletic slow-mo shot. Hudson brings a bruised-eye delicacy to a character who might otherwise have been a cliche. There is one actor who both literally and figuratively phoned it in (seen much better work from that one, don't understand what happened) and also a nagging question that goes unanswered, both of which together cost a star.

Annie occupies her mother's house and also cares for Nicole's daughter (Dakota Bright) who she has met for the first time. Weird things start to happen in the house until Annie seeks refuge at the police station.

At this point an unkempt Bill Creek (Casper Van Dien) shows up. The ghost starts to leave Annie clues. The suspense/thriller/ horror aspect was good. Once you find out what is going on, it takes the film down a peg.

I wasn't sure what they were trying to accomplish with the very end. It took a certain ""seriousness"" out of the production.

5187272,5,B008WAM2E2,"This flick was full of suspense. There isn't much blood and gore at all. It is a suspenseful mystery with a bit of a twist ending. Reminded me of the the movie, ""What Lies Beneath"" in that it doesn't rely on blood and gore to give you chills. I thought the acting was well done. There are a couple of plot holes, but it is way better than most horror flicks that usually have huge plot holes and it really will scare you if you like classic horror movies. I saw it in a theater, so I can't tell you anything about the quality of the DVD or Digital Download.",1343692800,,557,4.072727272727272
5187273,4,B008WAM2E2,"of IFC's latest, The Pact, is a film revolving around a young woman named Annie and her struggle to piece together mysterious happenings in the home she lived in as a child. With the death of her mother and the disapearance of her sister shortly after, Annie, played to perfection by Caity Lotz, returns home only to realize that she is not alone. With strange bumps in the night, she flees the house, but returns later and is forced to take a closer look into dark past of her family.

With stunning cinematograsphy and effects, The Pact, gives more spine tingeling chills than most of the supernatural films that have been released lately. With suspence setting in just minutes into the film and not letting up until the credits roll, audiences will be holding onto their seats for the entire ride. With the disterbing imagery coupled with some excellent editing and direction, the hair will stand up on the back of your neck throughout the film. The film contains minimal gore, but the blood comes not only as a pleasent surprise, but also as an eye-opening and well done effect. You're not getting the bloody goodness of the slashers, but some very well timed suspenseful scares.

Not having seen a decent supernatural horror film in a while, I am delighted to praise The Pact. With the music quing up at all the right times and the cuts being dead on, the mystery is to die for. I would be happy with a ending that cuts to black a few minutes earlier, but honestly, this film still holds up with the additional running time and does not seem to drag on. Be on the look out for this film, written and directed by Nicholas McCarthy.",1342569600,7,1635,4.557823129251701
5187274,5,B008WAM2E2,"I just saw this at the Laemmle in North Hollywood. I knew nothing about it, save a 'go see it' from a friend. This is a terrific movie, smart, stylish when it needs to be and very scary. I actually yelled out three times in the theatre... it has a few of those scares. But even better, it's creepy and unnerving. It really gets under your skin. As for the complaints that it is too slow... this is such a tiresome complaint from people about various scary movies. (Full disclosure... I get the same complaint about a ghost story I directed.) I'd go off about attention spans and people needing blood and guts but what's the point. We all like what we like, and I loved this movie. It does have some big scares and some blood but it takes it's time and the movie is all the better for it. I, for one, was on edge from almost the start. Beautifully done, check it out!",1342569600,77,866,4.22289156626506
5187305,5,B008WAM2E2,"I wanted to see this movie ever since I saw a preview and it was worth every last cent and I had 2 buy this movie twice because with 20 minutes left what I watching it on quit working and I was dying to see what happened and I did not expect the ending at all and for those who don't get what was going on use your brain its pretty easy to figure out exactly what had happened and why just pay attention.  This movie is so worth the rental to me its one of the best it wasn't over the top on anything and had a few scary parts that made me jump and nothing makes me jump so that right there was worth it and I will be buying this movie as soon as it comes out so if you want something that has a good story line and a few scary parts and a ending that will surprise the crap out of you watch this but if you are expecting a Steven Spielberg type film then just watch something else because you will probably just be to much of a critic and not enjoy something original without all the special effects otherwise so worth watching, so enjoy and watch it in the dark by yourself if you like to be scared cause thats even better.

5187308,4,B008WAM2E2,"O.K. I'll come right out and say I'm a horror movie fan.  I watch a horror movie every day while I walk for an hour - hour and a half on my treadmill.  I didn't have terribly high hopes for this one...but I stand corrected.  It is very well done.  It starts out as a family drama, and then quickly veers into haunted house territory.  Had a few scary jumps (dangerous on treadmill!) and chills in the first half hour, and from there the feeling of unease and dread just builds and builds.  A scene in the final half hour is especially effective - there is a twist at the end that I'll admit I didn't see coming.  Is the movie perfect?  No.  There is a character who is supposed to be a medium who is a little...too much, but I'm quibbling.  I think you'll find ""The Pact"" is worth checking out.",1341705600,,794,4.1644736842105265

5187310,4,B008WAM2E2,"The Pact is a slow horror film that mixes tension with jump-out scares. I don't want to spoil the scares, but I will say the movie has similar scares to the frights found in Insidious and kind of like Paranormal Activity (this is not a handheld camera film, by the way). Some of the scares were expected, but still managed to creep me out a bit. In the right environment, it should deliver some spine-tingling frights.  I have mixed feelings about the ending though, it's original but moves away from what the the first two acts built. Some may dislike the slow pace, but I felt it worked well. Acting was fine most of the time, and the music was great.

For your information, the film has some blood and gore, terror, and partial nudity (nothing serious or over the top), in case you were planning to watch it with anyone under 17 (it's Not Rated, but it's pretty tamed). Worth 9.99? Maybe for fans of this type of horror, but you should wait for a drop if you're barely interested. I enjoyed it, though.",1339632000,45,1005,4.427027027027027

5187313,2,B008WAM2E2,"The Pact is a movie about two sisters who return to their childhood home for their abusive mother's funeral.  When the eldest sister, Nicole, a recovered junkie and mother to a four year old girl, disappears, the younger sister, Annie, is left to unravel some family mysteries.  It's a bit difficult to unravel family mysteries when your home appears to be haunted by a violent poltergeist, but she does what she can.

I don't want to get into the things she learns, because that would be spoiler city, but she does uncover some things about her family that make this a bit richer than a run-of-the-mill haunted house movie.  However, a lot of time is spent trying to give us a feel for her tough, jaded character, but it just falls flat.  She's a sun-damaged biker chick with a pissy attitude and that's clear within the first five minutes of her screen time.  The additional time watching her make sourpuss faces and being a jerk to the people who want to help her is kind of wasted, when it could be spent getting into the history of her mother, her family, her house, et cetera.

The good points of the movie are that the setting and mood are well done.  There is a creepy vibe throughout, especially within the house.  I also would like to give kudos for using contemporary technology (internet, GPS, etc) in a realistic but spooky way.  It's neither completely ignored or overused, like in most horror movies these days.

My number one pet peeve, however, is that there is no pact in the movie.  The title is really a poor fit for the film.  Perhaps they meant to get more into a pact that might be in the history of some of the characters who are barely featured in the movie, but if that is the case, they forgot to include those scenes but remembered to leave in the title that makes no sense.",1338595200,15,1802,4.4573170731707314
