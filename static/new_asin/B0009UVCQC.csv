2323678,5,B0009UVCQC,"the idea that this was a ""sexy"" series made me wonder what it would be like, but i have to admit it was way more than i thought it would be, it was absolutely great, a very tough workout that made me feel so good, my arms were toned and looking good and i was feeling so good toning my shoulders and felt like i could continue and get even better, i owe it to leisa harts videos, she is the best!",1138320000,7,396,3.841463414634146
2323679,5,B0009UVCQC,"Sweeping pink curtains frame the room as the word ""Sexy"" shimmers on the wall. Flower mats are placed around the room with short chairs for balance. The workout seems fairly breezy at first as you sway and swirl scarves while exercising your arms, back and stomach muscles.

This seems more of a upper body workout with a focus on arms. The exercises can be felt the next day, while doing the workout and you will see results fast. Even after just one workout, you will feel a tightening and toning of your upper arms. With an abundance of creative appeal, Leslie Hart has succeeded in making exercise fun and challenging. There are four segments that can be done all at once for the full effect or you can mix and match two workouts at a time.

Items Needed:

Chair

Mat or Towel

3-lb weights or Exercise Band

Colorful Scarf (A belt from your robe seems less effective, it needs to be lightweight. The motion is what makes the exercise work and the scarf makes it playful.)

Also contains bonus workouts. The exercises tone the upper body, especially the arms and the variety keeps you focused. The arm movements change constantly and so you never get bored or anxious while waiting for the next exercise. The ""Sexy"" workout series is actually playful and very creative. You won't need to learn serious dance steps during this workout and yet the exercises make you feel like you are completing a dancer's upper body workout.

2323680,5,B0009UVCQC,"another innovative and effective video from my new favortie intructor Leisa Hart. My arms are more toned and defined than ever before. Leisa is a dynamic and motivating instructor, not an over the top denise austin or tv ham julian michaels. Arms are not as jiggly doing this tape, and i like the feel of the entire workout.",1130716800,3,324,4.603448275862069
2323681,5,B0009UVCQC,"This is a good, motivating and sometimes challenging workout.  Many exercises are the old fashioned typicall effective ones, but there are some new things to try that help work your muscles in different ways.  Leisa is a good instructor and helps push you along in this.  You can do one, two or three workouts - depending on the amount of time you have.  There is also a bonus workout as a special feature.  This ones good too and I recommend this dvd to anyone a little self-conscious about their jiggly arms.",1128124800,10,510,4.56043956043956

8067173,3,B0009UVCQC,"There are some interesting pieces to this workout and I think it is worth doing, but for me it took a little while to get into the moves.  The cuing is not great - not awful, but not great.  The production is only okay, and sometimes the zooming in on certain people or body parts is not well chosen.  However, once you get into the workout and learn the particular moves, there are some gems here that I haven't encountered anywhere else.  I like the range of motion in particular.",1439942400,,482,4.322222222222222
8067174,4,B0009UVCQC,"I like this one best out of the series. If you're not using a resistance band, you can use dumbbells, except on the second bonus workout. However, the workout is so short  (this one is only about 25 minutes long for the main workout) that you should quickly be able to move to heavier weights. Not a bad workout to take with you when traveling, you can do it in your hotel room and not feel like you're being a total slug, especially if you sneak in a few extra reps between segments while she's talking and hold off on any stretching until the end (this workout is not strenuous enough to justify the number of stretch breaks she takes).

I don't understand the reasoning behind the bonus workouts being on a separate menu--they should have just been put with the regular chapters.

I hope this entire series gets reissued on a single DVD in future that you can program to mix and match the different segments--each workout is only about a 1/2 hour in length, and even adding the two bonus segments on each workout only adds another 10 minutes at most.",1204329600,2,1053,4.44559585492228
8067175,2,B0009UVCQC,"I'm having a hard time doing this routine through because I can't follow the instructions very well. The camera angles change too quickly and in the middle of movements, so I can't keep oriented and figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. It's very frustrating.",1167868800,3,263,4.739130434782608
