426472,5,6302130115,I'm a big fan of Ian McEwan.  I really didn't think I would enjoy the movie because no movie is as good as the book.  But the visual this book is better than my own when I read the book and the movie stay's true to the book.  I highly recommend to all Ian McEwan fans.,1003276800,,268,3.75
426473,5,6302130115,"This is an excellent adaptation by Harold Pinter of the McEwan Novel with superb cinematography and an evocation of the eirie atmosphere as well as the incredible beauty of Venice. All four main castmembers put in great performances with Christopher Walken at his dangerous best as the sophisticated yet strangely chilling protagonist. Helen Mirren,Rupert Everett and Natasha Richardson are perfectly cast and give faultless performances. The scenes shot on the Lido are especially interesting and bring back memories of Dirk Bogart in Thomas Manns ""Death in Venice"",which you will find is a surprisingly appropriate reference even though the subject matter is vastly different. I also enjoyed the scenes shot late at night in which Christopher Walken mysteriously introduces an innocent Rupert Everett to some of the seedier nightclubs of Venice. Beautiful shots of the more well -known parts of Venice abound,with a beautiful soundtrack to highlight them. All this plus a spinechilling ending!
A pity this is out of production .I recommend it to the studio that they put this out on DVD.It could become a cult classic",998265600,22,1119,5.292134831460674
426584,3,6302130115,"I gave this movie three stars mainly because it keeps a guy watching.  It's staying power is derived from the question I kept asking myself... what the hell is this thing all about anyway?  I noticed several reviewers (who must be descendants of Freud or Jung) have given deep unending psychological meaning to all the four main characters.  For me suffice to say these folks have issues, the Walken & Mirren characters being downright certifiable.

Which brings us to the two lovebirds on holiday in one of the most beautiful cities in the world... the Everett & Richardson characters.  Gee the questions surrounding this boyfriend, girlfriend duo are just unending (that is what director Schrader would have you believe).  In reality their characters are just a couple of shallow wutz's that can't spot obvious psychotic behavior in other people and who are unable to make any meaningful commitment to one another.  They stay together mainly for the sex (not a stretch to figure this out) and because the infatuation of Natasha for Rupert based on his Adonis like beauty.  This is brought to bear on the viewer in one scene with about as much subtlety as a meat ax... heh, heh...check this out.

Rupert and Natasha are dining in a restaurant and Natasha notices all of their fellow diners are looking at them.  She explains to her lover that everyone is looking at him due to his dazzling beauty.  Oh Rupert, you handsome devil you!  I know for certain that if the striking Natasha Richardson was sitting at a table in my vicinity my attention would certainly not be on some guy.  I would also be dropping my coffee spoon semi-regularly, laboriously bending over to pick it up hoping for a quick peek.  (Aside: Perverted I know... but... is it really?)  Regardless this scene is kinda funny and had me chuckling.

Anyway as the plot coagulates, oop's I mean thickens, you may wonder why the two love birds are so interested in the two screwball characters, Moe & Curly Joan (joke) ... (the Walken and Mirren characters).  This is not explained in the movie, other than the fly/spider malediction, and just as well since it makes absolutely no sense.

I believe part of the ""why"" as in why so many reviewers consider this movie some kind of masterpiece is due to its extremely violent, inexplicable ending.  ""Inexplicable"" being the operative word for myriad reasons. This out of left field climax may lead a shallow thinker to believe there must be some deep, deep hidden meaning.  Well gang... it ain't necessarily so.  I will admit however it will keep you watching.

Couple of final words... I really didn't feel anything for these characters and Mr. Schrader has made one of the most lovely, riveting, classical & beautiful cities in the world, Venice, completely unremarkable with the exception of its back alleys and narrow dark streets which were filmed almost exclusively at night.  Paul must be commended, it can't be easy to do that.  And some books translate to the silver screen quite well and some do not... this one falls in the latter.

I'm glad I bought it for only $7.99 at B&N in 2004. I'd have been angry otherwise.

Leonard Maltin's Movie Review gave this flick One And Half Stars. I'd give it the same review, but can't on Amazon so I will instead give Two Stars for the remarkable setting and great wardrobe. Otherwise this movie has no ""soul.""

426644,5,6302130115,"Iam McEwan's short novel is a masterpiece of perversion and a good novel rarely holds promise for a great film.  In this case I was amazed by the adaptation.  The film is wonderfully faithful to the novel.  True, it would be difficult not to enjoy watching almost anything filmed in Venice, but the camerawork here is particularly sumptuous.  All four actors are perfect.  It is now impossible for me to think of those roles incarnated in any other way.  The denouement is somewhat different than in the novel, but even more powerful.

426647,5,6302130115,"I have been a fan of this glorious waltz through deranged minds and innocents since first seeing it aboard Naval Air Station Diego Garcia (in the middle of the Indian Ocean). After the films conclusion, when an audience of hardened Military Pilots (and Crews) disperse in silence (some in tears), it's a sure bet that the film has some kind of film magic in it.

Since Natasha Richardson's dealth this past year, it has been almost impossible to find a copy of this film unless you were willing to mortgage your home to pay for it. Rupert Everet has the perfect blend of handsome masculinity mixed with innocence, that makes men and women both (even STR8 Military men) stop for a moment and want to touch. Helen Mirren can tear your heart out with such smoothness that you won't even notice it gone until you fall over clutching your chest and notice the emptiness. Christopher Walken is the quintessential carrier of the essence of Evil, hidden behind Dupioni Silks and a crude swaveness that can break down the human spirit with a flick of a hand.

Incorporate all above and then, add Venice as the backprop. The mist, the twinkle of light upon the waters of the canals. The mixture of fear and inexaustible curiosity of the younger couple (Richardson and Everet) with the lifestyle of the more mature couple (Mirren and Walken) behind the stark stone facade of their sumptious mansion overlooking the canals.

Slow and deliberate in it's plot-building, the storyline makes a quick turn directly into depraved madness.

Venice is glorious to see.  I loved Natasha's hair & clothes.  The shoes she wears when Colin draws the pictures are just wonderful.  They were sexy & feminine yet made for walking, unlike the spike heels now.

Everyone who's spoken of this film thus far forget Helen Mirren.  I really liked her in all of her oddnesses.  I can't say enough about Christopher Walken.  This was my first Walken film and I became hooked.

Colin & Marry go to Venice for the second time on vacation & to decide what to do with their relationship.  They meet Robert seemingly by chance.  He has horrific plans for them.

426651,4,6302130115,"Film based on Ian McEwan's novel, masterfully prepared for big screen by Harold Pinter.  Cast includes incredible Helen Mirren, Christopher Walken, Natasha Richardon and Rupert Everett.  It is a story set in beautiful and romantic Venice, where two lovers are trying to re-ignite their affair away from everyone else they know: their work, children and famiy.  In the course of strolling thru the labyrinth of Venice's streets, they run into a man who tells them odd, creepy tales.  In spite of dislike they take into him, Venice is just not city big enough to avoid stranger's lure long enough, especially since he is obsessed with the young man and determine to run into them at every opportune moment.  Before long, this young couple is drawn into a strange ritual of the middle aged couple whose motives for the excessive hospitality are difficult to comprehend at once.  But as passion between these two young lovers is slowly but surely re-ignated, so is repressed homosexual attraction that Christopher Walken's character Robert feels for the young man played by Everett.

426652,2,6302130115,"This film (along with ""Don't Look Now"") was recommended by a friend as a countermeasure to my praise about the beauty of Venice. And, indeed, the city is well-represented throughout the film.

My partner and I sat down and were engaged with the plot as husband-and-wife Rupert Everett and Natasha Richardson are slowly drawn further and further into the world of the Italian Christopher Walken and his Canadian wife, played by Helen Mirren. Everett, incidentally, plays well the role of a loving yet disconcerted husband in this film. (Who says a gay actor cannot convincingly play a straight man?) Walken is very good as the sinister Venetian.

So why only two stars? Well, the build-up of the tension is well-handled, but the ending, the climax of the film, is so laughably preposterous, if it were not so disgustingly violent. We felt short-changed. And since we could not conceivably envisage a time when we would want to sit down and watch this movie again (despite the views of Venice), the DVD now sits in the cupboard awaiting the next charity bag that drops through the letterbox.",1199491200,,1089,4.881081081081081

426714,2,6302130115,"This second Ian McEwan novel to make it to the screen arrived with dizzying credits, apart from the stature of the novelist himself. It was directed by the daring Paul Schrader, adapted by British playwright Harold Pinter, and scored by the innovative Angelo Badalamenti. In the power cast are Rupert Everett and Natasha Richardson as lovers vacationing in Venice, and Christopher Walken and Helen Mirren as Venetians who befriend them. They are costumed by Giorgio Armani and photographed by Dante Spinotti, who shot ""The Insider"" and ""LA Confidential."" The canals are impressive, but the movie is dead in the water.

Beautiful locations (old world interiors, glassmaking at Murano) and beautiful people are good for so many minutes. Nudity, lovemaking, homoeroticism and sado-masochism carry this movie a little longer. But eventually you have to tell an interesting story with plausible characters, as McEwan did in his book. That essential has eluded Schrader and his famous collaborators. The concluding murder is unbelievable and inevitable at the same time, and the ending is maddeningly ambiguous. At least the victim, like the viewer, was not bored to death. That's the best you can say about this bad DVD transfer of a disappointing film.",1125705600,4,1248,5.271356783919598
426715,1,6302130115,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Rupert Everett is a perfect mannequin, standing around modeling his clothes in the WORST performance by any movie actor in history; Helen Mirren is totally wasted; she looks like she's barely paying attention. Richardson looks embarrassed, and Walken hams it up as his trademarked cliched ""creepy guy"", who's about as intriguing as a Chicken McNugget. He reminds me of the Euro seducer ""The Continental"" from SNL. Even the mood music is bad. The only mystery about this movie is why these horrible, stupid, and completely boring characters don't just pass out from ennui as they spout out their inane, stilted streams of dialogue. Really, this is a movie about ventriloquist dummies who get lost in the somewhat confusing streets of Venice. You will not care about these people; in fact you will need coffee to stay awake to the end.",1124064000,12,881,4.88
426716,5,6302130115,"The Comfort of Strangers will appeal to those who are perceptive, have a long attention span, and love films that require attention to detail.  This film is the model for understated elegance, with a plot line that at times seems mundane but with a world of subtext that could only have been created by the combined genius of Harold Pinter, Ian McEwan, and Paul Schrader.

Rupert Everett gives an excellent performance alongside Natasha Richardson as the self-obsessed boyfriend.  But Walken and Mirren are even better, putting in career defining performances as the deviant couple that pulls Everett and Richardson into their twisted web.

There seems to be some confusion over the relationship of Everett and Richardson's characters.  They are a couple that is considering moving in together, but nowhere in the film does it say that they are married as several reviewers have stated.  In fact, Richardson is not even sure if Everett likes her kids, and she does an excellent job evoking the angst of the single mother trying to decide what she wants out of this man.  Their state of uncertainty is important to this film because it provides the vulnerability that Walken preys on.

Everett and Richardson do find comfort in their sexual connection, but it needs to be noted that this connection only peaks after they've been subjected to the cruel mind games of Walken's ""Robert.""  They too are strangers, in a sense, to each other.  Robert senses this, and cunningly picks apart their fears and weaknesses.  In the end, their polite tolerance of Robert and Caroline's strange games has very negative consequences.

The dialogue of the movie can alienate the viewer sometimes.  The ""thighs conversation"" and the ""we were this gang"" monologue are slightly forced.  But these are minor bumps in a road that requires careful study and appreciation.  The characters speak out of things from the recesses of their minds and hearts.  It's not always ""entertaining,"" but it is always meaningful and profound.

The film is also visually stunning, evoking of sense of Venice as few other films have.  The use of colors and lighting make this a masterpiece of cinematic precision.  While this type of shooting is more commonplace today, the high quality is really stunning when considering this movie was made in the early 90s on an independant film budget.  Simply brilliant.

I highly recommend this picture.  Fans of Pinter and McEwan will not be disappointed!  Enjoy!",1108339200,47,2464,5.029629629629629
426717,5,6302130115,"Strange movie, creepy almost. But I loved it so much that I had to go to Venice. I had to see it for myself. The story is about a couple who lost the magic in their marriage and go to the romantic Venice to find it again. Instead they find this other couple, kind of strange but seductive and their intentions are not the best. A sensual movie about romance and death. The end is at least a huge surprise, you'll never see that coming. I confess, I like Christopher Walken and therefore the movie. It's creepy, shoking!, decadent, seducitve...everything, nice setting and great music. Watch it.

426718,4,6302130115,This is one of those movies where you are left wondering long after its over whether you understood what happened and why it happened. I can't say I have much confidence in my own analysis of this plot and these four characters. I think things are left sketchy on purpose too so you feel as disoriented as the characters in the film do. I have my opinions about who did what and why but since the plot never winds down to any final resolution you are never certain whether you were right or not. This kind of film is disturbing because it deals with things that  have no easy rational explanation--like the darker side of the psyche and its relation to desire and death. That said the film is a wonder to look at. My take on the film:Rupert Everett & Natasha Richardson are a confused couple who really don't belong together but don't know it yet. Everett is narcissistic and bored with both his wife and his job and perhaps with life itself. Richardson is drawn to Everetts beauty but so is everyone else. Including Walken and Mirren. Walken and Mirren live in an opulent kind of decadence surrounded by PreRaphaelite paintings depicting sensual languor. When Everett and Richardson sleepover at Walken and Mirrens villa they are photographed to look just like one of the paintings on the villas walls as they sleep with bedsheets barely concealing their nude bodies. Walken and Mirren possess all kinds of art objects and they play rough games with each other. Once they spot Everett they know they must involve him in some way.  There is strange chemistry between Everett and Walken as soon as they meet and equally strange but less potent chemistry between Everett and Mirren. It seems both desire him. Walken and Mirren strike Everett and Richardson as more than just a little odd and yet they are also very curious about the older couple who are obviously interestd in them.  Walken is rude and even violent to Everett and yet he seems to offer himself to this couple willingly submitting to whatever they have in mind for him. The couple obviously ignites something that had been dormant in him. Richardson is stunning in her own right but Everetts desire for her is really directed more toward  Walken and Mirren who interest him far more than Richardson.  As much as I like this film there are clues which never lead anywhere like the story Walken tells about his father which both initiates the frienship between the couples and is once again repeated at the close of the story. We are never convinced of Walkens authenticity as an aristocrat so everything he says is suspect including the story of his father which reveals nothing really whether it is true or not. I think this little story within the story is a clue that some stories make very little sense and because they make so little sense they continue to haunt the imagination.,1056844800,12,2847,4.674650698602794
426719,5,6302130115,"I have watched this movie via home video three times now and find something new to like about it each time. Released in 1991, this movie is based on an early novel of the same title by Ian McEwan so we are fairly sure from the outset that the characters won't all live happily ever after. Set in Venice and beautifully filmed, the movie is directed by Paul Schrader; the screenplay is written by Harold Pinter so we're obviously not dealing with slouches here.
There are only four characters in the movie, all of whom do commendable acting jobs: Rupert Everett, Natasha Richardson, Christopher Walken and Helen Mirren. Everett's good looks sometimes get in the way of his acting-- at least for me-- that does not happen here, however. A lot of appropriate adjectives fit this movie: sinister, scary, shocking, compelling, mysterious, sexually ambiguous, suspenseful. I do not know how much time this movie got in theatres, but it is a very fine movie indeed. It is certainly an artistic success and ought to have had a wide viewing.
This movie reminded me of both DEATH IN VENICE from the Thomas Mann novel and DON'T LOOK NOW. Another beautiful movie filmed in this otherwordly beautiful city about death and dying and/or horror.",1055203200,9,1229,4.80188679245283
426720,4,6302130115,"I return to this film at regular intervals as I return to other films such as Woody Allen's MANHATTAN.  But where Mr Allen's film is as much watchable for its witty dialogue and characterisation , THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS is watchable for quite a number of different reasons.  The overall idea of the story I take it to be is of two lovers from the modern world returning to an older and different culture to try and recapture their private past.  If this older culture is a metaphor for their private past then their past is a murky, fluid, labrynthine, decaying place of intrigue and mystery which is how Venice is portrayed in the film.  I may be misreading the major idea of the film but to my mind the film has a serious moral side to it.  Certainly, the two lovers are not innocents.  The male is portrayed as  selfish, vain, indulgent , and the female as having abandoned her children, albeit temporarily.  They are both self-absorbed and shallow people, looking for something.  They find some relief in sexual passion.  But after they meet two locals, their holiday changes.  Having said that, the two lovers are deliriously good to look at.  Rupert  Everett must be one of the most beautiful men ever to have graced the screen and, dressed in his casual Armani clothes throughout the film, and in the prime of his youth, he is a visual and sensual treat to behold.  Natasha Richardson has a wholesome beauty but her hair is a golden glory .  Her Armani clothes also bewitch.  The two Venetian locals , Christopher Walken, and Helen Mirren, aristocratic, decadent, sexually deviant,  provide an interesting double for the visitors.  He in his white silk/linen Armani suit, she in her gowns.  The acting by this quartet, is pitch perfect.  The dialogue by Harold Pinter weird and wonderful: the film begins and ends with a monologue by Mr Walken about his character's father, a vain man who used to touch up his greying moustache with mascara. And the fans of David Lynch and his TWIN PEAKS will be delighted with the eerie music by master Angelo Badalamenti.  Camerawork by Mr Spinotti and sets by Mr Quaranta are resplendently rich.  Paul Schrader delivers a mis en scene, a suspense, performances that deserve repeated viewings.  It may not be a masterpiece but it reveals a great deal about what film making can be in the hands of gifted artists.  Compelling viewing.  No flat spots.

Kudos to Angelo Badalamenti for what may be his best score; it sets the mood right away during the titles and lets you know this is a twisting and twisted film that will be seducing you at the same time it's pulling you into a dark abyss.

426723,5,6302130115,"This fine film suffered the fate of bad marketing by Skouras Films when it premiered in 1991, and thus, lacks exposure,and  appears to be out-of-print! Nevermind that it's slow going for the average Hellplex patron seeking eyecandy; it's an exceptionally well-crafted affair from head to toe (with an incredible score by Angelo Badalamenti, visuals from ace Italian lensman Dante Spinotti, production design inspired by Ferdinando Scarfiotti, and four expert performances from its core ensemble).
Shrader works from a script by Harold Pinter, which is a right-on adaptation of the decadent novel by Ian McEwan to tell a twisted story of sexual intrigue set in dear old creepy/lovely Venice, Italy.  Yes, there are lovely scenes on the Lido and Grand Canal, but the picture of La Serrinissima here is more akin to, say, ""Don't Look Now"" than David Lean's postcard-pretty ""Summertime"" - a maze of canals and claustrophobic alleyways turning in on themselves in the style of its characters' psyches.
What is this film really about? That's open to discussion. At heart, it's a tale of a younger couple adrift in the byways of speculation about the meaning and purpose of their own relationship, and this makes them vulnerable to the apetities of a bored and rich niddle-aged couple looking for some ""beauty must be punished"" type thrills. There you have it: each man kills the thing he loves, someone said.
Pinter does his usual accent on dialogue with repeated lines searching for their true meaning (Everett: ""This book makes no sense! I can't read this book!""). Christopher Walken is charmingly creepy in his white Armani threads and vague sexuality; Helen Mirren approaches genius with her take on a woman held captive in a palazzo to a self-invented aristocrat and her own sexual imagination (""ahhh, but if a man came, THEN something would happen (cackle, cackle).""); empathy for the younger couple, Everett and Richardson is established sufficiently, although Miranda Richardson's boyishness threw a curve into the story I'm not certain was supposed to be there. Maybe Shrader could elaborate.
COMFORT is funny, sad, morose, romantic, challenging, subtle. In flashes it is classic Gothic - black as black can be.
It does, however, demand several viewings over time to excavate its riches.  If one still comes up with a feeling that something critical may be missing, well, that may or may not be part of its point:  one never leaves Venice feeling wholly satisfied - it is always calling one back, back, back to its come-hither intrigues.",1016064000,10,2540,5.113253012048193

Every scene Mr. Wakens was acting in, the viewers eyes followed  his every movement.  The movie settings  in Venice,  Italy are ausome.  For the price, the viewer will not be disappointed.

7821446,1,6302130115,"This is the story of an English couple, unmarried, who return to Venice to decide where their relationship should go and end up meeting a sadomasichistic maniac (Christopher Walken) and his subservient, masochistic wife (Helen Mirren) who are both sexually obsessed with the English man (Rupert Everett). The film unfolds slowly, slowly, like a dull, muddy river.  The couple walk around Venice, eat, go to bed, talk softly about their relationship, make obvious observations about gender roles. When the final, violent climax occurs, we're just glad the thing is over and we can go ahead and clean the kitchen, eat a snack, take out the garbage, which will most likely contain this annoying DVD, cracked into small pieces.",1408060800,3,723,5.127118644067797

Harold Pinter is known as a playwright (and screenwriter) who crafts scenes with tension just below the surface.  The tension is palpable, but the main issue is never overtly addressed in dialogue.  Instead, characters are set to simmer in their own neuroses and challenged to overcome them.  The dialogue is a toy, a game, teasing the viewer to look beneath the surface at what is REALLY going on.  That's subtext.

Beautifully crafted and exquisitely performed by the best actors of our era, this is a film not to be missed for film connoisseurs.",1403913600,2,793,4.82962962962963
