8601281,1,B00E4YPBVG,"NC-17 content.  I wish I had known that prior to watching.  I know that will not be troubling to some, but I want other parents to be aware. Knowledge is power  :)  I needed eye bleach and earwash after hearing all the unkind, hurtful profanities hurled, and watched the movie devolve into 'locker room' humor about male genitals.  We watched much of this movie because my son's Theater teacher at UTA has a role, but sadly, she did not inform them of the content.  Sorry we spent 65 minutes on most of this 90-min. movie.  Again, YMMV, but I want fellow students and parents to be informed  :)",1421193600,,594,4.435185185185185
