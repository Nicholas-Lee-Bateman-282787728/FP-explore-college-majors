217627,3,6300184595,"I found this one of the weaker episodes. This one still featured the goodies you come to expect from""Buck"",Wilma Deering and her jump suit, Gil Gerard creakily completing martial arts moves,thatlittle robot  guy and the contrasting of 25th century Earth with 20th Century Earth. But  there was no atomosphere. Vampire stories demand a certain amount of gloom  and creepiness, thats one thing that makes them fun and its also the one  thing this episode lacks.  At least the set lights could have been dimmed.  Any Buck is good Buck, but this one disappointed me a little because I  expected better.",949190400,,598,4.92
217628,5,6300184595,"Space vampire was one of the better ""Buck"" episodes, along with ""vegas in space"" ect. as alway's  Erin Grey  made the episode work of course. when the vamp was ""speaking thru Her"" it was  chilling Of course back then I was 15-16 yr's old.  The Buck Roger's  episodes brought in many special effect's to broadcast t.v..  of course  disco was the flavor of the day then also. alway's a sci-fi fan since 8-9 I  enjoyed buck roger's along with my library of perhaps 2000 paper-back  book's (sci-fi) I had read by that time Space Vampire is a very good Buck  roger's episode to keep and enjoy again and again....",948067200,3,607,4.486238532110092

I foolishly thought this would contain more material than the individual ""Season 1"" and ""Season 2"" Blu-Ray packages you can purchase separately. It does NOT. It is the same two Blu-Ray cases, but in a long, flimsy box (nothing nice). So I paid 25% more for that.

217707,3,6300184595,They left a few scenes out from the pilot episode.  I clearly remember him asking for a Marlboro and a Coke but these have been edited for whatever reason.  Makes me suspicious as to what else is left out.,1504483200,2,205,4.230769230769231
217728,4,6300184595,"It's hard to believe that the pilot movie ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" was released to theaters in 1979 because it's so cartoony and the effects are downright lame compared to ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" which came out eight months later. Not to mention the original Star Wars Trilogy. Heck, the F/X don't even hold up to The Original Series of Star Trek that ran from 1966-1969. No kidding.

Yet, this doesn't mean that the pilot movie ""Awakening"" or the series isn't entertaining. It is, but don't expect the maturity or quality of Star Trek, although some episodes come close. Star Trek is dramatic science-fiction whereas Star Wars is a fantasy packaged as science-fiction or ""space fantasy."" ""Buck Roger""  the pilot movie and the series  tries to walk the line between these two and ends up being inferior to both. But, again, this doesn't mean it's not entertaining, particularly for kids or adults who just wanna turn off their brains and have fun.

While most of the stories in series are okay at best, and often lame, the main protagonists and most of the guest stars are outstanding. Gil Gerard in the titular role, for instance, is just as effective as William Shatner as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, maybe even more so, if that were possible. And then there's Erin Gray as Col. Wilma Deering, one of the hottest space babes in the history of film or television. Not to mention, Pamela Hensley has the requisite ""looks that kill"" as the oversexed antagonist, Ardala (not that she trips my trigger). And then there's the gazillion of female guests throughout the series that are often even more beautiful than the aforementioned two, like Ryma (Brianne Leary) in ""Planet of the Slave Girls"" or Nyree (Liberty Godshall)in ""Planet of the Amazon Women."" Needless to say, ""Buck Rogers"" scores the highest possible points on the female front, particularly the 1st season.

While Thom Christopher doesn't appear in the pilot movie or the 1st season, he's a regular in the 2nd season and a highlight. He had the potential for greatness, like Spock, but it was never fully realized because the series lacked the great writing and rewriting of the creators of Star Trek (e.g. Gene Roddenberry, Dorthy Fontana and Gene Coon). Star Trek alumnus, Barbara Luna, is breathtaking as Hawk's wife, Koori, in two episodes of the 2nd season.

Speaking of the 2nd season, it's more dramatic than the 1st season with a more Trek-ian format and delivery, but it's still unmistakably Buck Rogers. There are less space babes and more attempts at serious space drama. Although it's generally inferior to the 1st season, it's superior in some ways and has it's quality episodes, like ""Time of the Hawk,"" ""Journey to Oasis,"" ""Mark of the Saurian,"" ""The Hand of Goral"" and ""The Dorian Secret.""

Then there's the curiously phallus-looking Twiki, a somewhat lovable robot who takes a backseat in the 2nd season to a more ""Short Circuit""-looking robot (of course that movie didn't come out for another six years).

Buck Rogers (the series) is hard to rate because, on the one hand, the cheese-factor is so high with the comic book tone, (mostly) dubious special effects and banal stories, but the main protagonists and guest stars are outstanding and somehow pull off the often lame material. It's amazing, but true. There's also something to be said for the nostalgic and innocent style of the pilot and series. Nevertheless, I can't in good conscience give ""Buck Rogers"" a higher rating.

The pilot runs about 89 minutes while the double episodes run 97 minutes and the single-episodes 48 minutes.

217823,5,6300184595,"I did not have a chance to watch this show back in the day when it was on TV as I was just about 5 years-old and it did not air in my country (Turkey). But given that I am inclined to enjoy the sci-fi shows from that era, I decided to purchase this. I kind of knew that it was not up to the par with Star Trek. It is probably more similar to Battlestar Galactica which was also produced by Glen A. Larson. Blu-ray picture quality is excellent and so is the audio. Too bad it does not have subtitles. It really bothers me that they do not include subtitles with some of the Blu-ray releases. Another minor complaint is regarding the packaging. It is designed differently from all the other box sets that I own. It is a flat box where two Blu-ray cases are inserted side by side. The box is not made of very cheap material but it is not a strong sturdy box set material that are typically used in box sets. The box is covered from all sides, so you need to open the tab from the side to remove the Blu-ray cases. If you maintain your Blu-ray cases inside the box, the piece where you open the box will wear out pretty badly in time. Also, due to the shape of the box, it is not easy to place it in your bookcase because if you place it standing up it is a long box and will take a lot of space. I wish they designed it like some of the other box sets with a thick and sturdy material and open from one side to make it easier to take out the Blu-ray cases.",1492214400,2,1453,3.962457337883959

Picture quality is good but I couldn't help noticing how much the sound quality is far superior  than previous releases.
The guest star list for this show is impressive and adds to the show.
Second season ends the series abruptly and without finality. TV shows rarely got and ending back then. This show deserved  better treatment than what it got.
Of course everything looks dated and the special effects look cheap and are repetitive from episode to episode.

217827,5,6300184595,Seeing Buck Rogers in true HD was a surprise treat as I never expected this series to get a 1920x1080 film scan treatment. The image looks much better than SD DVD. Unfortunately the theatrical movie version of episodes 1 and 2 did not get a proper HD transfer which is kind of odd since it would not have cost much more and would have provided a complete proper presentation. Anyhow these are listed as region B though they seem to be region free. I am happy with my purchase.

Buck Rogers I remember on T.V. Though the pilot

this on the Big Screen and enjoyed it,at age 10
I could see a HUGE diff. from this and STAR WARS
still! I enjoyed it seeing Buck shoot the bad guys
with laser guns,getting out of tight situations
ala Bond he too had his R2D2 the famous TWIGGY
(daga daga BUCCCK!) and of course you had beautiful
women! The funny part of this whole film for me is
when Buck is at the palace and everyone is dancing
dancing to some kind of obscure space music. Buck
stops the music and has the band play what else...DISC0!
Buck stars doing the hustle,the bustle and even the chicken

217942,5,6300184595,"Buck Rogers has always been about lasers and high tech up to this point, and then everything changed(for the better).  Yeah the lasers and high tech are still there(that's mandantory Buck) but the mystical becomes a part of these later series(80-81 I am guessing). Much like Dr. Who at this time period, Buck Rogers, an otherwise lighthearted show of a wise cracking Space Cowboy, becomes a hybrid of funny and downright grave. This takes place on into the Hawk series(which is not availibe except for the Guardian)  This Vampire sci-fi thriller is the best of Buck, I think.  It shows you can make a scary set with modern settings as a darkened spaceship corridor.  The soundtrack and camera angles(even in computer rooms) was downright creepy.  Wilma's(Erin Grey) personality was quite a bit different from her usual matter-of-fact self.(nice outfit)
I grew up with this show and the hybrid sci-fi/fantasy time period of other serials. And that is why I think both are important in one story.  You won't find that now(or if you do it's not as well plotted or believable).

217944,4,6300184595,"I remember the day with startling clarity - January 3, 1980...the day I became a man. Okay, a little history for you sci-fi afficionados:Before there was Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, or Star Trek:  Fill-in-the-Blank...there was Buck Rogers.'Buck Rogers', and it's sister show - the superior 'Battlestar Galactica' - were the only thing going for science fiction on television in 1979 and 1980.  I was just a boy, a wee lad, still in my jammies, and I loved science fiction with a vengeance.  Even at 11 years of age, I knew that 'Buck Rogers' was sub-par sci-fi...but it had one thing going for it that no other science fiction series of it's time had...It had Erin Gray. The three things that best defined 'Buck Rogers' as a series - and of my oncoming momentum into puberty - were:1)  Erin Gray2)  Spandex3)  Erin GrayFrankly, the rest of the show - the Starfighters, the laser blasts, the re-used spaceship models from 'Galactica', Gary Coleman...you could have shoved them all into a nuclear reaction and STILL the only thing that would have mattered would have been Erin Gray. Yep, I was hooked. Which brings us to January 3, 1980 - the day 'Space Vampire' premiered. Okay, it was not that good - but Erin Gray gets turned into a Vorvon (i.e. Vampire) and goes all sultry...and my little life was changed forever. Trust me.  Rent it, buy it, or tape it.

217945,4,6300184595,"Let's be honest - Erin Gray is the reason why Buck Rogers achieved the measure of success it did (both on the big screen and on TV).  This movie was originally a TV pilot that was rushed into theaters to see how much money it could make, and it shows.  Even the incidental music betrays its TV origins.  But despite that (or because of), this gem is almost a 5-star rater.  Reason one is the wonderful opening credits where Buck Rogers awakes on a neon-lit walkway surrounded by beautiful futuristic (1979 futuristic, that is) women who pout and kiss him while the goofy song ""Suspension"" blares away.  A classic opening.  Reason Two - Erin Gray.  Like Diana Rigg in the 60s, Gray was the unattainable class-act who seemed to transcend the screen.  There is a Reason Three, but that's just minor stuff like the fact that Buck in the 25th is, simply, one of the funnest things a person can experience.  It's B-stuff, no doubt.  But man, is it good B-stuff.  And also, there's Erin Gray.",994809600,4,985,4.5397727272727275

7804218,4,6300184595,"I remember the series from my youth. I like the first season of Buck Rogers better than the second. The second season has too many similarities to Larson's other series Battlestar Galactica(which I prefer to this show) and the original Star Trek. He wasn't nicknamed Glen 'Larceny' for nothing. However, Larson was involved in one of my all-time favorite television shows, Magnum P.I.",1523491200,,384,5.111111111111111

7804225,4,6300184595,"I purchased ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: Complete Series"" in November. Having owned the DVD version of the series for years, the high-definition pictures was refreshing. The higher definition picture showed details in the sets and costumes that were not clear before.

The only disappointment I have is that the packaging said ""Limited Edition"" and, yet, it came only with the season one and season two sets. No posters or any other trinkets that would differentiate this Limited Edition from the separate Season One and Season Two Blu-ray sets.

The special features are strewn over the two seasons' individual sets. The features include the following:

Bonus Theatrical Version of the Pilot episode (in Standard Definition);
Bonus Feature-length version of Flight Of The War Witch (in Standard Definition);
Ending and Opening sequences for 2-part version of Awakening;
Bonus Syndicated 2-part version of Journey to Oasis (in HD);
Opening Titles without narration;
Textless Opening and Closing Titles; and
Isolated Music & Effects Audio Track on each episode.

There are no special interviews, Making-of documentaries or any of the other usual bonus features found on other ""Limited Edition"" Blu-ray sets but just to see this classic sci-fi show in high definition is worth the price.

In conclusion, the Limited Edition box looks nice but I would buy the individual Blu-ray seasons even if you save just $5.",1518220800,4,1414,5.266666666666667
7804226,4,6300184595,"As others have said, this is a nice transfer and this complete set is just the two single sets in a long box that is difficult to store on a shelf.

Be aware that this is region free but was produced in New Zealand.  The box says ""Region B PAL"".  However it is region free but the ""Standard Definition"" content may not play on some US machines.  The ""Standard Definition"" content is at 25p, which is not a US standard.  I have two HD tvs each with their own blu ray player.  Everything plays fine on the newer setup, but the older one will not play the SD content.  That is because they do not support the frame rate.  There was another reviewer saying they had trouble playing some content, this is the reason.

The HD content plays fine on US TVs because it is at 24p, which all US TVs support.  All commercial film was shot at 24 frames per second. That is the film standard and is supported everywhere.  So if you have new equipment, you can probably play everything.  If it is older, or cheaper equipment, it may not play the SD content.

One more note, the SD content runs at 25 fps.  The original film was 24 fps.  What they did in the conversion is made the film run at 25 fps.  The result is that everything runs slightly fast.  What is noticeable is that everyone's voice is a higher pitch.  This is most noticeable when Buck is talking.  You can easily hear it by switching between the SD and HD versions of the pilot.

What we really need is a real US release with extras.  Until that happens, this is still a nice set.",1517529600,10,1531,4.228373702422146
