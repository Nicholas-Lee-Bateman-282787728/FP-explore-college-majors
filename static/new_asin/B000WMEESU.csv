Rodolfo is a CLIFF DIVER AT THE FAMOUS TOURISTIC LA QUEBRADA, a dangerous occupation that barely pays him to survive so he becomes an opportunistic young man who stops at nothing for money. To add to his troubled life his girlfriend Maria, also a poor girl from the port area, gives Rodolfo the unespected news that she is pregnant with his child. What evolves from this point is a story about moral responsibility & choices for these two young people whose lives are forced to the brink of murder. Again, excellent acting by Mr. DE ANDA & THE VERY TALENTED Ms. CONDE. She retired early from her acting career while still a young woman.
