8216603,1,B000A2VC1E,"I just started looking for the old Roy Rogers movies on DVD. After buying a few I found that there are some really sorry copies around. After consulting with the IMDB I also found that most have been edited down to 54 minutes. Some from 80 minutes to 54 minutes. This was done in the 50's so the movies would fit in a TV time slot. I assume that the edited parts are for the most part songs but I never was a fan of cutting up a movie, as it can change the western musical to just a plain old shoot-em-up.
This DVD contains 5 movies, all edited, on a cheap DL DVD. I can't even watch the last movie...my player just locks up when I try.  Small loss.
They seem to be from the Happy Trails junk, as all have someone intro-ing the movie before it starts. The opening Republic logo has been removed and the closing Republic logo also.

Apache Rose is listed as 75 minutes (75 min original version)
It runs 56 minutes.

Bells of San angelo is listed as 71 minutes 78 min original version)
This is the one I can't watch, but it starts without the Republic logo, I'm not sure about the length.

The Arizona Kid (61 min original version), Song of Arizona (68 min (original version)and Sherrif of Tombstone (56 min Original version) are all 54 to 56 minutes. The edited for TV ones.

All have an annoying little MM&V logo (Marathon Music & Video) in the lower right corner of the video. (Personally I wouldn't claim anything to do with this mess, much less initial it for all to see.)",1197763200,14,1475,4.272401433691757
