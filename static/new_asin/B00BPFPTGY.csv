8572246,5,B00BPFPTGY,My son was very happy to receive this as a Christmas present off his wishlist. I haven't watched it and have no opinion other than that.,1394496000,,136,4.269230769230769
8572247,5,B00BPFPTGY,"I've been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for a long time. I'm glad they decided to take classic MLB moments and record them to DVD. This does not play like a usual DVD - you won't get any ""extras"" or a menu or anything because it is recorded directly from the archives. The picture quality is great and I'm very satisfied. Now I can finally dump my VCR and not worry about purchasing any VHS-to-DVD recording equipment myself.",1383868800,,436,4.329268292682927
8572248,5,B00BPFPTGY,"I thought this was going to be exact footage, inning by inning, of each game in the World Series. It is NOT. Instead what the MLB created is a retelling of the story, using highlights from all the big plays (10 or so each game) intertwined with player/coach commentary. It was cool to see footage from back then--I'd forgotten just how good that Indians lineup was, and I'd also forgotten how dorky Greg Maddux looks off the field.

 I'd recommend this to anyone who had an interest in the 95 series.",1373328000,7,500,4.483516483516484
