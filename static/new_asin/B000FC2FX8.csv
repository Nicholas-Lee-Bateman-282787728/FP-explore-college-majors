2560362,5,B000FC2FX8,"There is really no way to describe this movie excpet outstanding.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  You find yourself rooting for Tsotsi despite all the bad things he has done.  The movie shows that even the people that appear to be the worst criminals can have big hearts.  Tsotsi simply had a string of bad luck and his troubled childhood lead him to a life of crime.  Tsotsi is able to re-discover himself through the baby he steals, through a homeless man he meets, and his friend that he beats nearly to death.  You will find yourself falling in love with all the characters especially Tsotsi in the movie.  One would think its hard to find yourself so touched by a thug like Tsosti, but the movie makes it impossible not to feel the good intentions and the goodness Tsotsi truly holds. It's impossible not to be touched by the beauty of the film.  I have always enjoyed movies about South Africa, but this one is truly a gem.  Don't miss this movie or you will be disappointed.  And don't worry the subtitles aren't even an issue the African language spoke in the film actually adds to the movie.

Here's a quick summary of the movie:

Tsotsi is a thug in every manner that kills, steals, and robs people because thats all he knows.  He grew up living on the streets after his mother died and he ran away from home.  Despite all the terrible things Tsotsi has done in his life you can constantly see his humanity.  When out on one of his normal crime sprees Tsotsi shoots a woman and steals her car and discovers later that there is a baby in the backseat.  He has no idea what to do with the baby or how to take care of him. The rest of the movie is about Tsosti's journey to re-discover who he truly is and while doing so he helps those around him that need help the most.",1153958400,3,1787,4.28955223880597
2560363,3,B000FC2FX8,"Not to be confused with the Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange vehicle, Tsotsi is, in essence, a South African take on City Of God - with important differences.  City Of God was a brilliant descent into Rio's teenage gang life, visually mesmerizing and authentic.  Tsotsi shares the ability to take its viewers to a truly otherworldly environment, in this case the sub-culture of Johannesburg's shantytown.  (There are many unforgettable images, including the cement culverts that Tsotsi once called home.)  The movie succeeds on this level.

Not to belabor the point, Tsotsi steals a car, shoots the car's owner in the abdomen, and discovers a baby in the back seat.  (Just recently his gang has savagely murdered a commuter for beer money.)  At this point, if Tsotsi really were Tsotsi, he would either leave the baby to die or drop it off in front of an affluent-looking house.  But the film needs its gadget, so - ridiculously - he keeps the infant.  Even the dimmest viewer will deduce that Tsotsi's inability to provide care reflects a childhood that was, to say the least, unkind.  Viewers understand that when Tsotsi looks at the innocent child he sees himself, and so, for the first time, develops some semblance of humanity.  (No one will be seated during the ""mother forced to nurse another woman's offspring at gunpoint"" scene!)

One can feel sorrow, even empathy, for a young punk so crippled that he believes all problems can be solved with violence or money.  One can look at the landscapes of deprivation and squalor and wonder, ""If I had to endure that, would I have morals, or would I pack steel and live a life of savage social Darwinism?""  These are good questions, and the vivid photography and sense of place encourage viewers to ask them.  But the metamorphosis, or at least, nascent metamorphosis, of Tsotsi from brutal street thug to inept, conscience-driven nanny is beyond nutty, it belongs in the province of fairy tales.",1153785600,5,1944,4.884146341463414
2560364,5,B000FC2FX8,"""Tsotsi"" is a major achievement, not merely in the performances onscreen, but in especially intelligent direction. For positive proof of this, the viewer should observe the alternate endings and deleted scenes with director Gavin Hood's commentary ON. He explains the choices made and what ultimately led to them in such a way that I am eager to seek out more of his work. I think this is the first time that I can say with no hesitation that the director actually made ALL of the right decisions for ALL of the right reasons, rather than being blindsided by his own ego.

The non-professional actors are top-notch as well, and their inexperience lends authenticity to their roles. ""Tsotsi"" is not a suitable vehicle for a high-profile prima donna actor.

I mention these things rather than the plot itself, which one can read about in other reviews. But by all means, see ""Tsotsi"" for yourself, and form your own opinions.",1153612800,3,923,4.8354430379746836
2560365,5,B000FC2FX8,"***THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***

Many movie reviewers view foreign language films with a smidgin of contempt. There's an underlying current of the ""why do we have to put up with these things"" type mentality, especially from U.S. reviewers. It's not entirely self-evident when reading these reviews, but you get that feeling deep down that American film makers, producers, marketers, and reviewers swallow these foreign film pills with a hint of displeasure. I'm sure much of that discomfort comes from the fact that some of these films drain a certain percentage of money out of their deep pockets. Personally, I say ""More power to `em!""

The reason I bring this up is because TSOTSI is one of those films that could've taken off in the American mainstream had it had a significant marketing budget. It did, after all, win multiple film festival awards, snagged the American Film Institutes Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize Special Mention, as well as picking up an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. But because of the mentality of movie makers in the fabulously wealthy Hollywood arena, marketing of these vitally important foreign imports often gets hamstrung in favor of such film dregs as DATE MOVIE and THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN. I don't say these things without any source. Go up and ask your average young adult or teenager about TSOTSI and they'll more often than not simply stare at you as if you'd just requested they give you the mathematical equation for nuclear fission.

There's something to be said for these low-budget films (although I'm not sure what TSOTSI's shooting costs were, I feel confident it didn't come close to the two dregs I mentioned above). These little-known gems give us stories that go beyond our normal film viewing range. And TSOTSI is one that I'm proud to say I watched with joy (this is a also disturbing and I'll tell you why in a moment).

Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae) is a thug in South Africa. He's your typical amoral gangster who doesn't have a shred of ""decency"" in his young body. He also has a group of stragglers who follow him around like puppies, putting pressure on Tsotsi to come up with their evening's entertainment; they steal, they rob, they kill. But one day, when Tsotsi decides to do a job by himself, he makes a moral mistake (and I mean he makes a mistake according to his own moral code, which is to say he causes something good to come out of something terrible). He shoots a woman after stealing her car and drives away with a new BMW. But as he travels awkwardly down the road (he doesn't drive very well) he hears a cooing sound in the backseat. Startled, he turns around and discovers a baby in a carseat. Initially unsure of what to do, he takes the baby home with him and nurtures the child as best he can (which isn't very good). He soon learns that he has to watch the baby closely; ants attack the infant, and it gets hungry and poops constantly and needs to be bathed. Tsotsi forcibly procures the assistance of a widowed neighbor who recently had a child. He convinces the woman -- at gunpoint -- to breast feed the child and threatens to kill her if she tells anyone about him and the baby. A strange relationship develops between these two as the film progresses.

Torn by his own poor upbringing, Tsotsi has to decide what to do with the child when he learns that its mother is still alive. The police, too, are closing in on him and his gang of thugs have disbanded. Tsotsi's choice to care for the child has put him on a path of physical destruction, but has also led him to deeper choices, those of compassion and morality.

In the end, Tsotsi battles his internal demons in order to make the right choice for the baby, and it's a startling realization. We watch a person we absolutely loathed in the beginning of the film turn ever so slightly into a ""decent"" young man, and it's disturbing as a viewer (for me, at least) to empathize with someone initially devoid of humanity. But that's where TSOTSI succeeds and so many American films fail. American movies want you to see most things in black and white (""Here's the good guy and here's the bad""). But TSOTSI brings us into these lives and does so without spoonfeeding us what's right and what's wrong. The gray areas are sweeping and uncomfortable, something that packs an emotional wallop at the end of the film (I was bubbling like an idiot as tears streamed down my cheeks).

TSOTSI deserves the little notoriety it's received. In fact, it deserves much, much more.",1153440000,13,4525,4.64875
2560366,4,B000FC2FX8,"A gritty, touching story about redemption in a world of abject violence
and poverty in the outer reaches of Johannesburg, South Africa.

Strong performances by a cast of mostly unknowns.

(SPOILER) Lead actor Presley Chweneyagae will disgust you with his
cold-blooded violent ways and then will gain your sympathy as he
realizes the wrongs he has done. His performance is hauntingly
excellent.

A compelling film for international audiences, although the harsh
language and vivid brutality of Tsotsi and his band of thugs will
offend some viewers. Its nomination for an Academy Award as Best
Foreign Film is well deserved.

Strong 4 stars.",1153440000,,639,5.235294117647059
2560367,5,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi is one of the intense films I have ever seen.  In every moment an emotional explosion is in the making.  The story concerns a young, ruthless, petty gangster in the poor settlement of Soweto on the outskirts of Johannesburg.  Without giving too much away, the movie begins with a senseless and brutal murder and Tsotsi is introduced as a vicious thug without a trace of remorse. But, when he accidentally acquires a baby, a wellspring of memories of a tortured childhood open up for him.

The young man playing Tsotsi is not a professional actor, but does a superb job in the role.  Another star of the show is the ghetto of Soweto with its patched- together houses, long lines at communal wells, drugs and drink -- in short a mass of seething humanity.  A redemptive feature of this environment is a young mother Tsotsi meets who is decent, pleasant and will probably slowly make her way out of the worst of ghetto life.  The prospect is not one of unrelieved pessimism.

White people play little role in this movie.  A police inspector on the trail of Tsotsi is the only major white character.  Tsotsi and his colleagues prey on their own kind, who appear for the most part to be ""colored"" in the racial parlance of South Africa.  ""Tsotsi"" is beautifully made, with not a wasted moment. The atmosphere is one of steadily building tension toward an nail-biting climax.

Smallchief",1148083200,8,1388,4.690082644628099
2560368,5,B000FC2FX8,"Though ""Tsotsi"" is set in South Africa and the milieu, to the American eye, is as exotic as a film set on the Moon, the concerns are Universal: the loss or disconnect of ones parents, the longing for a parent's love and caring, a governments lack of concern for a citizens civil rights.

Tsotsi (Presley Chweneygae) is a hood, a young man who kills and steals without any apparent concern for what he is doing and why he is doing it. His face and eyes radiate mostly hate and disdain. He is psychically and emotionally detached and removed. Then, one day he steals a luxury car, shoots the woman to whom it belongs and realizes, once he drives the car away, that there is an infant in the back seat.

This beautiful, innocent child forces Tsotsi ( really named David) to face the loss of his Mother, the uncaring, drunken non-concern of his father and the deep seated, mostly ignored or glossed , psychically ignored feelings with which he hasn't been able to deal.

Director and screenwriter Gavin Hood (adapted from a novel by Athol Fugard) has fashioned a traditionally structured film and peopled it with non-traditional characters and it works because we can all relate to Tsotsi's dilemma. And it doesn't hurt to have Presley Chweneygae as your lead character. The first time we see Tsotsi on screen he looks at the camera with his huge black eyes: eyes that are filled with superiority, despair, disgust and hurt. When he first sees the infant his eyes and face fill with wonder and awe at the utter helplessness and innocence. It is this disparity and friction that makes the film crackle with fire and well observed life.

""Tsotsi"" is not a revolutionary film like say the similarly themed ""Children of God"" but it is a very emotionally effective and socially aware one and Presley Chweneyagae's performance is so natural and truthful that it makes you wince with recognition and empathy.",1145318400,23,1897,4.739393939393939
2560369,5,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi, who has named himself for the Afrikaans word for ""gangster"", is a ringleader of a four-thug gang.  He is numbed by a horrific childhood past and lives in present-day Soweto, a township on the outskirts of Johannesburg.  He executes violent operations swiftly and mechanically, without emotion or remorse, until he accidentally kidnaps the baby of a wealthy couple  during a car-jacking.  The needs of the baby spark in Tsotsi his  dormant humanity.

The portrayal of Tsotsi's transformation into a caring provider is as gritty as it is real, as is the entire context, dialogue, cinematography and overall delivery of this unsentimental and jarring but uplifting film.  Any visitor to  Soweto or Alexandria can testify to the rare and uncolored window this extraordinary film provides into aspects of youth poverty in today's South Africa.  And anyone who experiences this superbly rendered film will be able to testify to the powerful deliverance of its premise: that beauty and love arise in the harshest of places.",1145059200,5,1024,5.195121951219512
2560370,4,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae), a small time thug, runs with his small gang of delinquents, in a slum in South Africa. Every day, Tsotsi's three pals show up on his doorstep, looking for some direction, some meaning. One of their ""jobs"" takes them to a large subway station where Tsotsi spies a businessman paying a vendor with cash from his pay envelope. They follow the mark onto a train and the robbery does not go as planned. This is the first incident which will cause the small time thug to begin reevaluating his life. Later, he travels, alone, to an affluent suburb of Johannesburg and waits for someone to come home. As the rain pours down, he spots a BMW drive into a driveway. The female driver runs out of the car, into the rain, trying to get her husband to open the malfunctioning gate. Tsotsi rushes up and car jacks the vehicle, leaving the screaming woman behind. He soon discovers the reason for her frantic pleas.

""Tsotsi"", written and directed by Gavin Hood, and based on a novel by Athol Fugard, is a very good film, and a worthy entry by South Africa in this year's race for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.

The film is about Tsotsi, the changes he makes in his life and the reasons for these changes. He starts off as an amoral, violent thug who doesn't think twice about killing someone for a couple of dollars. He leads his ragtag group of followers, people who are even more desperate than he is, and who are willing to follow him into any situation. Clearly, this makes Tsotsi feel important and he rules them with a scornful frown, the threat of violence always near.

Even though he thinks nothing of killing someone for a few dollars, it is the murder of the businessman which is the turning point. Tsotsi begins to feel maybe there is something wrong here, with him, with his world, with everything. As this change happens, he still acts out, threatening people, harming them, even as he seeks their help or guidance. More telling, these people help him, recognizing the troubled person deep beneath the tough guy surface. At one point, he seeks the help of a single mother, who provides what he wants, but he still finds it necessary to have his gun ready, and waiting. As the story progresses, these feelings of conflict grow and grow, becoming more consuming within him, confusing him even more. Soon, he has to decide which way to go. Will he continue as a criminal or make some effort at reform?

Writer/ Director Gavin Hood manages this process well. At no point do we ever feel Tsotsi will ever be a normal human being, but there are definitely shades of progress throughout. As people offer unlikely guidance and help, he seems to soften a bit here and there, but being a tough guy is all he has ever known. It may be all he ever can be and he desperately clings to his tough guy persona. The film shows us this in a believable way. If he simply became an angel, we wouldn't believe in his transformation, or care about the outcome of his situation. The change is gradual, painful and believable.

Because the transformation is gradual, and still stained by his violent upbringing, we care about his fate. Chweneyagae leads an impressive cast of unknowns (at least in this country) who bring these characters to life. He convincingly portrays Tsotsi's menace and foreboding attitude. He doesn't speak a lot, but his facial expressions display a lot of menace; he merely stares at someone and they shrink back, afraid of the repercussions. At one point, he brutally beats a member of his gang and we suddenly have evidence of what he is capable of.

Most of this film seems drained of theatricality, giving us the impression we are watching a documentary. The one moment that rings slightly false is when Tsotsi takes his gang back to the home of the car jacking victim. They rob the house, holding her husband hostage. Two of the gang members are not quite as believable and appear too cartoonish as they threaten the poor man. This scene seems clearly influenced by American action films and doesn't mesh completely with the rest of the film.

The final scene is very memorable and very moving. You'll have to watch the film to actually find out why. I can't spoil it for you. This is one of those films that are difficult to review. If I talk too much, I'll ruin the impact and give away things that you should experience in the theater.

""Tsotsi"" is a very good film, worthy of Academy Award consideration. You would be hard pressed to find a film with more believable characters and a more moving story.",1144195200,10,4554,4.606658446362515

2560402,5,B000FC2FX8,"""Tsotsi"" is a truly unforgettable film from 2005. It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The director is Gavin Hod. The novel is by Athol Fugard and the screenwriter is Gavin Hood. Actors include Presley Chweneyagae, Terry Pheto, Kenneth Nkosi and Mothusi Magano. Tsotsi is gorgeous, riveting, poignant, and thrilling. Not only is it a first-rate piece of storytelling, but it also takes the viewer into a world of South African poverty and crime that he has never seen before. Director/writer Gavin Hood offers us a tale of tragic redemption and uncommon poetry in a subculture of the most abject immorality. Truly unforgettable. The only work in recent times to which this movie can be compared is City of God. There, too, the viewer is brought into a world of poverty and crime he probably never knew existed. It is a world so bleak that it forces the viewer to examine his own morality and wonder how much of the civility he takes for granted in his life is merely the luxury of the well fed and comfortable.

*[note: he was playing ""Puck""]

I've never seen anything like this film. No wonder it won so many well-deserved awards. What this young actor can do without any words at all; with just his facial expressions... and the mother who nursed the baby, too... all the actors, really. Every one of them.

I am practically speechless. Mesmerising is the word. 10+ stars. No wonder it won so many well-deserved awards. I was looking for more about this young actor and came upon this review. Thank you, Olukayode, for describing it all so much better than I ever could.

2560442,4,B000FC2FX8,"This is an update on Athol Fugard's novel in time and context, though its premise has been retained.  Fugard, as a ""secular Christian,"" presents the redemption of a thoroughly dehumanized ""native boy"" - the very archetype apartheid was created to contain - and thereby demonstrates not only the dehumanization that created him, but the path to redemption for all South Africa.  Pretty sweeping stuff, but Fugard pulled it off by not descending into mawkish religious/political tropes. This film retains that edge.  David the tsotsi starts off as the hard-nosed little killer, but cracking first under fellow-thug Boston's goading and then his abduction of the baby, we see the armor peel painfully from his soul, layer by rusty layer.

I give it four rather than five stars, however, because the deleted scenes should have been retained.  The final ending left us up in the air as much as David's hands.  In the director's cut edition are included two alternate endings, one where he is shot, and the other where he escapes.  The escape ending is better, but ultimately we're still left hanging.  The execution ending, however, gives closure.  The symbolism of David's blood mingling with the spilled milk, though heavy, is effective: the flow of life in bitter mixture on the ground.  In this update the injustice of poverty itself - rather than its racist aspect - is the true killer, not David.",1349740800,,1397,4.982758620689655

2560447,5,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi

This movie is about a young man named David AKA ""Tsotsi"" that lives in Johannesburg South Africa. He became the head lider of a gang in order to survive. This town is a very poor town in South Africa and has a large population of poverty; it shows how the black people used to live in concentration camps. David ran away from his home when he was a child because his mother was dying and his dad was an abusive alcoholic. David lived in the streets along with other kids that had either lost their parents or ran away too. The members of his gang were kids that lost their families and had to join the gang in order to survive. The movie emphasizes the social class division. It shows how blacks were rejected because of their skin color and their social economic status. One of David's gang members studied to become a teacher but when it was time for him to take the exam to become a professional teacher he couldn't take it because he couldn't pay for the exam. That's why many people had to do the bad in order to get money. Because of all the hunger and mistreats from living in the streets that David had he had to be another person in order to kill, rob and kidnap people to get money. It was only when David did a car robbery that accidentally ended up with a baby. Then he became again the old David, which was that little boy which had nothing in his live. He kept the baby and wanted to take care of him and become the best father, but he couldn't keep it any longer because that baby had his family which was desperate to be with him again. Finally he returned the baby to his family and went to jail.

2560448,4,B000FC2FX8,"Going in to the film Tsotsi, I had no idea what to expect. I was surprised by the film because it was both extremely gritty and heartwarming at the same time. At the beginning of the film, I was saddened by Tsotsi's lack of normal human emotions. He seemed to not have a heart at all. But after he accidentally kidnaps a woman's child, he begins to develop a heart. To me, this was kind of like a modern day Grinch story. Tsotsi went from being a heartless murderer, to a man who tried to protect a baby and his parents. This film was, at times, very difficult to watch because there was so much hurt. Emotionally and physically, the people in the film seemed to be hurt over and over again. One of the hardest scenes to watch is when Tsotsi is remembering when his father killed his dog. Another reason that this film was somewhat hard to watch was just the gritty feel that it had. One scene in particular bothered me. Tsotsi has the baby in his house and he leaves him with a can of juice. Tsotsi leaves for the day, seemingly forgetting about the baby, and returns to find the baby covered in bugs and sticky juice. I think what holds this film together and makes it worth watching is seeing how Tsotsi is transformed through out the film. By becoming friends with a local mother, Tsotsi is able to see how a baby needs the love and attention of a mother. The possibility that Tsotsi may actually have a heart keeps the audience interested. By showing both the wealthy and the poor of Africa, the film seems to say that people can relate on such fundamental levels as the need for love and acceptance.",1305072000,,1605,4.3533333333333335
2560449,5,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi is a powerful, powerful film. I haven't seen a lot of South African Cinema but this film is really something. The story is so moving and the acting is superb. I think that because I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, the film was all the more special and delicate. The characters were believable and the story was so touching, so moving and so surprisingly realistic. I plan to watch more films by Gavin Hood because of this film. I personally thought the lead character, Tsotsi to be rather feminine at times. I thought this helped in making his character really reach the masses. He is a character that is both sensitive and fiercely cruel; an odd pairing but a pairing that works. I personally thought the part when Tsotsi drives off with the baby to be a bit much, almost too much for me to handle, but as the story progressed it made the film (obviously) and it made the film gripping `til the end. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film was the music that accompanied it... it was fitting and true to the mood of the different parts of the film. I thought it was rather interesting how the music would be incorporated too, in that sometimes it was jarring and interruptive, but ultimately, it proved to work for the film given that the film was told as a cause and effect sort of way. I would watch this film again and again; I absolutely loved this film. I am a big foreign film fan and this one has taken the cake this year. The directing, cinematography, music, script, acting, etc, was superb. I recommend this to all any day of the week. I cannot express any higher praise for a film.

The movie keeps the sentimentality in check and reminds the viewer of Tsotsi's desperate circumstances (especially in one scene where he robs the house of the family whose baby he has stolen).

2560463,4,B000FC2FX8,"I rented and watched ""Tsotsi"" because I had just read the novel. I read the novel because I had just seen a stage production of a play by Athol Fugard. I suppose that, if and when a TV series depicting the later life of Tsotsi/David is produced, I'll watch that too.

The play was the best. The acting was superb. The script was brilliant, though I personally can't follow Fugard into his religious ecstasy. The novel was an early, unfinished effort by Fugard -- very powerful and revelatory, though the ending was botched badly. The film is only ""freely"" based on the novel, but the ending is still botched. It sentimentalizes the novel excessively, with a soundtrack that should get its music director some kind of cheap plastic Oafscar for banality. I don't know what I might have thought of the film if I hadn't read the book. I don't know what I would have thought of the novel if I hadn't seen a couple of Fugard's later plays. I suspect that I would have been incredulous.

The film has definite strengths. The acting is extraordinary; given what he's called upon to do by the director, Presley Chweneyage delivers a topnotch performance as the Thug (Tsotsi means ""thug"" in the South African patois of the film). The supporting roles are even better played. The kidnapped baby should definitely have received a solid gold Oscar for Supporting Actor. The camera delivers also; the images of a ""township"" slum are unforgettable, and the contrasting images of wealth in Johannesburg are like a punch in the stomach. The film Tsotsi updates the novel from the apartheid era of Fugard's youth to the disappointing modern era of AIDS and the uneradicated misery of poverty. But, unlike the novel, the film treats sociological/historical matters only as the periphery of the personal drama of Thug's awakening of ""decency.""

That awakening is probably implausible, if you think about it too analytically. But Hey! ""Suspension of Disbelief"" is the master key to most movies, right?",1267920000,2,1980,4.869436201780416

2560469,1,B000FC2FX8,"One of those films that everyone seems to admire, `Tsotsi' is a film that I can't rally behind.  I have to speak my piece here and contribute an opinion that differs from the masses that seem to have nothing but praise and admiration for this film.  Gavin Hood's film is stylishly directed and shot, and it is pretty well acted; but the script is a very, very week point that brings the film down to a mediocre level, diminishing the very moral that Hood was trying to bring to the light.

It somewhat contradicts itself.

This may contain some SPOILERS so be forewarned.

In `Tsotsi', Hood tells us the story of David, a thug who enforces his status by killing mercilessly and even going as far as to beat his friends if he feels his dignity is in question.  He has apparently no morals whatsoever so when we see him pull out a gun and shoot a woman for her car, it doesn't faze us because we expect this from him.  What happens next is a tad unexpected.  David realizes that there is a baby in the backseat.

Now, I'm not trying to judge because, well, I don't like to do that, but Hood creates a monster in David that he seems quick to try and dispel.  David immediately decides to care for this child.  This didn't make much sense to me, since David's personality was not of the nurturing kind, and all too often we read of actually people of this persuasion who would kill a child as apposed to care for it; so his decision makes little sense, especially in the immediacy of it all.  What happens next though is an even bigger question mark.  It's apparent that Hood has now changed our central character from a merciless killer to a nurturing would-be-father who apparently cares for the boy, but he then depicts David breaking into the home of the parents in order to rob them for necessary items to care for the boy.  This is another headscratcher.  So he starts off a monster, then he suddenly shifts into a caring person but then, in order to be `caring' he pains the same family he's already nearly destroyed by robbing them at gunpoint.  It was at that point in the film that I lost any and all respect for the story.  I was finally starting to wrap my head around the idea of this young man maybe being more conflicted than evil, more conditioned than anything else, and that maybe this young baby brought another side of him to light; but the decision to rob the boy's parents of all people was one that I could never understand.  Then he pulls yet another one-eighty and delivers the baby to the parents.  It's almost as if Hood wasn't sure what kind of person David really was.

He's a menace, but he's sentimental, but he evil, yet he's moral, but he corrupt yet he does the right thing...

Hmmmm.

Then, on top of it all, the final confrontation with the cops and the parents and David is presented in a way where we feel almost manipulated to actually feel sorry for David.  This was a sick joke in my book, for if Hood actually thinks that this character is a representation of purity in a maniacal environment then he is sadly mistaken.  Hood presents David's eventual decision as if it were the eraser taken to his actions, as if he was redeeming himself by presenting this baby to his parents.  If he had never entered the families home with gun in hand in order to steal their child's belongings I would walk away feeling that maybe this young mans full-circle transformation was genuine, but actions speak louder than words, and Hood should have known that.

That said, Presley Chweneyagae does a fine job portraying David, and he shifts through the range of emotions (as unstable and uneven as they are) with ease, so I cannot knock him.  He actually brings more to the table than the script called for, and so I actually praise him for his efforts.  It's a shame that the script was not up to this young mans potential.

I cannot recommend this film, for to me it is an inaccurate depiction of a tragedy and it attempts to rationalize in a way that is nearly offensive.  To sympathize with David, after all that he has done, is a crime in many ways for the script never allows us to truly invest in his transformation.  He doesn't prove his heart to us, but Hood makes sure that we see his faux variation of change in those last few frames.  If you are easily persuaded by manipulated expressions of redemption then you may very well flock to David's defense; but hopefully you're smart enough to see that Hood wasn't smart enough to make this work.",1226016000,17,4476,4.4406364749082
2560470,4,B000FC2FX8,"""Tsotsi"" came onto my radar screen because of its' 2005 Oscar for Best Foreign-Language films.  I have come to appreciate that the five films nominated in that category are often better, overall, than the five films nominated in any other category that year.  ""Tsotsi"" reaffirms that appreciation.  This is a movie that grabs your attention right from the beginning.  We are quickly made aware of just how bad a person this Tsotsi is.  He's so bad, even one of his comrades in crime admonishes him for his lack of decency.  With this brief yet telling portait of evil, the movie is able to quickly grab hold of the essential plot.

Tsotsi shoots a woman as part of a car-jacking.  After driving off in the stolen car, he becomes aware that there is a baby in the back seat.  This challenges him to make a decision.  Perhaps that earlier admonition by his partner in crime stirred something inside him.  The decision that Tsotsi makes is somewhat incomplete but it is a step towards humanity.  We see if evolve in a rather morally clumsy manner yet this enables the viewer to be more accepting of the change.  Without any spark of spiritual conversion, the evolution from evil to good requires patience.  We are drawn towards Tsotsi's redemption but many of us retain a focus on the victims; past and present.  The ending is very well done.  We sense that Tsotsi has regained that turning point in his youth that led him down the wrong path.  This time he seems ready to try a different direction.  There is a common sense of redemption as well as justice.

What impressed me the most about ""Tsotsi"" is how it said so much in such a short time.  I believe that this film lasts less than 90 minutes yet I did not feel that I was short-changed as a viewer.  The acting is good and the setting is in a world we see little of on the Silver Screen.  This movie reminded me of ""City of God"" but with a happier ending.  I waivered between 4 and 5 ""stars"" in my rating.  I guess I was thinking I've been over-rating a few too many books and movies lately.  Perhaps I'm guilty of under-rating ""Tsotsi""",1223856000,,2091,4.468253968253968

2560472,5,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi was the perfect example of how some of the misguided youth around the world can live a life of crime and no morality. Tsotsi was the leader of his small gang, which was made up of four including the main character Tsotsi. Die Aap was the quite one in the group that just agreed with whatever decision being made and went with the flow of the group. Butcher was the `hothead' the one who was quick to resort to violence. Boston is the drunken intellect that was in the slums due to his alcohol addiction. Tsotsi and his gang make a living stealing and on one night when they were ganging up on this man in a subway for his wallet `Butcher' went to far and murdered him with his ice pick. This mad everyone in the group a little uncomfortable, especially Boston that decided to go on a drunken tirade lecturing Tsotsi about the concept of decency. Unfortunately, Boston's lecturing led to him getting a beat down courtesy of Tsotsi. I loved how the gang had its balance of characters, the hot head, the silent leader, the talkative know-it-all and the follower.
 After Tsotsi was banned from the bar, because of what he did to Boston, he ran to stake out a home in a near by high class neighborhood. After just waiting a few minutes a woman came to the gat of the home and stepped out of her vehicle and that's when Tsotsi decided to steal her car but not without shooting her in the stomach when she tried to stop him. Tsotsi shooting of the woman was a ridiculous decision to make, there was no need to shoot her, he could have just pushed her out of the car and driven away. He suddenly stopped the vehicle due to the cry of a baby in the backseat of the car, Tsotsi in shock from this discovery decided to place the baby in a paper bag and take him back to his house. Tsotsi did many strange things to this child, because of his lack of knowledge on how to take care a baby. He left it sleeping in the paper bag, he gave him homemade diapers from newspaper and he fed the baby condensed milk which made the baby perfect bait for eager ants. Tsotsi abduction of the child made him a wanted man, the babies parents were on a non stop search for their missing son. Fortunately, Tsotsi found help from a new mother in town that provided the baby with the proper nutrition from her breast milk.
 Tsotsi reunite his gang and decided to go rob the house from which the baby was from in order to get supplies to care for the baby. In an unfortunate incident in the robbery Tsotsi was forced to shoot his hot headed partner Butcher, because he was about to kill their hostage after Tsotsi told him not to. After all this chaos Tsotsi made the decision to return the baby back to his family. However, in the transaction the police showed up and arrested Tsotsi in a very dramatic fashion. In my opinion, the ending of the film was terrible, I would have preferred Tsotsi getting away rather than getting arrested, because the only reason he was arrested was because he decided to stand outside the home with the baby forever.",1208649600,,3024,4.350442477876106

2560474,5,B000FC2FX8,"Set in shantytown of South Africa, a 19-year old gang member examines another side of his life, the other side of humanity as he cares for an infant.

Tsotsi was a crude gang member are at the height of destruction, killing without a conscience.  In a carjacking, Tsotsi shockingly discovers and is left with an infant separated from his mother, injured by Tsotsi.  He innocently attempts to hold on to the baby, tenderly, sweet, caring and vulnerable in the midst of gang activity. It is this time that the ganster undergoes a remarkable awakening.  The actor Presley  Cheweneyagae was outstanding, revealing every emotion on his face.

The film directed by Gavin Hood is based on a novel by Athol Fugard.  It has minimal dialogue, which means the viewer relies on descriptive settings, perfect transitions, emotional faces,  close-ups, realistic actions and most of all touching the viewer.  It's clear to see why this got the 2005 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and numerous other awards.

Features!
The DVD subtitles are easily legible, and as I mentioned, there isn't a lot of dialogue, which means we can't lose too much in translation like other films.

The Making of Tsotis and Audio Commentary
Also included is an English speaking version of the making of Tsotsi.  Excellent audio commentary is informative, insightful and educational with alternative endings.

Don't miss the extraordinary short film
What is included is a short film, also by Gavin Hood, that is so unique in that there are  no speaking roles, we rely only on what we see, what we interpret with only a few noises.  The film is the Shopkeeper,  where an old man runs a small store that has repeatedly been broken into.  See what he does next.

Soundtrack - the music toward the end!
It's not the rap music I noticed, but what was so soothing, spiritual, and haunting was the music at the end of the film, subtle but powerful.  ....Excellent film.  Rizzo",1208131200,3,1935,4.841463414634147

I usually entertain myself with the latest mainstream media garbage that's so greatly marketed at me.  With my lack of knowledge and culture for foreign films, I didn't go into watching Tsotsi with an open mind.  Upon completing the movie I can easily say that I'm glad I watched it.  I was kept entertained and interested the whole way.  I didn't even feel like a foreign film, the fact that it was all in subtitles didn't bother me as I was so engaged in the movie.  The plot definitely touches on some heavy thinking, as the main character (Tsotsi) battles his morality against his ambition to survive and make money.  You get a taste of what it's like to live in certain parts of South Africa, the ghetto's and shanties versus the middle class and well off.

Otherwise, he would have abandoned that baby in the car, but he took him and he did not let the baby just die. He rather to murder his friend than the baby's father because he knew that baby needed him and they were good parents not like his drunk father.

It is skillfully edited and well adapted exciting film illustrating what it was a style of survival in Johannesburg's townships during the years of the apartheid system: ""Tsotsi"", meaning thug or a hoodlum.
It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time representing the horrendous of the situation in which these people lived in, in an authentic and insightful way, but still controversial on its purpose of justifying the acts of a human monster and at the same time leaving him as a hope of redemption for the rest of the country. It is hard to accept this character as a product or creation of a spiteful system and not as the monster he was by his own choice. Just because a thug had encountered his humanity and his capacity to feel compassion because of a chance he had to encounter with a baby, it means that he had paid for his crimes. Under the same circumstances and pressures, there were other protagonists like the woman who was forced to breast-feed the abducted baby. She was a mother who had to fight for her own survival and also for her baby. This woman since a different perspective was able to make her living sewing and making some decorative mobiles of glass.

2560479,4,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi is a movie that I recommend to watch, but before to start talking about it, I want to clarify that it is a movie with a high content of violence for which I do not recommend it as a family plan if you have kids. This movie was inspired in the book written by Athol Fugard who was moved by what he lived in his early years in his third world country. When I started watching this movie, I thought that this was just another Hollywood type movie with French language, and elements such as fiction, drama, and violence; however, these are not just elements. This is a reflection of a reality that happens far away from here in Asia.
The economic and social problems in this town in Johannesburg were the motivations of this young individual named Tsotsi to start committing illegal actions.  The life of Tsotsi changed the day that he stole a car from a woman. This happened in the front entrance of the woman's house.  In this confrontation Tsotsi left this woman paraplegic. Tsotsi took the car with him, but he did not realize that inside of this automobile was a baby. It is hard to believe it, but this baby moved Tsotsi heart. He did everything possible to keep the baby alive. He asked for help to a single mother. At this point in the movie, I started seeing a Tsotsi more compassionate, but still carrying the gun and doing illegal things.  Tsotsi was having a conflict with himself.  He knew that what he was doing was not the correct thing. He knew that the parents of this child as well as the police were looking for this baby. He felt compassion from the baby parents, and he decided to take the baby back.
As noticed during the movie Tsotsi was brave and without fears, so he decided go in person to left the baby in front of their parent's home. At this time I could observe a Tsotsi very emotional, he did not wanted to leave the baby. This was a sign that as a human he has feelings, and he is not different in this sense to the rest of us. This movie ended with Tsotsi in front of the police, and the couple carrying their child. I recommend to everyone to watch this movie.",1205884800,,2097,4.32824427480916
2560495,4,B000FC2FX8,"This is one of those movies you would want to see at least twice because you don't want to lose track of the plot paying close attention to some of the more minor details. I mainly liked the movie because of the feel it gave to the ghettos in south Africa without necessarily making you get depressed seeing that. Tsotsi (meaning Thug) who is the main character is a man that come about being a shady character that tries to act all hard and tough because of the traumatizing experiences he had to go through during his childhood. In reality though he's a monster with a heart somewhere hidden deep inside.

The story developes with him and his gang of misfits going around making a living stealing from the wealthy to get by, then one day after a major fight with some members of his posse he stumbles upon what seems like an easy victim..... he soon realizes that his prize was a little more than he bargained for when he is left in charge of a little baby. The story then progresses as Tsotsi tries to take care of the baby while trying to maintain his tough guy image to people he knows. The story is very original in concept and the characters personality while some are sort of stereotypical (butcher) are meet with some funny/interesting ones such as AAP and the teacher. From start to finish story should keep you hooked and if you really enjoyed it you'll probably find yourself watching it again so that you can get a better feel for the background of the supporting characters and other small events that occur through the movie and see the main idea behind it if you didn't catch it the first time around (For example the crippled man at the train station.). Once again I highly recommend this story to night only get a chance to observe true south African poverty life but also experience a well thought out story with much emotion.",1205798400,,1845,4.491071428571429

The book was ghetto. At the beginning I was shocked of how poor everyone is. I cant believe tsotsi shot the babys mother and now she can never walk again. I felt bad for her. When tsotsi had that baby in his hands, that was a sign. I think it was a gift from God so he was able to change his ways and stop killing everyone. Oh my god I felt so bad about the crippled guy that couldn't walk. I thought tsotsi was literally going to kill him. I was about to cry. I liked the version of the movie definitely more than the book. I hate the way they describe everything in the book. I preferred watching the movie than the book. In the book it says for example that tsotsi changed the babys diaper and put a shirt instead like in the movie he put a newspaper on the baby. I was putting myself in tsotsi position afterwards he was getting so attached to david. The baby had nothing to do with anything. Tsotsi's parents were..well at least his father was an abuser, but his mother looked like a good mom she really wanted to be with her son. And where he was raised had a lot to do with how he acted and how he became a thug. Butcher was already crazy. He just wanted to kill everyone he could lay his eyes on. Tsotsi knew there was no more friendship continuance with him. Boston is the smart one which did actually have decency and had the courage to stand up to tsotsi and tell him how he felt when they were all at that bar. Miriam told tsotsi that her husband went to work and never came back. I think she has such an innocent soul. And such a good mother, for a moment I think tsotsi was thinking about his mother when he will go to Miriam's house to breastfeed david. The story's fiction but in the setting it was in Africa where so many people are poor and its overpopulated. When tsotsi kidnapped the baby, he didn't know what he was doing at first, he was feeding david condensed milk, and then ants were all on top of him. Miriam took david in her arms but begged tsotsi to take the baby back. She watched the new and found out that david was a kidnapped baby. And that the baby's mother could never walk again. It was super sweet how instead of tsotsi taking jewelry like butcher did, he was taking baby formula and teddy bears. Butcher had to be killed because he was so close to kill david's father. Luckily tsosti saved the fathers life, just because of the baby. But the fat guy, Aap was only eating in the moment. Tsosti apologized to boston and told him he'll help him finish school, so that's why he stole the Mercedes. Before the whole incident with the baby, tsotsi was a different person. He was evil. He has no heart, or decency as boston would say. The book has so much details comparing to the movie. I guess they wanted to make the book more edible in order for everyone to be able to read it. The crippled guy said he wanted to live as long as he can see the sunshine and warmness on his face. I think the old guy was sweet. And even if he wasn't rich or couldn't get his way around easily, he was friendly to be people who wouldn't pick on him. Tsosti gave him some money before getting on the train to give back David.",1205798400,,3160,4.165032679738562

2560498,1,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi (Gavin Hood, 2005)

Warning: here be spoilers (minor, but the review goes deeper than the box copy). If you have not yet seen the film and intend to, stop reading now.

The most intriguing thing about Tsotsi, in retrospect, is trying to figure out what the difference is between a Lifetime Original Movie and an Academy Award-winning (Best Foreign Language Film) flick. It can't be the plot, or the technical aspects of the film. There's no doubt that Presley Chweneyagae is a better actor than the male leads in most Lifetime movies (say Antonio Sabato Jr.), but is that really enough to propel an otherwise dull, predictable movie into the filmic stratosphere?

The plot: Tsotsi (Chweneyagae) leads a small gang in a Johannesburg slum. One night, he shoots a young woman in the process of jacking her car. As he's driving away, he finds that her baby is in the backseat. For the next five days, he finds redemption [cue swelling music] as he tries to figure out how to take care of the baby and get him back to his parents unharmed.

All the stupid stereotypes are here. Boy becomes bad because his upbringing was terrible. Boy has revelation that suddenly turns him into, if not a model citizen, then someone you'd consider taking home to mother (if half for the shock value). Boy realizes that his life is pointless when faced with baby. All the good old-fashioned hokum that seems genetically engineered to make the viewer feel good, even though it's nothing more than naked emotional manipulation. Even when it looks as if there's a chance for the filmmakers to break out of the Lifetime Original Movie genre with something interesting, they reach for the happy-kitty-bunny-poniness of feelgood pap.

Usually, when I see a film like this, I'm at least halfway prepared for it to be emotional claptrap. This one came out of nowhere. Obviously, the people I've been hearing all these good things from haven't seen enough Lifetime Original movies to know an example of the genre when they stumble across it. *",1201564800,2,2019,4.806916426512968

But when those untouched by the offense stand on the sidelines and cry on behalf of the offender, I'm left scratching my head. That's what this film seemed to me to be doing. And just like in real life, you can sympathize with the criminal until the moment you put yourself in the shoes of the victim. Then you'd just like to see the criminal kicked off of the planet so the rest of us can focus on being nice to each other.

But as long as you don't ask yourself how you really feel, or what these characters would really do, or why they're doing what the script has them doing, or why the f-word is used 500 times, it's an interesting movie.",1201132800,,755,4.27972027972028

I saw a few undesirable comments, and asked myself what movie were certain individuals watching?? Only to remind myself, unless certain events in your life had a detrimental affect on your life and character, I believe it's hard to relate or grasp the concept of this film. I have nothing in common with Tsotsi, but I believe pain is universally the same. How it affects each individual person and how one chooses to deal with it.

2560502,5,B000FC2FX8,"This is a touching and emotive adaptation from Athol Fugard's novel. Tsotsi, is the leader of a bunch of misfits, who live in the first stage of the social pyramid: They live in the belt of misery of Johannesburg and they try to survive stealing money here and there.

But one day, Tsotsi plans will change radically, at the moment he shoots a woman stealing her car without realizing there's a baby placed on the back seat.

This unexpected circumstance will work out as a visceral shock for him, because iot will revive many latent memories of his childhood, the presence of his ruthless father and the lack of emotive gestures: These impressions will arouse around him a sudden change of behavior.

Perhaps the most beating sequence of the film is when he returns to that house, just to watch the glamorous and joyous room of that kidnapped baby, which causes him another strong affective and emotional trauma.

Finally the redemption of this apparent  cruel and renegade human being, orphan of tenderness, will make his last act of redemption.

Since the times of Pixote (the masterpiece of Hector Babenco) we had not watched such merciless portrait around the horrid affective consequences of a human being living in the razor edge of the existence. The film has many expressive highlights, in which we will witness some distorted expressions that denote that loss of emotional center.

This film, is well photographed, but that's all it has going for it. It has a protagonist I can't remotely relate to, unlike COG where I did relate to that protagonist. I didn't care remotely about Tsotsi. He was a repugnant character, I didn't give a darn about his redemption.

It takes a special actor to, in the part of a villain, still elicit interest in the audience. Perhaps with a different lead actor, I would have disliked this film less. Not everyone is lead actor material, can carry a film, and the actor playing Tsotsi, definitely cannot. He annoyed me every second he was on screen.(what's the old joke? some people have a face for radio :) )

Murder? Carjacking and shooting a lady? Steal a baby? Use the potential jeopardy of the baby as a plot device for some moron's redemption? That's crossing a few lines too many. And once crossed had no interest in the protagonist. Which translates into having no interest in the movie.

2560504,5,B000FC2FX8,"This is a heart-wrenching movie about, basically, human decenty (and the lack thereof). It seems like it might be a simple movie about a young South African man (subtitled in English) who experiences a profound spiritual awakening upon connecting with an infant who changes his life.

Not so simple. Tsotsi is an AIDS orphan, as they are called in South Africa, and of which they are many. He HAS no ability to connect to other human beings, and his life of crime is a testimony to that. He cares about no one - no family, no friends, not even himself.

With his connection to the infant that he kidnaps (after shooting the baby's mother while stealing her car to get out of the rain), Tsotsi begins to have flashbacks to his own childhood and his own pain that begin to enlighten the viewer to what we are dealing with here.

When Tsotsi meets a young mother and forces her, at gunpoint (!) to ""feed"" the baby he doesn't even know how to feed, we realize how vacant this young man is. But he is beginning to care - enough to get the baby fed - he just doesn't know how.

We learn, through this interaction, the powerful gifts that mothers provide for their children in nurture and connection that Tsotsi has never known. He is fascinated, moved, pained, awed - as should we all be.

In time, Tsotsi makes the decision to return the baby to its mother, who is still alive, although she will never walk again. Tsotsi realizes what he has taken from them all. He will experience the loss of everything he has never known as he lets this baby go, a baby he has given his own name, David, for as long as he kept him. David, a name he never shared with anybody else, ever. He is beginning to let the world in.

One poignant scene involves a visit to where David lived as a child, where other AIDS orphans, growing in number, tell him they can't take the baby because THEY have nothing to feed him. The scene with the children is where the heart-wrenching tale begins to pivot.

Highly recommended.

The beginning sets us up for this cold-stone killer. Then after beating one of his gang nearly to death, he goes out and steals a car, shooting the woman who tries to tear the door open as he drives away. Then he learns, she was trying to get to her child who is in a babyseat in the back.

This is when the film takes a turn. The logical thing for this killer to do is just abandon baby and car and walk away. But, he takes the baby with him. Then he tries to care for it keeping it a secret from his gang members.

Now we have some flashbacks to show us Tsotsi's childhood -- and some of the reasons he's like he is. Even so he's still emotionally flat. The change to his personality as he tries to reclaim some of his humanity is a struggle and even at the end we don't know what is happening in his head and heart.

2560510,4,B000FC2FX8,"Following on the ragged coat tails of previous award stormer's such as La Haine and City of God, Tsotsi also deals with marginalised youth gangs fighting for survival, respect and... decency. A tale of redemption amid the hopeless poverty of a Soweto township the film, based on Athol Fugard's novel, tells the story of a teenager who has consigned his past and future to the dumpster and is known only as Tsosti which, roughly translated, means hoodlum or thug.

In the aftermath of a robbery Tsotsi finds he has inadvertently stolen a baby. He takes it back to his shack where his inept attempts to look after the child force him to seek out a local girl who has recently given birth. This girl, also a victim of local lawlessness, (her husband having recently been murdered) is forced by Tsotsi to feed the child. This Madonna-esque epiphany in the midst of this urban hell hole triggers Tsotsi's journey back from the brink of damnation to retrieve his lost identity and to risk all by returning the child to its family.

Presley Chweneyagae's (try saying that after a stiff Pimms) portrayal of the young gangster is at once brilliant and alarming with a permafrost glare that often suggests an unsettling femininity. The subsequent replacing of his black leather jacket for a crisp white shirt as he begins his path to redemption is somewhat trite though, but when he takes the child to the top of a hill overlooking the distant city with a gospel choir singing under a nearby tree gives us one of the films most powerful moments - for the first time we see the possibility of beauty in a landscape that has hitherto been impossibly hideous.

Just as powerful is the film's soundtrack.  In the early 80's there was much talk of `world music' and how African music in particular was about to be the next big thing. I suppose my own prejudices led me to expect an unholy marriage of Adam and the Ants and the Tarzan theme tune, when, in fact, it all sounded a bit saccharine-loaded and unexpectedly twee, and the `next big thing' became little more than the soundtrack of countless Yuppie dinner parties. Twenty years later African music may be about to gain a real foothold on the world stage due to Tsotsi's extensive use of Kwaito - a pan afro/house hybrid that merges Western electronica with the idiosyncratic grooves of post-apartheid South African Ghettos. Language barriers notwithstanding, Kwaito has the kind of attitude and swagger that really could connect with foreign audiences - and lets not forget - it was the film Blackboard Jungle which heralded in the Rock and Roll era of the 1950's and changed the world.

But then they have this character do something so completely out of character that the movie never recovers its sense.  You spend the rest of the film wondering, ""What he heck?!  Why on earth is he doing all this?""

It would be one thing if the main character's utter, befuddling turnaround ended up being explained somehow as a true fulfilment of his inner drives and hopes, but the denouement of this movie can boast no such brilliant epiphany.  (It's apparently the viewer's job to supply one.)

Instead, we're treated to the spectacle of a character violating his very nature for virtually the entire film:  at no point are we vouchsafed any explanation or justification.  Nor are we treated to any insight as to precisely how it is that Tsotsi's access of compassion reverses, expiates, or resolves an apparently interminable blotter of unimaginable villainy.  Or makes the slightest difference.

I don't have problems buying the plot of movies such as ""Star Wars,"" where spaceships wage intergalactic war, or ""Shrek,"" where ogres fraternize with  garrulous donkeys.

2560513,5,B000FC2FX8,I think that Tsotsi was a very moving and inspirational movie; very worthy of the Oscar and all the awards that it won. It is so refreshing to see a movie that isn't marred by all the gliz and glam of Hollywood. Well done Mr. Chweneyagae and cast. We hope to see more of you in the future!,1176508800,,289,4.0
2560514,5,B000FC2FX8,"Wow.  It's no wonder why Gavin Hood's adaptation of Athol Fugard's classic novel won the 2005 Oscar for Best Foreign Language film.  I was completely transfixed from beginning to end.  Presley Chweneyagae is outstanding as the scowling, young Tsotsi (aka, David), whose hardened exterior covers a soft, vulnerable core.  It's this essence which is exposed when David comes into inadvertent possession of an infant.

The DVD extras give you some real insight into Mr. Chweneyagae's acting ability - in the behind-the-scenes featurette, we see him chatting intelligently, accompanied by a broad smile, about how he read the script and expressed an immediate desire to do the role.  To transform that engaging presence into David's initially malevolent, glowering presence on screen...well, that is a fine piece of acting.

Another actor worthy of note is Mothusi Magano as 'Boston.'  His failed academic dreams sliding under the weight of alcohol, his lectures on 'decency' are the among the film's best moments.  In truth, the entire cast excels under Hood's direction and script, but Chweneyagae and Maguno are who stand out in my mind two months after seeing the film.",1176508800,,1169,5.241935483870968

2560526,5,B000FC2FX8,"Tsotsi (""Thug""), the namesake of the movie, is a predatory teenager living in the shantytowns of modern Johannesburg, South Africa. He and his gang prowl the subways., searching for rich victims to rob and (when it suits them) kill. Yet beyond Tsotsi's  sullenness and menacing glare, there is pain and perhaps even a soul. His conscience stung by a gang member's lecture on ""decency,"" Tsotsi strikes out on his own. One night, while stalking a rich black neighborhood, he steals a car and (unknowingly) an infant in the back seat.

""Tsotsi"" is a film that could easily have descended into cliche. But often as not, it plays against type. The police who chase Tsotsi are white and black, with the more compassionate cop played by the white man. Tsotsi's victims are all black -- some poor (even by South African standardss) and some very wealthy, even by Western standards. The stage is set for a crisis of conscience that is extremely personal and is set against -- not within -- the larger story of the aftereffects of South African apartheid.

Fabulous performances by Presley Chweneyagae, who plays the haunted title character, and Terry Pheto, who plays the courageous woman Tsotsi forces to care for his charge.

The film begins with his gang's murder of a subway rider, a brutal beating of his colleague who dared to raise issues of morality, and then a car-jacking. Tsotsi crashes the new car and finds a newborn baby boy in the back seat. This film won an Oscar for best foreign film, but just at this early point in the film I believe the plot becomes entirely predictable. We know that the little baby will humanize Tsotsi (he does), and that the little guy will be returned safely to his parents (he is). So, the film really hinges on Tsotsi's character development and road to redemption. I also thought the film ended somewhat ambiguously, as perhaps it should have, with Tsotsi's arrest. Director Gavin Hood clearly intends not only to tell a personal story but also to comment on the horrendous socio-economic inequalities in the post-apartheid South African townships that contributed to Tsotsi's life as a criminal.

2560529,5,B000FC2FX8,"Intrigued by this film's trailer (which I saw several times), I finally rented it, and was very pleasantly surprised. It was not what I'd expected, and had the added advantage of resting on the firm foundation of an Athol Fugard novel. I've seen several Fugard plays (including Master Harold...and the Boys, 1987; and Blood Knot, 1964) and have always found his work excellent.

Presley Chweneygae gives an outstanding performance as Tsotsi, a Soweto hooligan who thinks nothing of committing theft and murder, which for him are all in a night's work, with his three followers, Soekie (Thembi Nyandeni), Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe) and Boston (Mothusi Magano). The last of these is the most recent recruit; Boston gets sick when Butcher silently murders a businessman in a packed subway car, with an ice pick. When the car empties of passengers at the last stop, the men steal their victim's wallet and run.

Boston, though, won't have it. While they sip their beer back at their usual hangout, he lambastes Tsotsi for his lack of conscience. Doesn't he have any respect, Boston asks. Tsotsi's response: to beat Boston's face to a pulp and run out alone in the rain. There, while fleeing from Soweto into the main town, Tsotsi experiences the first of many flashbacks. In this one, he remembers fleeing as a child along the same path, also in the rain, towards a large stack of abandoned water main pipes piled outside Soweto. As he approaches, he sees today's street kids, living on their own in the same way he once did. Only later do we learn the details of his flight from home.

With the first remembrance of his early life Tsotsi begins to move towards conscience; but it takes his shooting a young woman, Pumla Dube (Nambitha Mpumlwana), as she returns home with her groceries and waits at her driveway entrance for her husband to open their gate, to push his transition into high gear. Tsotsi steals her car to get away, leaving her to die in the street, and several miles out of town, is shocked to hear the woman's infant son crying in the back seat. Tsotsi skids to a crash halt, packs up the groceries, unfastens the baby's car seat restraints, puts him in the grocery bag and heads home.

Suddenly, he has responsibility. And suddenly, he remembers the comfort of his mother's love. He remembers her illness, his father's angry control over her and him, his life when he was called David, and the pain of having to choose between loosing his mother and staying with a father so brutal that he broke the spine of David's dog's with one kick.

Of course, Tsotsi arrives at accepting responsibility for what he has done, along with whatever punishment he has coming, only after twisting and turning along a ragged journey that first brings him to apologize to his friend Boston, to Miriam (Terry Pheto), the woman he coerced into breast feeding the child, to a crippled old man he had abused, and ultimately to the people he hurt most.

This process gratifies viewers with a sense of Tsotsi's moral triumph, against all odds. But that does not come without tragedy---true tragedy, the result of poor human choices, and the pain of Tsotsi and his victims. Moreover, for all his welcomed remorse, Tsotsi is hardly exonerated. The film embraces ethics, and encourages personal responsibility. A winner, despite the tragic losses portrayed.

2560531,3,B000FC2FX8,"I read Athol Fugard's book on which this award-winning film was based, and it floored me--violence, survival, redemption and fate carried weight in the harrowing story of Tsotsi, the boy street criminal without a name (other than ""thug"", which ""Tsotsi"" means in the native argot).  The movie started similarly, as Tsotsi and his gang commit one unforgettable act of violence, and Tsotsi alienates his gang with another.  From here the movie strayed from its source, to its detriment in my opinion.  Tsotsi becomes responsible for an infant--a responsibility that changes him--hence the redemptive part.  But redemption pushes all the way to the end, muscling out fate--perhaps the filmmakers felt that Fugard's ending just wouldn't stand with moviegoers used to at least some semblance of a happy ending.  In my view they went way too far in this regard, and emasculated the story of much of its power.  Had I not read the book, I might have rated the film a star higher, but knowing what I know about the book, ""Tsotsi"" the film barely rates 3 stars, mostly for the performances of its young cast.

Although much has been seen before, since the conditions of poverty remain universal, TSOTSI reveals a world few of us know in the West.  To see an African perspective, understand the African class system, and see the social conditions resulting from such overwhelming poverty in the African setting is revelatory.

Though the setting is in South Africa, the issues in the film resonate with what is happening in the Southern African region. Tsotsi also shows that there is also compassion in people who commit crime and these people are ready to redeem themselves and start life afresh. Tsotsi also debunks the myth that all is well for the ordinary man in the street in post-apartheid South Africa by depicting the harsh reality in African townships like Soweto. The 'rainbow nation' image of South Africa is revisited (though in a subtle way)and shows the disparaties of those who live in the poor urban areas and those in the affluent surburbs.

2560548,5,B000FC2FX8,"'Tsotsi' is a great story--not only because of the universality of love gone wrong and the experience of jaundiced youth, but it is also a nice update to post-apartheid Johanesberg, South Africa.  The title character is a tense and tough member of a group of criminals who hangs out at a local bar and goes to rich neighborhoods to rob vulnerable mansions under the protection of iron gates.  Tsotsi is quiet with an undercurrent of raw violence that is ready to erupt at the drop of a hat.  At one point, he pummels in a friend's face after having a disagreement at the bar.

One day he and a friend rob a wealthy man's house, and he is caught by the wife whom Tsotsi shoots and steals her car.  He flees without his friend, only to find her baby in the back seat of the car.  Gentle as a presence but complicating his life, the baby brings feelings of tenderness to the surface, so he uses his gangster methods to force a neighbor to take care of the infant.  The experience also elicits his own memories that show his own vulnerablity, and so by taking care of the baby, in some ways he recognizes his own needs.

'Tsotsi' is by all means an absorbing movie with tense and believable performances all around.  While it goes to the heart of every urban culture, the update of post-Mandela South Africa shows that, even when social justice is presented, some needs go unmet and bubbling below the surface.",1165795200,,1406,4.482352941176471

2560551,4,B000FC2FX8,"""Tsotsi"" is a powerful, Oscar-winning foreign-language movie from South Africa that could make expat South Africans feel good for all the wrong reasons. Based on the 1960 Athol Fugard novel, it is a tough, unflinching story Directed by Gavin Hood that speaks with the authentic voice of the township, beautifully shot and directed while showcasing a stunning performance by Presley Chweneyagae..

This movie is easily comparable to the Brazilian favela gang movie, City of God but is a much more personal story that turns on an eerily sensitive portrayal by Presley. Everyone speaks in tsoti-taal, so be prepared to read subtitles and catch a few words in English and Afrikaans which sounds like guttural English and a melange of tribal languages. The music track will also bring you up to date with the new rap music of South Africa, kwaito which you might find a little more interesting than the us gangsta variety.

""Tsotsi"" won't sell too many tourist seats on South African Airways and it will be perversely appreciated by expats for reminding them how safe and sound they feel in America. Likewise, their friends and relatives back home will come away advised to find better remotes, quicker-acting electronic gates and motion detectors. For the most part, if it makes South Africa seem attractive, it will be for those who enjoy the thrill of peering into a Darwinian World from the safety of a tourist bus....or a movie theater.

Nevertheless, it is a world class movie that will get 2 thumbs up from Ebert and Roper and have a respectable run in art houses, probably winding up on HBO. It won't attract the same crowd that watches Boyz in the Hood or other gangsta flicks because it is too introspective and turns on the kidnapping of a baby without hope of ransom, something 30 year old males will have a hard time making sense of. But it is still gripping in a way that gets at the heart of South Africa's children of the street, their free-floating threat and their ultimate cost to society.

The most compelling thing for ex-pats, and for that matter, the kind of refined audience that will actually go to this movie is both the viciousness and vulnerability of the lead tsotsi. It is truly frightening because you feel you can reach out to him but at the same time it could also cost you a bullet or thin knife to the heart. No wonder a green card feels so good........!

Yet the movie stands as a kind of cleverly crafted wake up call to help because the lost people seem capable of a rude redemption: the tsotsi saves a life....but only by taking another. Or that he does a good deed but only after crippling an innocent person.

Interestingly, according to the star, Presley, this movie played to sold out crowds in the townships, where kids often remarked ""hey, that's like me."" You'd kind of wish they didn't feel that way which begs the exit question, what can we do about these abandoned kids will come back to plague us.......?

It is interesting how this 1960 period story was updated to the new reality. AIDS awareness signs are everywhere and instead of it being about black-on-black township crime, the black victims are well-to-do suburbanites in a security obsessed upscale neighborhood, driving BMW's & Mercedes. The only white performer is a hardened detective who speaks perfect tsotsi-taal and blends seamlessly with new black majority South Africa. He is there to remind you that it is not just ""their problem.""

The acting is so good all around that if you just see it for its technical achievement you'll go away proud. If you see it for its overall story, you might think twice about taking the family back but at least you'll get a bracing update on what South Africa is, and feel proud that no one splattered it with whitewash.",1160870400,6,3765,4.737404580152671

Tsotsi (""Thug"") is a story about the redemptive power of innocence (a child's innocence). When Tsotsi finds the baby he begins the journey of finding David - his given name. Even the members of his gang don't know his ""real"" name or - it seems - his story.

I was, personally, disturbed by my affinity for Tsotsi. He had just brutally beaten one of his ""friends"" yet I felt for him. Presley Chweneyagae's portrayal of Tsotsi  made me wonder what could have happened in Tsosti's life to make him fear his own humanity. Through flashbacks you are given glimpses to what happened.

Presley Chweneyagae's physical transformation is heart wrenching. You see no life in his eyes when the film begins. When he stalks a cripple man all night (he is so focused he misses his appointment with his friends) you cringe at his predatory vengeful nature; yet he goes home and tenderly removes ants from a baby - that he keeps in a paper bag under his bed. The dichotomy is brilliant. By the end you feel and see the transformation. His tears are cleansing Tsotsi and re-birthing David.

2560555,5,B000FC2FX8,"It's so great to finally see a major feature film that shows Africa from an African perspective, as opposed to through the prism of Western eyes. Another recent well-deserved Oscar winner (Best foreign language film) I just had to have in my collection; this is a violent and uncompromising look at life in a Soweto township.

Presley Cheweneyagae plays the lead, a Johannesburg small-time gangster whose nickname Tsotsi means ""thug"". I read somewhere that Presley was discovered playing Hamlet in a Soweto theatre group. He's a find in a million, as his performance is mesmerising.

Tsotsi finds a baby in the back of a car he's just jacked off a suburban black woman as the woman waited for the security gates outside her home to open. He doesn't do the expected and simply dump the baby at the side of the road - surprisingly, he decides to take it home and care for it. He hasn't a clue how to care for a child of course and he turns to a local woman who makes decorative mobiles from glass. She's a nursing mother herself, and - under the threat of death, mind you - Tsotsi gets her to look after the child while he goes back out there to do his thing.

It's an interesting study of how complex life is for people who don't have much and while the movie doesn't make excuses or descend into sentimentality at any point, it's engaging to gradually see the heart of the man called Tsotsi - a man who at first glance seemed utterly heartless - emerge for all to see. It's a great story, based on the novel by South African playwright Athol Fugard, and the final scenes had me (literally) on the edge of my seat the first time I watched it. Gavin Hood makes good use of Johannesburg's urban setting and the natural beauty of South Africa. I strongly recommend this movie.

The miracle of a transformation that was led onto smooth tracks by a man who could have died in the presidential office and decided to retire in full possession of his consciousness and with quite a few years ahead for him to enjoy the brand new liberty he has enabled his country to finally discover. It is a parabole of this transformation that has to take place in the soul of every single citizen, one after the other, and all in the solitude of meditation and reflection. This happens with Tsotsi on the day when the crying of a baby reminds him of the time when he was brutalized by his own father. This crying meant his past of alienation and victimization could be cauterized and bought back to become a beacon on the road to salvation. Just let your heart speak and do something good to repair the evil you may have done or the evil one may have done to you. The hungry tears of a baby can open up the sky of a soul to reveal all the stars and the moon that are shining up there waiting for you to capture their brilliance and turn it into the energy you need to turn the page, to finally discover the value of love, the love of a baby, your love for the baby, and the deepest ever desire to transform the world by transforming yourself because history is done in the mental melting pot of our individual spiritualities and minds. Then and only then can David stand up in front of Goliath. An optimistic film among so many that are not and it all dances on the edge of a sharp blade that could turn better into worse and a miraculous epiphany into a bloody mess.

However, this film is different.  It shows the ""bad guy"" transform from an early point and the film is that journey.  The director and actors do an outstanding job at pulling this off and the ending sequence is a great example.  It's very powerful and involves very little dialogue, but relies mostly on good acting and great cinematography.

I agree with the one review that said we don't empathize with his victims enough, but I think the Tsotsi's actions toward the end are his penance.  Just the fact that a villain reaches this point of empathy is something and it wasn't done cheaply, it was done over the course of the film and you feel it's legitimate.  Of course it may have felt more so if we had focused further on the mother's suffering, this is a good point well taken.

How about the woman who is paralyzed from Tsotsi's gunfire?  or the honest, dignified businessman who is horrifically knifed for the little money in his wallet?  and the aspiring teacher who is brutally beaten and disfigured by Tsotsi?  The film does not dwell on their fates -- just Tsotsi's.
While viewers can be struck by the hopeful note of the possibility of this brutal criminal discovering his own humanity, redemption isn't that simple.  The underlying themes are troubling: it isn't his fault -- his childhood, abusive father, victimized mother, lack of education, etc. may have helped create this monster -- but he IS a monster.  One can be seduced into a feel-good experience by focusing on his emerging empathy and personal growth, but only because the film ignores his victims and the ongoing impact of Tsotsi's actions.
If you want a feel-good, hopeful movie -- it's very good.  But be prepared to be unsettled if you aren't comfortable with shades of gray, and a limited examination of the issues of urban violence.",1156291200,20,1217,5.024875621890548

I quite liked the lead actor's character, not that I agree with his way of thinking. This movie is unpredictable and has it's own pace. A lot of people say this movie is better than Crash. Please slap them for me. My favourite scene in this film involves a crippled beggar who tells Tsotsi why he wants to live in this world. His answer just might determine his life.

2560563,5,B000FC2FX8,"TSOTSI is a jewel of a film, well deserving the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 2005.  Though set in Johannesburg, South Africa, the story is unfortunately so universal that the film could have been made in any country in the world: the lost children of abusive parents who survive life by relying on crime fill the streets of the poor neighborhoods of all major cities.  TSOTSI is a tragedy but it carries a sense of hope and redemption that makes it a powerful statement indeed.

Tsotsi - translated, means 'Thug'- (Presley Chweneyagae) is an amoral youth who heads a gang of four: Boston (Mothusi Magano), Aap (Kenneth Nkosi), and Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe). The gang steals and in general leads a life of dangerous existence, a life that abruptly alters when the gang robs and kills a gentle older man on the subway. They are on the run now and Tsotsi isolates himself further when he brutally beats Boston.  He descends further into the abyss when he steals a car in the wealthy neighborhood, shooting the woman driving, and then discovering that in the back seat is an infant.  His childhood flashes before his eyes and he finally shows a degree if buried decency when he takes the child with him as he abandons the stolen vehicle.  Young and inexperienced in child care (his own childhood was riddled with hate and abuse), he seeks help from a young woman Miriam (Terry Pheto) who has an infant of her own (with no father) and serves as a wet nurse for the child.  The manner in which Tsotsi gradually reconciles his bad life with his nascent response to recognizing kindness and salvation advances the story to its conclusion.

There is far more to the story than this short synopsis would indicate: there are levels of probing into the mind of the youthful criminal and the making of a gangster and the interaction among thieves and the changes that situations can alter that are beautifully written by Director Gavin Hood based on the Athol Fugard novel. The script is terse and much is left to the physical expressions of the characters, each acted to perfection by a stunning cast.  The outsider living situation of these people is filmed with tremendous atmosphere and creativity by cinematographer Lance Gewer and the musical score by Paul Hepker and Mark Kilian serves to support the mood and action well.  This is a tough movie to watch because of the reality of the issues: this is a superlative film to experience for the message it offers and for the wholly unforgettable acting of young Presley Chweneyagae and Terry Pheto. In Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans with English subtitles. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, August 06",1154649600,8,2642,4.774122807017544
2560564,3,B000FC2FX8,"It's almost unfortunate that this 2005 South African film was made after Fernando Meirelles' brutalizing 2003 ""City of God"" as the latter film really sets the cinematic standard for portraying harsh urban nihilism onscreen. Instead of Rio's favelas, we now have the Soweto shantytowns as the geographic focal point. And instead of the unrelenting visceral intensity of the Brazilian film, director-writer Gavin Hood presents a story that begins with a fearsome veracity but unfortunately settles for a more conventional sense of plot structure and character development.

Based on a 1960 novel by Athol Fugard, the story concerns the title character, a teenage ruffian who heads up a gang of four in post-apartheid South Africa. A robbery-turned-stabbing in a subway triggers a lot of unwanted questions for Tsotsi about his past among his fellow gang members. He almost kills his best friend Boston before running away and finding a carjacking opportunity. Violence yet again erupts in this episode, but the surprise is that he finds a baby in the backseat of the car he stole. From that point, the baby becomes a catalyst for Tsotsi's humanistic character transformation, including an initially tense relationship with Miriam, a young widow and mother whom he seeks out to feed the baby.

For a film that starts out with such unblinking grittiness, it is surprising and a bit sad to see it evolve into an increasingly sentimental journey even with the jagged edge of violence present throughout. Some scenes, especially toward the last half-hour including an unnecessary flashback, come across as particularly mawkish, even though the ending does generate genuine tension. In his film debut, Presley Chweneyagae is impressive as Tsotsi, even when the script calls for his character to go through some awfully quick changes in short order. Terry Pheto is certainly a becalming presence as Miriam, though it is unclear to me whether the young woman has the welfare of Tsotsi or the baby as her priority. The other gang members are portrayed with acuity - Mothusi Magano as the cerebral Boston, Kenneth Nkosi as the befuddled follower Aap, and Zenzo Ngqobe as the aptly named Butcher.

The one aspect that deserves unequivocal praise is Lance Brewer's stunning cinematography which captures the burnished landscape of the shantytowns in vibrant detail. There are several extras with the 2006 DVD that are worth checking out, beginning with Hood's informative commentary and an intriguing 1998 short he made called ""The Storekeeper"". There are several deleted scenes included, but the most interesting are two variations on the final minutes of the film (Hood chose correctly in my opinion). A lively music video of the movie's propulsive opening song, ""Mdlwembe"" by Zola, is also included. It's necessary to use the English subtitle option since the characters are speaking a local dialect called Tsotsi-Taal.",1154476800,4,2908,5.2494623655913975

8120599,5,B000FC2FX8,"Que Pasa? That is Spanish for whats up and while it is entirely possible for a reader to understand what I was saying, there are probably far more who wont. Films are widely praised as the definitive art form because they combine visuals, sound, acting, and many other features to create the ultimate experience, but unfortunately, not all films are spoken in our native tongue. Many people refuse to see a film if they have to use subtitles to understand it and while that is completely understandable, Tsotsi is a film I would recommend to any film lover.

 The basic story of this movie is that Tsotsi, the protagonist of the film and a gang leader, makes a mistake that he regrets almost immediately after he does it. After stealing a car (while crippling a woman in the process, no less), he realizes that there is a baby in the backseat. Woops! While the film establishes early on that Tsotsi is not a saint, stealing a baby was not his intention. The rest of the film might seem obvious, as it is rather predictable, but that is just the skin of this excellent movie. You could say (which I will) that the baby serves as a catalyst for the rest of the movie and is really just what propels the plot, but I mean that in a good way. Although Tsotsi is a gang leader who steals for a living, he is not a simple cardboard cutout; he is a complex character with a tragic backstory, which I think is the absolute highlight of the film. A specific scene that I loved occurred roughly halfway through the film and is a flashback about his family (which he briefly mentioned before). The scene is phenomenal and well executed (and very sad), but even without that scene (which there are a few of), you could still sense that he had a troubled childhood. Earlier in the film, near the beginning, someone mentions his parents and he completely loses it on that person, beating him to a pulp. Scenes like those are what make the film because they show what a complex character Tsotsi is, despite his exterior of a tough bad boy; Presley Chweneyagae, the actor who plays him, does a great job with facial expressions, especially his menacing stare. It is difficult to describe the character arc that the movie shows without spoilers and although it is somewhat obvious where it is going, it is so well done that I loved it.

 Aside from the story, the other major part of the film that stuck out to me was the music, which I loved half of and hated the other half of. Tsotsi roughly translates to thug and the movie has a lot of rap music, which many people (including myself) associate with thugs. This fits his character, but I just hate that style of music, so it didn't really do it for me. So, I hated it subjectively, but I thought that it fit objectively. The other half of the music is amazing and creates a somber tone that I think fits with the film (the end credits, specifically, are a treat for the ears).

 Is the movie worth seeing? Absolutely! While any movie can be nitpicked, this is one of the few movies that I have watched that didn't have any glaring flaws on my first viewing. It is not perfect, but it is so well done that I was totally immersed. Tsotsi is a remarkable character played by a remarkable actor and it is definitely a film that I would watch again.

8120601,5,B000FC2FX8,"Used in the street language called 'Tsotsi,' this movie brings to screen the disparity between well to do and downright poor individuals, and what it pushes them to do an become. It also is a challenge to post-apartheid South Africa to look at the poor in their own way, using their own language as a means to convey their life to others.

The movie has high ratings on some other web sites so I guess my wife and I are in the minority on this, but we both thought it was terrible.  I'm not sure what people like about this movie.  The plot is ridiculous.  You don't like any of there characters because everything they do is stupid.  It is disturbing on many occasions.  There is nothing good about this movie.

If a comedy movie is really bad, it gets ridiculed.  Somehow, if you make a drama like this and package it correctly, it has artistic value and the critics love it.

I see no reason to watch this movie.",1479254400,,670,4.21259842519685
