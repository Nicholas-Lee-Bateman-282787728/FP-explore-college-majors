What if fate tied you to someone?  What if fate also was playing tricks on you?  A young man with a heart condition loves a girl.  That girl deeply loves him.  As childhood friends, they grow up together.  They are always together.  There are so many twists that could be spoiled by telling more.  Suffice it to say that the ending is perfect.  It is a story of life and love that competes with Shakespeare in its twists.

If you like plot driven movies, you will find this one slow.  If you like character driven movies, you will regret not owning this one if you do not get it.",1358208000,2,827,4.258064516129032

It's very funny, it's very sweet without being too saccharine, and its pathos is equal to movies like TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. Now, I will say there were some things they did that left me a little puzzled, but maybe that's just because I'm an American and am still a bit of a virgin when it comes to Japanese culture. But it's so far one of the best love stories to come out of any country that I've ever seen. I recommend reading the manga as well. You can find it online.

The movie begins with a voiceover: ""My love life has a time limit."" Takuma and Mayu fall in love when they are eight years old. Takuma has heart disease and Mayu's father is his cardiologist. After he learns that he will die at the age of 20, Takuma and Mayu make a vow to marry at the age of 20. As they get older, Takuma tries to distance himself from Mayu for fear of hurting her. But she holds steadfast in the hopes of being with him.

This movie will probably appeal more to young adults than it will older adults, although one critic who said that did admit that he was moved to tears. Readers of the manga will find the filmmakers' conclusion either unfavorable or the right thing to do. Either way, it's still a better love story than TWILIGHT.",1352332800,,1293,4.252032520325203
