3826216,5,B001WAVVGY,"The only reason this gets 5 stars is because I love Edward Lee (who is one of the cops by the way, the other cop being Jack Ketchum). The book was great, but the movie was just ok.",1248307200,2,180,3.763157894736842
3826217,4,B001WAVVGY,"This one Kinda threw me. It was not quite what I thought it would be.  I think it is a sexual/horror film where the sex is done on dead  peoples heads. Any way I guess it did tell a story, in its own gross way. To each its own.",1247788800,2,227,3.6122448979591835
3826218,5,B001WAVVGY,"This movie rocked. It's EXACTLY like the book. Low budget, hardcore and horrific. IT'S NOT the typical crap slasher horror or torture horror the kids are accustomed to these days. Instead this pays tribute to the grindhouse horror flicks I grew up on. Header is now one of my favorites. Just wait.  this thing is going to be a classic someday. I totally recommend buying this movie if you're into seeing some twisted sexual violence sprinkled throughout one hell of a plot line. It's like Deliverance meets CSI. It's like an unrated Russ Meyer's movie but instead of breasts, you get Headers. This is what Midnight movies were all about. Thank God someone had the balls to make the best Edward Lee story into a movie. So many adaptations suck, but this one stayed true to the source.

Highly recommended.",1247702400,6,804,4.735714285714286
3826219,5,B001WAVVGY,"Forget the horror films your friends like--they're pussies

Check this out, if you're man enough

This film is wildly disturbing and controversial, sick and intense--In fact, you'll probably need to get out your bedpans and nightlights--its going to be hard to sleep again...",1247616000,3,275,5.372093023255814
3826220,5,B001WAVVGY,This film is one of the most twisted and horrifying thrillers I've ever seen.  It's like nothing else and utterly magnificent.,1247529600,5,126,5.0
3826221,5,B001WAVVGY,"Edward Lee has long been my favorite author and this movie proves why! King is a puss comparatively! no one had the balls to even touch this movie and i know the punks will come out of the woodworks to challenge me i don't care you will all be taken to task by me! this is the most true to source film i have seen in a very long time! Everyone involved with this film deserves NOTHING but respect! It is obviously a labor of love for all involved and from the sound design to the actors to the gore it is TOP NOTCH! This is not for everyone nor should it be. If you don't like gore if you don't like objectionable/offensive subject matter this will not be for you. Leave now. For those of you who are still reading if you love and are familliar with the small press work of ED LEE this is what you(and I) have been waiting for! I will not give away the story i will say that i am not disappointed at all! All of my expectations were met and exceeded! Rob Zombie wishes he could do this, but he cant and never will! Fulci would be proud! If you don't know who FULCI is do some research and learn what real HORROR is you aren't ready for this! I would simply offer my thanks and utmost respect to all involved! I SAY THANK YOU FOR SHOWING PEOPLE HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE!!!!!!!!!!",1247529600,11,1275,4.083665338645418
3826232,1,B001WAVVGY,It was a stupid B movie with a horrible plot and really bad acting. The story is disturbing but all around the movie was really bad.,1336953600,,132,4.115384615384615
3826233,1,B001WAVVGY,"Horrible. Words cannot describe how badly this film was made. I am usually pretty lenient with horror films, but this was beyond disgusting. The acting was very bad, some of the dialogue and plot made no sense. Finding out the act of ""heading"" actually was disturbed me. Worst horror film ever seen so far.",1325980800,3,306,4.685185185185185
3826234,4,B001WAVVGY,"What is a Header?  Well, it ain't no soccer move.

Synapse Films proudly presents Header, a 2009 horror story adapted from Edward Lee's novella.  I don't doubt Lee first thought of the most messed up, repugnant, nasty, filthy, deranged, psychotic, disturbing act and then built the story around it.

This is a warped tale about Travis, an ex-con and his creepy, perverted grandpappy.  The old man convinces his grandson to entertain him by performing a gruesome Header on some hapless victims.  Good family fun.

Their paths are about to collide with Stewart, a shady ATF Special Agent that has became immersed in a seedy narcotics ring.  All lines of moral decency are about to be violated in the most heinous fashion.

Nothing to brilliant or incredibly clever here, but sheesh!  Sick stuff.  The acting isn't particularly great, but the special effects will register quite a jolt.  Worth a look for any cinematic fan of gore, nudity, and unspeakable atrocities.",1290384000,,964,4.9937106918239
3826235,5,B001WAVVGY,Man what can I say.....I LOVE horror films mostly b movies this film takes the cake on sico type horror!!! It is a great film but you are let sitting there saying wtf and why did I watch this lol...Buy this movie you will love it!!!,1279411200,2,232,4.065217391304348
3826236,1,B001WAVVGY,"Horror fans.  Trust me. This is the worst I've seen in a while.  Acting is at a Grade School level.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, the goal of this failure is to answer the question, What is a header?  I have to agree.  After about 30 minutes I could take no more and ejected it. I'm truly mystified how any viewer could have given this a positive review. I can only guess they were somehow moved by the concept of a ""Header"".  Again, Trust me.  This is a very poor quality experience.",1266624000,4,489,4.25
3826237,4,B001WAVVGY,"After seeing a horror flick like this, I now know that this will be brought up time and time again when talking about a messed-up film.  I've seen many horror flicks way more gorier than this one, but the story that this flick is about rates up there high on the SICK-O-METER!!!  On some parts in this film, I felt like I was committing a crime simply because I was watching it haha.  What else is next?....seriously!  I can definitely see this become a cult classic.  I know folks throw those two words around a lot, but I mean it!  With what this story is about, the amount of gore depicted in this flick, matches evenly.  Even a gorehound like me knows when to be smart on how much gore needs to be thrown around.  It all depends on what the story is about.  'Header', in my opinion, is definitely a video nasty!",1260230400,10,815,4.2745098039215685
3826238,2,B001WAVVGY,"Read a lot of hype about this movie.  Kudos, to all the reviewers that kept a Header a secret although it doesn't take much a imagination to know what it is.

I followed Edward Lee through the Splatterpunk days and his stories were a notch twisted more than the rest.  I do encourage any gorehound and those with a taste of the macabre to go read his books\stories.  You can create imagines for more dark in your head than this movie could ever portray using Lee's words alone.

If you saw Martyr's, Inside, Frontiers or even Ichi then you can forget to be disturbed by this film.  Even more mainstream films like the TCM remake is far more brutal.  For those wanting to grab this because of Jack Ketchum's name on it and are expecting a Girl Next Door type of quality.........forget it.

The movie isn't bad for what it is.  A low budget red neck film.  The acting is above average, the script is quite good and the editing and camera work are fluid and crisp.  The plot moved at a good pace and there was a great build up and end to the movie.

But if you want gore and disturbing, this lost its edge real quick.  Perhaps I am too jaded.......but after the 3rd header it's just not shocking (wasnt the first time either) anymore and got a little boring.",1250467200,5,1255,4.334763948497854
3826239,5,B001WAVVGY,"Great movie. Grandpappy is hilarious, a great horror character.

I didn't find it especially gory, but the subject matter is indeed sick. Just a great horror/black comedy.",1250380800,5,171,5.333333333333333
3826240,1,B001WAVVGY,"This movie only exists to serve as the feeble punchline to the unfunny joke, ""What's a header?""  Even after the dim ATF hero has seen two women's bodies with holes drilled into their brains and semen dripping out, he's still desperately trying to find someone who can explain to him what a ""header"" is. Unfortunately, we in the audience find out long before he does - which is typical of this movie, in which there is NO suspense.  No terror either - we don't care about any of the anonymous victims who get ""headered"", so the indignities visited on their bodies are just gross/disgusting, not frightening.  The writing - and the delivery of the terrible writing by the decent actors - is a mess.  Many scenes of this movie are so dimly lit that you can barely make out what's happening (nor would you care, if you could.) If you get off on dead-baby jokes, you might find this movie fitfully amusing - otherwise, steer clear.",1248825600,8,926,4.5602409638554215
3826241,4,B001WAVVGY,"Ah, I can't tell you what a header is, because if you're interested in this film, you'll have to see yourself.  But when you find out, guaranteed you will be repulsed, BIG time.  If not, then please seek help.

We have a Alcohol, Tobacco, & Firearms agent who is working both sides of the law because his wife is sick & her prescriptions cost WAY too much.  So of course, because he loves her, Agent Cummings does what he has to do to get by.

We have a man who just got out of jail, & heads on back to live with his legless grandpappy, who makes shoes, and there he finds out what a header is.  The most I can tell you is it's ""The worst thing someone can do to somebody"".  At least that's how grandpappy describes it.  It's a form of revenge, although how it was determined to be a viable revenge method is beyond me.

Of course, as the films goes on, folks begin to cross paths & greed kicks in and there's lots of header action going on too, so things get rather ugly & there's an ending that's completely unexpected.  Kind of ""when in Rome, do as the Romans"".  Ick.

Reminds me a bit of 70's flicks, maybe grindhouse type stuff, with lots of hillbillies & gore & uh, well, sex, I guess you could say, so if you enjoy this type of stuff then you'll probably like it.  Probably not recommended for fans of the mainstream, though.  4 out of 5.",1248307200,19,1345,4.162790697674419
8347433,4,B001WAVVGY,very cool new twist on horror. i enjoyed this film,1471824000,,50,4.1
8347434,5,B001WAVVGY,One of the most disturbing horror films ever made. I'd love to read the books from Mr. Lee,1443225600,,90,4.055555555555555
8347435,5,B001WAVVGY,Ok I going to start off my reviews like all the others I am in no way any kind of movie critic I love watching movies and to read some of these reviews I am totally amazed on the detail etc etc well don't expect that here or on any of my other reviews ok that been said and out of the way I thought the movie was good you're have to be a fan of Edward lee his book was gross and disgusting so is this movie,1427414400,,406,3.625
8347436,5,B001WAVVGY,"This is one hell of a movie! Fantastic, horrific! I live in the UK, and this film would be banned! Yes we still live in the 18th century!",1424390400,2,137,3.9285714285714284
8347437,5,B001WAVVGY,"As a long-time lover and collector of Indie and foreign horror films, I thought I'd seen it all. Delightfully, I was wrong! This movie starts with a hard punch to your sensibilities and then never let's up until the jaw-dropping, eye-bugging end.
Creepy, horrific, disgusting and totally disturbed-everything a horror movie should be!
Well acted, beautifully shot, and with a haunting music score-you'll never forget Header!!!",1415318400,2,426,5.46969696969697
8347438,5,B001WAVVGY,Just as horrifying as expected,1411603200,,30,5.2
8347439,3,B001WAVVGY,"WARNING!  SPOILER ALERT!  Despite the horrific premise of the ""header"", this is a halfway-decent crime-drama, featuring a DEA agent who is slowly descending into madness!  In trying to support his girlfriend's medical needs, the agent works both sides of the law, ever-looking for the big score.  The ""header"" kills are really only a sideline of the main story, whereby the DEA agent develops an interest in trying to find the killer, ultimately becoming one himself.  The ""header"" is graphically portrayed in this film; in essence, one cuts a large hole in top of victim's head, a vertical opening is sliced in the brain with a knife, and then sexual penetration takes place.  Not one for the kids or a date night; still, it is worth a quick watch for those of us who just have to see what all the fuss is about!",1403136000,,813,4.65034965034965

8347441,5,B001WAVVGY,"Set in the backwoods, this tale of extreme violence follows an ATF agent on the take. Watch it and find out what a header is!
The acting is sub par, and this is a low budget movie, but is has a certain charm, I really enjoyed it.",1394496000,,229,3.893617021276596
8347442,5,B001WAVVGY,"I knew what I was getting into with this movie, being a long time Edward Lee fan.  It was like stepping into the book itself, and I understand the authors glee with his vision coming to life.  Some scenes made me cringe and giggle at the same time.  If you like shocking/twisted/gory movies and books, give this movie (and your stomach) a chance.",1366588800,,346,4.4603174603174605
