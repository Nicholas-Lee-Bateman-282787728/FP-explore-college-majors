8744689,5,B019CXSX7W,"As far as i know this was only a 12 episode series and that is what is on the version I have which may not be this one. It is a good fantasy adventure  mixed with  harem romcom theme with a little added Fan service.. I'll admit my version is a little censored (TV Version) but as far as I can see it is not significantly (if at all) cut. Most of these versions are probably pirated versions (though sometimes just which is uncertain) though as I have not seen a domestic release this is the best you will do unless you get the original Japanese BluRay version which should play on US players though I am uncertain as to whether this has English Subtitles. Overall this is a fun enjoyable series and one which I have already watched several times and if you like a fantasy based story mixed with humour and romance this is worth checking out. For the record my copy is released by Hong Feng Entertainment and has 12 episodes on one disc with subtitles in English, Chinese and Malay.",1468022400,,981,4.326086956521739
