1420160,4,B00005B222,"The 'Voyage of the Unicorn' is the story of the Aisling family - Professor Alan Aisling and his two daughters - the skeptical, bad-tempered Miranda and the dreamy, absent-minded Cassie. The girls weren't always like this though - they were once happy, sweet-natured girls - till their mother dies that is. Now the family live separate lives though they live in the same house - Alan who devotes his time to preaching his 'cresendo vides' (in believing one sees) philosophy at the university, which does not go down well with the Dean; Cassie who looses herself for days in her mother's portfolio and artwork, neglecting school, food and the real world in general; and Miranda, who has lost most of her faith in the human race and leds an unhappy, discontented life. All this is about to change however, when their home is attacked one night by a violent group of trolls, who are out to stop a prophesy concerning the Aisling family from coming true. While Miranda and Mr Aisling attempt to ward them off, Cassie is whisked off by an elf - Sebastian, and a dwarf - Malachi, down to the docks where their ship, The Unicorn waits. Followed closely by Miranda and Professor Aisling, all of them are spirited away to the Landscape of the Imagination on board the magical, beautiful ship which has been specially prepared for them.
It is there that they discover their destiny from King Oberon and Queen Titania on the Isle of Faerie - it has been prophesied that 'a man of learning, and two maidens gentle of spirit' will enter the realm to free the land of the evil scourge of trolls by finding and summoning the great dragon - and at the same time freeing heroes of old.
And so they're off on their journey - with Malachi and Sebastian, who is smitten with Miranda, and on the way they have run-ins with legendary creatures such as a sea serpent, trolls, mermaids, fairies, Medusa, the Sphinx, the Minotaur, ogres, unicorns and more. It is this voyage that the movie excells in - great costumes, set design, special effects, a beautiful soundtrack that includes the song - 'Faith precedes a Miracle', and good acting and story telling. Watch out for my favourite scenes - when Miranda subdues the sea serpent, when Cassie tames the unicorn and when Titania gives each member of the family special gifts, and special advice that only they can hear.
This is a very good movie - it's interesting, bright, colourful, well directed and acted throughout. Traditional creatures such as fairies are given a whole new look and it's a great family movie to all watch together. If you love fantasy and adventure then this movies for you.
However, one fault is that it ended rather abruptedly, and with far too many unanswered questions and loose ends. I wonder if perhaps I watched a cut version of this movie, as when I watched 'The Making of the Voyage of the Unicorn' there was a scene being filmed that featured the Sphinx in the interior of the ship which was definitly not on the movie I watched. I picked up on inconsistencies that - although they don't totally destroy viewing-pleasure - nag in your mind as though you've missed out on something. And cutting bits out of this movie which is about the individual's internal voyage as much as the physical journey is not doing it justice. My queries include -
How did they get home? - they all just seemed to wake up the next day with no real recollections of the entire voyage!
What happened to the Sphinx? - she saves Cassie and then disappears.
Was Lily (the girls' mother) really a 'spiritual guide'? How did she know about the Unicorn and the Landscape of Imagination?
What happened to the disgraced Oberon?
Did Sebastian and Miranda really get together?
Why did Professor Aisling pick up all those rocks from the different islands? - it looked like it would be an evolving story line but nothing came of it.
Too many unanswered questions!!!",1016496000,22,3888,4.669096209912537
1420161,5,B00005B222,"I first saw this mini-series on Odyssey last Saturday, and I loved it! It is a truly imaginative story about Cassie Aisling, a young girl who is swept away with her father and her sister Miranda on a magical adventure aboard the ship the Unicorn.  The ship's motto is ""Credendo Vides"", meaning ""by believing, one sees."" The family realizes that the trolls have been ravaging the Faerie islands, hoping to take them over for themselves. The Aislings' only hope is a magical dragon skull, which the trolls want for themselves.  This story is about believing the unbelievable, and keeping your imagination alive.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs an adventure, or just a few hours away from reality.",984960000,8,704,4.85

The acting has all the enthusiasm of toddlers being paid in sugar-free candy to act in an after-school special. The SFX makeup is about on the level of Hercules VS. The Moon Men. For a similar experience you could stab yourself in the eyes with tweezers and snort the early 2000s. The plot is about as strong and enduring as single-ply toilet paper. I'm not sure who the main character is. I was literally bribed into watching this movie, and I hesitate to even call it a movie. I don't know what they're trying to do and I'm not even sure what the antagonist's name is (I think it's either Scooter or Scrotum) and the dialogue is a mess.

The story plot is real good but I could have done without the comedy...I was expecting more serious scenes which leave the viewer at the edge of the seat wanting more. The acting was also good for the most part except from some of the acting which was very what I call ""artificial"". More special effects and magic could have also helped.

This is a movie for people who don't mind indulging in childhood fantasy and can really just let themselves go and enter into this movie's world and ideas, where belief and will are more powerful than anything else.  I especially liked their re-imagining of Medusa as a kind of tragic heroine instead of a mindless monster that most adaptations go for.  If you're in the mood for a light-hearted romp through a fantasy setting and don't mind a little extra cheese than most movies today are made with, definitely check this movie out.",1370390400,,655,4.52542372881356

1420291,3,B00005B222,"This is a grand story for girls between the ages of 8 and 12; if you have some that fall in that age range and enjoy romantic fantasy this movie is a must see. What one finds here is a mix of Narnia and Lord of the Rings repackaged for little girls. The bad guys are suitably comic and the good guys mix bluster and heroics in a manner that often elicits a chuckle.

The movie is long; at 3 hours it takes a lot of time to watch the entire movie. There are two parts and occasional blackouts for commercial breaks which reveal the TV origin of the movie. The movie is lightweight and non-threatening for children but is sufficiently well done to marginally hold the attention of the adult fantasy fan.

The little ones may well enjoy it and some of the adults will find it tolerable especially if they are sympathetic to the fantasy genre.",1358208000,,839,4.30379746835443

1420295,5,B00005B222,"Everyone has their own taste and opinion, but even though this movie is low-budget and a bit cheesy, it doesn't matter to me. I watched it first when I was a kid and was immediately lost in a world of fantasy. Even though I'm an adult now, i'm still in love with the simple yet intriguing charm of this film. I've read the book, ""Voyage of the Basset"" as well, and it doesn't change how much I adore this movie at all.

For what budget they had, they made do and it turned out wonderful. The storyline draws you in, and if you allow yourself to actually HAVE an imagination, the ""cheesy"" aspect shouldn't bother you at all. You should be able to see past it and realize that this movie is literally a treasure for any individuals who love fantasy and adventure.

Give this movie a chance. Rent it, if you must. Ignore the ""Seeing is Believing"" comments and remember the words, ""Credendo Vides"" - By believing, one sees. (:",1306886400,,922,4.385964912280702

If you are a die-hard adaptation purist then I do not recommend this movie. However if you've never read the book I suggest watching the movie and then reading it. There are quite a number of differences.
I thought the costumes and acting were wonderful. I loved the sets and special effects (but I'm easily pleased with special effects). The one part in the movie I cannot stand is the infamous ""Sea Serpant Dance"" I was all set for the movie to spiral into some crazy drug-induced fantasy after that but luckily it did not.
If you love fantasy I highly recommend this movie and the book. This is a very long movie though so the fantasy may not keep kid's attention that long.",1240790400,,830,4.326923076923077

Over all an excelent choice to sit back an enjoy a long pleasent relaxing evening.",1227052800,,335,3.8
1420344,2,B00005B222,"Hallmark releases about 1 - 2 fantasy movies per year, and this one starring Beau Bridges is probably one of the worst ones of this decade.  The story is simple enough, a widowed father and his two daughters travel to a magical kingdom while chased by trolls.  In the kingdom, they meet up with the Minotaur, Medusa, Oberon and Titania from Shakespeare's play, more trolls, a dragon, nymphs, and an assortment of other characters.  The father is a professor, and in the magical kingdom he is prophesized to save them from the trolls.

If this movie came out in 2008, I would say it was a cheap knockoff of the LOTR, Harry Potter, Narnia and Stardust movies.  But since it was actually released in 2001, it seems more like a cheap knockoff of other Hallmark movies.  Here are some examples.  The principal character is a single father with two daughters.  In Hallmark's ""The Tenth Kingdom"" and ""Snow White"", the principal characters were a single father and his daughter.  In this movie, our traveling family encounter a wide array of mythical and fairy tale creatures while sailing on a ship thru a magic kingdom.  In ""The Tenth Kingdom"", the father/daughter duo encounter a wide array of fairy tale creatures while traveling thru a magic kingdome.  In Hallmark's ""Gulliver's Travels"", Gulliver encounters a wide array of characters while sailing around the world.  Then we have the part about a prophecy.  Again, we can look at Harry Potter, Narnia, LOTR, and every other fantasy movie/book out there.  The worse copying was in the look of the trolls; they could have been taken straight from the set of ""The Tenth Kingdom"" without any changes in dialogue, makeup or costume design.

Probably worst of all was the execution of the movie.  In its 3 hours of running time, it has four very long swordfight scenes that probably last a total of 20 minutes.  In all 20 minutes, there is only one scene where someone actually gets cut by a sword; the professor gets sliced across the arm.  I understand Hallmark tries to make family-friendly movies, but the action sequences in this film were so diluted as to be pitiful.  Hallmark's Merlin was a totally acceptable movie for children, and it had very realistic combat scenes that showed people getting stabbed, cut, and hacked to death.  And most of the swordfight scenes suffered from that most horrible of symptoms; opponents would aim to hit the other's sword instead of the other's body.

There were some original scenes in the movie that actually stood out for being good.  Principle among them is the College of Medicine scene that occurs inside a book.  Another original scene is how the professor's family takes Medusa with them on their quest.  However, there were also many original scenes that were just laughably stupid; one good example is when the older daughter, Miranda, summons a mermaid to drive away the sea serpent.  Her song and dance looked like a really bad MTV video.

The casting for this movie was so-so.  The two actresses playing daughters Miranda and Cassandra did not look anything at all like either the mother or father.  For most of the other characters, the costume and make-up more or less disguised true faces.  The only bright spot was the actress casted for Medusa, Kira Clavell.  Her multi-ethnic ancestry gives her an exotic look perfect for a deadly but beautiful creature.

Another letdown was the comedy, or lack thereof.  There were dozens of scenes where a well-placed line or change of detail would have added some laughs.  A good example is when Cassandra sits down to eat with the Minotaur.  He offers her a slab of meat as they sit surrounded by piles of bones.  A more comedic turn would be to have the Minotaur be a vegetarian, and instead of being surrounded by bones of all the animals he has eaten, he is surrounded by all the animals he has stolen from nearby farms to save them from slaughter.

So all in all, this is a bad movie.  It is not worth your time to watch it, or your money to buy it.",1221264000,,3997,4.707492795389049

1420346,5,B00005B222,"I began to watch this movie wondering what it would be like. It was completely different from what I imagined, but, what else is new? The Voyage of The Unicorn was a really good movie, with both good parts and one or to bad parts. The only bad part I can think of is when they had the nerve to make Medusa very un-Medusa-like. She didn't even have WINGS! And, everyone knows that Medusa is supposed to be ugly. In this movie, she was actually quite pretty! Oh, and by the way, fairies don't have vampire teeth like the Fairy Queen did. That was really weird. And I didn't even know she was a queen or a fairy, much less a Fairy Queen. The costuming was pretty good, though. They looked recognizable as trolls, and at least they thought to give Sebastian pointy ears. And the unicorn looked great, just like a real unicorn. The small fairies looked like fairies should, too. The dragon looked liked a dragon, and not like some overgrown winged lizard. The settings looked really nice, too. And when Miranda was thinking about her mother, it looked like she was thinking, and not as if it was just happening right then and there.",1220227200,,1127,4.449275362318841
1420347,4,B00005B222,"Well, it ain't Conan!  But that's OK.  This is clearly a fantasy film aimed at an adolescent girl audience.  Many of the monsters encountered become allies.  The action scenes are more slapstick than violent; physical survival is never in doubt.  Instead it is the soul of a family that is in peril.  Wounded by the untimely death of the mother, can the two sisters and their father repair their relationships with each other and find a way to live with their tragic loss?  Ultimately this is a film about grief and healing, a film which retains a surprising depth and sweetness, given the genre.  And it accomplishes that without sacrificing the spirit of fun and adventure along the way.",1205107200,,689,4.73109243697479
1420348,4,B00005B222,"I started watching this nearly 3 hour film not knowing what to expect. Would it be some generic fantasy adventure with a lot of exploration and a bunch of random encounters, all culminating in a big war scene at the end? That seems to be the formula these days, and I wasn't looking forward to seeing the same formula done again unless it was done with interesting twists.

What I got was a surprisingly different take on the fantasy adventure genre from what I was used to.

""Voyage of the Unicorn"" doesn't waste time setting things up. Early in the film, Goblins storm a family's home with the intent to capture them. The father, Alan, and daughters Miranda and Cassie, find a ship in their hometown being piloted by an elf and a drawf, and end up using it to magically escape to same fantasy land - the very same one their pursuers had come from. Before long, they learn that they are heroes foretold of in a prophecy, and it is up to them to prevent the goblins from storming the ""real world"" and taking it over. The family is naturally not too happy about this, but they're told that even if the prophecy isn't true, they'll have to stop the goblins anyway or risk having to hide from them their entire lives. After all, the goblins believe in the prophecy, and they're not happy about what it means for them.

There are a number of fairly original ideas in this movie. For example, ever notice how often it is that you see a kids' movie where the kids have to save the world without any adult help? Here, however, the father comes along with his daughters and is actively involved all throughout the adventure. Of course, as is to be expected, the kids have their share of moments of heroism, but the family works together throughout the movie, and Alan gets his chance to shine.

The heroes end up encountering several well-known creatures of myth during their journey, such as a sphinx, a minotaur, and Medusa, and actually manage to convert some of them into allies who join them. Even with this small army of now-friendly creatures, the family is not always able to directly fight off most of their threats, and they end up having to deal with them in other ways. There are quite a few moments where they do fight, but mostly they have to sneak around or use trickery on their quest. A family of three plus a handful of mythological creatures do not an army make, and so there's plenty of moments where the heroes need to proceed cautiously or use their wits.

Being a fairly light-hearted story, it does get rather, dare I say, corny at times. Recruiting Medusa, complete with shades designed to prevent her eyes from turning others to stone, into the party is the sort of thing you'd never see in a story that took itself completely seriously. Indeed, there are a number of silly moments and bits of character humor, but there are also moments where the story takes itself completely seriously. The initial encounter with Medusa looked downright nerve-wracking, as Alan, sweating profusely, kept his eyes completely closed and tried not to look at Medusa, while his two daughters, blindfolded, cried their eyes out at their potential fate.

For a low budget, made-for-TV film, the sets and costumes are pretty well designed. The trolls look like what you'd expect them to, Medusa is exceptionally well-done, and all the locations look really nice. I was impressed many times with how everything looked, leaving me to wonder, ""this is made for TV?"" It may not be heavy on the CGI, but sometimes good old fashioned set building is what works best and is most convincing.

Characterization is pretty good as well for such a light story, but unfortunately, the dialog stumbles at times. We get some platitudes on how important it is to believe (in what exactly? Fairy tales?), and have faith in miracles. This comes out of the kids' mouths sometimes, I might add. Most of the time the dialog is good, but at times it gets a bit stiff, particularly when the film's ""message"" is being delivered.

Overall, though, I liked ""Voyage of the Unicorn"". The light mood makes the fantastical proceedings easier to digest, and the story is pretty fun.

1420375,3,B00005B222,"I'm surprised that there are so many 5-star reviews since this movie, while charming, doesn't come anywhere near the 5-star fantasy classics I've seen in the past. A lonely widower (Beau Bridges) and his two young daughters, Miranda and Cassandra, find themselves transported on a magical voyage aboard the ""Unicorn"". It is during this voyage that they meet many legendary creatures, including Oberon, Titania, and Medusa. The journey proves both a harrowing adventure and enlightening experience as they find both their happiness and the memory of their loved one restored.

Now that I've gotten the main plot out of the way, I'll highlight the parts of the film that succeeded and failed to impress me as a fantasy flick.

The Good:

1) Beau Bridges and the two girls make a winningly charming trio. Bridges is a lovable father while Miranda is a sympathetically shy heroine and spunky Cassandra rather reminds me of an American Hermione Granger.

2) The musical score is for the most part pretty; mystical, though decidedly modern.

3) While the special effects left much to be desired, there are a few good standouts: the unicorn, the trolls, the sea-serpent, and the little fairies.

The Bad:

1) While there were some good special effects, some of the costuming was simply awful. For example, while the little fairies were gorgeous and awesome, the big ones were ridiculous. This film's version of Titania, for example, is simply the worst I've ever seen. Sure, not all fairies are supposed to be beautiful, but Titania certainly is! Instead, she looks like a human-preying water fairy, and this is certainly NOT how she's supposed to be portrayed. There was also a creature the film had the nerve to call a dryad. Um, no. If an elf and a mime had a child, this creature would be their offspring, but a dryad it is not. The two worst costumed characters were Medusa and the sphinx. I know Medusa's supposed to be beautiful, but who the heck decided to make her an overly exotic Indian goddess?? With her heavily made-up eyes and gigantic pursed lips, she irritated me so much I could hardly stand looking at her! The sphinx, for me, was the most bitter disappointment. Guess what, people? Putting a woman with springy hair and lionine eye-makeup into fuzzy pants does NOT make a sphinx! Put Medusa and the sphinx together, and you've got what looks like two very bad imitations of pop-stars; I half expected the two to break into ""Survivor"". I'm not sure what kind of joke the Emmy committee was playing by nominating this movie for costuming, but it wasn't a funny one.

2) The movie's tone often alternates between partly serious and totally silly, and I have a very low tolerance for excess silliness. It was this tone that often made it hard for me to take the movie seriously and grated on my nerves. I have mixed feelings about the famed scene in which Miranda dances for the sea-serpent; her dance is totally gorgeous and hypnotic, but the voice singing in the background starts warbling and I had to mute it. (Really singers, STOP doing this. It sounds pathetic, I assure you)

I also found it unnecessary for the film to imply that Titania hypnoticed Miranda in order for her to dance, especially after she told her she didn't need any magical help! This scene is so beautiful; why ruin it by turning Miranda into a puppet? This took away from the scene and only made me dislike Titania more. Besides, the camera focused so long on the sight of Miranda's  eyelashes fluttering on the whites of her eyes that I wanted to smack her in order to make her eyes roll back into place. (By the way, there is no mermaid in this film; only the puppet caricature of one, so don't be disappointed like I was).

All in all, this is a 3-star movie. There are some bad special effects and too much silliness, but the good special effects and overall charm save it from being a bad film.",1142553600,12,3886,4.683284457478006
1420376,5,B00005B222,"The 'Voyage of the Unicorn' is the story of the Aisling family - Professor Alan Aisling and his two daughters - the skeptical, bad-tempered Miranda and the dreamy, absent-minded Cassie. The girls weren't always like this though - they were once happy, sweet-natured girls - till their mother dies that is. Now the family live separate lives though they live in the same house - Alan who devotes his time to preaching his 'cresendo vides' (in believing one sees) philosophy at the university, which does not go down well with the Dean; Cassie who looses herself for days in her mother's portfolio and artwork, neglecting school, food and the real world in general; and Miranda, who has lost most of her faith in the human race and leds an unhappy, discontented life.

All this is about to change however, when their home is attacked one night by a violent group of trolls, who are out to stop a prophesy concerning the Aisling family from coming true. While Miranda and Mr Aisling attempt to ward them off, Cassie is whisked off by an elf - Sebastian, and a dwarf - Malachi, down to the docks where their ship, The Unicorn waits. Followed closely by Miranda and Professor Aisling, all of them are spirited away to the Landscape of the Imagination on board the magical, beautiful ship which has been specially prepared for them.

It is there that they discover their destiny from King Oberon and Queen Titania on the Isle of Faerie - it has been prophesied that 'a man of learning, and two maidens gentle of spirit' will enter the realm to free the land of the evil scourge of trolls by finding and summoning the great dragon - and at the same time freeing heroes of old.

And so they're off on their journey - with Malachi and Sebastian, who is smitten with Miranda, and on the way they have run-ins with legendary creatures such as a sea serpent, trolls, mermaids, fairies, Medusa, the Sphinx, the Minotaur, ogres, unicorns and more.

It is this voyage that the movie excells in - great costumes, set design, special effects, a beautiful soundtrack that includes the song - 'Faith precedes a Miracle', and good acting and story telling. Watch out for my favourite scenes - when Miranda subdues the sea serpent, when Cassie tames the unicorn and when Titania gives each member of the family special gifts, and special advice that only they can hear.

This is a very good movie - it's interesting, bright, colourful, well directed and acted throughout. Traditional creatures such as fairies are given a whole new look and it's a great family movie to all watch together. If you love fantasy and adventure then this movies for you.

**Spoilers below**

However, one fault is that it ended rather abruptedly, and with far too many unanswered questions and loose ends. My queries include:

How did they get home? - they all just seemed to wake up the next day with no real recollections of the entire voyage!
What happened to the Sphinx? - she saves Cassie and then disappears.
Was Lily (the girls' mother) really a 'spiritual guide'? How did she know about the Unicorn and the Landscape of Imagination?
What happened to the disgraced Oberon?
Did Sebastian and Miranda really get together?
Why did Professor Aisling pick up all those rocks from the different islands? - it looked like it would be an evolving story line but nothing came of it.
Too many unanswered questions!!!

Despite this however, this is a great fantasy in a world of generic and regurgitated ""Lord of the Rings"" stories - this one stands on its own and is *finally* on DVD!",1123718400,46,3539,4.695161290322581
