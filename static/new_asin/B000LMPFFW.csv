2710302,5,B000LMPFFW,"After only a week of Dr. Gottlieb's exercises, taking, as claimed, only a few minutes per day, I find I can read most print without glasses. It is still a bit of a strain to do so, and the very finest print on the chart still eludes me now and then, but the overall improvement is spectacular. My glasses are moderately corrected for close work and I have mild astigmatism, which doesn't seem to interfere. I think anyone with serious astigmatism should probably contact the Institute before purchasing the Method, but for general presbyopia this method really works as advertized, and quickly.",1299110400,16,594,4.833333333333333
2710303,5,B000LMPFFW,"When doing the exercises, my vision improved. In fact, I was able to read several pages in a book without my glasses--for the first time in many years!

Fair warning, you have to keep doing the exercises. I stopped, and my vision reverted to not being able to read anything but huge print. I'll start again, and be more dedicated to maintaining my progress this time around. This particular book targets Presbyopia (inability to see close up, fine print). There are other resources for other eye problems.

I really didn't expect this to work at all, but am sick of losing my reading glasses, so thought it was worth a shot. I believe this can work, and will update my review at a later date -- after I've had more time to practice.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Read-Without-Glasses-Method/dp/B000LMPFFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Read Without Glasses Method</a>",1261958400,23,902,5.482014388489208
2710304,5,B000LMPFFW,Just what I needed.  I have been looking for a natural program to improve my close vision.  This works for me.  I have been blessed with good vision all my life (no glasses) and I am 64.  About 10 years ago my close vision began to deteriorate.  I have been taking anti oxidants and bilberry for my vision for many years.  Recently added taurine which is improving my close vision.  This eye exercise progam has improved my close vision in just 1 month.,1259020800,24,453,4.385542168674699

2710326,5,B000LMPFFW,I'm a pilot and this has helped me to avoid the dreaded glasses!!!. You do need to practice regularly in order to maintaining results. but it only takes a couple minutes a day. My only criticism is that I wish they would provided more exercises with the current without the up sale.,1416700800,,282,4.4423076923076925
2710327,4,B000LMPFFW,"40 bucks for a 30 mins video that show you 2 techniques on improving your vision. Worth it? well not for me, unless they really made a difference in my eyes which I do not know yet.

Update: it work, I see things clearer now, but the progress is slow.

08/2015 Update: The product is actually vision therapy. It works on your convergence & divergence. Of course vision therapy is more than just this. If you into this kind of thing, go to your local optometrist and ask them to refer you to vision therapist specialist. I change my mind now, the price this product offers is actually very reasonable. 1 section of vision therapy would cost $120. Thank go my insurance covers it. Combined w/ vision therapy and this, my focusing ability improves dramatically.",1414886400,2,758,4.607407407407408

2710329,5,B000LMPFFW,"A simple, effective, wonderful program for people with presbyopia.  Conventional wisdom has it
that nothing can be done for ""old eyes"", but Dr. Gottlieb thinks otherwise.  The exercises are so
easy and work so rapidly, you find yourself amazed that you can read the fine print much better
almost immediately.  This is a true gem.",1388707200,,329,4.945454545454545

2710331,5,B000LMPFFW,"I've been doing these vision exercises for a few weeks. Within a week or two, I noticed an improvement in my vision for reading. I have worn reading glasses since my early 40s, over 20 years. I have presbyopia, middle-aged vision, where your vision deteriorates, particularly near vision. I've done a couple of other helpful eye exercise programs. But the one I was using the last few years, the one by the American Vision Institute, I was just too bored with and it didn't seem to do enough for me for time spent--half hour a day. I couldn't bring myself to continue with the exercises and I had to buy stronger glasses at the pharmacy to read the computer. That was alarming.

""Read Without Glasses,"" unlike the other programs, is specifically designed for Presbyopia. I watched the DVDs and learned the exercises in about an hour. I do the exercises for about 5 minutes a day. I've been able to go back to my weaker glasses. I don't know that I'll get to the point that I can actually read without glasses, but I'm making progress.

Other strategies that help are to let my eyelids sink down low over my eyes and blink often while reading. I used to go to an expensive ophthamologist for glasses. I have an astigmatism, but even so, the magnifying glasses that I get at the pharmacy work just fine for reading.

I also do highly recommend the inexpensive book by the American Vision Institute. It's very helpful, and I think it's likely excellent for near-sightedness and far-sightedness. For presbyopia, however, I recommend ""Read Without Glasses.""",1358640000,8,1552,4.719557195571956
2710332,5,B000LMPFFW,"I've been using this method for a few months, and am pleased with the results. My near vision had been getting worse over the past few years, and my optometrist prescribed reading glasses, which would cost way more than the cost of this method (since the vision in my eyes were different, she advised against store-bought reading glasses).  I noticed improvement after about 4 or 5 days of using the method.  Nothing miraculous, but noticeably better.  I can see about 3 or 4 inches closer, which means instead of having to read something at arms length, I can hold it with a slightly bent arm and read it fine. I have also noticed that the speed at which I can focus from a near object to a far object (e.g., reading a book and then looking at someone who has walked into the room 10 feet away) has improved.

What you get is an ""eye chart"" and a dvd.  The dvd shows you how to use the eye chart, among some other things.  The eye chart is basically a page with text, which when read as instructed, exercises your eyes in order to improve your near vision. While some have characterized it as ""looking at the chart cross-eyed"", it is a bit more than that.  The chart is used two different ways.  First, your eyes are ""crossed"" in order to bring the right and left halves of the chart together to be viewed as a single ""3D"" picture.  When done properly, you see the text with depth, as if it were a 3D picture. By reading the text, the eyes get exercised.  Apparently, there is a link between the crossing of the eyes and the focusing ability of the eye.  Reading the chart causes your eyes to focus more. When used as intended, the chart allows you to hold a particular amount of crossing of the eyes while reading, permitting the eyes to focus on the text at a distance closer than one would be able to otherwise.  The second way the chart is used is sort of like those ""magic eye"" pictures where you look past the picture and see a 3D image.  With the chart, you look past the picture and see the text in 3D, and then try to focus on the text while reading it.  I think this is supposed to train the eyes to focus without being crossed. I've left out of lot of detail on how how this is all done, but hopefully you get the gist.

Now, you do have to keep doing the exercises to maintain your near vision.  I have found that if I don't do the exercises for 5 days or more, my near vision starts getting worse.  I try to do them every day, or at least every other day.  They recommend doing it for 6 minutes a day.

Keep in mind that not everybody can do this method.  They provide a test you can use to see if you can do the method.  It basically tests your ability to control your eyes in a manner necessary for the method.  Check their website.  I have shown the method to three other people.  One person could do it, but with some difficulty.  The other two could not do it at all.  So, it is not for everybody, but it has worked well for me.",1343260800,12,2947,4.180851063829787
2710333,5,B000LMPFFW,"So far, I have only used this chart four days and already my reading vision is greatly improved.  I no longer need reading glasses for books or the newspaper, but still need it for the phone book.  I expect that to change within a month.  From what I've heard and what I know about improving your vision, I think it is best to continue using this method indefinitely, at least once a day for six minutes.  But that's nothing.  Thank you, Dr. Gottlieb!",1317859200,5,451,4.385542168674699
8162174,5,B000LMPFFW,Clear and consise. Now it is only the hard work of repeating the excercises every day :-),1505433600,,89,4.294117647058823
8162175,5,B000LMPFFW,"The video is 30 minutes long which to me is just the right length. I found the exercises a little tough for me at the beginning; however, this applies to anything we learn in life. I found that if you just 'relax' like they say you should and 'let go', you'll be able to do these exercises.

Trial and error, patience, persistence, and relaxation is what you need. The first day, I did them about 3 times during the day being able to do the 1st exercise well. Not so much the 2nd exercise. There are just 2 exercises; nonetheless, outstanding in and of themselves.

The second day, I was able to get the 2nd exercise down pat (after practicing several times during the day). This is just my experience. Others may need to work at it to 'get it'. If you are getting frustrated, give yourself some grace and try it again later. This is not rocket science, it's just training your eyes to do something that you aren't normally accustomed to.

I bought this because I was at the beginning stage of that time in my 40s where small print was difficult to read. So my vision to read small print is not that bad but starting down that road.

I have to say without exaggeration, that after doing these exercises after just 2 days, I was able to read the small print without straining or having any blurred vision.

Amazing. Again, this is just my experience. Others will have to try it out for themselves. This DVD is Outstanding. Short, simple, to the point, and exercise time is just a few minutes a day. I'm sure the price of this video is a small price to pay for what you get back in return. As a side note, my eye charts were physically included with my purchase.",1501200000,,1660,4.341935483870968
8162176,5,B000LMPFFW,"Well worth it! I am still using readers BUT my near sight has improved by using the training methods. This is one of those self-help hacks (like diet and exercise) that the medical establishment can't make any money on so you don't hear too much about it. Interestingly, since using
The method (5-10 minutes per day) my depth perception seems to have improved as well. I'm not really sure of the mechanism for that - but I'll take it!",1501113600,,434,4.506329113924051
8162177,3,B000LMPFFW,"This merging 2 objects at different placements (black dots placed on the left and right sides of the visual field) is not true Natural Eyesight practice. It is NOT the Bates Method. Merging 2 objects at different placements to form an 'illusion' of a 3rd object 'appearing' to be in the central field, consisting of the two objects merged together is called auto-stereogram, magic eyes. (I call it Artificial 3-D, because it is not true 3 dimensional vision. It is not the normal way the eyes look at a object.) This is a unnatural treatment used by some eye doctors. It can CAUSE double vision, wandering, crossed eyes. Doctors warn to not use auto-stereograms if there is any form of strabismus present. But; many people who do not have strabismus (wandering, crossed eye) have developed strabismus, double vision after using auto-stereograms.

I prefer a completely natural, safe method; to place ALL 3 objects in the CENTRAL field; one close, one middle, one far. Then; look back and forth 'close, middle, far' at them. This produces and improves the eyes' TRUE accommodation, convergence, un-accommodation, divergence. This is TRUE Natural Eyesight practice, the Bates Method.

Dr. Bates also improves the close and far vision naturally by teaching the patient how to read fine and microscopic print; bringing the print closer and closer and reading smaller and smaller print. This reverses and prevents presbyopia, blurry close vision, cataract. It also automatically improves the far vision. To be done WITHOUT glasses.

3 star because some of these doctors who try to teach Natural Eyesight practices do get some things correct. BUT; choose carefully. Study the original doctor's method; Ophthalmologist Bates;

Then you will know what to choose and what to avoid from other doctors.

A Natural Eyesight teacher 'Martin Sussman' also teaches the Artificial 3-D and other practices. He refers to Dr. Gottlieb's Artificial 3-D DVD, Book. There is a warning to NOT do the Artificial 3-D if there is any strabismus in the eye. 85% of Sussman's teaching is natural, effective. Some is not. His books were helpful when I started studying more information about Natural Eyesight practice in 1995. I tried the Artificial 3-D but did not stay with it because it caused double vision. Problem corrected itself after I stayed with only the TRUE Natural Eyesight practices. Sussman teaches a lot of other practices. Example; shifting and looking close, middle and far are very helpful.",1487462400,2,2701,5.501204819277109
8162178,3,B000LMPFFW,"I received this DVD and began practicing the Read Without Glasses methods they demonstrated.
Concerning their customer support: After a week, I was unable to practice their Part 2 exercises, so I emailed them asking if they could make some recommendations. No response after waiting a week, so I called their support number and left a message. Their automated system states they return calls within one business day, which they did. A representative left me a voice mail stating they had not received any email from me and to email her directly, which I did. Still no response, so I called again and left another voice mail message with my exact email address. I finally received an email, but they still said they had no record of my emails. They asked for a good time to call me, so I sent that information to them. It's been almost three weeks and still no resolution.

Concerning the method itself: I was able to practice Part 1 successfully but only Part 2 occasionally. I began practicing six minutes a day like they recommend, but I didn't notice any difference in my near vision. I increased the practice times from once a day to 2 - 3 times a day. After nearly three weeks, still no change in my near vision; however, my left eye has been watering for years, and I did notice a slight decrease in that.

I will follow up with any additional information if something changes or I get better results.",1483574400,2,1407,4.579365079365079
8162179,5,B000LMPFFW,"My reading vision started getting blurry a couple years ago and I resorted to reading glasses.  I was getting too dependent upon reading glasses and sometimes couldn't even read the dashboard of my car.

After practicing this method for one day II could read without glasses for parts of the next day.  The morning is always more difficult.  After a week I can read most of the day without glasses.
