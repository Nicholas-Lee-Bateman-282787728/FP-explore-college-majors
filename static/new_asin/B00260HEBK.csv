8351547,5,B00260HEBK,Good entertainment for third generation fans. However a better solution to the power issue would probably be a 350 Chevy crate engine swap.,1467244800,,139,5.086956521739131
8351548,4,B00260HEBK,"I enjoyed this program where they took a stock third gen Camaro and made mods to improve fuel efficiency and bump up horsepower. Then, on the second half, they take out the motor and totally revamp it, with all sort of great goodies. Frankly, I thought they would be able to get more power out of the engine, but they increased the HP from 144 to close to 190 HP which, although nothing amazing, I am sure made a big difference. And they did this while improving MPG by almost and additional 3 miles to the gal. That's pretty good.

Yes, they could've stretched the program to over an hour, but I do not base the value in this case on how many minutes long the show is, but rather on the quality of the info, and there's plenty of it to justify the price.",1371427200,,755,4.206896551724138
8351549,2,B00260HEBK,"Short, basic info. Almost not worth watching let alone pay $10 for. Buy a different powerblock DVD. Look for one over an hour long.",1355443200,,131,4.5
