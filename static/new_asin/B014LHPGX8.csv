7414790,5,B014LHPGX8,"The Hurricane is an old Classic that takes place on a south sea Island.  The story is told in a flashback, by Actor Thomas Mitchell, Dr. Kersaint, as a ship passes the ruins of a small village on an uninhabited island.  Staring a young Dorthy Lamour  and Jon Hall and a not so young Raymond Massey.  Mary Astor, a star of silent films, who successfully to talkies, is the wife of Raymond Massey. All the actors play their parts very well.  Jon Hall is Terangi,  a young islander who marries Dorthy Lamour, Marama a beautiful young native of the islands.  Through a series of misunderstandings, Terangi is sent to prison for six months and ends up staying for 8 years.  The climax of the film is the Hurricane.  In a day when there was no CGI, the special effects are great, you feel the storm.  Dorthy Lamour and  Mary Astor were slightly injured when they were tied to a tree and pounded with hundreds of gallons of water. The story flows well and keeps you interested.  I enjoyed this film very much

7414791,5,B014LHPGX8,"For lovers of the disaster genre, this film is a must to add to your collection. Unlike the weak plots of the 70s/80s disaster films, this John Ford work has a great moral-driven story that holds up as a great drama film on it's own. But make no mistake, it's the visual hurricane scenes that is the draw of this movie.
Here, almost 80 years from the release of this fine classic film, the hurricane hits the viewer as impactful as the characters in the movie. It is simply awe-inspiring- a major achievement for its time that is still tremendous today. With the technological advances in computer-generated special effects today, that really speaks volumes about this film!",1453075200,,674,4.769230769230769
7414792,5,B014LHPGX8,"The Hurricane is one of director John Fords most popular films of the 1930s, largely on the strength of its spectacular visual effects. Based on the novel by James Norman Hall and Charles Nordhoff that was first serialized in The Saturday Evening Post, the film follows the plight of Terangi (Jon Hall, Arabian Nights), a native of the French-controlled island Manakoora. After marrying his childhood sweetheart, Marama (Dorothy Lamour, Road to Morocco), Terangi takes a job on a ship. While docked in Tahiti, Terangi gets into a fight with a white man, an offense punishable by a prison term. Strict French governor DeLaage (Raymond Massey) is bound to uphold the law. Appeals made by a doctor (Thomas Mitchell), priest (C. Aubrey Smith), the ships captain (Jerome Cowan), and the governors own wife (Mary Astor) fail to change DeLaages resolve.

This begins a chain of events that entangles the freedom-loving Terangi in an ever-tightening web of white justice. Terangi escapes many times only to be captured and sentenced to longer and longer terms. Each time he gets away, he tries to return to Manakoora and his beloved Marama, while DeLaage, with Javert-like obsession, relentlessly pursues him. The personal story of the two lovers is underscored by the theme of institutional colonialism. The conflict is between personal freedom and oppressive, racist, imposed laws.

One of Hollywoods earliest disaster films, The Hurricane features a 15-minute climactic sequence created by special-effects wizard James Basevi, who was responsible for the earthquake scenes in San Francisco a year earlier. The hurricane scenes were directed not by Ford, but by an uncredited Stuart Heisler, a fact acknowledged by Ford himself. Though filmed nearly 80 years ago without benefit of computer enhancement, these scenes still pack an impressive dramatic wallop. The Moon of Manakoora, written by Frank Loesser (lyrics) and Alfred Newman (music) for this film, was recorded by Dorothy Lamour in 1937 and became an American pop standard.

Special features on the Blu-ray release, newly remastered in high definition, include audio commentary by film historian Joseph McBride, author of Searching for John Ford: A Life, and the original theatrical trailer.",1450569600,,2244,5.351274787535411

7414795,2,B014LHPGX8,"As others have said here, this is a great film. So it was a disappointment when I popped this in my Blu Ray player to find what seems to be a hi def transfer made from a standard def master. Basically the same thing any new Blu Ray player can do today which is upres a dvd. This film deserves a proper restoration and at least a hi def scan from the best available sources (eg: original negative or fine grain master) highlights are blown out, contrast is flat and the transfer exhibits unsteadiness and loss of detail. all the problems with taking a standard def master that was poorly made to begin with and blowing it up to hi def. very disappointing.",1448409600,10,654,4.32520325203252
7414796,5,B014LHPGX8,"I'm compelled to add something which other fine reviewers here do not specifically establish; and that is this:
I have never, in all my life of movie watching, EVER seen a movie where one woman is so fantastically gorgeous as Dorothy Lamour is in this film.  In fact, in no other movie I've seen is Dorothy Lamour HERSELF as staggeringly beautiful as she is in this film.  Even in the classic ""Road"" films of Hope & Crosby, where Ms. Lamour is presented as an epitome of beauty...there is no comparison to the stunning radiance (in black & white, no less) she exudes in The Hurricane.  Who else...Rita Hayworth...Sophia Loren...Garbo...Monroe...ETC...there are many beautiful Hollywood women...but in my opinion, no other star, in no other movie, has ever equaled the perfectly-ripe preciousness of sheer beauty at its absolute peak (which on mortal Earth must be temporary) as the jaw-dropping heavenly work of attractive art that Dorothy Lamour personifies in this movie.  Thank you.",1444435200,2,985,5.099378881987578
8731339,5,B014LHPGX8,"My favourite periods of John Ford are the thirties and forties, which brings me to my review of The Hurricane. This is a big action picture with an intense story of prejudice and greed, which escalates with natures uncontrollable and unexpected urge to erupt. The script builds the tension between its characters and then Mother Nature has plans of her own. When I first saw this movie, I was completely taken by surprise with the level of craftsmanship of the special effects! This is quite a spectacle and a wonderful adventure!",1509667200,,530,4.835164835164835

8731341,5,B014LHPGX8,"Kino Lorber has released the two most impressive disaster movies made before World War II:
-- ""The Hurricane"" (MGM 1937)  is an important film from an important director. REVIEWED ON THIS PAGE
-- ""Deluge"" (RKO 1933) is the cheesy first effort of a 22 year-old director who went on to a long career in B-Movies:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deluge-Blu-ray/dp/B01MRW00P5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deluge [Blu-ray</a>]
Nevertheless, both films receive the deluxe treatment with helpful commentary tracks.
""The Hurricane"" is clearly the greater film, but ""Deluge"" was actually the more innovative production.

Kino Lorber has released both films on Blu-Ray:
""The Hurricane"" comes with a commentary track and movie trailer.
The Blu-Ray image still has some scratches, but the sound is clear.
My only complaint is that it does not have English subtitles.
""Deluge"" also includes a commentary track, and this time Kino Lorber provides English subtitles.

Today, with CGI (computer generated imagery) it's easy for Hollywood to create spectacular special effects, but eighty years ago special effects artists really were artists.
The thirties are remembered for horror movies (Universal) and science fiction (King Kong, Flash Gordon),
but one special effects genre that basically had to wait until the 1970s was the disaster film.

""The Hurricane"" (MGM-1937) was produced using the primitive special effects technology of the 1930s:
A Pacific island is destroyed in fifteen minutes by a hurricane and tidal wave.
There was some use of miniatures, but most of the filming involved putting actors on a soundstage and dowsing them with firehoses.
The actors included 74 year-old C. Aubrey Smith who emerged none-the-worse-for-wear from the experience (he lived another eleven years).
Directed by the legendary John Ford.
Impressive.

But the first disaster film of the sound era was ""Deluge"" (RKO-1933), where New York City is destroyed in five minutes by an earthquake and tidal wave.
New York was accurately recreated with six foot tall buildings, then reduced to rubble by vibrating platforms and a fire hose.
The actors got a little wet, but nothing like what happens in ""The Hurricane"".
Directed by the non-legendary Felix Feist.
Cheesy (but entertaining).

""Deluge"" is very much a pre-code film.
The threat of rape in post-apocalyptic New York is a major theme of ""Deluge"" (termed ""molestation"" in the film).
Female star Peggy Shannon plays an Olympic swimmer, giving her an excuse to wear a bikini in much of the film (they didn't become popular in America until after World War II).
More revealing than Dorothy Lamour's Tahitian costume in ""The Hurricane"".
The Hollywood Production Code went into effect between the two films.

Together with his young associate director Stuart Heisler and effects experts like James Basevi, Ford came up with a much better film than even the producer Sam Goldwyn had envisioned.  Classic Ford casting of Raymond Massey, Mary Astor young Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour and the story-teller Thomas Mitchell is perfect.  What's not to enjoy ?",1466985600,,433,4.986111111111111
