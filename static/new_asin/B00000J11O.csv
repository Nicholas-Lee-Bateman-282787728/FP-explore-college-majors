7911788,5,B00000J11O,"IN THE DOGHOUSE is a wonderful and refreshing film to watch. The presence of the always talented and adorable Trevor Morgan (Jurassic Park III, A Rumor of Angels), combined with the precise and insightful direction of George Miller, is a combination that just can't fail. Rhea Perlman also stars as a talent agent for animals who is all set to begin work on a major film featuring the family's dog, and then the unthinkable happens--the pooch is dognapped. Watch the antics that ensue as they search for the missing dog. It was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. The only thing that could make it better is if someone would release it on DVD. I'm ready to buy it right now and I'll give my VHS copy to a friend.",1246233600,,720,4.546153846153846
