3121157,4,B001411S1O,I just bought Munchkin Math:  Telling time and Counting Money DVD for my four year old. She loves it!  The theme is engaging enough and she is learning a lot.  Both DVD's are about 20-30 minutes duration with catchy tunes and funny characters.  I highly recommend these products for parents with preschoolers who want to teach time and money concept to their little ones in a fun and informative way.,1268006400,,400,4.671428571428572
3121158,5,B001411S1O,"This is the second Munchkin Math DVD we purchased for our children, and they like this one just as well as they did the Shapes one.  The characters are different but very cute and funny (even for an adult to enjoy!)  The wizard is a little corny but he makes them laugh out loud every time we watch it.  The kids are always rooting for Cuckoo (the little bird) to learn to tell time so he can earn his very own cuckoo clock.  Like the Shapes DVD, there are many little chants for the kids to learn to help them remember important things about telling time.  So after watching it a couple times the kids go around repeating them and then recall those tips when we're practicing how to read the clock.  Overall a very useful learning tool and fun for the kids to watch too.",1243641600,2,771,4.2465753424657535
3121159,5,B001411S1O,I own all of these and will purchase any more they make!  Great series!,1233187200,,71,4.071428571428571
3121160,5,B001411S1O,"I thought kindergarteners might look on this series with disdain, but my class loved it and everyone knew to tell time by the end of the year!  Even the first and second graders that I tutored after school got into it.  Wendy covers all the basics in an organized fashion, but with a highly motivating story line and a fast pace.

My kindergarteners also enjoyed Munchkin Math Shapes, and LOVED trapping the Zoid with paper triangles!  I'm teaching preschool next year, and have ordered the money dvd too.  Congratulations, Wendy, on a winning series!",1214092800,14,551,4.819148936170213
3121161,5,B001411S1O,"I absolutely love this series of DVDs from Munchkin Math!  My children who are 3 and 2 years old love them so much and have learned their shapes, started to learn to tell time and count money!!!  This is an amazing tool for every parent to use to make math fun.  I was never into math, but I hope to foster great enjoyment in my own children through tools like this.  I would recommend the whole series, as it is fun, colorful and keeps a child's attention.  I also think this would be a great tool for teachers and homeschoolers!",1213574400,11,530,4.26

8253897,3,B001411S1O,It's okay.  Was a bit corny.  My son (5 at the time) doesn't seem interested in seeing it again.,1426550400,,96,4.0

8253899,5,B001411S1O,"I had so much trouble learning how to tell time. My teachers didn't even try to help me  so when I had my first baby I searched for a DVD to help my kids. It holds my 3 and 1 1/2 yr olds attention it's simple.  I thank them for a great product.
*****update******* my oldest is in first grade now. (2017) He just started the lesson on telling time. He asked to watch this video to remind him on how to tell time. It's fun and effective. We have watched this on and off over the past few years. We still love it! Thanks again for such a wonderful dvd!!",1356220800,,550,3.945945945945946
8253900,4,B001411S1O,"My daughter loved the songs in this video.  It definitely helped her understand time a bit better, but I don't know that she has truy mastered it.

She is only 4, but she has been so curious about time that I got it for her.  She does know how to tell time to the hour, but everything after that was a bit confusing.  Perhaps she is still too young, so we may go back to it and she'll catch on to the other parts more easily.",1316736000,2,425,3.9069767441860463
8253901,3,B001411S1O,"Munchkin Math has certainly helped my nephew get familiar with telling time. Although he still has some difficulty grasping the concept, I can see that he's not so hesitant to answer me when I ask him to tell me what time it is.",1316563200,2,228,4.325581395348837
8253902,5,B001411S1O,"My daughters 5 and 20 months both enjoy this dvd. It has catchy rhymes that teacher the basic concepts of time (hour hand, minute hand, 60 seconds, 60 minutes, etc.). I would recommend it as a tool to help teacher your child to tell time.",1306108800,,238,4.311111111111111

8253904,5,B001411S1O,"I have a 6 yr old daughter with Down Syndrome and a 3 yr old with Autism. This DVD kept their attention and wasn't too much over their heads. It wasn't overstimulating or too silly cartoonish either. The have a boy and girl at a playground help teach, the creator, Wendy teaches with a blue screen behind her a clock and they also have cuckoo bird cartoon character. They had some good ways to help the kids learn and remember the concepts with clapping and sing-song phrases. I think this is a great resource and explains telling time very well and in a clear yet fun manner.",1294617600,5,576,4.392523364485982
