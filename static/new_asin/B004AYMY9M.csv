In any event, finally watched it last night, and I found it stunning.  Can't recommend it too highly.",1348963200,3,259,4.468085106382978
8421259,5,B004AYMY9M,I enjoy foreign films. They are more realistic than most American films and this one is no exception.  It is a well acted and told story that allows you to get a feel for the characters in the story.,1303171200,3,199,4.102564102564102
8421260,5,B004AYMY9M,"Franois Ozon ('Time to Leave', 'Swimming Pool', 'Under the Sand', '8 Women', 'Angel', etc) continues to bring to his films a sense of intimate relationships offered in a style of filmmaking that makes them personal and unique.  He often uses the same actors for his films, a trait that makes his work seem truly ensemble in nature.  HIDEAWAY (Le Refuge) is a story about the tapestry of love in all its forms and as written by both Ozon and Mathieu Hippeau it is a delicate view of the many facets of relationships.

Mousse (Isabelle Carr) and Louis (Melvil Poupard) are young and wealthy and deeply in love, but they are addicted to drugs.  In an extended almost wordless scene we watch them inject themselves with heroin in a luxurious Parisian apartment.  Days of drug induced idyll are suddenly disrupted one morning when Louis' mother (Claire Vernet) arrives and discovers the couple: Louis is dead from an overdose but Mousse survived and is taken to a hospital where she finally awakens and is informed she is pregnant.  After the funeral and burial of Louis, his mother convinces Mousse that Louis must have no heir and sends the confused Mousse her off to terminate the pregnancy.  Louis brother Paul (Louis-Ronan Choisy) looks on, empathizing with Mousse.

Some months pass and we find Mousse in a seaside country house where she is a recluse during the pregnancy she has decided to keep: Mousse is now controlling her addiction with Methadone.  Her only outside contact is the grocer Serge (Pierre Louis-Calixte) who delivers her food until Paul stops by to pay a visit.  Mousse allows Paul to stay in her hideaway and they become friends - Paul admits to Mousse that he is not Louis' blood brother but was rather adopted. Paul is gay and not a threat to the very pregnant Mousse.  Paul goes into town, meets Serge, and a love affair ensues. The manner in which Mousse and Paul relate and together with Serge form a type of family leads to a rather surprising ending.  How the shared relationship with Louis (Mousse's lover and source of her pregnancy and Paul's longtime admiration of his adopted brother) bonds the two provides a surprising but satisfying ending to the story.

Isabelle Carr is radiant as the conflicted Mousse and both Poupard (despite the brevity of his role) and Choisy are excellent.  This is quality, quiet, intimate filmmaking at its finest.  Another little masterpiece from Franois Ozon.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, February 11",1298592000,5,2484,4.862232779097387
