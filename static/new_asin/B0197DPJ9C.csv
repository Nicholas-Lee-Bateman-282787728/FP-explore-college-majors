7564894,2,B0197DPJ9C,"I loved Season 1 and have re-watched it several times.  I thought it worth 5 stars for the complexity of the characters, the beauty of the stately home of the wealthy Bligh family, the costumes, and most importantly its depiction of how some of the characters were recovering from the ravages of WWII.  I downgraded Season 2 as the lead character Sarah became more saintly and the evil sister-in-law Regina spun her web of deceit and lies, but it still was worth watching for the sub plot of homophobia in 1950's Australia.  Then I tried to watch the first episode of Season 3 and gave up:  the soap suds obliterated the script and the characters of Sarah and Regina became caricatures.  I will watch no more.",1452124800,19,709,4.595238095238095
7564895,3,B0197DPJ9C,"A Place to Call home is beautifully filmed. The direction is spot on. The Actors truly embody their roles. The story line is set perfectly in its time and place. It's just a few years beyond WW2 in the Australian countryside. Not quite the Rough and tumble outback. Yet, their is plenty of high drama going on in this town. The Family is the Scion of the area and their lives keep A Place To Call Home one of this decade's finest World Class television offerings. It's must see T.V. Now, if only Acorn could be so kind as to air the last 6 episodes of season 3 right now. If you've not seen seasons 1 or 2 yet, do subscribe to Acorn. It's all U.K television and that's magnificent T.V.",1451174400,14,685,4.236641221374046

7564920,3,B0197DPJ9C,"I loved seasons 1 and 2.  The actors were all strong and convincing.  Although there was quite a bit of sobbing without tears.  As the episodes went on, too much focus was put on Regina (why?).  The more outrageous her behavior, the more idiotic it made the other characters become.  How could anyone believe her?  Regina was overdone, in many ways, and it ruined the series for me.  I found myself skipping through her parts. Such a shame, the other actors were wonderful to watch,",1483574400,,482,4.6

7564935,5,B0197DPJ9C,"The Golden Globes have a weird rule about series nominations requirements, I wonder who made the HFPA add this rule about series having U.S. funding and being a U.S. co-production in order to be eligible for nominations. FOXTEL is owned by News Corp. Australia which in turn owned by New Corp. aka Fox, for the HFPA to rule out any nominations for season 3 of a APTCH is utterly shameful. Marta Dsseldorp, Noni Hazelhurst, and Sara Wiseman are all amazing actresses. The writing and directing are spectacular and production values are on par with Downton Abbey.",1478044800,,561,4.854166666666667

7564937,4,B0197DPJ9C,"A strong script by Bevan Lee and stunningly great acting shine through all three seasons, leaving ""Downton Abbey"" in the dust. Lee's characters must have been a delight for the actors to interpret. Until the last few episodes of Season 3, the credibility of the characters is unquestioned. Sarah (Marta Dusseldorp) and Elizabeth (Noni Hazlehurst) evolve and grow in ways that are humanly authentic and believable.

The writing in the later episodes of Season 3 seemed to me a little ragged. It's not hard to believe that Regina would gather actionable intel while wandering through Ash Hall or pick up tittle-tattle in Inverness but drugs and rat poison and an intelligence network worthy of the CIA?  Whenever two or more people are gathered in conversation at Ash Park, Regina lurks then lurches into the scene in her relentless pursuit of George. She suborns maids, hospital nurses, townspeople but to carry all that off, she has to morph into Cruella de Ville and either by script or interpretation, the portrayal  skates close to parody.

What's not to enjoy in the randy little frolics? But in these last episodes, everybody has to get a roll and while one  appreciates their zest, the scenes are too long and too many. George-Sarah, Gino-Anna, Jack-Carolyn, James-Handsome Doctor, Vivian-Lloyd, though, not yet, Douglas-Elizabeth. Sometimes, Tantrically less, is fine.)  The credible Sir Richard rape scene, on the other hand, doesn't fall in that category, it was chillingly believable.

The closing episode of Season 3 fragmented into dramatic scattershot. We were being lured into Season 4 with so many cliffhangers that it was difficult to find a dramatically satisfying focus. A death, a funeral, a marriage, a heart attack, rat poison, coke (or some opioid,) medical accusations against Jack, Vivi's epiphanies, George's mental wrestling with his late-father, Douglas Goddard's optimism, Elizabeth's being led gently into loving honesty, all rich story material but not artistically susceptible to reductionist treatment. It's hard to know if that's a writing weakness or a directorial decision. Fantastic acting and character development are what will bring me back to the Season 4 in a flash--the minute the season shows up here in the U.S..",1478044800,,2256,5.25

7564941,1,B0197DPJ9C,"Guess I am ""old fashioned"".... ( I didn't say from the Victorian times...) Season 3 is pretty clear of bad language, but the unnecessary nudity and all the characters I so came to appreciate deceiving one another and not being upfront was a real disappointment. If the truth sets us free, then most of the characters are living in bondage, and overall they are becoming contrived and less touchable as season 3 goes on. After watching four episodes of this season, I gave up. Switching over and staying with Poldark. What a shame such potential on this show was wasted.",1476662400,,569,4.7

Loyalty to the series and wanting to know how life works out for the characters made it watchable and provided enough fuel to invest time watching Season 4.

7564976,1,B0197DPJ9C,"I keep thinking that this is Australia's answer to Downton Abbey but, unfortunately, it is more of a Down Under version of a politically correct Dallas ---- a terrible, never ending saga of self inflicted pain and sorrow, soap opera.
I do not blame the actors.
The poor dears; it isn't  fault their that they have to work with an idiotic script and plot.
There is never a  moment's relief from the torment these accursed people are experiencing in their pathetic lives.
This family goes from one god awful, self inflicted, traumatic experience after  another.
The only family member who seems to have any awareness of what's going on is the evil matriarch who is behind it all----the rest of the family just wander in and out of scenes wondering what the hell has hit them. Or naively ignorant of what is about to sneak up from behind and deal them yet another body blow.

7565009,5,B0197DPJ9C,"A Place to Call Home: Season 3.  This world-wide hit, an addictive  television period drama from Australia, comes to us after, at one time, having been canceled during the making of season 2. It is still set in the 1950s, not long after the end of World War II.  And it presents new challenges for resolute nurse Sarah Nordmann (Marta Dusseldorp, JACK IRISH) and the prominent Bligh family. We find Sarah, who had converted to Judaism upon her marriage, torn between her traumatized French Jewish husband, who was once a brilliant surgeon but was injured, traumatized in World War II, Dr. Rene Nordmann(Benjamin Winspear, THE BABADOOK), and handsome ex-fianc, George Bligh (Brett Climo, SNOWY RIVER: THE MCGREGOR SAGA).  Meanwhile, the Blighs face their own problems: the marriage between young lovers Anna (Abby Earl) and Gino (Aldo Mignone) is off to a rocky start; new mother Olivia (Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood) tries to keep an all-devouring secret from her husband, James (David Berry) who has secrets of his own; matriarch Elizabeth (Noni Hazlehurst) contemplates life away from Ash Park. Georges sister Carolyn Bligh (Sarah Wiseman) and her lover Dr. Jack Duncan (Craig Hall) are going through a rocky patch.  And the villainous Regina Standish (Jenni Baird) will do anything to get what she wantseven if it means tearing the family apart.  This captivatingly filmed, deeply romantic drama (The Wall Street Journal) deals with weighty themes such as anti-Semitism, sexuality, and social class with intelligence and intrigue.

Things can get pretty soapy in this high-quality costume drama; but the production is always absorbing and action is always set in Australias beautiful scenery. (Though I did get a bit tired of the continued use of a couple of stock scenes of Sydney Harbor to indicate the characters were in that city.)  I, of course, always love female-centered drama, so Im thrilled with this one. Although its odd that the women cast in two major parts, Carolyn and Regina, look quite a bit alike. Never mind, Dusseldorp ably carries this series as she has the previous two.  She runs the gamut, heartbreak to joy with subtlety. And what a pleasure it is to watch her, a beautiful blond grown up woman, who looks nothing like the legions of pretty little Identi-Kit blonds overrunning  movies and TV these days, acting not only in entertainments, but as news and sports people. The episodes are:

Season 2, Episode 10 with New Ending. This episode contains the new ending for Season 2. The show was canceled midseason;  a new finale  made to wrap up the story lines. After the show's unexpected renewal, the creators decided to pick up Season 3 following this cliffhanger. The new ending begins at 37:48.
Season 3, Episode 1. The Things We Do for Love. George has been shot; only Rene and Regina know what happened. Sarah attempts to console Rene, who has been taken into custody. Anna tries to enjoy her honeymoon with Gino while dealing with allegations in a poisonous  letter; she is not aware of her fathers serious injuries.
Episode 2. L'chaim, to Life. George returns to Ash Park, plans to make an important announcement at his welcome-home dinner. Sarah struggles to break the news of her pregnancy to Rene. Anna tells Gino about James's secret; Gino's reaction causes tension in their marriage.
Episode 3. Somewhere Beyond the Sea. Sarah goes to Sydney under  pretense of visiting her sick aunt while Jack keeps an eye on Rene. Mrs. Bligh, now living in the City, joins a charity group. Back at Ash Park, new character Lloyd, an artist friend of Carolyn's, arrives to paint Olivia's portrait. Regina organizes a card party to forward George's political aspirations.
Episode 4. Too Old to Dream. Sarah decides not to go through with an abortion but meanwhile meets a desperate young woman and her mother at the clinic. After a debate about art, new character Sir Richard, newspaper publisher/political figure, challenges Carolyn to write a critique for one of his papers. Olivia dreams about her encounter with Lloyd.
Episode 5. Living in the Shadow. Rene remains cold with Sarah after learning that she's carrying George's baby. One of Regina's threats goes too far; she retreats to the farmhouse she owns, but still proves dangerous. Anna confides in Olivia about her unhappiness, accidentally disclosing the contents of the villainous letter she had received.
Episode 6. In the Heat of the Night. Sarah is ill, fears for the life of her baby. George overhears hospital gossip, wonders if the baby is his. Olivia continues her trysts with Lloyd, while James gets to better know Dr. Fox in Sydney. Also in that city, new character Douglas, who runs a charitable retreat for returned war veterans, visits Elizabeth, declares his feelings for her.
Episode 7. Sins of the Father. On the anniversary of Lewis Bligh's death, George reflects on the troubled relationship he had with his father. Rene accidentally attacks Sarah, decides to undergo  risky brain surgery. Sarah refuses to sign the consent form.
Episode 8. Till Death Do Us Part. Rene goes under the knife, Sarah worries. Gino's dreams are crushed when his grape vines die. On the morning of baby George's christening, Regina, in hopes of proving her loyalty to the family, tries to persuade James to return to Ash Park.
Episode 9. The Mourners' Kadish. George and Regina wed, in what is billed as a marriage of convenience, despite the protests of Elizabeth, Anna and Carolyn. Sarah makes arrangements for Rene to be buried according to Jewish custom. Douglas continues his pursuit of Elizabeth.
Episode 10. The Love Undeniable. Tensions run high at Ash Park. Following an argument with Gino, Anna temporarily moves back home with her family. James tries to talk to his brother-in-law; Gino reveals what he knows about him and the baby, setting off a disastrous chain of events. Olivia examines her options. Carolyn is troubled; Douglas gives Elizabeth an ultimatum. The love triangle of Sarah/George/Regina gets even more venomous.

Hey this is SO unfair; every major character has been left in peril in this cliffhanger ending to end all cliffhanger endings. I, and many people worldwide, I believe, have been following this entertainment.  And we are not residents of the Land of Oz.  How will we even know when season 4 is at hand?  We have waited and waited for DOWNTON ABBEY, GAME OF THRONES, LUTHER, now this Well, this current binge worthy series arrives in a box set, which I received as a review copy. Its three discs run approximately 505 minutes; it has subtitles, good news for those of us not up on our Oz-speak. As extras, it contains the new Season 2, Episode 10 with its proper ending, and a four minute take of that original ending, also a photo gallery. A word to the wise, it does contain violence, sexual situations and nudity. But it would be a pity to miss this family-oriented show because of that.",1459900800,13,6906,4.9576124567474045

7565011,5,B0197DPJ9C,"This new season 3 provides each character with a deep, often dark, issue that creates much relationship conflict. Balanced by gorgeous Aussie panoramas.
A full previously unaired episode from Season 2 is offered as bonus. It had been replaced with a changed final episode last season when the show was said to be cancelled. Then that decision was reversed and a new ending aired (viewable on Season 2 DVD). The lives at Ash Park pick up where the original ending episode ended. Cliffhangers aplenty. Aussie life and strife, mid-1950s period drama continues with excellence. My wife and I both love all 3 seasons and impatiently await 4. There is also a short 4-minute version of the altered Season 2 ending, but make sure you watch the FULL unaltered episode.

Nearly all cast is intact, with a few new added. Sarah (Marta Dusseldorp), Rene (Benjamin Winspear), George (Bett Climo), Elizabeth (Noni Hazlehurst), Jack (Craig Hall), James (David Berry) & Olivia (Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood), Anna (Abby Earl) & Gino (Aldo Mignone), Roy (Frankie J. Holden), Doris (Deborah Kennedy), Carolyn (Sara Wiseman), Regina (Jenni Baird) for one to hate. New: maid Rose (Brenna Harding), Sir Richard (Mark Lee) another to loathe, & Goddard (Robert Coleby) romance for Elizabeth.

Started watching a couple of episodes of Season 3 on the local PBS station, and was very interested in watching what lead up to some of the goings.

7565013,1,B0197DPJ9C,"this is one of the worse series I have ever watched. I think the series ended at season 2 and then it was renewed. the original premise of the show was flawed. I know anti-Semitism exists but the lengths which the mother went to were really unrealistic. then as subplots emerged you wonder if anyone ever actually had a child who knew its parents.
even in 1960 if u married a gay husband u got a divorce- but not in this show.  when u know a woman is a back stabbing bitch(season 3) you invite her to live in your home and then allow her to stay there w/o any chance of a future relationship.!!!

Your husband tries to kill everyone he comes into contact with but when faced with the possibility of changing his life for the better u decide its too risky too chance a dangerous operation. oh no lets let him to continue to hallucinate and try to kill people. did anyone not know the maid was the mother of the child.
I find myself yelling obscenities at the tv over the absurdities of this series which really deteriorates as it progresses. when u go thru 2 seasons of a c program u get hooked to find out the ending in season3 and that was a mistake. if there is a season 4 I will never find out the end.",1456704000,9,1205,4.167381974248927
7565014,4,B0197DPJ9C,"This was recommended because I watch another wonderful Australian series, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. This is not as meticulously researched as Miss Fisher, but it is addictive. The story centers around Sarah, a convert to Judaism who returns to her native Australia in 1953 to attempt to reconcile with her devoutly Catholic mother in Sydney. That doesn't go so well, so she moves to Inverness at the invitation of the wealthy George Blight, who she met on the ship from England. She nursed George's disagreeable mother on the voyage so George offers her a position at the hospital. Of course he falls in love with her, mother objects and all kinds of family and small village problems ensue.

I have just started Season 2 and find the many plot lines addictive. The only thing that bothers me is no one seems to have bothered to find a consultant on Jewish practice in 1953. Sarah is clearly not an observant Jews by any stretch of the imagination. She eats nonkosher food, rides her bike on Yom Kippur and gets romantically involved with a non-Jewish man. Not much different than most of the world's non-observant Jews. So that didn't bother me. But Sarah spent the war in Europe and time in the Ravensbrook concentration camp. Yet when she offers a Hebrew prayer or talks about the sabbath, she and the few other Jewish characters use the Israeli Hebrew pronunciation and accent that no one used outside of Israel in 1953. In Europe, Yiddish was the international language. My Dad spent the war in France and never spoke a word of French. When he had leave, he went to Paris, found the Jewish quarter and spoke Yiddish. Hebrew was also spoken with a Yiddish inflection -- it was shabbos, not shabbat,as they keep saying in this series.

 It isn't a big thing, but it jars me every time it happens. They took so much effort getting the clothes, the cars and the sappy 50s music right, I think they could have found a consultant who knew how Jews spoke in 1953.

Still, they shouldn't keep anyone from giving this a try.",1454803200,7,2026,4.650837988826815

7565016,5,B0197DPJ9C,"Treat yourself to a true viewing gift and watch this brilliant, complex and thoroughly addictive series!
Don't miss A Place to Call Home, an Australian series about to begin its' fourth season later in 2016.
Absolutely riveting! Shakespearean in pitch-perfect dialogue, layering of character development and
interaction, serious - and deeply sensitive and honest - even heroic treatment of the battle between
persisting cultural traditions and changing more enlightened social and political values.

APTCH begins in 1953, featuring an extraordinary cast that makes complex characters totally real,
develops intricately layered relationships, conflicts, post-WWII changing cultural values, pitch-perfect
dialogue, wonderful production values, all detailing aristocratic and staff lives in both Sydney and the
family's country house two hours away. The characters are so real:  we care so much about them,
what happens to them in this most addictive program. Written so smartly, wisely, daringly, several
storylines interweave - no spoiler alerts here!

This is the most beautiful, meaningful, penetrating group of characters, situations, resolutions, villain,
heroes, heroines seen on tv. Bravo to the great Aussie team for doing this - a series intended for only
two seasons, won so many prizes and outpouring of appreciation, joy, and love by Aussies that it got
a third season, and is now preparing its forth. Seasons1-3 available on Amazon, also now showing on PBS.
I bought and watched all 3 and simply can't wait for season 4. WATCH IT! YOU'LL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!
What a gift from DownUnder!  BRAVO to all of them!

P.S For the one reviewer below who found Season 2 ""sudsy,""  I offer ""Shakespearean"" as a far more accurate assessment.",1453852800,19,1741,5.4535315985130115

8744282,1,B0197DPJ9C,"I decided to try watching this show again. Why would I do that? you might (sensibly) ask, when I hated Season 1 so much? Well, a plot twist in Season 2 was spoiled for me. I found out Rene, Sarah's husband, was alive. While characters coming back from the dead in soap operas isn't new, I was intrigued, since this would obviously throw a wrench into the relationship between George and Sarah, the show's Gary Stu and Mary Sue. Plus Rene was a survivor of a concentration camp. So I decided to watch to see where this plot thread went.

Well, I've been punished for my curiosity. It went to really awful places.

It's kind of hilarious that everyone whines about this show being too politically correct and progressive for the 50s. This is the most offensive show I've seen in a long time. At one time or another, it insults gays, Jews, Holocaust survivors, the mentally ill, career-minded women, Italians, the poor--all to prop up George and Sarah. Who are so bland, smug, whiny, and irritating that you'll want to punch them both in the face, repeatedly.

Rene has brain damage from his time in a concentration camp. Rather than portray him sympathetically, the narrative treats him as a lost cause. Poor Rene physically attacks Sarah, has multiple collapses, is arrested for attempted murder, and has serious PTSD. But ultimately, all this is meaningless. The viewers know he's going to die so George and Sarah can get together, because that is exactly the kind of show this is. We have a Holocaust survivor with PTSD and brain damage, and he's treated as the hypotenuse in a love triangle, as well as a dead weight who's ruining his saintly wife's life. That is just sick.

In the last episode I watched, George cements his position as a selfish, loathsome, whiny idiot. George actually asks Sarah to marry him, raise her child with him (yeah, she's pregnant with George's kid. Shocker!), and throw her husband into a nursing home. When she refuses, he whines, quits his political career out of petulance, and starts drinking heavily. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen! Oh, and he has daddy issues now too, which the show REALLY wants us to sympathize with. Again, forget the Holocaust survivor: we have a rich Protestant man with DADDY ISSUES! Feel sorry for him, dammit! FEEL SORRY FOR HIM!

Season 2 relied heavily on torture porn to keep its ratings up. James tried to cure himself of his gayness, and we were treated to horrible scenes of him undergoing electroshock therapy at the hands of a psychotic ""doctor"". Just how gay-friendly can a show claim to be when it seems to revel in its gay character being TORTURED for several episodes? Meanwhile, Olivia just cried and moped around. Eventually, the torture of James did end, thanks to Andrew Swanson's help. But then Olivia's baby died, she bought a motherless baby to replace it (!), and then started a torrid affair with an artist--just months after her husband got back from being tortured. It's like they were trying to make her look like the most selfish, horrible person in existence.

By the way, while Olivia loses her baby, Sarah almost miscarries, but she and the baby are saved. So Mary Sue gets to keep her baby, but Olivia doesn't. Way to abuse your own characters, A Place to Call Home. And just what is this show's obsession with babies and motherhood? It's practically a fetish at this point. We have Sarah having past angst over miscarrying in the concentration camp and being unable to carry a child to term (which the writers just made up for this season), Sarah having prophetic-looking dreams about babies and children, Olivia going into hysterics whenever baby Georgie is at risk, Rose the maid, who's obsessed with the loss of her own baby and tries to steal Georgie, the subplot about the pregnant teen dying in childbirth--babies, babies, babies. Practically all the women on this show are obsessed with motherhood. And this show is supposed to be progressive?

Gino and Anna's marriage is falling apart, which any reasonable person could have predicted. But of course, Gino is portrayed as the bad guy for--are you ready for this?--expecting Anna to do her fair share of farm work! The horror! Why, it's almost like rich women have to WORK when they marry poor men! Poor Anna just doesn't have time to work on her novel--yeah, she's into writing now. I don't even know. And judging from the passages that have been read aloud to us, it sounds awful. But I'm guessing this show will treat Anna as a natural genius and her novel as the best work of literature since War and Peace. Because again: that's just the kind of show this is.

But what really put the nail in this show's coffin for me? When the writers decided to punish Caroline for being a modern, progressive woman with a career. By having her raped. By the buffoonish political hack/newspaper tycoon. To add insult to injury, they made Caroline look stupid for meeting with the guy in the first place, because Jack actually WARNS her about him. And before the rape happens, Jack catches Caroline and the guy drinking together and storms off in a jealous rage without even asking for an explanation. And I am willing to bet the show will victim-blame Catherine and focus on Jack's angst.

I told you this show was sick, didn't I? Anyone complaining about the political correctness/liberal values of this show? You've got nothing to worry about. The writers punish everyone who steps out of their place, everyone who's not white, Anglo-Saxon,Protestant, and straight, and every woman who dares work outside the home or who isn't obsessed with having babies. Even Sarah is only a Jewish convert, and I'm guessing the show will have her convert back to Christianity when Rene conveniently dies and she marries George.

I've heard of good TV shows declining in quality as they stretch out over multiple seasons, but this show was already awful in Season 1, so I thought it would just be more cliched crap. Instead, it hits rock bottom and digs even deeper. There are no depths to which this show won't sink to get ratings or heap ridiculous tragedy on its characters' heads. It's not going to improve, it's not going to suddenly change its tone or its approach, and I damn well should have known better.",1529712000,,6243,4.7456221198156685
