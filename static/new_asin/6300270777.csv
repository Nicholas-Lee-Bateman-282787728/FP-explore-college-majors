7808322,5,6300270777,"Showcasing eight Warner Brothers gems, ""A Salute to Chuck Jones"" (1990) remains the finest collection of this influential animator's work.  Landmark shorts include: ""Duck Dodgers in the 24th Century"" (1953), pitting Daffy Duck against Marvin Martian for the domination of Planet X; Elmer Fudd's pursuit of Bugs Bunny amidst Maurice Noble's striking backgrounds in ""What's Opera, Doc?"" (1957); the timeless ""One Froggy Afternoon"" (1955); and the Road Runner classic ""Zoom and Bored"" (1957). The only caveat is the omission of ""Duck Amuck""   no Jones retrospective would be complete without this 1953 tour de force. Running nearly an hour, the out-of-print video is a gold mine for animation buffs.",1338940800,,696,5.425925925925926
7808323,4,6300270777,"Chuck Jones was an animation pioneer. Responsible for creating cartoon characters like Pepe Le Pew, the Road Runner, and Wile E. Coyote, Jones name is synonymous with cartoon animation excellence and the highest quality in his profession. This video collection, containing eight cartoons, was originally released in 1985 as a tribute to this genius in the world of animation.
This video is nearly an hour in length and contains the following cartoons: ""Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 Century"", ""For Scentimental Reasons"", ""One Froggy Evening"", ""Rabbit Seasoning"", ""High Note"", ""Feed the Kitty"", ""Zoom and Bored"", and ""What's Opera Doc?"". The titles may not be familar to some, but the cartoons themselves should be quickly recognizable to most fans of the Looney Tunes. The standouts are ""One Froggy Evening"", ""What's Opera, Doc?"", and ""For Scentimental Reasons"". ""One Froggy Evening"", starring Michigan J. Frog in his only starring role, is a cartoon that many have seen. He stars as the singing frog who only sings in the presence of one person but no one else, causing all sorts of problems for the man who discovers him. ""What's Opera Doc"" stars Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in an opera, with most all of the lines sung by one of the two stars and only a few spoken lines by each. ""For Scentimental Reasons"" stars Pepe Le Pew in his usual role, trying to win the affections of the female cat with the white stripe down her back who resembles a skunk. Its clever lines and surprising scenes helped earn it an Academy Award.
There are two rare cartoons on this video: ""High Note"" and ""Feed the Kitty"". ""High Note"" doesn't include any star characters- the ""stars"" are a bunch of musical notes who are trying to form the music to the ""Blue Danube"", but one musical note is causing problems. ""Feed the Kitty"" stars Marc Antony the dog who falls for the friendship of a small kitten and tries to keep her a secret from his owners.
Just like the other cartoons in this tribute series (there are three of them), there is no interview or segment on the tape dedicated to Chuck Jones. The only tribute is included on the back of the box, where Entertainment Tonight's film critic Leonard Maltin pays his respects to the late Chuck Jones.
Overall, this is a very good video collection of cartoon shorts. It's a difficult video to find, since it is no longer manufactured. But it is worth adding to you video collection if you are a fan of the Looney Tunes or a fan of animation in general.",1086048000,17,2475,4.691954022988506
7808324,5,6300270777,"There are very few animators today that still can endure and showcase a brilliant power in kids today. Most of them have either few companies they look up to, from Tom and Jerry, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny. Of all those animators that conjured up creative characters, nobody has done it better than the late, great Chuck Jones.
When people behind the scenes pass on, Warner Brothers would sell portraits reflecting their legacies, from Speechless for Mel Blanc, who died in 1989, and Don Messick, who did the voice of Scooby-Doo, who passed on in 2001. Surprisingly, that wasn't the case for Chuck Jones. After Warner Brothers shut down their chain of studio stores, they were unable to accomplish that portrait to hang on the shelves for Chuck Jones, instead they re-released a few videos for his legacy.
The 2002 re-release of A Salute To Chuck Jones, is a fantastic retrospective of his creativity and feel for the characters he was a fanatic towards, like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. The video is as crisp and exciting as if it was originally released back in 1985, from Warner Brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection. This is the first time any of the videos from the Golden Jubilee collection was reissued, since 1990.
The cartoons are just as exciting and strong, with features like What's Opera Doc?, One Froggy Evening with one-toon wonder Michigan J. Frog, who became the mascot for the WB network in 1995, and Chuck's only Academy Award winning cartoon for Warner Brothers, For Scent-imental Reasons with Pepe Le Pew.
Although Chuck Jones passed on, his cartoons have made him immortal for years on, and remains as the whole truth on. He was 89 years old.

7808325,4,6300270777,"A SALUTE TO CHUCK JONES is a great tape from Warner Brothers' 24 Karat Gold Collection. Sadly, Chuck Jones passed away on February 22, 2002. He was a great animator. This collection includes all of his best cartoons. DUCK DODGERS IN THE 24TH AND 1/2 CENTURY (1953) is one of Daffy Duck and Porky Pig's best. ONE FROGGY EVENING (1955) is certainly a classic cartoon. One of the best remembered cartoons. RABBIT SEASONING (1953) is a great Elmer Fudd/Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck cartoon. HIGH NOTE (1960) includes little dialogue but is very funny. ZOOM AND BORED (1957) has some very original ideas and gags. This is the only Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote cartoon on this tape. Too bad, because those are his best characters. I'd say this tape is great for any Chuck Jones fan. I recommed this. Goodbye, Chuck Jones.",1018310400,13,810,4.711267605633803
