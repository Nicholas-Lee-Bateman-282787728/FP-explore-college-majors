6998639,4,B00SZZZSMM,"interesting movie! very timely. Being a Troma release I was not expecting but the usual campy stuff, but this is a low budget film with a very modern tone. I'll leave it at that. I liked it.",1469059200,4,190,4.162162162162162

6998643,1,B00SZZZSMM,"Really bad, low budget exploitation flick. Proof that you cannot make ""cult"" movies deliberately. I'd give it ZERO stars if it were possible.",1473033600,,141,5.173913043478261

6998646,1,B00SZZZSMM,"Suckered in by thinking somebody might have made a film with a different story about the Manson Family, I just watched the worse movie ever made.  Who thinks filming maggots on a human corpse is something people want to watch?  There is nothing interesting about this movie, just gross out scenes.",1470787200,,297,4.803921568627451
6998647,5,B00SZZZSMM,"Honky H. was made in America the greatest Nation in the whole world, people who make movies like this are free to make movies like this in America, the greatest place in the whole gosh darn world.

6998648,4,B00SZZZSMM,"t's Troma, it's obviously crap.

Maybe someone else has done it before, but reversing the power structure between whites and blacks was powerful and educational and exposed the ridiculousness of both sides.

This is a significant political movie, unfortunately it's wrapped in the Troma sandwhich.

I think the scene where the blacks are called (n-words, so I can actually post this-- bizarre) and they laugh is worth watching this movie.

It does get pretty incoherent after that.",1469664000,2,481,5.207792207792208
6998649,1,B00SZZZSMM,Garbage. Hateful sadistic film. Worse Troma movie I've ever seen.,1469404800,6,65,5.6
8700029,2,B00SZZZSMM,"I'm only giving it 2 stars cause they tried to send a message about racism. The idea was really great, but the movie turned out like garbage. As a lover of cinema I can't support this product. I'm all about controversial films on race. I love grindhouse, but this film falls very, very short. It's like the filmmaker didn't even care about the acting quality of this film. The actors that were killed on screen didn't even react the proper way. Just emotionless, LOL. And orange blood??? They could have easily purchased red movie blood. The reviewers saying that this is the 'greatest film on race"" is an insult to great racially-charged movies. They must be friends of the filmmaker to tell that ""LIE"".  Now....if they were trying to make a trash film on purpose, then they did a good job on that end. If you wanna get drunk and have a laugh on a bad movie night with friends, then this film is perfect for that.",1534723200,,914,4.473053892215569
8700030,4,B00SZZZSMM,"""The obscenities in Honky Holocaust mingle regrettably well with storys racial social inequalities in a chaotic melee, pointing out the senseless violence and asinine nature in social jest. Paul McAlarney knew what he was creating from within the belly of the beast of his darkest comedy, even if the punk paraders LSD-inspired trip through hell seems misconstrued on the surface.""

8700031,5,B00SZZZSMM,"Very cool low budget film with a lot on it's mind. It's a bit of a thought experiment/sleazy art piece that creates a world in which blacks are the dominant group and whites get treated like second class citizens. It's not a subtle film but I like my politics straight, no chaser-so I appreciated that it really 'went for it' (i.e. the cop characters). Watch it in honor of black history month. It's like a sociology class with extra humor, gore and nudity. If you don't enjoy grindhouse type films or if you voted for Trump, you should probably steer clear of this one. I enjoyed it thoroughly...it even featured a crucifixion !!!",1486425600,,631,4.592920353982301
8700032,5,B00SZZZSMM,Perhaps the best movie I've ever seen in my life. You get all the usual Troma genius vibes but with a deeply complex and moving story. I got this for my best friend for his birthday and can't wait to see what he thinks!!! I love this movie!!!,1485907200,,242,4.0625

8700036,4,B00SZZZSMM,"I kid of course when I say that but legitimately it's a trip, man! Distributed my Troma Entertainment (known for releasing such lurid pictures like Blood-Sucking Freaks aka The Incredible Torture Show, Killer Condom, Rabid Grannies, The Toxic Avenger, Class of Nuke Em High and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, just to name a few) comes Honky Holocaust a film that was proclaimed by head of Troma Lloyd Kaufman to be the best film he had seen in the past 40 years and I kinda have to agree. In the last (about) 10 years I had not seen an exploitation film this unique, original, thought-provoking and soulful and yet at the same time trashy, stupid, offensive and gross since Kaufman's own Poultrygeist. The plot is as follows: Charles Manson was right! The Beatles did tell him of a great race war with their song Helter Skelter. And by committing the Tate/LaBianca murders Manson and his followers hid in a bunker in the woods waiting for Helter Skelter to end so they may rise up and rule the world. The thing is Manson was wrong about something though, the world they enter is a world ruled by African-Americans. What follows is gross, gory, stupid, cheap, foul mouthed and kinda genius. Really everything in this movie is BAD I mean worse than you could possibly imagine (Unless you watch bad movies on a regular basis and have seen literally thousands, like me, then this might be not that bad but I am writing this segment from the perspective of someone who might not be familiar with the low budget exploitation genre), that level of bad on a serious critical level this is something that would make Ebert walk out of the theater within the first few seconds. But since I love bad horror and exploitation films this did not bother me in the slightest in fact the low budget added to the surreal nature of the film and its serious themes at least in my opinion. Overall it's an interesting premise done on a super low budget. The film's use of the creative premise, some really off the wall dialogue and scenes and the creative use of very cheap effects make it all worthwhile especially if you love weird hippie exploitation or blaxploitation films like An American Hippie in Israel or Fight for Your Life. Or if you love terrible low budget splatter films like Pemutos: Lord of the Living Dead, Violent Sh! t and Black Past. It is possibly the best movie about racism since American History X. 4.5/5",1483488000,2,2417,4.636363636363637

8700038,5,B00SZZZSMM,"A movie that finally asks the age old question ""what if Charlie Manson succeeded ?"". Much like the high concept drama ""The Man In The High Castle"" only with lots of dicks.",1483488000,,171,4.375
