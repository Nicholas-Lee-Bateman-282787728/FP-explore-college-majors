4114077,5,B003EHZJQQ,"Although the Statlers are not my favorite gospel quartet, I enjoy watching them.  And most importantly, this collection of gospel favorites comes from the Statler Brothers Show which successfully ran on TNN for seven years.  While the show was running, I watched it often, but to my regret, I never really paid attention to the gospel section at the end of the show.  The show incorporated 40 & 50s, country, folk, and of course the gospel songs.

What a surprise to hear one of my favorite spirituals, ""I Shall Not Be Moved"".  This upbeat and defiant folk song dates back to the slave era.  Johnny Cash has one of the most popular versions.

The Statlers discuss with Bill Gaither, how they came to become with Johnny Cash and sing on his show for several years.  They share their deep friendship within each other.  You will learn the respect the latest member, Jimmy has for the other three Statlers.

They share information about what their children and grandchildren's involvement in music.  The name for the group was derived from a box of tissues, called Statler Tissues.

Another important friendship and love is the for The Cathedrals and you will see a piece of that,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cathedrals-A-Farewell-Celebration/dp/B00021XI60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cathedrals: A Farewell Celebration</a>.

One of the Statlers popular gospel songs is Stuart Hamblin's ""The Ole House"".  A beautiful song that closes the DVD is ""Precious Memories"" when they discuss having good memories.

Some great songs include:  Leaning on the Everlasting Arms; Sweet By and Bye; Daddy Sang Bass, The King is Coming; Eye is on the Sparrow; Little is Much, etc. etc.

This is a Bill Gaither Tribute to a legendary gospel group, The Statler Brothers.  There is a lot of great classic music.  Rizzo",1289692800,9,1850,5.273972602739726

8395515,3,B003EHZJQQ,"Dude - this is a DVD! A nice perk if you listen to your music ON THE TELEVISION! It has the lyrics and background info, but I cannot listen to it in the car. I tried to save it to my iTunes account so that I could get around the DVD issue, but apparently there's a lot of cheaters who don't purchase the items they put on their iTunes, so they make it super difficult to do. Add to that the fact that I am not IT-savvy, and you see the problem.
I'm sure the DVD is great (because  the Statler Brothers are great), but it will be a while before I can find out for sure. CD/DVD buyer beware!",1459123200,,589,3.908333333333333
