5198025,5,B008Z699NU,"Just a wonderful, old fashion, family movie! It is a double feature, as described, on one disc.  I did not read carefully the description, however, and it is not the actors I was expecting. Still good tho! This was a ""used"" DVD, (paid 50 cents + very reasonable s&h) but you would never know it! It was in new condition, case and all. Thanks!",1428451200,3,342,4.34375

8532963,3,B008Z699NU,Great classic movie.  BUT!  Very poor quality recording.  It was twice as clear when watched on Netflix.  In places it looked like someone stuck a recorder up to an old TV and recorded it off the screen.  Noise and streaks abound.,1465516800,2,230,4.512195121951219

8532965,5,B008Z699NU,"Great movie for family viewing. The boy's determination to work and get money to buy his own hunting dogs is something you do not see from children today. He not only worked to buy his dogs, but also made extra to buy something for each member of his family. Ending was sad. That is the only part I don't like.",1455926400,,310,4.183333333333334
