8018433,4,B0001YYNXA,"These Disney VHS cartoons were released in the 1980s, and I fondly remember renting the series many times from the local video shop.  This particular tape is focused on Pluto and his exploits with the Disney gang. An excellent collection, which hopefully Disney will release on DVD along with others in the Cartoon Classics series. Until then, look for used VHS tapes in the Amazon Marketplace and auction sites.",1147478400,3,412,4.971014492753623
