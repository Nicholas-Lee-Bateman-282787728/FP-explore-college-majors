2714187,5,B000LV6OBM,"This is a great DVD and the awards are well deserved.  Though John Trudell was considered a threat for only talking, it shows how talking can be a threat to those doing wrong, and self protection must always be used by people only talking.  Johns family was in danger because he never realized that talking was dangerous.  Let this be a warning to others speaking truth to power, so that they protect their families as if they were in an armed struggle.  Great DVD.  This should be studied in schools.",1254960000,,501,4.522222222222222
2714188,5,B000LV6OBM,"John Trudell will make you see things in a completely different light.  Although I cried through a lot of Trudell, I came away feeling enlightened.  His decades long struggle for the American Indian people is a testament to his passion and bravery.  I would highly recommend this to anyone willing to search their own soul and find it lacking.",1254096000,2,343,4.779661016949152
2714189,5,B000LV6OBM,"Authentic! Trudell is one of the most important films I've seen in my lifetime.  It is a powerful and clear wake up call to humanity.  Where is all this ""progress"" going?  Why are we in such a hurry to keep ""The Great Machine"" wheels turning?  Trudell is a reminder of who we are and where this whole rat race is taking us.  This man is a living example of responsiblity and clarity.  Johnn Trudell is an activist/artist who will be remembered as one of the leaders for the good future. Buy it, share it, talk about it.",1180742400,14,519,4.298969072164948
2714190,5,B000LV6OBM,"John Trudell is a force of nature.  His words carry a resonance that vibrates within us all.  He sees through the machine humanity is locked into, and he has the brass cajones to say out loud what our souls are screaming just below the surface of the lock step mind set we are all sold into by corporate media.

See this brilliant film.  It should be required viewing for every American history class in America.  John Trudell stands among the great Americans.  If we incorporated his visions into our social plans, the world would be a place we could all begin to find joy in again.

2714191,3,B000LV6OBM,"The above sentence is from the extensive FBI file (one of the longest in their possession!) about Native American activist John Trudell and speaks volumes. While not as charismatic as leaders like Russel Means and Dennis Banks, John Trudell has become ""the voice"" of Native American resistance.
Filmmaker and Cherokee Indian Heather Ray met Trudell when she graduated from the Film Academy. She then picked up the plan to make a documentary about Trudell. 12 years later the project was finished. After being shown at festivals for a year the film is now available on DVD. The film lasts 78 minutes, the extra's 30. This is an all region DVD.

The documentary tells John Trudell's life story. Born of Lakota and Mexican parentage, Trudell was drawn into the newly emerging Native consciousness and partook in actions like the occupation of the former penitentiary Alcatraz and the occupation of the BIA building in 1972. In 1979 Trudell burnt an American flag before the building of the FBI in Washington DC. A few hours later the house of Trudell's mother in law was set on fire. His mother in law, his pregnant wife and his three children perished in the flames. Nobody was ever sentenced for this crime. This meant the end of Trudell the activist, but the birth of the poet/songwriter. In 1993 Trudell's first CD, the highly acclaimed AKA Graffiti Man, was released. Later Trudell turned to acting and starred in several movies, including Thunderheart and Dreamkeeper.

The picture quality of the DVD is excellent and the historical images of the much talked about actions of the Indian resistance in the 70s fascinating. Most fascinating, however, are the words, sometimes in the form of poems, of this complex personality and his vision of our Western Society. Filmmakers, other musicians and band members also contribute. The reason that I gave this DVD ""only"" three stars is that Trudell's words dominate so strongly that too little documentary remains. I also was not very impressed with the quality of the 13 minutes of live material of a concert by Trudell and his band. It looked more like something that was shot by an amateur in the public. The film maker missed out on a big chance here.

My conclusion: this is a good documentary that could have been better. For those interested in contemporary Native American Resistance it will be well worth the money.",1170115200,30,2370,4.905236907730673

2714201,4,B000LV6OBM,"In order for one to truly experience Art and Exile, one must suffer a great deal of pain or imagine what pain feels like for someone else, this is to captivate something as beautiful as art. In the documentary film Trudell it deals with a story from a man raised in Nebraska and how his life is today as a musician and a poet. These two arts can be easy for people to relate to if they can tell that it is something that is coming from the heart of the creator. Trudell dealt with his mother's death at an early age, 6 years old, and his journey to go to the navy, Vietnam, and then to getting stationed. These are life experiences that one must feel heartbroken and live in fear because having your mother die at such an early changes the rest of your life and the fear of finding a void in that whole. However, he was able to be supportive and love his children when he grew up even though all the hardships that he faced when he was a child and growing up. This movie teaches audience members through his narration and close-up on how to be a better person even when life smacks you with pain. The documentary style that the film director, Heather Rae, portrayed was so that the audience can feel as if they are living through the experience of what it takes to be a great artist. Also, what Rae did in such a timely fashion was that she brought up the subject of war into a country who just faced terrorist attack in 2001, and this film brings light to someone who went through war earlier. The film debuted in 2005 at Sundance film festival and it released a year later in the United States, early enough for audience members to still remember the aftermath of the terrorist attack.",1397779200,,1687,4.29153605015674

Now named something different and more globally expanded to stop anyone who is raising the population's consciousness of the truth on how  the Corporate Colonialistic Machinery pillages and denatures Motherlife.  Those who do care for her, for all of our interconnected and especially creative well being need poetic inspiration such as is found in Trudell!",1372896000,2,620,5.316326530612245
2714208,5,B000LV6OBM,"This is a documentary that tells the life of John Trudell, a Native American activist and member of the American Indian Movement.  Trudell basically says that those who have lost, or never attained, a spiritual relationship with the land and the people are trapped in a materialistic power struggle with themselves and each other and the world around them, and that it's self-destructive.  The film shows the paranoia that people like him awake in the federal government, and it comes across almost like slapstick in places.  This struck me as I was watching it because some of the clips of conflicts with the federal government are old and have the kind of jerky motion you see in old movies and home movies from the 50s. I don't think the filmmakers intended to create this effect but it's there and it reinforces the commentary Trudell is making. He's basically saying that they are not in tune with the natural world and the way the film moves provides an almost robotic sense of motion, like in battle scenes with the cavalry.  The government is presented as a force that is so fearful of exposure that it will attack and attempt to destroy the spiritual center of those who see how really empty, confused and ""battery-powered"" it is, and that the society that created it is.  People like Trudell are perceived as dangerous by those who need to exercise power over others in order to help themselves not become cognizant of their own inner deadness. So he's making some very powerful statements and comparisons between the way Native Americans live in harmony with the world around them and how the dominant culture basically seeks its sense of ""life"" in a materialistic world that has no real center.  He's very perceptive in some ways, but not entirely.  For example, his take on Columbus Day is very stereotypical and one-sided and shows that he really doesn't understand why Columbus means as much as he does to Italian-Americans or to Americans in general.  So in that argument he falls short of the ideals he professes to have and to represent.  The other thing that struck me as somewhat hypocritical of him was how often in the clips he was shown smoking while he's talking about how white people pollute the planet and make people sick with their poisons, and here he is smoking the white man's cigarette poisoning his lungs.  So I found that kind of inconsistent with the philosophy of life he was advocating. But I definitely recommend this dvd as it's thought provoking and Trudell has a lot of powerful insights to offer, though how the viewer chooses to interpret them in the context of his behavior might be another story.",1351641600,,2642,4.761487964989059
2714209,5,B000LV6OBM,"It's not the kind of story anyone loves. I gave the film 5 stars not because I loved it, but because it's so important. Corruption, crime, and the ruthless misuse of power are not new in the story of the federal government's dealings with Native people, but this account brings history out of the past into our own day.

John Trudell has been a political activist most of his life. He is not guilty of any crime, but he has  exercised his constitutional right to freedom of speech. He has advocated for fair treatment of his people - an issue one would not expect to be controversial in The Land of the Free. He says, ""All I ever did was talk,"" but that seems to have been enough for the FBI to regard him as extremely dangerous. John's pregnant wife, their children, and his mother-in-law were murdered in an arson fire. Trudell is presumed to have been the prime target, but he happened to be out of town when the fire was set. The murders remain unsolved, but the FBI looks very suspect in this chillingly compelling documentary.",1351036800,5,1032,4.48404255319149

2714211,2,B000LV6OBM,"I was really dismayed by the reactionary rhetoric of those days (Means et al wanting to go back to the buffalo) - I wondered where it came from and who they claimed to represent.  Did anything positive ever come of it all?  The culmination was when Trudell (a navy veteran) burned the American Flag on national TV and within 12 hours several of his family members were killed in a house fire at Duck Lake, NV.  What did he expect in those violent times?  Didn't he realize the price he would have to pay?  I was reminded of an impulsive little kid playing with a dangerous loaded weapon.  Go to any country and burn their flag on national TV and see what happens!  Nowhere in this movie did I hear him take any direct or indirect personal responsibility for what happened to his family, but only to blame others.  Hopefully, our youth of today have learned that your behavior is a function of its consequences and to take personal responsibility for your actions!",1285027200,,963,4.526011560693641

As a Micmac Indian, the only thing I'm saddened by and disappointed by regarding the documentary, was Heather Rae and other conjurers of this documentary's failings to mention the death of Anna Mae Aquash. During their AIM movement, this woman left two children to be a leader and a warrior woman for their cause. She was murdered by the hands of AIM. She was a close friend of John's, and for her sacrifices to his movement, she was unjustly murdered, representing all the things John took issue with, discussed in this documentary.  Never once did he mention or did Heather Rae pay honor and respect of the Micmac people, or Anna's two daughters who suffer the same pain John did loosing his family to violence, only it was AIM's hands with the blood on it. Not even a single word about his dear friend, Anna. I know this was Heather Rae's and other's doings, to leave this loss of Anna out of this documentary.",1501372800,,1071,4.538860103626943
