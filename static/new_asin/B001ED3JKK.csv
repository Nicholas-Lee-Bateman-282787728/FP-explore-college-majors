Picture quality and sound were just as good in DVD and often even better, believe it or not? Now I am waiting for many titles to be formatted also on DVD. Next I'll be replacing my VHS videos of Richard Roundtree, Fred Williamson and other African-American action heroes of the early 1970s. Oscar Micheaux and Spencer Williams produced most of the African-American films from 1920 up to the mid-1940s. But! Fifteen DVDs for such a low price, no way you can lose of such a deal! I have never ever had a faulty VHS videotape nor DVD from Amazon, they set the standards others wish they could follow and deliver upon, they are NUMBER ONE!",1422921600,4,793,4.591549295774648
8297867,5,B001ED3JKK,"This colletion of early Black films is a rare look at the outstanding contributions made by African American artists in the earler times of American history.

It showcases some of the outstanding talent that went unsunged during a time when ex[posue to black culturse was at a minimun.

While some of the films show siginificant wear over time, the overall effect of the presentaions are truly Classic.",1365638400,6,402,4.985074626865671

This was a Christmas gift which when I purchased I forgot to change the address to have the package mailed to my husband at his address in NY where we were for the holidays. Well no one could change the address and so the package came to my home in Texas where it stayed in the garage until we were together again in February. We randomly picked a DVD and placed in in the player. The quality looks like it was dubbed many times over. If that is not the case and the apparent quality is how it is suppose to be, I say to anyone considering purchasing the collection, make an investment you would be really happy with.  You will not be very satisfied with the picture and sound quality of this collection. I am not bashing nor badmouthing just stating the facts.",1360886400,9,986,4.24468085106383
