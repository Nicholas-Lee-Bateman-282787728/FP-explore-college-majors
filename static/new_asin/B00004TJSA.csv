1350612,4,B00004TJSA,"Plot Summary: The Z warriors enjoy a few moments of relative peace on Earth when they suddenly sense an incredible ki approaching - Frieza and his father, King Cold! Goku still has not returned, and tension begins to  mount as the ship draws steadily closer. Just when it seems that our heroes  are about to be crushed, a mysterious young warrior leaps into action, and  easily dispatches most of the enemy warriors, then squares off against  Frieza and his father, and he has a surprise for them...
Comments: The  larger part of this tape exists mainly to set the scene and provide some  comic relief, but the battle scenes and appearance of Trunks are both very  enjoyable. Surprisingly, the actor chosen to play the voice of Trunks  actually seems to fit, which is a welcome turn from some of the other voice  actors in English DBZ. Even more appreciated is the face that there is very  little mangling of the original Japanese dialog, which is another occurance  that is all-too-common in the English dubs. Overall, a great addition to  your collection.",963187200,,1057,4.779005524861878

Frieza and his father, King Cold, land and are set on  destroying everything. All of a sudden, Trunks shows up and the battle  begins. This is a great tape and shouldn't be missed, but also get the next  tape, Prelude to Terror, to see what happens after the cliffhanger at the  end of this tape.",961459200,7,461,4.4523809523809526

This volume proves it as he's  not terrified by Frieza in the least.  Especially if you like to see people cut into little floating pieces, or just seeing how cocky and adorable little  ol frieza and his daddy are, this is the perfect volume to add to your DBZ  collection, and it's making mine all the merryier!  If you LOVE Trunks,  this volume is for you!  Go Purple!",961286400,,480,4.292134831460674
1350617,5,B00004TJSA,"When i saw on amazon.com that Trunks was comming out, Iimmediatly reserved  a copy. Once I had reserved it, my body filled with jitters. It was so  amazing. The day it came to my house, It was in the vcr 38 seconds after it  came in the door. I give the tape 5 stars for these reasons: Anime: 5 star  worthy, some mistakes but thats okay because its just a ""cartoon""  Action: 5 stars without a doubt. Extremely good. The fighting mainly takes  place at the beginning of this tape Music: 5 stars-Excellent. The music  sets the mood. It wouldnt be as good without the music. Plot: 5 stars.  Realistic and fun. You wanna keep watching. Adrenaline: 5 stars- This'll  get your blood flowing from head to toe. The plot goes as follows: After  fighting with Frieza, the mysterious Super Saiyan goes at it with Frieza's  dad, King Cold. Shortly after, our original hero from the beginning, Goku,  arrives yet, the young one predicted exactly where and when Goku would  arrive. How could that be? Goku and the young kid talk about whats gonna  happen because Goku realizes that this person is from the future. After  realizing about destiny, which you'de have to watch to enjoy, Goku starts  his training once again. I strongly suggest that you buy this video. Beyond  wonderful. It Kicks!",961200000,,1280,4.642857142857143
1350618,5,B00004TJSA,"The Trunks series is basically to show how strong Goku is because....well, let's say that Trunks can't even touch Goku.  AWESOME SAGA!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! THIS IS WHEN IT GETS REALLY GOOD!  GO AND GET THEM  BOTH!",960508800,4,213,4.833333333333333
1350619,5,B00004TJSA,"For all of your DBZ lovers, this is the begginning when the series gets good. If you think frieza was cool which was episode 100. You will be suprised to know that there are 289 episodes of dbz and 78 episodes of  Dragon Ball Grand tour:a series when the Z team is all old. There is  trunks, Bulma and Vegitas son, goten, Gokus and chi chis son. Who are both  super say-jinns with out even training. Gohon is 14 and going to  highschool. they fight amazing battles. This is not a review for this  video, but just telling you how it start. this actual video is when trunks  comes from teh futer to warn goku that he has to train because dr gero  creates two very strong androids. To test gokus skill Trunks fights him  with a sword. Goku only uses two of his fingers. This is the beginning to  where the whole thing gets good.",959990400,4,825,4.237179487179487

1350641,5,B00004TJSA,"If you like Trunks, this DVD makes him look like a god!  There's a really good song in the Japanese version for when Trunks turns Super Saiyan in front of Frieza.  There isn't much action in the first episode and a half, but the other half makes up for it.",1006387200,,256,4.1
1350642,5,B00004TJSA,"Trunks: Mysterious Youth is an awesome and hilarious video. Vegeta forced to wear PINK!!! I'm still laughing! It was great to finally get to see King Cold, I've wanted to see his episodes for a long time, and he was awesome, (and funny!}, with his running criticism of Frieza and his haughty, imperial manner. And Chi-Chi attacking the Tutor of Terror was priceless. Yamcha's jealousy of Bulma and Vegeta,[what in HFIL was Bulma thinking!], and Bulma leading Vegeta around like a lost puppy, HAH! Another great video! Of course, this also marked the first appearance of Trunks, and boy, did he make a entrance! Frieza never stood a chance! Too bad about King Cold though... I liked him. He didn't get much of a showing, not enough, in my opinion. Other than that, this video rocks!",1004400000,,781,4.75
1350643,4,B00004TJSA,"Having just seen the Frieza saga and REALLY wanting to know what happened to Goku (he's my favorite character), I was eagerly awaiting these episodes. While I waited, I saw the Garlic Junior saga... oh boy, what a disappointment. That saga is pretty bad. So are these next episodes a blessing, or just another disappointment? Let's find out.
The story starts off a little slow and silly with the first episode, but it's got some good laughs in it worthy of mentioning. Vegeta's new t-shirt for one thing has to be seen to be believed! ^_^ The first episode ends in a typical DBZ way; we see Frieza and his father approaching Earth. The next episode is a lot different from the first, it's very serious and tense. I remember my stomach churning as the Z Warriors prepared to face Frieza. And then, we are treated to the introduction of a really neat new character: Trunks. Of course, at this point, we have no clue who he is. But I found myself instantly start to like him as he shows off his powers and attacks Frieza... with style!
In the cut version of the third episode, people are left hanging because they want to know if Frieza survived... well, in the uncut version, we pretty much know the answer to that. ;)
I really enjoyed these episodes, and I can't wait for the next volume.",1001808000,,1287,4.480851063829787
1350644,4,B00004TJSA,"i rated it 4 stars because it could have fit 1 more episode here is where we meet trunks and cyborg freeza along with his father king kold we also find out trunks can go super saiyan. but i thought goku,vegeta, and gohan where the only saiyans left. get's you wondering doesn't it",992736000,,280,4.30188679245283
1350645,5,B00004TJSA,"Well, Dragon Ball Z is not an Anime for children, it is true we may include all people ages to see this Anime, but we must see it in a different way. We must feel it, see it, hear it, sense it ... DBZ takes us to the deepest of our imagination. We must be able to aprecciate from every point ouf view -- Soundtracks, Animations, Originality, Imagination, The Perfect Atmoshpere --that it transmits us !
This DVD can show us some of that magic potion ! :) The Japanese Version is the true Dragon Ball Z, it's unique !! The voices, the sounds, the musics ! The image is very good considering the DBZ age, only the sound could be in 5.1 ... but, that wouldn't be the original ! :) The English Version in some aspects does not deserve commentaries, the english soundtrack is very bad ! that's not DBZ ! That's some of the american cartoons BGM music ! DDDUUUHHHH ! Truely not good ! The only thing that is worth are the characters voices, they are +/- good but ok ... Well we also have some Extras ! A 20 minute Recap of all the DBZ history till the episodes in this DVD ... as well as some commercials of some DBZ Sagas in VHS, Toys, and the Official DBZ site ! :) ... The Menu is +/- animated but overall this DVD is worth ... because it has that magic potion I talked to you a little while ago ... :) Specially in the Japanese Version !  This DVD has 3 Episodes, from the arrival of Freeza on Earth till Trunks slicing him in Half ! Enjoy ! :)
Well, hope this review has helped you, and sorry if it was too long. But DBZ deserves this and a lot more ... it was ... it is ... and it will always be part of my life ... and GRAB this idea ... Dragon Ball Z is not a cartoon for children who watch TV when they come home from school ... ... ... ... ... it is an Art that shows one thing ! ... Life is worth living it !
Bye everyone ! :)",990316800,,1831,3.9353099730458223
1350646,2,B00004TJSA,"Out of all of the previous customer infos, I don't understand why they think this film is so good.  I have been a dragon ball fan since i was 8 years old and that was thirteen years ago, not too long after the series first started.  I have seen almost all of the episodes and movies and this movie is aweful. It is so short, and not worth wasting 17 or 18 dollars on. Although it is important to understand Trunks past, the movie could have been made so much better, its like they put no effort into making it. Its like the movie starts and you are waiting for something to happen and nothing really happens except the death of Gohan and Trunks eventual transformation into a supersaiyen. This movie would make Akira Toryi.... sad.  His original dream of DBZ has been fading in quality since the start of the Frieza Saga, and this is no different. The humor is gone the voices are not that good, and the music is just not the same.  I have also seen the Japanese version of Dragon Ball GT and it is no different. The series and movies quickly fade in quality and popularity, which led to its end in 1997, in Japan. Don't expect anything to exciting in the future, althought the cell saga was better then i expected it to be. A suggestion to DBz fans, stick to earlier saga and movies, they show the original enthusiasm that the creator (Akira) intended. And I encourage everyone to protest Funimations policies on editing and subbing dbz, its terrible if you compare the Japanese version to the U.S. version.",982800000,,1508,4.433212996389892
1350647,5,B00004TJSA,"The coolest scene is when Trunks catches Freizas energy ball and say ""Excuse me is this yours"".Trunks is really cool not quite as good as his father but close.",973296000,,159,4.517241379310345
1350648,5,B00004TJSA,"Being that dvd's outsold vhs in Japan last month it seems inevitable that the system of the future is at our fingertips.  Therefore buying the vhs dosen't make sense.  It's only a buck cheeper and only includes one version.  On the dvd you get the unedited and the subtitled.  Now if you add that up it all makes sense, buy this dvd, it feels so good to see a show saying what is supposed to be said, instead of the goofy lines that Funi, tries to squeese in.",972259200,3,459,4.181818181818182
1350649,4,B00004TJSA,"This Dvd is brilliant as well as having both the English and Japanese uncut editions on the disc, it has a brief summary of the story so far, for the new viewer. Plus see Vegita th great prince of the Sayian join forces in his quest for the power of a Super Sayian, Plus Vegita meets his match, and Goku also meets his match, but with the female species.

1350660,5,B00004TJSA,"This volume is definetly the coolest so far. First off let me tell you whats so uncut in each episode:
Freiza's Counterattack: Master Roshi's Porno mag, Gohan bleeding, Vegeta in shower.
Mysterious Youth: Freiza bleeding, choped body parts of Freiza's henchmen.
Another Super Sayian?: Freiza sticking his hand through one of his henchmen, diolague between Vegeta and Bulma and Yamcha, Freiza getting cut in half.
These three epsiodes were really great and although Freiza doesnt make as big an apperance as you had hoped, hes still pretty cool. And did I mention Trunks? The coolest charcter in the whole show?",970358400,,610,5.11

1350662,5,B00004TJSA,I've heard my son talking about this tape and I hear it is really cool.  Frieza is now called Cyborg Frieza along with his father King Cold.  My favorite character is Trunks. If you get any of the Trunks videos then get this one first. It is the bomb.,970099200,,251,4.1020408163265305
1350663,5,B00004TJSA,"Finally you to will believe in the power of the mighty Trunks. The Trunks  saga is the one i've been waiting for and finally it's here on DVD.I have  seen the uncut saga and its sure to please any DBZ fan. With the arrival of  Trunks starts in my opinion the coolest time in DBZ. So Frieza beware, the  next level of super saiyan is here.

1350664,5,B00004TJSA,As far as sagas go this is my second favorite.  Trunks is an awsome addition to the Z team with amazing powers at a young age.  You see him  face off with Freeza and Freeza's father King Cold.  Trunks proves to be an  excellent warrior and shows great skill when fighting.  Best of all he is a  Super Saiyan!,967852800,,308,4.11864406779661
1350665,3,B00004TJSA,"So Funimation decided to release the uncut DragonBallZ DVDs by grouping them into smaller packages. That's the reason why they're releasing the two  Trunks DVDs here with 4 Androids DVDs immediately following.  For those who  know the DragonBall Z saga these DVDs will contain the episodes in which  Trunks (Vejita's son) arrives from the future and becoming a SSJ kills  Freiza and his father before Goku comes back to Earth. Then Trunks will  warn them that a serie of Androids are going to destroy the world and tells  them where and when they will appear. For those who don't know anything  about DBZ but like Japanese Animation then the Cell saga looks like a  mixture of elements taken directly from the Terminator Movies but still  with an original plot and very cool elements. Don't think of it as a  Terminator clone because it's not. Only certain aspects regarding the  Androids and the future in which Trunks lives look like those found in  Terminator movies. Everything else is completely original. Akira Toriyama  (DB/DBZ author) and his team obviously liked Terminator so much that they  wanted to include some elements of it inside DBZ story.  For those who  bought the uncut Ginyu DVDs already let's hope that the subtitles bugs have  been fixed in these new releases from Funimation and that they will start  including the eye-catches and previews as well.  Unfortunately the Japanese  audio is Mono only but I really think that something's wrong with  Funimation master tapes used because in the Ginyu discs there are subtitles  for sentences that can't be heard at all which obviously means that those  sentences are recorded in the missing japanese Right-audio track. Overall  is still a worth buying product for any DBZ fan. The future looks bright  however because TOEI Animation in Japan just recently announced that  they're going to re-master all their 500+ Tv series for DVD release. This  would mean that Funimation will be able to get better master tapes in the  future from TOEI, or so I hope.",967420800,,2022,4.916913946587537
1350666,5,B00004TJSA,"I was so excited to see the preview for the Trunks tapes on the Garlic Jr.  saga. I couldn't wait and I replayed the preview over and over. In my  opinion, this is one of the best DBZ tapes. We see Frieza for the last  time, and we get to meet his father, King Cold. We also get to see the  awesome power of Vegeta's son, Trunks. His entrance could have been better,  but it was great anyhow. Many things are revealed in the next tape about  where Trunks came from and also why he came, but that is all I'm saying. To  wrap this up, *Mysterious Youth* is a must have for DBZ fans.",965260800,2,580,3.991304347826087

7922690,1,B00004TJSA,"When the seven magic dragonballs are brought together, a fire dragon appears and will grant one wish before scattering the balls again. Saiyans are a race of space pirates who can turn into powerful fighting creatures. When the Saiyan Goku was a child on Earth, he was dropped on his head, which caused him to forget his pirating nature and grow up nice. Years of adventure, martial arts training, and even marriage followed. This information and more can be found in the DVD's 20-minute introduction to the world of Dragonball Z, which makes this collection of three adventures good for novices and established fans alike. This collection of three episodes centers around the evil Frieza and his plans to punish Goku, after being beaten in battle, by torturing and killing those he holds most dear. Back at home, Goku's family and friends have no idea what's coming. Goku's son Gohan is struggling with a new disciplinarian of a tutor, while the other Z Fighters deal with the return of Vegeta. With Goku nowhere to be found, everybody senses Frieza's arrival and realize to save the Earth they need to try and do battle with Frieza, even though they know it's a battle they could never win. Then a mysterious presence arrives who may be even more powerful than Frieza and his father King Cold combined. What's so enjoyable about these Dragonball Z episodes is the fact that they play like a high school soap opera, but punctuated with battle scenes. --Andy Spletzer
