8394659,1,B003D3Y6EW,"There is nothing new here for anyone who has studied White Star's Olympic Class ships.  At best this program shouldn't take up more than 5 minutes of air time in the next program on the subject.

 But the program does raise some interesting questions:

1. Who on earth would spend the money for this kind of expedition and not get the proper clearance with the Greek government- meaning 1/4 of the entire expedition had to be called off?  This ""documentary"" sounds more staged than I've come to expect from the History Channel.

2. What can divers do at 400 feet that a remote-controlled mini-sub can't so it was necessary to risk people's lives?

3. As another reviewer has noted: Why isn't RMS/HMHS Britannic pictured on the cover of the DVD?",1472169600,,744,4.676923076923077

8394661,3,B003D3Y6EW,"This documentary concerns the Kohler/Chatterton expedition to the hospital ship Britannic of 1914, lost in the Aegean Sea in 1916. Remarkably, the cover photo on the DVD's case is the wrong Britannic, showing the motorship of the same name, launched in 1929! Surely someone should have caught this before the DVD's release; it implies second-rate researching to the potential buyer.
The program itself has some interesting moments, but seems to be built largely around the difficulties (mostly technical, governmental intransigence or weather-related) the expedition encountered which limited the time available for exploration of the wreck. There's the almost-inevitable ""race against a deadline"" theme underlying the expedition's activities.
There are some fascinating views of Britannic, both interior and exterior, but these often seem to take a back seat to the ""drama(s)"" unfolding topside.
The central question of the expedition -- what caused Britannic to sink despite all the changes made in its structure after Titanic's loss -- is not definitively answered, in my view.
The program is interesting, but one wonders why the program had to be released before an answer was found.",1353974400,2,1187,5.527472527472527
8394662,1,B003D3Y6EW,"WHO EVER MADE THIS VIDEO DOESN'T HAVE THEIR FACTS CORRECT ON WHICH SHIP IS WHOM !

 THE SISTER SHIP OF THE ""TITANIC""  WAS THE(  RMS BRITANNIC ! )  AND YES IT WAS SANK IN LIKE 55 MINUTES!

BUT THE ONE THEY HAVE ""PICTURED"" ON THEIR MOVIE ""COVER""  IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHIP THAT ONLY HAD 2 STUBBY STACKS, AND IN HER LAST DAY SHE  WAS ""SCRAPPED!"" ,

THEREFORE WHAT THEY HAVE MISTAKINGLY PICTURED AS THE RMS BRITANNIC, IS ACTUALLY THE UN-RELATED ( "" HV BRITANNIC!"" )  EVEN A RETARD COULD HAVE NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE IN SHIPS!

THE TRUE RMS BRITANNIC  WAS A ""STEAMER"" LIKE HER SITER TIANIC!  THE ( HV BRITANNIC )  WAS RUN WITH MORE MODERN TECHNOLOGY!

SOMEONE NEEDS TO PUT THE CORRECT  SS= STEAM SHIP RMS BRITANNIC'S PICTURE ON THE MOVIE COVER QUICK! LAME BRAINS",1353628800,,761,4.445255474452555
8394663,3,B003D3Y6EW,"In just looking at the cover for the DVD I'm wondering who did the research for it?  The Britannic was near carbon-copy of the Titanic and yet the picture shows a more modern oil-powered ship with two stacks and not the four that these ships had.  I'm a little disappointed that the History Channel let this obvious blooper slip.  I hesitate to order the DVD because if this was so obviously missed, what else is wrong with the DVD?  I gave it three stars mainly because I have seen previews and wasn't overly impressed.",1328832000,2,520,4.5
8394664,2,B003D3Y6EW,"The Star Line has another ship that sinks four years after the Titanic.  This programs TRIES to explain why.

Titanic fans will love seeing this.  For anyone who asks why could any ship in the past century sink, this is knowledge by which to grow.  However, the program makes it clear that it must tie this sinking to Titanic in order to capture more viewers.  Unlike Titanic, only 30 ppl died, rather than more than 1,000.  Also, the reason for the sinking is more obvious: war, rather than ignorance and classism.

To me, the most exciting part of this documentary happens near the end.  The ancestor of a woman who survived this sinking spoke.  It turns out her aunt was the only person to survive the sinkingS of both Titanic and Britannic.  The victims of this sinking were mangled by the ship's propellors.  Definitely tragic, but quite eye-opening as a viewer.

Like a lot of exploratory documentaries, the program spends a lot of time patting itself on the back about how novel or dangerous the expedition is.  But there are two problems here.  First, the divers must abort their mission before they have footage that viewers could actually see and understand.  More importantly, Greek officials snatched the explorers' permit to search before more conclusive evidence is found.  This reminds me of a doc on the supposed Gomorrah in which Jordanian officials keep a Western TV crew from exploring right as they supposedly found something in the water important.

This work will be pleasant to some.  Still, if you hate when things end before a goal is reached, you may find this doc incredibly frustrating; a downright tease, really.",1323820800,6,1641,4.841726618705036
