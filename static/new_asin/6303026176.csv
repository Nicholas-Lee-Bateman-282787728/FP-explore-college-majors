7837125,5,6303026176,"This is an excellent video of some of the episodes of the l990's hit show, ""Clarissa Explains It All"".  Clarissa is your typical but cool girl-next-door character.  She's not your cookie cutter type like many of the girls in television shows  are today. Her relationship with her very smart and proper brother Ferguson is precious.

I recommend this to adults for nostalgia and children from about eight to thirteen; the ""tween"" set.

With any luck Nickelodeon will release every season of Clarissa on DVD.  I believe there is a market for it.",1244678400,2,543,4.8478260869565215
