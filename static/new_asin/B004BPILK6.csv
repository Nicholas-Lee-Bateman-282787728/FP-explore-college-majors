8422168,5,B004BPILK6,"One of my top ten favorite bands of all time and finally a video release.  Loved this one a lot!!!!!  For any fan of early gothic industrial music, this band stood out and continues to do so without changing that much.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys truly great music.",1422489600,,275,4.46
8422169,3,B004BPILK6,"This is a five star band.....Should have been a 5 star, but this is a terrible ""artistic"" editing job! Songs are great, music, words, singing, costumes etc. But too many Grainy blk/wht shots that are out of focus. The whole vid is fuzzy!!! Said the had many cameras - must have been ""Brownies"". Too bad people spend a lot on home theaters and then this video editing comes along!

It even does not fit the 16 x 9 screen, right shape but black bars all around picture, the quality is about same as YouTube 480P videos, image is fuzzy, they got creative by imposing one band member over another and would have been nice if at least the one in the front was in focus instead of both fuzzy.....etc. etc.

Now, having said that - Great Performance and WORTH THE MONEY just to own. Hate the above review, but now you know, ticks me that in a $25,000.00 room w/120"" screen, 1080P projector and Onkyo 7.1, run by a home theater PC and Mac, ARC SOFT Total Media theater and CyberLinc my viewing does not get much better, yet this is only good on at most 50"" viewing.

Again buy the DVD the band is GREAT, just to see,and the sound is good. Sorry guys but all should know.

Merchant shipped as described and fast - Great!",1341792000,,1211,4.3215859030837
