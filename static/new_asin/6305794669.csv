1078916,5,6305794669,"Shaolin vs lama is one of the best kung fu movies. It has everything you're looking for. Great fights, comedy, good plot. This movie will have you laughing hard. It features a alot of styles, but the main one centers around the technique of shadow boxing, which the lama student learned from the secret manuel he stole from the shoalin monks. This is a classic, and a must have for every kung fu fan. Easily 5 stars!!!",1051315200,,418,4.441558441558442
1078917,3,6305794669,"Brought to you by the same team who brought us another great fighting/bad acting/bad writing non-Shaw Brothers/independently produced martial-arts classic ""The Invincible Kung-Fu Legs"", ""Shaolin vs. Lama"" is a comfortable joy to watch for Hong-Kong kung-fu movie fans.
The fighting, as already stated, is great.  (The villain, who's name escapes me at the moment, executes three kicks in a row from a jump & this is accomplished WITHOUT wires.  You can catch him in another ""Shaolin"" movie, ""The Shaolin Temple Strikes Back."")  The costumes are elaborate & attractive & for that matter, so are the sets.  The acting is bad (but that may be attributed to the bad dubbing.  Maybe if the film was in it's original language, the acting might appear better.)  As for the plot, well....
Basically, it's about a young man who challenges various kung-fu instructors in friendly matches so that he can find someone better than he is to teach him kung-fu.  With the help of a young monk, he finds such a man, an elder monk who, against Buddhist traditions, enjoys eating meat & drinking wine.  This teacher had been betrayed by another student, a villain who is in fact, a Tibetan lama.  In the end, the young man must take revenge against the other student for killing his the elder monk, his teacher!  (That ALWAYS happens in these movies!)
This movie is one of several dozens that followed in the wake of Jet Li's first film, ""The Shaolin Temple"" (1982.)  Besides the obvious ""Shaolin"" plot device, the inclusion of monks who don't act like monks are supposed to (by eating meat & drinking alcohol) are directly taken from Jet Li's movie.
If you want to just sit back, relax, & enjoy a light-hearted ""kick-butt"" film, then ""Shaolin vs. Lama"" is for you.  However, after watching this, I suggest you check out the original ""Shaolin Temple.""  It's still a better film & the fighting, in spite of the great choreography in ""Shaolin vs. Lama"", is still better!  (And the acting & cinematography is actually good, too!)",1028678400,,2007,4.847507331378299
1078918,5,6305794669,"This is definately one of my all time favorite kung fu movies. It has a fantastic blend of great fight scenes, comedy, and standard oldschool kung fu flick cheesyness a la Drunken Master (the origional, not ""Legend of...) or Shaolin Temple. There is some wire-work, but usually not during the fight scenes. The quality of the transfer isn't bad, and it scenery is quite colorful. Some other reviewers commented on there being a lack of origional language/subtitles, but I think the dubing really adds to the overall character of the movie. If you are a martial arts movie fanatic like me, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection. You won't be disappointed.",1022889600,,666,4.850877192982456
1078919,5,6305794669,"This is one of my favorites with allot of fighting, but the DVD is disappointing. They need to release a Widescreen version with original language and not the [bad] English dubbed, or re dub it with better voices!",1020902400,,213,4.631578947368421
1078920,5,6305794669,"This movie is great. The first time I watched it I saw many references from the Wu-tang albums. It was awesome. ""Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin, The special technique of Shadowboxin'!"" Great action great story you couldn't ask for more.",1019779200,,250,4.837209302325581
1078921,5,6305794669,"I bought this movie today, popped it into the DVD player, and enjoyed a good ol' kung fu movie.  The action was fast and furious, the acrobatics were mesmerizing, and next to zero wire-fu.  Overall this movie was great.  It didn't have a english subtitle option, with the original language track, but that didn't seem to matter since this english dubbed version didn't suffer from any ""sappiness.""  The story was good from beginning to end.  If you're a big fan of fight scenes, this is definitely one you want to check out.  Aside from the exciting fight scenes, it has a good blend of comedy (not over the top), and a little bit of ""Shaolin philosophy.""  If you are looking for a good movie, just check this out.  You won't be disappointed.",992044800,,742,4.568181818181818
1078922,4,6305794669,buddha be praised....a bad seed monk returns to his old stomping grouds to wreak havok til someone good enough can stop him.who stops him?not his former wine-n-chicken consuming master who's no slouch but a student with a thirst for kung fu knowledge.a little comedy lots of hand to hand action and very little wire fu.quality for a movie of this type is pretty good...scratches and artifacts don't hinder your viewing pleasure with good color throughout the film.the movie is dubbed in typical old school fashion which is very satisfactory.this film is not widescreen but a decent transfer for these rare movies is what matters most-n-this no exception....pick this one up if you can....,985046400,,688,5.097345132743363

1079100,5,6305794669,"Let's be honest with each other for a moment.  Sometimes everyone needs to see a movie that appeals to them on every level no matter how much sense it may make.  That is exactly what this movie is to a kung fu movie fan. The story is kinda out there and involves a young monk who happens to cross a young kung fu fighter trying to find someone who can beat him, and ends up being an enthralling slug fest featuring many different styles of kung fu.  This movie although amazingly awesome is also pretty corny and as such has many memorable one liners, some of which you may be familiar with if you are a fan of the wu tang clan.  Thats all i'm gonna say.  If you are a kung fu fan you habve not excuse not to watch this movie.",1182556800,,726,4.048951048951049
1079101,3,6305794669,"This movie is just funny.  Memories of kung fu theatre on saturdays at noon rushed through my head as I watched this goofy romp.  Ridiculous dubbing, an awful story line and some great martial arts action a la the old days of the genre.  The choreography reminded me of a capoeira match where the fighters are just barely missing each other on purpose.  I wish I could've seen it in the original cantonese or mandarin with subtitles as the films are always better.  Worth watching if you love kung fu flicks.",1174089600,,508,4.538461538461538

1079103,5,6305794669,"It would be a gross dis-service to give out details on this flick,,,,almost everyone who review this movie gave it 5 stars,,,therefore, that should suffice for anyone to make a decission to check out this awesome, amazing kicker!!

Three words for this flick TOUGH, TOUGH, TOUGH.  This flick is easily among my top 5 best ever kung fu movie of all times,,,I must have watched this flick over 10 times, and each times feel like the first,,it just an amazing flick!!",1151712000,,464,4.716049382716049
1079104,5,6305794669,"Awesome, old school kung fu at it's best!

This movie kept me interested from beginning to end. Fight scenes were well choreographed and the characters were awesome. This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over again.

On another note, I noticed a few lines of dialogue in this movie that have been used in the Wu-Tang Clan album ""Enter the Wu-Tang, 36 Chambers"". Which I thought was pretty kewl.",1150329600,,403,4.506849315068493

1079106,5,6305794669,"I love this movie for its fighting styles and funny dialogue. Even though it was made somewhat 20+ years ago, it is still worth every penny today. My father owns this on VH-1 with others and I had to add this to my DVD collection. If you're a old school martial arts movie fan, I recommend this movie!",1126915200,6,301,4.206896551724138
1079107,5,6305794669,""" If I had not given it 5 stars, I would regard myself as an idiot!""

I came across this movie in a video store and had to get the DVD to add to my collection! The dubbing is beautifully done, and transfer to DVD id very good. FULL screen but hey, it's a great movie.

This movie is classic kung Fu. It has a great story and excellent fight scenes. There is drama, comedy, philosophy and it really gets the adrenaline pumping. A great blend of action with many, many kung fu styles.

""Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shao-lin,  the special technique of Shadow boxing!"" Oh.. what a joy!  No WIRES like today's so called stars. Yes, some trampoline is done but it is minimal, occurring in one or two of the countless scenes and does not take away from the fight scenes!

""loooky here.. Look who has become a Shaolin monk.. Are you ready to die now?"" Then begins a pure attack that is unstoppable!

The villain's skill is breathtaking! If you know anything about fighting then you can see that this guy means business. He attacks with a series of blows, chops, kicks and punches to the vital organs in one smooth continuous movement which gives almost no chance to the opponent...PURE attack! Beautiful!

You will see many styles here tiger, snake, mantis, butterfly fist, monkey, sword techniques, Bhudda finger,  drunken boxing...

Our hero is out if his depth.. His master tells him "" Your kung fu is still poor- you won't last long out side!"" J Ah.. the comedy!

Then the final encounter- masterly!

Thoroughly enjoyable. I watch it over and over... it is that good!",1100995200,9,1572,4.535460992907802

7895454,4,6305794669,"""I am Sung Yee-tung. I like kung fu, and I want to be your student,"" says wandering martial artist Sung Yee-tung (Alexander Lo Rei) who ever seeks to expand his skills and learn new fighting styles. Sung Yee-tung is a pretty brash dude - he hasn't lost a match in five years - and his modus operandi consists of challenging kung fu masters in duels, and only should they beat him would they be worthy of becoming his teacher. In helping a rascally young Shaolin monk out of a jam, Sung Yee-tung stumbles on a grouchy, grizzled Shaolin grandmaster whom he challenges into a fight. The old (but amazingly spry) grandmaster makes our guy eat his words and, in a really gross moment, the grandmaster's nasty stenchy foot as well. Except that the old monk refuses to take Sung Yee-tung on as his student. Many years ago a disciple had betrayed the Shaolin temple and stolen away with the secret Shaolin kung fu manual, and so the elder Shaolin monks have grown supremely paranoid.

Sung Yee-tung isn't only brash, he's pretty persistent. And several comedy bits unfold as he tries to trick the old monk into teaching him his martial arts moves. The old monk is a kooky old monk, kooky enough that he goes against the Shaolin tradition of avoiding red meat and alcohol. So we get scenes in which Sung Yee-tung is sparring with old monk while old monk is tearing into a chicken. At one point, old dude actually declares: ""Buddha's name be praised. I enjoy good food and wine, and I love a fight."" He ain't fibbin'.

What finally gets Sung Yee-tung an in is the return of Fan-lin, that very same disciple who betrayed the Shaolin temple so long ago. Except it turns out that Fan-lin (Chen Shan) is actually a Tibetan lama who infiltrated and turned on the Shaolin monks as payback for his master's death at the hands of a Shaolin abbot. Fan-lin now sports a villainous mustache and also heads up a powerful clan, and he means to wipe out all other fighting clans. Fan-lin's gaze falls on Sung Yee-tung when our guy ends up saving the daughter of a clan leader whom Fan-lin had targeted. At this stage, the eccentric old Shaolin grandmaster - who seems to prefer flipping his way onto a scene instead of walking on like normal God-fearing people - decides to teach Sung Yee-tung his craft. Sung Yee-tung converts to Buddhism, gets his head shaved, and rapidly learns just how woefully inferior he is in skills. Sung Yee-tung, no longer brash. It'll take all he's got to master the advanced Shaolin Buddha Finger technique. He'll need it to defeat the evil-mustached Fan-lin and the shiny tacky lama robe he strolled in on.

The Tibetan lama, the ""traditional enemy of Shaolin""? Not so much. I mean, these cats are all monks, for cripes' sake. This so-called enmity was fabricated to add juice to the film. 1983's SHAOLIN VS. LAMA kicks it old school, and I think it's worth your time watching it. This is one of Alexander Lo Rei's best martial arts films, and he sells it with his kung fu and with his muscular frame. There's plenty of fights, with all but one participants convincing with their skills and their acrobatics. Really, only the clan leader's daughter comes off as weak in her wushu sword-fighting.

SHAOLIN VS. LAMA presents a predictable story and is primed with stock characters, but that doesn't stop William Yen (the young Shaolin monk sidekick) from providing good comic relief. I can't dis on the typically crazy arduous training montages, though, because I simply love those. But, in the actual fight sequences, can the fighters spit out any more fluids just to demonstrate how hard they were hit? For a minute, I thought I was watching a Buddha-blessed wine tasting flick.

I know Shaolin monks do this in every movie, but it tickled me how often they keep saying ""Buddha's name be praised."" The phrase seems to be a sort of blanket declarative; it covers a lot of ground. ""Buddha's name be praised"" could be a conversation ice breaker or it could punctuate a statement or even stand in for ""Oh, snap! Our fellow monk here lies dead."" It rather makes me want to punch a perfectly circular hole thru a dangling scroll with my Shaolin-trained knuckle. It's a fun movie.",1283040000,,4180,4.658536585365853
7895455,5,6305794669,"This movie Shaolin vs. Lama has a variety of action in it, but the Villan had the advantage with the Army that he has with him. So, the main actor has a hard time to defeat the Villan. I gave the movie 5 stars, because of the action seens of Kung Fu been displayed in the movie.",1188259200,,278,3.8947368421052633
