8659975,3,B00KM9R7DC,Would have been better without the movie Coming & Going. That movies was the worst movie I have ever seen. Sasha Alexander was good as always but the material that poor woman had to work with was just awful! I bought the disc set for the movie entitled The Hired Heart. This movie is well worth your time as well as the price of the rest of the movies. I had owned another copy of The Hired Heart before but the disc had broken and was looking for a replacement. If you want a great movie with humor and heart you won't find one better. Some of the other titles were good as well but my favorite was The Hired Heart. That is five stars for The Hired Heart and no stars for the Coming & Going so on average disc total is a three star.,1456012800,,733,4.027397260273973
