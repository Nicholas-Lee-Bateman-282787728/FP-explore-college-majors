8734320,5,B015QMZYAM,"I did my yoga teacher training with Syl and am so grateful for this DVD and the in person practice to guide my breath.  In yoga, we learn that the breath is one of the most--if not THE most--important component in a successful practice.  It is the life force.  I love that this DVD really breaks down different types of breath and teaches you more about how to use each one.  I've come to love just sitting still and breathing.  It helps me to be calm, energized, or to become motivated depending on what I need each day.  For anyone who wants a more in depth study, this is a great place to start.  You won't be left in the dust.",1480377600,,630,4.1570247933884295
8734321,5,B015QMZYAM,"This was a great guide to daily pranayama practice. The first part of the practice explains pranayama. It goes into the benefits of the practice; physical and how it relates to stress. For me, and what I needed to hear most, was having compassion for myself when doing a breath practice. I have always resisted breath practice of any kind. BUT this guides you into multiple ways to breath. Syl guides you into each practice and you do a full practice and then have the ability to focus on one practice or doing them all. A great tool for beginners!!",1465084800,,549,4.5
