8505618,5,B000YKYT4E,This is a wonderful instructional DVD.  The instructor and dances make the steps so clear and easy to follow without too much repetition. Great for novices and intermediate dancers. The couple is a beautiful example of ballroom dancers!,1502064000,,236,5.2105263157894735
8505619,2,B000YKYT4E,"Do not like the format and disappointed with this purchase. As a beginner, I prefer step by step instructions, not seeing the guy dance first, then have the woman join him to dance.",1440460800,,181,4.515151515151516
8505620,4,B000YKYT4E,"I don't recommend it too beginners! I think it's a little too much for beginning dancers.  Too few examples of the moves, but that's what they have replay for. However, I'm very happy with it.  Well worth the discounted price. I've purchased or reviewed close to 100 dance DVDs.  Initially, over a year ago, when I started dancing and buying dance DVDs; I was extremely unhappy with Teresa Masons DVDs. They were too difficult for me to follow.  Now, after learning the very basics of dance, I've pretty much purchased all of hers for under $12.00 each.  Reason: I think ""Most bang for the Buck"" if you buy them as cheaply as possible.",1237161600,3,635,4.584070796460177
