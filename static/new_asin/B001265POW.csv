3077770,4,B001265POW,"If I had been aware that it was a university-band performing with Q at this concert I had probably not purchased it.
Luckily I did not know and a Q-fan as I am I was not disappointed. The ""kids"" shine when directed by Q. A blunder here and there does not spoil the overall enthusiasm. It must have been the concert of that year. Q and the soloists are in great shape and I keep coming back to the very last song: LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL. And please do.",1205107200,5,452,4.033333333333333

3077772,5,B001265POW,"Great value, great production and a fine array of talent makes this ""tribute"" DVD a must buy for Q afficionados

Worth the price alone for the superb rendition of ""Walking In Space"" feat. Patti Austin (surely one of THE most underrated singers?) and the enigmatic ""Toots"" Thielemans on a fab rendition of ""Grace Notes""

The in-house band features Greg Phillinganes, A. Ray Fuller, Nathan East, Steve Ferrone & Luis Conte; also featured is the Northern Illinois University Jazz Band - sterling work

Highly recommended",1203984000,5,517,5.130952380952381

8244196,2,B001265POW,"Not what I expected. Never seen Quincy Jones perform before and that is why I bought the DVD. But I was not very happy with the music dished out. His voice at times was inaudible. The picture and sound quality was good but not the type of music I Like. This is my personal opinion. For people who like strictly Jazz, this DVD would be good.",1285718400,,340,4.166666666666667
