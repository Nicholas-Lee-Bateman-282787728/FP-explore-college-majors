320809,5,6301232038,I play this video at least 3 times a week in the evenings.  I am an artist and having the visual colors and patterns is so meaningful for me.  Watching it in the evenings after stretching exercises has helped me to  sleep better.  It is excellent for relieving stresses of the day or week.  I was checking it out of my local library so often that my husband wanted  me to buy it!,919036800,4,379,4.123287671232877
320866,5,6301232038,"Such a valuable, basic help with chakras.  Wonderful for meditation.  Wish it came in an updated version.  Nonetheless, if you can get hands on one, do so!",1403913600,,155,4.666666666666667
320867,5,6301232038,My only regret is that this is not available on DVD. Shirley MacLaine explains the chakra system so that it is easy to understand & the meditations are wonderful!!!,1401840000,,164,4.689655172413793
320868,5,6301232038,"This is perfect for anyone with stress, loss of a loved one, or anxiety!  At the end of the tape you will feel stronger, calm, and renewed!  I have my original tape bought when it came out and didn't use it often as I couldn't find a replacement.  Now that I have this one I can use it everyday to help keep me stress free!",1376092800,,323,3.9384615384615387
320869,5,6301232038,I haven't found anything on the market as good as this is for aligning your chakras.  I would love to have it in DVD format or as a digital download.,1374883200,3,149,3.966666666666667
320870,5,6301232038,"I wish this came on dvd
Such a healing inner workout, you come out balanced and centered!  I have never met a person that did not love this dvd after trying it",1368489600,,159,3.96875
320871,5,6301232038,"I bought this classic video cassette years ago, and recently bought another one ""in case"" my original purchase should break.
The tape provides a basic explanation of the human chakra system, and it includes a powerful meditation based on a
GORGEOUS series of moving color mandalas to watch as you balance your chakras in front of your TV.
Experiencing this tape/using it can improve your ability to visualize colors, which may
be useful if you are interested in certain alternative healing modalities.  I think this is MacLaine's best work.

Why (sniffle) couldn't I find a more up-to-date technology (i.e. a CD) of this gem????",1354579200,,628,5.028846153846154
320872,5,6301232038,"I don't know about you but I am always looking for inexpensive ways to get a break from the usual daily grind and chores. Movies, a good book, a bike ride into town etc. And this meditation video is IT!

The presentation starts with a short tutorial about the Eastern Indian Chakra system (Indian version of the Asian CHI). And then goes into an opened eyed meditation which leads you through a balancing of these Chakras or energy centers we have in our body. It ends with a closed eyed meditation all led by Shirley M.

I watched the tutorial once and now, I skip it and go straight to the opened eyed meditation. The music and visuals are stunning and hypnotic and by the time I'm done with the 20 minutes or so it takes to complete, I feel like I have had a true break. I'm relaxed and refreshed.
Sometimes I watch it before I go to bed at night and I sleep great!!!
The closed eyed meditation at the end is nice but the open eyed meditation seems more accessible and enjoyable.

If you are interested in meditation but have a hard time letting go of the worries of the day or you mind seems so active you cannot seem to find that quiet space in yourself, try this video. I believe it is an easier way to give our mind, body and soul a real nurturing break.

Thanks Shirley!!!

320873,3,6301232038,"I bought this video because I had viewed it before and was interested in it for the content.  I expected a new copy to have better picture quality.  Sadly, that was not the case.  Given the price, it was extremely disappointing.",1269129600,,228,4.512195121951219
320874,5,6301232038,I love this video and have owned it for year. Great introduction to chakras and has wonderful meditations with beautiful visuals.,1219276800,,129,5.190476190476191
320875,5,6301232038,"I used this tape many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed the meditation results. I had forgotten that I had the tape and after taking an energy healing course, discovered that in order to run good energy, it helps to have your chakras in ""good working order"". I have gotten the tape out and started with the meditation once again. I found it to be even better than before because I have a fuller understanding of what the chakras are, why they need to be in good working order and I am thrilled that this is allowing me to run a higher rate of energy for healing purposes.",1186012800,4,570,4.336448598130841
320906,4,6301232038,"Wonderful vhs. Shirley's use of sound and color leaves you feeling quite renewed.

The actual vhs was not in as good a condition as the seller promised.",1167782400,,152,4.62962962962963
320907,5,6301232038,This contains a great meditation and chakra explanation. It is on DVD but evidently the only way to get it is through Shirley MacLaine's web site. Its now called Inner Power but is a remake of the VHS tape. Many DVD's on her web site.,1165449600,,234,4.222222222222222
320908,5,6301232038,I purchased this tape for my mother as a gift. She watches it a few times a week and deeply enjoys the relaxation it provides her with. I have watched it and feel it is profound for those who can accept what it offers. The quality is good. This was a good investment.,1063152000,8,267,4.056603773584905
320909,5,6301232038,"I love to use the open eyed meditation.  It would be great as a DVD so I could get better sound, color, and jump right to the meditation each day.  I used the video so much the tape is worn out.  Could someone tell me if this is already a work in progress?",1018742400,6,256,3.792452830188679
320910,3,6301232038,Great meditation tape. Great resource when you want to meditate or when you are with stress. Beautiful for the eyes.,1003708800,2,116,4.85
320911,5,6301232038,"I've been using this for meditation off & on for over 5 years. I fell in love with the kaleidoscoping colors immediately!  If you love colors, you'll be ecstatic when you see the beautiful  images in this.  I have viewed it so often that I'm afraid the tape will break.  This really, really needs to be available on DVD!!",996710400,6,321,4.389830508474576
320912,5,6301232038,"Years ago I rented this from the library, took the half hour to go through the meditation with Shirley (now on a first name basis) :) and felt the best I had felt in years.  This is not riligeous but more spiritual in  nature.  It clenses and make you feel good inside and out.",965001600,3,277,4.092592592592593
320913,5,6301232038,"Shirley MacLaine takes you step by step through her meditative, spiritual and physical belief system. She speaks knowledgeably on the subject, and she allows you time to process the information if you are a newcomer. She  does not talk down to you, and neither does she make it so incomprehensible  that it's useless. It's a pragmatic approach to relieving the stress of  daily living. I highly recommend it.",958867200,23,408,4.970588235294118
320914,5,6301232038,"A refresshing workout for the body,mind and spirit.  I first viewed this video in a class for Reiki Training.  I since have used this same video in teaching my students about the Chakra system and to give them a gentle and  wonderful first experience in guided meditation.  I am so pleased to know  that this video is available on line as the copy I have used is in need of  replacement.  I will be sure to pass this information along to past  students as well as all future students as a must for their vedio  libraries.  Peace, Light and Love to all who view this and especially to  Shirley MacLaine for listening to her inner guides and making such a huge  difference in so many lives.....Bless you all.",928972800,19,706,4.4296875

7810379,5,6301232038,"I ordered Shirley Maclaines VHS tape. Watching some scenes of  the meditations. Her voice is very pleasant to listen to and she  is very knowledgeable . I only wish it would be available on a DVD. I own many CD on subject meditation, but Shirley Maclains  is the most enjoyable to practice the chakra meditation. So many Cd or DVD have either background music I do not care for, and some do not have pleasant voices to listen to for the length  of the chakra  meditation. So happy that Amazon again  come thru getting  her meditation instruction,since it is quite a few years old, yet often written about it. Peoples praises and stories made my mind up to also purchase the tape, and now after watching it,I know this will be the one I really prefer to listen to.",1446595200,,763,4.446043165467626

7810381,5,6301232038,"It took me years to find another copy of this chakra balancing VHS.  I wish someone would create DVDs from this VHS and sell them.  This is one of the best chakra balancing videos I have ever seen.  Shirley Maclaine goes into great detail to teach you all about the seven main chakras and then goes through a balancing session with you.  Afterwards, I felt so relaxed.  To this day, I have not found a better video than this one to help me relax.  My copy either got stolen or lost at some point, and it has taken me a very long time to find another copy of this video.  I still have a VCR and hope that it still works so I can watch this to relax and hopefully sleep better again.  I am very happy I found this again.  I highly recommend it to everyone and hope someone out there will create some DVDs from it soon.  I received this well packaged and new from the seller in 4 days time from ordering it.  I have used it and it is just as good as it was when it was first released in 1988.",1430438400,2,989,3.9948979591836733
