2175833,5,B00068S9E0,I have tried the African Bound so far and loved the African dance steps.  The Ballet Bound look like fun. Loe the vriety of different work out.  Jo Jo is fun and like the stretching he did. Most of the workout on any of the taps don't do much stretching.  Working out on the rebounder is great on your joints.,1233014400,2,309,4.116666666666666
2175834,5,B00068S9E0,"You don't need to pay over $50 for this video. Look online using the title and you can find the video for $29.99 at several reliable and secure exercise video sites. Now, about the video. I haven't been so excited about an exercise video, perhaps ever. While the instructor is a touch chatty, I had no difficulty following her, even the first time. And the resistance workout? Wow! I was sweaty and completely energized. Good thought went into it. There is  a choice for intro, where the instructor walks you through the moves that will appear in the video. As a clutz, why don't more do that? I've told me friends and my husband about this great collection and will be telling more, I'm sure.",1186358400,26,693,4.544
2175835,5,B00068S9E0,a good variety of half hour workouts to suit your different days moods. Your feel envigorated after each one.,1153699200,15,109,4.7894736842105265
2175836,5,B00068S9E0,"I really love this compliation. It really is one of my favorites. The resistance bound is great for toning the arms. Traci really gets you going I love all of her work outs.

Sports Specific bound is a nice change from the others on this video. It kind of gives you that extra boost to finish off the day.

I really enjoyed ballet bound. It was fun even though I'm not a ballet dancer. It really helped improve my balance.

African bound just scared me. I'm not that great of a dancer, and this video made it even more confusing. It looked fun at first. But when I tried it, it was just... bad.",1130284800,45,594,4.192982456140351
2175843,5,B00068S9E0,"This is the best of all the compilations for me.  These routines are moderate and doable for a 67 yr old woman with hypertension.  The orignals, the basics, etc. are entirely too energetic, lol.  I could have done them in my 30s before developing hypertension.",1457308800,,260,4.733333333333333

2175849,3,B00068S9E0,I don't think this will be one of my staples.  The best workout in the series comes from a woman who had way too much coffee.  For some reason this woman totally cracks me up.  But I like her and she provided the best workout on the dvd.,1421625600,,237,3.8958333333333335

2175853,5,B00068S9E0,"First of all I Love urban rebounding! I'm 47 and have been working out daily for most of my life. I started rebounding about a year ago and I have never felt better. I lost weight, had a significant reduction in cellulite and generally feel better than I did in all my other workouts.  The best part is that I look forward to these workouts. The instructors are fantastic. I think I'm in love with all of them. This CD is the most fun and I feel the most beneficial  of all. The resistance is the most challenging, and the sports is the most well rounded, The ballet is both fun and challenging, My favorite is the African. It's not difficult and is the one I choose when I want a feel good exercise session. They say not to, but I enjoy doing this one barefoot.",1399680000,9,762,4.212328767123288
2175854,2,B00068S9E0,"I bought all of the dvds when I first got my trampoline.  Let's just say I haven't been able to sit through one full session.  There is one particular lady that is especially irritating in her attitude and mannerisms and it makes it all the harder to watch.  I'm not kidding.  And, it seems - she is in all of the exercise sessions I was particularly interested in.  Also, it seems like when I want to go faster - the video goes slower - when I want to go slower - it is going faster.  Perhaps it is just me, but I prefer to just listen to music and do different moves on my trampoline instead.  I keep holding on to hope - though - and perhaps I will take these out again soon and see if I can tolerate them.  The only one that I do care for is the dvd for kids.

If there is any way that you can preview the video before buying - I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately, I jumped right in and excitedly bought these without thinking (just got my trampoline).  This way you can see for sure if it is for you.",1385078400,4,1007,4.010050251256281
2175855,5,B00068S9E0,"Wow, just got my video this past Saturday.  Tried the 1st workout on the dvd, and really enjoyed it.  What a workout!  Way better than the old dvd I had.  Looking forward to doing the rest of the 3 workouts on this dvd.",1381104000,,219,4.023255813953488

2175857,5,B00068S9E0,"Like the other dvd's this isn't the hightest quality and can be difficult to play in an older player.  Resistance Bound is a great workout led by Tracie.  You need some light weights and you still feel sore even if you only use 1 or 2 lbs.  Ballet Bound is tough, its the only workout where you turn your feet out and it uses different muscles.  Sports Specific Bound is pretty good, its my 3rd favorite.  My least favorite is the African Bound.  Its a slower paced workout and it doesn't get your heart rate up for a good cario workout.",1346630400,4,537,4.267326732673268
2175858,2,B00068S9E0,"I tried to like this workout. I just couldn't get into it, the instructors were either to over the top or didn't seem all that interested in their class. While I like that the workouts are shorter in length, I just felt it could have also been more intense. I have a busy life so I like quality workouts in the amount of time I have to workout.",1331510400,5,344,4.073529411764706
2175859,4,B00068S9E0,My husband made fun of me when I said I wanted a mini tramp to exercise on.  I love it and I'm seeing results.  I like the first 3 workouts on this DVD.  The first one with weights really works your upper body.  The sports one is ok and the ballet workout is hard.  It challenges my balance.  I am not a beginner when it comes to working out.  I did 2 triathlon sprints this past summer and I feel like rebounding is a good workout.  Gets my heart rate up and makes me sweat. I like the DVD compilation #3 even better.,1322265600,7,518,3.9611650485436893
2175860,2,B00068S9E0,"I must say, they make good workout programs, but really need to improve DVD quality. Sadly I can only use 2 out of 4 workouts because of bad pixelation. Although it was still a good price, dealing with bad DVD is frustrating.",1321747200,3,225,4.380952380952381
2175861,5,B00068S9E0,I enjoy both the sports specific and the resistance bound. I have not tried the ballet or the other workout.  Both instructers are enthusiastic. I rotate these workouts with weight training and get great results.,1303344000,3,212,5.057142857142857
2175862,1,B00068S9E0,"I bought this DVD (brand new) specifically for the Resistance Bound and Ballet Bound workouts. The audio/video of the Resistance Bound workout was choppy and kept pixelating so that I could not figure out what was being said or done. I was able to watch the Sports Specific Bound workout (with a few pixelation problems), but when I tried to access the Ballet Bound workout, the DVD stopped and started from the beginning. I tried playing it on a couple of players with the same result -- what a disappointment! I'm waiting for other Urban Rebounding Compilations (also brand new) and hope to have better luck with them.",1253145600,3,620,4.75

8040350,5,B00068S9E0,"This is a fun DVD. I especially like 'Resistance Bound' and 'Ballet Bound'. Sports bound is intervals of different sports like moves, and African bound is a fun different workout with neat music, although it didn't get my heart rate up very high - I still enjoyed it though. They're all fun with different moves than the basic bounding workout.",1478995200,,344,4.75
