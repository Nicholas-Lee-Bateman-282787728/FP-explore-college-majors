3549390,3,B001ECP576,"i don't regret buying this set! the shows are interesting and nostalgic to me. the content of the stories are not quite on the level of the untouchables but they are way higher than dragnet in my opinion. the people who put this set together did a very good job with the materials they had to work with.
im watching these episodes on a 65"" large screen and its very watchable if you adjust your brightness control and sometimes your treble control on your audio.im so glad they put this out because previously the copies available were horrible quality, if you could find them,and they were not sold cheap. if your looking for hi def video quality go out and buy csi or something not so rare. im personaly glad m squad is now available.",1232323200,11,736,4.45925925925926
3549391,5,B001ECP576,"A true classic not only for nostalgia lovers. The less than half hour episodes is enough for total enjoyment of these police cases, brilliantly played by Lee Marvin. As for most late 50's series, the jazz based music (Count Basie) matches perfectly the overall quality of the series. Great packaging also!!",1231286400,4,306,5.019607843137255
3549392,5,B001ECP576,"Watching Lee Marvin as the lead on 1957-59's police show in Chicago was a treat. It was an old fashioned police story with the police doin their jobs, not entangled with personal relationships. Besides Marvin's acting, it was fun trying to spot the many actors who appeared on he show before their own big break,such as , Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Tom Laughlin, Burt Reynolds,Leonard Nimoy twice as a crook, and Deforrest Kelly four times as a policeman. All three seasons are here .",1230422400,6,488,4.821428571428571
3549393,4,B001ECP576,"Yes, the quality of the episodes varies from not so good to totally watchable, and the sound is about the same on the scale of things, but I'm thrilled just to be able to take a few hours at a time and treat myself to a batch of M Squad's in any form!  I had low expectations when I read about how this set came together, and thus far, after watching 5 discs, my expectations have been exceeded.  I've not seen an episode I couldn't make sense out of and to be honest, watching these late at night on my cathode ray tube makes me feel like I'm a kid again watching something clandestine and forbidden, mostly due to the quality.  It's like being out in the sticks and then after everyone has gone to bed a signal is being beamed into my living room thrusting me into a time warp where the signal comes over the air instead of a cable or satellite feed and if I aim the rabbit ears just right Frank Ballinger comes into focus and solves the heinous crime in question...and the music, and the black and white photography, and the Chicago exteriors and dingy interiors...I love this set and highly recommend it to any fan of Lee Marvin, hard-boiled crime procedurals, and noir milleu.....I'm happy to have it and if you have issues with pristine images versus down and dirty, then maybe you should stick with your Heroes and King Of Queens box sets and leave this one for the real fans!  When I get to the end I'm going to start over as this set stays right by the TV Set at least until someone releases the complete Johnny Staccato series and then Marvin can alternate with Cassavetes.....",1229904000,56,1587,4.3694915254237285
3549394,4,B001ECP576,"This box set has a few good and a few bad.

First the good. Yes, it does include all 117 episodes in chronological order from the first to the last. All three seasons. The bonus CD is great and I wouldn't ask for better.

Brief summary: M-SQUAD was a product of its time. Why people compare it to DRAGNET I have no idea. There is no comparison. The show features jazz music which PETER GUNN and SHOTGUN SLADE and MAN FROM UNCLE did. Jazzy music scores were a fad at the time. Lee Marvin makes the show shine. Without him, it would have been another cop program. The show is extremely violent. Heck, the opener has Marvin coming out of his car, being shot at and he fires back. Before the opening credits roll it's already featuring four gun shots. Critics complained in the early 1960s because of the violence. Heck, watch the one episode that opens with a family being killed off (women and children) when someone throws a live pineapple (grenade) into thier back yard!

Like a lot of 50s TV shows, the guests are occassionally impressive and a surprise. Angie Dickinson, Charles Bronson, Leonard Nimoy, Ed Nelson, DeForest Kelley, H. M. Wynant and even a young Burt Reynolds. Don't look up the cast list in advance - just watch them and be surprised when they appear on screen. Plenty of other supporting role characters would have been just as notable had they later hit the success the above did but you'll certainly see other familiar faces.

There is one episode in the second season that depicted Chicago cops in a bad light and that episode alone prompted the then-current mayor of Chicago to ban filming in the streets of Chicago. That ban would not be lifted until the early 1980s when they filmed THE BLUES BROTHERS. Yep, this show REALLY worth watching.

Now the bad news: these episodes were not from the original studio negatives. As pointed out in other reviews, they are certainly transfers from 16mm prints. Not that this is a bad thing, but instead of getting 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 in picture quality you get 8.5 to 9.5 depending on the print. Some episodes are great, others are a bit washed out or too bright and a few are missing 1 or 2 minutes from the prints.

Still, it comes down to this or nothing. And the price cannot be beat for 117 episodes. I only give it four stars instead of five because of the occassional lack of good prints. Buy it today!",1229472000,21,2378,4.467741935483871
3549395,4,B001ECP576,"""M Squad"" has the reputation, deservedly so, as being one of the key television crime series of the 1950s.  Lee Marvin stars as Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, fighting crime in the mean streets of Chicago.  What works for this show is the casting of tough guy Marvin, the location filming, and the half hour time-frame of this series, which forced the series' writers to create tight scripts for the show.  ""M Squad"" has been referred to as one of the prime examples of ""TV noir"" and it's easy to see why based on the episodes that I've had a chance to watch so far in this 15-DVD set, which includes all 117 episodes from the series' three seasons (1957-60).  The series is probably closest in tone to the original 1950s version of ""Dragnet,"" and includes plenty of voice over narration by Marvin, just like Jack Webb's narration in ""Dragnet.""  And one of the early episodes in this DVD release includes no fewer than four actors from Webb's ""stock company"" of actors who appeared on ""Dragnet"" multiple times (William Bryant, Herb Ellis, Olan Soule and Peggy Webber).  But ""M Squad"" is a tougher, more hard-boiled series devoid of ""Dragnet's"" lighter moments and, unlike Webb's Sgt. Joe Friday, Marvin's Lt. Ballinger goes it alone without a partner more often than not.  It's easy to see why ""M Squad"" made Lee Marvin a bankable star . . . . once the crime is committed in the opening sequence, Marvin is in virtually every scene as he pieces the evidence together.

This is a vintage TV-on-DVD set that's a bit tougher to evaluate given the circumstances surrounding its release.  The DVD releasing company, the Timeless Media Group, has a licensing arrangement with NBC Universal for this series and several others like ""Checkmate"" and ""Arrest and Trial"" where they have DVD release rights only.  Universal did not provide Timeless with any prints for this series and Timeless had to secure prints on its own, including reaching out to collectors who own 16 millimeter prints of the series.  Originally, this set was slated to have 100 episodes, but collectors of the series contributed the additional 17 episodes necessary for a complete series release.  Consequently, the audio/visual presentation for ""M Squad"" is highly variable.  None of the episodes that I've viewed so far are of the razor sharp quality found in vintage TV releases from the major studios and, frankly, these episodes are much closer in audio/visual quality to public domain releases from companies like Alpha Video or Mill Creek Entertainment; those who are familiar with some of the public domain episodes of the 1950s version of ""Dragnet"" will know what to expect.  So here's the dilemma for prospective purchasers of this release.  Does one buy this set with very inconsistent audio/visual quality, or does one hold out for something better in the future?  The series' rights holder, Universal, seems to be releasing fewer vintage television releases on its own, preferring to license some of its older series to companies like Shout! Factory (""McHale's Navy,"" ""Ironside,"" ""Adam-12""), Arts Alliance America (""Banacek"") and Timeless Media (several TV westerns and the aforementioned ""Checkmate"" and ""Arrest and Trial"").  So it's unlikely that ""M Squad"" will ever see a release directly from Universal, given the cost of restoring and remastering episodes.  Ultimately, the purchasing decision for ""M Squad"" is a trade-off in audio/visual quality versus the chance to own all 117 episodes, plus the set's sole bonus item . . . a music CD soundtrack of the show.

At best, the audio/visual quality of this release would earn no more that three stars, but the fact that Timeless has included the entire run of this rare-to-see series, plus a bonus music CD, earns the set an additional star.  Videophiles will want to avoid this set, but fans of the series will appreciate the opportunity to own the entire series in a single package.",1229299200,20,3919,4.9815950920245395
3549396,2,B001ECP576,"It's great that this series is out in a full 117 episode box set, but whoever is responsible for the video transfers obviously didn't know what they were doing.  16mm syndication prints were the source elements for the transfers and if they were professionally done they would look far better than they do here.  It appears that someone ran these off on a home system of sorts as there is no control over contrast levels at all.  Sometimes the episodes have completely blown out contrast and are murky in the extreme, other times there is no contrast at all, with everything appearing a milky gray color.  The prints are dirty, with hairs often getting in the gate and the sound quality is like mud on some episodes.  This show was originally shot on 35mm film and if a proper transfer had been done, it could have looked glorious.  As-is, some episodes look like they came off of bad kinescopes, which isn't the case.  Even using 16mm prints should have yielded much better results than this.  I certainly hope the original elements survive on this show and hopefully someone will one day give this show a proper presentation.  Until then, we're stuck with this mess.  Yes, I'm glad to have the DVD collection, but it's obvious that every expense was spared in the making of it.",1228089600,126,1279,4.644444444444445
3549397,3,B001ECP576,"I started watching this series and as far as the stories go the series lives up to its billing. The problem is the picture quality. I've watched the first few episodes and spot checked some of the later ones. While the picture quality is passable its not much better than public domain copies of shows like Dragnet. Do not expect to see anywhere near the picture quality of shows on DVD like ""The Untouchables"". I realize that some of the episodes were donated by fans because they could not be found but the quality of the other episodes is not much better. Buy this set because of the stories and Lee Marvin. Just wish the picture quality had been better.",1227830400,59,657,4.483333333333333
3549398,5,B001ECP576,"For Billy Jack fans this will be quite a treat.  Tom Laughlin, who later went on to write, produce, direct, and star in the Billy Jack film series, appears in the M Squad episode ""Trade School"".  I have a 16mm print of that episode and I'm glad to see that it will soon be available on DVD.  In the episode, Laughlin throws the principal of the school out the window.  In Billy Jack he threw Dinosaur out of the window of the ice cream parolor.  So, if you're ever in the company of Tom Laughlin, keep away from the window.",1225670400,7,523,4.19
3549399,5,B001ECP576,"I've been waititing along time for this series. Next to ""The Naked City"" & ""Peter Gunn"" this is my favorite from that era. All that I could ever find were inferior bootleg copies at memorabilia shows.

I thought it was great how the company putting this out appealed to the general public for episodes they didn't have & the public responded to make the series complete.

I like how it's actually filmed in many places in Chicago, the locale for this outstanding Lee Marvin show, the only tv series he did. It's like a weekly film noir for TV! The music (a bonus CD of M-Squad music is included), plots, atmosphere, acting, etc, are all outstanding. If you like gritty detective shows from the 1950's, don't pass this up. It's really fine watching late at night when there's a storm outside & you have the right atmosphere at home. ENJOY THIS CLASSIC SERIES!",1222128000,28,858,4.601307189542483

Great series with the great Lee Marvin. He was a real tough in the series and in real life as he was Marine in WWII and got a purple heart during the invasion of Japanese held-Island Saipan.

Most of the video is very good, a few episodes show a little wear and tear. Good solid scripts and acting particularly Marvins performance.
Lee Marvin is a believable tough guy probably because he was a real tough guy, not a Hollywood creation.

3549435,4,B001ECP576,"First, the show:
If you like fifties crime shows or retro tv, this is a must-have! Imagine ""Dragnet"" with (much) more testosterone, more action, (much) more bloodshed, and a faster pace. Throw in unusual camera angles, great dime detective novel-type dialogue, and an actor (Lee Marvin) who acts as if he was born to play the part of the tough and overworked Chicago detective to beat all Chicago detectives and you get ""M Squad."" There's plenty to distinguish this show from the many crime shows that were broadcast in the fifties: for one thing, there's violence - bloody violence. When someone gets in a car wreck (episode one), we see the very mangled cars and the bloody passengers inside the wreckage (anyone used to the sanitized crime shows of the fifties may be surprised at the realism of M Squad). Then there's the dozens of telling details that are thrown in that make this show special. At one point in episode one, Marvin is discussing the crime with another officer. A very buxom woman strolls by for a very brief moment. She walks by so fast and so close to the camera that we don't even see her face. Without missing a beat or a word of the conversation, Marvin's cold hungry eyes are pulled to the woman's attributes and follow her (them) until she is out of view. It only takes a second (and you will miss it if you aren't paying attention), but that small detail lets us know a lot about Marvin's character: he's virile and lusty underneath all that tough cop hide. We're only 15 minutes into the show and Marvin's character is already a fully developed, three-dimensional figure, There are dozens of small revealing details like that in M Squad that took time to think of and work into the script.
Now on to the audio/video:
It's not as bad as some of the reviews here suggest. Some of the audio is muddy in places (and Lee Marvin tends to be gravel-voiced to begin with), but I could understand everything. It sure isn't digital audio, though! The video is dark in places on some episodes. It's disappointing that this is so, but everything is watchable. I wouldn't bother with it if this was a bad show, but it is so good that I am just delighted to have it at all.",1362528000,5,2188,4.527777777777778

This show must have been really popular in it's day as at the end of one episode during the credits Lee Marvin announces that due to popular demand the album is out of stock but more is on the way to the record stores and thanks the viewer for their patronage. If anyone remembers ""Police Squad"" that would  then be turned into the Naked Gun movies this is the series that they are ripping off including it's theme music heard in the Naked Gun movies. The only reason I have given it four stars instead of five, and I really wanted to give this five stars,is because of the picture quality. Up to now, I've been really lucky with Timeless DVD's. But here I can see what some of the reviewers have been talking about. There is a milky white film over the night time exterior shots. The picture is still watchable but if you don't like this and want pristine images stay clear. I would rather have this show than not to have seen it at all. But it is up to you to decide. Timeless Media Group does announce this at the beginning of each DVD.This is the best prints they could get.

3549443,5,B001ECP576,"Old black & white TV series are not for everyone, especially if HD picture quality is a high priority. But if your viewing preferences are all about the atmosphere, the characters, the plot, and the music; M-Squad is a must have!
M-Squad was the basis for Police Squad, the short-lived detective series spoof starring Leslie Nielsen in the 1980's.
Yes, the picture quality varies considerably, and it is rarely excellent, but it is always perfectly watchable. There are very few episodes that one even fixates on the video quality. What does grab the viewer immediately is the raw, brutal but very human qualities of Detective Frank Ballinger (Lee Marvin), and the extreme gritiness of the often snow-covered 1950's Chicago urban landscape. This is a formula series-the intro never changes, but the story begins immediately with no fluff, and the Detective begins his investigation within a minute or two into the episode. Lee Marvin does his own fight scenes, and like all police heroes, is incredibly lucky to not get hit by bullets during the almost obligatory gunfire scene toward the end of the show. He is also an excellent marksman, being able to engage in a shootout with the crook,but never killing him-something that rarely happens in the real world. The plots are tight, with an unusually high number of women involved in the crime stories, even as the perpetrators.
At the incredibly low price this Timeless Media Group set is selling for, it is nearly worth it just for the bonus Music From M-Squad CD, let alone 15 DVDs in a really quality packaged set.
Get it while it lasts, and then pass it on to a friend or colleaque. They will never make anything like this again.",1324512000,5,1683,4.826989619377162

Many of those who loved the ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",1323734400,,746,5.1652892561983474

Do you go into a bookstore with old books and complain about the pages not being new? Given the chance to have a perfect print using the technology that you babble about and a washed out or faded look I'll take the latter. The outfits and the style from the fifties is so beautiful. You don't see morons with baggy jeans and tatoos and the crap style that people wear today. Women were feminine and dressed classy,the cars were awesome and the interior shots were simple and noncluttered. There is no swearing are the lingo was interesting. No gruesome scenes or images.

They don't make tv series like this anymore, this makes today's tv in my opinion junk. From the jazzy score, to the bad guy's who were truly bad, to the cute chicks with the 24' waist lines, this show packed more action, plot line and great characters into a half hour than today's one hour dramas. Only Lee Marvin could place his stamp on this unique detective crime series,as police Detective Lt. Frank Ballinger, cool, tough and compassionate. And lets not forget Paul Newland as his boss Capt. Grey, the veteran cop, who's seen it all and is unfazed by any circumstances. The exteriors were shot in my hometown of Chicago,I remember some the stores you see in certain scenes that are no longer there and the landmark downtown locations. I bought the dvd collection from Amazon because a local tv station began to show the episodes at 10:00pm, but I would fall asleep on some of them and I needed to be in bed anyway. As  mentioned in earlier reviews some of the quality of the episodes are similar to recorded VHS tape at ep speed but, thank God the show was recovered at all.

You still get a lot for your money.  I think the episodes got  better and better as the show went on.  I am currently into my second season of this TV crime show from the '50s, and have really enjoyed it.

In fact, after about 5-7 episodes the stories really kick in and you almost get addicted to watching.  Part of that is the unpredictability of star Lee Marvin's character, ""Det. Frank Ballinger.""  You never know if Ballinger is going to mess up along the way, even though the crimes are always solved. He's a good cop, and a legitimate tough guy, but he doesn't always do the smart thing, so it's fun to see what jam he gets into every ""week.""

Lee Marvin is excellent in this role; nice to see him playing one of the good guys for a change.  This show is a neglected classic; hopefully more people will discover it and enjoy it themselves.  Highly recommended.",1258675200,6,430,4.863013698630137
3549458,4,B001ECP576,"I just started viewing the M-Squad multi-Pak, watching the show's first episode - ""The Golden Look.""  I was looking forward to this DVD set as I had only sketchy memories of the show as it went off the air when I was three.  I think WGN-TV in Chicago might have re-run the series in the early 1960s and I caught a few episodes then.

The intro warns you that the digitizers of the series had only somewhat beat-up film stock to work with (guess those guys at AFI wanting to make soft copies of all those old flicks weren't blowing smoke, so to speak).  All in all, the copy quality is better than a lot of 1930s and 1940s flicks that survive on TV that weren't deemed ""great works"" with prime vault copies that could be mastered to DVD.

Anyway, what I saw of the first episode was wet my appetite for the rest.  Lee Marvin plays Lt. Frank Ballinger, part of the omnibus M-Squad of the Chicago Police.  This edition has Ballinger tracking down the lone survivor of a stick-up gang that killed three guards at an armored car office, then killed a father and son in a car collision during the get-away.

SPOILER ALERT

When Ballinger finally tracks the baddie to a merchant ship on Lake Michigan, there is no Miranda warning, only a fist sandwich from Marvin (hey, this was 1957).

 I was surprised to find Bruce Gordon (yes, Frank Nitti on ""The Untouchables"") playing an Eisenhower-era CSI in this episode.  The show edits in location shots of Marvin in Chicago (see NYPD Blue four decades later in The Big Apple) to provide the illusion that Hollywood back lot streets are the Windy City.  Seeing Chicago in those location shots from 50 years ago is like stepping out of a time machine.  A Drake Hotel appears in one scene, but with no John Hancock building nearby.  Ballinger walks under El Tracks in the Loop, surrounded by signage that appears to have been hanging there since before D-Day.

If you like 1950s detectives with a refreshingly Draconian sense of justice, who slam down black coffees while chasing leads on rotary-dial phones with a Lucky Strikes hanging from their lips, this show is for you.  If you want to see where an actor earned his chops before starring roles in ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""Point Blank"" this is your puppy.

Finally, if you like a glimpse of times your parents or grandparents told you about, add this to your collection.",1254009600,8,2357,4.558194774346793
3549459,3,B001ECP576,"Ok, first the bad: Not only are the best of the episodes (imagewise) not restored, but some of worst are of poor video quality. M Squad was an important police drama of the late 50's - early 60's and you would think that NBC Universal would put some money into restoration efforts.  Shows of the same era -- such as Perry Mason and Naked City look excellent by comparison.  But the DVDs are better than nothing and for the price---you are getting 117 twenty-five minute episodes plus a fabulous audio CD of the jazz music from the series.  Count Basie wrote the show's opening theme (for the second and third seasons) and other jazz greats contributed to the show's music.

Although Lee Marvin had appeared in numerous feature films prior to this series, you can see why this show made him a star. He had that rough and tumble, no-nonsense screen presence as Detective Lt. Frank Ballinger.  Twenty-five minutes doesn't give a lot of opportunity for plot development, so there's a quite a bit of fast paced action--not a lot of talk, but a lot of shooting first and asking questions later.

But it is an interesting relic of the past and there is the pleasure of watching early performances for a lot of actors who went on to stardom:  Charles Bronson, Mike Connors, Burt Reynolds, Tom Loughlin, Angie Dickenson, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelly, Ed Nelson, etc.  Plus a lot of obscure character actors who are immediately recognizable as staples of TV for the next thirty years.

Although exteriors where shot in Chicago, most of the time the stories were filmed on the back lots in Hollywood, so the production values don't really match up with the Naked City.  But all in all, the DVD is money well spent for an enjoyable time.",1253404800,10,1726,4.666666666666667

I can understand poor video if the source is poor 16mm film source. Some prints look to be early studio tape. But Timeless could have balanced the contrast and brightness in preparing for mastering these DVDs. I have to stop some times at the beginning and switch to two special video modes I set up for watching M Squad only.  Some shows lack contrast, some are too bright and some are both lacking contrast and are too bright. It is clear that no time was spent in prepping these for release. If I can improve the picture with my TV settings, Timeless could have done so before release. It is no fun trying to watch 3 in a row. Timeless did a good job with The Restless Gun and Cimmaron City but they completely botched it here. Now I can't trust them anymore. I wonder about Wells Fargo, especially as it is also over priced. On the plus side, I won't be blasting through these too quick. It there was an award for inconsistency in production values I would nominate Timeless Media over VCI, Alpha, Mill Creek or Critics Choice.
