2887446,3,B000SM6FI6,"I love core work and was very excited about this DVD. Unfortunately the workout did not live up to my expectations.

The production is professional and the instructor is pleasant. The setting is inside a studio and two yoginis show modifications, one for beginners and one for advanced yogis. The workout is well chaptered into three approx. 10 minute sections and one would think they'd make great add-ons... but they don't. That's because not much happens in those 10 minutes. There's a lot of talking and not enough workout. The poses are repeated maybe two or three times and they don't flow together which creates a stop/start feel to each practice.

The instructor usually pauses between poses to explain what's coming next. For that reason this would make a great beginners' practice. But advanced beginners and beyond will probably find it dull. There is one fun pose that I haven't seen before. If I recall correctly, the instructor calls it ""bear"" and it's a flow from chair to airplane. Unfortunately, that's the only highlight, at least for me.

If you are not an absolute beginner and are looking for a core yoga routine that is challenging and fun then there are much better ones available.

2887447,4,B000SM6FI6,"This is my second Prevention video; first was the more traditional floorwork -toning ""Abs Advantage"" with Chris Freytag.  I like that one also but as anyone who uses exercise videos knows, you can't stick with the same routine for long.  You gotta try something new occasionally just for the sake of variety.  I had never done yoga before and thought, well, provided it works my abs, let's give it a shot.

First, full disclosure: I'm a 50 year old male who has been steadily engaged in fitness since '85.  I did standard aerobic classes until Feb '06  and since then have been ""on my own,"" doing cardio at the company gym (stairclimber) and garnishing with daily home video workouts of various types.  I am heavily habituated to exercise and suppose my primary reasons are health and vanity.  Cue up the overlooked-classic Sparks song here, ""I Wish I Looked a Little Better"" featuring the immortal couplet, ""I went to high school and majored in looking real bad, I got a real ugly mom & a real ugly dad""...

As someone who has been male for a half century I can say with some authority that sleek abs are the single attribute we most aspire to, and finding a technique that yields some results is worth reporting.  Of course the caveat must always ALWAYS follow that proper nutrition and careful participation are of paramount importance as well, ESPECIALLY for beginners who could indeed hurt themselves painfully by overdoing or carelessly flinging themselves into any exercise video.  Exercise is NOT punishment!  You will not be able to sustain self inflicted punishment for long!  Take it EASY!

Because there is no complex ankle-busting choreography or sense of rhythm needed to do yoga, this could be an excellent place to start for anyone who wishes to ""ease into"" exercise in the privacy of your own home.  Like my other Prevention video, this one is split into bite-sized 10 minute segments so you can get at least SOMETHING in every morning or whenever it's convenient.  I STRONGLY encourage you to try to get the full warm-up and all three sections in for the full experience & benefit.

As is true of most exercise videos I've encountered, the competency of the instructor & the production qualities are HIGH.  Desiree Bartlett clearly knows yoga & fitness, and understands the need to ""talk through"" sections to keep you engaged in the workout while your eyes must (frequently) be away from the screen as you move through the poses.  Naturally this will be less important as you gain familiarity with the routines, but this is matters A LOT early on, when you're new to the entire practice of yoga (or exercise) and are trying to catch on.  As is true of most exercise videos you also have to be prepared to meet the instructor halfway in accepting her oppressively sunny demeanor as genuine (which it usually mostly is).  Consider after all, how well motivated would you be to follow an apathetic or surly fitness instructor?

The critical question is always, ""does it work""? YES.  Despite my years of dedicated grinding away and what surely must pile up to be tens of thousands of crunches, I have never truly achieved the washboard abs that would swoon the fair sex into a daze of erotic supplication.  And, well, after only a few weeks of Better Belly Yoga, I still haven't.  However, I think this is a DIFFERENT and BETTER approach that has indeed rendered visible results.  One tangible consequence of normal aging is a noticeable loss of flexibility, and it's as much of the stretching and holding of poses that appealed to me in yoga as opposed to conventional floorwork and toning.

This to me is important and makes a big difference. Stretching and sustaining the lower back and hamstring stretches--along with the related tendons and ligaments--is in my opinion wildly overlooked in ""body sculpting"" and training in general.  GENTLY reacclimating your body to the suppleness & elasticity you had while growing up will give you the ability to stand, sit, and walk easier, with better posture and generally a better mental attitude--it is all good.  But remember as in many other things, the tortoise wins this race-easy does it and only persistence over weeks will get you there.  But I CAN promise you that if you stick with this, the rewards you'll (quickly) begin to see will be self-reinforcing and will invigorate your desire to continue and see how far you can go with this.

A couple of gripes.  WHY exactly is yoga done in bare feet?  I suppose that is just the retained custom as the practice has moved out of India and refined itself since the mid-20th century.  This is not something I can adapt to easily especially not with Winter '07 closing in on me. I do not think my experience is diminished by doing the workout in my New Balances.  Second: I respect the Indian names for the poses, but give us some print versions so we can properly relay them in print forums.  Yeah, I know everything is theoretically a mouse click or two away, but would it be such an effort to throw the spelling of the traditional salutation on the screen, or the chataranga (slow descent to your mat from a push-up position) up for us to fully internalize correctly?  No big deal but worth considering the next time the curriculum gets updated.

I am still not widely experienced in the world of exercise video, however with only a couple exceptions, the ones I have purchased have been sufficiently challenging, well produced, and adaptable to users at different levels of experience and fitness.  I think the two Prevention videos I've purchased including ""Better Belly Yoga"" rank especially high in all three categories.  I chose to review ""Better BellY Yoga"" because I think this Eastern approach to fitness really comes at self-improvement from a different perspective that can provide some uniquely fruitful benefits for those of us willing to be receptive.  I also would strongly recommend this video to someone totally new to exercise who wants to ""ease in"" privately but doesn't know where to start.  Welcome!",1196035200,54,6034,4.807170542635659
2887448,3,B000SM6FI6,"I like this workout fairly well.  It's a good place to begin when you're new to Yoga, but I found the workouts a little less intense than what I was looking for, and a little shorter too.",1195948800,5,187,4.054054054054054
2887449,5,B000SM6FI6,"Three 10 minute segments for yoga moves for your belly.  The moves are easy to do - meaning you don't injure yourself.  It's also very relaxing.  Instructions are given that a person who never did yoga could also follow.  If you have back issues, this may help as your back also benefits from the moves.",1194566400,14,303,4.454545454545454

The first day I got the video, I did all three segments. It is extremely relaxing but the day after you can definitely tell you worked out your stomach! I would highly recommend this product.",1192060800,21,357,4.59375
2887451,5,B000SM6FI6,"I got this DVD along with a Book and another DVD titled Flat Belly Yoga. I viewed them before I tried them. Tried the Flat Belly Yoga first. I am almost 300 pounds and want to lose my belly, firm it up, and flatten it. Well I have to say I absolutely LOVE this instructor!! She is a very beautiful, calm woman. Very encouraging, makes me feel like she really cares and that helps me.
I would recommend Better Belly Yoga for ANYONE!!

2887454,1,B000SM6FI6,"Buy something else.  Total waste of money of $15.00 for a 36 minute video of stretches you can learn from any where or a more detailed workout video.  It's nothing but strectching,  Complete waste of money!!",1273276800,,207,4.694444444444445
2887455,4,B000SM6FI6,"I really like this DVD (Prevention has a good line - especially the ones with Chris Freytag).  It's slightly challenging, but easy enough so that beginners to yoga won't feel overwhelmed.  I love DVDs that break it into smaller workouts in case you are short on time and can only do one or two of the 10-minute workouts.  There is an advanced modification as well as a beginner's modification, so the workout caters to all levels.  I usually do the full 30 minutes, and by the end I am very relaxed.",1267660800,2,499,4.450549450549451
2887456,3,B000SM6FI6,"I have used this DVD several times, as it is a good basic yoga workout. I am not sure, however, of the belly part.  I am never sore in my abs from this workout, and she doesn't concentrate on many core moves.  I give it 3 stars only because, like I stated earlier, it is a good basic yoga workout.",1249344000,,297,3.933333333333333
2887457,3,B000SM6FI6,"I bought this because I was excited about the prospect of a yoga routine targeted specifically to the core. However, this is just a basic intro to vinyasas and while it claims to have beginning, intermediate, and advanced postures, the camera rarely ever focuses on the girl doing the advanced forms so how can we follow it? I recommend this DVD to those who want to learn basic yoga postures but not to those already well-versed in yoga. It will frustrate you as she focuses on the beginners, dragging out the routine and slowing me down without offering the option to focus on the advanced. I am giving this to a friend who is new to yoga. I prefer Sara Ivanhoe's 20 Min Yoga Makeover: Flat Abs for a good core workout.",1220745600,8,721,4.46969696969697
2887458,3,B000SM6FI6,"I think the name is deceiving. While the stretches are great as is the instruction, there's WAY too much of it.  Some of my pet peeves with this video are:

Too MUCH time spent on instruction;
Too much repetition;
Too much focus on arms and legs and not enough on core;
Actually BOTHERED my lower back vs. relaxing it

I can't see how this would strengthen your core.  While I realize I have a pretty strong core and a pretty strong, flat lower stomach, even if I didn't I don't see how this would build those muscles. Maybe I'm missing something.  I wouldn't say don't try it, but if you are looking for something closer to a miracle than doing nothing at all, this won't do it.",1204675200,3,679,4.31496062992126
2887459,5,B000SM6FI6,"I bought this dvd a couple of months ago because I love yoga but I also have a belly! This is one of the best workouts I do! Between Pilates and this belly yoga I and can see and FEEL a difference. If you are new to yoga this dvd will teach you the basics... this dvd is very relaxing and your body will feel wonderful. I never buy a workout dvd that is going to take any longer than 45 minutes, this one comes in segments but if you do the whole series it won't be any longer than 45 minutes. Actually Prevention has some of the best work outs in the industry as far as I am concerned.",1202601600,9,586,3.8916666666666666
2887460,3,B000SM6FI6,"Yoga has bee around for thousands of years & can ease/heal many health issues... burning fat/calories is the least that it does. This is another Westernized/aerobicized version of a deeper/beneficial physical healing session.
There is only chapter choices & choice of instruction w/ or w/o music. The music is the usual fast beat elevator music of most fitness videos that are meant to be soothing.
Set the usual hardwood floor & lighted wall stage w/one woman showing the beginner & the other advanced, Desire Bartlett leads a toning/calorie killer emphasized easy paced yoga workout. As another reviewer said, with Desiree taking her time telling you what's coming next, you are standing there resting, those who aren't beginners will get bored. I found her lack of instruction on dangers of injury if done incorrectly disturbing like most Westernized yoga. Yes, you can move your body w/o knowing you should turn your head a certain way, but if repeated, you may cause strain or a neck ache over time if you don't listen to the discomfort when you do a pose incorrectly. She also will take time say showing a move that is considered intermediate, like standing hand to foot balancing (utthita Hasta Padangusthasana A) first explaining how the beginner does it w/a belt & then the advanced which is a big time eater.
Warm-up - 5 min
Sun salutations -  mountain, standing side bends, standing fwd bend, downward dog, plank, chaturanga, cobra.
Series I - 10 min - Standing poses - down dog, cobra, knee to nose stretch a few times, crescent, standing hand to foot balancing
Series 2 - 10 min
Mountain, chair, bear (chair deeper w/airplane arms), standing fwd bend, down dog, chaturanga, up dog, warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, side angle, chaturanga, up dog, down dog, warrior poses & side angle again (explained in length), plank, up dog, down dog, same thing AGAIN but w/a variation added of ""sunrise sunset""(warrior 2 w/raised arms & a torso side bend, interesting but didn't feel it), boat (w/arms pointed fwd together & torso twists), down dog, standing fwd bend, mountain.
Series 3 - 10 min
Mountain, standing fwd bend, plank, chaturanga, updog, down dog, siting straight leg fwd bend, lie down, pilates roll ups, reclined knees to side spinal twist (WINDOW WIPERS she calls them?), spine rocking, reverse plank/up facing plank, table, sitting spinal sage twist, bridge, reclined knee to side spinal twist (again & held longer), sitting torso side bend.

I disliked the style of this w/it's repeating of poses & never holding it long enough to allow the muscles to stretch. With this style, she doesn't have the time to give more then limited explanations on how to do the poses for beginners. It is a good toning workout for those who are beginners & don't like the more spiritual, authentic yoga. Those with muscle/joint limitations would be better off finding a beginner yoga video w/more instruction on how to avoid injury unlike this one.

Ms Bartlett explains each move and shows different levels. Advanced, medium and beginner. Her explanation and instruction of each move makes me feel confident. The other CDs rushed me along and half the time I knew I wasn't doing the poses right but couldn't follow along. Now I follow along and try to push myself just a little at a time to see if I can do the poses better. I am so excited to finally have a beginners yoga program. I will keep the other programs becasue I feel strongly that after learning from Ms Bartlett that I will soon be able to do those well too.
