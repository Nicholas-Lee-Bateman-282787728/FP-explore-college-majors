2664294,2,B000IY0CGK,"I was looking for a good visual instruction on inline skating. I am very disappointed by this DVD. The video has a home-made quality, which is not my major complaint. The content is more about a few skating tips rather than a thorough instruction from beginner skills to more advanced ones. I am a beginner, that is why I need good instructions. Some techniques such as A-turn, parallel turn, spin stop, scissors are not covered at all. The ones  that do get mentioned, such as cross-over turn, the instructor does not provide information on where you should put your weight, what mistakes a beginner would typically make. Instead, he just shows you a few times. And that is it. So, if you want to watch a few minutes of a very good speed inline skater skates and shows you a few tips here and there, this video may be good for you. But if you are looking for a thorough instructional video, this is definitely not.",1183939200,21,915,4.5120481927710845
2664295,5,B000IY0CGK,"This video is not comprehensive of skating skills, but combined with a good instruction book, you will do very well.  The techniques are unique and effective.  I really got a lot out of the heel brake instruction.  Now, I can really apply that brake!",1178409600,3,250,4.636363636363637
2664296,5,B000IY0CGK,"This DVD is great!  Excellent instruction that will take you from just beginning all the way to cross-over turns.  Highly recommended.  If you want to learn to skate correctly, get this video.",1177545600,,192,4.9375
8147784,5,B000IY0CGK,"clear , simple , enough to follow in a systematic way and you make it ! I enjoy in line skate now",1383782400,,97,3.4545454545454546
8147785,5,B000IY0CGK,"A very straight forward presentation of basic, intermediate and advanced concepts that are not as effectively presented in any other books and videos I've looked at. It appears to be from the perspective of a speed skater but is not unusable for all skaters to improve on your most fundamental approach to getting from A to B, braking, turning, etc. He's a bit repetitive but it's all to stress his points which he does well. The title is misleading - there are much more thorough videos out there with better quality presentations - the Bobby Hull, Jr. is unbeatable. But no where else have I found his unique approach - something all beginners should not miss. Maybe ""The Most Valuable Inline Skating Instructions Ever!""?",1314489600,,723,4.838709677419355
8147786,4,B000IY0CGK,"I found the instructions provided in the video to be quite valuable.

I primarily purchased this video to help me learn to stop correctly as my previous grass stops were counterproductive and the videos I found online were not providing me with adequate or detailed instruction. As a novice inline skater who has had experience ice skating and skiing, I was under the misguided impression the parallels were few. I'm pleased to learn that the three sports share a greater number of commonalities than initially thought. I'm equally pleased to report that I have learned to stop correctly and a few other things I can't wait to put into practice.

For a time, I left skiing and skating behind when I left my New England birthplace for the southeast but recently decided to return to one and add in this comparable sport. For me, the instructions provided were well worth the price because it affords me the opportunity to practice and review skills at my leisure and follow-up with an instructor should that prove necessary.

This video, in conjunction with Get Rolling by Liz Miller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Rolling-the-Beginner-s-Guide-to-In-line-Skating-Third-Edition/dp/0963219634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Rolling, the Beginner's Guide to In-line Skating, Third Edition</a>&nbsp;has been extremely beneficial in building my confidence to my `new found' sport.

While the production isn't theater quality, the value remains present and certainly works for me.",1277942400,,1521,5.776785714285714
8147787,3,B000IY0CGK,"Steve Bishop's instructional video hardly merits its pretentious title.  For sure his careful explanation and breakdown showing a slalom approach to controlling speed on downhill slopes and inclines (""staying ahead, not behind, gravity""), and his mantra for developing an excellent forward stride technique (""Stomp on it and stand on it""), are excellent.  In addition, his ""Squeeze ze knees"" presentation for using the rubber foot brake, where you bend forward over your center of gravity and bring the knees together with ""muscular force,"" offers beginners greater safety and stability in stopping than the standard straight up with a ""vertical back"" and feet apart method.  But there's no mention of the various spin or lunge stops, ""A-frame turns"" and ""swizzle"" techniques which develop the necessary foot control for ""carving"" and inside or outside wheel edging.  Yes, his video provides good basics for getting up and moving, and stopping, but little else.",1258934400,3,961,5.429530201342282
8147788,4,B000IY0CGK,Good video and step by step procedure...my suggestion is to do some roller skating before starting with the in line skating lessons...the video ensures that all bones are intact:),1235952000,,179,5.206896551724138
8147789,2,B000IY0CGK,"I ordered this video over a year ago, and while I think the instructor had some very good intentions; I think people should know what this video is however. It is an amateur video with background noise shot at public locations. More than that, I'm a technical person so I had hoped for more detail and discussion about common errors and what to avoid.

This tape had some good skating tips, but it's certainly not the best skating instructions ever.",1217635200,,449,4.6125
8147790,4,B000IY0CGK,"There is alot you can knock about this DVD, home made, does not cover everything,but the acid test of wether it will make you a better skater if you are just starting out, or want to improve your technique, the answer is yes. As with all instructional DVD, it will not replace one to one tutor, but if that is not available, this is a good second choice.",1205280000,,354,4.220588235294118
8147791,1,B000IY0CGK,"This DVD was a disappointment. I expected more. The skills taught are certainly useful, but the instructor seemes to be barely capable himself. Much more material should be covered for the price.",1203206400,2,195,5.125
8147792,2,B000IY0CGK,"Good video to watch for a intermediate to advanced skater. There is too much to cover in how to skate properly. There was not enough time given to braking on skates. This video is best for those who are already comfortable how to stop confidently because he does not give too much time explaining all the beginner concepts and foundations.

I would not expect a beginner to be able to go down a hill like the instructor.",1200355200,8,420,4.454545454545454
8147793,5,B000IY0CGK,Steve Reed took me from a fallen down beginner to a confident skater in a just a few weeks. I can still hear his voice whenever I skate. It's like he is skating with me. Super video. Thanks Steve,1196467200,,195,4.0256410256410255
