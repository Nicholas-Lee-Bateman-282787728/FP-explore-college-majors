Needless to say, drastic cuts in the plot are necessary to scale Dickens's novel down to the length of a short film, but thanks to clumsy script-writing and editing, the plot is not very clear for children. There's surely a better way to initiate kids to this story.",1235433600,,366,4.919354838709677
