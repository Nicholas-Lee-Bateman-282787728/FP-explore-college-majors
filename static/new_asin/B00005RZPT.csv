1658129,5,B00005RZPT,"Release #7 in the releases of Cardcaptor Sakura. This one is being released along with volume 4. Now if pioneer would only release volume monthly. Anyway, the cover is fantastic featuring a green background and Sakura in her cute ""Alice in Wonderland"" look. Thanks to pioneer to releasing covers in other colors besides pink (4 are enough for now)
The episodes are great as always. I'm not clear on what the insert and postcard are at the moment, but it's really not that important.
*Sakura finds out if you meet someone that looks like you, then you may die soon. That's a little harsh, especially when a clow card is damaging her image. Sakura may not be dying, but for, Touya, it could be a possibility! Can she rescue him from the unknown card?
*A new beautiful teacher shows up to teach math. Shaoran gets a weird vibe from her though. Meanwhile, Sakura and Meilin race to the Tsukimine shrine to get charms when a clow card creates a maze to end all mazes. Everyone has lost all hope of finding the exit! Did you just hear that bell?
*Touya seems to know Kaho Mizuki from somewhere. Is there anyway to find out what happened? A clow card that merges with a cherry tree seem to think so. Sakura is trapped in the past! Shaoran, do something!
*Twin bells gets new cards in that look very similar to clow cards. It would just be awful if a real one got mixed in with them! A dangerous card appears and Sakura and Shaoran doesn't know who has it! Will they find the poor unfortunate ""Brat"" before he/she says the name on the card to release it?
Remember, this release is in Japanese with English subtitles. Until March, unless Pioneer starts releasing them sooner! Release!",1005868800,17,1675,4.531353135313531
1658130,5,B00005RZPT,"Cardcaptor Sakura rocks! The order of the episodes may be messed up, but they are great. The episodes are Mirror, Maze, Return, and Shot. These episodes are great in english, so the sould be better in Japanese. They are some of my favorite episodes. You sould get them if you are a Cardcaptor Sakura fan. There is Shyaoron, Tomoyo, Sakura, and Meiling in these episodes. But wait for the great episodes to appear and don't buy the lousy ones that are cheap. CCS ROCKS!",1005350400,,468,4.583333333333333

7952915,4,B00005RZPT,"Cardcaptor Sakura, Vol. 7: Magical Mystery contains four episodes of the magical adventures of a young girl named Sakura as she tries to recapture ancient cards that have escaped.  Joining her in her search are her friend Tomoyo, who videotapes Sakura's battles as well as construct's Sakura's battle costumes, a tiny winged animal named Kero who claims to be the guardian of the cards, and her rivals Li Shaoran and Meilin, who are from Hong Kong.

Episode 25: Two Sakuras - Sakura's doppelganger is wreaking havoc downtown - and ruining her reputation!  There is a legend that if you see your doppelganger, you will die.  Is this a Clow Card or the end of Sakura?

Episode 26: Sakura and the Wonderful Teacher -  Sakura wakes up early from a mysterious and beautiful dream.  She decides to take advantage of the time, and go for an early walk to school.  As she is enjoying herself outside, she runs into an enchanting and beautiful woman.  Sakura is infatuated.  At school, the woman is her substitute math teacher!  Li is not as infatuated, however.  He senses great power from Ms. Mizuki.

Later that day, on the way to a shrine to buy a charm, Sakura and her friends are trapped in the Maze card.  Each time they try to escape, the maze compensates.  Will they die inside?

Episode 27: Sakura and the Shrine of Memories - Toya and Mizuki sensei have a past! Sakura gets sucked into the past by a Clow Card to witness it all - but how will she get back to the present time?

Episode 28: Sakura and the Enchanted Cards - Viewers will be happy to see the Twin Bells toy and gift shop with it's gracious owner.  The shop is selling ""enchanted cards,"" which are on various things like diet, cooking, romance.  The cards quickly catch on, but it seems a real Clow Card - a dangerous attack one - got mixed up in them.  Can Sakura or Li get to it before it targets someone?

The DVD has an art gallery with a beautiful image of ""mirror,"" the prettiest Clow Card I have seen so far.",1115769600,4,1980,4.444444444444445
7952916,5,B00005RZPT,Lots of confusing things happen when you hit volume 7 of this wonderful series. Most of all you realize that Sakura has a lot more going on around her than she realizes. Miss Kaho Mitsuki first shows up in episode 26 of this DVD which along with all the rest of the episodes in this collection are some of the best and most dramatic in the series. This DVD whets my appetite for the next upcoming volume Cardcaptor Sakura:Sweet Trouble...,1015459200,,438,4.4875
7952917,5,B00005RZPT,"""Sakura and Another Sakura,"" ""Sakura and the Wonderful Teacher,"" ""Sakura and the Shrine of Memories"" and ""Sakura and the Incantation Cards"" are four Card Captor Sakura episodes you won't want to miss! They show a lot of the series' character development and backstory, which is why I consider these four some of the best episodes.
 First, there's ""Sakura and Another Sakura."" A copy of Kinomoto Sakura is running around Tomoeda District causing trouble. Yanagisawa Naoko, always first to offer a scary tale she's heard (much to the chagrin of ghost-fearing Sakura), remembers a saying that if you see your exact double in real life, you die. However, as Sakura-chan learns to tell fortunes with her Clow Cards, she realizes that she isn't the one that this spirit is out to harm...
 Next, in ""Sakura and the Wonderful Teacher,"" the kind yet mysterious Mizuki Kaho-sensei, a miko (shrine maiden) who seems to know Sakura's older brother Touya, comes to teach math at Tomoeda Elementary. Li Syaoran thinks she seems suspicious, but Sakura counters that she seems nice enough. Meiling, Syaoran's self-proclaimed fiancee, takes Sakura and her best friend, Daidouji Tomoyo, to Kaho's shrine to buy charms, and she manages to drag Syaoran along, too. They get caught in a mysterious green maze, and Sakura's cards, Syaoran's spells, and anything else they try can't seem to get the group out of the maze... until help arrives from an unexpected source!
 In ""Sakura and the Shrine of Memories,"" we return to Kaho's shrine because Kero-chan, the cards' guardian, can sense a card there. Sakura and Syaoran can't seem to find it anywhere- until Sakura gets sucked into a giant tree! The Return card, having taken up residence at the tree, has pulled Sakura back to her brother Touya's junior high days, where it is discovered that he did know Kaho before she returned to Tomoeda recently. Sakura can't spend all the time from then until the present in the tree, can she? How will she escape?
 In this video's final episode, ""Sakura and the Incantation Cards,"" Twin Bells, a local store, has begun to stock strange cards that look similar to Clow Cards and supposedly give you more confidence and power. Sakura is going to buy a ""Cooking Card,"" but they are sold out. However, she and Syaoran have a more important matter to think about: one of their classmates has bought a REAL card!
 Overall, I think these four episodes show a lot of character development and backstory, and are real staples to the series.
 ""Next time too, together with Sakura, release!""",1013731200,9,2549,4.916279069767442
7952918,3,B00005RZPT,"I am very fond of this series and enjoy the original unbutchered version of Card Captor Sakura, viewed as Clamp/Mad House intended it to be. Unfortunately I must make a technical bulletin about this title: if you have a hardware setup like mine, where the computer isn't capable of DVD-ROM playback and you have a DVD player patched into a TV card, you are going to get bad video quality from this title.  Purples and pinks (colors that occur frequently in the CCS color balance) are distorted particularly badly. I was very disappointed, considering that art and presentation are significant parts of Japanese animation.
Sakura discovers she has a mischievious twin that is actually the mirror card.  The card makes a beeline for Sakura's brother.  Can she tame this card in time?  There's a new teacher on the block.  Li doesn't like her but when the maze card traps Li and Sakura in a maze the instructor's help must be graciously accepted.  Then there's the shrine of memories but I'll save that one for the viewer becuase it's rather memorable.  Finally there's that card shop selling cards.  They wouldn't be clow cards, would they?  Nah, they couldn't possibly be clow cards...  Or maybe...",1013040000,2,1197,4.852216748768473
7952919,5,B00005RZPT,"Another wonderful addition to the DVD lineup for this series! We get one episode the dub missed, and three it didn't with multiple scenes that were cut regardless.
  First up, the capture of the Mirror Card, which turns itself into a replica of Sakura herself and badly hurts Toya! Though this ep. was in the dub, it's worth it for the scenes that got cut, such as Sakura getting a quick trim from Yukito!
  Second, Miss Kaho Mitsuki(Ms. Mackenzie in the dub) arrives just in time to help the kids defeat the trap of the Maze Card. This ep. also made the dub.
  Third, we have an ep that didn't make the dub! The capture of the Return Card on the shrine owned by Miss Mitsuki's family! But before they find it, Sakura is suddenly sent three to five years back in time, when Toya was still in Junior High! There she learns how he knew Miss Mitsuki. Also, we have an interesting conversation between Sakura and Li about their feelings toward Yukito.
  Finally, we have the adventure of the Shot Card! Though this was in the dub, I recommend viewing it because there are bits the dub skipped. For instance, we get to see Meilin buy a ""Love"" card from amongst the ""enchanted"" cards at Twin Bells in the hopes of strengthening Li's affections for her, and the whole subplot of Sakura trying to learn to cook Croquets got cut as well!(Her problem was that she was afraid of being hit by the popping oil.) This episode also shows Meilin's first meeting with Yukito, and the reason for the Shot Card attacking Li makes far more sense!(In the Japanese the card was set to go off when it was told to shoot at something. Meilin's trues coment that tripped it was, ""I'll use the magic of this enchanted card to make a shot directly at Shaoron's heart!"" oops.)
  Bring on the next disc!
