8476061,5,B005JW5H6G,"The DVD worked after changing the region for the DVD player.  I also needed to install VLC software.  I suggest purchasing a second DVD which is set up for Region 2 video, since the number of changes to region is limited. The video quality was excellent, and it was well produced.  The newer videos are even better.",1466899200,,315,4.491228070175438
