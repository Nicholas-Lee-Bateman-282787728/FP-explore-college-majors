8346270,2,B001VG2MEE,"I am hugely disappointed with this product.

Athough some material is obviously interesting, the poor quality of the production and particularly the sound is so atrocious that it detracts completely from what occurs on the screen.  No creative thought, let alone love for Sinatra's genius went into the making of this and much of it views like a gossip magazine.

No effort was made to engage the viewer and far too often the upper part of the screen was simply cut off, leaving only half the heads of the performers. But, all said and done, the really objectionable feature is the constant duplication of material, with the result that very little original material is actually presented.  In other words, almost every disc rehashes identical images and music.

Furthermore:  The choice of films that are finally included, are most certainly not necessarily the most interesting. ""The man with the golden arm"" is good but ""Sounder"" really should have been left on the shelf.

Considering the wealth of material that is readily available, I consider it disgusting that so little effort went into producing something that could quite easily have been a marvellous experience for everyone concerned.

The price of the postage renders it unattractive to return this compilation, which I would otherwise most certainly have done.

For anyone interested in purchasing this:  DON'T!
