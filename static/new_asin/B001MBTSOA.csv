8320843,5,B001MBTSOA,"In the mid-sixties, Hammer was looking to find new monsters to add to its continuing cycles of old monsters mostly drawn from Universal's original ""monster movies"" begun in the thirties.  So, Hammer came up with two unique ideas which became 1964's ""The Gorgon"" released by Columbia (and available on DVD in their ""Icons of Horror"" set) which starred Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in bringing a Greek mythological ""monster"" who turned her victims into stone, and also 1966's ""The Reptile"" distributed by 20th Century-Fox and starring Noel Willman, Jennifer Daniel (who had a starring role in Hammer's ""Kiss of the Vampire""), Jacqueline Pearce and Michael Ripper which brought a completely new ""monster"" of a snake-like creature who poisoned her victims with a bite that had the villagers attribute to a wave of the ""black plague"" until the protagonists look beyond the superstitions of the locals in a Victorian Cornish village.  The special effects of the monster make-up of ""The Reptile"" serve the film better than the end result of ""The Gorgon"" with the monster appearing more frightening.  In both films, the monster is shown only fleetingly a few times, but in ""The Gorgon"" for the film-makers it is a relief as the special effects make-up is rather poor for an otherwise good horror film.  ""The Reptile"", written by Hammer's John Elder and directed by John Gilling, who the year before directed another Hammer ""masterpiece,"" ""Plague of the Zombies"" (which I have not yet seen, but which I understand gives George Romero's zombies a run for the money).  Anchor Bay has released this edition with a few extras and trailers.",1329436800,2,1631,5.048327137546468
8320844,1,B001MBTSOA,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

The movie had this been a genuine product released through Anchor Bay would've received 5 stars.

I threw my money away on:

Dracula Prince Of Darkness

Frankenstein Created Woman

The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires

Save your money until somebody with half a brain decides to do the right things with the old deleted Hammer titles. I'm still very dissatisfied with this scenario.",1260316800,4,1640,4.592465753424658
