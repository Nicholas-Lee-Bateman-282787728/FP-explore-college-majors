8171346,5,6300174247,"THis is one of the best stretching video s I have done. After you do this video you will feel relaxed and filled with great energy. This is part of the 1986 Esquire Great Body series which features Deborah Crocker  as the insructor. Most people do not now about the original great body series ans how great they are. This is one of the best with Deborah leading you through a series of traditional stretches,yoga poses,and deep mediation breathing to make you fell great. It has some challenging stretches but deb shows you how to modify the moves to make them easier and most important make you fell great. The whole video times up to abot 30 minutes whic is great for anybody who s on the go and wants a great yoga workout. It is also great to do after any aerobic or strength training tape for an extra cool down to make you feel great. And of course it is great to do by itself for a great yoga workout. It is of course dated with leg warmers and 80s hair but the music is quite modern and refreshing,it goes along great with the workout. So you will not be very aggitated by the music. For any body who has done yoga before and found it way to challenging should go for this video they will found it great for them. Anybody who is a pro at yoga will love this video to because it shows you how to make the exercises more of a challenge if you are experienced and want a great stretching/yoga workout in 30 minutes. Deborah Crocker is a great instructer she is not annoying and peppy like other intructers you might have done. She goes straight to the point. I highly reccomend this video. Give it a try.",1168819200,13,1608,4.272131147540984
