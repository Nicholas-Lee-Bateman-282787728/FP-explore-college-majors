3531146,5,B001DJ7PVY,THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GAMES IN U-M FOOTBALL HISTORY. I WOULD ENJOY SEEING MOST ALL MICHIGAN GAME WINS ON DVD/B-D; BUT MOSTLY THE ONES BEATING OSU. HOWEVER THIS SAME RIVALRY SERIES MAKES THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER SIMILAR TITLES.  THIS SET IS THE BEST FOR THOSE HAIL TO THE VICTORS INTEREST AND GO BLUE!,1241308800,,318,4.482758620689655
3531147,5,B001DJ7PVY,"This is a great dvd set. It has the complete ABC game broadcasts for each of the 1979, 2002 and 2006 wins over Michigan. Commercials have been removed as has the halftime. The video quality is outstanding on all three games which is especially impressive for the 1979 game. It features the ability to watch the entire game or select specific quarters. Very impressive!!",1233360000,4,369,4.78125
3531148,5,B001DJ7PVY,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, a huge Michigan fan. I was going to order it from the M-Den official store and it was sold out, so I was lucky to find it here. He was super excited! It came quickly in the mail also.",1231200000,3,229,3.893617021276596

8293592,5,B001DJ7PVY,great video from the good ol days of Michigan football,1417478400,,54,4.5
8293593,5,B001DJ7PVY,Great DVD set with perfect picture quality. I especially enjoyed re-watching the 1997 game called by the great Keith Jackson. My only complaint is that they did not include the 2003 game. The 1995 Tim Biakabutuka game was great but the 2003 game was the 100th meeting and we won the Big 10 title while spoiling OSU's chance to play in the BCS title game.,1348790400,,354,4.461538461538462
8293594,5,B001DJ7PVY,"My husband is a big OSU fan, and this Christmas I had no idea what to get him that he didn't already have that didn't cost an arm and a leg of course. Let's just say that when he opened his Christmas gifts, THIS gift was more enjoyed then the main and more expensive one (that wasn't sports related)! He still talks about this DVD to family & friends! Great for any OSU fan!",1325548800,,374,4.0675675675675675
8293595,1,B001DJ7PVY,"I ordered as a gift.  Thankfully I did preview the DVDs to check the quality.  The two early DVDs were ok considering the dates they aired.  The third DVD which was the latest date was terrible.

I did sent an email to the vendor and suggested that the either send me a new copy of the bad DVD or we just replace the entire set. The sad thing is that they have not responded, which is usually not an indicator of good faith and did nothing to ensure customer satisfaction.

I am therefore left with no option other than to return the product.",1324252800,3,542,4.223300970873787

8293597,5,B001DJ7PVY,"I bought this DVD for my fiance's birthday and he loved it. He is a born and bred Buckeye, and he watched it the night he got it.",1265328000,,129,3.642857142857143
8293598,5,B001DJ7PVY,"I knew my husband would love this dvd.  I ordered it for him on Fri, Nov 27, 2009 for $15.38 from Miami Merchandise thru Amazon.  The confirmation came with a delivery estimate date of December 4, 2009 - December 21, 2009.  On Nov 28, I received an email that this order was shipped.  On Dec 14, I sent an inquiry as to whether this was showing it was delivered yet.  I received a reply on Dec 15th from Miami Merchandise that it indeed had been shipped and I should receive it any day.  Without further explanation, I received an email on Dec 20 that I was being refunded for that purchase.
How can you be told it was shipped and suddenly you are refunded.  Obviously, the email saying it was shipped was not truthful!  As far as the DVD, I am certain it is a winner.  As far as the supplier, I would rate them poor.",1262563200,,817,4.185897435897436
