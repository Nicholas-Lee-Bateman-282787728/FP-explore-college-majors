Your quick action on the return of my, SSL 10.1b Car Stereo,for a Replacement was AWESOME !!.But the only downfall ( Was removal of old unit and, Reinstallation of New Stereo !!. ).Which was a Cost of 200.00 EXTRA DOLLARS.Which I should not have to PAY FOR !!.Some kind of Credit or Reinbursment should be in place, for this situation !!?.",1417132800,,348,4.5396825396825395

4237633,1,B00402FGL2,"The 2 disc, 4 movie package has a lot of problems, all centering around the spoken language you want to
hear.
Ronan (the reason I got the set) plays in English without doing anything.
On Blown Away and Harley Davidson, you have to either select which language you want as the movie starts,
or use the menu button on your remote to access the selection process.
For No man's Land, YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK! There is no way to select English spoken through the disc, or your
remote, so what you get is a language I could never figure out, and English subtitles for the whole movie.  In other words,
I did not watch this movie, as it was a waste of space on the disc.
Once you get the spoken English set up, the 3 movies play well.",1407801600,5,723,4.164285714285715

4237636,5,B00402FGL2,"My husband had heard about Harley Davidson and the marlboro man man from a friend and wanted to see it. Since it's not on netflix, I searched on amazon to see how much it would cost to purchase...to my surprise, not only was it very affordable, but it was packaged with 3 other films that my husband had not seen! Great deal, fast shipping, and some good movies.",1398211200,2,362,4.338235294117647
