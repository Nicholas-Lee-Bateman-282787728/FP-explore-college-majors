Unlike many of the  old B&W cowboy movies Outlaw's son has some good acting and a decent storyline.

4663815,4,B005E7SF9M,"For me the westerns from the major studios were a 'Golden Age' of film product. OUTLAW'S SON while a low budget minor studio entry fits in well. The same western stalwarts (Tom London, John Rickard, Lori Nelson) helped newer faces Dane Clark, Ben Cooper, and Ellen Drew in a more psychological store about an estranged father and son. The story and plot mixed well with a different twist on a familiar scene with acting and character development. I enjoyed it immensely. Dane (a favorite) was not  out of place in  western garb. Ben Cooper was a surprise. I saw more than just a juvenile delinquent in his role. And Lori Nelson's character was much more independent and still vulnerable than her other roles (DESTRY with Audie Murphy).",1399334400,,735,4.7795275590551185

4663818,5,B005E7SF9M,"This movie was first released in 1957(2011), in B/W, fullscreen and runs 88 minutes. The sound and picture quality are very good, even though the DVD is made from best material available. There are no extras. The film starts with aunt Ruth telling young Jeff Blaine that he had a visitor in the house. Jeff finds Nate Blaine(DANE CLARK) in the house. Ruth says Nate was Jeff's father who had come home after 12 years. Nate's wife lily had died and Ruth brought up Jeff. The local marshall comes to see what Nate was upto. Nate shows Jeff how to shoot. As Marshall chases Nate out of a saloon, 2 men rob the local bank and kill the manager. Ruth, who was worried that Nate will take Jeff away, claims she saw Nate Blaine rob the bank and kill the manager. Nate is arrested but escapes. Jeff(BEN COOPER), now grown up works with the Marshall as a deputy and likes to have his own ways. When a stagecoach is being robbed, Jeff joins the marshall to tackle the robbers on the rocks. One of the shot robbers recognises Jeff as Nate's boy, and before dying, says that Nate had not robbed the bank or killed the manager. Jeff realises that his aunt Ruth had lied and unnecessary put his father in danger.
This very good story of CLIFTON ADAMS is well photographed by WILLIAM MARGULIES and briskly directed by LESLEY SELANDER. The action scenes are very good and Ben Cooper acts well. But the whole film is Dane Clark, who provides a masterly performance right upto the end of the film.

8467999,5,B005E7SF9M,"I almost didn't watch this movie because of the simple title,  It correctly explains the story line, but it doesn't do the movie justice. ""Outlaw's Son"" was actually based on a Clifton Adams book called ""Gambling Man"" which doesn't do the story justice either, because there is very little
gambling in the movie.

Actor Dane Clark plays Nate Blaine who is a wanted outlaw.  Nate comes to visit his son Jeff Blaine played by actor Ben Cooper.  Nate hasn't seen his 12 year old son since he was 4 months old, and his sister-in-law who raised him isn't happy about it.  Long story short; Nate tries to teach his son how to shoot a gun and things get worse from there. The sister-in-law accuses Nate of killing a man and robbing a bank, which he didn't do, but for the sake of his son, she does it anyway and Nate runs from the law.  The movie then jumps 8 or 10 years into the future when Jeff is a young deputy marshall that get himself into trouble.  He ends up wanting to take the life of an outlaw like his father.

Here are a couple of interesting notes:  Watch very carefully at the very end of the movie when Jeff's father Nate is trying to stop the stage coach that is being robbed by one of his former outlaw buddies.  The stage is racing down the road without a driver, but you can clearly see that the rains from the horses are tucked into a hole in the seat back rest and is being driven by a stunt person inside the coach.  However when someone takes over the rains to control the stage the rains are mysteriously not in the hole any longer, the new driver has to reach down as if the rains were on the floor.  Also, Jeff ends up with one of the two girls he in interested in throughout the entire movie.  Check out the picture below, it's Lila, who is being played by Lori Nelson.",1449014400,,1791,4.232352941176471
