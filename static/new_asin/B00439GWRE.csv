4254678,3,B00439GWRE,"Not a bad film, interesting story, good acting, nothing ground breaking but enjoyed watching it one time.  Better as a rental if you can find it.",1429660800,,145,4.576923076923077
4254679,5,B00439GWRE,"A non-typical love story, with a non-typical ending. Not the usual Hollywood crap. If it were possible, I would award it 4.5 stars.",1369353600,,131,4.739130434782608
4254680,5,B00439GWRE,"Some Voices was WONDERFUL!!!! A sweet movie. A love story on multiple levels. Two bothers finding and losing their lady loves only to find how much they actually love and need each other. Pete objects to his bipolar brother bringing home a girlfriend. Ray (the bipolar Daniel Craig) says to him ""you haven't gotten laid in 5 years and I'm the crazy one!?"". A not to be missed film.",1365379200,4,381,4.536231884057971
4254681,5,B00439GWRE,A very moving story that I wasn't familiar with. A completely different side of Daniel Craig - no sign of Bond here!,1361836800,2,116,4.318181818181818
4254682,5,B00439GWRE,"Some Voices is a very different unconventional love story. Daniel Craig is superb as the enigmatic,mysterious yet endearing Ray. A movie I highly recommend.",1325030400,,156,5.541666666666667
4254683,5,B00439GWRE,"It took a while for me to get my copy of  ""Some Voices"" due to it coming twice with only half the film on the DVD. But Amazon took care of it and it was well worth the wait.
This is a wonderful character study of Ray a man who is struggling with his mental health and the beginnings of a new relationship with his brother (post mental institution release) and a new romance.
  The versatile Daniel Craig turns in another stunning performance as Ray and lights up the screen in true movie star style. But there is more to his performance than that. It is textured and deep as he goes from trying to adjust to life out of the mad house to the touching d&eacute;nouement.
  The fine talents of David Morrissy and Kelly MacDonald support Daniel Craig and it is well worth viewing for these performances as well. The direction by Simon Cellan-Jones is seamless and brilliant.
  This is Mr. Craig at his best pre-Bond and illustrates his growing power as perhaps the best actor of his generation.",1316044800,4,990,4.466666666666667
4254684,5,B00439GWRE,"Brilliant performance from Daniel Craig as Ray, who leaves a mental hospital to move in with his brother, played by David Morrissey. Ray is funny and charismatic, and his new relationship with Kelly MacDonald is delightful... till he goes off his meds, in an upsetting, heartbreaking and ultimately edge-of-the-seat horrifying way.

Cracking performances from everyone and more tension towards the end than most thrillers.  The best film I`ve seen in a long time, too.

As an aside, I noticed no problem with the picture quality on my newish widescreen TV.",1306195200,11,556,5.155555555555556
4254685,4,B00439GWRE,"I didn't have huge expectations for this movie, so I gave it 4 stars because it succeeded on its modest ambitions and expectations. I'll go so far as to say I was pleasantly  surprised. While it follows the low budget ""crazy"" lovers structure seen in other largely unwatched movies like ""Mad Love"" and ""Angel Baby"" this movie is better than those, I feel.

It's part comedy, part drama, part portrait of people who struggle with a terrible mental illness as well as the people whose lives they affect. In some parts the editing has that flashy, self-consciously postmodern feel that was popular in the U.K. (among other places) at the turn of the century, but it's for the most part well-utilized and not intrusive. There's laughs, touching moments, a setting rich with atmosphere, and a pretty neat soundtrack.

The story revolves around Ray, a guy released from a mental hospital who goes to work in his brother Pete's restaurant. Pete is watchful, protective, concerned, and worried about his brother, but this is born out of a genuine desire to see him succeed but at the same time worry over a relapse. Ray meets Laura, a mentally ill young woman, and the two fall in love very quickly. Things start going so well for Ray he feels his medication is unnecessary and discontinues it. Then things start to go bad.

While it sounds easy to predict what will happen from there, I should say there's a little more than you'd think, and it's carried over with a great deal of sympathy, tension, and believability. Not much is clich or trite and the movie is a well-executed work.

The acting also excels. Daniel Craig as Ray (unrelated note: I still find Craig as an implausible choice for James Bond - we'll soon find out) adds just the right dimension to this role to generate interest and keep it realistic, with a nice division between feeling sympathy for him but also worried about his situation and prospects. Kelly Macdonald also excels here, which is no surprise, she is always a very enjoyable actor to watch, and is fantastic playing the warm, down-on-their-luck women roles; she's in her element here. David Morrissey is fine as the protective older brother but I wasn't left with a strong impression on the performance. Julie Graham is a good Scottish character actor who does a fine turn in her role as the waitress Mandy.

To conclude, this is a surprisingly fine movie, but by no means a great or excellent one. It succeeds in its objectives, entertains well through a mixture of drama and comedy, boasts strong characterization, plotting, setting, bolstered by a good script and fine acting. If you've found your way to this remote review, it's probably because you have some interest in an aspect of the movie, and anyone with an interest I'd recommend watching this movie, I don't think it's apt to disappoint.",1153699200,19,2827,4.770961145194274
8414453,5,B00439GWRE,"Lovely movie. So glad I found it. Young Daniel Craig, David Morrissey great acting even then. Must look for more like this. Mental illness depicted how it must be within the mind. Sad",1528934400,,183,4.575757575757576
8414454,5,B00439GWRE,Not mainstream at all...one of Daniel's best performances.,1528329600,,58,6.375
8414455,4,B00439GWRE,"Good indie movie - I'm a big fan of both Daniel Craig & Kelly MacDonald, and they're both terrific in this.",1519257600,,107,4.142857142857143
8414456,5,B00439GWRE,"Bright and creative Ray ( Daniel Craig), his schizophrenia managed by meds, is leaving the psych hospital, proclaiming that he's no longer crazy enough to stay.  This is his journey, full of familial, romantic, and sexual love, bouts of extreme frustration, insightful talk, giddy lovely playfulness, and an impassioned desire to pitch the meds. To say more would spoil.  Daniel Craig is stupendous in this role. 2 other extraordinary performances are delivered by Kelly Macdonald and David Morrissey. All filmmaking disciplines are in sync and beautifully executed. Highly recommend.",1493596800,3,584,5.550561797752809
8414457,5,B00439GWRE,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Quirky yet very real and moving.,1491868800,,73,3.933333333333333
8414458,3,B00439GWRE,"Enjoyable -- the actress is cute, very good in the role, and there is good writing and flow. The lack of a backstory (what Daniel Craig's character's past is all about is never revealed) was a problem for me, made it a bit incomplete. His performance seemed a bit forced, but had enough true notes that I got past it. I like movies that are slices of life, that's what this is, so if the beginning is sudden and the end not more than an ending that leaves you with the feeling of how things will be vs. what happened next? It still works for me. 4 stars if it was more complete. 5 if a huge tragedy occurs and you feel it. Those lacking, it's a solid 3+.",1481846400,,654,4.077519379844961
8414459,2,B00439GWRE,Was a really wierd movie about a mental case that goes out of control. A young Daniel Craig in an english movie. Definatly not one of his better movies.,1481328000,,152,4.275862068965517
