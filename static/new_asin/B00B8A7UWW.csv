Also getting very tired of, and bored by environmentalist propaganda.",1389052800,3,141,6.1
5563042,2,B00B8A7UWW,I should have paid closer attention. I thought Ocean Giants were Whales. The largest sea creature in this movie was a 6 foot long shark. Very disappointed.,1388188800,3,155,4.777777777777778

8564077,2,B00B8A7UWW,"I expected more Giants as the title suggests; I already had fish on the reef.
I was dissappointed to find most to the documentary a repeat of what I already had.",1415577600,,161,4.225806451612903

8564082,1,B00B8A7UWW,"For whatever reason, this won't play. I attempted to view it after the allowed return date so I cannot return it. Every other video in my extensive collection works fine. As soon as I put it in and it tries reading it, it will eject it back out. Blu-ray says region free. Bizarre. Be careful when purchasing this.",1405382400,,313,4.413793103448276
8564083,3,B00B8A7UWW,Not what I expected but was still informative.,1404691200,,46,4.875
8564084,2,B00B8A7UWW,"Where are the giants? Bought this for my 7-year-old granddaughter, who's a fan of sharks, whales, and 3D. After seeing an interminable amount of shots of tiny reef fish and none of the ""giants"" in the title, she turned to me and said, ""Granddad, this is boring."" I couldn't have agreed more. We shut it down, and I gave the disc to my neighbor to look at on his own new 3D TV. This isn't the first 3D nature film to disappoint. (Gave those to my neighbor as well.) Lesson learned: stick to IMAX.",1396656000,,495,4.276595744680851
