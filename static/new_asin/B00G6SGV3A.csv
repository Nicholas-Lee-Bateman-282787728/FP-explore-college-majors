6061739,3,B00G6SGV3A,"Just watched this one hour program as recorded on my tv from a few nights ago & was shocked to see that in this new CBS investigation, while there was a good review of the theory that one of the shots came from the School Book Depository Bldg., the head shot was not even mentioned as a part of this investigation!!! How could that have been omitted? Then I saw at the end of the program the offer of this video for 3 1/2 hrs on Amazon! Looks like a LOT was left out! Did I miss any info about this program being incomplete? Of course, this is also quite a tease...Looking forward to a lot more info (3 stars since so much was left out of the tv version).",1384819200,,655,4.046153846153846
6061740,5,B00G6SGV3A,"Although I work at CBS I must admit that I found this DVD riveting. I was a teen when JFK was murdered and my family and I (like most Americans) were glued to CBS for the superb CBS coverage of Walter Cronkite, Eric Severaid, Dan Rather, etc. There work is no less impactful now ...and the fact that there is no narration over the three and a half hours of material from those horrible four days is perfectly suited to telling the story ""as it happened"". Compared to any other coverage this is the definitive version...but again I am biased, but still proud of Cronkite and his CBS News colleagues.

6061741,3,B00G6SGV3A,Interestinghistorical timeline for part 1  The Warren Report (part 2) well worth the viewing.,1407456000,,93,5.642857142857143
6061742,5,B00G6SGV3A,what a weekend that was....great job here,1406246400,,41,5.0
6061743,1,B00G6SGV3A,Because the content of the CD met my expectations. Thus it exhibited the assassination in the perspective of CBS news.,1391644800,,118,4.95
6061744,4,B00G6SGV3A,"It is hard for me to say I LOVE a DVD...  This was very interesting and informative, so I purchased it for my brother, who is a history buff.",1388793600,,141,3.8620689655172415
6061745,5,B00G6SGV3A,Purchased as a Christmas gift for a loved one who LOVED it! A much appreciated addition to their collection. Thank you.,1388707200,,119,4.714285714285714
6061746,3,B00G6SGV3A,Good for a one time view.  There is nothing on the DVD that you can't find by searching the internet.,1388188800,,101,4.05
6061747,5,B00G6SGV3A,"I have already watched this documentary several times
and I like it more each time.  Walter Chronkite was the best!",1387670400,,115,4.75
6061748,3,B00G6SGV3A,"This was an okay documentary. It did show a lot of the live events as described. The quality of the film was not as good as some of the specials on television with the same pictures.  I thought the Warren Commission report with Walter Cronkite was an added bonus that was NOT necessary. I would  have liked more live coverage instead. There is also no brochure at all in the DVD box.  Unfortunately, this is probably the best DVD for the live coverage that is available.",1387584000,,470,4.441860465116279
6061749,5,B00G6SGV3A,Good job by Bob Schieffer.  Explains those painful days.  Bought it for my Grandchildren so they would know the events of that horrible day.  Will never forget JFK.,1387497600,,164,4.785714285714286
6061750,5,B00G6SGV3A,"THIS PURCHASE WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED, AND IT ARRIVED QUICKLY.VERY PLEASED THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE, WE EJOYED THE VIDEO VERY MUCH  THANKS",1387497600,,138,4.75
6061751,2,B00G6SGV3A,"Perhaps it was wishful thinking, but I was hoping for a little narrative or explanation to fill in what happened on 11/22/63 and during the days that followed.  This DVD contains some iconic scenes, but is missing some others.  You can certainly see how technology has improved the quality of images, but you'll also see a few examples of the same sort of early, inaccurate reporting that occurs when an unexpected event is unfolding.  I would not buy this DVD again.",1387497600,,467,4.7407407407407405
6061752,1,B00G6SGV3A,"I expected the ""48 hours"" show that I saw on TV.  It was a one hour show which should run 45 minutes without commercials which would be perfect to show in my U.S. History classes.  Instead I got 3 1/2 hours of news coverage and barely was able to get to the shooting of Oswald in that same 45 min. period.  I would still be interested to know where I can get the TV show that I saw.",1387411200,2,382,3.871794871794872
6061753,4,B00G6SGV3A,"If you were alive on that fateful Friday, many images on this video are already burnt into your memory cells.
Others that are too young to remember, should find this an interesting, and a bit odd look at the News reporting process of 1963,
 and how it has advanced in 50 years.
These men reporting were REAL journalists.
Not the opinion spewing hacks of today's cable ""news"" outlets that pollute the airwaves.",1387411200,,409,4.680555555555555
6061754,5,B00G6SGV3A,"Short and sweet - if you are looking for the best ""as it happened"" network coverage, this is it.
I was ten years old on that awful day, and remember my dad saying that we were going to watch CBS and Cronkite, period. And we did. The television stayed on from that Friday November 22 until after the funeral on Monday the 25th.
Since that day I have watched several networks offerings and in my opinion, nothing still beats Cronkite,
This is the best. If you remember that terrible day or are looking for the best network coverage, you will experience not only the assassination of a beloved President, nor television news coverage in its infancy  but true news journalism, a lost art in today's digital news idiocy.",1387065600,,715,4.5859375
6061755,2,B00G6SGV3A,"I would have done away with the Warren Commission program and focused entirely on the network coverage of the assassination itself. What was included was simply very choppy and it seemed to jump from one event to another and left so much valuable material out. Disappointing, but better than nothing.",1386720000,2,300,5.02
6061756,4,B00G6SGV3A,"While the 1988 Four Days in November special was much better, it is disappointing that it is not available commercially on dvd  ....it has a much better chronology of the CBS news coverage as it happened. I am fortunate to have a videotape of that 1988 special and preserved digitally...but this current CBS release does have a lot of extra footage that was not shown in the 1988 special so I was very glad to have purchased this and have some original CBS coverage on a commercially released dvd.. I would much rather have had extra 1963 news coverage instead of the boring 1964 Warran Report special but all in all, this 2013 Scheiffer-hosted As It Happened is a good addition to the footage I already have from the Rather-hosted 1988 Four Days in November....I recommend this dvd because CBS is unlikely to ever release another special of its JFK assassination anytime soon, at least in my lifetime.",1386374400,,902,4.708860759493671
6061757,3,B00G6SGV3A,"This DVD was advertised at the end of the November 2013 CBS TV broadcast of a program with the same name, which would indicate it is a copy of the program just viewed, if not an expanded version of it. It's not.

It does have a longer running time than the TV show did, but it's a modern editor's condensed version of what he or she felt was important. There is 1963 CBS TV footage here that I've not seen elsewhere which I found interesting, but it seems like the progression of events is choppy here with some well-known events and footage missing.  The bonus program of the 1964 CBS TV Warren Commission results is of little interest.

This DVD has an unbelievable current price of 35.99 but was discounted to 19.98 here on amazon when I bought it, which is still way too much for the content provided.  Pick up another DVD such as the remastered/restored version of ""Years Of Lightning, Day of Drums"", ""JFK 3 Shots That Changed America"", or find the documentary ""Four Days In November"" on Youtube (or hopefully as a future DVD release), rather than this DVD.",1385510400,3,1062,4.515625
6061758,1,B00G6SGV3A,"This was not what I was lead to believe. The 31/2 hrs on one disk is not all 'as it happens'. Only 90 minutes, and a BONUS 2 hr Cronkite oldie. If the jacket had been worded differently, it would have been all right. I still would have bought it at 90 minutes. I'm tired of getting BONUS Baloney, when what I need is an accurate description of the product. An that's a wrap.

The T.V. Presentation seemed to be better with more commentary about some significant observations, the one being Bobby Kennedy blowing past LBJ onto AF 1 when it landed at Andrews. I did not even see that in this DVD version.

Hugely disappointed

Disappointed Amazon Customer",1385251200,6,653,4.470588235294118
6061759,4,B00G6SGV3A,"I saw this special on TV and found it very good so I ordered the DVD.
The DVD itself is excellent, but the main menu page of the DVD has a
glaring error: The title, instead of reading ""As it happened: JFK
Assassination, reads ""As it happened: JKF Assassination""...in HUGE
letters. I find it nearly unbelievable that the producers of this DVD
allowed this very obvious error to go through. Other than this, the
program is excellent. I give the product a 4 of 5 due to this error.
The DVD, is said to be a ""made to order"" product. I posted a photo on
Amazon of the printing error. Does anyone have a suggestion on who else
I could notify of this? It's a huge error and does bother me when I see it.
They should fix it and send customers a corrected copy.",1385251200,2,752,4.1931034482758625
6061760,2,B00G6SGV3A,"I was disappointed with this DVD and it really missed its mark.  It jumped around through the four days and left our parts of the coverage.  To be quite honest, the CBS program many years ago called ""Four Days in November"" was much better.  As I recall about an hour and one half of this DVD actually covers assassination to funeral and then you see interviews with people that takes up the other half as well as Walter Cronkite's commentary about the Warren Commission.  I really wish that CBS had put more of the assassination to funeral coverage.  I really wish that CBS would put out the entire four days as it was.  I am certain that it would be expensive but I would certainly purchase it because this is a very unique time in American history.",1385078400,16,750,4.437956204379562
