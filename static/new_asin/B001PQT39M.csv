8334323,3,B001PQT39M,"PBS does a very good job of showing and describing fractals, yet nowhere in the video did I hear the explanation of what the Mandelbrot Set _is_.  How annoying:  I wanted my girlfriend to hear it from someone besides me, instead she got the run-around; this DVD is all about the 3rd dimension and what self-similarity looks like.

Fractals are the graphed-solution to the equation (-1)^1/2  (square root of -1).  There is no ""correct"" 3rd-dimensional answer to this question; there is no square root of any negative number.  The Mandelbrot Set is the graphed set of potential solutions (black=nearness to 0, color=nearness to 1 or -1).

That fractals have any correlation to reality at all is PROOF of a 4th (or higher) dimension.  D'uh.  PBS just wasn't brave enough to show it or say it.

Otherwise, neat to see, but I wouldn't call what they do ""hunting for""; it is more like ""hinting at"".

<<caveat - I haven't discussed fractals in 20 years, so might be better to do your own research>>",1402876800,,991,4.703488372093023
8334324,5,B001PQT39M,I love science and fractals are fascinating to me. This video does a great job of explaining what fractals are and how they show up in so many areas of the universe.,1394668800,,165,4.1875
8334325,5,B001PQT39M,"I remember seeing this on PBS and I knew I had to have it on blueray. I was a mathematics major in college and this has twisted my mind (more than this awesome TA I had for a calc class). I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around the concept, but most important is the really cool patterns! Just enjoy or use this as a jumping off point for further investigating and understanding!",1386720000,,389,4.2
8334326,3,B001PQT39M,This is a good introduction to the topic.  It's basically a survey and exposition on the early entry of fractal concepts into the realm of more mainline mathematics/physics.,1361491200,,173,5.178571428571429
8334327,5,B001PQT39M,"This is an excellent hour documentary that NOVA is known for. Everything is simply described. First you'll find out what the heck a fractal is. Then you learn its applications; from finding tumors; mapping the oxygen flow of a rainforest; weaving designs on shirts; and computer graphics. The computer graphics show how lava was simulated by fractal. That example is my favorite part of the entire video. The Blu-ray is a little pricey, but worth every cent. Besides you will be opened to another subject of mathematics much like when you first learn algebra, trigonometry, or calculus. Fractals are a subject of their own. Prepare for a ""mind expanding"" video. And at the same time help support PBS

8334328,5,B001PQT39M,"I was aware of Fractals in general as we all are. However this presentation takes it to new heights. We learn that it is more about math. We get to see how fractals are not only a part of nature but fractals actually have practical applications and potentials for future disciplines.

If you do not personally apply the information at least you will be fractal literate. Me, I am going to buy some of Benoit Mandelbrot's books. The first one mentioned in the DVD is out of print (rare). Then I was surprised to see that fractals were applied to woven fabrics. I wonder if there is a pattern book or if I will have to make my own drafts?

I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. The pictures are crisp but not over enhanced.  The rare, very few to nil, extras on the DVD as it is a direct copied of the NOVA program, including the sponsors.
