3523887,2,B001D2WUB6,"This series is very predictable, the characters are uninteresting and the dialog is more crude than funny.  Tracey used to be fresh, fun and above all funny.  This series just seems to repeat the same scenarios in each episode with F and S bomb explatives thrown in.  Very sad for someone so talented to have to stoop so low.",1238630400,3,325,4.47457627118644
3523888,5,B001D2WUB6,"Tracey Ullman can impersonate just about anyone. ""State of the Union"" is so entertaining.  It can be watched over and over.",1236384000,,123,4.857142857142857
3523889,5,B001D2WUB6,"I saw this series on Showtime and loved it...bought it for a friend for Christmas, and when we tried to play it Christmas day after 2 episodes the DVD just wouldn't play.  We tried on a number of different players, just no good.  Too bad, I loved this show....",1232323200,,260,4.285714285714286
3523890,5,B001D2WUB6,It is about time that Tracey fans were rewarded with new material. It will not disappoint those who have eagerly awaited her very on-target humor.,1229212800,5,146,4.88

8291469,5,B001D2WUB6,"Tracey Ullman is a one of a kind comedian with many faces, a clever, quick witted mind, and a great sense of humor who unleashed her critical view of typical Americans, whether they are rich or poor, she doesn't hold back!  I found many of her skits hilarious!",1423440000,,260,4.416666666666667
8291470,4,B001D2WUB6,"Tracey Ullman is pretty funny, when she mimicked some known celebrities. Her combination of dressing up and acting like those persons is very good and entertaining. She has the right mix of acting well and selecting certain news events that were important in the history of our nation. I enjoyed watching her quite a bit......",1374364800,,326,4.945454545454545
8291471,5,B001D2WUB6,"Tracey Ullman is, pure and simple, a genius! I have to rate her impersonations up there with the likes of Carol Burnett and Lily Tomlin.  Not only are her performances in which she plays both women and men impeccably portrayed, but the accents she creates are superb. The material is hip and the commentaries on these modern times totally hit the mark. In other words, you'll laugh your ass off! Buy it! It's a deal at these reasonable prices. One for the collection. A keeper!!!",1328745600,,479,4.635294117647059
8291472,5,B001D2WUB6,"This show is freaking amazing I'm a late fan to tracy i only knew of her because the simpsons came from her show on FOX. I Then fell in love with Tracy Takes On. Then I saw this show in target when i was buying Takes On Seasons 3 & 4. This show is great the DVD's Are fine I have seasons 1 & 2 BUT I wish they would release SEASON 3  I found this show when it was in it's 2nd season so I figured I would catch up when season 3 came out on dvd and then i would watch season 4 but there was no season 4 and now there is no season 3 dvd which sucks because I love this show and now i can't see how it ended

PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3",1306713600,,628,3.5434782608695654
8291473,5,B001D2WUB6,"""Tracey Ullman's State of the Union"" provides a fresh and unique critique of the state of American politics, celebrity, and social justice.  There's not one issue not covered in the first season of this series.

Tracey Ullman has had her finger on the pulse of America for decades now.  It's wonderful to have her back in a weekly show!

""State""'s celebrity impersonations are incredible!  Tracey Ullman's Andy Rooney impersonation, as well as Renee Zellweger, have now become iconic.  The Renee sketch is one that you never want to end!

""State of the Union"" is not a remake, or a continuation of ""Tracey Takes On"", or ""The Tracey Ullman Show"".  It's a fresh format, still allowing Ullman to show off all of her many talents.

""State of the Union"" wins where ""Little Britain: USA"" massively failed.  Tracey understands America.  She's lived here for over 20 years.  She knows its people inside and out.

The look of the series and the theme music is enchanting.  Troy Miller does a great job as director.  Troy Miller, is producer of, ""Flight of the Concords"".

I have to disagree with the comment about the quality of the DVD.  I had no problems playing it, and it's features are good.  The bloopers are funny, the deleted bits are enjoyable.

Can't wait for more!  ***** Stars!",1241049600,10,1280,4.757990867579909
8291474,5,B001D2WUB6,So funny...nobody does it better.  The Andy Rooney take off was hilarious.  The only weak character for me is Padma Perkesh.  I just wonder if the 'Little Britain' guys will be angry or flattered because of the blatantly similiar format?,1240704000,,237,4.875
8291475,1,B001D2WUB6,Umm...yeah...not what I was expecting.  I usually hit pause when I go to the restroom...not this time!  Just let it play!  Wasn't much to miss.  I've seen her do so much better.  Sorry Tracey.,1240185600,2,192,4.529411764705882
8291476,5,B001D2WUB6,"Tracey is absolutely brilliant as this cast of characters.  My husband and I laughed until we cried. She is spot on, impersonating regular folk as well as celebrities, and it's all in good fun. I will watch it over and over again and can't wait to buy the next series.",1239753600,7,268,4.36
