8537322,5,B00979KDPC,"I've practiced martial arts since my teens. Besides one of my favorite actors leading (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and David Mamet's excellent writing and direction, the message is clear: honor is everything in martial arts. With several good fight scenes and a surprising twist, this should wow the MMA and ""fight"" crowd that expect action, and teach them a lesson in martial arts etiquette. The ending is terrific.",1474243200,,406,5.166666666666667

8537324,5,B00979KDPC,"Don't know why Amazon lists this as from 2002, but it's from 2008. This is the rental version of the DVD, identical to the regular retail version except for the bar code as far as I can tell.

This is a David Mamet film about a jiu-jitsu master who finds his principles tested by extreme circumstance. The title refers to the honorary red belt belonging to his mentor. A few tips for enjoying this:

1. It's not really a martial-arts or action movie. Mamet says, ""It's a story of the journey of a man who wants to be pure and gets tempted."" Though limited, what fighting is in it is well done.

Mamet is a student of jiu-jitsu himself and calls this ""my love letter to the world and philosophy of jiu-jitsu."" He had the help of numerous world-class fighters, including five-time UFC champion Randy Couture, who has a role on screen (and accompanies Mamet on the DVD commentary track), world jiu-jitsu champion John Machado, who is the opponent in the climactic fight, and renowned jiu-jitsu teacher Renato Magno, who choreographed most of the fights. (It's fiction--depictions of shady activities aren't an attack on real MMA fighting, they're obstacles on the journey of the hero.)

Mamet also sees this as a film noir, and there are elements of that to appreciate about it.

2. Sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence. That it's Mamet makes us look for a grand conspiracy at work from the start. Don't try to make the conspiracy bigger, earlier or more planned out than it needs to be. The grander you make it, the less plausible it is. Properly trimmed, it's plausible enough.

3. Even if you have trouble following all the plot details--typically a risk with Mamet, though not unduly so here--the main character, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is worth knowing. In this role he reminds me of Laurence Fishburne in The Matrix, but not as ponderous. (There is a little philosophy in this movie, but the principles, like the hero, are simple and down to earth.)

4. Mamet sees the main character as being tested and, at a crucial point, giving up. One might easily see his action as just sticking to his principles, but if you understand it as giving up, the film makes more sense, including the slap (you'll see).

Also keep in mind the principle of not being distracted. The main character meets with some powerful potential distractions near the end.

5. The ending is a bit incredible in a couple ways, but if you keep in mind that Samurai films are among the models Mamet's working with, it fits the genre.",1423526400,,2515,4.671945701357466
8537325,5,B00979KDPC,"Not your average punch up martial art movie, more the considered, thoughtful type.  Don't be miss led though the action scenes are still strong.  Illustrated core philosophies that make the martial arts such a worthwhile practice.  Overall great viewing.",1410393600,,254,5.461538461538462
