8401288,5,B003NOHL3O,"Hello and this is actually my first review of an item on here. Why i chose to do this product is becuase i love digimon!!!! When it was on t.v., i was 10 then and now 20, i thought it was the most awesome show, better than pokemon. After school we'd rush upstairs and turn on the tv for the afternoon showing of it and wait till it was done but get in trouble with out mom becuase she didn't want us to watch it before homework, but we still did it, especially i to the point of crying, because i was an avid fan to the serie. If only digimon were still around as toys, books, cards and more shows becuase pokemon is just so over rated and digimon wasn't around long enough to even be givin a chance by the younger generations. I don't own this item but i will purchase it in the near future becuase i have digimon on the mind all the time and want to have the t.v. show for myself, so please bring digimon back soon.",1284422400,3,917,4.016393442622951
