8183424,5,B000O77LXI,Of course I loved it.  I ordered it.  They came quickly and both DVDs operated properly.  Its a very strange combo but both movies are classics on their own.,1388275200,,157,4.344827586206897
8183425,5,B000O77LXI,"Both films are awesome!
""Fargo"" is one of the most interesting films of the past thirty years A film that made the Coen brothers. Interesting not only as a film but the fact that it's based on a real event makes it that much more interesting...and strange. It's true...truth is definitely stranger than fiction.
But fiction has it's moments and ""Rain Man"" is one of the best examples of that thought. Hoffman is incredible in this film! An Oscar winner and deservedly so! Should also be on the AFI's Top 100 list!",1378944000,,513,4.586956521739131
8183426,5,B000O77LXI,"Good deal. Fun for the whole village. The DVD was round and shiny. With a hole in the middle and played the movie that was on the label when put in a machine called a DVD player. DVD player MUST be correctly attached to a device called a TV or ""Television""  Interesting movies too.",1372896000,,281,4.203703703703703
8183427,5,B000O77LXI,"I enjoyed them both I have seen rain man many times, but Fargo was a first.  I loved it and so did my husband!",1357516800,,110,3.5833333333333335
8183428,1,B000O77LXI,"ok... so take two great films and put them on one dvd for a low price!  BRILLIANT!  except for one thing: THE BIGGEST MISMATCH OF ALL TIME.  /le sigh... seriously, what were they thinking?!  ""hey!  i know what will go GREAT paired with Rain Man: FARGO!  after seeing Peter Stormare shove the various parts of Steve Buschemi afterward being shot down by Frances Macdormond on a frozen pond, people will LOVE to see the most genuinely heart-warming performance by either Dustin Hoffman or Tom Cruise!""  see what i'm saying?  i love both of these films, personally, but this ""convenient"" pack is about as convenient as packing uh... bricks and peaches together?  geniuses on the corporate end on this one.",1252972800,5,702,4.831932773109243
