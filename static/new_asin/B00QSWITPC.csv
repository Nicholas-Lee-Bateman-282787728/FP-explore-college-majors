8692758,1,B00QSWITPC,"This version combines the past, present, and zombie looking creature into a blended tale that makes no sense. Red (Iren Levy) on her way to give medicine to grandma finds herself trapped in the castle of an old evil ""thing"" with powers and minions that he uses from time to time, something that didn't die during the flood that took Atlantis. Oh yeah, he feeds off of fear. Meanwhile there is another Red in the present age taking nature photos held up in a house apparently that was on the same spot as the castle. Exactly what that was about, I don't know.
Badly written script. Low budget special effects, although the rubber masks were nice, if only they could move, deplorable acting.
  This film sucked.

Guide: No F-bombs or sex. Nudity ( Iren Levy,  Alanna Forte- seriously nice)",1428019200,,787,4.640287769784172
