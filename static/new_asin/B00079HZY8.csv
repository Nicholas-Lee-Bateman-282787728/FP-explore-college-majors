2206331,5,B00079HZY8,"thats my opinion of Tobe Hooper's new (& soon to be classic)horror movie ""Toolbox Murders"". i have been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd for the past year1/2 ever since i read a little article about it in FANGORIA. WELL i just got done watching it & i have to say it was well worth the wait! Tobe Hooper is my personal favorite american horror director. i love most all of his efforts especially the less sucsessful & more critisized ones like ""Eaten Alive"" & ""Lifeforce"" i believe that so much of his work is overlooked & underrated simpley because of the massive sucsess of his debut film ""T.C.M."" he kinda set the bar to high even for himself by pretty much inventing a genre/style of horror film makeing on his very first try. anyway i know he's great & i also know that i got to have some giant golfballz to be claiming that this is his best since ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" but im not jokeing! in my opinion i truley think it is, its got so many classic old-school tricks & treats that tobe is best at displaying(because he invented them) this movie is a strait to the grit classic 70's/80's slasher flick & i absolutley love it! this is the film that eveybody has been waiting for Tobe Hooper to make! ITS A MASTERPIECE! if this is a sign of whats to come from this veteran master of horror then as a huge fan im wide-eyed & drueling! ENJOY",1110931200,,1355,4.317647058823529
2206332,5,B00079HZY8,"Beware of renting in an old building that's being renovated - you never know what all that dust and noise might ""wake up"".  Tobe Hooper is BAAAACK and he is NOT messing around in this scary, gory movie.  Set in the Lusman Arms (but filmed at the creepy old Ambassador Hotel - site of many tragedies of its own), a young couple, Nell and Steven (the great Angela Bettis of ""May"" fame and Brent Roam), move in on the typical ""dark and stormy night"", unaware that a murder has already occurred in the building.  As Steven is a med school intern, he is away a lot, leaving Nell to her own devices in this creepy building with it's MORE than fair share of strange tenants.  She hears things, calls the police (who, of course, don't find anything) who think she is crazy, a friend down the hall disappears, she starts doing a little investigating into the Lusman's past and that's where the REAL fun starts.  There are several power tool-related murders but Hooper has them lit in such a way that you can't quite make out what exactly is being done but the outcome is obvious (and quite grisly in a few cases).  The building itself is a principal character and a very scary one at that - with all the dark hallways, boarded-up areas, the eerie back stairways, plastic sheeted areas for the renovation - LOTS of shadows and plays of light to startle and mislead.  The supporting cast is quite good: Rance Howard (father of Ron and Clint) as a long-time denizen of the Lusman, Juliet Landau as Nell's friend, Julia, co-writer Adam Gierasch as Ned the creepy handyman, Sheri Moon (""House of 1000 Corpses"") as Daisy, Adam Weisman as the voyeuristic young neighbor Austin who finally believes Nell.  Very suspenseful movie with a great ""chase"" sequence through the uninhabited parts of the building - Tobe DOES love to have his female leads chased by psychos - with some horrifying discoveries along the way all make for a really fun, frightening horror film.  Welcome back, Tobe!!!!  We missed the hard core fellow from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".",1110931200,4,2036,4.662011173184357
2206333,5,B00079HZY8,"As the title states, the first killing looks very amateurish, but once past that one, you'll see some very disturbing kills that will make you not regret returing this to your local video store.

Tobe Hooper does it again with this movie. Too bad it's straight-to-video.

Enjoy!!!",1110585600,,280,4.9361702127659575
2206334,3,B00079HZY8,"Toolbox Murders starts out as a simple slasher flick, then takes a sharp right turn into semi-Masonic horror. But the slasher element never gets too far away. Basic plot: nice young couple moves into creepy apartment building with alchemical symbols on the floor. People die. Wife discovers something she will regret discovering, and explores it. That last bit is the sharp right turn, and if you're the kind of person who really liked the house in The Blair Witch Project and that cave in Jeepers Creepers, you'd really like the places this movie goes.

Despite Tobe Hooper's fairly good track record, I believe Toolbox Murders went more or less straight to video. Kind of a pity; it's better than most slasher flicks that hit the theaters. Also, it's got Juliet Landau (who you may recognize as Drusilla) in it. Most of all, it's got a tenuous grounding in Jack Parson's Babalon Working.

Seriously! It's pretty tenuous, though. Really just a one-line tossaway: ""They worshipped a god, a man who mixed magic and rocket science."" Since the movie takes place in Hollywood, and since the antecedent to ""they"" is Hollywood stars, the reference is fairly obvious. Well, if you're a Jack Parsons fan. The timeline works out, too, if I'm not mistaken.

Anyhow. I'm not going to say it's a great work of art, but I will say that Tobe Hooper has a very good sense of how to make a simple movie scary. His use of setting is superb; in order for this movie to work, the apartment building has to be creepy but conceivably a place where people would live, and he pulls that off with flair. I'd definitely recommend looking Toolbox Murders up if you like horror.",1110153600,2,1651,4.705882352941177
2206335,4,B00079HZY8,"horror director Tobe Hooper (poltergeist, the texas chainsaw massacre)returns with the terrifying tale of a Hollywood apartment building and the murderous evil that lives within.

2206336,4,B00079HZY8,"The Ambassador Hotel an L.A. landmark takes center stage in Tobe Hooper's re-envisioning of the THE TOOLBOX MURDERS.  Sharing the leading role with the Hotel is scream queen in the making Angela Bettis. Here she is cast as a more down to earth character than her two star making roles in CARRIE, and MAY and it is nice to see she is capable of great range.  The rest of the ensemble cast fares well also, most notably Rance Howard (Ron and Clint's father). The first half of the film is mostly buildup with a couple of effective jolt type scares, while the later half lets the blood spill and harkens back to directors more classic work in being just genuinely frightening.  Some great ideas are evident in the writing and while the finale could be a bit more ""fleshed out"" the pieces are there for you to put together  (unlike the hit you over the head forced twist ending of say SAW). I was quite pleased as the credits rolled on this stripped down piece of throwback horror, something that can't be said of most of the recent genre attempts (excluding SHAUN OF THE DEAD and Bubba Ho Tep) No its no TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, but what is?

2206364,5,B00079HZY8,"To me this remake of the original classic is actually better than the original,Tobe Hooper does the directing and producing of this gory slice of horror. Set in Hollywood this movie is about a hotel that was built over 80 years prior to the time frame of where the film is set. Starts out with Sheri Moon buying a paper and going to her hotel room and gets murdered almost instantly. Fast forward a bit and we meet a couple who are moving into the hotel for their time in town because her boyfriend is a practicing Dr. Who has been relocated and is always working,his girlfriend Nell starts hearing strange sounds and seeing strange markings etched into the wall. She sees that the landlord or building super is weird and so is his assistant who does the repairs is also a bit off. She gets creeped out but meets a friend who is always running and she does it everyday like clockwork,she does an online chat thing and the kid across  the hall likes to watch her. The girl and Nell are supposed to go running but she disappears,without a trace. The super claims that the building is old and it is Hollywood,people come and go so it is nothing strange. Nell starts searching around and finds out that the bulding was made by a guy who practiced dark arts and black magic. The building was shut down because too many people started dying and it was closed,the girl searches some more and finds out that the guy who built it was never found. She meets a guy with town records and he shows her that their is a hidden room throughout the building,because every floor is missing 1 room that is walled off. She realizes that people keep disappearing and she calls the cops several times and they keep showing up to find nothing,yet the people keep disappearing and the blood is certianly flowing. The boyfriend of Nell is hardly ever in the movie until the end and when he is he keeps saying don't worry. She spots the neighbor kid spying on the girl with his laptop and camera,the markings on the walls are spells to keep him alive. The guy is almost 170 years old and he is into taking bodies from this hotel and killing them in the most violent of ways. Nailgunned to the ceiling,drill to the head,powdered lye on the face of the doorman. A pair of bolt cutters to the spine of the super,people getting sawed in half and dismembered. Trust me this movie is way more brutal,eerie and all around indane than the original version. The movie will not disappoint you,if you are a gorehound or a fan of Tobe Hooper's films or just like the original film you will enjoy this one. The film is amazing,so much vicious images and so many plot twists to keep you entertained and at the edge of your seat. Don't listen to the negative reviews just take the 88 minutes out and watch the film,it will not disappoint. It will keep you guessing until the end,and the ending is insane.",1427414400,3,2863,4.442965779467681
2206365,5,B00079HZY8,"Why do I love this movie? Shall I count the ways?

(yes)

1. Angela Bettis=Best. Scream. Queen. EVER! What is the magic in her that makes me vastly entertained by just watching her get stressed? And then she appears in this pair of spectacles that make her look like a bug...! You know what? I actually feel like she's my best friend.
2. Shades of Dante Tomaselli Everywhere! And this is not the only time. It's been happening a lot. Movies like Scar, Visible Scars, several others I can't quite recall, but all of them with at least the feel of being the work of young and brilliant talent--and they all have this rambling nature. No one can match the way that Tomaselli paints animated poems out of stale horror tropes that are all of a sudden alive again, alive and change, having undergone a sea change into something toxic and hideous. Now Tobe Hooper maybe don't need to learn from nobody, but maybe it's one master exploring the other's world, or maybe two geniuses arriving at the same place.
3. TIGHT! Not a frame wasted. Every scene has a plum surprise at its core. The sign of a good director is he's always thinking, agonizing over variations of,  ""Okay, we have the luggage coming out of the trunk. Do I show it being placed on the ground? And if so, why?"" Every second counts and Tobe Hooper never botches a one of them!
4. Best killer I've seen in a long time. Face it, even in good movies, sometimes what's behind the mask isn't worth the wait. But this time, hoo-boy!

What, is that not enough for you? WATCH THE FILM!!!!!!!",1408492800,3,1541,4.453900709219858

2206368,5,B00079HZY8,"I've said it before; I consider Angela Bettis to be one of the great under-rated actresses of our time. Her work always impresses me. Toolbox Murders is a typical ""Phantom Of The Opera"", style thriller. Not a great movie, but not a bad one either. A must buy for anyone who collects horror films. Incidentally, the movie was filmed in Los Angeles at the Ambassador Hotel at Wilshire Blvd. and Catalina St. It's now demolished and the site of the Ambassador Global School Of Education. Back in 1968, this was the hotel where Bobby Kennedy was shot and killed. A lot of history for me, I was 14 and watching the election coverage live, when it happened.

While searching IMDb, I found out that Angela Bettis' husband Kevin Ford, had made a documentary on the making of the movie.
It's called ""Toolbox Murders (As It Was)"". I found it, in it's entirety, at YouTube. Fun to see the behind the scenes stuff.

Like Hooper's infamous ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>"" (and to a lesser extent, the underappreciated but wholly worthwhile ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Funhouse/dp/B00023P4SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Funhouse</a>""), ""The Toolbox Murders"" is a slow and steady slasher that builds to its conclusion. Thanks to some slick directing and an effectively creepy setting, the film has a dirty and grimey atmosphere seen too little in more modern slashers. Also in the film's favor is the decade's unsung Scream-queen Angela Bettis, who keeps the film grounded and is likeable and credible enough that you want to follow her for an entire film. Of course, that's to say nothing of the often graphic and applause-worthy carnage  at hand. Those itching for some good late `70s/early `80s brutality will walk away feeling rather satisfied.

Unfortunately, the film is a bit by-the-numbers and suffers from its predictable nature. You may not see the film's twist coming right away, but you can be sure you'll figure who bites it and probably in what order. The film is filled to the brim with stock characters from the quirky neighbor to the creepy maintenance guy which tends to work against the solid performance by Bettis. Rarely does the film break away from convention, and although its throwback feel is refreshing, it gets a bit stale by the end and gives one the impression that Hooper directed the film in his sleep (and without the aid of Speilberg this time).

In short, ""The Toolbox Murders"" is an efficient slasher romp that offers little in the way of surprises. But as a character in the film would say, that's just part of the movie's charm. The film is very much in the spirit of Hooper's earlier work and fans of the bygone golden age of slashers will get the most mileage from it than anyone else. Just go into it with limited expectations and you'll find it to be a decent way to kill 90 minutes.",1306195200,,3053,6.126168224299065
2206376,4,B00079HZY8,"This coulda been one of the greats.

Director Tobe Hooper's Toolbox Murders had a top-notch brutal slasher in the making, possibly destined for the Horror Hall of Fame.  But, like a pick-axe getting buried deep in your kneecap, the out-of-control evil censorship wackos severely handicapped this gem for life.  Seriously, you don't have to be smarter than a fifth-grader to understand that censorship just doesn't belong in a horror flick.

Okay this may never have reached total elite slasher status, but the heinous cuts made to avoid the NC-17 rating are a little frustrating.  Luckily the extended brutality is still available for your sick viewing pleasure in the deleted scenes here.  Great gruesome fun.

The basic setup--we have a dilapidated old apartment complex, you know the kind that the landlord refers to as quirky and rich in history while the residents suffer through their lease period.  The beautiful Nell (Angela Bettis) moves in with her husband Steven and tries to adjust to the ramshackle lifestyle.

So cue the weird noises.  Clueless cops.  Missing neighbors.  We soon find out that there is something evil lurking within the walls.  The murders quickly commence, as somebody is using household tools as deadly weapons.

We've got the hammer, nail guns, circular saw....oh this movie has the greatest scalping scene EVER!  Totally gorerific!  It makes you forget about the illogical plot missteps and just enjoy the mayhem.

Plus of course we have Angella Bettis.  It's a safe bet that she's attracted her share of stalkers in real life.  Something about her, I'm not sure what but she's totally stalkable.

This movie starts a little slow and the story veers away from reality a bit.  Plus after so many dead bodies begin to pile up you'd think the stench would start to permeate the minds of the doubters?  Oh well.

I haven't seen the original, so I can't say how this remake compares, but on its own, this movie is a winner. A young couple moves into a rat trap old building in Hollywood. He's an intern and is gone most of the time leaving Nell Barrows with too much time on her hands. She finds out some strange things about the building's history and unbeknownst to all, somebody is murdering the tenants.

Right from the beginning when the camera is filming through a sheet of plastic in the rain, it manages to give off a downright unsettling atmosphere. A fantastic job was done lighting the creepy old building, making every shadow seem threatening. Everything feels old, grimy and unpleasant. The music is surprisingly good. There is the usual 'string swell' to make you jump, but otherwise it works well to ratchet up your nerves. The whole movie is an exercise in tension.

Really the only bad part about this movie is the whole 'toolbox murders' gimmick. The story really stands on its own and is good enough without the different tool for each murder shtick. If the killer just used a knife or something, that would have worked just as well. It felt like they needed to throw in the unusual murder weapons to keep the name.

Still, this was a pretty good movie. I'd recommend it to fans of old fashioned '70's and '80's horror movies. They don't make many like this any more.",1200960000,,2196,6.334448160535117
2206384,4,B00079HZY8,"Toolbox Murders (Tobe Hooper, 2004)

One of the recent rules of thumb I've been using to decide which movies I want to watch is that if it contains Angela Bettis, it can't be completely irredeemable. (We'll put aside the monstrosity that was Girl, Interrupted for the time being.) So when I saw Bettis' name attached to a Tobe Hooper joint, I figured it was worth a look. And while it wasn't as brilliant as I was hoping it would be, it was certainly a good deal of fun.

Bettis plays Nell Barrows. She, along with her husband Stephen (Brent Roam, perhaps best-known for now as a recurring character in the early days of The Shield), movie into an old building in Hollywood while Stephen does his medical residency in a nearby hospital. From the start, we know there's something weird about the building; in the opening scene, before we ever meet Stephen and Nell, one of the building's residents (Sheri Moon in one of her few non-Rob-Zombie-film appearances) is murdered by the building serial killer in an inventive, and rather grotesque, way. In addition, the building is undergoing extensive renovation, which leads to the set designers being able to play around with bare concrete, plastic, and the like. But I digress. Nell, currently unemployed, makes an attempt to meet some of her new neighbors, but oddly enough, they start disappearing pretty much as soon as she meets them. First next-door neighbor Saffron (Never Been Kissed's Sara Downing) disappears; her boyfriend Hans (Goldfinger guitarist Charlie Paulson) assumes she's taken off with another beau. Then Nell's new running partner Julia (Ed Wood's Juliet Landau) misses a running date. And Stephen is off at the hospital, so what's an overimaginative, unemployed young woman to do? Solve the mystery, of course, with the help of Chas (Georgia Rule's Rance Howard), who's lived in the building almost as long as it's existed.

Perhaps the most surprising thing about this movie was that it uses its low budget wisely, as so few horror films do these days. Hooper, who is of course best known for directing a low-budget horror picture (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), seems to have recaptured the spirit of low-budget filmmaking; savage, but very low-lit, special effects. I'm not sure why, but some of the death scenes on this movie were quite disturbing to me (in a ""my God, I can't believe he tried to get away with that in an R-rated movie!"" sense). For example, in the opening sequence, in which our damsel in distress is done in with a claw hammer, we get the usual cut-away shots you find in low-budget slasher films-- blood splashing onto the wall, the window, etc.-- but we also see the killer wielding the hammer, and there's a clump of skin/hair/etc. stuck in the claw. Which is logical, given the situation, but it's the kind of thing you rarely, if ever, see in this sort of scene. Not quite as surprising, but just as pleasant, is the caliber of the acting from the principals here. Yeah, there's overacting, as there's bound to be in any Tobe Hooper flick, but that just makes Bettis' rather quiet slide into nervous breakdown all the more appealing. Co-scriptwriter Adam Gierasch, who plays the building's maintenance man Ned, is also quite wonderful. (In fact, to me the film's biggest failing is that more wasn't done with Ned's character.) Most of the rest of the cast are at least competent, if not stellar.

Tobe Hooper's best film in the past two decades. *** ",1198108800,,3446,4.8338983050847455
2206385,3,B00079HZY8,"Nothing to see here folks move along, move along. This movie is about an apartment building with a sordid past, built by an eccentric with ties to the cult. Apparantly hidden within the building is another building where the killer can appear in anyone's room at will for a random killing. Hence the title, he uses hammers, nail guns, and electric saws as choice of weapons.

This flick stars Angela Bettis, you may remember her from the movie 'May'. She's the actress who after watching for 90 minutes you still cannot decide if she is attractive or not. Her and her doctor husband move into the building where the walls are so thin you can hear your neighbors at all times. Whether they are fighting, screwing, or sing songs about summer, it does not matter you can hear it all.

Angela has a lot of time on her hands because of her husbands internship. She explores the building after the disappearance of her friend, weird symblols throughout the layout, and the 'discovery' of room numbers that do not exist. She even goes to town hall and studies the blueprints. Finally her, her husband, the landlord, and Carlos the doorman face the building's killer. The landlord gets his spine cut, and Carlos ends up with his face burned off.

Well they leave the movie open for a sequal after the killer survives being crushed, shot, and thrown out a window, but hopefully it never comes to be.

The killer is not much to speak of and not strong enough to make a franchise out of like Jason or Freddy. He was pulled from the womb of his dead mother and keeps his face wrapped in some sort of black cloth. Whoever this dude is he has some weird teeth.

2206388,4,B00079HZY8,"Tobe Hooper, the creator of the legendary ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" returns to the horror scene with a remake of the 1970s sleaze classic ""Toolbox Murders"". No. I have seen the original ""Toolbox Murders,"" and I can safely tell you that this remake has absolutely nothing to do with the original film. The two movies aren't even close in subject matter. The shiny new ""Toolbox Murders"" is not even a ""reimagining,"" one of those tricky Hollywood terms we horror fans hear quite a bit these days. Reimagining implies that crucial elements from the first outing will appear in the remake. Sure, both versions of the ""Toolbox Murders"" deal with a sleaze ball systematically working his way through a bevy of female flesh with instruments pulled out of his trusty Black & Decker tool chest. That's where the similarity between the two movies ends. It's the underlying plots that separate the two flicks by a distance that spans continents. So let's not delude ourselves into thinking Hooper's 2004 picture is a remake of the 1978 video nasty, o.k.? Now that we got that out of the way, I will say this film marks a return of sorts for Tobe Hooper. Read on to find out why.

""Toolbox Murders"" introduces us to Nell and Steven Barrows (Angela Bettis and Brent Roam) as they quickly find themselves in an extremely unpleasant situation. Steve went ahead and rented an apartment in the distinguished Lusman Arms apartment complex, located in good old Hollywood, California, without giving Nell much of a say in the matter. So what's wrong with that? One, only a newly married guy would make such a decision without consulting his wife. Two, the Lusman Arms looks more like a Howard Johnson's in Baghdad than an apartment building. The structure is literally falling apart. Junk seems piled everywhere, nothing works from the elevator on down, and the denizens of the building would be out of place in the Twilight Zone. Steven doesn't think it's too bad, but he's a doctor and doesn't have to hang around in the building like poor Nell does. Within minutes our heroine senses something amiss in the building. She hears all sorts of disturbing noises and, even worse, notices that neighbors start disappearing. Then there are the strange runes and symbols on the walls. Oh dear. Of course, no one believes Nell when she voices her concerns. And why would they? This is a horror movie!

One thing leads to another and we soon see Nell starting a serious investigation into the origins and subsequent existence of the Lusman Arms compound. The picture that emerges is decidedly grim. Remember all those cryptic runes on the walls in the building? Turns out they represent some sort of spell. It also turns out that a space exists inside the building, a very old space nearly inaccessible to the building's ignorant tenants. I won't offer up any serious spoilers that would ruin the conclusion of the film, but I can talk about the gory happenings that occur while Nell works her way to a solution. Our girl's neighbors meet their ends in seriously messed up ways. We see a hammer meeting a skull, an interesting take on the requisite nail gun killing, a real nasty band saw atrocity, a drill bit through the head, and a melting face gag that looks quite nifty. I'm not going to waste time describing the cast of characters largely because most of them stand around until it's time for them to die. Rance Howard shows up as a long time resident with knowledge about the building, and Juliet Landau has a small part as Nell's only friend in the building whose disappearance spurs our protagonist into action.

I liked ""Toolbox Murders"" for a number of reasons. I can't get enough Angela Bettis in my diet, for starters. I think she's very pretty and an excellent actress, although I'm worried about her thin frame. Anyway, seeing her put her talents to use in the lead role helps the movie immensely. I enjoyed the gory kills, obviously, but I also liked the film's atmosphere. The decrepit Lusman Arms serves as the perfect backdrop for a slasher flick, and Hooper takes good advantage of this creepy structure throughout the movie. Even the look of the film, mainly the somber lighting, gives the movie credibility that most slashers sorely lack. So much for the good. The bad includes a too large cast, a confusing conclusion, and a few plot holes you could sail an ocean liner through. For example, Nell discovers that a certain room on every floor of the building doesn't seem to appear on any blueprints. When she tells the building manager, he says something along the lines of, ""I never noticed that before."" WHAT? How is that even remotely plausible, let alone possible? These problems aside, I think the positives far outweigh the negatives. Hooper did a good job with this movie.

The DVD version of ""Toolbox Murders"" comes to us with a great picture transfer and good audio quality. Extras on the disc include a very short behind the scenes featurette that doesn't really tell us much about what went on during the shoot. We also get two commentary tracks, one with Hooper and screenwriters Adam Gierasch and Jace Anderson that's worth a listen. The second one, with two of the film's producers, isn't as good. Also included for our amusement are five deleted/extended scenes, a few of which show us the gore excised from the R-rated cut of the film. Previews for other films, along with an odd one-minute feature that shows Hooper telling a story onstage somewhere, round out the disc. I highly recommend spending some time with ""Toolbox Murders"". It's a fun, creepy, gory ride that does credit to a filmmaker who's spent most of his career churning out clunkers. Welcome back, Tobe!",1179014400,2,5683,4.790010193679919

Angela Bettis (May, Girl Interrupted) is fantastic as the clever heroine.  She is smart, ballsy and has just the right dose of neurosis, without being whiny and annoying.

The atmosphere of the creepy building with its weird history is great (think Dark Water w/Jennifer Connoly but better).  The characters are all interesting and have purpose in the movie.

There is a little bit of everything going on and it all comes together nicely.  Kind of a quick wrap up ending with not much explanation, but it doensn't detract from the movie.

2206390,1,B00079HZY8,"You know what's depressing? The sheer amount of horror remakes that have flooded the market in recent years. From the J-Horror Americanised versions to the glut of 70's and 80's retellings, it's like the movie business has run out of ideas altogether. Especially when they start scraping the barrel and churning out bilge like this.

To be honest, I haven't seen the original 70's movie, but I can only assume it's better than this. Hell, pulling your toenails out with pliers is probably better than this. For a start - it makes NO sense. There are so many unanswered questions and plot black holes, you're not so much hiding behind your fingers as counting the indiscrepancies on them. There's a whole host of things, like magic symbols and rapping on walls that adds to absolutely NOTHING, it makes you wonder just how many people were writing this movie. They almost certainly weren't working on the same one.

Then there's the killer himself, ""Coffin Baby"", a feeble attempt at a franchise villain if ever there was. The thing is, the movie attempts to make the film a who-dunnit, with loads of supposedly sinister and creepy red herrings floating around the hotel in an effort to make us think - ""ah - he did it"", except we don't, not once, not only because the DVD box has the killer on the front, but the movie has him running around the hotel at the start. Kinda kills the suspense, that.

Add the fact it nails every single horror movie clich&eacute;, and some fairly diabolical acting, and you're looking at one of the worst horror movies of the decade. Some nice gore, I suppose, but is that really enough anymore?

2206396,4,B00079HZY8,"Tobe Hooper's ""Toolbox Murders"" is one of those horror films where it becomes a running battle to see if the good parts are going to outweigh the bad by the time we get to the final credits. Since at the end of this 2004 film I was remembering the good parts rather more than the bad parts, I end up rounding up on this film. Ironically the last time I saw a horror film that managed to creep me out as much it was the recent remake of Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" The good parts in this more are visual rather than narrative (to be specific, the nail gun victim is the one that keeps sticking out in my mind), which is why I think the director gets the credit for making this B-movie worth watching late at night in the dark. But while I think the hits outweigh the misses here, I certainly recognize that many horror fans but end up thinking the scale tips the other way on this one, which just reflects the problems with contemporary horror movies.

Nell Barrows (Angela Bettis) and her doctor husband, Steven (Brent Roam), move into the Lusman Arms apartment hotel. The place has certainly seen beter days, but it is the nights that Nell has to worry about. The Lusman Arms is crawling with quirk neighbors and with Steven working doctor's hours she has plenty of time to be alone and let her imagination get the better of her. The cops are tired of her calling them about somebody screaming bloody murder, which is when the bloody murders start happening. So Nell investigates on her own, which is how she discovers that the Lusman Arms has some interesting architectural secrets in its history. When Nell makes the classic mistake of going through the secret door she discovers, Hooper really starts going through his bag of cinematic tricks, the best of which the location (e.g., the stairwell).

Apparently this is a remake of the 1978 misogynistic splatter flick ""The Toolbox Murders,"" which also involved a masked killer in an apartment building disposing of tenants with whatever tools he had at his disposal (apparently this is all loosely based on a true story, which may mean nothing more than at one point in history somebody in an apartment building killed somebody with a tool from a box). Besides the killer and his motivation the key difference is the use of the location, which in this case is actually the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, the site of the first Academy Awards and the place where Robert F. Kennedy was shot. Screenwriters Jace Anderson and Adam Gierasch come up more than a list of tools to be used in the killings in this one with their building inside the building along with some attempts to confound expectations based on conventions of the genre. Unfortunately the explanation for the killer is one of those silly ideas that only makes sense if you insist on having an explanation and do not mind it being stupid (although Coffin Baby is certainly different as the name for the maniacal killer).

Fortunately the cast is above average for this type of film and most of the characters are given specific bits so you could think that they might be the killer behind the mask, which is just another way the script is having fun with the genre. I ended up watching it because I discovered Juliet Landau was in the cast, although she was given nothing that would make anybody forget her marvelous turns as Drusilla on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" But she is out of the picture before we get to the final act of ""Toolbox Murders,"" which is the point where Hooper puts Nell through the wringer and shows what the director of a low-budget horror film can do. Bettis makes for an interesting heroine because she is smart enough to get herself into trouble but not smart enough to get herself out. Plus the art direction by Steven R. Miller, set decoration by Peggy Paola, and sculptures by Mark Shostrom make it so that even when Coffin Baby is not around Nell has ample reason to be just as freaked out as when he is there behind her with one of his tools (although notice that his choice for her is not something that would ever fit in a toolbox).",1132963200,2,4092,4.5646258503401365
2206397,3,B00079HZY8,"Recently I've been trying to figure out for myself exactly what I enjoy about horror movies and how it is that I come to love some, laugh at some, and yawn at most. After seeing Toolbox Murders the remake, I'm starting to understand what it is exactly that makes a horror film work for me and what makes some of them laughably bad. I watched this movie with no notion of what it was about and found myself riveted. As you watch, you really don't have a sense of who the killer is at all, you figure the maintenance guy is the obvious red herring so you rule him out, and the film doesn't give you any real idea of what you're dealing with.  The murder scenes are creative and you start to wonder why more filmmakers haven't used nailguns,  drills or table saws as their weapons of choice as they are seemingly logical items to use in serial killing. LOL. But when the story line seems to be taking you down a path of the usual slasher psychopath, it suddenly turns and becomes the supernatural, leaving you with lots of questions and wondering who and what the killer is exactly. You never do get the answer to these questions and that, for me, is what I love about certain horror films. I LIKE unanswered questions in horror, especially when there IS no explanation for things; that is what makes some horror really disturbing and others just plain cliche and stupid. This is a fine line however, as some films throw a bunch of garbage in the movie that makes no sense and expect the audience to come up with a solution that isn't there but this can be done cleverly so it works, as it does in Toolbox Murders. For me, I like when everyday things are turned into mazes of confusion and I enjoy being led down one path only to discover I have ended up somewhere else.

The story begins with a married couple (May's Angela Bettis and Brent Roam) moving into an apartment in a run down one time hotel in Hollywood.  Needless to say that strange noises (particularly hammering) in the middle of the night, the fact that nothing works right, and some inadequate maintenance men, make things somewhat distressing for the couple.  And when tenants start getting picked off by a masked murderer using various tools, well, that just adds to the headaches.  Hooper goes for the 70's style scares and jolts that are still apparent in horror movies today, but it doesn't work here.  What does work here are some great gore effects and some creative kills, which elevate Toolbox Murders from the rest of the slasher heap.

Gore is a highly overrated element in horror, but it does have its place. Hooper is well aware of this and exercises excellent restraint and timing. All great writers and directors know that every scene should be the best scene in the movie.  Thus, you'll find little fluff in this masterful piece.

In a rental, everything bites: the sh*tty fixtures and furnishings. The sluggish and surly maintenance. The utilities, the lights, the A/C, the laundryroom that doubles as a hangout for serial killers. And the noise of those anonymous, annoying, transient tenants: the banging, the shuffling, the scuffling, the midnight dime-dropping just over your head, calculated to drive you crazy. And worse, far more obvious noises.

I had a pad in Washington DC once upon a time where all the signs were lettered in six languages (including Farsi and Urdu) and the halls stank of rotten meat. No kidding. I've had a landlord barge in at 3 in the morning to fix his own leaky pipes that hadn't been replaced or maintained since the death of the Dodo.

I think we can all agree: rentals s*ck, and Hell really is Other People.

And if that's the case, then the doomed Lusman Arms of Tobe Hooper's bloodthirsty little ""Toolbox Murders"", occupies one of the lowest rungs of the Abyss.

Case in point: mousey little teacher-in-waiting Nell Barrows (the usually superb but---at least in 'Toolbox'---supremely annoying Angela Bettis)and med-intern hubby (some cookie-cutter actor who is as odorless & colorless as water vapor) move into a derelict tenement in downtown L.A. He goes to work, she stays behind to get things in order.

You know, get things in order: that means deal with the ugly apartment building (actually the Ambassador Hotel, where Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. was blown to ribbons---a really depressing place to enter Glory, all things considered) and its bizarro inhabitants, avoid the uber-creepy maintenance guy, conduct renter's brinkmanship with the passive-aggressive landlord Byron (veteran character actor Greg Travis, who steps it down a notch and delivers the goods here), and generally make herself miserable.

To make it a little weirder: the Lusman's tenants have this damned annoying habit of disappearing.

Seriously. As if the walls just opened up and swallowed them whole.

Which might not be far from the truth. The glorious part of ""Toolbox Murders"", which is a deliciously old-school romp into gore, depravity, sadism, and outright horrific nastiness, is the mystery at the guts of this depressed, flickering, shadowy, dilapidated old hulk of a building. Tobe Hooper takes the standard slasher opus and ratchets it up to the next level by splicing its genes with that of another great chestnut of the horror genre: the Strange Old Building with a Nasty Past.

See, back in the 1940s, the Lusman's architect and financier wanted to put together his own little Hollywood Enclave: a pleasure palace where the stars of the Silver Screen would congregate, make noise, and drive the profits to the stars. Didn't happen: LA sprawled south and east and west, and the big money---and big names---sprawled with the City.

Supposedly---hush, the walls have ears---this financier walled himself, and an entire townhouse, into the guts of the Lusman. Into the walls, man, you know---and then disappeared. And now that the renovations---a wall torn down here, a room expanded there---are going on, things have been happening. In the shadows. In the dark.

And that is to say *nothing* of the bumps, and creaks, and bizarre shuffling and thumping, upstairs, downstairs and amidships, nasty noises made by at least one transient, mysterious resident who doesn't give a damn about noise ordinances.

It's enough to drive you crazy. And if not you---well, somebody, you follow me? Maybe even enough to nail the next-door neighbor to the ceiling of her little pied-a-terres, yeah? Sure.

What *is* it with the apartment building that brings out the downright ghoulish in folks, anyway? From the devil-haunted Bram in ""Rosemary's Baby"" to the parasite-infested Starliner Towers of ""Shivers"", from the genteel and gentle voyeurism of ""Rear Window"" to the nastier techno-version of ""Splinter""---apartment living brings out the worst in us.

Maybe because we realize we're not living in communities, but hives.

Or maybe---just maybe---it's because at some fundamental level, we realize we're paying off somebody elses's mortgage. The B*stards.

Tobe Hooper takes all this emotional baggage and runs with it: ""Toolbox Murders"" is genuinely creepy and deliciously shot: it's also decisively merciless. When's the last time you saw somebody strapped down and given an acid facial? Yeah, it has been a long time.

But the darksome thing that makes ""Toolbox"" loom up fearfully over its tiresome Hollywood rivals is its weirdness, that wicked X-factor that propels its tool wielding psychopath to exact brutal terror on his victims. The walls have ears, and signs and totems and sigils, too. Buildings, like people, have hates, and envies, and furies, and lusts. Buildings have power: and the older, the more furious and powerful and saturnine.

Check in? Why not? Sign the lease? I'd hold off, if I were you.

Most of the characters are poor stereotypes and there's really no chemistry between the two leads.  Probably the most interesting character is the mother of the peeping Tom--and she had all of about 30 seconds in the movie!

2206406,3,B00079HZY8,"In the opinion of this certified horror fan, 2003's Toolbox Murders falls far short of greatness.  I've never been a Tobe Hooper fan, and this supposed resurrection of his horror career does nothing to change my way of thinking.  I always feel weird when I go against the opinion of some great horror fans, but I cannot understand the accolades heaped upon Angela Bettis for her performance here.  I found her character incredibly annoying and, if anything, a negative influence on the film.  I had problems with other characters, as well.  In addition, I would have liked to have a little more information on the source of all the horror here.  I haven't seen the Toolbox Murders film from 1978 (which apparently does differ significantly from Hooper's ""reimagining"" of it), but this new film itself seems mired in the 1970s, giving the fright scenes a predictability that renders them benign and, in a sense, boring.

The story takes place in the Lunsford Hotel, which is full of ""history"" and ""character"" (which means it's begging to be condemned by this point).  Steve and Nell Barrows (Brent Roam and Angela Bettis) move into the place and quickly realize that signing the lease was a big mistake.  Nothing works right, the whole place is supposedly being remodeled (which apparently means the crud is being shifted around against a backdrop of constant hammering), the landlord is a prissy jerk, the maintenance man is one step up from a Neanderthal, and the residents are weird and loud.  Nell begins hearing things left and right, but everyone treats her like she's just paranoid.  When she actually makes a friend, said friend quickly disappears, and Nell is convinced something happened to her.  She explores the history of the building, finding out that the strange symbols all over the place actually represent some kind of spell.  Like an idiot, she explores the mystery up-close and gets a lot of people killed by the inhuman murderer (whose identity I can guess but not confirm).  The fright scenes might make some folks jump once or twice, but the ""look out behind you"" tactics of the 1970s just aren't that impressive here in the twenty-first century.

Alongside several holes in the plot, a lot of details bothered me.  First and foremost, what husband is going to lease an apartment without talking to his wife first - that's a recipe for marital unhappiness in and of itself.  Then you have Nell going down to wash clothes on the night the Barrows move in.  Who, I ask you, brings along dirty clothes on a move and insists on washing them before unpacking has really even begun?  And that incredibly weird maintenance man Ned - talk about your obvious suspect.

We're missing what's really important here, though.  That would be the inclusion of Juliet Landau, the sexiest vampire to ever grace the screen (as Drusilla in the Buffyverse).  She was certainly one of my main motivations for seeing this film.  Much to my surprise, though, she has nothing of the Drusilla aura about her, looking quite pale and sickly early on (except when compared to the emaciated Angela Bettis).  Still, she brings a presence to the film that no other character begins to match.

I don't have a problem with the gore - you can never have too much gore, in my opinion.  It would have been nice if the lighting had actually allowed me to see more of it, but I appreciate it being there.  Sadly, that's about all there is to this movie, though - gore and 70s-style scares.  The Lunsford building doesn't even have a strong presence of evil (despite the fact that the actual location is the Ambassador Hotel where RFK was assassinated) - it's just too depressing to be scary.  I'm glad that some other horror fans enjoyed this movie, but Toolbox Murders just didn't do all that much for me.",1118966400,12,3789,4.7684049079754605

This little gem is a must for those interested in going behind the scenes of these movies, very nicely done!

2206409,3,B00079HZY8,"One of the respected horror directors Tobe Hooper comes back with the star Angela Bettis ('May' and TV's 'Carrie').  This 'Toolbox Murders' is a remake of the 1978 film of the same title, in which a killer uses various items in ... er ... the toolbox.  Though the gimmick itself is unchanged, the new version gives more stress upon the spooky atmosphere coming from the well-chosen locations.  And Ms. Bettis (I really like her) is a real talent, which is a bonus to the film.

The film is about the married couple newly moving in a decaying apartment building in LA.  The place is surely spooky, and looks either infested with evil spirits, or just tenanted by a bunch of strange, slightly crazy inmates.  As you know, so many people come to Hollywood with dreams, and if you are acting like a little bit starnge, no one cares.  Even if you suddenly vanish.

But Angela Bettis's heroine plucky Nell notices something different,  What is the dirty package hidden behind the wall of her room?  What do the marks signify engraved on the floor of the building?  The film slowly builds up the story.

[GREAT LOCATION] Tobe Hooper chose The Ambassador Hotel, now closed, where Robert Kennedy was assassinated.  I don't know how many films in the past used this building as location, but in this Hooper's new film the place becomes the spookiest.  In usual places, an officious manager or a creepy repairman is a big no-no cliche; in here, they look so real that you might feel that Hooper is talking about an old-fashioned ghost story, not a serial killer horror.  (But actually, it is a serial killer story.)

However, Hooper's 'Toolbox Murders' is not perfect.  The third and final act suffers from confusing cat-and-mouse situations, and when you can solve the mysterious writings simply by, say, opening a book or two, what is the point of its being a mystery?  The spooky atmosphere slowly vanishes from the air, which I regret very much.

But thanks to the good acting from Angela Bettis (whose debut was 'The Sparrow' directed by Franco Zeffirelli!), the film remains interesting.  And a few bits from Rance Howard (Ron's dad) as the oldest tenant recounting the golden age of Hollywood add precious touch of credibility to the film.",1114819200,12,2235,4.770833333333333
2206410,3,B00079HZY8,"Angela Bettis plays Nell, a lonely housewife on the verge of cracking up in Tobe Hooper's effective yet bland remake of the 1978 low-budgeter THE TOOLBOX MURDERS.  One thing is for sure, this film is ten times better than its original, even more worthy than many direct-to-video releases out there.  But as a whole, the delivery is plain gray.  There are many pivotal scenes that will guarantee fright (most noticeably the newly thinned victim attack, which will definitely make one think twice before entering a dark apartment).  Hooper directs them with a sharp eye and a gusto attitude (check out also his Bonus Feature's uncut scenes).  It's a joy to see the man at work.  What he lacks however is a strong script.  As interesting THE TOOLBOX MURDERS tries to be, the movie as a whole is plot free.  A whodunit, yes, but one which doesn't really go anywhere.  This may work as a low-budget biggie for an unknown director, but since Hooper is the mastermind behind such gems as Poltergeist and The (original) Chainsaw Massacre, a lot more is at stakes.  His involvement in THE TOOLBOX MURDERS should have definitely deserved a better treatment.-----Martin Boucher",1114646400,,1166,4.903061224489796

The actual remake part of the story, i.e. people getting hacked to death in an apartment building, is by the numbers; however, the surrounding mysteries of the building's history and the links the architect had to the occult, are very intriguing and build a good amount of creepiness and suspense.

2206415,4,B00079HZY8,"But then again, eating paste would be better than the original Toolbox Murders which was an ultra cheap, exploitative piece of crap.  Tobe Hooper's remake goes in a bit of a different direction combinging the supernatural with the slasher to create an odd, but fairly effective horror film about a historic Hollywood hotel that's being rennovated as an appartment complex.  It seems that since the rennovations began people have been dying but also the building has a long history of maintenance men and construction workers getting killed or disappearing.

Into the building comes Nell (Angela Bettis of ""May"") and her husband Steven who is a doctor.  Why anyone would move into a dump of a building like this is quite beyond me, but they do and immediately Nell doesn't like it.  The manager is creepy, the maintenance Ned, even moreso, the neighbors next door fight all the time, and Nell has just found a box containing human teeth in a hole in the wall.  I think I'd tend to ask for my deposit back once human remains were found in my home.

While this is going on a ski-masked man is making short work of other residents, killing them with claw hammers, nail guns, saws, and in one scene Julia (Juliet landau of Buffy fame) gets a drill in the back of the head that comes out through her mouth.  When Julia turns up missing, the buildings oldest resident Chas (played by Rance Howard, father of Ron) tells Nell to look for Julia in apartment 504.  Problem is there is no 504, or 404, or 304, etc.  On each floor the same room is missing.

Nell soon learns of the mysterious history of the building and how those who built it were into black magic and that strange symbols on the walls throughout the building are part of a spell.  Nell goes exploring and finds that there is a secret building within the building itself and home to someone, or something, that has littered this secret den with dozens of corpses, new and old.

Toolbox Murders is a competantly made film.  Bettis gives a fine performance as the witty heroine although Brent Roam as her husband is the standard dullard husband who passes off Nells claims as imagination.  Hooper gives us some rather gory murder scenes although I would not say they were overly gratuitous.  Thankfully Hooper did not feel the need to rely on nudity by the female stars just for the sake of it like so many other horror movies do.

There are some nagging questions that went unaswered such as just whose teeth those were in the wall and why were they there in the first place?  And how did this killer survive all those decades before the rennovations turned him loose again and what was the character of Chas's relationship with the killer?  That aside I enjoyed ToolBox Murders.  The rundown hotel was a sufficiently creepy setting and the supernatural elements made this more than just another slasher film.",1113782400,2,2863,4.654075546719682

2206418,2,B00079HZY8,"I feel bad for Tobe Hooper having to live out the rest of his directing career in the shadow of his first film, the horror masterpiece that was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He really hasn't done much that could ever compete with that. I mean he has done a few decent films here and there, but he really has started to go down hill in last decade or so. Toolbox Murders further demonstrates my point.

Toolbox Murders literally offers nothing except gore (which is fine, in fact the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars were its killing sequences). I don't care if it is a remake or not. The storyline just gave this movie very little leverage as far as what could be done with it. 98% of this movie takes place in an apartment building. What can you do with a setting like that? Maybe it worked well in 1978, but not now. Mainly because of it restraining setting is why this movie didn't allowed for anything interesting or watchable to happen. I was completely bored to death inbetween the killing sequences. It just seemed so lame to me, watching this woman search around and investigate this apartment like it was supposed to be interesting or enthralling. Boring. Maybe if it was The Apartment Building On Haunted Hill or something and they actually did something the setting rather than having some old apartment building in the middle of Hollywood.

More criticism, everything in this movie was so dark, especially towards the end. And not dark like scary dark, dark like ""Wow I wish I could see what the heck is happening."" The movie just seemed poorly filmed to me.

And lastly, what a dumb title. I would've at least had the dignity to change the name from the original so that people might actually be interested in seeing it rather than being ""That sounds retarded.""",1113264000,2,1778,4.584905660377358
2206419,4,B00079HZY8,"It's a half way decent horror movie. Way better than some of the ones I have been watching lately. I thought it was going to be a 5 star until it slowly crept along towards the ending. Good horror movie, but here are the problems: (1) you have very good actors/actresses mixed in with some really bad ones, and the contrast really stands out (2) It had some slow spots, it was slow to the punch, but when it finally did punch it was awesome. (3) A terrible ending (like a lot of new movies these days) I won't elaborate and ruin it, you will just have to see it.
With all that aside, it does have some great points (4) my favorite point - the gore! They just don't make them like this any more. It filled my gore meter. Some of the scenes in this were just breath taking. A gore master piece. (5) Angela Bettis is a good actress, I like her roll in horror movies. She always does a good job (6) good picture and sound on the DVD (who knows what you will get with these B-horror movies.)

2206420,4,B00079HZY8,"Going into this movie having seen the original 1978 film of the same name, I knew that with Tobe Hooper on board there was no possible way that it could be worse than the original. The 1978 film boasts that it was banned since 1982 but I don't understand why. The film itself crams all of the kills within the first 20 minutes. While they are decent, they are nothing to be banned for. But times have changed. So did the remake of ""The Toolbox Murders"" achieve ""better than the original"" status. Definitely. There are few similarities to the original film here. The killers attire is pretty much one in the same. Very simple ski mask and all black clothing. The killing methods are toolbox related and all of the tools used in the original are back...and then some. But the similarities stop there. The films are totally different from here on.

The cast was good though the only one I really recognized was Sherri Moon (House of 1000 Corpses). While here roll is very brief it was great to see her in another film. The lead character Nell, played by Angela Bettis (The Carrie Remake) was played very well. She was very realistic in the roll but was annoying. She's just the kind of person who is hard to like. Nell and her husband Steven have moved to Hollywood where Nell is an out of work teacher and Steven is a doctor/med student. The duo move into an old building called the Lusman building. The Building is a dark, run down building going through renovations. It is made evident that the building has a past that goes deeper than anyone could ever imagine. The Lusman building is loaded with all sorts of wacky over the top characters that we get to meet and learn about early on from the weird building manager, Ned the creepy repairman, Julie the exercise obsessed former fat chick, Saffron the freaky hippie chick, a family with a perverted teenage son, and Charles, who having lived in the building since 1947 pretty much has things figured out around there. Most of the people living in the building are aspiring actors being as though the film is set in Hollywood. So basically what starts going down is simple. A killer starts knocking off people one after the other using various power tools. When done correctly...it doesn't get much better than that!

The film seems that it might have slightly suffered from a rushed script but it definitely is a film, that thanks to the kills, delivers. Toolbox Murders definitely has that old school feel of the 70's and 80's slasher flicks and that is something to be appreciated. While sometimes a little over the top there isn't as much comic relief as in some slashers which is nice as the film doesn't make fun of itself often. We get to see all sorts of tools used as murder weapons from hammers, nail guns, drills, saw and more! The bigger difference in the kills in this movie and the original is the pacing. They aren't crammed in a short time span. Plus, they are brutal. Believe me. They are gory and IN YOUR FACE which was great to see.

The ending moments really shine and you don't have to be a hardcore TCM fan to be able to see Tobe Hooper written all over this one. The killer even adopts some slight Leatherface mannerisms toward the end. The explanations at the end might make you say ""Huh?"" but it is still interesting and unique. While the final scenes seem abrupt and out of nowhere it is definitely old school horror goodness.

The overall presentation of the film is excellent. The camera work is slightly shaky and a throwback to that of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The score is simple and effective. Great stuff.

While some say that remakes never equal the original blue print, ""Toolbox Murders"" is definitely an exception. I don't know if it should even be called a remake but if you refer to it in that manner, it definitely needs to be placed near the top of the remake ranks.

FINAL ANALYSIS: This film was finished in 2003 and the release has been longe delayed for whatever reasons. It's finally here and it's too bad that it had to skip theatres. But that could have been a blessing in all honesty. A theatrical run could have resulted in the movie company trimming it down to get a PG 13 rating and that would have ruined a brutal film like this. So how will you know if you will like this film if you don't know from the review already? If you like old school horror/slasher films....if you are a person who doesn't expect every movie to be an academy award winning masterpiece...if you crave straight up in your face slasher goodness....Toolbox Murders is your film.

2206422,4,B00079HZY8,"Genre director Tobe Hooper has made a couple of great horror films (TCM, Poltergeist) and a whole truckload of average ones (TCM2, Mangler, Crocodile).  It's a sad thing when the last notable great film you've made dates back to 1982 but that has been Hooper's career so far.  One thing I respect with the guy however is that he has never abandoned the genre that made him famous in the first place and has not shied away from splashing generous amounts of blood on our screens.  Given his recent celluloid history, I wasn't too sure about his reworking of &#8220;The Toolbox Murders&#8221;, a trashy 70's flick that was never any good in the first place and whose sole claim to fame was that it just happened to be one of Stephen King's personal favorites.

The Lusman Arms Hotel in Hollywood, CA provides affordable rent in a historically overpriced market.  Many of its tenants are wanna-be actors and models in search of the California dream.  Truth is the place is a real rathole: paper-thin walls with holes in them, brown water shooting out of the faucets, crack whores, drug dealers, smudge & grime everywhere.  But if you're in Hollywood and forced to live on a budget where else will you go?  For Nell (Angela Bettis) and her husband Steven, a young couple in a transitionary phase of life, the Lusman Arms is their best option.  But Nell is starting to find the place to be awfully noisy.  It soon becomes apparent to her that the power drill noise she keeps hearing is used for more than just repairs and that tenants are disappearing at an alarming rate.  Who's behind these toolbox murders?  The sleazy manager, the creepy repairman, the pimp next door?

&#8220;The Toolbox Murders&#8221; is argually the film us horror nuts have wanted Hooper to make ever since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Hooper goes straight for the throat here, delivering a grimy 70's style horror exploitation flick short on brains but high on brutality.  Gore fans will love the inventive kills as the killer shreds with a full arsenal including a hammer, nailgun, power drill, buzzsaw, pliers, screwdriver, the whole works.  Angela Bettis is absolutely stunning as the lead, able to switch from looking calm, to annoyed, to panicked, to determined.  You wouldn't expect great acting in a film like this but she pulls it off, just as she did in &#8220;May&#8221;.  Admittedly, &#8220;Toolbox Murders&#8221; is nothing we haven't seen before but yet it's exactly the type of picture us horror fans want to see.  Hooper manages to keep the sleazy  vibe of the original film intact while injecting it with a new supernatural bent.

He did a splendid job directing and was very pleased, but $20 is to much for this i would have been happier saving $5, but hey what ever. Give it a shot rent it first b4 you buy so you can pass judgement.",1111190400,,1228,3.923694779116466
2206424,2,B00079HZY8,"I looked forward to this movie for a year, and figured with Hooper at the helm and Angela Bettis, the star of ""May"" cast in the lead, it couldn't help but be amazing. I couldn't be more wrong! There are some awesome blood gags and beautiful photography. The killer was visually impressive with great make-up, but we didn't see enough of that beautiful ""Tortured Soul"" rip-off face featured in Fangoria.

Now we come to the story, or dare I say the complete lack thereof. There are plot points that attempt to add depth to the sexploitation premise, and none of them lead anywhere. The occult siguls, the hidden box of teeth, the cliche wise old man hinting at the building's occult history--none of it comes together or weaves into a coherent story. We're left at the end of the movie wondering why the killer kills, just what is it he gains from his victims, and must ask why he uses power tools for his sadistic murders if he is supposed to be draining life-force in some sort of infernal ritual.

""Toolbox Murders"" is like a porn movie that tries to be important, throws in a bit of dialogue, but just can't overcome the fact that it is a mindless skinshow--or in this case a mindless gore tank. And the movie does tank.  With the exception of Bettis, not one of the actors' performances are credible. For a far more entertaining sickfest with a VERY similar psycho, try Hooper's earlier film, ""Funhouse.""",1111190400,,1408,4.601593625498008
2206425,1,B00079HZY8,"I admire that instead of just re-making the original movie, they decided to get 'creative' with the script...but, in this case, they would have been better off to have stuck with the original story as what they came up with here is ridiculous!

There is not enough back story on the killer, so, we never really know who is is and why he is doing all the killing, the same with the building, we are told it is a 'spell', but, WHY was it built that way?

The acting/cast if fine, but it just seems like a bunch of random scenes were clumped together and called a movie.

....Definately rent, not buy, this one if you must see it just because it is a Tobe Hooper film.",1111017600,2,665,4.2204724409448815

A couple move into a decrepit apartment building and discover the buildings renovations stir up a sadistic murderer who is lurking in the building and begins to brutally murder the other tenants with power tools. Angela Bettis plays one of the new tenants who discovers the dark secret of the building. Tobe Hooper did a great job with this one and had a pretty decent cast, including Sheri Moon Zombie. Definitely worth buying!",1481846400,,458,4.884615384615385
8046194,3,B00079HZY8,"This movie is very gory. I'm not a fan of strong gory movies. This movie has a Texas Chainsaw feel to it. Hence Tobe Hooper being involved.

Not seen the original yet but this movie is fairly decent. Average acting. Way over the top murders but as I say decent.",1480204800,,261,4.22

8046196,4,B00079HZY8,"Not quite a remake of the original, little of the plot remains.  In this version, a couple move into a creepy apartment building, formerly a hotel.  Someone is killing the tenants with power tools and spiriting them away.  The lead character is an obnoxious neurotic (Angela Bettis as Nell Barrows).  She is overly suspicious about everything, at one point calling the police because she thinks something bad is happening in another apartment (a case of bad acting, as an actor is working on his lines).  Then she receives a clue from another tenant (Rance Howard) concerning a missing woman.  Look for her in room 504.  There is no 504.  In fact, theres no 104, 204, 304, or 404.  She steals a set of blueprints and goes looking where she shouldnt.  She finds more than she bargained for and others pay the consequences.

Not bad for its type.  Once it gets going its quite absorbing.  But.  Theres a few too many jump scares and a few too many red herrings (when all the characters are decidedly creepy, how do you pick out a killer?).  And the overkill ending was entirely expected.  Still.  Highly entertaining.",1478908800,,1115,4.694300518134715
