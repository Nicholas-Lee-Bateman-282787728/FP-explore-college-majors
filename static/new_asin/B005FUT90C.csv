were portrayed by children in the ballet.
He has cerebral palsy and had a walk on role in a local ballet..This imaginative  DVD has cemented his love of ballet and classical music
Enjoyed by the entire family!! Bravo!",1389830400,,332,4.824561403508772
4686065,3,B005FUT90C,"Loved the music since I was a child; adore the ballet; however, this is far too much money for a 30 minute dvd...",1356652800,2,113,3.9565217391304346
4686066,5,B005FUT90C,"This recording made at the end of 2011 finally brings this popular ballet production from as long ago as 1995 to our screens. The intention was to include as many children as possible in the production and thus to incorporate the widest possible range of ages from the ballet school as possible. This was an immediate success and continues to be so.

There is an interesting short bonus film in which Matthew Hart, the choreographer, explains his intentions and these are copiously illustrated using extracts from the rehearsal sessions. During this film there are short interviews with a number of the children portraying the key characters as well as comments from Sergei Polunin as the wolf and Will Kemp, who takes on the combined role of the grandfather and narrator.

Large numbers of children are also involved by using them to take on parts of the scenery such as the meadow, the trees, the wall and the pond. This is a most imaginative use of the cast and is most effective and William Hart pays tribute to the contributing influences behind his ideas such as those derived from George Balanchine and Kenneth MacMillan.

The production is clearly filmed with crisp detail and good rendition of the many colours to be found throughout the production in the imaginative costumes. The sound is presented in excellent DTS 5.1 as well as in stereo.

In addition to the short bonus referred to above, there is also the usual cast gallery typical of this label.

The packed audience, full of mesmerised children, is fully appreciative of the occasion and is a good indication of the likely success of this recording. The limited playing time is reflected in the slightly reduced price range.

This is a perennially popular musical story by Prokofiev and has been retold in a wide variety of ways since 1936, the date of composition. This present concept featuring the students of the Royal Ballet School is totally delightful and completely professional.  The whole combination of attractions presented here combine to make it very likely that purchasers will get considerable pleasure from it for themselves and for any children they know for a very long time. It seems totally reasonable therefore to rate this as a full 5 star issue.",1346630400,7,2238,4.904761904761905
4686067,5,B005FUT90C,"I recently purchased this video of the Royal School of Ballet performing Peter and the Wolf to show to my music classes. I teach K-6 music in elementary school. I showed it in my K-3 classes (and even to one of my advanced bands, 5th and 6th graders), starting with an introduction to the instruments they would hear and a brief synopsis of the story. They LOVED it!!! During the viewing one kindergartner whispered to his classroom teacher, ""This is a really good story!"" The quality of the production is excellent, the dancing and costuming wonderful and imaginative, the characters animated and relatable. The narration keeps them well aware of the story line. It provides students and children with a great introduction to ballet and music in general.",1324598400,22,755,4.90625
4686068,4,B005FUT90C,"Peter and the Wolf, with legendary music by Prokofiev, and choreography by Matthew Hart, is danced by (primarily) students of the Royal Ballet School. The enjoyability of this ballet demands a certain context: if viewed as an intellectual and intricate new story ballet, it falls flat. If viewed as a homey children's ballet, it excels. The most brilliant thing about the production is the music, created by the legendary Sergei Prokofiev in 1936. The choreography is inventive and modern, illustrating the story very well. What makes the production come together is Will Kemp's narration of the human and animal characters (including the different instruments that identify with each character), as well as his role as the grandfather. The wolf is danced by Sergei Polunin. Though not an especially technical role, dramatically, Polunin does it well. The other dancers, students of the Royal Ballet School, are cast and dance so well that at times, it's as if one is viewing the dancers of the Royal Opera House itself. Though minimalistic, the sets and lighting well-suit the ballet, adding to it's homey charm. The ballet is also fairly short, just around a half an hour, another reason why children would love it. The filming is excellent, and if viewed as a children's classic, the ballet is exceptional, if not ideal.

I'd recommend this to anyone with the desire to step towards bringing the world of ballet to their children, if not for the sake of revisiting their own homey children's tales.",1322438400,26,1501,5.028112449799197
4686069,5,B005FUT90C,"This production of Peter and the Wolf - recorded at the Royal Ballet Theatre - features new choreography by Matthew Hart and stars Britain's Royal Ballet Theater principal dancer Sergei Polunin as the wolf. The Grandfather - and narrator - is played by Will Kemp. The rest of the cast are students at the Royal Ballet School. As Hart points out in the bonus 8-minute featurette, he wanted to have as many students on stage as possible, so he used them to create the lake (a la Busby Berkeley!) and the wall and the bushes. The costumes are very colorful and the 31-minute ballet moves quickly. This is a production that will appeal to children - who will relate to both the bright colors and the ages of the dancers.

Most of the movements are closer to Modern Dance than ballet. Polunin does leaps but there really is not a lot - if any- of pirouettes in the choreography.

The camera work is great and the image is sharp.

Another well-done DVD from Opus Arte

The dts sound stage is nicely spread out and the orchestra is very clear.  The choreography is cute and original.  The narrator is excellent.  Yes it is short but there is a ""making of"" extra which adds depth to the performance.  Two adults liked it very much -- the grandkids are too young yet but in a year or two they will get to see it.",1516060800,,458,4.267441860465116

8470691,5,B005FUT90C,"My grandsons, 2 & 5, adored this and we watched it 3 times the first day. The half hour length is perfect, and it is great to have a narrated ballet. The music has long been a favorite. I am so impressed by the excellent choreography, costumes and dancers. This was a great way to introduce children to the ballet and classical music.

I went on to buy the Royal Ballet's Alice in Wonderland - but it is 2 hours long and of course, not narrated. The boys haven't seen that yet, but I'm sure we'll have to show it in smaller doses, though it is beautifully performed and creative, as well.",1492560000,2,588,4.25
