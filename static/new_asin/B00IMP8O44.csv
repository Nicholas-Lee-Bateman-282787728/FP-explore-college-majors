8643394,4,B00IMP8O44,"This TVB drama series is from 1989. Yes, a very long time ago. I had already seen it back then. All I remember was I really enjoyed watching it!!

Although, the lead actor was Felix Wong, it was the young Hong Kong actor Deric Wan that was catapulted to fame!! DW was not only handsome, he was truly made for this role!!

I can not remember the storyline. However, as with any other well written drama/soap opera this was complicated & very entertaining!! I would highly recommend this to anyone!!

Honestly, I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend so much on something I've already seen. Well, I must say...it was well worth it!! For anyone who is familiar with TVB dramas/series, it's safe to say...that this will not disappoint!!

Furthermore, I'd like to thank the seller for their great customer service!! It was a pleasure to dealing with them. Thank you very much!! :)
