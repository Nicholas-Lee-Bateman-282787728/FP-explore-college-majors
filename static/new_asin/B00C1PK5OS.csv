8576316,4,B00C1PK5OS,"This 60-minute documentary tells the story of St. Bernadette Soubirous and her discovery of healing waters at Lourdes, France, with a special emphasis on the medical and scientific process of verifying miraculous cures at the shrine today. There is some interesting stuff here, including interviews with a doctor at the Medical Bureau set up to investigate reported cures, but the video suffers from uneven pacing and a lack of focus. Despite being filmed on location in Lourdes, long stretches of this video are given to static religious artwork as Bernadette's story is narrated in a pretty flat monotone. This biography of Bernadette leaves out a lot of the major developments while going into unnecessary detail in some aspects regarding the apparitions of Mary in 1858. It also includes theological interpretation and a lot of ""God talk"" overlayed on additional static photography of artwork like a stained glass window of Jesus, which is a bit odd since EWTN apparently filmed the video on location.

For my money, I would have liked to see more on modern-day Lourdes, with a more focused and orderly account of the miraculous cures reported there. While one young woman pilgrim is featured, the video spends a lot of time on a voice-over representing a Frenchman cured in 1987, dubbing an English voice (no indication of whether it's the actual guy's voice or a dramatic recreation) over old photographs of him. But with other miraculous cures, the video simply depicts photos while various doctors or the film's narrator describes them, rather than trying to ""dub"" all of the old photographs.

This artistic inconsistency, coupled with the generally tone-deaf and overly theologized approach to the subject of Bernadette as well as the healings, disappointed me a bit. I bought it as a more recent (it's clearly filmed in the 21st century) alternative to ""Lourdes: Pilgrimage and Healing"" from the early 1990s, but found that the earlier film is much better at giving you pretty much the same thing (minus the extended interviews with a doctor) in 40 minutes. It also preserves the mystery of suffering and healing better than this newer film, which tries too hard to explain everything in terms of God, telling rather than showing you the power of Lourdes. This DVD is not a bad video, by any means, but it's not the clearest or most concise thing I've seen on the topic.",1424217600,2,2380,4.977386934673367
