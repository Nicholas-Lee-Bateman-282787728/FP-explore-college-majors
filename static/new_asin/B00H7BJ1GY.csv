6135613,1,B00H7BJ1GY,The concept sounded cool to be but honestly Jeff Dunham shouldn't of done this movie.  I'm still watching it and im half way through it and the movie hasn't lived up to Jeff Dunham's typical stand up routines.,1395273600,2,209,4.5
6135614,5,B00H7BJ1GY,Just watched the DVD this afternoon.  Hilarious.  Great animation and entertainment.  Hope there are more of these in the future.,1395273600,,129,5.35
6135615,1,B00H7BJ1GY,"Do not buy his movie, it is boring and stupid, can not believe Jeff Dunham allowed this movie to be made,he must need the money I guess.",1395273600,5,136,4.074074074074074
6135616,1,B00H7BJ1GY,"I Love Jeff Dunham, and everything he's done. I could watch all of his movies a hundred times. This, however, is GARBAGE. I don't think I laughed once, and I shut it off 1/2 way through. It's really unfortunate you can't return movies now-a-days because I feel like I just threw money away on this. Save yourself the time and money and just watch some old school Jeff Dunham instead.",1395273600,18,383,4.485714285714286
6135617,5,B00H7BJ1GY,I just bought this DVD at Jeff's live show over the weekend and watched it right when I got home. I'm glad I did because my whole family enjoyed it!

6135619,5,B00H7BJ1GY,"I'm a huge fan of Jeff Dunham, and just got this today!

This was one of the worst attempts of a cartoon crossover or even a cartoon I have ever seen. The plot, the story, and even the animation are sub par. The voice acting is terrible, and the music makes Clerks the animated series sound like it should win an Emmy. I was really disappointed and I hate to say it but I think Jeff was trying just to make some extra cash on this one.",1421107200,,487,4.136842105263158

Jeff branched out into cartooning his talent, and as far as I am concerned into a disaster.  This cartoon is ill conceived and not worth watching at all.  In fact when I was done watching, rather then saving the DVD, I put it in the round file, never to be seen again.  Sorry Mr Dunham for forcing me to write a bad review.

6135732,2,B00H7BJ1GY,"I was happy when I received this DVD, but after watching it, I wasn't all that thrilled with the story line. Between this and the  short-lived TV series, I don't know which I'd prefer. I'll just stick with the concert DVDs; they're more entertaining; at least in my opinion. Sorry, Jeff. I know all the hard work that goes into each show, and you made a great effort in this cartoon, but I didn't care for it. And that's okay. One can't please everyone and one can't like all of it.",1399075200,2,482,4.2967032967032965
6135733,5,B00H7BJ1GY,"Jeff Dunham hit the jackpot when he created Achmed. His signature phrase ""Silent, I kill you!"" never fails to bring a smile. And this movie starring Achmed is fun to watch, has a cute story, cute interesting characters and is very positive in its outlook and ending. I love it when the ""good"" guy (Achmed of course) wins, don't you?!?!",1398988800,,335,4.6
6135734,3,B00H7BJ1GY,"Not particularly funny.  I am a big fan of Jeff Dunham and have seen him in person several times.  He has always put on a great show and will hopefully see him again.  Achmed was ok, but I don't think this was one of his better shows",1398902400,,233,3.9148936170212765

6135737,1,B00H7BJ1GY,We ordered this dvd because we LOVE Jeff Dunham. When we tried to play it the intro played fine. The movie itself refused to start. Not a prob with the remote because it would not start manually either. We called Amazon and as always they were wonderful and sent us a replacement DVD immediately. That one also would not play the movie. We returned it and got our money back. We were very disappointed not to be able to watch the video.,1398643200,,436,4.329268292682927

But the dvd is still funny and great.  Thank you Jeff for some daylight in this area of comedy, that is sometimes a little too dark.  I recommend this cd.",1397952000,,330,4.225806451612903

My husband loves cartoons and was anxious to see it also.  The day the DVD arrived I put it in the player, started it just as he came into the room and the smile he gave when it started was great.  Within 10 minutes he was asleep, I tried very hard to like it, but just couldn't.  We thought it would have Jeff somewhere in it.  I am not a cartoon person so just couldn't get interested in it at all.  Even Achmed (we really like his character in Jeff's shows) couldn't hold our interest.

6135776,5,B00H7BJ1GY,"No bones about it, Jeff Dunham's Achmed Saves America is a tour-de-force in funny!  With a terrific little story as a foil, Achmed takes you on a non-stop adventure in hilarity.  One needs to see this more than once just to get all the great gags in this film since you'll be laughing too hard to catch them all.

This is a story good enough to be enjoyed by the family.  The humor, although adult, has suitable language for children.  YOu quickly care about the lives of the story's supporting characters, all wonderfully voiced over by a terrific team of talent Dunham & Co. have assembled for this charming and even inspirational tale.

At over an hour in length, this animated film this was an impressive project to do. Even still, when it was over you felt like you'd just watched an animated ""short.""  The time just flew by.  The story, fast paced, interesting, and constantly invoking laughter, kept you delightfully mesmerized.  The animation is high quality, especially in the backgrounds, which also in many places easily lend itself to additional laughs.

I cared about all the characters involved, which are skillfully fleshed out (including Achmed, despite being just a bag o' bones) and given depth by the terrific supporting cast.  There are a few plot twists that keep you guessing and some surprising outcomes.

The humor has a wide range, everything from jokes about pop culture, stereotypes, puns, politics, social issues, observation, and more.  These are just a few reflections off the top of my head.  The material is fresh and often innovative.

A real treat.  Indulge yourself.  The only flesh wound you'll come away with after watching this is an aching side from all the laughing.",1395792000,,1706,4.868055555555555
6135777,2,B00H7BJ1GY,I assumed this DVD would feature Jeff Dunham and his Achmed character as featured on all his other dvd's.  Not so.  This is an animated feature (cartoon) of Achmed with a really bad plot.  Whomever suggested to Jeff that Achmed be made into an animated feature should be fired.,1395705600,,277,4.612244897959184

6135781,1,B00H7BJ1GY,"Jeff Dunham is really a comic genius. Over the years I have enjoyed all off Jeff's live shows and his creations. When I pre-ordered this I really didn't catch the fact this was a cartoon but would have ordered it anyway knowing Jeff's reputation for hilarity.

Sadly, this cartoon has really jumped the shark.  Will be donating this to a local sleep lab to help patients falling asleep.

It looks like a metric you can rely upon when a title first comes out is when Amazon shuts out the ability to sell used copies.  They know a bomb will generate lots of used listings/sales before they can sell off their new stock.",1395446400,2,617,4.482142857142857
