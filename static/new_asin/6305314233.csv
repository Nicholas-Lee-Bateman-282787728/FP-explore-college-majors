7887376,4,6305314233,"TWISTS OF TERROR is an import from Montreal TV and its quite good for one of those anthology horror movies.  The first tale, ""The People You Meet"" brings us Jennifer Rubin and Carl Marotte as a couple on their second honeymoon, who are forced off the road by a speeding sportscar.  They get a lift from a doofus who you can tell is not what he seems.  They pick up another hiker (who just happens to be a friend of doofus) and they kidnap Marotte and Rubin and take them to an abandoned cabin.  The twist in this one isn't obvious, but its results are.  Nice little tale.  The second tale, ""The Clinic"" is a little less effective and drawn out.  You can pretty much figure out what's going on once Nick Mancuso goes into this out of the way clinic.  Mancuso does an okay job, but it's too predictable to have a twist.  The final story, ""Stolen Moments"" focuses on the lovely Francoise Robertson who plays a lonely woman who picks up a guy (Andrew Jackson) in a bar and then meets him and his friend for a night of wild love in a house they are ""sitting.""  The twist in this one is pretty shocking and had me fooled.
Well paced for the most part (except the middle story) and the host, Joseph Ziegler, has a nice eerie job as the narrator.",1084752000,2,1238,4.252136752136752
7887377,4,6305314233,"Well, the very first time I saw this I thought it was OK - 2nd was a little bit better.. Well, as described below the theme in these spooky ooky  chillers is that every story has twists in them.. 1st story was pretty  good, some ov the parts were a bit obvious, though... 1st story is just  really based on total hatred between this one couple, and it makes u  somewhat think if  you too are being cheated / hated on, heh..  2nd story -  This one fat guy tries to leave out ov state on business or something, but  he has to put gas.. Anyway, he does, but this one really really mean dog  (is he from hell! ) has other plans for him, after repeatedly biting him  violently, he runs into a rather lonely, obscure hospitol, but are these  doctors really doctors!  Oooo.. 3rd and last story - Quite possibly the  most surprising, I didn't see this one coming at all.. This is basically  about a very lonely / depressed young woman that is in desperate need ov  someone to be with, finally she ends up meeting this one tall guy at a bar,  and BAM! They start seeing each other - But at the end this guy really  screws up bad, and I do mean bad... The main girl on here is a hottie! I  don't wanna ruin anything so... I will stop here, and let u see this for ur  self.. Pros : Nice acting, great atmosphere, pretty-hot girlie in last  story, nice sex! :)Cons : Not the most original movie out there, ok who  cares? Anyway, this flick is well worth ur time!",966643200,4,1450,4.143884892086331
7887378,5,6305314233,"Excellent film. In each story, I had no idea what was going to happen next!  Unique Stories of paranoia, fear and danger, plus sex!  The last story "" Stolen Moments "" makes you wonder..... Highest Ratings  !",957484800,3,207,4.54054054054054
