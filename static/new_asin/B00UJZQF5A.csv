7046654,5,B00UJZQF5A,"Some of our favorite ""mature"" actors do what they do best in this delightful, witty, charming film.  Even younger viewers will love the Bollywood dancing.  Ageing is nothing to fear, because you are only as old as you allow your fears to say that you are.  As wisely stated in the film, how much time do you have?  Somethings are really worth waiting for.  Every hour can bring new things.  There is nothing to be afraid of.",1435968000,2,424,4.441558441558442
7046655,5,B00UJZQF5A,"Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a wonderful film. Starring Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, and an all star cast, it continues the story of British retirees starting new lives in India. Charming is an appropriate word for this treasure of entertainment. I saw this in the theatre. Fans of Maggie Smith, and Judi Dench will like this the most.",1435795200,,340,4.779661016949152
7046656,3,B00UJZQF5A,"this movie came on while I was flying on the airplane. Didnt have any audio though. Thought I was watching a sequel to Slumdog Millionaire where the Indian guy married that girl then helped all these old people open a hotel in his country. Wouldve given it 5 stars but found out it was sequel to different movie, so only 3.",1434931200,2,323,4.311475409836065
7046657,3,B00UJZQF5A,"I really loved Marigold 1 for many reasons: many of my favorite Brit actors, a plausible plot, a good mix of humor and pathos. I saw Marigold 2 in the theater and found it very contrived. The Bollywood dance scene was just nonsense.",1434499200,11,232,4.4186046511627906
7046658,5,B00UJZQF5A,"Awesome movie, do yourself a favor and buy or rent this. Loved every bit of it.",1434067200,2,79,4.0
7046659,5,B00UJZQF5A,"This is better then the first one. It is pure humor supported by excellent actors. As a ow income man over 65, I can see myself living out my days in such a warm and classic setting.",1432166400,31,182,3.945945945945946
7046660,5,B00UJZQF5A,"Some of the best acting the United Kingdom has to offer. The story is fun, like the ""other"" movie; a bit zany in places, a bit romantic in others, and some great scenery. But let's face it, this group of stellar actors and actresses could pull off even a mediocre film; but the writing and presentation of this film is well above the average. Then add the cast and you have a winner worth owning. We will watch our copy over and over and over and over, like the ""other"" one. I had pre-ordered my DVD.

Heartwarming, fun, laughs, emotional, surprising, mostly family friendly, believable characters, and a must-must for anyone age 40 and older. If you are like my wife and me; and you liked The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; then, you are going to like the Second Best Ex-Ma-Hotel; because it is NOT second best, it is just as good.

7046661,4,B00UJZQF5A,"Poor screen writing.  I felt a bond with the struggles of the individuals portrayed in the original movie, but so little in the sequel was of interest.  A sequel held so much potential to explore the richness and experience of individuals as they enter their final years; a time when old gods die, and truths about oneself are discovered.  Such a pity.  It was all wasted in this third rate attempt at a second story line.  No doubt written by individuals who were almost certainly under fifty years of age, and who had no comprehension of the subject matter.",1431302400,8,559,4.606060606060606
7046662,5,B00UJZQF5A,"The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel picks up about 8-9 months after the original story and centers around Sonnys attempts to raise money to buy a second hotel, and the plans for his upcoming marriage to Sunaina.
As with the first story, the acting is superb and the sub plots are excellent, and I am not going to give anything away other than to say there is some farce in here with mistaken identity, misunderstandings and miscommunications subtly played out. The dry wit of the script is fabulous and had the audience roaring with laughter at several points.
This is definitely a wonderful sequel to the original and made me feel optimistic about getting older!",1431129600,180,665,4.791304347826087

7046702,4,B00UJZQF5A,As good as the first.,1516838400,,21,3.4
7046703,5,B00UJZQF5A,"In some ways, better than the first for plot - but truly, the first is so unique!
As the first has several mini stories around the larger one, so too is this one using the same plot device.  Richard Gere is not the big hero, though he struts in and out as one. But he does has a plot line to serve. The original cast is the centerpiece and still the solid part of the movies plot and bringing back an ex with her own story was a clever way to resolve an issue.
Like the first, Dench and Smith characters are played to aplomb by the Dames with Bill Nihy doing a superb job still gaining ground as an independent but sensitive character.
The ending was hard earned and a relief as the plot seemed to be going down a particular path far too long. Great and fun finish.
David Strathairn may be getting credit as the star - hes only in it for the first few minutes - so whoever is listing this movie better actually watch it!",1516492800,,920,4.111111111111111
7046704,5,B00UJZQF5A,"This second installment was funnier and more complicated than The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which I loved also!  The pace moved quickly and the stories wove into interesting tableaus of drama.  The theme was LOVE and there was so much brilliance in the acting, I will just have to watch it again!",1516233600,,298,4.711538461538462

7046717,5,B00UJZQF5A,"Absolutely hilarious movie. However, it also explores the seamy side of life in India and the problems facing retired people living on a fixed income, and is in a way informative as well as entertaining. Judy Dench is great as always. As is often the case, it isn't quite a good as the first movie, but it is very good.",1513036800,,319,4.333333333333333
7046718,2,B00UJZQF5A,"I would love to see this- the first movie was great, but I absolutely refuse to pay nearly double for the Amazon video version.

We find our characters trying to find their place with each other and with India. We have a new guy on the block, Richard Gere, to add to the all star cast as a man who may be of some import. Our retirees help with the wedding and budding commercial success of our proprietor, as he tries to make everyone happy.

However, his character and performance in this movie was so completely annoying.  All of the characters were underdeveloped and there was no cohesiveness to the story.

7046803,5,B00UJZQF5A,"It is rare - too rare - in this day and age to find a movie that features an entire cast of actors who are true masters of their craft.
Instead, we are too often bombarded by films that feature visually stunning special effects that mask mediocre performances and sub-par writing.
That is decidedly not the case in ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" This is a film that features a virtual all-star team of actors, an exotic (and very colorful) locale, and some very fine writing. It is a story about growing old with as much grace as possible while discovering that love is not the strict province of the young.
Because this is a sequel, there are some critics who have said this movie does not live up to the high bar set by ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" I think they are wrong in doing so for this is a separate movie. True, it has virtually the same cast and takes place in the same locale, however, it is its own film with its own objectives. Its purpose is not just to carry the story forward but also to explore new themes.
For example, three of the hotel's residents have rejoined the working world while another couple struggles with the challenge of living in a monogamous relationship when conventional wisdom assumes that they are long past the age at which this question even arises. The residents must also cope with cross-cultural differences, the toll that aging takes on not only the body but also the mind, and the heightened awareness of their own mortality.
The story revolves around two main issues: The impending wedding of hotel owner Sonny (played by Dev Patel) and his fiancee (played by Tina Desai) and his efforts to buy and develop a second residence for older men and women. As part of his efforts to secure a loan for the second property, he must cope with an undercover inspector sent by the corporation that he is asking for financial backing. That leads to some unexpected - and often charming - consequences not only for Sonny but also for the other residents of the hotel and his widowed mother.
Joining the cast for this movie are Richard Gere and Tamsin Grieg. Both blend in beautifully with A-listers Judy Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and the rest of the cast that returned for this sequel. I make a point of that because it's not always easy to do so, especially given the huge success of the first film.
The cinematography is excellent, giving viewers a real sense of what it is like to live and work in modern India and the direction is sure handed. I am a writer by profession and am often overly critical of movie scripts but I must admit I had no issues with this one. The story moves along in a smooth, well-reasoned fashion and the plot - while a little convoluted - is well imagined. The dialogue is often hilarious but throughout the movie the actors are given ample opportunity to express a wide range of emotions.
For my money, this is a 5-star film and one that I will enjoy watching many times over the course of the next few years.",1490832000,6,2996,4.509191176470588

7046934,1,B00UJZQF5A,"The negative reviewers were right. This sequel was a total letdown. When it ended I felt depressed and annoyed. The first movie ended in a high note, this one didn't. Emphasis was on chipping away at the characters instead of building on the marvelous characters they were in the original film.
For example, Douglas was initially a slightly loopy, fun character who became an incompetent, bumbling character, yet Evelyn Greenslade, whose character was developed further, was still in love with him. There was no useful reason for Jean to return at all, she was just yet another unnecessary annoyance.
Norman Cousins and Carol were depicted as lonely, yet nice and appealing-in-their-own-ways people who found joy in each others' company in the original movie. In the second, their characters lost any appeal they had  the first time around. Carol became a silly, selfish older woman sleeping with any man she came across who would have her, because she thought Norman Cousins was cheating on her. Are we living our second set of teenage years, here?
Richard Gere played a role that could have easily been left out, but he's fun to look at so, okay, whatever.
Without discussing each character, the others maintained their initial descriptions pretty well...except a little over the top with Sonny, whom I just love....but maybe just a little overdone this time around?
As I mentioned before, this movie left me feeling down and annoyed because instead of building upon the beautiful characters created in the original movie, some were broken down into senseless and annoying people. There could have been a third sequel that many people would have enjoyed but by downgrading the characters and killing off wonderful Muriel Donnelly, even with a miracle I don't know that I'd even take a chance watching #3.
I have never written a movie review before, but this was so disappointing that I took the time to do it now.",1477440000,2,1915,4.965732087227415

7047063,3,B00UJZQF5A,"The sequel to THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL (2011) contains some familiar cinematic stereotypes about India: the extraordinarily bright light; the teeming streets; the slightly comic citizens who agree with the British yet pursue their own lives; and the colorful dance sequences and wedding ceremony straight out of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008). The star is the same as well: Dev Patel has a leading role in both films.

Yet John Madden's film still retains a certain charm of its own. This is partly due to the sharp script (by Ol Parker) that gives a fair proportion of acerbic one-liners to Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith). Smith has always had a penchant for delivering such material effectively dating right back to her early career at the National Theatre in the mid-Sixties. There are also some delightful cameos from Ronald Pickup as a randy pensioner discovering to his cost that his long-time partner (Diana Hardcastle) is equally as sexually adventurous as himself; and David Strathairn as an American tycoon much taken with Mrs. Donnelly's down-to-earth negotiating style.

The film is multi-plotted, encompassing two will-they-won't-they romances between Sonny (Patel), Sunaina (Tina Desai), and Evelyn (Judi Dench) and Douglas (Bill Nighy). We know perfectly well that both will end happily, but it's rather fun to see how they get there, with Sonny having to overcome his pathological jealousy of Kushal (Shazad Latif), and Douglas dealing with his vindictive wife Jean (Penelope Wilton).

Throughout the action there is always the persistent presence of death; that this group of pensioners having such a wonderful time will soon be broken up. The film has a tragi-comic ending, which perhaps takes longer than it should to unfold (rather too many dance-sequences intercut with long close-ups of one actor), but eventually we understand how and why the hotel has become such a success, giving people the chance to flourish rather than to fester away in some anonymous looking retirement home.",1467849600,,2007,5.285266457680251

If you have seen the first movie, you will laugh at how his character romances the most unlikely character. He does succeed with her, but that is what is funny. She doesn't seem like the romancing type in the first one.
Again, this film was deeply rich in Indian culture and traditions. I was in awe through most of it, especially the wedding ceremony. A breathtaking moment.
The end of the movie had me so choked up though. It was really beautiful. While I know the movie is complete and there was no cliffhanger, I do hope there will be another made. I love visiting the Best Exotic Marigold Hotels, both of them.",1465430400,,757,4.453237410071942

7047186,5,B00UJZQF5A,"I loved this movie, the same way I did the first! The hotel is run by very young Sonny Kapoor and his girlfriend, Sunaina What a funny, rich, interesting and endearing journey story of older Brits thinking they have found, after much research and internet searches, a perfect laid back retirement home for much less than in their country, with a possible exotic lifestyle. But as the saying goes, what appears to be too good usually isn't. And this place, largely, isn't. The building's walls are falling apart, the bedrooms are sparse, there is little running water, no plumbing, electricity and little furniture, and not all rooms are renovated. But the photography, the geography of the area, upclose, is spectacular! But then there is young, vibrant, optimistic Sonny and his girlfriend Sunaina, who is more than willing to help him upgrade his position and career.

In this continuation (don't remember all the characters and detail) as the hotel is being refurbished, it then closes down. Sonny searches for a second companion hotel, and continues to see his girlfriend, Sunaia against his mother's wishes. Muriel, (Maggie Smith) becomes co-manager, with a new medical issue of her own, and spends most of her time at the hotel as Evelyn (Judi Dench) is offered a second job as a fabric buyer,(I think in California) for her higher knowledge of fabric and color, as Douglas (Bill Nighy) who wants to divorce his wife, is concerned about losing her, as they share daily, morning pancake outings, and as he is secretly falling in love and rejected, by Evelyn, who considers them no more than friends, having hoped to introduce his daughter. Meanwhile, Madge (Celia Imrie),divorced and isolating, finally leaves the hotel and soon finds two new suitors, competing with each other, deciding on which one she will choose and this plot ending surprised me. Meanwhile, Carol (Diana Hardcastle) and Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) just meet through Evelyn, and are soon having serious, funny, and misunderstood relationship issues, as he finds her sleeping around. The new guests, for one vacancy, are Guy, Richard Gere, a journalist and writer, who was writing a book  but as he is quickly(who Sonny thinks is the company inspector of the hotel)  taken in by the exotic and the area, lifestyle, and Lillete, Sonny's future mother-in-law, he has started to write chapters about each part of their relationship, and Livinia, who goes to a better hotel.

I felt that the very exciting part of this movie, was the fresh, young optimistic energy of Sonny Kapoor, the so called owner/manager, of this hotel, with his girlfriend/fiance, Sunaina. Soon, Sonny's brothers, who share in the ownership, come up with bright, profit-making ideas on how to find another hotel and want to buy him out. With his struggles and now this, anger ensues. As well, his girlfriend's dancing partner, for a dance show, threatens his relationship and his newly approved impending marriage-chaos ensues. But, in the end with some sorrows, very good surprises, visual excitement abounds, laughter, joy and future possibility. Highly recommend. Both are great movies, for the young and the older.",1457827200,,3165,5.092485549132948

It's a shame, really, for the cast is brilliant, but the story and script of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel hardly allows them to shine.

These people just WALKED through their roles and it's  just a waste of their time, but especially MY TIME!  Do NOT bother w/this film!

Was basically forced to watch this mess while at a friends house, its a late mid life crisis vehicle for aging actors in search of anything else relevent to say. It patronizes the native people of the country they filmed in, pretending a group of twentyish youngsters would give a hoot about these greying americans' problems (because of course americans wouldn't.) Run away from this unless you are 65 and have been married 40 years but just had an affair. Then enjoy but don't pretend your kids care about your drama.

Sonny played by Dev Patel is absolutely charming and I love him to death. Small spoiler someone is checking out his establishment and someone got bad reports from a doctor.

Other than the wonderful cast, the best part of both movies is that they portray seniors as whole adult human beings.  We need so many more movies that respect the adulthood of seniors without the awful stereotypes.",1451692800,13,498,4.428571428571429

7047361,5,B00UJZQF5A,"So often sequels are second best, just cashing in on the success of the first movie, but thankfully that is most definitely not the case with the Second Best Marigold Hotel. The cast list reads like a whos who of British acting talent, the script is clever, light & subtly comedic while the locations make you almost want to go to India.

The plot is fairly straightforward with the regular crowd at the hotel being joined by Tamsin Greig and the annoyingly good looking silver fox Richard Gere. Who is the mystery shopper from the potential investors in the Second hotel in the franchise? That is the nub of the plot but it hardly really matters; the plot is just the vehicle for the stupendous cast and the sparkling writing. There are smiles, laughs and tears aplenty as the core narrative is gently but insistently pressed home; make the most of everything life has to offer.

Maggie Smith has some superbly memorable and insightful one liners (in reply to Judi Denchs I just need more time, she responds How much time do you have? and There's no such thing as an ending; just a place where you leave the story. The whole script is peppered with such lovely pearls of wisdom (I came to pay my respects. There's nothing I respect more than someone planting trees under whose shade they may never sit.  sorry, I couldn't resist including another).

It is so easy to focus the performance of the pantheon of British acting talent that it is equally easy to forget to mention the superb Indian cast. Sonnys endless optimism & enthusiasm and Babuls delightful mixed metaphors are always a pleasure.

This is a delightful film; funny, light, heart warming, life affirming yet sad and poignant in equal measure. Prepare for a good laugh but keep the tissues handy.",1451088000,2,1761,4.686084142394822

7047374,3,B00UJZQF5A,"I would certainly agree that this movie is the ""Second Best"" movie...as it doesn't hold a candle to the first one.  It continues with the same brilliant cast which includes Maggie Smith and Judy Dench (two of my favorites), Bill Nighe, and other actors you will easily recognize from watching British tv shows and movies.  The setting in India is still beautiful and definitely exotic, but it seemed like the story wandered a lot and I found my attention wandering a lot.  Not even the promised wedding of Sonny and Sunaina, including a homage of dance and music a la Bollywood, could renew my interest in the movie.

The story includes the interweaving of the lives of the characters from the first movie, with the addition of Richard Gere as Guy, a man staying at the hotel who Sonny suspects is the secret reviewer of his plan to buy another hotel and expand.  Guy also takes a shine to Sonny's mother, Mama G.  Evelyn has to decide if her hobby of buying fabric/scarves should be a new career move.  Muriel faces some difficulties of her own.  But the focus is generally on the issues between Sonny and his fianc and his jealousy of another man that makes him doubt himself and, clearly, is putting wedding plans in jeopardy.

7047378,4,B00UJZQF5A,"I found this to be at least equal to the first film and perhaps even better.  The writing is tighter.  The performances are all strong and the film ends with an excellent Bollywood dance number.

It is interesting that the Amazon site lists David Strathairn first among the actors.  I love DS but he appears in only two brief (but pivotal) scenes.  On the other hand, Richard Gere joins the cast for this sequel and adds a great deal.

The 66 year-old Bill Nighy courting the 81 year-old Judi Dench is completely plausible and Maggie Smiths talents are everywhere in evidence.  Dev Patel is a little overactive and wired for my taste, but that is his role.  You see his self-confidence and sure hand in the closing dance sequence.

All in all this is a pleasant evenings entertainment.  Whenever you assemble an array of top British actors good things are likely to happen.

There's lot of reviews on what the movies are about, but the twists of plot and depth of character are both a little more intricate in the second movie than in the first.

The street scenes are dazzling and the finale really pulls out all the stops.

7047478,4,B00UJZQF5A,"The title refers to Sonny Kapoors dream of opening a second hotel.  But to take the title a different way, its the second best exotic Marigold Hotel movie, not the best.  I completely loved the first movie.  This one is good, but does not capture the magic of the first.  It certainly has charm -- and I will irritate some people by saying I loved the Bollywood musical finale -- but little magic.

It was wonderful to see the cast back (even Penelope Wilson returns as Jean Ainslie, who had returned to England) and still living their lives to the fullest -- seniors as people, not props.  And, of course, there are problems and jealousies that need to be resolved.  Do they get resolved?  Remember, these are feel-good movies, so that should give you a clue.

My main quibble is the  to me, at least  fake and forced romance involving Richard Gere.  I did not buy it at all.  Still, its a small part of the movie.

As for the musical number, it is planned from the start.  The characters talk about choreography and rehearsing for the big wedding dance.  We know its coming, so why does it bother people that it is there?  I don't get it.  I think people compare it to Slumdog Millionaire because that is the only Bollywood movie they have ever seen (and it is a great movie) and the marvelous Dev Patel is in both.

If you loved the first Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, I highly recommend watching this one.  Do not approach it with the expectation that it is as good as the first, but simply an enjoyable and entertaining story that brings back old friends.  I really wanted to see more of them, Im glad I did, and I hope Sonny will open a Third Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.",1447977600,,1674,4.387622149837133

7047711,3,B00UJZQF5A,I was expecting to be really entertained.  I really like Richard Gere.  I found the movie to be disjointed and hard to understand.  I was also disappointed in that Richard Gere had a very small part in the movie.  On the other hand my wife said she enjoyed the movie.  After the movie was over I think I figured out the problem.  I believe it is VERY IMPORTANT to see the first movie before watching the second.  I probably would have done that if I even knew there was a first movie.  I found out afterwards from my wife.  I strongly recommend watching The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel before watching The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  If not you may be in for a very big let down.  I could go back and watch them in reverse order but I'm afraid it would be very anti-climatic.  Bottom line - I'm not sure if it's good or not.  That's why I rated it Okay.,1444694400,2,860,4.2024539877300615

7047714,2,B00UJZQF5A,Absolutely disappointing. Hollywood meets Bollywood. Every clich and patronizing humor was there. I wonder why so many good actors wanted to participate after they read the script?,1444694400,,180,5.703703703703703
7047715,5,B00UJZQF5A,"Even though I thought the plot was a little week, I enjoyed so much the wonderful cast of talented actors.  Judy Dench and Maggie Smith are, as usual, at their best.  Such good actresses.",1444694400,,187,4.470588235294118

7047721,5,B00UJZQF5A,I am a big fan of Richard Gere's work (and his classic handsome look) and Judy Dench always makes whatever part she plays an extension of her creative abilities but I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie nearly as much as I did.  The setting was fabulous.  All of the stars were perfectly cast.  The mixture of individual stories were interesting and entertaining.  Didn't think I'd like it but I love it!,1444521600,,405,4.583333333333333
7047722,5,B00UJZQF5A,"A delightful follow-up to the original movie. In this one, the characters are now well-established so there's no real introduction to each. An all-star cast and all are outstanding. This story follows Sonny's attempts to buy a second hotel, interspersed with plans for his upcoming marriage and his jealousy of a childhood friend who now seems to have become a rival in love and business, at least in his mind. There's a second romance when an American guest falls in love with Sonny's mother and humorous moments with other cast members because of amorous misunderstandings. A Hollywood dance number ends the movie which continues to espouse the theme of the first...that you're never too old to pursue your dreams or find a new love.",1444521600,,735,4.935483870967742

7047724,4,B00UJZQF5A,"It was definitely worth watching, and it was the reviews for this movie that made me want to go watch the first one first, which IMHO is a definite must.  The story will make more sense and give you much more closure if you understand the character progression from the first movie.  This movie isn't just an attempt to recreate the same experience as the second for some quick cash.  It really is Part 2 of the story, and I think that also might be what ended up making it not quite as good.

In this Part 2, the story lines and characters into which we have invested are all entering into the more serious aspects of their storylines which results in them not having as much quirky levity that we saw in the first movie.  I don't think this earns the movie a big detractor, but I think infusing it with such could have avoided or lightened just a bit of the drama that took over much of the experience.

Overall, I did enjoy watching the movie with my mother, and the movie just still, at it's core, embody the quirky and fun dialogue exchanges between the characters that made the first movie such a delight.  Its definitely worth the watch and it was a good movie, but I had to give it 4 stars because the first movie was a 5 star and this one leaves just a little to be desired but was definitely not disappointing.",1444435200,,1320,4.27710843373494
7047725,4,B00UJZQF5A,"I really liked the movie but I was VERY disappointed in the quality of the copy I received.  Previously copies I got from Amazon were good quality.  However, this one wasn't - it was similar quality to that I can get for 1/2 the price at the Dollar Store (also VERY disappointing).  I have not watched the other two movies I ordered at the same time because I am a bit afraid I might have the same experience.",1444435200,,409,4.217948717948718
7047726,5,B00UJZQF5A,One of the rare movies where the sequel can live up to the expectations raised by the first part. We watched the first movie and could not wait to watch the sequel once it was out on Amazon. We were not disappointed at all.,1444435200,,223,4.090909090909091

Two older women in the movie are screwing more than one guy.  One person is on the verge of dementia and trying to get together with a woman who has a lot more on the ball, and so the story goes.
This movie is an affront to mature individuals such as myself.  There is more to life after 60 than the shallowness portrayed in this movie.

There was one 'Bollywood' style song and dance scene and that was as nearly about as Indian as it got.

7047956,2,B00UJZQF5A,"1.5 stars. Pretty close to a complete disaster, despite the excellent cast. Nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel does. It has practically no plot or story, just a bunch of little set-pieces in which the various members of the all-star cast do star turns, and, in the case of a few of them, outrageous mugging. Its narrative pulse is nearly catatonic. It's flat and glossy as a postcard. It's superficial, maudlin, smarmy, and weirdly oversexed. Whereas the original made some hay in contrasting Brit stereotypes to real India, this one is set in a fantasy travelogue India that must be accessible only to Eurotrash zillionaires. Absolutely nothing about it rings true or authentic in any way. It feels like a mess of inferior outtakes cut from the original were thrown together to cash in on the original's appeal -- reminiscent of Ocean's 12 in that way. Awful. I'm giving it a half-star above hated-it for its nice soundtrack and a few charming Bollywood moments.",1442880000,,978,4.862275449101796

7047997,3,B00UJZQF5A,"The further escapades of the British elders features essentially the same cast as the 2011 ""Best Exotic..."" with some added attractions.  The hotel's owner and manager, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel, digging deep to add more Indian to his English) has come to the conclusion that since the original hotel is fully booked with residents, he should add another.  In order to do this he needs a financial backer.  So he and his co-manager, Muriel Donnelly (as always, great, Maggie Smith) head for California to meet with an investment company headed by Ty Burley (David Strathhairn).

Sonny seems to take an indirect route from India, cavorting Ms. Donnelly in a Mustang convertible on Route 66 somewhere in the American Southwest.  While no commitment is certain, Burley says he will send his ""guy"" to take a look at the property.  Back in India, the usual gang seem to be busy at retirement, other than taking the easy road.  The recently separated Douglas (Bill Nighy) is trying to romance the widowed Evelyn (Judi Dench), but she seems standoffish in spite of their obvious attraction.  Douglas also works as a guide.  Evelyn is offered a job as a buyer for a fabric maker.  Norman (Ronald Pickup) is shacking up with Carol (Diana Hardcastle) but has a wondering eye for the ladies.  Madge (Celia Imrie) is doubling up, spending many a night with 2 different wealthy Indians, unable to make up her mind who she likes best.
So much romance in the air for the greatest generation, so you would think there would be some showing of physical affection somewhere in the film.  Isn't director John Madden trying to show these aging characters as vibrant sexual beings?

A newcomer shows up at the hotel in the form of Richard Gere who plays a ""young"" American keen on writing his first novel.  But Sonny has him pegged as the inspector sent to evaluate the hotels for Burley.  Guy Chambers (Gere) is smitten with Sonny's mother (Lillette Dubey) who doesn't seem all that interested.  Recognizing that Guy's approval of the venture is paramount, Sonny does all he can to pimp out his mother.

Unfortunately, even with stalwart actors like these, the movie is much more confusing that it should be and in some cases, down right ridiculous.  Patel's Sonny, in particular, is just annoying.  His overbearing concern for getting Chambers approval almost tanks his impending wedding.  You would think perhaps putting it on hold for a short time.  Thankfully he didn't and the wedding in the final act saves the film from just being another romantic comedy for oldsters.

Fox Video does a nice job transferring the film to Blu ray.  It is seen in a 1080p resolution and has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  This part of India is evidently flush with beautiful people, beautiful scenery and bold colors all evident with the wonderful cinematography.  Everything is clear, sharp and exceptionally detailed.  All the better to see the wrinkled maturity of the actors.  Audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix which does a great job of surrounding the viewer with ambient sounds of the bustling city as well as a vibrant score and soundtrack.  Dialog is clear and properly focused.  Well done.  There are numerous subtitle options too numerous to list here.  Suffice it to say, if you speak Romanian, you're covered.  Extras include a half dozen very brief snippets with interviews, location information and the like.  There's also a photo gallery and a couple trailers.",1442361600,,3447,4.877796901893287

The plot was a jumbled mess and why Richard Gere was cast in this movie is a mystery to me. I can see his name was the attraction for his fans, but anyone could have played his character...and probably played it better. The original cast, while normally excellent actors, were wasted because of the silly story-line and only marginally humorous dialog.

I would have done it differently but certainly I still recommend it to one and all. It's very unique, very well done, and the actors do a wonderful job.

I also enjoyed getting it on Amazon. I do rent from RedBox and of course I subscribe to Netflix. The problem with both of them is, on RedBox I don't want to always rush back the next day to avoid getting charged again, and Netflix doesn't have the newest films. The advantage of Amazon Instant Video is that you get it for at least 24 hours, sometimes longer, it's a brand new film, you can play it on your Smart TV, and you never have to leave the house.

7048147,3,B00UJZQF5A,"The first Exotic Marigold hotel movie was one that really surprised me with its unique and funny story.  It was one that I really enjoyed more than I expected when I started watching.  So the sequel was something I expected a bit more out of, even though I wasn't really sure what they could do with a second story.  The movie and story itself isn't a bad one but the sequel fails to recapture the magic and freshness that made the first movie so uniquely good.  It is with sequels like it is with music from a band that comes out with an album that has 5 top 20 hits and goes multi-platinum and then they release the next one that has only one song that hits the top 20.  This movie like that bands follow up isn't a bad one; it just doesnt make it to the heights of the first and seems a bit ordinary.  This like the first one has a fine cast and they play their roles well but the story has a bit too many things going on and seems to lack a bit of focus.  It seems almost like the creators were surprised by the success of the first and decided to quickly put together a sequel.  Sometimes a sequel (especially a quick one) is not needed, especially when you it lacks a cohesive plot and link to the first.

Now that The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is full up with its long-term residents, co-managers Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) and Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) have a dream of expansion, and they've found just the place: The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. With plans underway, Evelyn and Douglas (Judi Dench and Bill Nighy) venture into the Jaipur workforce, wondering where their regular breakfast dates will lead. Meanwhile, Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle) navigate the swirling waters of an exclusive relationship, as Madge (Celia Imrie) juggles two very eligible suitors, and recent arrival Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) finds a muse in Sonny's mother, Mrs. Kapoor (Lillete Dubey) for his next novel.

The first movie told the story of several British people who had decided to move to India in retirement, largely because they could not afford to live comfortably in their own country.

The title of this movie is ""Second Best.."", and that is accurate- it certainly is not as good as the original. Nonetheless, it is an appealing movie, which tries hard - and largely succeeds- in delivering pleasant light entertainment.

The story picks up several months after the first movie ended, and it continues with relating the lives of the original movie's characters.

The sequel has a greater focus on light comedy, and the extraction of humour from the characters' situations. Overlaid on that are several romances.

The cast of experienced actors appear to be having an enjoyable time with the light comedy, sometimes farcical situati... Read more",1441324800,,1010,5.140243902439025

But the addition of Richard Gere to this cast line up... all I can say is ""meh"" for his performance, but he at least created a new story line to have these actors follow.  His character just not as believable, or sincere, but the movie concept is still good.  I think this would make a good series instead.  Keep rotating the basic core characters, but bring in and out guest appearances who have different adventures while at the hotel.  Make it about AGING GRACEFULLY!",1440892800,,578,4.466666666666667

I am glad I viewed it as it was a fun ride. The colorful setting and the likable -- or at least interesting -- characters were enjoyable. And with players like Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup and David Strathairn even platitudes are enjoyable.
If you want to see these outstanding performers in their richest performances, this is not the film you want. I do not give it 5 stars because it is a ground-breaking cinema; I give it 5 stars because it is a warm, comfortable visit with a talented cast in a light comedy directed at an audience who themselves are facing the challenges and uncertainties of aging.",1440633600,,847,4.542483660130719

This one bears no resemblance to the first.  Far too much time on the Bollywood dance routines - to the point I fast forwarded in an attempt to see if there were any meaningful dialogue or character development.  There wasn't.

7048634,2,B00UJZQF5A,"Not as good as the first, which was good.  The second time around, the main character and his self-induced problems are annoying throughout the film, the pointless rivalry with his friend over his fianc and the other hotel is tedious, and his behavior concerning his mother's relationship with the Richard Gere character is imbecilic.  The old men on the make are predictable and pathetic.  The perpetually sour deserting wife returns to make us feel pity for her and wish she had stayed away.  I am not sure what ages the characters were supposed to be portraying, but the old men and women seem more physically fit and active than real folks would be, considering they had all come to the hotel, as the young proprietor repeats throughout the film, expecting to expire there.  None of them seems to have problems with mental abilities or declining health (until dramatically suddenly convenient at the very end for one character).  I suspect the Richard Gere character might have been added simply because he was in the neighborhood on his way to Tibet.  Why not watch a movie by a good Indian director?",1439769600,,1105,4.814814814814815

TSecondBEMH may have been very good too, but the music/background audio was sooo loud drowning out the dialog that I could not hear 25% of the dialog...very annoying.  Movies that don't have explosions, car chases, special effects etc, rely on smart, witty dialog, and when the dialog can't be heard, reviews go from 5 stars to 3 maybe 2 stars.
Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, and Richard Gere deserved a better tech crew.",1439769600,,506,4.674157303370786

I often cringe when I see a movie I enjoyed has produced a sequel, they often just don't live up to the original for me....this one I found in many ways did.  I love how involved you get with each of these characters.  Maggie Smith is once again the old, crochety, keep people at arm's length, battle-axe....with a heart; you really come to see a character with a good heart in this movie with her.  I think that basically says it all for me about this movie with all of the characters...each character has depth, each character makes you feel something just as they did in the first movie.

7048642,4,B00UJZQF5A,"If you liked the first Exotic Marigold Hotel film, you're going to like this one as well.  It has almost all the important actors and actresses of the first film [which went a long way toward making it as good as it was], plus some new ones, including Richard Gere.  They took all of the incipient relationships of the first film, ran down the field with them, and added several new ones as well.  Also some of the best Indian scenery is again on display.  As for the title, its sort of a play on words, as it is of course a sequel, and then a prominent part of the plot involves the owner of the first hotel trying to buy a second one to expand his business.  It seemed a good cross between more conventional Indian films and the usual Hollywood sort of movies [except most of the actors are British, aren't they?].  Im a little surprised they were able to maintain a PG rating.  There are certainly allusions to sexual activity, though not depictions, and there are occasional suitably-muffled swearwords.  But generally this is a mixture of good fun and philosophical observations about life.  I did like it...probably second-best.",1439683200,3,1134,4.601990049751244

Too many emotions especially the character that was frisky with gentlemen, The beginning has two characters travel off to Los Angeles to get a person to give them money to expand and then that person gets some of the last 15 seconds of the movie, no more of telling you.

And at times he comes across as a class A jerk, which strikes me as being way out of character.  Some of the other stories are a bit far-fetched, especially that of Mrs. Hardcastle and to a less extent that of Carol and Norman.  I almost always enjoy Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, and this time was no exception.

7048668,4,B00UJZQF5A,"The original concept struggles too hard in this film and finally expires.  The big to do about wedding dances is about as riveting a cold oatmeal and the story line, while being stock and predictable, is rather like a bug on a windshield, mashed all over and unrecognizable.  The film labors at getting some major story line that is coherent together and instead ends up with so many little situations going at once they all feel manufactured, silly and don't have a lot of relevance to anything.  An example of this is the scene where Maggie Smith loads a young woman up with cookies she brought from America.  What in the world is this all about?  Oh wait in the first movie....etc. The cast does the best they can with the mishmash but even great talent and acting skill, which the majority of the cast have, didn't really pull it off.  However all the weak story and silly situations can not take away from the location.  This movie is weaker than the first one in the treatment of the country but it is still a good look at India.  Good popcorn movie with the young grandchildren and a springboard for discussion of foreign cultures.  Not nearly as riveting as a book.",1439683200,,1173,4.521327014218009

to know the characters more deeply but maintains the same light-hearted spirit. These are

Singlehandedly Maggie Smith can upstage him with one sentence.  Add to that Bill Nighy and Judy Dench, and you've got a serious imbalance.

Sonny (Dev Patel) and Muriel (Maggie Smith) are traveling on Route 66 to San Diego, California. There they have a meeting with Ty Burley (David Strathairn) of the Evergreen Company. They come back to India with new ideas.

See how the residents we have come to know are doing now and the new guests that arrive, Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig) and Guy Chambers (Richard Gere).

 I am so glad everyone returned for this second movie. I hope they make a third movie.

The story continued where it left off from the first one.  Now Sonny wants to expand his hotel empire.  He's planning to buy a new hotel at the same time he is planning his wedding.  I followed that much, but not much else.  Who was in love with whom?  Who was sleeping with whom and WHY?  What shouldve been a touching scene came out as pitiful.

Im giving it two stars because #1) the actors are great, and #2) LOVED the Indian wedding dance!  I wished the people involved in the making of this movie had come up with a better storyline and script.  As it is, its a snoozer.",1439164800,,819,4.233766233766234

Weaknesses are that it burns too many minutes showing us the insecurities of Dev Patel's character, and it sets up some new relationships that it only half explores. It leaves you wondering whether ""that's all there is going to be to them"" or ""are they pausing these relationships at this point in order to explore them in a third installment""?

Maggie Smith's character told her poignant story of being a suddenly displaced nanny and bookkeeper in the first film, only to say she'd spent 40 years scrubbing floors in the second movie. The couple who parted on reasonably good terms at the end of the first movie suddenly had been at each other's throats for years. And the wife had gone from being hard to like to downright repulsive (but played wonderfully by Penelope Wilton).

This film lacked the tenderhearted feeling and intelligent story progression of the first Marigold. There was too much manic buzzing around concerning the wedding storyline that bored me, like an overdrawn Three Stooges skit.

This one was a charmer.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  All the characters I fell in love with in the original are back, and a few new ones.  Each one, well into their senior years in the first movie, still are able to grow and change.  This movie has all the heart in the world, moments of laughter, moments of deep emotion.

7049029,4,B00UJZQF5A,"This movie is starting to morph itself into a soap opera rather than a movie. Coupled with the first movie, this film leaves one wanting to know more about the characters and what will be their next adventure or who is going to die next? It is entertaining without the hype that some movies today possess.
I recommend it. One does not have to have seen the first to make sense of the second- but seeing both will make one wish for a third.",1438819200,,439,4.238095238095238

It was a cute addition, but while I enjoyed the first one enough to have purchased and watched it numerous times, I don't feel the need to purchase its successor.

But the ""feel good"" is so much more in the first movie. I felt that Richard Gere's character was somewhat formulaic and it was a predictable story line, as was the ending of the film. Maggie Smith was still the most outstanding character, as in the first movie. She was a beneficent mother-figure but still maintained that sharp edge that we saw glimpses of once in a while. All in all, a nice movie to spend two hours watching. It just didn't live up to the first film.",1438646400,,615,4.310344827586207

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Dame Maggie Smith, Dame Judi Dench, Bill Nighy and most of the remaining cast of 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' are reunited for this follow-up film also featuring Richard Gere. As the sequel to a film that hinted at a follow-up in the first outing's final scenes, John Madden's The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel [2015] offers just as much joy, heart and chuckles as its hugely successful predecessor. With director John Madden once again at the helm, the core cast is back to once again wend their way through a bustling Jaipur, dealing with new careers, young love and fresh beginnings in their twilight years. The audience is dragged into a world even more technicoloured than before; one brimming with light and music, designed to evoke the eternal charm of India more prominently than ever.

Set against the impending nuptials of lovebirds Sonny Kapoor [Dev Patel] and Sunaina [Tina Desai], the septuagenarian quintet, find themselves eight months into their new life in Jaipur and keeping on its sunny side. Muriel Donnelly [Dame Maggie Smith] is helping Sonny Kapoor run the hotel; Evelyn Greenslade [Dame Judi Dench] works for a textile import company; Douglas Ainslie [Bill Nighy] plays roustabout tour guide, patiently waiting for Evelyn to return his romantic advances. Madge Hardcastle [Celia Imrie] and Norman [Ronald Pickup] run the affairs of The Viceroy Club, still playing fast and loose in matters of the heart. Yet again, they all face the tribulations and pleasures of their newly carved niches. In this second go-round, there is stability for all involved; it's maintaining it that proves tricky.

In the midst of the fireworks, an enigmatic American arrives at the Marigold Hotel in the form of Richard Gere [Guy Chambers] arrival sends Madge Hardcastle [Celia Imrie] into a swoon, by saying, ""Lordy lord, have mercy on my ovaries!"" But at the same time brings out the slight clumsiness of the situation as he immediately gets attracted to Mrs. Kapoor [Lillete Dubey], but she is also a mother and going for a relationship is not meant for her in the Indian society. Their values are different, and they keep clashing. However, these things don't happen to generate any sense of pity, but they dig out the basics of human nature. In another scene, a character Madge Hardcastle talks to her unmarried, 40-something driver and goes to visit his home. She has not decided on her best suitor yet and that keeps her mind occupied with negative thoughts, but then she gets into a conversation with her poor driver, who can't quite speak in fluent English, but is very charming in the process and his is the most charming scene in the entire film, where the conversation goes as follows: Madge: Why didn't you marry? Driver: Never fell in love. Madge: Didn't stop me though. Another poignant part in the film is when Dame Judi Dench says, it was meant to be about the end, but now it's about the beginning, you immediately get the resolution.

The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel succeeds in its moments of comedy: Dev Patel once again rouses with his performance as the eternally optimistic and determined young entrepreneur. Dame Maggie Smith, while giving her best iteration of English-bred directness, is given some of the best one-liners to date. John Madden expands the world of the hotel further outside its walls to give more of a travelogue vibrancy to the staging; this new iteration of the city pulses and shimmers under the glimmer of the Indian sun.

Ol Parker's screenplay has quite a lot to juggle when you think about it: Not only does it have to integrate the wedding into the plot; it also has to perform this movie's version of fan service: Give each member of its cast of heavyweights something meaty to do. These are, after all, some of the finest actors in the known universe, and you cant just have them stand around. It also has to handle the introduction of a new character: a somewhat enigmatic author played by Richard Gere, who Sonny is convinced is a hotel inspector despite all appearances to the contrary (a subplot that recalls the classic Fawlty Towers episode). It could have easily become a total disaster, but with the help of the occasional subplots and wacky-old-person shenanigans, the proceedings remain dignified and smooth, thanks to the game cast, some decent romantic tension, particularly between Bill Nighy and Dame Judi Dench, as well as Richard Gere and Lillete Dubey, as Sonnys mother, and John Maddens elegant, patient camera. The title says it all, especially by calling it The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, it could of course come second best, but for those who adored the original, and you will love and embrace this wonderful magical film, with heaps of wonderful colourful characters.

But the film is, at its core, is a meditation on the sacred final years of one's life. The foolish belief is that just because someone is of a certain age and again supposedly signals the end of pleasures like love, friendship and careers is continually disproved within the boundaries of each character's respective storyline. This renewal of life is saccharinely optimistic but, then again, this is the just the sort of film that should be allowed to revel in that. Time feels more precious now and each character is allowed more space to explore and grow out of the pasts that have shaped them, letting them come to empowerment for the future. This film is shamelessly, unapologetically sentimental, but thats just fine because were rooting for everyone here. The multiple storylines spin off the whirlwind that is Sonny who juggles both his upcoming wedding to Sunaina [Tina Desai] and his ambitious plans to open a second hotel for which he requires the blessing of an American finance company. His expansion plans provide a clever raison dtre for the sequel and add a bit of mystery and surprise to a plot that opts for gentle laughs and tender moments over heavy dramatics or heartache. The relationships don't all ring true and accommodating so many storylines rather bloats the running time but its heart-warming and hilarious, directed with a fine eye for local colour by John Madden. Above all, its another terrific showcase for the distinguished cast. But the absolute star of this show, the reason anybody might enjoy it, is because Dame Maggie Smith is Dev Patels assistant and a very wise counsellor, because Muriel Donnellys sour deflations of all this afflatus being what makes the entire package tolerable.

John Madden directs this sequel The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel by paying close attention to the fragmented nature of the story which involves so many different characters. In total, they offer a kaleidoscopic view of the many forms of love as this improvised family comes together to support Sonny Kapoor and each other. The drama concludes with a festive Indian wedding with lively music,  dance, and song. Dame Maggie Smith's touching coda in a letter from Muriel underlines the themes of the film and proves to be good medicine for the soul. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel delivers the same winning formula of laughter and tears, eliciting strong performances from Dame Judi Dench, Bill Nighy and Dame Maggie Smith at her acid-tongued, indomitable best. The course of true love, even in twilight years, never runs smooth and Parker composes variations on a theme of amour, while peppering his script with pithy one-liners. ""There is no present like the time,"" professes one wise soul. John Madden's film is certainly a gift: you get everything you expect, plus enjoyable enthusiastic moments, but one sad moment at the end of the film, what that is, you will have to view this brilliant film to find out. This film gets the gold standard in my opinion and all those critics out there, who have given it sarcastic reviews, on the negative side, should be totally ashamed of themselves, in writing such misogynous dinosaur critical drivel.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film has an extremely stunning 2.39:1 theatrical aspect ratio that is faithfully reproduced in this awesome 1080p encoded image. Sharpness is superb throughout the presentation, and colour is vibrant and supremely full-bodied without ever blooming. Flesh tones are deeply saturated throughout. Contrast has been applied spectacularly well to give the picture a consistent sheen while black levels are rich and deep.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound mix offers a lively audio presentation with the dialogue beautifully recorded and placed in the centre channel. Thomas Newmans background score gets an immersive presentation through the fronts and rears and really delivers the goods during the two dance sequences, especially at the engagement and wedding parties. Likewise, sound effects are effectively split when necessary and pan through the soundstage occasionally to great effect.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Promotional Features: With this particular feature, is that you get is six brief vignettes feature film clips and sound bites from the cast and crew about the making of the film and they are as follows:

1. STORY [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1 / 16:9] [03:06] This first promotional feature starts at beginning of the film with Dame Maggie Smith doing her bit to promote the Marigold Hotel for the investors. But them we go to John Madden [Director] giving us the lowdown on the story of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. We get even more clips from the 2015 film, but with nice little interviews slotted in with the main actors Dev Patel [Sonny Kapoor]; Dame Maggie Smith [Muriel Donnelly]; Dame Judi Dench [Evelyn Greenslade]; Tina Desai [Sunaina]; Richard Gere [Guy Chambers] and Bill Nighy [Douglas Ainslie], despite them calling these features Promotional, they are really more like a long advert for the film, but despite this, they are all very nice little features.

2. CAST [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1 / 16:9] [03:38] next up we get more clips from the 2015 film, plus some behind-the-scenes from the film, as well as more contributions from people like Graham Broadbent [Producer]; John Madden [Director]; Diana Hardcastle [Carol Parr]; Dev Patel [Sonny Kapoor]; Dame Maggie Smith [Muriel Donnelly]; Celia Imrie [Madge Hardcastle]; Penelope Wilton [Jean Ainslie]; Dame Judi Dench [Evelyn Greenslade]; Tamsin Greig [Lavinia Beech] and Richard Gere [Guy Chambers]. Although, again this is a another small Promotional film, at least you get to get some intimate view from the main actors heaping great praise on everyone involved with the 2015 film.

3. RETURNING TO THE MARIGOLD HOTEL [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1 / 16:9] [02:52] Once again we get short excerpts from the 2015 film, plus also again behind-the-scenes of shooting the film. But we also get more short little interviews and comments from the likes of Dame Judi Dench [Evelyn Greenslade]; Dame Maggie Smith [Muriel Donnelly]; Dev Patel [Sonny Kapoor]; Celia Imrie [Madge Hardcastle]; John Madden [Director]; Bill Nighy [Douglas Ainslie]; Ronald Pickup [Norman Cousins]; Richard Gere [Guy Chambers]; Graham Broadbent [Producer]; and Ol Parker [Writer]. But what is nice about this little feature, is that everyone was so pleased to be back in India, also praising the brilliant script by Ol Parker, plus the wonderful colourful India and all the wonderful people of that country.

4. BLOSSOMING RELATIONSHIPS [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1 / 16:9] [02:45] With this particular short promotional film, we again get short excerpts from the film, but this time the contributors talk intimately about the romance that happens throughout the 2015 film, and the views we hear are from the following contributors, like Dame Maggie Smith [Muriel Donnelly]; John Madden [Director]; Dame Judi Dench [Evelyn Greenslade]; Ol Parker [Writer]; Bill Nighy [Douglas Ainslie]; Richard Gere [Guy Chambers]; Lillete Dubey [Mrs. Kapoor]; Celia Imrie [Madge Hardcastle]; Ronald Pickup [Norman Cousins] and Dev Patel [Sonny Kapoor]. What is really nice about this short little film is that they talk about all of the ups and downs with the rollercoaster emotions of the film and about the blossoming romance of the older generation in the film and they all say that they are disappointed that they don't make these sorts of films anymore.

5. THE MARIGOLD WEDDING [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1 / 16:9] [02:35] Once again we get plenty of clips from the 2015 film, plus again more behind-the-scenes of the makeup sessions. But we also get the inner thoughts from the people involved with the film, especially leading up to the final climax of the film with the spectacular wedding ceremony and again we get contributions from the following: Dame Judi Dench [Evelyn Greenslade]; John Madden [Director]; Dev Patel [Sonny Kapoor]; Tina Desai [Sunaina]; Daniel Phillips [Hair and Makeup Designer]; Martin Childs [Production Designer]; Louise Stjernsward [Costume Designer]; Longinus Fernades [Choreographer]; Graham Broadbent [Producer]; Ol Parker [Writer]; Richard Gere [Guy Chambers] and Tamsin Greig [Lavinia Beech]. Again, what a joyous little film this is, especially hearing all about the wonderful time everyone had on making this fabulous and fantastic 2015 film, especially witnessing the process that went into filming the explosive and spectacular wedding sequence at the end of the equally spectacular and wonderful film.

6. FILMING IN INDIA [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1 / 16:9] [02:34] here we have the last of the special Promotional films and here we get to see the cast and crew talk about their experiences of filming in India for the 2015 film and telling us also their personal experiences and those particular contributors were John Madden [Director]; Dame Judi Dench [Evelyn Greenslade]; Richard Gere [Guy Chambers]; Richard Gere [Guy Chambers]; Tamsin Greig [Lavinia Beech]; Celia Imrie [Madge Hardcastle]; Ol Parker [Writer]; Graham Broadbent [Producer] and Bill Nighy [Douglas Ainslie]. But what came out of their experiences in India, is how the people of that country welcomed them back and was so pleased to see all the actors again, also the original actors had their own rooms back again at the Marigold Hotel, and again telling us that their whole wonderful experience in The Second best Exotic Marigold Hotel was the most joyous time of their lives.

Special Feature: GALLERY [2015] [1080p] You get to see a selection of 26 wonderful images from the 2015 film, which is composed of still intimate images of the main actors of the film, plus images from the different parts of the film. You can select two options, one is the Manual Advance, but I preferred the Auto Advance, because you get to launch the slideshow, where the images change every five seconds. Happy viewing!

Theatrical Trailers: You get 2 Theatrical Trailers of the same film, but with different lengths and they are as follows: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1] [01:47]. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel [2015] [1080p] [2.39:1] [01:54].

Sneak Peaks: Here you get a Blu-ray promotion advert for The Sound of Music [1965] [1080p] [2.20:1] This starts to play as soon as your Blu-ray disc loads up.

Finally, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is another rare film that's neither condescending nor perversely sentimental about the process of growing old. At the same time, the sharpness of its writing and the universality of its themes, especially love, guilt and regret, make it enjoyable for just about any adult audience. And then there's the cast, which, performance for performance, might be the best ensemble of the year, with the emotionally acting from especially in particular Dame Maggie Smith, Dame Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup and I must confess to getting very emotional at least twice throughout the film. The film looks and sounds totally wonderful especially on this awesome stunning Blu-ray and definitely making the most out of the colourful, frantic Indian setting, with an equal amount of nice little film features to add to the enjoyment of the Blu-ray disc, which makes the whole experience of viewing The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a joyous and wonderful experience. Very Highly Recommended!

Well, they couldn't. Or else the editing was performed by someone in need of reading glasses - SO choppy and haphazard. To me, the worst part was that they took Dev Patel's Sonny, the disarmingly confident & happy owner of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and replaced him with a frantic, jealous, paranoid, ridiculous buffoon, his previous charming personality no longer recognizable. Thank goodness for Maggie Smith, Bill Naghy, and Judi Dench -- able to overcome the awful script and preserve some dignity in their own roles.",1438214400,5,697,4.915254237288136

Of course it is a simple story told in a strikingly colorful location and with a glittering cast of characters.

The same great characters returned with the handsome addition of Richard Gere, who adds his mystique and charm to this movie.  The movie contained a wedding with all it's rituals of India  and vibrant costumes and simply wonderful dancing. It was a testament to growing older with new found life and not just getting old, which is refreshing these days.  It's about taking chances and letting down your guard and taking charge of fears that paralyze your choices.
Judi Dench and Maggie Smith were on top of their talent as usual and Bill Nighy  was as smoothly bashful as ever.  Dev Patel really steals the show with his youngness but knows how to step up to the plate at the right time for what he believes and who he cares about.

7049270,2,B00UJZQF5A,"As much I enjoyed seeing all the British actors reunited for this sequel, I felt this second film lacked meaning and was not necessary.  The story was not as cohesive or as intelligent as the first; the dialogue was stale and can someone please tell me why Richard Gere was plugged into the sequel? His character made absolutely no sense to me. He looked like he didn't belong in the film as a character and just happened to stumble onto to the set to immediately fall in love with the hotel owner's mother. He was out of his element and out of place. The first film was fantastic and should have been left alone.",1437782400,12,613,4.37719298245614

7049280,1,B00UJZQF5A,"Not only was the acting tired & redundant (i.e. saying the same, overused, clichs with the same acting mannerisms), but the storyline (if you can call it a story) was the same tiresomely redundant (used in film since forever) story of disenfranchised peoples searching for romance with the usual distrust scenes tossed in to resurrect this film's tired heartbeat.
Films of this type our sourced from really cheap paperbacks ($1.99 or e-readers for 99 cents) - basically, writers just changing the locality and names; then plug 'n play.
The acting as well as their character portrayals were both so oldster boring it's understandable that they sought a secluded hotel in India to escape to. Mongolia might have been a more appropriate choice.
Add the also overused plot hook of owners/proprietors waiting for an unknown guest evaluator with the usual not very believable twists; then you have ""The Worst Exotic Marigold Hotel"".",1437696000,,926,5.139072847682119

Maggie Smith and Judy Dench are excellent and understated as usual.  Penelope Whilton's reprise was really not needed, but the Richard Gere storyline was a good replacement for the much missed Tom Wilkenson.  The main storyline is somewhat annoying due to the overacting of the male lead.  The music, cinematography, and India are breathtaking.  Worth the watch.",1437523200,,480,5.089743589743589

The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel differs from the first in that it is a little more serious though the dry British humor is still there and Dev Patel still gives an amazing performance as a slightly hyperactive, impetuous young businessman. If you enjoyed the first movie, I think you will enjoy this one as well. There is more character development and we see the characters thriving in their environment. Obviously, there is an attempt to open a second hotel but it isn't the main plot of the movie. I do think it is helpful to have watched the first movie to understand who everyone is and the dynamics of the relationships. You would miss a lot and I don't think you'd rate this movie that high.

7049525,3,B00UJZQF5A,"This sequel seems to have been written by the same team, but also seems to have been written in a hurry.
It lacks the depth of the first one. To say the least.
The cinematography was poor -- it relied on distance shots when I wanted to see close - ups. Therefore the shots were unmemorable.
The addition of Richard Gere was at best, a waste of time. His lines and part lacked any sense and he, as an actor, is nothing. Worse, he reminded me of a video I saw a few years ago -- live in India! -- in which he and an Indian woman were on a stage and he kept following her around it and trying to grope her though she made it obvious she didn't want to be groped. He seems a sleazy type. I would never go to a movie in which he was featured.
(David Strathairn is advertised as 'the actir' in this movie though he has two bit parts, in the beginning and the end; I didn't even know he was in it because I didn't  recognize him and had to look back when it was over.)
The part of (the young hotel owner's ) mother is either played by a different actor or she has had a face lift.  I thought her acting lacked the quality we saw in Monsoon Wedding (excellent; made by Mira Nair) and the first Marigold Hotel.
The plot was thin. Nothing at all to get interested in. And then it was over. Leaving me completely unsatisfied.",1437091200,,1314,4.05

7049527,4,B00UJZQF5A,"For those charmed by the original BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL be prepared for an also ran very long and low on sparkle runner up. The story the second time around forgot about the appeal of the first story  a charming Indian lad making the best out of a bad situation by creating a cozy and entertaining Indian rest home for aging English folk acted by an outstanding cast of winners. Perhaps that is because this time the screenplay is the invention of Ol Parker who in the first film relied on the charm of Deborah Moggachs novel: he needs her storyline in this version. And he needs a tighter director than John Madden who somehow forgot the themes of the original and let this version go on its own.

Start with Dev Patel who proved in other films and the television series THE NEWSROOM that he can be a fine actor. In this version he is a rude, unlikeable brat. The presence of Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup and the barely noticed appearance of David Strathairn and Richard Gere make the shaky dialog work as well as can be expected, but the purpose of the entry and retreat of others is unnecessary.

The company lays out the plot: The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the expansionist dream of Sonny (Dev Patel), and it's making more claims on his time than he has available, considering his imminent marriage to the love of his life, Sunaina (Tina Desai). Sonny has his eye on a promising property now that his first venture, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful, has only a single remaining vacancy - posing a rooming predicament for fresh arrivals Guy (Richard Gere) and Lavinia (Tamsin Greig). Evelyn and Douglas (Judi Dench and Bill Nighy) have now joined the Jaipur workforce, and are wondering where their regular dates for Chilla pancakes will lead, while Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle) are negotiating the tricky waters of an exclusive relationship, as Madge (Celia Imrie) juggles two eligible and very wealthy suitors. Perhaps the only one who may know the answers is newly installed co-manager of the hotel, Muriel (Maggie Smith), the keeper of everyone's secrets.

7049568,4,B00UJZQF5A,"The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel opens not in India, where The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was set, but in the New York City board room of a corporation that finances retirement properties. Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), the enthusiastic manager of the original hotel, and Mrs. Donnelly (Maggie Smith), the hotels co-manager, are there to make a pitch for funding. While Sonny is extremely nervous since the stakes are high, Mrs. Donnelly calmly delivers an acerbic tirade against what Americans call tea. She immediately makes clear the board of directors are up against more than they bargained for.

 This sequel to the surprise 2011 hit reassembles the original cast and we see how the characters lives in India are progressing. New to the cast is Richard Gere, whose character arrives at the hotel claiming to be a writer. Sonny, however, immediately suspects hes an inspector whos been sent from New York to determine whether to approve a loan for expansion. Also new is Lavinia Beach (Tamsin Grieg of TVs Episodes), whos checking out the hotel as a possible home for her mother.

 Much is happening at the hotel. Sonny is getting ready for his wedding to Sunaina (Tina Desai) but fears that Kushal (Shazad Latif) is trying to steal her away from him. Mrs. Hardcastle (Celia Imre) is juggling the attentions of two Indian millionaire suitors. Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) has been offered a job as buyer for a local company while Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) is trying to find the courage to tell Evelyn how much she means to him. Guy Chambers (Gere) is attracted to Sonnys widowed mother (Lillete Dubey), who is suspicious of his motives. Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) suspects that Carol (Diana Hardcastle) is having an affair.

 Maggie Smith has a much bigger role than in the original, making the most of her unique ability to deliver one-liners with the precision of a whip striking a mosquito on a persons cheek with no collateral damage.

 Director John Madden very smoothly interweaves the story lines so that the movie never seems cluttered. Its fun to re-visit these characters, share their hopes, and enjoy their embrace of life. This is certainly a feel-good movie, with heart and texture. Its sentimental, yet so well acted that we immediately surrender to its charm.

 Sequels often pale in comparison to originals. Happily, The Second best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the exception. It is richer, funnier, more heartfelt, and ultimately more satisfying than its predecessor. Since we already know the characters, writer Ol Parker sweeps us up immediately into the plot lines. Its not even necessary to have seen the first picture. There are enough dialogue, revealing expressions, and action to make perfectly clear what each of these characters is all about.

 Dev Patel brings youthful energy to the role of the thoughtful hotel manager. From his morning attendance calls to make sure no one has died during the night to his frazzled attempts to learn a difficult dance Mr. Patel always succeeds in eliciting a smile.

The movie features several wedding rehearsals, parties and the wedding itself, which not only add color but get everyone in the cast together. Rated PG, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, despite its cumbersome title, is first-rate entertainment.

 Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include the featurettes Filming in India, Returning to the Marigold Hotel, The Marigold Wedding, and Blossoming Relationships. There is also a photo gallery.",1436659200,3,3489,5.075174825174825
7049569,1,B00UJZQF5A,"The characters in the first movie had depth, the script was soulful and full of beauty.  This sequel seems like a cheesy Vegas producer got ahold of it and dumbed-down, cheapened, and made tacky all that had made the first one great. Characters with spine, charisma, and integrity in the first Marigold turned into insipid grouchies or vacuous sleaze balls in this one. In the end of the first, you felt deeply for the rich characters. This one...you're just glad it's over.

7049571,3,B00UJZQF5A,"Whereas the first Exotic Marigold Hotel had the charm of something new, albeit a whitewashed fantasy version of India as a backdrop against which a variety of great British character actors could strut their stuff, the sequel is.... less exotic and far less fresh. For whatever reason the backdrop's unreality is now more evident. The air is clean, the vehicles don't belch thick black smoke, there are no traffic fatalities; indeed the vehicles all seem to be on the correct sides of the road, which is unheard of in the real India (How do you know you're in a city in India? Only 30% of the vehicles are coming straight at you). And real Indian characteristics are touched on only once or twice (""You're lying, aren't you?"" ""Yes, madam."").

So with the faux-Indian backdrop less convincing than ever, the troop of characters has to shoulder more of the thematic burden. But the storyline precludes this because it's a bit dull and unimaginative. There could have been a few good moments, for example when Norman discovers Carol is sleeping with other men and then when he confronts her she responds blithely saying that of course she is because he's been sleeping with an eager woman from their club (which in fact he hasn't). This could have been a really interesting set-up but we whiz through it almost without noticing. And the dithering of Douglas and Evelyn (Bill Nighy and Judy Dench) is just annoying, and the line ""How much time do you think you have?"" which could have been poignant is again just rushed through without any real weight.

So in the end, while it's another charming little fantasy romp and while it is good to see films about older people played by superb actors and actresses, this effort is rather a miss than a hit. With a bit more care (a better script, better direction) it could have been a very satisfying movie but as it is it is more popcorn than caviar.",1436486400,25,1890,4.672672672672673

I've been a fan of British TV and movies since I was in my twenties, so maybe I have a bit of a different take as an American. If you want to escape to India for a couple of hours with some really fine actors, watch The Best Exotic first and follow it with this movie.

Spoiler alert, nothing happens except a wedding and that is boring.  Did they just paste Richard Gere in the movie on cardboard?  All the stars seemed lost with the characters they were playing.  Really...someone should be held accountable for this and issue refunds to everyone.  Not worth the cost or time to watch.  How sad, I was really looking forward to this one coming out.  Whoever wrote/produced this, one question, what did you do to such an wonderful cast of stars to make them ALL look bad?  It's so bad it's embarrassing.",1436054400,10,650,4.723214285714286
