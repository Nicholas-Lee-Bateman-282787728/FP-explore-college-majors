1410235,5,B000059Z8N,"NO this movie is not suited for the ""blockbuster"" audience..and that's what I love about it.  This is (in my opinion) ""good"" acting. The actors& actresses sometimes over do their characters just to make their personalities resonate all the more...I love it.  Nah, no explosions, passionate sex scenes, or shootings...these are like a previous reviewer said, ""regular"" people in an everday setting that somehow can pull you right in.  Hill Harper showed out in this movie...he's absolutely amazing! As well as all of the other actors and actreses...it doesn't feel HOllywood...it feels as though these people enjoyed making this movie, and put their all into it.

GREAT MOVIE!!! And definitely ""Fresh Air"" from this stuffy Cinema Blockbuster, typical storyline plot, pulling from a pool of 25 actors actresses...movies.",1093651200,10,818,5.3671875

1410237,3,B000059Z8N,it gets lost somewhere in the Middle&ending.when I saw the Preview I though it was gonna be a bit more Balanced but it didn't quite get there.interesting at first but it does become a waste&just goes through the Motions after a while. Hill Harper has Talent but this Film doesn't showcase Him fully to me.still worth taking a look at.it has some good moments.,1007251200,4,359,4.625
1410238,2,B000059Z8N,"You want to really like this film. As a change of pace, here is Theodorous Melville, an African American man (Hill Harper) that is not hopelessly cool or in control. His character is solidly middle class and makes no issue of the fact that he's a product of an interracial marriage. It also has an appealing premise about a man who is only able to meet women romantically attached to other men (i.e., ""Jezebels"").
Unfortunately, Harper's performance (particularly in the beginning scenes) is so mannered and cartoonish, that the movie becomes almost unwatchable. It's not enough just to make him awkward, he practically has be slobbering at the mouth like a baby. This lack of subtlety is probably one of the reasons why this film performed poorly during its brief theatrical run.
On the upside, the many women in the film are attractive and some even give interesting performances. Nicole Ari Parker is fun as Frances, the kookiest of the women that Theodorous meets. Laurel Holloman is also fine as Samantha, one of the first of his Jezebels.
With a plethora of generic 'hood movies out there, one can appreciate something a little different. However, most of what we get here is just plain silly. As a result, a lot of talent is wasted in this film and so is the viewer's time.
Writer/director Kywn Bader seems to be starting on the right track with LOVING JEZEBEL, but somehow got derailed after leaving the station. Hopefully, he will have a little more faith in his material next time and tell his story with a lighter touch.",1004572800,7,1531,4.7593984962406015

7934771,4,B000059Z8N,"This movie depicts what everyone has had a taste of at one point ""Loving Jezebel"". Falling for someone that is not theirs. The movie isn't over the top. The cast play the parts well and Hill Harper makes the character easy to relate to.",1310342400,,236,4.386363636363637

7934773,5,B000059Z8N,"Anyone that's ever been caught in between loving someone that is the farthest thing from being ""the one""...should see this movie.  Hill Harper, who I think is a very slept on actor, plays Theodoris Melville, an extremely intelligent, but geeky, guy who is always falling for women who already belong to another man.  The dialogue and narration in this movie are superb and Hollywood really needs to get a clue.  Go out and rent or buy this movie, you will not be disappointed. :)",1166054400,4,479,4.678571428571429
7934774,5,B000059Z8N,"This is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. In every way Loving Jezebel is refreshing. It is an intelligent comedy which leaves behind the cool, predictable characters in traditional romantic comedies and instead displays quirky characters. Hill Harper is phoenomenal as the geek with all of the game. You aren't sure if he's an honest dope who falls into love and is cursed, or someone who inadvertently chases attached women. The racial dynamics were also very refreshing.",1164844800,4,488,5.1125
7934775,5,B000059Z8N,Since purchasing the movie....  I've watched it everday. The first time viewing the movie I cried because I was happy. The second time I viewed it I cried because I was sad. Who knew such a cheesy movie could evoke such emotions? Laurel Holloman fans rejoice!,1122595200,3,259,4.630434782608695
