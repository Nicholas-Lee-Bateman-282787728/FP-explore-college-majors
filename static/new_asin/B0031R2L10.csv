Every time I watch it now I fall more in love with the characters and the story though after just a few short years of watching drama's in both movie and series format certain aspects of the plot are cliche but it's my guilty pleasure nonetheless. I can't believe the movie is so expensive though, it's on my wishlist for sure",1331164800,,496,4.287234042553192
