8493732,5,B00667H680,"I had found the start of this show online and was quickly hooked into it but could not find the rest of it- on DVD or otherwise. I finally found a copy and was ecstatic. If you are a fan of the Asian ghost girl school movies like the Whispering Corridors series, you will love this one.

As the description states, two very close sisters, Ha Na and Doo Na, suffer an unimaginable tragedy and Doo Na dies. It isn't long before Ha Na, experiencing nightmares, realizes her sister Doo Na may be possessing her as she is able to do things no one else can. Thinking she is having a breakdown, her mother has her hospitalized and here she meets the handsome doctor that takes a special interest in her well-being. As it turns out, the doctor may have an ulterior motive to Ha Na's care. It's up to Ha Na to find out what it is before things take a permanent, nasty turn.

This is an all-inclusive series so there is no fear of being left hanging. The copy I received made it seem like a mini-series. The acting, direction and film are all top-notch and the actors all very attractive. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is a fan of Asian horror films.",1375056000,,1159,4.3119266055045875
