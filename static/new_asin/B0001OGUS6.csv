2021675,5,B0001OGUS6,We just love goofy Red Green and the gang at Possum Lodge.  You will either love or hate the loopy humor of this TV series.  We happen to love it and find it refreshingly clever and funny.  (And family-friendly),1168300800,5,211,4.358974358974359
2021676,4,B0001OGUS6,"This DVD first appeared on PBS as a Red Green Special.  For the fans of the R.G. series who never saw Red Green's early appearances on other Canadian shows, and for those who saw them, these raw gems will be a joy to see.  I call them raw because it really looks like they did the early routines without a script!  Red is not as crisp as he is in the later episode performances, but he is still funny. This DVD starts out more like a study in the perfection of Red Green.  I never thought I would use that word to describe Red.
Also included in the PBS special are classic clips from the Red Green show's entire run.  If the clips in the show are leaving you wanting more, you can watch the complete comedy segments in the extras section of the DVD.  Something you could not do watching PBS.
I would still watch the one hour special with Red's new introductions to the clips first, and then watch the extras to see the entire routines.  The comedy holds up on multiple viewings and you get to see something more in the complete versions.  You get a total of over two hours of entertainment.  Even if you have all of the Red Green shows, you will still want this DVD for the early appearances!
I give only **** rating because I would have liked a commentary track or explanation of the segments in the extras section of the DVD.",1086220800,25,1327,4.254980079681275
2021677,4,B0001OGUS6,"Okay, you have to be either Canadian or an American who watches PBS to know who Red Green is.  If you do know him, you probably love him - for reasons that are not quite fully expressible in words.  Red is the Canadian version of Tim Allen on Home Improvement -- only Red is a lot lazier and imcompetent than Tim ever was.  Plus, Red has a far greater gang of fellow loonies and long-suffering relatives and spouses.  Any contribution to the Red Green DVD library is to be very welcomed.  For Americans, a version of this DVD appeared on PBS and gave us an insight into the early days of Red and his friends.  I look forward to sliding the actual DVD into my player for the first time.  Like Red's wife, Bernice, my wife will sit there patiently with me and laugh at the antics of a typical clueless male.",1083369600,17,805,4.256578947368421

8015624,5,B0001OGUS6,"Although this DVD has been out for a while it is never dated. Red Green will live on forever, as will a following, similar to the episodes of MASH. This DVD is a special, but provides some of the best of the past--as the title suggests: ""Red Green's Hindsight is 20/20.""

Many fantastic moments with the crew of Possum Lodge are included. Some are the ""classics"" from Red Green.  Like the Washer/Dryer lawn roller creation which includes a grass seeder.  You gotta love it, and Red Green.

Of course Harold is around, fumbling efforts to make sense of the situations, in his own way.  And Hap Shaughnessy is perhaps the funniest, most outrageous, lair that the world has ever seen.  And plenty of Duct Tape gags.  If your just getting acquainted with the 300 episodes that comprised The Red Green Show, then the PBS special on this DVD is perfect.

When the 60 minutes are over, just go to the extra stuff because they have provided 66 more insanity minutes in the backwoods of Canada.  There is even some never-before-seen Red Green footage (1970's) predating the TV series.  My wife laughed, and laughed, and laughed. Something hilariously but outright preposterous for everyone.

Good for the family. Non violent--if you don't count the attacks and destruction to metal and wooden objects. Great fun.

If you want to save money, buy this DVD along with 3 others in ""Red Green Is Special"" a boxed set. Highly recommended since you will want additional Red Green DVD specials after seeing this one.",1242000000,,1499,4.767441860465116
