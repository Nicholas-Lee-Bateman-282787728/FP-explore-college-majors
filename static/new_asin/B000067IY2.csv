The side humor (about Logansport and Gary) really hit home and all of us country bumpkins can appreciate the fun that was being poked at there.
The characters are portrayed in such a way and demeanor that allows the entire family to watch without any embarassing and awkward moments.  In fact, some of the funniest moments come when Adam attempts to dodge explinations of how he and his ""client""  really know each other.  It is also incredible how he can take his sorrow (from being left at his own wedding) and make sure that it doesn't happen to the groom, which in turn lets him (Adam) realize he's ready for commitment.  It's a sappy, love story with all the perfect...well, EVERYTHING!!",1038787200,3,827,4.516778523489933
1715371,4,B000067IY2,"Having grown up in a small town such as Grass Creek and now living in a South Florida Coastal town, I find this movie very refreshing and uplifting. No violence, no sex scene and still the plot and characters are interesting enough to keep you watching. I had a chance to visit Grass Creek recently and ran across some of the genuine people of this quaint town. Many were in the movie as extras and some had speaking parts. They really are ""a nice bunch of folks"".",1034294400,2,464,4.344827586206897
1715372,5,B000067IY2,"This marvelous gem deals with one man's battle with his devastating past and his ensuing ""marriage-phobia.""  Charming, funny, and well-acted, I recommend this movie to anyone, but especially to people who never seem to get around to popping the question.
After all, you don't want to become a Lester.....",1028073600,,304,5.204081632653061
1715373,2,B000067IY2,"...This is a film that you hate to criticize because it is apparent that it was filmed with good intentions, excellent production values and good acting. But the painful truth is that it is an awfully slow movie (at times excruciating but you keep thinking that it might pick up - it doesn't), and there are very few laughs in it. The funniest thing about it is the fact that Megan Mullaly is given the starring credit on the dvd box and she has a total of about three lines and less than three minutes of screen time! Talk about false advertising! So what if the film has no offensive language or violence? Those factors alone do not make a good film.",1027728000,2,652,4.352459016393443
1715374,5,B000067IY2,"First of all, let me say that I'm fed up with movies today.  I hate all the sex, nudity, cussing, sin, glorification of self, and horrible morals and values that are shoved down our throats in every film.
This film has none of those.  I believe this is a good movie made by good people for good people.  I thought it was hilarious, wholesome, and one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Even though it was low-budget, it was still undeniably professional.  It may have a word or two in it that I don't care for, but I'm not certain because it's been over a year since I last saw it.  But my overall impression of it was unbelievably better than American Pie (1 or 2), Half Baked, any Tom Green movie, Scary Movie, etc; even though I admit to not seeing most of these.
If your tired of all the sin in the world, this movie will give you an overwhelming breath of fresh air.  Praise the Lord for films like these!",1026950400,3,911,4.2011494252873565
1715375,5,B000067IY2,"I am the present pastor of Grass Creek United Methodist Church. It's the only church in Grass Creek, Indiana. I came after the filming was completed. The movie was shot on several locations in our area. The church used was actually Fletcher's Lake UMC because of it's location. The movie was wonderful! Many of our own locals were featured and we enjoyed viewing the movie with some who acted in it. They gave us background information. This is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. I can't wait to get my copy. I'm sorry it didn't do better in the theaters. It should win an award. My son is a film studies student at IU and said it was one of the best films he's seen in a long time. Kudos to all who were involved.",1024358400,11,720,4.262773722627737
1715376,5,B000067IY2,Enjoyed seeing this movie with 3 generations in my family.  Plenty of humor for all ages.  This film takes many twists and turns for a completely enjoyable experience.,1023840000,3,167,4.928571428571429
7962810,5,B000067IY2,Hubby and I are in it for about half a second... Definitely 5 stars. ;) But seriously it is really a very good movie. Fun and you can play it without worrying the kids might walk through the room.  Wish they'd team up for more...,1490572800,,229,4.088888888888889

7962812,5,B000067IY2,Saw maybe years ago when my children were young. It is a bit goofy and could never be considered a classic but it is a fun movie when you just want to sit back and relax.,1462665600,,170,3.75

7962814,5,B000067IY2,Fav movie that depicts the area nicely.  Many good laughs.  Visited Grass Creek; it's a lovely little Midwestern community.  Recommend for fun.,1382140800,,143,5.409090909090909
7962815,3,B000067IY2,"""Best man in grass creek"" starring John Newcombe, John Hines, Megan Mullally, Grace Phillips and Oskana Fedunyszyn feels like a low-budget B-grade movie. The plot is very simple, the jokes feel desperate and you get the feeling they were hard-up for ideas.

Yet as the film ends you get a satisfying 'happy-ending', a warm fuzzy feeling inside and feel as if you just watched a 'good movie'. So even if you don't really get presented with many impressive ideas, you get what you want out of a film-watching experience.

Adam is a very genuine character, as is his doting fiancee to be, Holly. Everyone else seems quite nice, if a little bit oddball. Let's say it's a rom-com that light  on the rom, even lighter on the com, and really enjoyable nonetheless. Rating six out of ten.",1338681600,,780,4.678832116788321
7962816,5,B000067IY2,it was neat to see backrounds and props from a town that i have been going to since a child,1212969600,,91,3.6
7962817,5,B000067IY2,"I wouldn't want to watch this movie, if I were in the mood to watch, say, Anna Karenina.  However, taken on it's own merits, this movie is wonderful.  It's funny, light-hearted, and is good because the characters are good. The main character, Adam, is afraid to commit to marriage, not because he's selfish, but because he was deeply hurt in the past.  His girlfriend, Holly, is ready to settle down, yet genuinely loves Adam and is willing to wait.  Another character, Jimmy, comes to realize before his wedding that his fiance', Dee, is a control freak, yet he loves her anyway. Adam does everything he can to prevent Jimmy from hurting Dee in the same way he was hurt in the past.  Holly and Adam are subjected to a lot of irritating people and situations in their trip to Indiana, yet they never become rude--they bear everything with grace and kindness. This movie has a sweetness that is hardly ever found in movies now days.  It was a joy to watch.",1173830400,,955,4.555555555555555
7962818,5,B000067IY2,"I wrote a very cruel review for this film despite the fact that I never saw it.  I was being petty and selfish and I apologize.  Please disregard the review (1 Star, Viewer from Chicago).
Thank you.",1082592000,,198,4.324324324324325
7962819,5,B000067IY2,"I am originally from Grass Creek, Indiana and that isn't the only reason why I love this video.  It is funny, heartwarming, a great family video for anyone to watch, especially if you know a groom with cold feet!  The movie is true (sometimes unfortunately) to Hoosiers and as I said before, it's hilarious.  Small towns from the Grass Creek-Kewanna area were used in the film and locals were used as extras, my old neighbor Dave Sommers even played a sizeable role as the best man's main sales competition. Buy this movie and you'll enjoy it for sure.",1045267200,2,552,4.612244897959184
