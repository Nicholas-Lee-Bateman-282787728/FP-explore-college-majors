6564638,5,B00M8HWGU0,"Wonderful! Great section on how to do the poses correctly and the common mistakes. I wish I would have purchased this yoga workout first. Absolute necessity to watch to be sure all poses are performed correctly so you get the most out of yoga and don't hurt yourself. I think people who give up on yoga don't have proper instruction. Add to that Rodney Yee's calm and soothingly supportive voice, and we have the ultimate winner yoga workout for beginners as well as those who want to be sure their forms are correct but can't afford or don't know a good instructor.",1414972800,170,566,4.5588235294117645

6564657,2,B00M8HWGU0,"disappointed that this is advertised for beginners, He rifles through poses and very frustrating.",1505174400,,97,6.0
6564658,5,B00M8HWGU0,Very nice for beginners. Slow motions and transitions with options to use blocks or a strap.,1504483200,,92,4.8125
6564659,1,B00M8HWGU0,"I had just bought 3 of Rodney's CDs for beginners. Beginner: a person just starting to learn a skill or take part in an activity.
They do not show any modified positions instructions on how the body stretches and how to release point of pressure to obtain these advanced positions they show on all of their CDs that I bought. The CDs are not for beginners they show nothing but advanced poses. I was hoping that they would show how to achieve an advanced pose from a stiff body...you cannot achieve the poses they show as a beginner. Wish I could return these CDs as I am on a limited income.",1504137600,8,592,4.342342342342342
6564660,1,B00M8HWGU0,"Very disappointed before I started.  Rodney Yee is probably a fine yoga instructor but his DVD offers a free download if you visit their website.  I did and all the site contained was a sales pitch for more merchandise.  I have no problem with selling or upselling but a completely false offer just to get you to the web page is unethical.
His credibility is zero for me  - Now to watch the DVD and see what it contains.",1503792000,,420,4.2784810126582276
6564661,2,B00M8HWGU0,No doubt Rodney Yee is a yoga master. Problem for me is that he seems to go fast through the moves and doesn't spend time showing a beginner how to do it.,1502496000,,154,3.84375
6564662,3,B00M8HWGU0,Nope.  If you have never done yoga before and are unfamiliar with the various positions it may be difficult to follow as Rodney quickly transitions from 1 move to the next.,1502236800,,172,4.548387096774194
6564663,1,B00M8HWGU0,Worst yoga video ever! Do not waste your money.,1502150400,,47,4.333333333333333
6564664,5,B00M8HWGU0,"Really great intro to yoga! I bought this DVD after reading the reviews when I got interested in yoga but wasn't brave enough to go to a class. I quickly got pretty comfortable with all 4 of the routines and moved on to other routines I found on YouTube; this was such a great place to start!! Highly recommend. The only downside for me was the DVD says you can download a pose guide for easy reference which I was REALLY looking forward to (since it doesn't walk you through step-by-step each pose) but the link provided for this does not work and I was not able to get help from the website. Otherwise, totally great.",1501718400,,619,4.344827586206897

6564667,3,B00M8HWGU0,Ok beginners video.  Does start out expecting you to know names of poses,1499731200,,72,4.538461538461538

6564670,2,B00M8HWGU0,Not so good----too much advertising and takes forever to get to the programs. Also several of the programs are too much downward dog---my wrists end up killing me! I love Rodney Yee but this is not worth the small amount they charge for it.,1497484800,,240,4.4772727272727275
6564671,3,B00M8HWGU0,So I purchased this based on the number of orders and positive customer reviews.  I feel that the instructor transitions too quickly from one pose to the next with not enough explanation and/or time to be sure you're doing everything correctly.  I find it strange that the instructor isn't speaking but instead is a voice off camera - I find it a little distracting.  There wasn't enough verbal instruction about doing poses correctly in my opinion.  Somewhat disappointed. Also the ridiculous amount of advertisements in the beginning is super annoying.  I know I can skip through them but who wants to do that every single time you just want to do some yoga?  I have many other exercise DVDs and they don't have one single advertisement.  This part was super lame to me.  But I will say the relaxation module is very nice.,1497052800,4,824,4.713286713286713

6564675,5,B00M8HWGU0,I do appreciate that it is easy to follow for beginners or those that needed s slower pace due to mobility issues. He is calm but energizing and well taught.

6564677,4,B00M8HWGU0,I have done some yoga but it's been so many years I decided to try this first. I have used his other videos and enjoyed them. The only issue is I'm getting an error message when I try to access the downloadable pose guide.,1494288000,2,222,4.068181818181818
6564678,5,B00M8HWGU0,My wife and I love this DVD. It gives a great overview and explains how to use yoga for a variety of goals. I would certainly recommend this dvd for anyone wanting to get started in yoga. Mr. Yee has a very calming voice and is easy to listen to.,1494115200,,246,3.94

6564681,3,B00M8HWGU0,Frankly a little boring. But it does help with poses and timing. I bought this for my kids and I to do together. They couldn't make it 10 minutes.,1492560000,,146,4.068965517241379

6564696,5,B00M8HWGU0,I haven't done much yoga in my life. So based on the reviews for this DVD I decided to give it a try. This DVD really is for beginners.

6564720,3,B00M8HWGU0,"I have never done yoga or even really seen anyone actually doing it so I really am a total beginner.  The exercises were excellent for a complete beginner and despite being a middle aged woman with both moderate rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis I was able to achieve most of the poses without much difficulty.  If I couldn't quite get the exact stretch, I simply moderated it a bit. So far, so good.

I finally hit a snag when he started some seated poses and being completely unfamiliar with them I had difficulty figuring out how to achieve the correct pose.  My suggestion, keep the remote handy and hit the pause button.  It took me a few tries to achieve the correct position.  It became even more challenging trying to do any of the positions while I was face down.  At that point I got a knot in my neck trying to look sideways and up at the TV.  Placement of every single body part is important and the devil is in the details, which he does not explain very much.

I decided to watch the floor exercises a few times before actually trying to do them again so I could figure out what I was supposed to be doing when I couldn't actually see it.  If you have a laptop that you can set on the floor in front of your nose it might be somewhat easier.

I also purchased a book that has very good photographs of the most basic poses that Rodney performs which allowed me to study each position before I tried it again with the video.  The book doesn't even mention how to center, balance and ground yourself like Rodney does, which was essential for me start feeling a real inner balance.  However, the book has a lot of detail about breathing cycles; when to breathe in, breathe out and the importance of synchronizing your breathing with the exercise.  When I tried to sync the breathing instructions in the book with the grounding instructions in the video I realized that the proper timing of your breaths is not at all intuitive but it did make a significant difference in the effectiveness of the poses and movements.

I enjoy the video.  It's soothing, conversational and flows seamlessly through the poses, but without the breathing cycles it's not as effective as it could be.

I love the video.  I was able to do all of the exercises and will have to watch the floor poses a few times before actualy trying them again  but for a real beginner more instructions on the coordination of breathing and movement would be extremely helpful.",1482105600,14,2453,4.496613995485327

6564722,5,B00M8HWGU0,"Pretty simple poses that teach you the basics of yoga. I also really like that they are shorter versions of the practice and that there are different ones to choose from. I usually do yoga in the mornings, so I don't have a lot of time. This is also a gentle way to wake up and get moving and not terribly taxing on the body.

6564741,5,B00M8HWGU0,"This is a good video for beginners or people who are out of practice or lack flexibility for the standard yoga poses.  This is also good for more experienced practitioners who want to work on improving their poses or do a quick warmup routine. The Basic workout and flexibility workout are my favorites - I feel like in these I get a good balance of working on poses, building strength and balance, and increasing flexibility.  The energy and relaxation sequences I find not to be as useful personally. Rodney Yee does a good job of providing instruction to improve a pose.  Unlike a lot of his videos, he spends plenty of time in a couple of these workouts in each pose instead of quickly moving onto the next.  He employs the use of straps and blocks to modify for inflexibility and often demonstrates this instead of just talking about it.  Each routine is new and not just a rehash of earlier releases.  Each of the 4 routines is a little over 20 minutes - short enough to help people fit it into a busy schedule but long enough to feel improvement. This also comes with a downloadable pose guide - not very detailed but not bad - and a downloadable 10 minute express Yoga workout also done by Rodney Yee.",1468454400,3,1209,4.472727272727273

I love the narration (voice is a guy from the old TV show Wings and he is great with this) that provides enough information that you don't have to stay glued to your TV to understand the pose.  It is a beginner DVD.  My ONLY complaint and the reason its 4 stars instead of 5 is that Rodney constantly pulls the hem of his shorts down - very annoying!",1464566400,5,431,4.156626506024097

6564797,5,B00M8HWGU0,"I can't say enough about this routine, and about Rodney, except that I started with this program a month ago and, if you'd told me how far I'd come in such a short time and how much better I'd feel after my very first attempt, I'd have said you were insane.  Instead, I'm already more flexible, my legs are stronger, and I'm so much more at peace, mentally.  Rodney is a wonderful instructor:  his routine flows well and he doesn't rush through things.  It may look easy but it's not!  It is a great place for beginners:  not too hard, but not to easy - there is plenty of challenge in these routines.

I go through the first three sections, then the relaxation session, all in one go after work and I sleep like a log.  There is also a ""for the yogi on the go"" 15 minute section that moves a bit more quickly than the other three, for when you don't have time for a complete workout with the other practices.

I 100% recommend Yee's DVD as a terrific introduction to yoga.  Stick with it, too - it'll show you results you won't believe.  Plus I've now bought several more of Rodney's DVDs, and his wife Colleen's ""Yoga for Weight Loss"".  Can't wait to get into them too!",1443571200,20,1171,4.2727272727272725

Recently I bought several beginner's yoga DVDs, including this one, so that I can switch up the routines and hear the same poses being explained by different instructors. Yee has a clear, concise, constructive way of describing and demonstrating the poses. Each of the sessions is 20 minutes long, which fits into my tight morning schedule fairly well. Three weeks into practicing yoga every day, I am now moving into longer practices with some of my other DVDs; with this one, on my longest work days I am following one routine in the morning and a second in the evening.

(This, of course, is a flaw of all yoga DVDs.) But specific to Yee, he doesn't spend enough time explaining how to position blocks to help get into a position. He just shows it briefly, and it looks so easy. But he stops using the block immediately, instead of staying with it so beginners can be confident.

Rodney is wonderful; he focuses on actual physical responses rather than mysticism.",1427155200,25,332,5.166666666666667

6564831,5,B00M8HWGU0,"I am new to yoga, and have only been attending classes for about a month. This video is ideal for my home practice. Rodney Yee is an excellent instructor and explains everything well. The DVD is divided into four sections, beginner, flexibility, energy, and relaxation.

A review in in Yoga Journal magazine is where I first heard of this program. They said it is an excellent DVD for beginners. I am glad I took their advice and bought it.

 If you are new to yoga, thinking about getting started, or don't have a studio in your area and want to learn at home, I believe that you would find this DVD to be very helpful.",1425254400,158,620,4.373913043478261
6564832,5,B00M8HWGU0,"I had a yoga video years ago by Rodney Yee that I loved & then lost. I am glad I decided to get this DVD for starting up again. The first session goes threw the poses (not all, but many) at a nice pace. You will need a strap for a few of the poses (possibly blocks). Really enjoyed this yoga video.",1424995200,65,298,3.8225806451612905

8670741,3,B00M8HWGU0,I was not to impressed with yoga.  But did not like it.  I wanted more of a workout.  But will keep the CD just in case I decide to like It.  Someone else may just love this CD.  You have to make your own decision on this.  Sorry I am not much help.,1533513600,,249,3.6037735849056602
8670742,3,B00M8HWGU0,"I decided that I would like to learn a little yoga to add to my exercise choices. This seemed like a good choice. It is not easy, but I am fit and thought I'd be able to do it without a problem. The problem is that while following the video, the voices are much too low. Even turning up the volume doesn't make them easy to hear as they seem muffled. That results in having to watch everything on the screen, which makes for some difficulty. Trying to figure out what he is saying while in downward dog is tough. I suspect watching it a few times without doing it at the same time might help.",1533340800,,592,4.112068965517241
