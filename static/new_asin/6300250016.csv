And NBA Finals Lakers vs Celtics with the lakers climbing on top 4-2. This video also shows a sense of Humor, They include segments of ""Ugliest Car"" (Billy Thompson). ""Best Hair"" (Pat Riley). ""Beach Bum"" (Kurt Rambiis). ""Worst Shot"" (Wes Matthews). ""Best Singer"" (Byron Scott woo woo). The lakers in the 1986-87 went 65-17 in the regular season and 15-3 in the postseason combining them with a 80-20 record. Watch Magic win his first MVP and Coop win DPOY. And how can we forget the trade of the year that saved the Lakers, Mychal Thompson. IMO the 1986-87 Lakers were the greatest team of all time. I don't think we will ever see another team like that again. 5 Stars All The Way!!!!!!!!",1151884800,,842,4.695945945945946
