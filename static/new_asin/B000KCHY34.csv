2688112,4,B000KCHY34,I wish I had known this was for region 4. None of my DVD players will play PAL. Now the only way my kids can watch it is in the computer room and its not big enough to turn around in let alone work out.,1169164800,,202,3.511111111111111
2688113,5,B000KCHY34,"We got this for our two boys (3 and 6) and they won't stop playing it.  If they're not jumping around infront of the DVD, they are playing the CD that came with it and jumping around to it.

It's a big ask for a little girl to carry on Steve's legacy, but this is a fantastic start.  Good luck Bindi.",1167350400,,300,3.8852459016393444
2688114,5,B000KCHY34,"I bought this DVD for my kids and they loved it. It is for kids between the ages of preschool and around age 8 years. It shows Bindi in her tree house, and she talks about animals, and things to do for entertainment other than watching TV. She even advises kids that when the DVD is over, to go outside and jump around! Steve, Terri, Bindi and her Crocmen all are in this DVD. It is also about some of the zoo animals in their zoo, and gives fun facts about the animals. Steve cooks up a messy storm in the kitchen, which is kind of silly, but kid's love it. Also, in this DVD a CD is supplied, and it has the same songs that Bindi and her Crocmen sing on the DVD. Included is a poster type photo of Bindi that can be framed. It's delightful and fun, and will get your kids doing some dances with Bindi and the Crocmen. They will love it! Terri acts as a back-up singer in some of the songs. It's fun for the kids (and some parents too)! My advice, this DVD is not worth the asking price of forty dollars. It's only 45 minutes long, and kind of silly, but for kids it's cute. I ordered this from the seller ""westendentertainment"" (received it in only 8 days) , and it was for all regions, but was in PAL format, and wouldn't play on my U.S. made DVD player. It did play on my computer, and the music CD works on any CD player made in the U.S., so to be able to watch the DVD, we have to play in only on our computer. It was not in the NTSC format like advertised.",1166313600,11,1463,3.9965870307167237
2688115,5,B000KCHY34,"This DVD is perfect for preschool to about the age of 8. It's delightfully made with Bindi, her dad Steve, her mom Terri, and the Australian Zoo Crocmen. They sing to around nine new songs while doing aerobic types of dance routines for your child to exercise (dance) to. Also, this DVD comes with a booklet with the words to each song that Bindi sings. It also comes with a music CD. Steve demonstrates his silly, and messy cooking skills while cooking up a storm in the kitchen making low calorie snacks for your child. In the booklet are the recipes made on this DVD. This part of the DVD I found rather silly, since Steve used his shirt to wipe his hands, and also didn't use any hot mitts (used bare hands) to removed foods from the oven (lets show kids the proper way here), also he burned just about everything he made! It also shows some of his zoo animals. Very cute, and a fine collection for your child's DVD library. Most of these DVD's are made for Australia's region, so make sure if you're from the U.S., that you buy one with Region 1 on it. Bindi dances with her Crocmen in the Crocoseum (on stage) in their Australia Zoo, so this is a fun DVD for your children to experience dancing, singing and watching those cute little animals. Also, your child with learn some fun facts about some of the animals that are shown on her DVD. Have fun! Your child won't even realize they are getting some exercise while they dance to this DVD. Worth buying! I ordered this from the seller ""westendentertainment"" on this website. When the DVD came it wasn't wrapped in clear wrap like all other DVD's are, when I popped it into the DVD player and it wouldn't play. It is made for all regions, but it's in PAL format, not NTSC format (like the advertisement said) for our country (USA), so I couldn't play it on our U.S. made DVD player, but it played on our computer, so that's how my kids get to watch it. Kids will like dancing with Bindi as she sings about her favorite animals. It's a cute DVD for kids. According to all I've read about this DVD, it was made 8 months before Steve's untimely death. This was his latest DVD, besides the filming of Bindi's new show ""Bindi, the Jungle Girl"", which only 6 or 7 episodes were filmed with Steve before he died. This DVD will be treasured by many children. Also in this DVD came a 7 X 9 1/2"" picture of Bindi that can be framed for your child's bedroom. What all little fans love!",1164672000,11,2430,4.3428571428571425
8155564,5,B000KCHY34,"Love it. Love Bindi. Love the Crocmen. And my grandaughter (2) loves it also. I mean.. really really loves it !  :) giggles, sings, dances, does actions and just all round has a fabulous time and asks for it every day.. for months now... :)",1416009600,,240,4.333333333333333
8155565,2,B000KCHY34,"I think this is an excellent DVD! 4 of my kids (1-9 years) love to join  in. However, it does not play on anything but my windows computer...not dvd and not Mac. This is inconvenient and frustrating to say the least. I will not be purchasing from this site, oddbanana, again!!!",1286323200,,277,4.431372549019608
8155566,5,B000KCHY34,"We originally bought this as a gift for a 5 year old that loves Bindi Irwin.  Unfortunately, we ordered from someone else and when she got the gift it would not play - I didn't realize that version only plays on Australian DVD players.  I ordered this one from Amazon.com and it did play on her dvd player in tennessee and she absolutely loves it.  Her mom said she's memorized the songs already.",1269648000,,396,4.397260273972603
8155567,5,B000KCHY34,My granddaughter is a Bindi fan and she loves this video.  She is only two but finds this entertaining and enjoys trying to follow the dance moves.  The cooking segments are cute and funny but makes me worry that perhaps some children would think messing around in the kitchen would be ok.  We love this video!,1231113600,,310,4.5
8155568,5,B000KCHY34,"I bought this DVD because my 2 year old LOVES Bindi's TV shows on Discovery Kids. We are very selective about what she's allowed to watch on TV, and she became hooked on Bindi very quickly. My only complaint about the TV show was that there wasn't enough dancing, as my daughter loved the dancing the most. Bindi Kid Fitness is wonderful because the video is mostly comprised of the music/dancing portions of her TV shows. There are also some silly bits on exercise and cooking with her late dad. This DVD was a must in our family, and I think that most toddlers to preschoolers would really enjoy it.",1206748800,,601,4.472727272727273
8155569,5,B000KCHY34,"Bindi and her Dad, Steve Irwin do a nice job of doing a kid's exercise video, mixed with some cooking and some really funny shots.  My 3-1/2 yr. old really enjoys this video, she sings along and dances and gets some exercising in as well.  They do a pretty good job with mixing the songs with the dancing on an animal theme.",1199664000,,324,4.209677419354839
8155570,4,B000KCHY34,"My daughter loves the action and energy of this DVD. It gets her moving and dancing with Bindi. It also makes her curious about the animals that are metioned and sung about. She loves Bindi. Good sound quality and picture. My only issue is the fact that it won't play on my panasonic DVD player, it will however play on the coby portable one.",1193184000,,342,4.359375
8155571,5,B000KCHY34,"Bindi Irwin does a fantastic job in her very first DVD.  She has a sweet singing voice and does a great job on the 8 songs she sings.  Her Crocmen are great and all of them sing and dance up a storm.

There are 9 songs featured on the DVD, all about animals like tigers, elephants, crocodiles, monkeys, cheetahs, kangaroos, eagles.  In between the songs she cooks healthy meals with her dad Steve (all of which somehow do not work out the way they planned - which is hilarious to child viewers) and demonstrates ways kids can keep fit and healthy like walking the dog, playing ball games, swimming, bike riding and jumping on the trampoline.  She also talks about lots of animals.

This is a fantastic DVD, It is aimed at kids about 7-12 I would say but I love it and I'm in my 20s. The songs and dances give anyone a good arobic workout and are very catchy and fun.

Crikey what a ripper DVD/CD set. Can't wait to hear more from Bindi!!",1175299200,,937,4.2897727272727275
8155572,5,B000KCHY34,"This DVD is divided into a number of short recurring segments:

1. Bindi introduces each performance with a few fun facts about an animal that the song talks about.

2. Bindi and the Crocmen peform the song in a nice studio setting (Steve and Terri play some instruments).  Each song has moves to go with it so that kids can exercise along.  Since the songs are about animals, the moves also go along with how animals move.  There are 9 songs total (the crocmen, eagles, elephants, hippos, monkeys, tigers, kangaroos, cheetas, and snakes).  The tunes are catchy and fun (also included on a separate CD; the words for all songs are included in the accompanying booklet).

3. Bindi introduces other fun exercises that kids can do outdoors.  She demonstrates these exercises briefly with her dad.  Steve is always silly in these and the kids love it.

4. Cooking with Steve and Bindi - they show how to make healthy snacks.  Again, it is kind of a silly segment, but the kids like this also.  The recipes are for real though, and are included in the accompanying booklet.

I definitely enjoy watching this DVD with my little niece and nephew.  Bindi is a natural in front of the camera.  It's really great to see her having fun with her dad on this DVD.  She also does an excellent job getting a number of important messages across to other children.

It looks like there has been some confusion and concern about this DVD not working in U.S. players.  This is only the case if you get the PAL version.  Make sure you order the NTSC version and it should work just fine (the same applies to Canada).  Customers from European countries or Australia should get the PAL version.  It looks like Amazon is selling the NTSC format (even though some sellers from Australia have mistakenly sent the wrong version).  Also, this DVD is region free, so you only need to pay attention to the NTSC format and don't need to worry about regions.",1172188800,5,1927,4.589442815249267
