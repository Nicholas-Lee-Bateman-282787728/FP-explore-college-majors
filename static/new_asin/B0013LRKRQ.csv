3117802,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Okay my wife and I fell hook line and sinker for the ""Love Comes Softly"" Series. No nudity, no extreme violence, no profanity and definitely a Christian influence inserted but not overbearing or a desire to convert you. We had collected from $2 to $4 locally, used, 1-5 and then #7 and one of the two prequels. We hit a dead end on #6 and #8 and the other prequel - so we're turning to Amazon to complete our series ""collection"" with those we don't have.

This sixth installment is done in the overall style and ""atmosphere"" as it's five predecessors. Missie's (Erin Cottrell) adopted daughter, Belinda, desires to become a doctor and is overall the main focus (and the setup for the seventh movie.) Belinda is portrayed extremely well by the beautiful and enthusiastic Scout Taylor-Compton. She starts with the local doctor whom grudgingly gives her a chance to work with a very wealthy and elderly female stroke victim from back east - Boston. And (par for the times) the doctor as well as others think a doctors job is one for the men only. Belinda also starts getting to assist the doctor and by the movie's end has earned his respect and endorsement to become a doctor.

The wealthy woman overcomes the effects of her stroke with Belinda's dedicated and persistent daily ""physical therapy"", so to speak. So much so that she becomes an admirer and supporter of Belinda's passionate desire to be a doctor. She graciously ""rewards"" Belinda with an offer to go to Boston and pay her entire tuition and expenses to become a doctor. Belinda's mother and grandmother and grandfather (Dale Midkiff - for the last time) all are here - yet you sense and can clearly see their roles becoming increasingly diminished. Then quite predictably the seventh movie becomes all about Belinda's, having become a doctor, initial efforts as a new practicing doctor (reviewed in the seventh movie section.)

If you've come this far in the series buy this sixth installment as well as #7. It's really not as good as the ones before it. The overall aura and feeling from the first five movies remains basically intact, though not as good as the first three. None the less - it's a very good, wholesome, entire family viewing production. The standard rugged western frontier setting (this is more set in town) and the male characters keeps it's male appeal basically intact; though lessened somewhat - it keeps it from being a ""chick flick."" It's female appeal is more visible and stands more to the front. Still a pretty good flick, stays basically on course with the series. The Mrs. and I both love it and give it a well deserved five stars.",1406764800,3,2623,4.722707423580786

My little sister was really sad when she had no gift for my mom for Christmas. And then when I had to tell her that the dvd wasn't coming at all, she was even more bummed. I contacted the seller and said I wanted the product still but if that was impossible then I needed a refund as t had already been over a month since I ordered it. They just told me it was lost and they refunded my money. Complete disappointment. Won't order again from them.",1391299200,,562,4.072072072072072
3117812,3,B0013LRKRQ,"This movie is so far away from the book that it shouldn't even be compared.  Belinda is in this book, that's true.  I don't think she is planning on becoming a nurse yet though, but I can't really remember...

In this movie, Belinda is all grown up and has dreams of being a doctor.  She wants to be tutored by the town doctor but he's against this.  Missie and the Sheriff are married now and he's good ol' Dad.  Perhaps I'm still bitter the writer's killed Willie off...But this is a sweet, wholesome movie in it's own right.  The only original actor left is Clark...",1389225600,,569,4.3619047619047615

3117822,5,B0013LRKRQ,Good clean family entertainment with a good message. I recommend this and the whole series. It is a great western type movie with a good story line.,1372809600,,148,4.518518518518518
3117823,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Possibly one of my favorite movies. I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Love's Unfolding Dream was really quite clean. A man has a leg amputated not show on screen (although I think you see a little of the leg with the infection before hand) he also eventually dies; a young girl needs surgery, but nothing is shown. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.

I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry. So I only watch certain ones. Love Begins first (since is covers how the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream. They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.

Belinda dreams of a career in medicine, but the town doctor doesn't agree.  He thinks a woman should get married.  Her medical expertise (that she has learned through books since most medical collages won't accept women) is put to the test wehn she nurses a Boston socialite, Mrs. Stafford Smith, back to health after a stroke.  There tempers very often get the better of them, but Mrs. Smith eventually gets to know Belinda better and wants to help her achieve her dream and offers to pay for medical school.  Drew, an attorney who came to town to sell his deceased uncle's farm, changes his way of thinking about women and encourages Belinda in her dream.  As he falls in love with Belinda, she must decide if it's possible to be in love and follow your dreams. Meanwhile, Missy is enjoying her life with her new husband Zach, the town sheriff, and their two sons (Maddie, from her first marriage; and Jacob who is Belinda's brother).  She also insists on interfering with a neighboring family by teaching the mother how to read, by offering her a job helping out at the school.

Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",1372636800,,2314,4.583535108958838

3117848,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Whenever you see the words ""based on"" you know the film isn't going to follow the original story...as proves the case in this series.  I don't usually like films that are ""based on"" - particularly if I have loved the original stories - but I did enjoy this series directed by Michael Landon Jr. If you can accept these aren't the stories of the books written by Christian author Janette Oke, they are an enjoyable set of films of love & faith to watch in their own right. ""Love's Long Journey"" is my favourite in this series, but this film is a close second.

In this film:
Belinda Tyler has grown up and has a deep longing to be a doctor - a dream that is supported by her family. When Dr. Jackson advertises for an assistant, Belinda is there like a flash. Dr. Jackson believes women should be at home & isn't keen on having her work for him, but with faith & hard work, Belinda starts winning hearts who believe she should be in the profession. These include a wealthy dowager whom Belinda nurses back to full strength, Dr. Jackson himself, & visiting lawyer Drew Simpson. Belinda has always thought that to succeed as a doctor, her other dream for love would have to take second place. Only then Drew Simpson arrives to invade her heart. After his initial surprise at Belinda's choice of profession, he comes to see she is perfect for the job & supports her dream...now he just has to convince her that she can train to be a doctor and be married to him also!

Great acting, no violence, no swearing, and no sexuality make this another hit for families looking for a great movie for ""Family Night"" where they don't have to worry about the content of typical Hollywood fare.

3117861,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Love's Unfolding Dream is a wonderful film based on the books of Janette Oke, an excellent writer of solid and heartwarming stories. In Love's Unfolding Dream, Belinda, Missy's adopted daughter, dreams of one day becoming a doctor. Unfortunately Belinda lives in a time when women doctors were unheard of and shunned. Unfazed, Belinda still dreams of one day attending college and medical school and returning to her hometown as a doctor. She eventually becomes the unspoken assistant to the town's doctor while administering therapy to a wealthy and opinionated stroke victim, who we later find out has lived through much tragedy in her own life. Along the way, a handsome lawyer comes to town and makes Belinda question her dreams, aspirations, and God's plan for her life.

I read Janette Oke's books as a teenager and found them all to be wonderful. This series of films based on the books are just as wonderful and I would highly recommend the entire family-oriented series! You won't be disappointed!",1229990400,,1006,5.023952095808383

3117883,4,B0013LRKRQ,"""Love's Unfolding Dream"" is based on bestselling author Janet Oke's novel and is the sixth in the Love Comes Softly series.  It's a coming of age tale of Belinda Taylor (Scout Taylor-Compton), the will-of-her-own adopted daughter of a former heroine Missie Lahaye (Erin Cottrell).  Belinda is determined to live her own life and become a doctor in this story set in the era of buggies and stagecoaches.

With her mind made up and after reading as much as she can on medicine, Belinda approaches the town doctor, Doc Jackson (Robert Pine), and asks that he let her be his assistant.  He point blank tells her he doesn't need a nurse and that the medical profession is no place for a young lady who should be really thinking about finding a man, marrying him and staying home as the dutiful wife.  Belinda won't take no for an answer and Doc lets her assist him with his daily medical duties.

She's happy to assist and learn all she can from Doc until a stranger, Drew Simpson (Patrick Levis), shows up and tells her she should be happy to live life in the small town as a happily married wife of some lucky man.  Belinda is indignant that someone from New York City, a lawyer, would have the gall to tell her what she can and can't do.  Meanwhile, Drew is falling for Belinda as he works to refurbish the home left him when his relative passed away.

Belinda believes in the power of prayer and she wants to do what she feels God is leading her to be:  a doctor.  A benefactor, one who doesn't believe God  has time for Belinda, finally is swayed by Belinda's outgoing attitude and offers to pay for Belinda's education in Boston.  Is Belinda ready to leave town and move to Boston?  How does Drew feel about her moving away?  Will she return to Anderson Corner?

These questions and others are answered in a powerful ending of the story.  This is a DVD unlike any other that I have seen recently.  For once, there are no town brawls and everyone gets along with everyone else.  There are little, if any, subplots to the story.  This is one that grabs the viewer's attention to see what Belinda will do to either stay the long journey of becoming a doctor or give in and live a life of wonderment as the wife of a cattle rancher in a small, country town.  You will be enriched by the story and come away a little more faithful that God does answer prayers.  Great praise for this story on DVD.

There are no special or bonus features.",1212883200,,2434,4.420224719101124

3117891,4,B0013LRKRQ,"There are now six films in the ""Love"" series, Love's Unfolding Dream being the only one to capture the power and passion of the original movie ""love Comes Softly"". In Love's Enduring Promise, there was a triangle romance. Grant Thomas, as everyone but Missy could see from the beginning, was a spoiled rich kid looking for a sophisticated Mrs. to complete his image, so there was nothing but to wait and see how Willie would end up stealing her heart. Another actress replaced January Jones as Missy in the next movie, Love's Long Journey. The chemistry between the lead actors was not the same, and attempts to restore romance by giving Jeff a girlfriend in Love's Abiding Joy still left something to be desired. Then a widowed Missy re-married in Love's Unending Legacy, but Zac is a bland character, despite being very handsom. Finally in the sixth film we have the same elements as in the first: two driven young people with integrity and strong minds, colliding as the winds of destiny toss their hearts together, changing, being changed . . . The whole series is good, but Softly and Unfolding are great.",1210982400,21,1110,4.756476683937824

Important characters are cut, children that belong to Marty are attached to Missy, and other important areas of the story are left out. The movies as a whole or in part are excellent family entertainment, but anyone that has read and reread the books needs to be prepared for a totally different series which only resembles the original book series.",1210377600,22,558,4.762886597938144

3352299,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Okay my wife and I fell hook line and sinker for the ""Love Comes Softly"" Series. No nudity, no extreme violence, no profanity and definitely a Christian influence inserted but not overbearing or a desire to convert you. We had collected from $2 to $4 locally, used, 1-5 and then #7 and one of the two prequels. We hit a dead end on #6 and #8 and the other prequel - so we're turning to Amazon to complete our series ""collection"" with those we don't have.

This sixth installment is done in the overall style and ""atmosphere"" as it's five predecessors. Missie's (Erin Cottrell) adopted daughter, Belinda, desires to become a doctor and is overall the main focus (and the setup for the seventh movie.) Belinda is portrayed extremely well by the beautiful and enthusiastic Scout Taylor-Compton. She starts with the local doctor whom grudgingly gives her a chance to work with a very wealthy and elderly female stroke victim from back east - Boston. And (par for the times) the doctor as well as others think a doctors job is one for the men only. Belinda also starts getting to assist the doctor and by the movie's end has earned his respect and endorsement to become a doctor.

The wealthy woman overcomes the effects of her stroke with Belinda's dedicated and persistent daily ""physical therapy"", so to speak. So much so that she becomes an admirer and supporter of Belinda's passionate desire to be a doctor. She graciously ""rewards"" Belinda with an offer to go to Boston and pay her entire tuition and expenses to become a doctor. Belinda's mother and grandmother and grandfather (Dale Midkiff - for the last time) all are here - yet you sense and can clearly see their roles becoming increasingly diminished. Then quite predictably the seventh movie becomes all about Belinda's, having become a doctor, initial efforts as a new practicing doctor (reviewed in the seventh movie section.)

If you've come this far in the series buy this sixth installment as well as #7. It's really not as good as the ones before it. The overall aura and feeling from the first five movies remains basically intact, though not as good as the first three. None the less - it's a very good, wholesome, entire family viewing production. The standard rugged western frontier setting (this is more set in town) and the male characters keeps it's male appeal basically intact; though lessened somewhat - it keeps it from being a ""chick flick."" It's female appeal is more visible and stands more to the front. Still a pretty good flick, stays basically on course with the series. The Mrs. and I both love it and give it a well deserved five stars.",1406764800,3,2623,4.722707423580786

In this movie, Belinda is all grown up and has dreams of being a doctor.  She wants to be tutored by the town doctor but he's against this.  Missie and the Sheriff are married now and he's good ol' Dad.  Perhaps I'm still bitter the writer's killed Willie off...But this is a sweet, wholesome movie in it's own right.

3352320,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Possibly one of my favorite movies. I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Love's Unfolding Dream was really quite clean. A man has a leg amputated not show on screen (although I think you see a little of the leg with the infection before hand) he also eventually dies; a young girl needs surgery, but nothing is shown. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.

I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry. So I only watch certain ones. Love Begins first (since is covers how the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream. They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.

Belinda dreams of a career in medicine, but the town doctor doesn't agree.  He thinks a woman should get married.  Her medical expertise (that she has learned through books since most medical collages won't accept women) is put to the test wehn she nurses a Boston socialite, Mrs. Stafford Smith, back to health after a stroke.  There tempers very often get the better of them, but Mrs. Smith eventually gets to know Belinda better and wants to help her achieve her dream and offers to pay for medical school.  Drew, an attorney who came to town to sell his deceased uncle's farm, changes his way of thinking about women and encourages Belinda in her dream.  As he falls in love with Belinda, she must decide if it's possible to be in love and follow your dreams. Meanwhile, Missy is enjoying her life with her new husband Zach, the town sheriff, and their two sons (Maddie, from her first marriage; and Jacob who is Belinda's brother).  She also insists on interfering with a neighboring family by teaching the mother how to read, by offering her a job helping out at the school.

Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",1372636800,,2314,4.583535108958838

3352345,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Whenever you see the words ""based on"" you know the film isn't going to follow the original story...as proves the case in this series.  I don't usually like films that are ""based on"" - particularly if I have loved the original stories - but I did enjoy this series directed by Michael Landon Jr. If you can accept these aren't the stories of the books written by Christian author Janette Oke, they are an enjoyable set of films of love & faith to watch in their own right. ""Love's Long Journey"" is my favourite in this series, but this film is a close second.

In this film:
Belinda Tyler has grown up and has a deep longing to be a doctor - a dream that is supported by her family. When Dr. Jackson advertises for an assistant, Belinda is there like a flash. Dr. Jackson believes women should be at home & isn't keen on having her work for him, but with faith & hard work, Belinda starts winning hearts who believe she should be in the profession. These include a wealthy dowager whom Belinda nurses back to full strength, Dr. Jackson himself, & visiting lawyer Drew Simpson. Belinda has always thought that to succeed as a doctor, her other dream for love would have to take second place. Only then Drew Simpson arrives to invade her heart. After his initial surprise at Belinda's choice of profession, he comes to see she is perfect for the job & supports her dream...now he just has to convince her that she can train to be a doctor and be married to him also!

3352358,5,B0013LRKRQ,"Love's Unfolding Dream is a wonderful film based on the books of Janette Oke, an excellent writer of solid and heartwarming stories. In Love's Unfolding Dream, Belinda, Missy's adopted daughter, dreams of one day becoming a doctor. Unfortunately Belinda lives in a time when women doctors were unheard of and shunned. Unfazed, Belinda still dreams of one day attending college and medical school and returning to her hometown as a doctor. She eventually becomes the unspoken assistant to the town's doctor while administering therapy to a wealthy and opinionated stroke victim, who we later find out has lived through much tragedy in her own life. Along the way, a handsome lawyer comes to town and makes Belinda question her dreams, aspirations, and God's plan for her life.

I read Janette Oke's books as a teenager and found them all to be wonderful. This series of films based on the books are just as wonderful and I would highly recommend the entire family-oriented series! You won't be disappointed!",1229990400,,1006,5.023952095808383

3352380,4,B0013LRKRQ,"""Love's Unfolding Dream"" is based on bestselling author Janet Oke's novel and is the sixth in the Love Comes Softly series.  It's a coming of age tale of Belinda Taylor (Scout Taylor-Compton), the will-of-her-own adopted daughter of a former heroine Missie Lahaye (Erin Cottrell).  Belinda is determined to live her own life and become a doctor in this story set in the era of buggies and stagecoaches.

With her mind made up and after reading as much as she can on medicine, Belinda approaches the town doctor, Doc Jackson (Robert Pine), and asks that he let her be his assistant.  He point blank tells her he doesn't need a nurse and that the medical profession is no place for a young lady who should be really thinking about finding a man, marrying him and staying home as the dutiful wife.  Belinda won't take no for an answer and Doc lets her assist him with his daily medical duties.

She's happy to assist and learn all she can from Doc until a stranger, Drew Simpson (Patrick Levis), shows up and tells her she should be happy to live life in the small town as a happily married wife of some lucky man.  Belinda is indignant that someone from New York City, a lawyer, would have the gall to tell her what she can and can't do.  Meanwhile, Drew is falling for Belinda as he works to refurbish the home left him when his relative passed away.

Belinda believes in the power of prayer and she wants to do what she feels God is leading her to be:  a doctor.  A benefactor, one who doesn't believe God  has time for Belinda, finally is swayed by Belinda's outgoing attitude and offers to pay for Belinda's education in Boston.  Is Belinda ready to leave town and move to Boston?  How does Drew feel about her moving away?  Will she return to Anderson Corner?

These questions and others are answered in a powerful ending of the story.  This is a DVD unlike any other that I have seen recently.  For once, there are no town brawls and everyone gets along with everyone else.  There are little, if any, subplots to the story.  This is one that grabs the viewer's attention to see what Belinda will do to either stay the long journey of becoming a doctor or give in and live a life of wonderment as the wife of a cattle rancher in a small, country town.  You will be enriched by the story and come away a little more faithful that God does answer prayers.  Great praise for this story on DVD.

There are no special or bonus features.",1212883200,,2434,4.420224719101124

This movie in particular deals with the ""traditional"" wife role vs. the more modern version and thought that it was handled quite well.  GO BELINDA!

3352388,4,B0013LRKRQ,"There are now six films in the ""Love"" series, Love's Unfolding Dream being the only one to capture the power and passion of the original movie ""love Comes Softly"". In Love's Enduring Promise, there was a triangle romance. Grant Thomas, as everyone but Missy could see from the beginning, was a spoiled rich kid looking for a sophisticated Mrs. to complete his image, so there was nothing but to wait and see how Willie would end up stealing her heart. Another actress replaced January Jones as Missy in the next movie, Love's Long Journey. The chemistry between the lead actors was not the same, and attempts to restore romance by giving Jeff a girlfriend in Love's Abiding Joy still left something to be desired. Then a widowed Missy re-married in Love's Unending Legacy, but Zac is a bland character, despite being very handsom. Finally in the sixth film we have the same elements as in the first: two driven young people with integrity and strong minds, colliding as the winds of destiny toss their hearts together, changing, being changed . . . The whole series is good, but Softly and Unfolding are great.",1210982400,21,1110,4.756476683937824

The only thing that bothers me is that there are so many discrepancies between the books and the movies. Important characters are cut, children that belong to Marty are attached to Missy, and other important areas of the story are left out. The movies as a whole or in part are excellent family entertainment, but anyone that has read and reread the books needs to be prepared for a totally different series which only resembles the original book series.",1210377600,22,558,4.762886597938144

It tells of the hardships that were endured by the families that were relocating to have a much better life during the hard times. It shows how a family who loved God endured both the good and not so good experiences and times throughout each generation that came along. You are drawn in to their lives and their homes as you watch each season. You cheer and laugh with them and you cry and are sad with them. You become a part of their adventure and lives.
