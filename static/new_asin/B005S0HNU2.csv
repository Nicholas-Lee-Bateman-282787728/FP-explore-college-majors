4861895,5,B005S0HNU2,"This series is perhaps the first in years that has held my interest. I am a huge fan of the Arthurian Legends. Even though it's very different than the original piece (as it should be), the writers/directors/actors have done a fantastic job in the retelling of an old and loved legend. I highly recommend it.",1331251200,7,308,4.618181818181818
4861896,5,B005S0HNU2,"Merlin Season 4 is the darkest one yet, & some of the characters we know will not live to see Season 5!

In the first 2 episodes of the season Morgana takes revenge on Merlin, Arthur & Camelot for killing Morgause by summoning the Callieach to tear open the veil between the worlds, the Dorocha, hellish creatures pour forth killing anyone whom they touch. With Uther a shadow of his former self, it falls to Arthur & his Knights to protect the Kingdom. It will take more than swords to vanquish their enemy this time & when Merlin finds out that it will entail someone making the Ultimate Sacrifice he is determined that this will be him fulfilling his destiny, but who will actually make the Ultimate Sacrifice? Arthur celebrates his birthday with Uther who is now in stronger spirits & they have a travelling circus that visits the castle but someone has come with them who wishes to do harm to Arthur, Uther comes to his son's rescue when tragedy strikes, can Merlin save Uther in time? Julius Borden arrives in Camelot looking for the 3rd part of the Triskellion key which lays in the vault under the castle which will lead him to the tomb of Ashkanar & the last Dragon's egg, will Merlin be able to use his powers as the Last Dragon Lord to protect Aithusa from harm. Arthur kills a rival King, Caerleon, in cold blood after the battle they have just fought but was it Arthur who wanted to do it or was it the pressure exerted on him by his uncle Lord Agravaine & what will Caerleon's widow Queen Annis do now.

Merlin is wounded in an ambush while travelling with Arthur to a secret meeting, Lord Agravaine takes him to Morgana who decides to implant a Formorroh serpent in his neck, which makes the victim have only one thing on their mind which is all consuming & in Merlin's case that thing is to kill Arthur at any cost, with some hilarious results, Merlin's alter ego Emrys has to come to the rescue. Following her defeat by Emrys, Morgana joins forces with the wizard Alator & kidnaps Gaius in an effort to find out more about her arch enemy Emrys. Merlin is sent to an outlying village to treat 3 men who are just shells of themselves after meeting someone or something that's lurking around their village, Lamia has a strange effect on Sir Leon, Sir Gwaine, Sir Percival & Sir Elyan, but what does she really want with them? Sir Lancelot suddenly reappears in the life of Guinevere on the day of a tournament to celebrate her betrothal to Arthur, but why has he returned now & what part does Morgana play in it? Will it cost Guinevere her marriage to Arthur or much more. (Be prepared with tissues for this episode). Arthur & his Knights are out on patrol when they find a shrine but don't know why it's been left there, Merlin has the distinct impression that something terrible happened & wants everyone to leave immediately, but Elyan is thirsty & takes a drink from the well, as a result he sees a spectral boy who demands that he kill Arthur in revenge for Uther ordering the murder of the Druids living there. When Arthur & Merlin pursue Elyan back to the shrine Arthur makes a shocking admission to Merlin. Arthur gets engaged to a neighbouring Princess as part of a treaty to unite their two Kingdoms, Princess Mithian is beautiful & Arthur finds himself falling in love with her, much to Merlin's annoyance. While out hunting Merlin is shocked at a reflection he sees running in a pool of water & is even more concerned when Mithian shoots a deer, but why & who did Merlin see in the water. Everything changes for Arthur when he finds a ring discarded on the forest floor & he calls off his engagement to Princess Mithian.

The season finale is great. Arthur finds out that Agravaine has been in league with Morgana & has given her the plans to get into Camelot with Helios & his Southron army. Arthur won't leave Camelot, so Merlin has to put a spell on him to make him leave, Arthur then follows every command Merlin gives with some comical results. Gaius, Gwaine & Elyan are left to try & hold back the invading army for as long as possible. Elyan is tortured with a Nathair serpent which will cause ""pain beyond all imagining"" & Gwaine has to fight for Morgana's pleasure to provide food for himself, Elyan & Gaius. Merlin & Arthur run into smugglers Tristan & Isolde, when the spell on Arthur wears off he & Merlin tell them who they really are & why they are on the run, Isolde is hurt in a fight & Merlin decides that the safest place for them to hide is Ealdor his home village where Arthur meets an old friend. When Agravaine finds them Merlin has to call Kilgharrah the Great Dragon to protect them while they flee for their lives. Agravaine chases them into the tunnels & Merlin tells Arthur to carry on without him while he creates a diversion, when Agravaine catches up with Merlin he finds out that he has the power of magic & that he is Emrys, but what price will he pay for his knowledge? Arthur has lost all his self confidence & is doubting his ability to be a great King for Camelot & indeed being able to bring peace to the five Kingdoms, Merlin has to persuade him that he is a great King & he will bring peace to all five Kingdoms, Merlin summons the Great Dragon Kilgharrah to ask his advise & afterwards he sees that the only way is for Arthur to remove the Sword from the Stone hidden deep in the forest of Ascetir, when Sir Leon, Sir Percival, other Knights & members of Camelot appear from their hiding places in the forest Arthur finds the strength of character to remove the Sword in the Stone to prove his destiny that he will a great King. Sir Leon & Sir Percival pledge that they would ""Ride into the Mouth of Hell"" for Arthur to retake Camelot. Arthur & his Knights with the help of Tristan & Isolde take back Camelot. What of Morgana? well we can only wait & see, finally what part will the Little White Dragon Aithusa play in the life of Morgana......

I enjoy how at each attempt Morgan tries to take the throne, she is thwarted and banished over and over again from Camelot. Love this show and am looking forward to watching the 5th and final season.",1438646400,,475,4.337078651685394

Many silly inconsistencies in the plots--using the magic to deal with some situations but not others, etc.-- but I don't care a bit. The acting is superb. They seem to write some episodes around the skills of their guest stars... to great result. Really enjoy the humor. The costumes are delicious. The hills and dales and mountains and forests are a treat. Nearing the end of Season 3 on hulu and was thrilled to find 4 and 5 on Amazon.",1418860800,,530,4.418367346938775

4861946,5,B005S0HNU2,I discovered Merlin after it had been on for awhile and hated that it ended.  Colin Morgan is a wonderful actor and the rest of the cast compliment his character. The concept is great and I don't understand why it ended so soon when so many tedious series go on and on.  I have tried other suggestions for series that have the same theme but none compare.  If anyone has suggestions I would really appreciate them.  Thanks,1395446400,,422,4.441558441558442

The show abounds with colorful characters brought to life by a talented cast of actors, and the special effects are decent. The plot is full of mysterious twists and intrigue, whatever your level of familiarity is with the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.

4861965,5,B005S0HNU2,"One of the best shows I've ever seen. The characters are classic and the show stays true to the legendary characters while the actors make each of them into their own unique personalities. They evolve and grow from episode to episode, season to season, increasing their depth and complexity, and it's amazing to me how the writers and actors accomplish this. Another essential ingredient contributing to my enjoyment is the humor. I believe it is the most important component to the show's longevity. It balances the darkness inherent to the legendary magic and warfare while also deepening interest and audience investment in the individual characters. I'm looking forward to the sixth season and wondering what will happen to the dragons. As ancient and superintelligent as they are, even they evolve, grow and age. The scenery and effects are amazing and appropriate to the story - not phony or over-the-top. The entire production is top notch because it draws you into the world to experience the whole epic story.",1385683200,,1018,5.065476190476191

4861969,5,B005S0HNU2,"Anyone who loves Arthurian history/lore will love this! It's a different angle than what one is used to, but really is quite believable, as 6th century Britain was filled with sorcery & territorial wars.",1380672000,,203,5.0

4861978,5,B005S0HNU2,I can't say enough positive about this series.  I'm so taken with these young actors and how they've grown through this five years.

4861980,5,B005S0HNU2,"Being a 'Die Hard' Merlin fan has been Thrilling!!!  The casting is a job well done; Colin Morgan was the perfect Merlin.  To me, the sad part is the fact that Merlin's identity has been kept a secret.  By the fouth season, King Arthur and Merlin should have been friends and working together.  Exciting adventures and quests could have been woven into the story line pitting Good against Evil.  A lot of the mystic and connections to the unknown seemed to be missing.  Merlin had great powers that were not taken into consideration in the story line, but it was still a great season and a must for viewing public.",1376265600,,614,4.536363636363636

So what... she's cute!",1375660800,,343,5.37037037037037

4861994,3,B005S0HNU2,"I would never give MERLIN less than a 5 star rating (haven't yet until today), but the quality of the entire Season 4 DVD pack has changed this.  Freezing up on every disc in the package.  Sound of voices doesn't match the actors movements in their mouths, skips 2-30 seconds into the next scenes.  This constantly happens throughout the entire disc.  All the discs in this package I received do this.  I have returned this item.  I'm going to get another Series 4 and pray I can give MERLIN the 5 star review  it deserves.  As far as the show itself, Merlin is 5 stars hands down.  Episodes 1 and 2 are brilliant.  Episode 3 is the moment all us Merlin fans have been waiting for. Bradley James and Colin Morgan were exceptional.  Episode 4 is for all you dragon lovers.  Episode 9 is for all you Lancelot lovers.  Episode 13 (finale')is the best of the series.  Colin is at his peak when it comes to acting and Bradley adds so much to this show.",1371945600,,947,4.337142857142857
4861995,4,B005S0HNU2,"I loved the beginning of this series and continue to follow it because I am invested in the characters.  I bought this DVD set but didn't bother watching the series as it aired because I find absolute evil to be boring.  Yes, I am still rooting for the good guys, but there is no mystery or suspense in terms of wondering who the bad guy is.  The series presents lots of grey areas of life with Arthur and his beliefs, but Morgana and company have been stereotyped into one-dimensional caricatures:  Gee, I wonder what Morgana will do next.  Something evil?  Wow, I never saw that coming.  It's still a good series but, for me, it falls short of great.",1371600000,,652,4.428571428571429

4861999,5,B005S0HNU2,Scenery is incredible in Wales and France.  You can see that the moment it starts.  The actors/actresses are more than what they seem when in costume.  It is refreshing to get lost in a series and then have a week to look forward to the next episode.  Only the BBC can do that as they have shown us year after year.,1370563200,,315,4.114754098360656

4862010,5,B005S0HNU2,"This is my all-time favorite show and I just can't get enough of it. The fourth season is possibly my favorite of all of them because of many reasons: Arthur shows how much he needs Merlin in several different occasions, Morgana's hunt for Emrys is so ironic that I can't help but laugh sometimes, there's a baby dragon, Arthur and Gwen are adorable, and of course Merlin's powers are as epic as usual.

I enjoy the actors and think they were well cast for their parts.
I like this period in time and the King Arthur stories.  I have seen most all stories with Merlin as a main character but never have seen one where he is a boy and youth. Most all of the previous stories have shown him as an ageing wizard.  This series was in my opinion well done and different than the usual tale. This series may have wandered off from the myth that has been handed down in some parts but the show was well done.
There was also a lot of humor interjected throughout the series. If you enjoy this time period and wizards and such it is likely you will enjoy Merlin.",1366934400,,684,4.174242424242424

4862020,5,B005S0HNU2,"Say what you will about the creators of this series rewriting the legend to fit in with a 21st Century audience. I have been looking for a heart-felt, gut wrenching Bromance since Starsky and Hutch went off the air in 1979. I've loved Bromances since I was a child, don't ask me why, but men caring for each other is an attraction I cannot pass up. Though Arthur treats Merlin like the 'fool' he pretends to be in order to keep suspicion away from his use of magic, in the end of series 4, their bond is growing stronger and stronger. Merlin is finally seeing a way to step through the door and become Arthur's 'advisor' and... Arthur finally sees the truth in Merlin's words,as showcased in the final two parter ""The Sword In The Stone"" arc. There is hope here, lots of it, especially in regards to their trusting each other and being positively protective of each other. The other stories in this series are supplemental and used to drive this central relationship to its heartbreaking conclusion. Colin and Bradley's performances shine and they are an incredible team. A most satisfied veiwer, here. Bring on the Bromance and you've got a fan for the duration!",1365552000,,1163,4.650485436893204

Don't be thinking you are going to see ""The Crystal Cave"" or ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" or any of the classic takes on the tales of Arthur and the knights of the round table.  Arthur is a goofy, stuck up kid, who's just trying to be kingly.  He's a noble and great knight, but still trying to get his feet under himself as the king of Camelot.  He makes mistakes, but he also learns from them.  Merlin still has to keep secret the fact that he ""has magic"".  His battles with Morganna are steller!",1364428800,,664,4.165354330708661

4862028,5,B005S0HNU2,"In Season 4 of a projected 5-Season story-arc much of what we have heard about the legend of Arthur is touched upon. (It has already been announced that the show ends with Season 5.) Uther dies, Arthur is crowned king, Lancelot has a tryst with Gweneviere betraying Arthur, Arthur marrys her anyway, and the season ends with the Sword in the Stone. It is one thing to know that TV and Movies are rarely shot in sequence but it is quite another to know that Camelot is located in a backlot at Cardiff Studios in Wales and Arthur's Castle is located in Brittany, France where scenes for an entire Season of programs is shot in one session lasting weeks. As often happens as the popularity of a show increases so does its budget and the complexity of the CGI effects used to create it. The backbone of the program remains the by-play between Merlin and Arthur both now in their mid-twenties. The fact that they are made peers allows us to see them grow and mature together in their relationship with one another and in their mastery of the duties allotted them. The show retains the light-hearted banter that has characterized it from the beginning and touches on the more serious aspects of the story without getting heavy. It remains a family oriented program.",1364256000,,1259,4.625

4862033,5,B005S0HNU2,"I don't know when I became a Merlin fan because I was a King Arthur fan before. I only liked the first season a little bit. I tend to like my history... or mythology... to be in line with early records, but this is NOT the Once and Future King. It's about Merlin and I think that is actually what makes it work. With each season, we see both Arthur and Merlin grow into men, but Merlin definitely outstrips Arthur in wisdom. Merlin is the wind beneath Arthur's wings. And he has to be to live up to his place in mythology.

If you asked me how a story with magic, dragons, juvenile pranks, knights, and fights could appeal to both tweens and adults, I'd have said it wasn't possible. Merlin does it. Everything blends together so well. It's become one of my favorites. So much so that I didn't even mind when they made an INCREDIBLE diversion from the original storyline in this season. Ah, well.

I love to watch shows & movies from that period. It takes you to a whole different time period & you can escape the awful things that are happening in this time period. Especially the attack on the middle class people in this time period. I recommend Merlin highly especially if you like magic.

4862056,5,B005S0HNU2,I cannot get enough of this series.  I was going to go slow watching the episodes to make it last...NOPE could not do it!  before you know it an episode is done.  the magic is more -- love that!  the characters are developing so well!  what a great spin on this story that I never grow tired of!,1361577600,,295,4.017241379310345
4862057,5,B005S0HNU2,"'Merlin' follows the life of a young warlock, the legendary Merlin, before he becomes the bearded advisor to King Arthur. Merlin, instead of being a wizened old man, begins the series as a happy, optimistic young man. The opening scene has this wide-eyed country boy entering Camelot, a place where he could be executed just for the simple reason of having magic. His first meeting with Prince Arthur is surprising and hilarious.  After saving Arthur's life, King Uther rewards Merlin by making him a manservant to Prince, and now King, Arthur. Colin Morgan's (Merlin) and Bradley James (Arthur) have a great chemistry together and are the sole reason that Merlin and Arthur have such an epic bromance. Merlin and Arthur's banter and rapport with each other is amazing and entertaining.

The show kind of picks and chooses parts of the legends and pieces them together however the writers choose. Some Arhturian legend people probably think the show is blasphemous, but I think it is pure genius. Right away, the humor embedded in the show drew me in. I love sarcasm and banter. Then, this season, 'Merlin' began to show a depth it did not previously possess. The fourth season starts out strong, establishing Arthur as the ruler of Camelot, and after his father's surprising death in episode the three ""The Wicked Day"", as king. Each episode this season has more of a weight on it. You can feel how much work Merlin still has to do the create Albion and how Arthur feels like he won't live up to his father's reign. The show, I guess most reviewers are saying, has become more dark and mature.

This season, like all shows, had its highs and lows for episode quality, but altogether, this show is amazing. My favorite episode is ""A Servant of Two Masters,"" Who knew that Merlin being cursed to become Arthur's assassain could be so hilarious? One episode that I did like, but I didn't think went with the story arc they had begun at the beginning of the season was the ninth episode, which is where Lancelot makes an appearance to help complete the Arthurian Love Triangle of Gwen, Arthur and Lancelot. I felt like they were only putting it in there for legends sake. If they were going to do that, they should have done it when Lancelot was still alive and done that story line justice. I wish they would have stayed more focused on Morgana's search for Emrys and Arthur's journey to accepting magic.

Honestly, I mostly watch the show because I love the characters, and therefore, I have come to love the actors. Colin Morgan, Bradley James, Katie McGrath, and Angel Coulby simply shine this season, especially Colin and Bradley. They both have to pull off a lot of emotional scenes, which they nail, but they both also possess great comedic timing. All of there scenes together (and apart) are just wonderful. Gwen's charactor gets more involved with court politics this season, letting Angel really sink her teeth into the role, allowing her to show more dimension to Gwen's charactor.

So, yes, simply put: Merlin is definitely worth watching...over and over again. Plus, with this box set, you get the amazing extras, which you can't get off of Netflix, so I think everyone should own the DVDs or Blurays.",1361491200,,3212,4.76978417266187

4862064,5,B005S0HNU2,"I love the Arthur legend.  Even though there are changes with the legend, in this series, the forth season is just as great and entertaining as the other 3 seasons.  The characters have been fully developed so things can move along  without having to establish what kind of person he or she is.  I love the magic and hopefully, they will, sometime, have Arthur find out about Merlin's great powers and except it, so there can be more magic in the show.  The big dragon is still around, and there is a new baby dragon.  I recommend this series to people who like the Arthur legend, or just like fantasy.",1361059200,,602,4.427272727272728

Wish all the previous series had Blu-ray at the time I purchased them  I saw the final series on line from England. As of this review it's showing on SyFy. This final series comes out on Blu-ray in April thru Amizon. You must get it The acting of these three young actors is truly great. Colin will make you cry in the last episode. It is very very touching. Nice to see Colin Morgan win the NTA award for best dramtic actor. I met Colin last July at Comic-con. Was lucky to talk to him one on one. What a great young man he is. Told him he is a teriffic actor and he thanked me. This series is very good and the next final series is exceptional. It's great entertainment for the whole family. Not many TV shows today are.

My only complaint would be that there were not as many special features as previous seasons had. I really missed the episode by episode 15 minute behind the scenes ""The Magic of Merlin"" like previous seasons had, and the video of them at San Diego ComicCon.

I love the banter between Merlin and King Arthur.  The acting is great and the stories are very well written.  It is a clean program that children can watch. It is refreshing to see a program where you don't have to deal with foul language and sex.

Every episode is full of magic and whimsy.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the last good season of the show, since the fifth and final one put a very depressing spin on it and lost all of the fun wit that made the show so enjoyable to watch.

What keeps me watching is the cast and Merlin & Author's relationship and funny banter. Each season really raises the expectations and doesn't disappoint. Merlin seemed like a hidden gem on BBC1 and now I've gotten several friends & family members Addicted. Season 4 is the most complex, dark & magical. It draws you in and envelopes you into Merlin's world where he is always growing and encountering daily struggles and destiny's dilemma. I'm such a Morgana fan. Wow she can change her hair at 4-6 times in an episode. Amazing. Because it's done by BBC1 earlier seasons are hard to come by & Syfy reruns are rare. Some have found season 4 on youtube. My comcast on-demand seems to dump the last season pretty quickly not like CSI, Mentalist & NCIS which run marathons daily forever.

4862100,5,B005S0HNU2,"I should mention I have only seen the first four seasons of this show (apparently the fifth and final season just finished airing) and that is what I'll refer to. Most all ""spoilers"" aren't really spoilers considering the age of the Arthurian myth but I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum anyway.

I'm going to start this review with a synopsis of something completely unrelated: a Disney version movie about the Alamo featuring Davy Crockett, Sam Huston and a number of such cowboys that some might say have now passed into legend was released almost ten years ago. I watched it on one of the movie channels and I just remember being so disappointed with it on so many levels. Where I was expecting and hoping for something with more the fun tone of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" I got more of historical almost documentary that seemed to go out it's way to delusional me with with facts and realities about the different characters around the events of ""The Alamo"". In short, just wasn't that fun to watch and was a very forgettable movie.

I mention that because this show takes a legend/myth, perhaps not exactly the same level of myth/legend, and does it right. In fact this show is the reason I enjoy British shows so much more than American stuff.

The thing is I don't know why I like it so much. The production values are extremely low. The effects are hokey. I have no kids and I'm in my mid-30s. I really have no excuse for watching and/or enjoying this show. And yet there's something about it I just have to keep watching it. And when I say the production values are low I mean they're really low. As in the prop shields actually LOOK cardboard. They don't even reflect light as if they're some sort of metal. Same for the swords. It's almost as if the production values are low on purpose like the early seasons of South Park.

And maybe you could say the writing makes up for this. Well some episodes are actually pretty good and at the same time have rather gaping plot holes. The palace guards may as well not exist they're so easily over-come or knocked out.

I think what sets this show apart is that it although if you just watched a short clip of it you could tempted to dismiss it as a kid's show at the same time there's a lot of serious issues that are tackled and a lot of grey areas explored. And what really sets it apart from any American kid's production is death. Characters, some times major characters, actually die. There's never any actual blood (it's not game of thrones after all) but people do die. In fact the first episode of the series features several magic practitioners being burned at the stake. Not shown in any detail of course, just people tied up and fires being started, towns people looking away.

So it's not a realistic show depicting life of the dark ages or realistic combat (what combat there is always shown in exaggerated slow motion) or what you'd really have to do to survive in the wilderness. In that way it may as well be an animated show. And yet it's not so sanitized as to never ever cope with death, loss, betrayal, or tough decisions.

I thought they actually did a good job with the character arcs. Arthur and Morgana for instance: In that first season I would not have thought it possible Morgana would turn into this evil villain she eventually becomes. And Merlin gains more and more ability so gradually I hardly noticed it happening. I wasn't expecting Merlin's elderly alter-ego to become a regular thing either. By the end of the forth season it was just seemed like it fit perfectly. Some famously named knights, Lancelot for instance, make appearances early on but leave upon realizing Camelot isn't ready for them. In one episode they even find a long abandoned castle with round table in it. And over several episodes in different seasons Merlin manages to work in the sword in the stone part of the legend.

There's also some solid values included through out about doing the right thing, taking responsibility your own actions, forgiving when necessary...everything you would expect the King Arthur of legend to represent in other words. Let me emphasize it is not in any way preachy. These are about as universally accepted values as you can find.

In summary this exactly what I would hope and want a TV production about the Arthurian myth would be: a group of noble knights, lead by King Arthur, fighting for their kingdom and holding up what's truly right against all evil. Doesn't get bogged down in the logistics of how that army is being supplied or how that army covered that distance all the way to within sight of the main castle without anyone in the kingdom noticing. That's thinking about it too hard. Just enjoy it for it is I guess I'm saying.",1357344000,,4748,4.569917743830787

It feels like at this point now, they are trying to reinvent the wheel so much, that the legend everyone is so familiar with, now seems stale and less magical.

If they just side a little more towards the original legend or write some better material, I don't see the show progressing well.

King Arthur becomes the king he wants to be.  It is such a great family series.  The humor is wonderful, the friendship between Guis and Merlin is wonderful and very satisfying.  The language is of a higher caliber than any of the American sitcoms.  There may be a ""hell"" or ""idiot"" used occasionally but that is the strongest language.  The knights are very noble.  It is a series that is thrilling from season 1, the characters are strong throughout and each season becomes more and more compelling.

Merlin's and Arthur's story continues. This season has many dark, but also many happy parts. As Merlin begins to mature he begins to be less naive and more  paranoid. His faith is Arthur as the one true king is strengthened, but as Merlin begins to gain confidence in himself he begins to make him misinterpret many things.

This season was well done, but I felt at times a bit drier than previous seasons. Yet it all seemed to have purpose. More than a few times I began to wonder if Merlin would reveal himself soon as he became more heedless with his magic in public. During certain parts I was surprised by Merlin's general attitude and what seems like (but I am not quite sure if it is) deep anger that seems to be growing inside of him.

4862126,4,B005S0HNU2,"This is going to a rather odd review considering that season four of ""Merlin"" has the very best and worst that the show has to offer. On the one hand, it has some of the most sophisticated storylines, the highest production values and the strongest performances from its young cast that have thus far featured on the show. There is also far less filler (a great improvement on the last season, which seemed to be composed almost entirely of padding) and greater care taken with continuity and overarching plot-threads. On the other hand, it still suffers from the usual problems: a lack of meaningful character development, the irritating marginalization of its two female characters, and its stubborn refusal to let Merlin finally reveal his magical abilities to Arthur.

To recap this review in a nutshell: the first half of this season is the best that ""Merlin"" has ever been - but the second half falls apart, leading to an entirely lackluster finale. If you're not in the mood to read any further, consider that my conclusive statement on series four.

But&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/last-season/dp/B004LROMQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">last season</a>&nbsp;ended on a high note what with Prince Arthur assembling his most trusted knights and winning back Camelot from his half-sister's control. With Morgana defeated and King Uther in a state of deep depression over his daughter's betrayal, series four opens a year later with Arthur in firm control of the kingdom. In this he's helped by a new arrival: his uncle Agravaine, who establishes himself as the young prince's closest advisor.

Obviously, things are not going to be smooth-sailing for long. Morgana is determined to take her revenge on Camelot, and having grown in magical powers and established a spy in Camelot to feed her information (as well as donning a new all-black wardrobe), she certainly feels like a more dangerous adversary than she did last year. Yet soon she becomes paranoid by a series of warnings about a figure known as Emrys, a powerful sorcerer who is destined to be her doom. As she begins her obsessive search for him, she remains unaware that he is none other than Merlin himself.

In some semblance of order, here are my thoughts on the good and bad aspects of series four: (spoilers will be marked).

ACTING: As always, the cast is top-notch, and manage to infuse some rather dodgy writing with genuine emotion and resonance. Its four young cast members in particular are given some really juicy scenes this time around, and are all exceptional at conveying heartbreak, terror, joy, relief and steely determination on command. The writers of ""Merlin"" are damn lucky that they've got Colin Morgan, Bradley James, Angel Coulby and Katie McGrath on board, as their charisma does wonders at plastering over some of the gaping plot-holes that the writers leave in their scripts.

Backing them up are a range of British thespians, not only Anthony Stewart Head, John Hurt, Richard Wilson and Nathanial Parker as series regulars, but a bevy of big-name stars that pop in for guest spots: Gemma Jones, James Callis, Lindsay Duncan, Gary Lewis, Terence Maynard, Ben Daniels, Miranda Raison - granted, these names may not mean much to the average viewer, but once you see their faces on-screen I guarantee that you'll be nodding your head and saying: ""oh yeah...I know them..."" This season also has plenty of eye-candy on display with the new knights of Camelot, all played by actors who could have quite easily pursued a career in modeling, and who enjoy walking around in various states of undress.

TOP-NOTCH PRODUCTION VALUES: With an upgrade to 35mm film and the acquisition of a huge green-screen, ""Merlin"" now looks good enough for the movie theatre. The sets are bigger, the camera-work is smoother, the CGI is more convincing, the makeup/costumes are as lovely as ever, and there's an altogether ""bigger"" feel to the scale of the show.

DARKER THEMES: ""Merlin"" feels a lot more grown-up this time around. Major characters die and stay dead, forcing those left behind to come to terms with their absence. Likewise, there's mercifully less pushing of the reset button: this season things change, and change for good in Camelot. Having treaded water for so many years, the writers are finally taking some significant steps toward the Golden Age that Arthur is prophesied to usher in.

I also don't recall any fart gags this time around, but though there's still plenty of lame slapstick humor, there are also some of the most dramatic scenes seen yet on the show. Colin is asked to cry practically every episode and manages to do so in a way that will break your heart each time, and Bradley and Angel share a scene that apparently ended with them getting a round of applause from the crew - you'll know it when you see it. Furthermore, Katie now portrays a much more nuanced Morgana, and the smirk that typified her performance last year has been considerably toned down.

EPISODES ONE TO SEVEN: For the first time, the ""Merlin"" writers move away from self-contained episodes in order to tell a story that spans several episodes, with events happening in each that directly affects what happens in the next. In a show in which the villains are responsible for driving most of the action, it was a wise decision to give Morgana a clear, singular goal (the search for Emrys) thus leaving Agravaine to stir up trouble in Camelot. The overarching story begins to rise to a climax as Morgana closes in on Merlin's secret, Agravaine tries to incriminate someone else for his role as the traitor in Camelot, Arthur and Guinevere make significant steps forward in becoming the future King and Queen, and Merlin learns more about his heritage as a Dragonlord, as well as his alter-ego 'Emrys'.

SPOILERS BELOW...

EPISODES EIGHT TO THIRTEEN: It's not that the remaining six episodes are *bad*, it's simply that they have nothing whatsoever to do with the previous seven. It's almost as though the writers abruptly changed their minds about what this season was going to be about and rewrote the ending as a muddle of unrelated stories that deal with the Arthurian Love Triangle (well acted, but badly handled), two filler episodes (concerning yet another evil villainess and a Druid-ghost), a 45-minute prologue to the finale (Agravaine and Morgana plot whilst Arthur fluffs about with a random princess) and the two-part finale itself - which really is a disappointment compared to the excitement and emotional resonance of the show's past season finales: ""Le Mort d'Arthur"", ""The Last Dragonlord"" and ""The Coming of Arthur.""

The ending reflects badly on the season's strong beginning, simply because it highlights all the lost opportunities and leaves so many dangling plot-threads. Morgana's search for Emrys gave her new focus and storylines - it goes nowhere after episode seven. The Arthurian Love Triangle was suitably emotional and heartbreaking - instead of resolving it, it's just sweep under the rug. The ""traitor in our midst"" story-arc - dropped entirely. Morgana takes over Camelot with ease and Arthur wins it back just as effortlessly - a blatant retreat of last season's finale.

A chance to see the knights as individuals, learning and growing and bonding together - they're just an interchangeable red-cloaked hoard. Guinevere's rise to power - ignored after her first confrontation with Agravaine in favor of shaming and humiliating her, and then not even bothering to exonerate her good name. Agravaine - hogs way too much screen-time and remains a cypher throughout (without relying on guess-work, can anyone explain to me where he came from, what his motivation was, or what kind of power he planned to get from Morgana that he didn't already have with Arthur?) Arthur - still completely oblivious to pretty much everything that goes on around him.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Callis/dp/B0036EH3U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Callis</a>&nbsp;as an intriguing villain - wasted. Tristan and Isolde - pointless. Merlin and Gwaine's friendship - non-existent. That goes ditto for Guinevere and Elyan - they're meant to be siblings, but you wouldn't know it from watching any of these episodes. Lancelot - an ignoble and disappointing end for such an iconic character. Percival - we still don't know a thing about him beyond the fact that he has nice arms.

And the long-awaited magical reveal...? Not this season.

To put it briefly, this show is great at set-up, but usually disappoints when it's pay-off time. The writers often introduce new plot-points only to lose interest in them; as such it's difficult to really invest in anything when you can't be sure that it'll get resolved in any meaningful way. Furthermore, the show is so plot-heavy (racing from one ""big moment"" to the next) that there's no breathing room to explore the characters. When there *is* a quiet moment, it's usually repetitive or filled with exposition. Most of the time the characters exist in service to the plot and not the other way around, leading them to change dramatically from episode to episode - they are only as smart, effective and/or observant as the plot requires them to be (and when the plot *doesn't* require them to be these things, they end up looking immensely stupid).

So despite the welcome shaking up of the status-quo this year, season four of ""Merlin"" is a mixed bag, and there's still a long way to go in bringing the main characters to a satisfying conclusion in what is rumored to be the fifth and final season. Were I able to, I would rank this season three-and-half-stars; I went with four rather than three simply because I still enjoy this show as fluffy, relatively mindless entertainment. It's just that I'm constantly aware of just how much better it could be with sharper, braver writing that isn't afraid to explore the characters and let their stories grow organically.",1331596800,63,9990,5.07739183424741
