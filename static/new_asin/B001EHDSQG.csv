3555041,5,B001EHDSQG,"I've always liked this show and my only complaint would be that it is a ""best of"" series instead of a complete season.  It turned out I already had the episodes on various compilations, so I got nothing new.  I also got best of seasons 2 and 3 at the same time, but have not had time to watch them yet.  Once I started on season 1, it was hard to not finish a disc.  I ended up watching both discs on the same day as it reminded me how much I miss this series.",1348444800,5,460,3.8105263157894735
3555042,5,B001EHDSQG,"I really enjoy watching and quoting Jimmy Neutron's words from time to time, to get a good laugh. I am a cartoon person but I really only like good cartoons.  Jimmy doesn't have the violence that is through todays cartoons.  Though sometimes I'd like to smack his Dad...if you watch this you'll know why...lol",1267574400,,309,4.703703703703703
3555043,1,B001EHDSQG,"Sorry,this is a great show and I would have enjoyed it,if the DVD's worked. For some unknown reason these discs do not play on any of MY DVD players and I tried several including my PC.Amazon was great about sending me new copies but unfortunately these didn't work either. I also had the same problem with Best of Seasons 2 & 3. I wouldn't recommend buying these until the manufacturer solves this problem. I've also bought other Nickleodeon DVD's,Hey Arnold Seasons 1 & 2,The Rugrats Seasons 1& 2,The FairlyOddparents Season 1 and The Mighty B,all these work fine! I do Thank Amazon though,I won't let this bad experience deter me from purchasing other items in the future! R.Dube.",1260921600,3,683,4.796610169491525

Jimmy Neutron is a boy genius, and fulfills every boy's dream of building his own space-ship, as well as a jet-pack, hovercraft, submarine, and a list of neat inventions, like a shrinking-ray-gun.

Jimmy's parents and school friends all have unique personalities. Character-acting in cartoons. Lots of clever humor. Always a story.

Lots of adventures in town and in outer-space, sometimes with villains. Fast-pace. High quality art, detail, and effort in every way.

16-episodes per-season. All three seasons are good.

There are cheaper ways to see if you like Jimmy Neutron.

""Jet Fusion"" $3, a different episode, and 6 episodes found within seasons-1-3.
""Attack of Twonkies"" $4, a different episode, and 3 episodes found in seasons 1-3.
""Sea of Trouble"" is $5, 6-episodes all found within seasons 1-3.

Available to rent at your local Blockbuster.

An extreme example of humor targeted to adults: Jimmy uses a time-machine to bring Thomas Edison for his school, presentation. The school principal has an argument with Edison, and says, ""... and call me Tesla"", which relies on the viewer knowing Thomas Edison had a bitter rivalry with Nicolai Tesla. Tesla invented DC-current and won the contract for the world's fair over Edison's AC-current.

I also recommend the animated films of imagination and story: ""Incredibles"", ""Iron Giant"", ""Max Fleischer's Gulliver's Travels"", ""Great Mouse Detective"", ""Antz"", ""Secret of Nimh"".",1260835200,7,1620,5.379446640316205

This is a very good Jimmy Neutron DVD Collection.
-First, about Jimmy Neutron, in case you don't know: Jimmy is a Boy Genius, a cartoon from Nickelodeon. He invents all kinds of wonderful devices; from a simple Hovercar, to a Shrink Ray to Books On Gum (Something Amazon should explore.) Adventures and silliness always follow! Jimmy is often accompanied by his best friends, Sheen and Carl; his robotic pet dog, Goddard; and two girls named Cindy and Libby. The animation is simply superb; three dimensional computer graphics with astonishing attention to detail, reflections, shadows, mirrors, and moving backgrounds. It's not Pixar, but it sure isn't the Fairly Oddparents either. Better still, every episode is at least very funny, and at most fall-on-the-floor hilarious.
-The Collection is very good. Though I know many Neutron fans were disappointed Nick didn't just release the entire series. Some Jimmy is better than no Jimmy though. Still, for Season One, almost everything available in this collection has already been released on DVD before.
-What's more, there are no DVD special add-ons at all, which is disappointing. No behind-the-scenes, storyboards, commentary, or anything. Just the shows. It also should be noted that in the first season, an average show was only about fifteen minutes long. The following seasons Jimmy started having many more adventures that lasted a full half hour. It ALSO should be noted that the DVDs are formatted DVD-R so they will probably not work on older DVD players.
-But the shows are definitely worth having. And this collection is worth having for The Eggpire Strikes Back alone, a brilliant mini-movie.

The selections from Season One are:
Disc 1:
Brobot
The Big Pinch
Normal Boy
Birth of Salesman
Raise the Oozy Scab
I Dream of Jimmy
The Egg-Pire Strikes Back (A Mini-Movie.)

Disc 2:
Broadcast Blues
Professor Calimitous, I Presume
Hall Monster
Hypno-Birthday to You
The Phantom of Retroland
My Son, the Hamster
Granny Baby
Time is Money
Krunch Time
Substitute Creature",1224288000,41,2070,5.173134328358209

3555051,1,B001EHDSQG,"Why can't they just release the complete season? I have not, and refuse to purchase this or any other season of Jimmy Neutron from Amazon until they fix this and release full and complete season sets. These 'Best of' sets are just a joke! They have fixed this issue with Rugrats and several other shows, and as a result, I bought all of them. If they can fix Jimmy Neutron so that it is released as complete season sets, I'll buy every single one, and I'm sure other people will as well.

Amazon (or whomever else it may concern), PLEASE fix this! Same goes with Kenan and Kel and any other shows that still have 'Best of' sets still for sale. Nobody wants those!
