6304243,5,B00IXPWGIS,"Back in 1975, when anything resembling a new Western was as rare as rocking horse manure, I thrilled at the advertisements for the new CBS series BARBARY COAST. ""At last,"" I thought, ""a good, old-fashioned Western.""

Well, not quite. BARBARY COAST wasn't Rawhide or Gunsmoke, set during a cattle drive on the open prairie or in a frontier town where one good man represented law and order. No, BARBARY COAST was a different kind of Western. In fact, it is hard to think of it as a Western at all, even though it is set in 1870, five years after the end of the American Civil War. Nonetheless, it was an earnest attempt to breathe new life into the Western genre at a time when audiences seemed more interested in car chases and cop shows. Heck, even that perennial favourite, the above-mentioned TV series Gunsmoke, ended its 20 year run in 1975.

Located in San Francisco, the real Barbary Coast was a red light district in the second half of the 19th-Century and early 20th-Century. Approximately nine blocks in size, the area was filled to the brim with brothels, dance halls and saloons. The Coast was notable for its lawlessness, gambling, vigilantism and prostitution. With a population explosion in San Francisco from just under 500 in 1847 (pre-Gold Rush) to over 25,000 in 1849 when the California Gold Rush began, the Coast became synonymous with the worst of the Wild West: corruption, crime and killing. Sounds a bit like the recent show Deadwood, doesn't it?

Back in 1975, television couldn't entertain the notion of an accurate representation of the seediness and filth of the real Barbary Coast. It could, however, provide the perfect historical setting for an action-packed series about a lawman (in this case, a government agent played by William Shatner) to go after the bad guys, who, like the real-life early days of the Barbary Coast, were never in short supply.

The question was, how to balance the decadence of the historical Barbary Coast with the restrictions of '70s television?

The answer? Make BARBARY COAST appeal to kids. While the show has enough action and cleverness to pass as an entertainment for adults (particularly those who remember it from a simpler time), I am convinced that BARBARY COAST was primarily designed for young people. When one understands this, it becomes possible to see past the lack of blood, the occasional plot holes and the over-lit, '70s style of television filmmaking that included the liberal use of painted back drops and much too clean costumes.

Based on this understanding, BARBARY COAST is an excellent series that really didn't get a fair chance to find its legs, probably because it was too much like a Western, which, it has been pointed out, was an unpopular genre at the time. Another aspect of the show, which in hindsight is arguably a strength, was that it wasn't quite sure if it wanted to be a Western, a comedy, or a Mission Impossible-type drama. Hence it comes across as a sort of hybrid. There are enough elements of each to ensure a modest degree of originality, but it probably struck audiences at the time as being not enough of one thing and too much of another.

The pilot movie established the setting, replete with disgustingly muddy streets which are emphasized here and throughout the series in the opening and closing credits. William Shatner, as government agent Jeff Cable, is immediately shown to be a master of disguise, though not until a little later is it clear to the viewer that it is Shatner. He uses his facility with makeup and costumed characterization to infiltrate and annihilate the bad guys who frequent the Coast. This role suits Shatner like a glove and is the main reason the show appeals, at least to Shatner fans. The early 1970s were not a good time for William Shatner. Star Trek had been cancelled and left him typecast and out of work. Roles were so sporadic that he lost his home and had to live in a truck bed camper in the San Fernando Valley. Occasional TV guest spots and a lot of commercials, combined with personal appearances at small parties (yes, it got THAT bad) made this the low point of Shatner's career (with one notable exception, his SUPERB performance in the television adaptation of the Broadway play The Andersonville Trial, directed by George C. Scott, but that's another story...) In short, Shatner was desperate for work, especially something light years away from Captain Kirk. He needed a role that would enable him to go over the top and re-establish his status as a legitimate television star.

And then along came BARBARY COAST.

Cast opposite Shatner was the ever youthful-looking Dennis Cole, who played Cash Conover, the slightly shady but ultimately honourable owner of the Golden Gate Casino and Cable's consistent collaborator. Conover's establishment also provided the perfect hideaway for Cable, accessible only by secret entrances, one through the movable fireplace in Conover's office and the other via a secret elevator. Dennis Cole was a likable actor, a good choice, initially, for the role. A real-life ladies man, Cole's pearly white smile and impressive physique stood in stark contrast to Shatner's more colourful and flamboyant role. It has often been surmised why Cole was replaced by Doug McClure for the series. Perhaps I can digress for a moment and provide some insight...

In 1985, ten years after BARBARY COAST went off the air, I had occasion to work with Dennis Cole in a play, here in Canada. I asked him about working with one of our more famous Canadian exports, William Shatner. Good taste prevents me from recording Cole's exact response. Let's just say he went on (and on) to say that he disliked William Shatner intensely. I often wonder if Dennis Cole ever had the opportunity to meet James ""Scotty"" Doohan, who played on Star Trek with Shatner and whose ruminations about his aversion for Shatner and the problems he encountered working with him are legendary. Cole and Doohan would have got on famously.

Clearly, with Cole being the number two star, such a personal and professional conflict meant that he had to go. Enter Doug McClure.

The Western genre fit Doug McClure like a glove. With two Western series behind him, Overland Trail and the long-running The Virginian, McClure was immediately believable as the new Cash Conover. His physique was on a par with Cole's and his looks were good enough that he could at least hint at being the ladies man, even if the show afforded him little opportunity to demonstrate his appeal in this way. He was also a good contrast to Shatner and was more deft than Cole at the light comedic touch the show required. After a few episodes, McClure made the role his own.

Of the supporting cast, the towering stand out was the gentle giant Richard Kiel, who went from growling a lot in monster movies (at 7 feet, 1 and a half inches in height, Kiel often played the monster) to BARBARY COAST to playing more substantial roles like the villainous ""Jaws"" in two James Bond films. Guest stars were the cream of 1970s television, with a cast list that included Ralph Meeker, Gretchen Corbett, Joseph Campanella and Whit Bissell, to name but a few familiar faces.

BARBARY COAST had decent scripts, many with clever titles such as The Ballad of Redwing Jail, a clever play on the famous poem by Oscar Wilde, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, though how many viewers of the show will make this connection is anyone's guess. One script is a notable exception from the light, semi-comedic tone of the other episodes. The third last program, The Day Cable Was Hanged, is a more serious story about an obsessive general who is convinced that a Shakespearean actor is actually John Wilkes Booth, the man who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. The story is full of historical details and one wonders if this was an attempt to steer the series in a more adult-oriented direction and thereby appeal to a broader audience. BARBARY COAST was of course cancelled before this course could be pursued, but it is an intriguing thought. As it stands, the episode seems more of an aberration than a continuation of the show's basic formula.

Getting back to the supposition that BARBARY COAST was created to appeal primarily to kids, viewed from this perspective, who is the target audience today? People like me, I suppose. The ones who remember this show and the delight we took in trying to guess if the next character on screen was or wasn't William Shatner in disguise. With the smorgasbord of characters placed before him, Shatner makes a meal of each rendition, be it a rustic old seaman, an aging Southern gentleman or an Irish immigrant. If one were to count the different disguises Shatner assays over the course of the pilot movie and the thirteen episodes in this DVD set, one would reach the high double digits, with as many as four or five roles per episode. Interestingly the plenitude of portrayals both highlights Shatner's effectiveness as an actor as well as his weaknesses. He is brilliant at physical characterization, adjusting his posture and mannerisms to suit the action to the word, the word to the action. But when it comes to accents? The less said the better.

Nonetheless, while Shatner's co-stars Doug McClure and Dennis Cole have both passed on, William Shatner continues to entertain audiences today, whether it is in Star Trek re-runs (not to mention the seven Star Trek feature films in which he appeared) or his more recent Emmy-winning performance on Boston Legal and everything in between--including an awful lot of laugh-all-the-way-to-the-bank self parody. This means there are quite a number of William Shatner fans out there who may have never seen or perhaps even heard of BARBARY COAST. And that means there could be a sizable audience just waiting to discover a show when Shatner was still at his physical peak as a performer.

Ultimately, aided by a truly impressive variety of makeup and costumes--indeed half the budget must have been spent on them--William Shatner manages to make the show fun. And this is perhaps the bottom line when considering BARBARY COAST. Is it a brilliant show? No. Does it have flaws. Surely. But it is fun to watch and listen to (the music is another highlight of the series, setting just the right tone from first to last).

I can't think of any other actor (with the possible exception of Johnny Depp in today's acting world) who could've made BARBARY COAST so enjoyable to watch for a young person looking for wholesome television entertainment back in 1975. It is on those terms that this series must be judged.

Ham he may be, but for fans of William Shatner, there's nothing like a good ham sandwich.",1401753600,78,10685,4.841730558598028
6304244,1,B00IXPWGIS,"A short-lived series (only 14 episodes, in an era where 24-26 episodes were the norm) priced at $50..00 is a blatant attempt at theft. Such a package at most should be about $25.00. If you are a William Shatner fan, better to invest your money in Start Trek the Original series or Boston Legal. In the latter he is really funny as ""Denny Crane."" For anyone who wants this -- WAIT -- and WAIT some more.

6304245,5,B00IXPWGIS,"Call it NOSTALGIC, or BOOMER-4-VIEW. Fun retro-ABCTV targeting those of us who watched 60s-70s series. Revisiting these episodes brought back echoes of laughs from yesteryear. Total view time equal to 8 feature films, so to me the Amazon price is reasonable.
""BARBARY COAST"" includes honky-tonk, high-roller saloons, fancy women, steam trains, vigilantes, dance hall floozies, romance, hangings, mud streets of San Francisco, and typical over-the-top bravado western acting of 1975. It is FAMILY COMEDY. No, near nil blood. Nostalgic 6-gun fun! A comedy spoof, like 1974's `Blazing Saddles.' Tongue-in-cheek secret agent suspense in an American Victorian West setting. Chases to make Keystone Cops look dull & slow. My wife and I laughed often.

UPDATE: I managed to get a set of Barbary Coast at a reasonable price, and my wife and I are enjoying it immensely.
The series is sort of a cross between 'The Wild Wild West' and 'Yancey Derringer', featuring a secret operative-and-master-of-disguise working against crime in the 1870s.... Shatner has a ball with the disguises, and Doug McClure is his dashing, but long-suffering partner in adventure. Together, they tackle couterfieters, art thieves, killers, bank robbers, etc.... San Francisco in the period is portrayed with gaudy, bawdy saloons and people being thrown into streets filled with mud, mud, mud (at least you want to think that it is all mud).

FUN STUFF !",1398124800,10,836,4.839160839160839
6304248,2,B00IXPWGIS,"The Barbary Coast was a short-lived comedy western on ABC.  Now I don't know about you, but I don't particularly care for TV western comedies.  Give me a solid serious western like Gunsmoke or The Big Valley anytime.  Now Barbary Coast seemed, at first, to be similar to Wild Wild West.  However, William Shatner in this was more Artemus Gordon than West in that he was a secret service agent who was also a master of disguise.  And unlike Wild Wild West which, while being a western fantasy, was still played relatively straight, this series could never be taken seriously.
Shatner operates out of the gambling casino owned by McClure on San Francisco's Barbary Coast (thus the name.)  Dennis Cole played McClure's role in the pilot film.  However it was felt that McClure was the bigger star so he inherited the role when The Barbary Coast went to series.  Richard Kiel  (""Jaws"" of the James Bond films,) plays a bouncer in McClure's casino.  Since this series took place in a casino, it had its share of barroom brawls and little else.  Shatner and McClure were both wasted and the series was cancelled almost immediately.
As stated, if you want a western series about a dashing secret service agent, stick to the classic Wild Wild West or if you want a western with some wit, perhaps Maverick is for you.  Unlike those series, this show is just mediocre.  When Shatner looks upon his extensive resume, I am sure that this long-forgotten series is not at the top of the list.",1397865600,11,1478,4.66023166023166

There is a hidden passage that leads to a room, where Shatner resides. Shatner's character has a hold over McClures character where he (according to the pilot) knows that McClures character is wanted elsewhere for killing a governer's son. As of the series, Shatner's character saved the life of McClure's character.
