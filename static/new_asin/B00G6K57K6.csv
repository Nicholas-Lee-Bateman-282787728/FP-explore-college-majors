8621067,4,B00G6K57K6,"I know a little more science than the level tackled by the series, but it is entertaining to view and Michael Mosley doesn't say anything wrong. Is it a good series to spur the imagination of a 13 year old child, without letting him or her think that science is just a magic show? Will it give him or her the desire to go farther? I think so. At any rate it is much better than most documentaries television has accustomed us to lately, which are just tom-tom with very little content and no pedagogical value. For its nice effort Michael Mosley's work is quite praiseworthy. The third disk on cell  by Adam Rutherford is also well made and interesting (though a little less ""extraordinary"", ""pathbreaking"", ""mind blowing"", etc. would not hurt).",1520121600,,745,4.643939393939394

8621072,5,B00G6K57K6,"This is a brilliant and entertaining walk through the history of science. While well suited for adults, it is also wonderful for children, many of whom think the information they learn in science class has ALWAYS been known. Viewers are escorted through time to discover when, how and by whom, key events in scientific history were made. It is a fascinating journey that will spark the wonder, curiosity, and imagination of viewers of all ages. Do take note that, as stated, the DVD is in a non-USA format; so be sure you have a player that is compatible.",1337212800,6,555,4.673469387755102
8621073,5,B00G6K57K6,"I have watched this series many times. It is a very nice approach to science, it is not boring, it is active and it takes you to many places in the world, it is like being there when science was created. I hope you buy it and enjoy it as much as I did.",1321488000,2,252,3.685185185185185
