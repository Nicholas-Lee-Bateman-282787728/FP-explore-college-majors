2675253,5,B000JLQPTK,"As the Simpsons reached it's landmark ninth season, by the time the last few episodes came around, it was clear that perhaps there was a decline happening in the series' quality. The season starts out great however with the classic ""City of New York VS Homer Simpson"", as Homer and the family go to New York to recover Homer's illegally parked car. That episode is followed by the somewhat controversial ""Principal and the Pauper"" in which it is revealed that Principal Skinner isn't Principal Skinner, but an imposter, when the real Skinner (voiced by Martin Sheen) returns to Springfield. The ""Treehouse of Horror"" episode this season is a bit disappointing (it just doesn't have those laugh out loud moments that previous ones had), and also throughout this season, Bart tries out for the Homer coached Pee-Wee football team, Apu (Hank Azaria) worries over his arranged marriage, Bart accidently burns up the presents and blames it on made up burglars, and Mr. Burns takes a trip to Cuba with a trillion dollar bill. The standout episodes of this season are undoubtadly ""Bart Carny"" where Homer and Bart get scammed by carnies (one of whom is voiced by the late Jim Varney), and ""The Little Wiggy"" in which Ralph gets set up on a ""play date"" with Bart. The landmark 200th episode, ""Trash of the Titans"", features Steve Martin and U2, but this where you can notice a decline in the show's quality. The season closer, ""Natural Born Kissers"", isn't all that great either sadly, but the good does outweigh the bad here with this season set. All in all, for the most part the ninth season of the Simpsons is the same kind of tongue in cheek humor that you would come to expect, and it's worth picking up for longtime fans of the long running show.",1165363200,9,1745,4.705882352941177

2675255,5,B000JLQPTK,Don't pay attention to all these naysayers.  The Simpsons are still hilarious and this collection is a shining example of their brilliance.  Last week's episode was possibly the best yet in a season that proves the Simpsons are still at the top of their game.,1165276800,4,259,4.733333333333333
2675256,3,B000JLQPTK,"I have been saying it since my review of season 7 - this show had seven stellar years, two more years of holding on by the fingertips, and then zippo, zilcho, crappo.  This is the last year that I can justify buying, mainly for the great Halloween episode (the last great Halloween episode).  Actually, this season somehow managed to have some better episodes than season 8 had - such as Homer joining the NRA and using his gun as an everyday household tool - or the story of Lisa's sax, which is REALLY the story of how Bart went bad - or Homer and Ned Flanders taking turns coaching the pee-wee football team - the kids going ""Lord of the Flies"" on an uncharted desert isle - and the finale which finds Homer and Marge only becoming enamored when on the verge of being caught ""doing it.""  These episodes are worth the price of admission.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the season is filled with ""kill me, please"" episodes such as Homer joing the Navy and commanding a sub . . . Homer becoming an exercise guru . . . Homer fighting the circus carnies . . . Homer joining a cult . . . yes, this is where the ""Homer does it all"" episodes really kicked into high gear.  The ""Super-Homer"" nature of the later seasons is what really killed the show, in my opinion.

I remember watching the premiere episode, in which the family visits New York, with my wife the night it first aired.  After thirty minutes of NOT ONE LAUGH, we looked at each other and agreed that the show was near its end.  The following week saw the incomprehensibly asinine episode in which Skinner learns he isn't really Skinner.  I think my wife quit at this point.  Though there were a few good episodes, as I noted, this one-two punch of suck at the beginning of the season just stole all our interest in continuing the show (which we officially disbanded in early Season 10 - and never looked back).

So, 9 years seems to be the magic number for TV - the really great shows hang their hat at or before 9 (X-Files, Raymond, Seinfeld . . .) - I don't know why so many people are still watching this sad excuse for entertainment.  I don't know why they couldn't just end it and go out on the high note that was Season 7 (or even Season 9).  But, money is money, and execs will stretch anything good out too thin as long as it is  making money (see also LOST) - or cancel something great the second it stops making money (see also INVASION and FIREFLY).  But, I digress . . .

Bottom line, if you were a fan from Season 1, this is about the last year you will find any hint of the brilliance the show once had. I would avoid purchasing any more sets after this one.",1164672000,22,2629,4.270161290322581
2675257,3,B000JLQPTK,"Season nine is the beginning of the end of good Simpsons episodes. The writing takes a significant downgrade as evident in episodes like the one where the pretentious U2 help Homer the trash man dirty-up, then abandon Springfield. Or the one in which Principal Skinner's character is ruined by writing that he is not actually Seymore Skinner (even though he is the spirit & image of his mother Agnes). This episode has the unflattering designation of being ""worst episode ever"", and it is no accident it showed up in season nine. Like most popular phenomenon, and right on cue as expected, the producers take a good thing and make it worse by pushing it to the extreme--I'm talking about Homer here folks, and we all know he used to be funny by being stupid, but now he is just annoyingly stupid without being clever. I have seasons 1-8 and that's where I stop.",1163462400,22,861,4.633986928104576
2675258,5,B000JLQPTK,"this season is gonna be great again. I think the 9th season contains a lot of the best episodes and also a lot of episodes i haven't seen that often. All the people that say that the simpsons are going downhill, are just wrong. I think the simpsons started as the best show on tv and is still going to be the best show on tv for a long time. it seems that the writers never run out of ideas.",1162771200,6,391,3.9
2675259,5,B000JLQPTK,"I don't think there is a decrease in the quality of the Simpsons to this date.  Yes, the show has changed a bit, to address more current events and more wry humor, but I still enjoy it every week.

Season 9 is one of my favorites.  One of the best Treehouse episodes, City of New York, Lisa the Skeptic.  I've downloaded most of these, but the quality is poor, and I'm looking forward to the crisp, bright quality of the DVDs.

I'm curious to know:  Is there some kind of tribute to Phil Hartman on this season?  He did so many great characters, and I think their decision to not recast Troy McClure in his honor was a good one.  I think a look at a great guy, such a shocking loss of a major voice of the cast would be worthy of an ""Extra"" on the discs.",1162339200,12,754,4.047297297297297
2675260,3,B000JLQPTK,"A lot of people designate the 8th season as the last really great season.  Personally I would give that honor to season 7, but as I am writing this I can say that season 9 was still decent, and actually pretty good, comapred to seasons such as 14, which is on right now and is pretty bad.

The Halloween episode was actually arguably better than season 8's (Marge becomes a witch, Bart is merged with a fly).  Other shows include Homer becoming the coach of Bart's football team, the appearance of the real Seymour Skinner, Apu's wedding, Homer allowing carnies to move in with the Simpsons, the trillion dollar bill, climbing the Murderhorn (the mountain), the Canyonero, and U2's appearance.

Since the DVDs have came out I actually have not watched the Simpsons on TV in a while and so I haven't see many of these episodes in a long time.  Nonetheless I'd say that this season was still funny, not to the degree of seasons 3-7, but still enough that I'll shell out $30 and not that much better or worse than season 8.

Also, according to the site, the episode where Homer undertakes to recycle grease was aired between seasons 9 and 10, so I don't know if it will be here or on season 10.

A complete list is available at ""The Simspons Archive"" web site. For those who watch the commentaries, it looks like the episodes were mostly either produced by Mike Scully or Oakley/Weinstein, with a few being done by either Dave Mirkin or Al Jean/Mike Reiss.",1161561600,12,1453,4.522900763358779
2675261,5,B000JLQPTK,"I see every season after season 8 separate, mainly because I have the guide with the first eight seasons. There's been a lot of talk about declining quality with the Simpsons but up until this current season, season 28, I never found a completely horrible one. This season has some great episodes. Homer and the family go to New York city to retrieve the car and everything goes wrong (at least for Homer), Lisa and bart are chosen to be on a news show (and Homer wants a duck for his monkey), we hear how Lisa got her sax (and about the funky grampa), Homer wages a war with the garbage men (and rattles a few bird cages) and Marge and Homer try to rekindle their sex life (and rock the casbah in the craziest of ways). Once again, we have another great season of the Simpsons.",1488240000,2,778,4.299319727891157

2675320,5,B000JLQPTK,"Here is another 25 episode season of The Simpsons that won 3 Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, and the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award. This season also had a few more Emmy nominations as well as nominations from the Saturn Awards and the Golden Reel Awards.

 Notable episodes from this stellar season contain such favorites as ""Simpson Tide"" Where Homer joins the Navy after losing his job. Homer takes command of a sub and gets into some hot water. ""Das Bus"" The school kids are on a field trip and are in a tragic accident that leaves them stranded on an island. ""Natural Born Kissers"" Homer and Marge spice up the bedroom by taking the bedroom out in public places! Works great until they get caught. ""Bart Carney"" Homer and Bart become carnies and get scammed by the very same carnies that took them under their wing. ""Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"" The Cristmas episode in where Bart wakes up early to open gifts early. He gets what he wants which was a toy firetruck which he ironically sets the tree on fire along with everyones gifts. Bart then decides to get rid of the evidence and create a false story of a burglarer stealing Christmas. ""The Cartridge Family"" (One of my personal favorites) Homer buys a gun for protecting his family. Unfortunately, Homer isn't the best person to own a gun and it drives the family away.

 Great season to own! Although this does have a few of my top favorite Simpson episodes, it does have the one episode of the SImpsons that I don't like. ""All Singing, All Dancing"" is my least favorite episode. It's basically a clip show, but of all the musical scenes in the Simpsons rolled into one episode. This is the only one I personally skip ahead. Other than that, Season 9 of The Simpsons is a great addition to any collection.",1401667200,,1831,4.6770186335403725

It's still held in with glue, but it seems like a stronger glue as well, but that's just the base of the internal holder, the rest snap into place and turn like the pages of a book.",1397347200,,525,4.26

2675325,5,B000JLQPTK,"Another great classic season of The Simpsons, from when the show was still at it's creative best!

There is one thing I do not appreciate: I LOVE the commentaries that accompany EVERY episode- as you can imagine, the people who are responsible for making The Simpsons, are quite entertaining and informative. Having these commentaries is like getting double the value for your money, because the commentaries are as good as the actual show; and over the years, I've actually watched the commentaries multiple times. So what's my complaint, you may ask?

My complaint is that Yeardley Smith is on more commentaries in this season than any other thus far! Don't get me wrong, I love what Yeardley does with the Lisa character- I think she is great as a voice actress.....BUT (and I'm sorry to say) the woman is a dolt! All she seems to do on the commentaries, is ask idiotic questions. It's as if one of the other commentators brought in their 5 year-old daughter!

Sheesh! We listen to these commentaries to learn what goes on behind the scenes, and to be entertained by the witty people who make this show. Listening to a grown woman, who is actually involved in the show, ask the other crew members idiotic questions that even children know the answer to, is just a waste, and an embarrassment.

I mean no disrespect, but it's the truth. For goodness' sake, if anyone connected with the show should happen to read this, PLEASE, for the love of Gawd,  DON'T have Mrs. Smith on future commentaries- if for no other reason than to preserve her dignity!

I'm sure I can't be the only one who feels this way. If others reading this agree with me, please add a comment. Thanks.

Everything else about this season is a ""10""! Buy it! It's a classic that will endure for many years. (And from the days when they still packaged these DVDs in normal and sturdy DVD cases!)

But they did go a whole nine years pushing nothing but quality episode after quality episode, which is more than most people expected I believe.

2675355,3,B000JLQPTK,"The Simpsons started one of the first adult yet all-age cartoons that had moral teachings, humor and relatable characters all carried within a unique reflection of the American middle class family. The characters and environments are created in a very surreal yet very realistic way like no other cartoon or even comic book series before. The show spawned 8 awesome seasons that took animation and American pop culture to different heights. However the mild profanity, moral stories and Springfield world started to get tame and dry by the 8th season and wasn't used as creatively as in the previous 7 seasons. Some say it was that the creators ran out of ideas  or it could have been the time era that made it dated, as cartoons around the same time as this season such as Duckman, South Park, and later on Family Guy were taking over with more progressive, creative and entertaining storylines and content than the Simpsons. By this time the show wasn't as powerful as it had been in the early 90's, neither had it been dreadful, but definitely not the most popular show anymore.",1252108800,,1081,4.780748663101604
2675356,4,B000JLQPTK,"To say that the Simpsons season 9 contained more than its share of ""just average"" shows is a bit misleading, as an average Simpsons is generally better than anything else on TV.  No, I mean that there are very few shows that are both memorable AND very funny.  Season 9 is more memorable for starting the great continuity breaks that have (after 18+ seasons) have become a hallmark of the show.  Animation, by its very nature, frees the scriptwriter to explore anything.  With this freedom comes the temptation to experiment with characters and situations.  For example, it's easy to add an enormous mountain to the outskirts of Springfield (""King of the Hill"") - even if there were never any mountains there before!  This season had a number of controversial additions to the ""canon"" of the show.  My favourite controvery was the identity theft by Armand Tanzarian, who becomes Principal Skinner (""The Principal and the Pauper"").  There is also the most blatant (to this point) disregard for continuity in ""Das Bus,"" where, at the end of the story, the kids are still trapped on a desert island.  The 1-line voiceover to resolve this ending is classic, but had the virtue of not having been done.  Social commentary becomes very prevalent in certain episodes as well, especially in the guise of ""Lisa the Skeptic"", which includes voice work by evolutionary biologist and athiest poster boy Stephen J. Gould.

Of the ""classic"" Simpsons seasons (1-10), I think this one is the most obvious bridge to the early-teens seasons that were generally criticised as being unfaithful to the spirit of the show (and not as funny to boot!).  There are, however, many very funny episodes.  A complete list here is redundant, as others have listed all the episodes.  Absolute favourite episodes of mine include:

""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" - this episode will necessarily always be associated with 9/11 due to the prominence in the episode of the Twin Towers.  If you can get around that, it's really the best and funniest episode of the season, and one of the best in the whole series!

""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"" - It's time for Apu's arranged marriage, just as he's learning how much fun bachelor life is.  Manjula was added to the Simpsons pantheon as a recurring character, one that I have thoroughly enjoyed over the years.

""The Joy of Sect"" - not on a lot of favourites lists, but I found this episode hilarious.  Homer joins a cult and Marge enlists Rev. Lovejoy and Willy to try and deprogram him.

""The Last Temptation of Krust"" - not a classic because of the guest stars (including Leno and other stand-up comics), but because of Krusty's hilarious rants (and Homer's responses to them).

""Trash of the Titans"" - Homer runs for sanitation commisioner, beating Steve Martin (well, a character he voiced).  Includes a classic original song about Garbage Men, with guest-performers U2 lending a hand.

There are the usual slate of commentaries (although these are getting a little repetative after this many seasons; what do they even talk about in Season 18 commentaries?)  The best extras are, of course, the deleted scenes.  There's even an entire extra verse to the aforementioned Garbage Man Song.  It's certainly a better way to watch these shows than through syndication.",1251676800,,3295,4.9113924050632916
2675357,5,B000JLQPTK,"I don't really have much to say because this season speaks volumes on it's own.  If you have made it this far with your collection of Simpsons dvds you already know what you are getting...great, quality entertainment without the commercials and other fillers you would have to deal with trying to watch it on regular TV.  For me, this will be my last dvd for The Simpsons (I have seasons 1-9) because I feel like the quality starts to slowly go downhill from season 10 on out.  Even though this will be my last, it's a great dvd to end with.  Most of what I could say has already been reviewed by others but if you like U2, meeting Homer's side of the family (learning about ""The Simpson gene"" that affects the male Simpsons), the kids being washed ashore on a deserted island (aka. The Lord of the Flies spin-off), and other well thought out masterpieces then this is the dvd for you!",1250985600,,885,4.411042944785276

After season 10 it started to go downhill, and while I probably will buy seasons 11 and 12 I probably won't go farther than that. Season 9, however, features one of my all-time favorite episodes, The City of New York VS. Homer Simpson, an episode which was temporarily pulled from sindication following 9/11 and heavily edited even when it returned to TV. Other favorites include Simpson Tide, although that could actually be a seaon 8 episode, and King of the Hill, where Homer is asked by the makers of the Power Sauce bar to climb Springfield's highest mountain, the Murderhorn. We also have such greats as Girly Edition, where Lisa attempts to start a children's news program only to get sidelined by Bart, who starts a popular segment called Bart's People, all while Homer buys and horribly overfeeds a helper monkey named Mojo.

2675365,5,B000JLQPTK,"It'd be easy enough to praise the boxed set of The Simpsons - Season Nine if there were just the episodes themselves to consider.  But as with previous seasons, there is a lot more to enjoy.

Let's start with the box itself:  each of the four discs look like a mock LP, with such names as Cowabunga Records and Atomic Records (with three-eyed fish logo).  Then there are the six postcards, each with different art, including parodies of the album covers for Abbey Road and Nevermind.  The music theme continues in the program booklet which includes ads for a Disco Stu CD and King Toot's Music Store.

Then there are the episodes.  I won't review them all, but a few of note include the season premiere episode, ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" which pokes fun at the Big Apple; this episode would be temporarily put out of circulation after 9/11 due to its depiction of the World Trade Center.  In ""Lisa's Sax"", we learn how Lisa got her sax and Bart got his attitude.  In ""The Joy of Sect"", the family joins a UFO cult.  ""Girly Edition"" satirizes TV news when Bart's shallow human interest stories trump Lisa's fact-filled news.  ""Trash of the Titans"" (the 200th episode) features Steve Martin and U2 and has Homer becoming Sanitation Commissioner; other guest stars this season include Jay Leno, Brendan Fraser, Martin Sheen, Joe Namath, Jim Varney, Helen Hunt, Bob Denver, Alex Trebek and Phil Hartman.

There's a reason that the Simpsons have lasted nearly 20 years, namely because it's so well-written.  Even the so-so episodes are better than most comedies at their best.  But this season has all good-to-great episodes, each with commentary.  There are also plenty of deleted scenes and a few other extras.

2675369,5,B000JLQPTK,"The ninth season of THE SIMPSONS, the longest prime time animated show in history, proved to be a turning point season.  It was a transition year for the show as many writers, runners, etc. who had been with the show left.  Some would argue that season nine was the last great season of THE SIMPSONS for several years until about season fifteen or sixteen.  Reflecting the transition of the show's workforce, season nine includes episodes that have become classic SIMPSONS episodes, e.g. ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" and ""Trash of the Titans"", as well as episodes that were okay, but nothing special, e.g. ""Bart Star"" and ""All Singing, All Dancing.""  Season nine is the last season to feature Phil Hartman  (who was murdered the following summer by his wife) voicing some great secondary characters, such as Lionel Hutz.  The complete list of episodes is:

""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson""--After a late night drinking spree, Homer lets Barney borrow his car.  Weeks later Homer receives a letter from the City of New York informing him that his car is illegally parked and that if it isn't moved, will soon be towed.  Homer hates New York, but packs up the family and sets off on a bus to the Big Apple to get back his car.  This episode has some amazing background and set animation.  It's also features the Twin Towers.  For three years after Sept. 11, 2001, the episode was never seen in syndication but has since been added back into the rotation.  Also, this episode has the first appearance of Duff Man.

""The Principal and the Pauper""--turns out that Principal Skinner isn't the man who he claimed to be over twenty years ago when he returned home from Vietnam.  Turns out Principal Skinner is actually Armin Tamzarian a troubled youth who served under the real Seymour Skinner in Vietnam.  The real Seymour Skinner returns to Springfield and Armin Tamzarian leaves his job and moves to Capital City.

""Lisa's Sax""--Lisa's saxophone is destroyed and Homer and Marge explain how Lisa got her saxophone in the first place.

""Treehouse of Horror VIII""--""Homega Man"" finds Homer as the last man left alive living in Springfield after a nuclear Holocaust.  ""Fly vs. Fly"" has Bart turning into a mutant fly.  ""Easy-Bake Coven"" stars Marge in a segment that parodies THE CRUCIBAL (with a nod to the Scarlet Letter).

""The Cartridge Family""--a soccer riot that leads to city-wide looting and violence causes Homer to decide he needs a gun to protect his family.  He buys a firearm and joins the NRA.  Marge can't stand having the gun in the house and forces Homer to choose between keeping the gun or living with his family.

""Bart Star""--Homer gets Ned Flanders so upset that he quits as the coach of the local pee-wee football team and gives the job to Homer.  Remembering how unsupported his own father was, Homer attempts to build Bart up by showing favoritism and making him the quarterback.  However, Bart isn't any good and finds himself the center of physical correction by his teammates.

""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons""--Apu is the most eligible bachelor in Springfield and is living the good life.  That is until his mother writes to inform him she is coming to visit along with his pre-arranged bride, Manjula, so that they can be married.

""Lisa the Skeptic""--during a school archeological dig, Lisa uncovers what appears to be the skeleton of an angel.  Lisa is skeptical, but the town finds itself in a frenzy.

""Realty Bites""--Marge gets a job as a real estate agent.  I believe this is the first appearance of Gil.

""Miracle on Evergreen Terrace""--during a morning of Christmas greed, Bart accidentally burns down the Christmas tree and all the Christmas presents.  He hides the evidence under a pile of buried snow in the front yard.  The citizens of Springfield take pity upon the Simpsons in a scene taken from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  That is until the townfolk find out exactly what Bart did.

""All Singing, All Dancing""--a clip show told in song that looks back at some of the singing and dancing moments of the first eight seasons of THE SIMPSONS.

""Bart Carny""--Bart and Homer start working at a traveling carnival after Bart destroys Hitler's car.  Bart and Homer befriend one of the carnies and his son, but soon find themselves in a battle of wits as the carnies squat the Simpsons' home.

""The Joy of Sect""--the Simpsons and many of the other citizens of Springfield find themselves joining and being brainwashed into a cult.  Marge escapes and with the help of Ned Flanders and Rev. Lovejoy attempts to get her family back and uncover the scam The Leader is pulling.

""Das Bus""--the Simpsons take on LORD OF THE FLIES.  A Springfield Elementary bus crashes and the students find themselves on a deserted island and attempt to build a society of their own.

""The Last Temptation of Krust""--Krusty realizes that his material hasn't aged well and thinks about leaving the business.  That is until he just starts telling the truth and discovers comedy gold.

""Dumbell Indemnity""--Moe falls in love and gives his new girlfriend the best that money can buy.  However, the money dries up and Moe decides to commit insurance fraud, with the help of Home, in order to keep his lady in style.  Homer is caught and Moe lets him take the fall.

""Lisa the Simpson""--Lisa is afraid she might be losing her intelligence and is told by all the male members of her family that there is nothing she can do because of the ""Simpson"" gene that brings about ignorance.  She decides to sap out the best from life she can before she forgets how to enjoy things like jazz and museums.

""This Little Wiggy""--Marge forces Bart to have a playdate with Ralph Wiggum.  Bart becomes friends with Ralph and with the help of Chief Wiggum's master town key they have the time of their lives.  This is the episode when Ralph first mentions the leprechaun that tells him to burn things.

""Simpson Tide""--Home and his friends join the Naval Reserve and find themselves aboard a nuclear submarine.  After the Captain is ejecting from a torpedo tube, Homer finds himself in command of the vessel and attempting to ward of an international incident.

""The Trouble with Trillions""--Homer finds himself working for the IRS after failing to fill out an income tax return properly.  Homer agrees to entrap Mr. Burns because of a mysterious trillion dollar bill Mr. Burns stole from the government over fifty years before.

""Girly Edition""--Lisa and Bart become co-anchors of a children's operating news program.

""Trash of the Titans""--the 200th episode of THE SIMPSONS.  Homer decides to run for the office of sanitation commissioner and brings about radical changes when elected.  Steve Martin and U2 both guest voiced.

""King of the Hill""--in attempt to win over the adoration of Bart, Homer secretly begins bulking up.  He's approached by two promoters and agrees to climb the killing mountain, Murderhorn.

""Lost Our Lisa""--Lisa finagles her way into getting to ride the public bus downtown to see a special Egyptian exhibit at the museum.  The bus doesn't go where she wants to and she finds herself wandering around Springfield alone.  Homer attempts to rescue her and they share a very special father and daughter moment together.

""Natural Born Kissers""--Marge and Homer's love life has grown stale.  After discovering how excited they are after almost being caught in public, there passion is reignited.  Then they are almost discovered at a miniature golf course and are forced to flee through town naked.

My favorite episodes from this season are ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"", ""Treehouse of Horror VII"", ""Bart Carny"", ""Das Bus"", ""Trash of the Titans"", and ""Lost Our Lisa.""

Special features in the season nine set include commentaries for all the episodes; a couple of Bit From the Animators segments with Yeardley Smith, Pete Michels, Mike Anderson, and Matt Groening, a moment with U2; Butterfinger commercials and an commercials for an Australian snack called CCs; a riff from Matt Groening; deleted scenes; original sketches; and two animation showcases.

All said and done, Season Nine is a great season of THE SIMPSONS.",1191715200,6,8158,4.881454545454545

Sure, you still have classic episodes that reward repeated viewings like The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson, Das Bus, and Lisa the Simpson...but you also have to reacquaint yourself with Homer the Jerk in episodes like The Cartridge Family and wonder about seemingly forced stories like Realty Bites.  On the whole, though, it's still satisfying and occasionally belly laugh-inducing stuff.",1189900800,3,615,5.26530612244898

I have all the sets through the 10th season, and as much as I adore The Simpsons, I think there are hot and cold episodes in each set. The 9th season is a particularly potent collection, though. I didn't realize so many of my favorite episodes were put out in one season. If you're a Simpsons fan that's maybe not so obsessed with buying each season on DVD as soon as it comes out, an obsession with which I'm afflicted, you should still shell out the bucks for the ninth season. My housemates and I watched three of the four discs the night I received the set, and all of us, Simpsons-crazed and not, were laughing out loud throughout.",1189468800,,686,4.409448818897638
2675376,3,B000JLQPTK,"... The DVD is great, no worries. The set, and menus and all are all great. Its the show's quality I'm refering to.

Season Eight was the last great season. From season Nine, the show began its inevitable decline. Slowly but painfully, as we watch through these episodes.

""The Principal and the Pauper"" is the prime example of this season's goal - gimmick. No genuine heart-felt stories, no character, no nothing. Just something outrageously silly to attract the masses and challenge the fans.

Anywho, they are some good ones, like ""Lisa the Simpson"", or ""Last Temptation of Krusty"", or the instant Simpsons classic, and best of this season, ""Homer Simpson vs. New York"". And as usual, ""Treehouse of Horror"" is as good as one expects it to be.

Overall, not bad, but not great. The first not-excellent Simpsons season is now here. If you just love Homer Simpson, then by all means, have it.",1186617600,6,892,4.7727272727272725

Many people try to say that The Simpson's quality has declined right around Season 10 or so, and I personally believe that the decline was introduced around Season 8 or 9. Some of the episodes in this boxed set are pretty weak, however, there ARE some that are really funny. The ratio(good episodes to bad episodes), I personally think with this boxed set, is not really worth the money unless you are a big fan of the Simpsons or you collect them. There seem to be more not-so-funny boring episodes than there are entertaining/funny episodes, and it is obvious that the Simpson's series starts to somewhat decline right around this season.",1184976000,4,647,4.776785714285714

2675384,4,B000JLQPTK,"I used to think that season 9 was the season that The Simpsons started motoring up that ramp towards the shark.  After watching this 4 DVD set, however, I found a lot of very good episodes, especially the ones featuring Lisa which is probably why she got the cover to this set.  I like the old record label theme to the pacakaging.  I prefer the box packages to the head shaped ones as I think they are cooler looking and a little easier to work with.  The ramp might have been under construction, but this was not the season The Simpsons jumped the shark.  DVDs contain the usual commentaries and deleted scenes.

Disc 1:

""The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"": Barney abandons Homer's car in the city he despises the most: New York City.  When Homer takes his family to retrieve the vehicle, they experience the best the city has to offer while Homer experiences the worst

""The Principal and the Pauper"": Strange episode where the Simpsons started getting more outlandish storylines.  It turns out that Seymour Skinner stole his identity from his Army Sergeant thought to be dead.  Skinner's mother's acceptance is actually rather believable but how the town reacted to the revelation (what the real Skinner did to receive such scorn is unclear) is almost silly.  The judge was right; this episode should never be spoken of again.

""Lisa's Sax"": One of my favorites.  A story about how Lisa got her saxophone (or ""saxomaphone"" as Homer calls it) turns into a cute flashback story about how Bart became a proud underachiever.

""Treehouse of Horror VIII"": One of the better Halloween specials. ""The Homega Man""--Mayor Quimby offends the French and Homer thinks he's the sole survivor of the resulting neutron blast, until he's encountered by zombies. ""Fly Vs. Fly""--Bart uses a Professor Frink's transporter to morph with a fly.  I like when the spider shakes his fists at Bart the prankster fly and when monster Bart is choking Lisa in the kitchen and Homer is seen in the background using the transporter to get a beer out of the fridge.  ""Easy-Bake Coven""--Marge and her sisters turn out to be real witches in 1649 Sprynge Fielde.

""The Cartridge Family"":  A soccer riot causes Marge to be concerned about the safety of her family so Homer gets a gun but is so irresponsible with it that Marge feels even less safe.  Homer is very over-the-top here.

""Bart Star"":  Homer becomes coach of Bart's peewee football team and gives him special treatment.  Joe Namath is guest.

Disc 2:

""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"":  Just when the single women of Springfield discover Apu as a hot bachelor, he is summoned to an arranged marriage.  He tries to get out of it by pretending to be married to Marge.  Very funny.  When Apu's mother falls outside the Kwiki Mart, Apu is relieved that it buys him time.  Homer thinking about a yodle he ate and forgetting to tell Marge about the plan is hilarious.

""Lisa the Skeptic"":  Interesting episode.  Honor students are rewarded and detention students are punished with an archeological dig where Lisa discovers a skeleton that looks like an angel.

""Reality Bites"":  Homer buys Snake's beloved sports car at a police seized-property auction and Snake wants revenge.  Meanwhile, Marge becomes a Realtor and sells the Flanderses the town murder house.  Stupid ending.

""Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"": Bart burns down the family Christmas presents and plastic tree and makes up a story about being robbed.  The town supports them until they find out it's a hoax.  Guest Alex Trebek.  OK in parts but silly in others.  Goes all over the place.

""All Singing All Dancing"":  Clips of past musical numbers. Totally lame.

""Bart Carny"": Homer takes in a couple of carnies down on their luck and they help themselves...to the Simpsons' home.  Special guest: Jim Varney.

""The Joy of Sect"": Homer, and most of Springfield, join the Movementarians.  ""Church, cult, cult, church.  So we get bored someplace else every Sunday.  Does this really change our day-to-day lives?""--Bart.

Disc 3:

""Das Bus"": A take-off of Lord of the Flies where Bart and his classmates are stranded on a deserted island.

""The Last Temptation of Krust"": When his nightclub act is a bust, Krusty the Clown decides to retire until he finds out that criticizing other comics and money-grubbing companies will reinvent his career.  Comedy, however, turns out not to be what's really in his blood.  Guests include Jay Leno, Janeane Garofalo, Bobcat Goldthwait.

""Dumbbell Indemnity"":  Mo finally finds a woman who will go out with him but resorts to deception and fraud to keep her.  Not one of my favorites.

""Lisa the Simpson"":  The best episode of this season.  Lisa is puzzled by a kid's puzzle and freaks out when grandpa tells her about the Simpson gene that causes Simpsons to go through a process of ""dumbening.""

""This Little Wiggy"":  Marge sets up a playdate for Bart--Ralph Wiggum.  Bart and Ralph get hold of Police chief Wiggum's master key and use it to turn on an electric chair at an abandoned prison.  Coincidentally, Mayor Quimby decides to reopen the prison and use the chair for a publicity stunt.

""Simpson Tide"": Homer and his pals join the Naval Reserve and is put in charge by his captain (Capt. Tennille ha, ha), shoots his captain out a torpedo tube, and takes his sub into Russian waters.  Yeah, it's as stupid as that.  Guests voices: Bob Denver, Rod Steiger.

""The Trouble With Trillions"": After a severe audit, Homer is hired by the IRS to help convict Mr. Burns for stealing a trillion dollar bill from the government.

Disc 4:

""Girly Edition"": Lisa and Bart co-anchor a kid's news TV show and Lisa thinks Bart's manipulative ""Bart's People"" segments are jeopardizing the integrity of the show.  Meanwhile, Homer gets a helper monkey who turns out to be as fat and lazy as he is.  ""But what do you expect?  His cholesterol is through the roof!"" Better than average episode.

""Trash of the Titans"":  200th episode.  Why that is so important, I don't know.  Homer gets into a fight with the garbage men and they cut off his service.  Homer takes on the city and campaigns to become Sanitation Commissioner. ""It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David's going to win.""  U2 makes appearance.  Crying Indian at the end for us Generation Xers.

""King of the Hill"": Another of the better episodes.  After being humiliated in front of Bart during a church picnic game of capture the flag, Homer starts working out and eating Powersauce bars.  For a Powersauce promotion, Homer attempts to climb the Murderhorn.  Highlight--The Commi-Nazi logo in the McBain movie.

""Lost Our Lisa"": Lisa really wants to see the Isis exhibit at the museum but no one will drive her.  She decides to take the bus alone and gets lost.  Touching father/daughter ending.

""Natural Born Kissers"": Homer and Marge try to spice up their marriage by getting romantic in forbidden places.",1178323200,3,6902,4.833904109589041

In my opinion season 9 includes many treasures of the 18 (ok, season 18 is still running) Simpsons seasons: Recently the episode ""The city of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" was voted number 1 episode out seasons 1-16 in Germany.

Do You remember ""Fly vs. Fly"" taken from the fabulous Treehouse of Horror episode of this season - that is one of the best horror stories, or Homer using the teleport device to pee or get beer from the couch? Also great: The Cartridge Family, when Homer waits for his revolver and all the shootable ""objects"" appear, i like Patty and Selma best. The Simpsons loose their home in Bart Carny and Homer has to get it back with his frisbee skills, the joy of sect shows a taste of simp-entology, ""das bus"" sends the kids into the wilderness and Moe finally finds his big love (Helen Hunt). Take a good look at the male Simpsons in ""Lisa the Simpson"", especially their jobs. Don't miss the trillion dollar episode, Krusty's porn collection, and all the places Homer and Mage make love in the final episode of this great season.

My least favorite episode on this set would have to be The Principal and the Pauper. After watching that episode I knew the inevitable downhill slide for this series had begun.

In many places, it felt like the writers were trying too hard, or in some cases not trying hard enough, and they started with a few story ideas that weren't all that great to begin with. In any case, the finely tuned situations, impeccable timing, spot-on delivery, and humor from the previous seasons is often lost. The series feels off-kilter in a number of ways.

There are a lot of cracks that begin to show up in construction of these episodes. First, a lot of the writing is subpar. The animation also begins to suffer. And a lot of the dialogue seems forced, as if the actors no longer care as much about their product, they're just there for the paycheck.

Now, that being said, there are a number of real gems in this set, including: Realty Bites, Trash of the Titans, The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson, and Bart Carny.

Overall, I'd say its still worth purchasing, but as the quality of this series goes downhill starting here with the Ninth Season, let's hope the $40 entry fee will also start to go down a little, too. This is the first time I've bought a Simpsons DVD set that left a hint of a bad taste in my mouth.",1170720000,14,1486,4.369565217391305
2675400,5,B000JLQPTK,"Like many other reviewers, I believe this is the beginning of the end for the Simpsons' run of greatness. In all honesty, the show was not consistently funny until Season 4, when the writers started focusing more on Homer, and less on Bart, who was getting rather predictable. Season 9 treats us to Homer at his finest in some episodes, but also fails to fully exploit his stupidity in some episodes, and uses it too much in others. Still, the truly funny episodes make up for the forgettable ones. Here are some of my favourite episodes, along with a brief synopsis, and perhaps even a favourite line or two:

The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson: When Barney illegally parks Homer's car at the foot of the World Trade Center, the Simpsons take a trip to the Big Apple. ""Ewwww, ech, I'll have a crab juice.""

The Cartridge Family: After a soccer riot spills over into the entire city, Homer buys a gun to protect his family. (Waiting is the Hardest Part by Tom Petty - pretty awesome sequence)

Bart Star: Homer coaches Springfield's Pee-Wee football team, and makes Bart the starting QB despite his ineptitude. Homer cuts the entire crew of the show while credits roll. Hilarious!

The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons: Apu just starts to enjoy life as a bachelor, when his mother reminds him of his imminent arranged marriage. In a desperate attempt to deceive his mother, Apu pretends to be married to Marge. ""What's with the dot on your forehead, does it change colours when you're angry?""

Bart Carny: Jim Varney guests as a carny in this episode, in which Bart and Homer work at the carnival, but wind up losing the Simpsons' home.

The Joy of Sect: Homer joins a cult (oops, sect) but Marge uses beer to bring him back to reality. How's that for irony?

Das Bus: A Springfield Elementary field trip goes awry and the kids wind up shipwrecked on an island, without adult supervision. Homer attempts to start up his own internet business. ""They have the internet on computers now!""

The Last Temptation of Krust: A washed-up Krusty the Clown rejuvenates his career with a new ""street"" image. But can the king of cheesy merchandise resist the temptation of corporate sponsorship? ""Don't you hate pants?""

Dumbbell Indemnity: Moe finds a woman who is willing to put up with his sweat and lack of tact... but how long will it last? ""Very well sir... lobster stuffed with tacos.""

This Little Wiggy: Marge forces Bart to befriend Ralph Wiggum. Bart steals Chief Wiggum's key to the city, and the fun ensues! ""Well, I'm an idiot!""

Trash of the Titans: This legendary 200th episode of the Simpsons features the voices of Steve Martin and all 4 members of U2. Homer becomes the new sanitation commissioner and finds creative ways to dispose of trash.

King of the Hill: Tired of the embarrassment of being fat, Homer gets himself into shape, and attempts to climb the Murderhorn to impress his family. ""Ohhhh... a GYME.""

Special features are up to the high standard Simpsons fans expect and appreciate: audio commentary on every episode, animatics, extra language feature, a bit from the animators, etc. I didn't see the point of doing one of the latter for ""All Singing, All Dancing"" which is a clip show. But otherwise it is all good stuff. Oh, and there is even a sneak preview of the upcoming Simpsons movie, set for release this summer! I can't WAIT!

When watching this season, at the time it was broadcast, I remember thinking that for the first time that some shows were actually kinda bad, which was sad... but still there are many fine moments. I found the episodes with Priniciple Skinner, Lisa's Sax, and Moe dating to be quite bad, and the Apu running lame storyline kinda stupid and kinda racist. The Burns Trillion dollar and the X-mas episode to be very inferior to previous similar episodes.  Homer in the navy is such lazy writing, I guess trying to maintain the Conan legacy of absurdity.

I don't watch many new episodes of ""The Simpsons"" (I feel that it stopped being funny during Season 11, but I'll save that for a forum discussion), but I can never get enough of the older episodes and the ninth season still brought the laughs. The writing was a little different and so were the jokes but the characters were so well developed that the stories wrote themselves. If there were any joke that I didn't find funny, it's because I tried to compare it to older episodes. The reality of it all is that if you laughed at these episodes back then, you'll laugh at them now. There's no need to analyze this season. Why would you anyway, it's ""The Simpsons"", you're not supposed to think while you watch this!

The DVD format is great as it usually is. I don't know about anyone else, but I love the menu setups for their sets, including this one. The animation there is great.

Apu's wedding was quite amusing, esp. w/Jan Hooks and Andrea Martin providing some support. The story of Lisa's sax has a great 'All in the Family' homage at the beginning, and Krusty's 'new comedy' has many classic moments. In short, Simpsons fans will not be disappointed.

Like the previous 8 seasons, it's filled with celebrity guests (one of them happens to be U2), funny one-liners, and plenty of ""D'ohs"" from Homer. In this episode, we get to see Homer's beef with New York, Lisa finding an angel in a construction site (which turns out to be a publicity stunt), Homer entering the navy, and even Apu getting married (who eventually cheats on later in the series)! This season also introduces Dufman and Gil, 2 of the best ""side"" characters in the series. In the Halloween episode, we what Homer does when he finds out he's the last person on Earth (which is dancing around nude), what would happen if Bart's body got switched to a Fly's, with his body having a fly's head after a failed experiment in teleportation devices Homer bought at Professor Frink's yard sale (""I'll teach you to mess with my machine!""), and we're finally taught that Marge IS a witch (""Well I'll be a son of a witch!"")! My favorite episode on the season, though, would have to Simpson Tide, where Homer becomes in charge of a nuclear sub (""it's pronounced nukular!""), and uses Bart's ear piercing to plug the leak in the sub (Bart: ""Didn't you ever do anything outragous when you were a kid?"" Homer: ""Well, when I was 10 I pierced my ear, but this is completely different!"").

2675417,5,B000JLQPTK,"I know people will say that this season marked the decline of the Simpsons.  But this season produced some of my favorite classic episodes.  Just to names a few, it begins with a bang when the family travels to New York to retrieve their ilegally parked car.  Other stand outs are the one where Homer buys a gun and uses it for everything (open a beer, turn on the tv), and when their house gets taken over by carnies, as well as the one where the kids are stranded on an island Lord of the Flies style.

My least favorite episode would have to be ""All Singing, All Dancing"", a clip episode featuring old songs on the show, and where they sing for the entire episode.  This season is also notable for featuring the 200th episode ""Trash of the Titans"", where Homer has a feud with some garbage men and then ends up running for Sanitation Commisioner with hilarious results.

The features are pretty much same as always.  Commentaries on every episode occasionally featuring the actors, lots of early storyboards and deleted scenes, as well as an unfinished clip of the Simpsons movie that's coming out.

2675418,4,B000JLQPTK,"The Simpsons stands as the funniest show to ever grace the television screen.  The dry and biting humor that formed the comedic genius of this series carried it for many many years.  I consider season 10 to be the last season that displayed some worthiness. That being said, season 9 has some great classic episodes such as ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"", ""The Trouble with Trillions"", ""Girly Edition"", and the somehow often ignored episode ""King of the Hill"".

  As great as some of these episodes are, one can see the frailty of the writing on other episodes. An example is ""Simpson Tide"", where Homer is in command of a US Navy nuclear submarine. While the premise is funny, the delivery is off and the jokes start to trip over themselves. This is just the beginning of the end as this trend carries on and gets even worse in the later seasons. However, the good and great episodes on this season warrant four stars. Theres just something awesome about watching Homer as he leans against his car parked by the late Twin Towers in NYC while people toss change his way. ""Hey..! I'm not a beggar!"" ""Well thank you, but I don't really.."" ""hmmmm.."" Then after asking the next lady that walks by for spare change following her refusal: ""Lousy cheapskate!"" That kind of humor IS the Simpsons. I also don't really know why people refuse to acknowledge the greatness of ""King of the Hill"". This episode, in my opinion, is easily in the top 5 Simpsons of all time. The humor is classic Schwartzwelder, from Grandpa Simpson explaining to Homer how he ""died"" on the Murderhorn by falling ""8000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks"" to Homer's hallunigenic encounter with a Yetti as he slides in delerium down the face of the mountain. BRILLIANTLY STUPID HUMOR. Right up there with ""Boy Scoutz in the Hood"".

Season 9 is essentially a mixed bag of Simpsons episodes, ranging from all time classics, to candidates for worst episode ever, with everything in-between.

As an earlier reviewer mentioned, the show became more dependent on bit characters playing major roles in epidoses, like Ralph's role in This Little Wiggy (a great episode).  While this has presented problems in more recent seasons, it was a fresh idea in Season 9 and it works beautifully.  Also, the addition of guest stars like Joe Nameth and Bill Gates, among others, was a great addition to the show.  In more recent episodes, the entire 30 minutes has been spoiled with guest stars, but in Season 9, the guests began appearing just long enough to mix things up.

Season 9 is also heavy on clever political satire, which is never bad.  I took an American civics class several years ago and the teacher showed several episodes from Season 9 as part of the course curriculum. This season is also the most quotable, including Homer's gem ""Animals are crapping in our houses and we're picking it up!  Did we lose a war?  That's not America!  That's not even Mexico!""

1)  The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson.  This show absolutely serves notice that the quality is gone.  Not only does it trot out every tired old, uninspired cliche these guys could come up with, but check out the background animation: it's nice to see that the people who brought us Hong Kong Phooey in the 70s have again found gainful employment.  For those of you too young to know Hong Kong Phooey, check out the drawing of the two towers while Homer is keeping watch over his car (in one of the most boring and drawn out scenes in Simpson history); it looks like they were drawn by first-graders.  This is not what I've come to expect from these guys.

2)  The Principle and the Pauper.  In any previous season, this would be an OK but nothing special episode--not terrible, but only a couple minor laughs.  In this season, it is the stand-out gem.

3)  Lisa's Sax.  Every season has a really bad show in which one of the adults reminisces about the way things were.  In these episodes, the running joke is the kids don't care.  In reality, no one else does either.  Here's my radical thought: if you can't come up with an idea for a show, don't do one.  There is nothing of interest here.

4)  Tree House of Horror.  I'll be honest: I skipped this one.  These shows are generally lame with a few exceptions in some of the earliest seasons, so what's the point?

5)  The Cartridge Family.  Jokes just miss, and this show is a reminder of how good the Simpson creators were in the past and how good this show could have been if they were as creative when they were writing it as they were in earlier seasons.  Again, check out the backgrounds--the animation is very weak.

6)  The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons.  Where are the conspiracy theorists when we need them?  Did someone kidnap Groening and the writers and replace them with less talented imposters?  This show is all the evidence that I need.

7)  Lisa the Skeptic.  OK, the ending was funny, but the show was weak.  There were a number of good ideas that could have been funny, but the writers did not deliver.

  So what's the point of continuing?

2675429,4,B000JLQPTK,"After almost a decade of Simpsons perfection or near-perfection, Season 9 is the beginning of a painful era, in which the emerging weaknesses of the series became more visible than its established strengths. It would take several years for the show to recover from a mediocre team of writers and producers with a painful shortage of new ideas or subversive laughs. The key to keeping the series even partially fresh during this uneven season was to introduce new developments for some of the supporting characters, particularly Apu in ""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons,"" Moe in ""Dumbell Indemnity,"" and Ralph in ""This Little Wiggy."" The series continued to excel by building a very well-defined cast of supporting characters,

However, character development for the main Simpson family pretty much screeched to a halt this season. This goes especially for Homer, who was nearly ruined this season. Homer's endearing denseness has become simpleton stupidity, played for cheap laughs, while the writers had him committing a distressing quantity of criminal acts. Homer was also subjected to the very amateurish writing strategy of forcing him into new occupations in practically every other episode - all of which wreck the show's continuity and are then never mentioned again - including football coach, carnival worker, naval reservist, FBI informant, sanitation commissioner, and mountain climber. Throwing around transitory one-time ideas like this does constitute quality character development. Meanwhile, fans should be particularly troubled by the completely nonsensical dead-end plots in the awful ""Das Bus"" and ""King of the Hill.""

This season also began a worrisome decline in production quality. For example, see the horrendous animation of the football action in ""Bart Star,"" or the sluggish choreography and music in the new segments of ""All Singing, All Dancing."" The humor's traditional sharp timing and quickness are also sadly deficient this season. The traditional subversive deep thoughts have been largely replaced by cheap guffaws, and even those are in short supply. Just try to find such low quality at any point in the series since the first season, when the team was understandably still refining the show's style. As for the ongoing writing and development of the series, there are still a few episodes in Season 9 that display the old Simpsons brilliance, like ""The Joy of Sect"" or ""Lost Our Lisa."" But by Season 9 the golden age was over, and changing production personnel can be blamed. Granted, it's amazing for a show to maintain a high standard of quality for nine years, much less eighteen out in TV land. But even the Simpsons had their ups and downs, and the downs can still be distressing to longtime fans. For collectors of the DVD series, the dark ages are upon us.

2675431,5,B000JLQPTK,"Maybe the series has lost quality in material in the last few years, but it is still funnier than most shows on TV today. With the loss of Seinfeld, Cheers, Raymond, Frasier, Cosby, Friends, and Will and Grace there is not much on TV as far as sitcoms. The CSI shows, House, NUMB3RS, Rescue Me are great dramas that I watch on a regular basis, but I can't name a new sitcom that I watch at all except for the Simpsons. This my opinion, and I am not putting down other comedies. The Simpsons tackle any and every subject of life and culture with great humor and wit. I admit some of the shows are corny, but at least every other phrase does not start with ""like the time when..."" (Family Guy).  I have seasons 1-9 and plan on buying them all and seeing the movie in 2007. The DVD sets cost around $30, which is cheap compared to other sets. Some TV shows on DVD can cost as much as $70. I think its a small price to pay for some great laughs. Maybe there are some duds in each season, but since there are 2 seasons come out twice a year it is an affordable investment. Plus one of the seasons usually comes out before the holidays, so you may have to buy one and get one for free. Do yourself a favor buy all the seasons, buy some donuts, Duff beer, and set back and laugh!",1166572800,3,1272,4.108433734939759
2675432,5,B000JLQPTK,"If you're anything like me, you're such a huge Simpsons fan that you ran out and bought Season 9 yesterday, the day it released to DVD. And if you haven't yet picked it up and you're a huge Simpsons fan, you simply MUST! When you load in the first disc, it automatically plays a rough cut scene from the upcoming movie set to open in July 2007, which is quite a pleasant surprise. Of course, you'll find all of Season 9's fantastic episodes, like the one where Homer and family head to New York to get Homer's car, one they never show on air anymore since the tragedy on September 11th. You'll also find the one with the Movementarians cult, the one where Bart & Homer become carnies, the one where Homer becomes sanitation commissioner, and the one where Apu gets married, just to name a few. There's also tons of deleted scenes and fun extras to play with. Truly a must-have for your Simpsons collection and since it's the season for giving right now, would make any Simpson fan's holiday season much cheerier. You'll love it! Enjoy!",1166572800,4,1035,4.51063829787234
2675433,5,B000JLQPTK,"By Season 9, it was clear that the Simpsons were running out of gas, but everything fell into place for the 200th episode, ""Trash of the Titans.""  Although the NYC show is memorable, Trash of the Titans (an Emmy-winner and perhaps one of the five or ten best episodes ever) succeeds brilliantly by involving the entire town of Springfield as well as some great guest stars (U2 & the perfectly-cast Steve Martin) who actually contribute to the story and are not just tinsel - not to mention the marvelous song ""The Garbageman Can.""  Unlike most later episodes, which revolve around one character or are merely chapters of the ""Homer Simpson is Stupid"" show, ""Trash of the Titans"" recalls the glory days of the series, when the show was less about buffoonery and more of a seriously funny social satire.  Kudos to Ian Maxtone-Graham, the writer of this hilarious and incisive episode.",1166572800,,882,4.827814569536423

2675435,5,B000JLQPTK,"I'm a huge Simpsons fan, and a total trivia buff, so this season really delivered.  We learn new things about almost all the characters and secrets are revealed.  The stories are not as great as the other seasons, but they are still lots of fun.  This is the last great season, as everyone has said before, with the dialogue and feeling completely spiraling towards the current season which has hit rock bottom.  You can tell that they are running out of ideas in Season 9, but they make up for it with good dialogue, and only slightly contrived material.  Plus, this is the only way to see the episode ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"", since FOX banned it from being aired because it has the twin towers in them.  Lame, but true.  Definitely a good buy though.",1166227200,,769,4.45
2675436,2,B000JLQPTK,"This is where it ended.  From seasons one through eight (especially four through eight), the Simpsons were a groundbreaking, occasionally sardonic, always witty satire of American life.  But in season nine, something terrible happened and the show changed dramatically.  It were as if there was a writers exodous and those brought in to fill the ranks couldn't conceive of anything other than bland, unintelligent humor.  The dry wit, double entendres, and genius that had characterized the show suddenly vanished and we were left with this.  It's not that season nine was terrible, it was just so average when compared to the stratospheric heights at which the bar was once held.",1166227200,13,680,5.1454545454545455
2675437,4,B000JLQPTK,"Season Nine is a underrated season with Underated Episodes.

Trouble with Trillions, The Helen Hunt Episode, Girly Edition Classic Simpsons they have aged like Fine Wine.  But alas the Audio Commentary blows.  I guess they don't watch the  episodes over and over again lke me.  But I will continue to own them all.  I don't like the First Six Seasons.....Weird HUH?  And the NYC Episode I wish would come back into syndication.  I mean if Homer Destroyed, Disrespected, the Two Towers i'd understand.  But he's just waiting for the Car boot to come off and then he runs to Tower one and two to go to the bathroom.  That's it, nothing more. Well my FYE Sold this DVD Set early than its supposed release date.  But it's worth watching over and over again.",1166227200,2,753,4.586466165413534
2675438,3,B000JLQPTK,I feel that Season 8 was incredible while Season 9 is far less entertaining.  The dropoff is enormous.  Stick to Seasons 1 through 8.  Season 9 is the beginning of the end for this highly successful show.,1165968000,11,204,4.45945945945946
