4471458,5,B004UXUVFW,"The complete corruption of modern media by commercialization could not be more brilliantly presented in this very funny, very tragic documentary told tongue very firmly in cheek by Morgan Spurlock. It's actually a metaphor also for the corruption of the soul, which is what it would have to be: if the society is decaying, then obviously the individuals within it also are. That's heavy, but the film is not, which is its brilliance. A zeitgeist film for the 10 decade.",1320278400,,469,4.875

4471460,3,B004UXUVFW,"Advertising is everywhere, including stealthy product placements in movies. So Morgan Spurlock goes to various potential sponsors and pitches them the idea of participating in (sponsoring) his movie about how advertising is sold into movies. He approached about 600 brands, and 22 of them agreed to be sponsors. His movie only cost $1.5 million to make, which probably is a miracle of some sorts. POM Wonderful (pomegranate juice) paid $1 million for the lead advertising role. Hyatt Hotels, Sheetz gas stations and food, JetBlue Airlines, Merrell shoes, and MiniCooper cars. Also featured were a number of marketing professors and luminaries, such as Noam Chomsky, Sut Jhally, Ralph Nader, Quentin Tarantino, Donald Trump, Martin Lindstrom, etc.

Martin Lindstrom uses fMRI to determine what people really think, contending that much of what we tell market researchers ins't true. (That supposedly explains why, despite spending $12 billion/year on market research each year in the U.S., 80% of new product launches fail within the first three months.) Surprisingly, one of his findings, is that product placement within a movie doesn't work unless an integral part of the plot. (So why did Spurlock include him in the movie, or even make the movie?)

Bottom-Line: Morgan Spurlock is an interesting and talented person. His movie, 'The Greatest Movie Ever Sold' is somewhat interesting, but definitely not educational.",1317772800,,1419,5.416289592760181
4471461,3,B004UXUVFW,"As the credits roll on this documentary I can't help but feel... unfulfilled. I expected so much more from the film, perhaps this is Spurlock's idea of artistic irony. With all the hype and all the potential I was waiting for the curtain to be yanked back on advertising, it shown bare for the offensive beast that it is. Like with previous documentaries of this genre, you indulge the setup but are really waiting for the one-two punch to come and deliver the knockout. However that's not the story that's being told. It starts as Morgan talks to these sponsors and pitches them his ideas, as one would imagine the smart ones back off because they're not looking to have their image roughed up, and pay for it in the process. Eventually some willing brands do join on but as you're anticipating the movie will progress into something more you slowly realize that's not what's going to happen. Once the backers for the film are secured, the branding process is explained and Morgan proceeds to become sold. Yes there are some points here or there where he talks about the damage advertising is doing, and how we could better get along without it, but that's maybe a total of fifteen minutes of the films entirety. Perhaps I'm naive to think that he could get all this corporate backing and still beat them to death with the truth, but that's what I've come to expect from a Spurlock production. For him to lull the marks into a false sense of security only to be secretly be fighting ""the man"" the whole time. I came away with no real revelations of how the advertising companies worked, no great lessons were learned. He kept eluding to all these ""inner workings"" that he was being privy to, but the audience doesn't truly see any of that. Instead he does just what every other movie would do, he took the sponsors money, he stroked their ego, and that was it! Again yes there were a few jabs here or there, but nothing awe inspiring. I just felt the documentary was billed as film that exposed the evils of advertising bought and sold by the advertisers themselves. That the genius of it was, he was showing the audience how they were being duped and the people doing the duping were financing the actual ""dupe-age"" of themselves! As I said in the beginning, maybe this is Morgan's idea of irony, that instead of sticking it to them, he totally played along, and the true evil exposed is the documentary itself. While that's very poetic, it's just not what I was expecting. Either way I still gave it three stars for bringing some kind of light to the idea that media and advertising are manipulating society. At the end of the day that still remains a noble cause in my book. Watch the movie yourself and take from it what you may.",1315353600,8,2734,4.536437246963563
4471462,4,B004UXUVFW,"Like Michael Moore, documentarian Morgan Spurlock makes film which try to entertain as well as inform. Of course, these directors' films are subjective; the director showing you what they want to. I missed Spurlock's previous film, ""Super Size Me"", mainly because I understood some of the footage was fairly graphic. (This film is not graphic, but rated PG for a bit of adult language - sometimes from the CEO's of major corporations.)

I've always been fascinated by advertising and remember reading Vance Packard's classic book ""The Hidden Persuaders"" in 1957! Back then there was ""subliminal advertising"" but not as much ""product placement"" as there is today. Packard's book is mentioned in the film (actually in one of the ""deleted scenes"") by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. (This 5 minute deleted scene is one worth watching after you've seen the feature.) But Spurlock is out to talk about paid product placement and use that concept to fund his film. And he does. There are about six MAJOR funders - the largest (at $1million) is POM, with others like Ban Deodorant ($500,000), Hyatt Hotels and Cooper autos- who financed the film's production. Other reviewers may mention Maine & Tail Shampoo (a product that can be used by humans and horses equally) but - as you will see on the screen - that company did not pay for their inclusion in the film. The film does contain LOTS of other ad images and I'm not sure these companies contributed.

While I was drawn into the film at the beginning, it did drag a bit and might have been edited tighter. It's interesting to watch the original Theatrical Trailer included with the bonus features. Nearly all the footage from this 2- minute ""trailer"" appears in the first 20 minutes of the actual film! I also wondered if anyone else questioned how Spurlock could include what is presented to be a guest appearance by Spurlock on the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show promoting the film which Kimmel says ""opens this weekend"". Was this staged? Spurlock doesn't say but it obviously must be.

Spurlock did have access to some well known Hollywood and TV scriptwriters like John Wells and Quentin Tarantino (who says that products most folks think were purposely added to ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were not planned). And we learn that - surprise! - often writers are forced by a film or show's producers to insert product names in their scripts.

The other bonuses on the DVD include a Director Commentary (which I did not listen to), half a dozen outtakes, a few commercials that Spurlock created (Jet Blue, Hyatt), and a behind the scenes featurette. (But a behind-the-scenes at a film that is actually a behind-the-scenes is, well, redundant.)

If you have an interest in advertising you'll want to see this film. If you want to learn what the 21st Century version of ""The Hidden Persuaders"" is, you'll want to see this also. But, be prepared for few boring moments as well.

4471463,4,B004UXUVFW,"Often a D.V.D. of a movie includes a ""The Making of [Movie Title]"" as a bonus feature.  In his documentary THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER SOLD, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock efficiently delivers both the movie and the ""Making of"" feature all in the main title.  THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER SOLD depicts how companies pay to have their products and services prominently displayed in movies and television programs as  Spurlock asks airlines, hotels, beverage companies, and so on how much money they will give for their stuff appearing in the film he's making.

The late writer George Plimpton sometimes participated in the subjects he covered, for example writing about prize fighting by sparring with great boxers like Sugar Ray Robinson.  Give Morgan Spurlock credit for doing the same in THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER SOLD.  Spurlock could have merely identified movies and T.V. shows that sneak ads for sponsor products and services into the story and interview directors about the ethics of doing so.  But he takes it to the Plimpton level, telling the story by living it instead of just reporting from the front row.

4471464,4,B004UXUVFW,"""At what part do I just let myself completely become a foil to do everybody else's bidding?"" Morgan Spurlock sets out on a quest to make a movie about product placement in movies, paid for entirely by marketing for product placement. This is a documentary that is very funny and will make you think. The movie begins with Morgan very excited about getting the movie made and going from company to company asking them to sponsor him. Eventually, after the commitments are made the contracts come. Morgan goes from excited to worried about if he is losing control over his movie. This movie exposes the truths behind marketing in movies and exposes the control that companies have over even the littlest aspects of movie making. One of the most interesting scenes is when he visits the school in Florida and talks to them about marketing in schools. It really made me think that this may be a way to help with schools budget concerns. Overall, a very entertaining documentary that is very fun to watch. I really enjoyed this movie. I give it an A-.

4471465,1,B004UXUVFW,"When director/presenter Morgan Spurlock hit the promotion circuit several months ago, he said the point of this film would be to pull back the curtain and reveal the details of how product placement works in film, television and elsewhere.  Instead, he's delivered about 1 hour of commercials, 1 hour of negotiations with advertisers, but only about 4 minutes of information about how the product placement industry works outside of this one tiny atypical project.  Ultra-brief, usually single-sentence cameos from Noam Chomsky, J.J. Abrams and Ralph Nader are tantalizing glimpses into what this documentary might have been.

How is product placement set up for blockbuster films?  Do the advertisers approach the film studios, or the reverse?  To what degree are films like 2000's 'Cast Away' created ground-up as product placement vehicles before the screenplay is even written?  What percentage of total film revenues comes from product placement?  Are there any legal restrictions on product placements in the lyrics of pop music marketed to young people?  No matter what questions you have about the product placement industry, you can be sure this documentary won't provide answers.

There's only one actual fact in the film: ""Of the $412 billion spent annually on marketing & advertising, just 4 companies control over 75% of it (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis & Interpublic).""  Great... how much of that goes to product placement? 1%?  99%? The complete absence of any context that might give this figure relevance suggests that Spurlock is only pretend-interested in informing viewers.

Although Spurlock's advertising campaign includes graffiti of his face with the words ""Sell Out!,"" he is careful to hedge the question of whether he is ""really"" selling out.  The film closes with this rather dubious assertion of integrity: ""The full $1.5 million to produce this film came from sponsors.  None of them got final approval of the movie.""  ...Well, okay, but surely fulfilling the exacting sponsorship contracts in the editing booth is why we have to (for instance) sit through about 10 minutes of tiresome Jet Blue commercials but only get a fleeting 30 seconds of probably-would-have-been-fascinating interview with Quentin Tarantino, right?

This documentary might be good to get a discussion going, but you'll still need Wikipedia or an actual book on the subject to get even basic facts on the industry.  Spurlock is charming, but his ""I'm a corporate whore -- just kidding -- but not really"" shtick is best in small doses.  This made me wish there really was a documentary that provided the information Spurlock had promised on the talk shows, so I could watch that instead (the closest thing I've found is the fantastic series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Century-of-the-Self/dp/0930852753/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Century of the Self</a>&nbsp;by Adam Curtis, which tells the history of the invention of modern marketing by Freud's nephew; you can download the whole thing free from the Internet Archive).  After the first few minutes of novelty at the admittedly-interesting premise, ultimately 'The Greatest Movie Ever Sold' was like sitting through 2 hours of tiresome TV commercials, centered on the primary product we're being sold: not some juice drink, but Spurlock himself as a would-be (to use his term) maker of 'Docbusters.'  I came away from this film feeling like I'd been cheated by a bush-league confidence grifter.  Bleh.",1313020800,30,3502,5.4721189591078065
4471466,5,B004UXUVFW,"I absolutely loved this movie!  It is completely hilarious, caught my attention the entire movie, and I left the theater with a smile on my face.  I highly recommend this movie - I hope Morgan hits his $10,000,000 goal so that POM Wonderful will pay for their sponsorship of the movie.  In what other film will you see the filmmaker bathing a pony in a tub?",1306886400,5,357,4.378787878787879
4471467,5,B004UXUVFW,"I sat through Morgan Spurlock's The Greatest Movie ever sold with fascination, but when it concluded, I wondered where was the film? Spurlock's idea is ingenious. One that very few people could have dared, and pulled of. He makes a film about the difficulty of finding sponsors to give funding for a project. The film however is the mission to meet with sponsors and advertisers; in other words, this seems like a behind the scenes sort of preproduction of funding your project. The money  is going towards the film itself which IS the journey to get the funding. With commercials from official sponsors, one wonders if Spurlock himself is embracing the commercial enterprise. In other words, when does a spoof become to close to the subject it lampoons or critiques?

What I always enjoy about Spurlock, including here, is that even though he may disagree with advertising or the nutritional benefits of McDonalds, he appears for a large majority of his films as quite fair and balanced; unlike some people who from the get go detest their subject-*cough* Bill Maher. He actually gets in the game, calls countless companies and corporations for a deal, and gets rejected countless times for good reason. Not many companies would feel great about helping a film that is trying to demonstrate the intrusion of product placement in films. However, he eventually does get a good number of sponsors willing to spend from $25,000 to upwards of a million. Yet, the money is not delivered on the spot. There are countless contractual obligations that need to be followed so the rights of both sides are not compromised.

Morgan Spurlock is not Michael Moore. It's not that Moore is better or ruder than Spurlock, but that their styles differ. This shows for better and worse in this project. First of all, from Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, to the demanding people at POM, Spurlock is as respectful and cooperative as one can be. There is no sense of superiority on Spurlock's behalf. We get that this is a nice friendly guy. This helps to understand and enjoy Spurlock's point of view. However, what Spurlock is not is an adept interviewer. Noam Chomsky and Quentin Tarantino are fascinating subjects, for completely different reasons, but Spurlock asks them a question or two, and they are forgotten forever. He is inquisitive, but a Moore would push for more information, and really get down to the meat of the issue.

We all know that marketing, advertising, and product placement play a big role in the film business, but Spurlock shows it in its very extreme. He isn't revealing it, but he approaches the issue through film, knowing that advertising touches every section of art. Where it gets most unfortunate is when these corporate powers enters the school: an institution that should be devoid of corporation's reach. A big issue for Spurlock is whether this project will turn him in to a new man who embraces product placement in his work. For many, this may not be a problem, but for him it definitely seems to be.

Rather than being insightful, The Greatest Movie Ever Sold is passionate and funny coming from a man who cares about these issues, and deep-down obviously abhors advertising's intrusion in every part of our daily lives. A downside to the film is the ending. Unlike Supersize Me where one could come back with a moral or conclusion, such as ""don't eat frequently at McDonalds, till it goes bankrupt"" the conclusion of this work suggests there is no way to win against advertising. The only rescue to confide in nature to escape the wicked nature of today's ever increasing commercial world. There is no solution, but only a few routes of escape from such despicable activities. Many things don't get better with time, and it seems that advertising will only debase art more and more as time moves on.",1303776000,35,3817,4.848159509202454

4471614,4,B004UXUVFW,"I love documentaries and I fell in love with Spurlock with Super Size Me, but when this movie came around, I actually found myself incredibly hesitant to watch it (hence the 3 years it has taken me).  Part of it, Im sure, is based on how much I disliked his reality show 30 Days.  However, upon doing some deep personal reflection, I think the actual subject of the film itself was what had me so reluctant to watch it.  Even after it finally made it to the top of my Netflix queueI kept struggling with the idea to just cut it out of the pile, although the topic was (and is) something I found very interesting.

And actually, what I just said is not entirely accuratewhat put me off is how the movie was sold.  Because of its review of product placement and advertising processes utilized within Hollywood, it ended up being sold in the most obnoxious methods possible..and I found myself viewing this movie as though it were nothing more than a product shill

Im happy to say I was too lazy to hit the delete button from my Netflix DVD queue.

This film does exactly what it promises.  It shows you precisely what process almost every big movie today goes through and forces Spurlock to become that corporate spokesperson that we all hateeverything that we would see as being in direct opposition to what he is, at least from our exposure to him in his debut documentaryone would probably state that his most recent director-ship (a One Direction film) would probably change our minds about him as well (although I haven't seen the film, so I really shouldnt judge).

But this is the thing.  From everything I knew about this film through the advertisement of it up to actually watching it, I found myself absolutely despising Spurlock.  Here was this guy who, although I may question some of the techniques he used in his fast food movie, has this brilliantly snarky quality to his documentary films that I find myself rather adoring, that I believed sold out because of the way he sold this movie.

Yet, if you watch the movie, you find that was exactly the pointto show how one goes about selling out, and to ask the questionat what point do you actually sell out.  Of course, I realized this going in, but I still couldn't help having this tainted vision of the man, making it difficult to take this movie seriously.",1426723200,,2323,4.555288461538462

4471646,5,B004UXUVFW,"I saw this once and had to buy it. It is smart, funny and can be eye-opening to those less knowledgable about what goes on in the branding industry. I gave this to a pre-teen to wake them up to what they are consuming and it worked for the better. Spurlock is both funny and keeps it light while also educating people about how much influence the companies that are household names control what goes into making movies they back and how much control they exert. The teens who saw it loved it, so this is a very approachable documentary with great production values.

Kudos to the companies that had the guts to back him. I made it a point after to let each one know that their willingness to peel bak they veil is why I have at least tried their products (still not rich enough to try a Mini). And not surprisingly, those companies tend to actually have quality products since they can stand the scrutiny Spurlock shines on them. Also, it was vey cool on Mane and Tail to allow one of Spurlocks best jokes Still waiting for that great POM commercial Morgan pitched but was shot down.

He does show a town that has outlawed advertising outside, that is interesting.  He shows school districts that allow advertising on their buses and around ball games as a revenue stream.",1387152000,,458,4.675

Morgan Spurlock goes to great lengths to show just how hard it is to get a film funded, and how much b.s. comes along with corporate sponsorship.",1364515200,,300,4.4363636363636365
4471694,4,B004UXUVFW,"There may not be a point to this Morgan Spurlock documentary other than the obvious fact that sales-based corporations market and advertise themselves in all sorts of ways, but it sure is entertaining watching him illustrate the point. And it's not as obvious as you might think, in the sense that the general public is so bombarded with plugs; they've become such a normal part of our lives; that we tend to overlook them. They just sort of blend-in with everything else. So when he takes us to So Paulo, Brazil, a city in which the mayor has banned all public advertising, it looks like some sort of weird ghost town, a place I wouldn't want to live.

That's because, with a few annoying exceptions like internet pop-ups and people stopping me on the streets, I don't mind companies trying to sell me things. It's an effortless way to discover new products I might find useful or otherwise like. Whether they're psychologically manipulating my brain ""activity"" or not, I don't feel as if I'm being taken advantage of because it's ultimately my choice whether to buy in or not. The fun tone Spurlock presents as he goes around meeting with different executives to sponsor his ""Movie""; the fourth-wall-collapsing irony is that a documentary about ads is funded by ads; suggests he'd agree with me.

One caution... you might expect a documentary to be a totally G-rated experience... there are a couple of times that the satire makes a pretty blunt ""anatomical"" reference with verbal and line-drawing explanation.  Not pornographic.  But did require explanation to my 9 year old.  Oops lol

But not for me. I got my new copy, couldn't get through the previews so I took that DVD, which was attempting to take control of this consumer's life, and threw it right into the trash. Great Movie, however, the company that distributed this DVD has many ""coming attractions"" on the front that can not be negotiated through. THAT company sucks to high heaven. Too bad.

4471747,4,B004UXUVFW,"I liked this from ""go."" Speaking of, that band holding up their ads WHILE they're talking WAS and IS selling out. I do like the urinal cakes advertising the film. Funny is always clever, if you ask me. I wish Johnny cash had let the song ""ring of fire"" be used for the hemorrhoid commercial. It's the most shoplifted product, actually. By the way, the band in question has a VERY annoying song for the film. Just my opinion. It's been proven that it's easier to con or manipulate someone if you're laughing. That was in an article by Teller of Penn and Teller. I personlly don't mind advertising IF it's at least funny, and an option--NOT something you have to see forced on you. Great commercials are always availible online, people WANT to see them. They go LOOK for them. My personal issue lies when the product sucks. Or when you're watching a show, and they say IN THE DIALOG, ""oh, well, I couldn't do it without such-and-so"", and NO ONE would say that in real life.

I liked this movie from the start. It passed the five minute rule, which any film should be able to fulfill. It should also grab you from any point even from the midlle. It's all very toungue in cheek, so YEAH, there is advertising, BUT we are in on the joke. That's what it's about. Duh. It all boils down to ""Was I entertained."" Yes. So, there you go. I like that Mane n Tail had a great sense of humor about the movie. I passed up several movies to watch this one, War Horse, Pirate Radio, something with Jim Carrey, oh, fun with Dick and Jane; that didn't pass the five-minute rule. I was bored. Bored, bored BORED. I wasn't bored watching this. Thank you for reading. It couldv'e lost a few minutes time-wise, but it's passable.",1354924800,,1706,4.39873417721519

4471750,5,B004UXUVFW,"I saw this movie in the theatre and loved it. Couldn't wait for it to come out in DVD. Bought 2. One for a friend and one for me.

Mr. Spurlock's take on how a movie raises money is ""transparent"". When you see a movie, you see a box of some product. The company that makes that product pays a sum to the producers for the product to be seen.

Mr. Spurlock went all out and called it. The whole move is ""sponsor driven"" and his humorous dialogue and filming of the process is hysterical.

Love this film - Also liked his previous documentary ""Super Size Me"".",1345161600,,557,4.186915887850467
4471799,4,B004UXUVFW,"Generally speaking, one could make a better documentary about product placement in the movies ('product placement' - to make us - gullible and susceptible viewers spend money, and feed the consumerism), having more actual footage to make a better and more thorough point. And, this one seems boring at times.
But, overall, the benefit of it is to make YOU aware that even movies are places for billboards, and commercials do NOT stop when movie starts.
If you clever, and insightful, you probably see for yourself product placement going on already. But, this movie shows a bit how it's done from the inside of the trade.
All in all 3-4 stars. Not great, but not very bad.

4471800,3,B004UXUVFW,"I like Morgan Spurlock and his approach to making documentaries but this one misses the mark. While it's definitely watchable and has interesting parts, the film inadvertently becomes guilty of doing the same things that it criticizes mainstream movies for doing.

It's a neat idea to have corporate sponsors pay for the production of the movie but the problem is that it takes over the entire documentary. Literally 80-90% is Morgan seeking out advertisers and only a tiny fraction covers the premise of the title.

So how much does corporate sponsorship influence Hollywood? Are advertisers drawn to scripts or are scripts written entirely to promote certain products? What is the agenda? All of these are great questions the film teases us with but never really answers in any detail. And that's a shame since it's a fascinating topic and Morgan Spurlock should be been the perfect guy to expose product placement practices.",1337299200,2,927,5.092105263157895

Unlike Supersize me, this movie simply restates the fact that ads are all around us, in an uncreative and unneccessary manner. The whole time i was wondering ""Duh"", this stuff is so obvious, and cant claim to learn anything.
