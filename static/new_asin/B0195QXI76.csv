7563203,5,B0195QXI76,"Incredible story of how music is so effective in treating a litany of both physical and mental problems. The music of New Orleans is featured in this film, which adds to its charisma. Always a pleasure to watch Joaquim de Almeida and Aunjanue Ellis deserves and Oscar for her portrayal of a woman suffering from Alzheimer's. Everyone should see this great movie!",1458172800,5,362,4.854838709677419
7563204,5,B0195QXI76,"Who would have expected a musical with Alzheimer's as a theme?  But it works and the result is a great film.  A doctor harbors guilt because he was unable  to save his mother who died of dementia-related  issues.  By chance, he meets a New Orleans street singer who suffers from Alzheimer's.  The doctor takes her  under his wing  using music as  therapy.  Fine performances, good music, and a touching story -- this is one of the most underrated films of the recent past.",1456876800,3,472,4.578313253012048

7563262,3,B0195QXI76,"I usually think it's incredibly unfair to rate a movie you ""walk out"" on, but guilty as charged:  I tuned out after about 45 minutes.  Having seen my father through Alzheimer's, I could tell that this was yet another movie about the attractive decline of attractive people (and they are -- she's absolutely beautiful, and he's got that Javier Bardem, Jean-Paul Belmondo, life-beaten faces), rather than the harrowing disintegration of a person from someone you know and love to someone reduced to barely basic sentience.  If you're going to go there (and no one's holding a gun to your head to broach the topic) I prefer learning a valuable life lesson rather than indulging a screenwriter's fantasy about a feel-good twilight-of-life story.  Some life experiences, unfortunately, are simply unbearable, yet we bear them.  If you want to know what film can tell you about this stage of life, check out ""Amour.""  If you want to tell pretty stories of pretty people that don't help me understand the human condition, sell your tickets to someone else, thanks.",1465084800,2,1057,4.9772727272727275

We think it will never happen to us, but, yikes; we know there's a possibility and that is dreadful to ponder.  This film is a little slow, but worth the time spent.",1460851200,,253,4.229166666666667
7563319,5,B0195QXI76,"Absolutely wonderful movie, I was looking for a movie with no sex, or profanity and happened upon this one, really heart warming and also informing on the effects of Alzheimer's on not just the person but those around. Came away from this movie with awesome sense of better understanding and how certain things done can help the person and families to cope. and have hope. Recommend this to anyone.",1460764800,6,398,4.782608695652174
7563320,4,B0195QXI76,"A nice movie good acting. Heartbreaking. And in reality a street women with Alzheimer's at this level would most likely end up in a nursing facility rather than assisted living, which is very expensive. And unless her family is rich it would probably be a state run nursing facility which are for the most part not such good places to end up in. Heartbreaking indeed.",1460764800,4,367,4.661538461538462
7563321,5,B0195QXI76,A great film with a rare but close view of Alzheimer's disease. It's educational as well as delightful. Highly recommended,1460678400,,122,5.15

7563324,5,B0195QXI76,"Of Mind And Music is a MUST SEE and MUST SHARE film.  The cast delivers stellar performances and Adams captures the nuance and authenticity of the heartbreaking progression of Alzheimer's Disease, the struggle & pain of the afflicted, their loved ones, and the scientists and physicians racing against time to find a cure.  The beautiful cinematography and soulful score bring New Orleans and her Music alive so that they become characters themselves.  Keep tissues nearby - tears will likely flow as this very human and very relevant story unfolds.

Like his character, author (of the book on which the film is based) and co-writer, Dr Nicolas Bazan, is a renowned Neuroscientist with a love of music and an insatiable drive to conquer neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia.  Dr. Bazan MD/PhD is the founder and director of the Neuroscience Center of Excellence at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans.  Not surprisingly, he is donating 70% of his profit from sales of the film to fund research specifically focused on AD.  One would like to think that with the alarming prevalence of AD, there would be ample funding for such important research, but that is not the case.

Of Mind And Music stands on its own as an outstanding indie.  The fact that a portion of profits from film sales will go directly to research - to the front lines of science - is just the icing on the cake!  It's a win, win.  Another reason we must share this film and this story!",1460246400,,1502,4.828125

7563326,5,B0195QXI76,"This movie is a love letter to the City of New Orleans and her culture wrapped in a medical mystery. Actors in this movie are all wonderful and give very caring performances. I would recommend this movie if you love the city, it's music and culture, just our vibe. The story is about a woman who has Alzheimer's disease and can't remember most things but she remembers her music and comes alive when she is performing it on the street. Of Mind and Music will take your emotions on a thrill ride as you go with the main character down memory lane to discover her long-lost son.

He is troubled by personal experiences happening in front of his eyes, as well as one from his past. A once brilliant jazz performer is now hanging on to her sanity by a thread made of music.

7563332,5,B0195QXI76,"A masterpiece, deftly combining a compelling story with a powerful message.  As the son of a victim of Alzheimers' disease, I am thrilled to see a film that is engrossing, entertaining, and extremely well directed and acted telling the reality of this global madaly.  The cast is superb, and the gentle pace and ambiance of the story, which features beautiful music intertwined with scenes of the real New Orleans, is interwoven in a delicious recipe of storytelling.

7563333,5,B0195QXI76,"This was very enjoyable. Amazing directing that allows us to see what it would be like to be so afflicted. I don't remember in any other movie I've ever seen where you could put yourself so squarely inside the mind of someone who is just a shell of who they once were, yet at the same time retaining the soul of their craft which wasn't lacking even til the end. Makes you wonder about interacting with someone with dementia. They will seem like no one is ""home"" but there must be an unexpressed spark still burning inside them that I wish they could somehow articulate.",1459468800,4,570,4.438095238095238
8744097,2,B0195QXI76,"I'm not getting mushy over some Alzheimer's theme, the movie basically sucked.  The entire movie seemed meaningless except to display an Alzheimer's victim - screw  that.  Mr. Alzheimer should have written a song to go with the disease at least.  Acting was blaze', dialogue insignificant, four characters to the entire movie; and talk about a slow paced movie.
And about Alzheimer's, it will never be cured while a health care system makes big bucks keeping everyone sick.  Remember:  ""You are what you eat"" is not just a saying, it's the truth.  If you get a disease, stop crying about it or surrendering to it, or feeling like some martyr, but become saintly in what you put into your body, go Alkaline for the most part, no simple carbs, no table salt, no sugar, no grains, no pastas and breads; eat plenty of nuts, veggies, fruits, organic everything, blend raw smoothies daily, study Health as you eat properly and you may actually heal anything.",1526169600,,952,4.803680981595092
