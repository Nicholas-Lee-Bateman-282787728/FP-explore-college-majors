8135182,4,B000GYI26O,"Season 1 of the Heads Up Championship was very good; this one is a small step down. Although the format is still the same and the production quality is excellent again, the producers of the show decided to profile the ""personalities"" of the game more than the poker. Although they may have made the same choices as in season 1, they seemed to have focused on the eventual winner much less in this series.

If you follow poker you know Ted Forrest is somewhat of a mythical and legendary player around the biggest games in the world. Unfortunately, because he has less personality than say a Phil Hellmuth or Daniel Negraneau, they didn't give him as much of the spotlight as they did for Hellmuth's win last year. I think it detracts slightly from the overall set because Forrest is one of the best in the world at all forms of poker and they shortchanged the viewers somewhat. Also I think they highlight too many all in hands and not as many of the jab and weave type hands that help you get in the heads of the best players. I for one don't like seeing mostly showdown poker.

I still enjoyed the set and I love heads up poker so it is still worth buying. This is a 4 DVD set so it is also a good value.",1157932800,8,1206,4.262008733624454
