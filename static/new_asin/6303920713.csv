727569,4,6303920713,this movie was great. it had great acting by the kids who played the students as well as michelle pfeiffer. i really liked this movie to the point where i own it on vhs and dvd. this movie is special because it was based on a school in my hometown.,982281600,,248,3.98
727570,3,6303920713,"Well first of all Michelle Pfeiffer was good as Lou Anne Johnson. She comes across as very genuine. There there could have been a bit more drama in the film. I found the film a bit unrealistic and the storyline was a bit far fetched. Some of the swearing in the film was unesscarcery. I feel the film could have been a really big hit but it lacked depth and it needed to be more realistic. Apart from these factors I thought it was brilliant, it had comedy, humour sadness, enjoyment. All the nessarcary ingredients for a great film. B ut some how I don't think it came togehter. The other actors in this film such as Courtney B Vance did an excellent job. They portrayed thier characters very well. T his film is suitable for most people.",980899200,,739,4.36231884057971
727571,3,6303920713,"An ex marine takes the challenging position as an English teacher at a tough inner city school where she confronts raucous students who don't want to learn. Not as good as i'd expected with the casting of the capable Michelle Pfieffer in the leading role but is defintley worth a look and at best can be described as entertaining, with a few interesting sub plots along the way. Its not really origanal with its typical fantasy, feel good factor about the tough being tamed, but boasts some good performances and some scenes are genuinley moving. Purley judged on its own merits, its good and worth a look. Recommended.",970790400,,619,4.7407407407407405
727572,2,6303920713,"Michelle Pfeiffer who is very talented and very beautiful failed to move me here as an ex-marine who becomes an English Teacher at an tough inner-city school where she confronts freaks and viloent students who don't want to learn. The message here is the fact that kids who are mouthy and think that they are tough have a right to do what they want, kind of stupid to see this film now and think it would actually make an impact on today's youth, with it's bland and unbelivable wish fullfilment. I don't see how poetry can tame tough,restive delinquents. Half hour into the film you will feel dissallusined on why you rented this video, and by the end you will throw the VCR or DVD out the window with the movie follwing behind it. Now that's a dangerous mind.",970617600,,761,4.482014388489208
727573,5,6303920713,"i really liked this movie.it really explains the life of teenagers like that class in this movie,sometimes they get shot at and theres a lot of fights and everything.one of the kids gets shot at so thats a sad  part. Michelle Pfeiffer had to have won an award for this movie for best  acting.",958694400,,292,4.388888888888889
727574,4,6303920713,"Dangerous Minds was a very good movie although the story line was a little predictable. It showed real kids with real problems. It also shows that all it takes is for someone to actually care about kids like that and they can  change. There was a lot of foul language and although that's how kids talk,  they could have done without it. I like how the writers had Michelle P's  character constantly talk about choices. She showed how everything we do  and say is our choice. We may not have choices that we like (which she  stated) but everything in life is a choice. Good movie for all (especially  students).",955411200,6,610,4.5
727575,5,6303920713,This is a very goods movie> It shows what teenagers are really goin through with nowa days. It it's not just in the ghettos It everyweares even in my neighbor hood. You cant esven go to school without getting shot at.  What is this world coming to,932860800,,247,4.25531914893617

727780,5,6303920713,This is one of those movies that warms my heart and makes my eyes water no matter how many times I watch it! This easily stands on the shelf next to other great inspirational movies that speak to the heart of a teacher. It was this teacher's love for her students and their success that moved them to believe what she believed no matter the personal struggles they were dealing with at home. This was a well acted emotional film that really showed the obstacles teachers AND students must overcome to become successful in the world they live in. Some people may not watch this film because of it's rating but please do not allow that to stop you from seeing it. This film had to be rated R in order to truly capture  an inner city school with very real everyday struggles. This film is a classic!,1500249600,,796,4.378378378378378

Being a school teacher striving to ensure her charges get a chance was uplifting. This was a strong performance, and the story line centred within providing education ticked off a couple of boxes for me. I can thoroughly recommend this film.",1481241600,,344,4.8474576271186445

The problem is that there isn't anything really special here, and the film doesnt try to do anything but repeat the tried and true formula of giving the teacher a backbone and heart that others didn't have and so the film winds up feeling very generic.  Yes, it is based on actual events, but so are the countless other films following this formula and so it begs the question, why tell more than one of these true stories?

729146,3,6303920713,"WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS.

I AM a teacher.  Most of my students ARE from the urban, inner-city environment. I DO relate to this movie quite well.  HOWEVER, as good of a movie as this is, the writers came up short...literally.

We get to see just a glimpse into Ms. Johnson's (played wonderfully by Michelle Pfeiffer) experience teaching and dealing with the students.  That glimpse was not enough.  Too many things were not given any form of closure by the end of the movie.  It seems to me that the 99 minutes was NOT enough to give this movie the time it needed.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen Ms. Johnson's character take-on the principal, Mr. Grandey, and win.  We needed some closure with his out-of-touch ways of running the school.  After all, if he DID allow Emilio (played by Wade Dominguez) to speak to him, Emilio may not have been killed.  Another important part that was needed but missing, was the GRADUATION.  Instead, we get a movie that builds up our passion but slams the door way too soon as the ending credits roll. George Dzundza's character, Hal Griffith, was unnecessary and did not offer us much.

This movie COULD have had the impact of Dead Poets Society if only there was the viewer's satisfaction of seeing Mr. Grandey get fired or demoted.  As mentioned, seeing the students take some sort of final exam or standardized test that showed how much Pfeiffer's character helped her students to graduate, would have been one of the most joyful, yet tear-jerking part of this movie.  Everything didn't have to end up all peaches and cream happy, but, bottom line is, at least to me, the movie needed more closure.

As an instructor, I'd give this movie an ""I"" for ""INCOMPLETE,"" but with potential for a solid ""A.""",1362528000,2,1757,4.69281045751634

729282,4,6303920713,"The only reason why I gave this 4 stars- is because they left a lot open-ended.  Once Michelle Pfeiffer really started reaching out to the students and it started working, it seemed to fast forward to them having to take another class because now they were honors students. The movie takes a long time to build up in the beginning.

As soon as I put this DVD on, and it started up, I remembered all the characters instantly. I even remembered what happened in the movie.

But really, there's nothing new here that hasn't been done a thousand times before, and better. The story is pretty generic, and is almost a direct copy of what happens in Sister Act 2. Even the cast look pretty similar. A former marine comes in to teach the 'bad' kids, who have managed to be unteachable up until now. She teaches them karate (without actually touching them of course), teaches them a few choice phrases about choosing or wanting to die, and boom, she's the best teacher ever.

The kids are pretty stereotypical too, there's the choice bad guy, with the girlfriend who wants to protect him, the other bad guy who wants to be bad, but has a good family behind him and all the other stereotypes you can think of. Any fans of Hackers will recognise Renoly Santiago from that. What's shocking is that Wade Dominguez, who played Emilio (the bad guy), actually died at the age of 32 in 1998, from respiratory failure. I couldn't believe it when I read that.

The only real lasting impression that Dangerous Minds will leave you with is the song that was everywhere when it was out ""Gangster's Paradise"". Otherwise, it's pretty forgettable.",1218326400,2,1468,4.570342205323194

She was just one more person who walked out on them.  The real heroes in education are those who stay in the fight with their students, managing to balance their passion for education and dedication to their students with the necessary evil of jumping through beaurocratic hoops.

I remember, eerily enough, when this movie came out in 1995.  Coolio's ""Gangsta's Paradise"" came out in August of that year and was an instant hit, topping the Billboards for two, three months straight.  I was only 13 then.

The movie itself was really good.  The acting was great and the depiction of inner-city life was stellar.  I thought it was a shame that it was only given two stars by the Movie Rating Association, but what do they know?

Everyone gets to make choices in life regardless of their situation.  One must have the drive and ambition to make the right ones.  One line that Ms. Johnson has in the film is the response to one student's statement ""If we get on the bus, we have to put up with you!""  She responds, ""Yes, but that is still a choice.  You can either [stay where you're at] or get on that bus.  That may be a choice you don't like but that's still a choice.  There are no losers in this classroom.""

I also like her line of ""As of right now, everyone in here has an 'A'.  It's up to you to keep it.""",1193356800,7,1111,4.1745283018867925

Please come back to us Michelle, we love your incredible work. Dangerous Minds is kind of like To Sir with Love, Stand and Deliver and Blackboard Jungle but with a better plot and ending.

Former US Marine (Michelle Pffeifer) joins the teaching profession with oodles of idealism, hoping to mould young minds. The rest of the film proceeds to show the challenges she has to surmount to win over a group of underprivileged, mostly black kids, and to convince them that they have options in life. The plot has the potential to be very tired. That's why this DVD sat on my shelf for years, and I never had any incentive to pick it up. When I finally did, the film surprised me with its powerful, emotional acting and characterization. It also imparted some good values without coming across as preachy. In terms of depth, it was also much better than Mona Lisa Smile, or Music of The Heart (both of the same genre).

It carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief, but fall short of both aims.  I actually groaned in response to the predictability, and shuttered at the stereotypes, which were mentioned in another review.  At best, stereotypes of ignorant, aggressively dangerous, and perpetually struggling African and Hispanic American students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable, blue eyed, blonde-haired European American belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive.  At worst, these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring.  This movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both. Further, it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial, societal, and economic issues, which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for.",1127692800,8,955,5.389261744966443

On the other hand, if you have no life experience, are very young or simply have watched very few movies in your life, you might get some enjoyment out of this. It's not really a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one.",1127433600,7,555,4.388349514563107

729635,2,6303920713,"Dangerous Minds (John N. Smith, 1995)

That longtime director John N. Smith has such an anonymous name is a kind of poetic irony, in that no one remembers any of his films. Except, that is, Dangerous Minds, and the only reason they remember that one is because it has a really great main title, supplied by Coolio (Billboard chart-topper ""Gangsta's Paradise"").

You've seen this movie a thousand times before; that it's based on a more recent piece of nonfiction does not in any way downplay it's overt similarities to movies going all the way back to Boys Town. Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer, the movie's real gem) is an ex-drill sergeant in the Marines taking on her toughest assignment: a class full of troubled high school kids. Her ally is old friend Hal Griffith (Law and Order's George Dzundza, who does what he can with what he's got, which isn't much), and her enemy is the school principal, George Grandey (Law and Order: Criminal Intent's Courtney B. Vance), who despite being based on a nonfictional character is the essence of the two-dimensional Evil Nemesis(TM). Caught in the middle are the kids themselves, whom Johnson is forced to manipulate into wanting to learn. Some of the kids (most of whom were acting in their first film, and have not acted since) give surprising turns of flair in this movie, but in all honesty they're not enough to warrant going out of your way to watch this. Andy Garcia (cast for the movie, but whose scenes were cut before release) may have been able to spice this up; he steals every film he appears in, or did back when this came out. As it stands, it's something you've seen so many times before that by the very predictable end, you find yourself asking ""is that really all there is?"" **",1096502400,10,1745,4.680781758957655

729637,5,6303920713,"While about the only inner city experience I had was working in Buffalo for a couple of months, I did enjoy this movie. If you didn't catch it in the opening, it is based on a true story, and that in and of itself is an awesome testimony of hope. I think that Louanne Johnson would ask for no sympathy being a former Marine. I remember seeing this movie the year after I graduated and enjoying the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"" by rapper, Coolio. It was a major status symbol that made this movie great. That was almost 10 years ago. Today, I find myself having a major problem with that song. Listen to the lyrics closely enough, and it appears that Coolio is plain feeling sorry for himself, bathing himself in self pity. That, in my opinion, contradicts the movie by saying, ""I am nothing more than a victim of circumstances."" Boo-hoo-hoo!! I don't know how many jobs I've been fired from, only to dust myself off and get another one. You are only a victim if you make yourself a victim.
Michelle Pfeiffer played an awesome role, the encourager. You take a close look at the role of Courtney Vance as the principal, the one who wants you to knock before entering and you can't help but ask a simple question, ""Is he a prick, or a piller of society?"" He almost falls into a neutral category for me because of who he is, and his definition of tough love is not something everyone agrees with.

By making your own choices, you choose the path of your own life... even if you give in and allow someone else to make those choices, that was your choice, too.
There's a lot of rough language, and rough characters... but a much more believable storyline than other movies of this same type.  It seems all it takes is one person to care to make a difference, where others may see no light.
