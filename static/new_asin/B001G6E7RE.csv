3597054,3,B001G6E7RE,"I was a little frustrated because the day it shipped all the local stores had it priced alot less. The product itself is great entertainment. Just unhappy about the price being substaintially more than local retailers. Should have waited for release, preorder wasn't the best idea in this case. I returned it to Amazon, as always the refund process was effortless. My local retailer gladly accepted my cash and movie night went off without a hitch.",1229126400,,448,4.907894736842105
3597055,5,B001G6E7RE,The video showed up the day of release - perfect.  My son has watched this movie 10 times already.,1227916800,,98,4.157894736842105
3597056,5,B001G6E7RE,"I LOVE this movie!  It has a great theme that when you are called, if you believe, you can do it.  FAITH!",1227830400,,105,3.727272727272727
3597057,4,B001G6E7RE,"This is a great movie, but I have a beef with the packaging.  I accidentally bought the full frame version of this at Best Buy because there is no obvious difference between that and the widescreen version.  It needs to have Full Frame or Widescreen across the top, not in small letters on the spine.  I'm having so many issues with two disc special editions being out of stock on the day of release in stores, I'm probably going to just get my DVDs from Amazon from now on.  At least that way I'll know I'll get widescreen when I want to pick widescreen.",1226448000,3,555,4.3076923076923075
3597058,4,B001G6E7RE,"The Furious Five disk was a bit of a letdown.  Much of the animation in the featurette (not a full blown feature) was not the usual high quality animation.  Flashbacks were told in a different style of animation.  Just not up to expectations of the main movie.  Also, even if you get the fullscreen version of Kung Fu Panda, it seems as though the Furious Five disk is in widescreen (at least mine was).  And, I should add that the price on Amazon.com was NOT as good as other places on the release date.",1226188800,11,504,4.319148936170213
3597059,5,B001G6E7RE,MY NEPHEW NICK WAS THRILLED TO GET THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.  WHAT KID WOULDN'T LOVE IT. GREAT PRICE ALSO!,1230595200,,100,4.555555555555555
3597060,5,B001G6E7RE,I had to watch the movie repeatedly. I weaned myself down to just watching certain scenes - the ones that made me laugh - prior to going to sleep. Quick way of relaxing.,1230076800,,169,4.151515151515151
3597061,5,B001G6E7RE,this is great to keep your children very busy watching tv while you want to do some housework or just alone time and loving the characters. my daughter loved them.,1230076800,,163,4.466666666666667
3597062,5,B001G6E7RE,We went on vacation this summer and while there stopped to take in a few movies. This was one of them. Any movie that keeps 4 kids aged 5-10 still for so long the very first time they see a movie in a theater is worth it to me. I love Jack Black and my youngest is into anything Panda-oriented. What a great movie!,1229904000,,314,3.921875
3597063,5,B001G6E7RE,"Fun movie, excellent price and definately a great gift for kids of any age.  I bought 2 sets, one for me and one for a friend.  The friends have watched theirs a dozen times or more and my copy got hijacked by my brother's family and I haven't laid eyes on it since...they love it.",1229385600,,281,4.090909090909091

3597066,4,B001G6E7RE,"""Kung Fu Panda"" is entertaining, better than most Dream Works fare, and stands up to repeated viewing. ""Secrets Of The Furious Five"" is rather lightweight, and in a cheaper style of animation, but my 8-year-old likes it, and is delighted there is ""more"" to the story.",1229212800,,267,4.826086956521739

8304075,5,B001G6E7RE,"Kung Fu Panda is a terrific movie - funny, cute, winsome and inspiring, all in one. Jack Black fully animates ""The Big Fat Panda"" and we enjoy seeing him fulfill his life long dreams. Po stands for ""every person"" in his or her quest to achieve more than would seem possible, to the benefit of the world and personal honor.
I also purchased the ""Secrets of the Furious Five"" and would not recommend it - not worth the extra cost.",1232928000,,428,4.3625
