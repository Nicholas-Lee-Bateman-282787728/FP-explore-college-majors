8091038,5,B000BQ5IWI,"I have to say that I love this movie!  Throughout this movie I am envisioning myself living there under those circumstances.  Bleak, freezing cold, no money, no real quality of life or future, probably very little food, but thank God for the Vodka. As compared to life in the US and a lot of opportunity to have whatever you want ---- it is quite a contrast.  This movies is humorous and sweet. I did find myself genuinely cracking up in some scenes. Needless to say the intermittent horse drive by ----- I found hilarious.",1418688000,,523,4.542553191489362

8091041,4,B000BQ5IWI,"Kurdish director Hiner Saleem sets this bleakly humorous story in an Armenian village in the depths of winter. It's a vision of post-Soviet life, where unemployment is widespread, money is scarce, and vodka is plentiful. In a cockeyed world where quirky  is the norm, a musician is towed to a funeral in a bed (see DVD cover), people sit on chairs in snowdrifts to have conversations, the lemon vodka of the title actually tastes like almonds (because it's Armenia, someone explains), at unexpected moments a man on a horse races by, and a piano turns out to be self-propelled. Meanwhile, a widower and a widow begin a tentative relationship. A daughter is given in marriage to a man who is not what he seems. A bus driver sings along with his radio.

In Saleem's world, there is no exit and few prospects. Devotion to the dead provides what seems to be the only connection to what may have been a more prosperous past; the rooms of houses empty as belongings and furniture are literally carried off to be sold in town for a few dollars. A young woman turns to prostitution. A son who has somehow escaped and is living in Paris is no better off. There are finally only small but life-affirming moments of camaraderie, generosity, celebration, and the warmth of the occasional shot of vodka.

I enjoyed this film for its portrayal of humor in the midst of hopelessness. A spring thaw begins to set in at the end - and, who knows, maybe things won't get worse.",1247875200,2,1458,4.6
8091042,5,B000BQ5IWI,"For anyone who loves foreign movies, this one cannot be missed.  Made by Iraqi Kurd director, this film pictures life in one of the former Soviet Republics.  Mix of Russian, Armenian and French language gives another dimension to this wonderfully thought out film.  We see day to day life in the small village in Armenia where people try their best just to stay alive.  Most of them are unemployed and the only way to get any money is to sell off a little bit of life possessions that they have.  We see two people, an older widower, who overcomes his misery of daily existance by visiting regularly his wife's grave.  A beautiful widow does the same and on their trips to the cemetary, they get to know each other on the local bus.  Without giving away much about the plot, this film gives a picture of life in one of the remote places where there is no hope left.  Men are unemployed, women are treated as a property of their husbands and there is no sight of any improvement.  How can a person retain their dignity in that kind of society?  This film will show you at elast how they try to do that.  I hope to see more movies from this young, talented director in the future.",1197417600,3,1178,4.3577981651376145
8091043,5,B000BQ5IWI,"In the shivering cold climate of Northern Armenia is a small Kurdish village whose economy is negatively impacted by the break up of the Soviet Union. In this film, the viewer vicariousluy experiences village life in this remote part of the world. The film reveals how human beings  overcome adversity and create meaningful lives. The film is a testament to the Kurds and Armenian people whose spirit and love of life is shown in its best light, even in this harsh climate and despite serious economic disadvantages. The characters are phenomenal. Hamo is a grandfather-like wirey muscular man with white hair. He often visits his deceased wife at the cemetery. It is noted that people often carry  folded stools which they use at the bus stop (if there is no bench) or to sit on at the graveside. It is a customary in the region to speak to the dead as if they are still among us. Hamo tells her their son Kamo lives in Alfortville, France and is doing well (not entirely true, as he has no job yet). Weekly when he takes the bus to the cemetery, he sees the beautiful widow, Nina, who makes the same trip to the same place. She visits her deceased husband. Hamo notices she does not pay the busfare and the bus driver gives her credit until she can afford to pay. The bus driver plays a romantic French cassette almost each time as the two lone passengers ride to their destination ...

Hamo receives a short letter from his son who sends a photo of himself and his new French girlfriend. Hamo had expected him to send money. Money is in short supply. The Soviet Union had provided gas, electricity and other necessities to the village free or at nominal cost but now the villagers must fully pay for these commodities. There is no industry. Most of the villagers tend sheep or travel to a larger town or city to work ... Hamo talks to a portrait of his wife and explains he will have to sell a wardrobe (cabinet) to make some money. He takes the item on his back and parks it out on the main road. A married couple who passby inquire about its price for their daughter who is getting married. Negotiations begin and they haggle back and forth until a price is agreed upon. Hamo ends up selling a television set and also an old Army uniform to get more money. He has plans to win over Nina and also there is the wedding of his granddaughter ...

Nina has a job selling ""Vodka Lemon"" which is a bottled drink sold at a kiosk, a refreshment stand, near the main highway. Unfortunately business is not good and toward the end of the film, the owner closes the business entirely citing lack of customers. She has a daughter who plays the piano and works at a hotel for tips (although later we learn she earns money in ways other than tips). Their family income is very meager. After Hamo sold his items, he pays the busfare owed by Nina. This kind gesture opens up communication between them. Nina visits Hamo's home and they dance to a tune on the radio as their relationship warms up. In another scene, Hamo invites Nina to the wedding of his granddaughter. The wedding feast is superbly captured on camera. The feeling and mood are well conveyed. Two sheep are slaughtered for the guests consumption. An Armenian traditional band plays music and a female singer serenades the married couple. The wedding banquet is set up outside. There is a long table made up with a tablecloth and dishes ... all of it is out in the cold snow. The married couple sit on chairs on a stage. The wedding reception realistically portrayed and is one of the highlights in the film. Other unique perspectives are the cinematic views of the landscape and  the village. We learn this was an arranged marriage with a promise made by the groom to find a job for the father-in-law. There were unexpected dire consequencs for the groom when he failed to keep his end of the bargain/promise. The beginning and ending of the film use pieces of furniture to convey meaning within the scenes, each item represents something important and symbolic. It captures the viewer's attention and creates a continuity and closure to the film. Sadly, Nina ends up selling her daughter's piano ... but it is done for the right reasons and everyone involved is in harmony with this decision. It is very clear that both Hamo and Nina are willing to sacrifice some things of importance to themselves to build a life together. This is a most unusual and delightful film highly engaging and a total pleasure to view. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",1163548800,10,4498,4.555006180469715
8091044,3,B000BQ5IWI,"When one views a film like this, one realizes that Hollywood produces pure crap, pardon the expression.  So much money is spent on actors and special effects, etc., that little if any attention is given to the simple art of movie-making.

This movie, filmed in a remote, isolated village in post-Soviet Armenia, is about families and death and love, and the beauty and simplicity of life.  For those who are purists and love films, this one should be added to your library.  It is very simple, and delightful.",1156118400,9,509,4.75
