8214522,1,B000URDE9C,I was really getting into it and then there was a large segment missing. I thought I had a lemon copy but after reading the other reviews I see that all were the same. The gulpe bajo was to those that spent money on this and didn't receive the full novela...Pist off...don't waste your money..,1259798400,2,293,4.345454545454546
8214523,1,B000URDE9C,"I fully agree with the other reviewers.  I just do not feel that I can even give it 2 stars.  And this has nothing to do with the performance of the actors.  They were superb.

The telenovela only shows the beginning of the movie and then the end.  A whole chunk in the middle is missing.  And there is not even a lead in part before the end which tells you what went on.

Charge a bit more for the DVD, but do not shortchange the customer.  Bah!",1223164800,,446,3.9886363636363638
8214524,2,B000URDE9C,This abridged version was just not right the first 3 sides deal with only the beginning and the last side with only the finale. no middle or anything in between. I own other novelas on dvd and i hadnt been ripped off yet until i got this. if you are contemplating on buying this product i suggest you save your money for something better.,1207353600,3,338,4.296875
8214525,2,B000URDE9C,"The film is good in itself the actors are good but the film has been once again too much cut denaturating it...suddenly, the woman who laid for two years in the coma is dead and we hear that the husband who waited so long for her to wake up, has divorced her (so she must has woken up, been a vilain etc and been killed, the husband who was such a weak man is suddenly transformed in a killer who killed everybody...why? how? when?...whatever...it is really not worth your time and money... Do not buy it if you want to spend a good time...once again it is the same company who cut the film as the one which made El Candidato y un nuevo amor...with very little regard for the novela and very little regard for the consumers...maybe just interested in quick money...",1206230400,,765,4.356643356643357
8214526,2,B000URDE9C,"This telenovela was Lucia's last starring role in a Mexican telenovela. From the year 2000 when Lucia was 49, it tells the story of Silvana who is a housewife to a male fashion designor. One night, knowing he is about to be promoted, he purposely positions his own wife at a party to be raped by his boss who has been lusting after her. Appalled at the discovery, she leaves him only to fall in the hands of a new lover....who just happens to be the rapists' son!

Trashy at best, it was a great telenovela...until you get to the last side of the disc. This company gave us the complete telenovela from the beginning and then the very end of it, completely cutting off the middle! How unproffesional on their behalf to bookend a story! It was so choppy and unfortunate that they couldn't take the time out to hire editors to compile the hightlits and present somewhat of a complete story to tell like the Televisa ones that have been released...OR release them in volumes like the ones Laguna Productions have been releasing (Azul Tequila, Las Juanas, Como En El Cine).

Otherwise from the lack of proffesionalism, the telenovela was entertaining and even watching the end, one can fill in their own blanks as to how the story might have been even though the viewer shouldn't have to. The producers should have known better.

So if you don't mind missing the middle, I say go for it and buy this DVD. It's certainly entertaining and the gorgeus Lucia Mendez looked human still at this point.",1204502400,5,1491,4.5767790262172285
