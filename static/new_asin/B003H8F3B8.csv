8396840,1,B003H8F3B8,"I don't write reviews very often but with this movie, I feel like I need to warn parents. Most of the time, when I watch movies, they are for my kids. I don't pay a lot of attention, just enough to make sure that things are normal and that my kids are watching something that maybe has a good point that they can walk away with and think on for a while. With Spirit of the Forest, I started getting a bad vibe pretty early on. Every time I spent a little time looking at it, it disgusted me, up to the point to where I started paying more attention. In short, this movie isn't going to be something that your kids should watch. I don't know what kind of people would be involved in making a movie like this. Definitely not the kind that I want to hang out with, and I'm pretty liberal. I enjoy listening to rock music and surfing, among other things. I tried to give this movie a chance for about thirty minutes, but one disgusting thing after a dark other led me to shut it down for the sake of my children. Please don't help dark people like this make a living.",1315526400,4,1063,4.115384615384615

8396842,1,B003H8F3B8,"I wouldn't go as far as the previous reviewer in saying that it's some kind of liberal conspiracy movie (and if it is, I'd hate to hear what people say about movies like Ferngully and Once Upon A Forest). I doubt that the fact most Humans care little for our impact on the environment is a newsflash to anyone, nor is the fact that some of us kill other living creatures for a mirad of reasons ranging from amusement to actual neccessity. That being said, however, I can't give this movie a better rating. The CG animation is of a *far* lower quality than the cover makes it appear (more in line with a Saturday morning cartoon than an actual feature-length movie). I don't think I found a single joke in the whole movie funny, and more than a few scenes were so gross I preferred to look away rather than watch them. The imagery is often dark and desturbing (the woman trying to decapitate a cat with a chainsaw comes to mind), and the peaceful outdoor scenes look very fakey. The animation has several parts that are noticibly poor when compared to a good (or even decent) CG movie. Also, the Humans are distorted almost beyond recognition. In short, there are a lot of good CG titles out there, but this certainly isn't one of them.",1286150400,8,1235,4.4449339207048455
