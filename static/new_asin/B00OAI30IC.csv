8682956,5,B00OAI30IC,"Another brilliant proof of the versatility of RV if executed by professionals. None of their findings is ""new"" to a person who followed the 9-11 truth train on other tracks - its just an interesting study in the validity of RV.

It also seems quite courageous for a guy like Courtney to publish this - knowing the CIA and others who are certainly part and parcel of the perpetrators of 911 watch him closely. Just now 3 journalists of renowned TV channels died a sudden and untimely death who planned to produce a more popular version of the 911 truth findings. So if Courtney all of a sudden developes an agressive cancer or his plane takes a dive we won't have to look far for the cause.",1424995200,2,689,4.425196850393701
8682957,3,B00OAI30IC,"Curiosity about ""Remote Viewing"" led to this purchase. I wasn't impressed with the demonstrations presented in this ""highly acclaimed"" DVD. If this is the best that can be expected, remote viewing leaves much to be desired.",1424390400,,223,5.222222222222222
8682958,4,B00OAI30IC,"If you're only planning on buying one of the two DVDs in the series, or if you're deliberating whether to buy both at once and are short on money, I'd recommend getting this one and calling it done, or at least until you view it. The RV'ing of the Twin Towers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-1/dp/B00OAI24T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Part 1""</a>&nbsp;is so repetitive and frequent, some of it is actually included in Part 2. I'm not sure if this is bleed-over from bad or redundant targeting, or what. Since the editors purposely left out the actual target Text when you're watching the viewing, you really don't know. And you really only need to see a viewing of the tower part once, IMO to get enough of the point. If you want to see all the details, of course, get Part 1 as well.

In my opinion, the Twin Towers portion of that day's attacks have been much more studied by the public. For anyone who's delved into information contradicting the official coverup-report, the results are only surprising in their provenance, not their content. What I wanted to know were details behind the less-studied Pentagon situation, where there are fewer data, hypotheses, and attention; but which is also somewhat ironically a much, much easier case to demonstrate to a neophyte that the given story is bull poop. I mean, if you find video and pics of the Pentagon before the roof collapsed, or even after (you can see one on Farsight's page for this product; although fittingly, that actual view is not included in the video, though a similar one does form Courtney's greenscreen backdrop), it's clear that an aircraft of the width they claimed didn't go in there. With that behind you, you can then ask: ""What did?"", but of course that assumes something did ""fly into"" that building. And for the purposes of Remote Viewing, even that should not have been assumed, even though the final results ultimately did indicate that. (It could've been a stationary bomb, for instance; at least you want to leave open that possibility. More on that below.)

Apparently, a self-propelled device got launched from the waterway in the Potomac, Tidal Basin, or other nearby waterway... therefore near the Jefferson Memorial, which is on the other side of the river. This is not a spoiler, but clarification, because the info the Viewers got is so good, it lacked proper analysis (or maybe was deliberately left out), perhaps because the people involved were unfamiliar with the geography of the Pentagon area--and if so, didn't bother to actually look. No maps were provided. Nothing was discussed about the surrounding geography. Do yourself a favor and before watching it, look up a map of the Pentagon as it relates to the bodies of water near it. The Pentagon is a short walk's distance from not one, but several bodies of water. Lacking this, I bet most viewers missed this critical context--which makes the video so much more powerful and validated.

My main problem: the targets are NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED in either video! Courtney actually tells you in the video, to go to Farsight's website and look up the targets yourself if you want to know what they are, and read them yourself! Yes, I'm serious! What little reasoning provided on this is fairly paltry. Something about the time it would take to do so. But the targets are only 2 sentences long! If I pay all this money for 2 DVDs, why should I have to pause, go to a website, and keep flipping back and forth, to get the full picture of what this DVD is about? Also, in DVDs, it's easy to include a simple text file, HTML file, or PDF that could have the actual text of the targets hardcoded onto the product you bought, which could be viewed with a computer, which many people watch DVDs on anyway. So if not for convenience' sake, for archiving: if their site ever went away, you'd still have that record. And by the way, these DVDs are burned, not pressed.

My recollection is that it's not always even clear when the video is switching targets. You can usually see the target coordinate at the top of the whiteboard, but you have to pay attention. It's not like Courtney pops up between each one, announcing a new target, and then reading the actual TARGET TEXT like I expected. I think the reason is the resultant viewing may not always match up precisely with the actual target. The actual RV results are however definitely topical to the overarching subject, and what we and the taskers really wanted to know--which I caught note of, and have thought a lot about. I've always wondered if the Matrix would give you the answer you really were searching for, if you formulated the actual wording poorly.. kind of like a ""Google autocorrect"". I think we have the actual answer now. I found the same weaknesses in the Mars Face targets: the targets were based on assumptions, which should not necessarily have been assumed (Courtney, contact me and I could tell you). Even the target coordinates themselves are poorly chosen, in my opinion. They're so short and non-unique, I'm SURE those characters appear in many places in Earth's datasphere. Yes, that doesn't ruin the mission, but why increase risk of failure when you don't have to? Even the sub-targets are the same target name, with just a -10, -20, -30 tacked on the end. Targets are supposed to be blind. But coming up with a short code, and then throwing consecutive hyphenated numbers onto the end of that code, obviously implies that all these targets are related. Of course, yes, the viewers could assume as much anyway; though in theory, they couldn't and shouldn't rely on that. Again, not a catastrophic error, but all of these little things, and others I'm not mentioning, when added up, could produce a real difference in quality. I know for a fact if I were an RV'er, I'd want totally unique codes for every target I looked at. If for no other reason than, if the target name were similar to the previous target, it would invoke my memory of the previous target, and I'd wonder if were getting new stuff, or my memory of the previous stuff. And, with the repetition especially in Video 1, that could be part of what's happening. Although, I did also think the target texts were too redundant or overlapping, too.

I'll hammer on the targeting more, specific to Video 2 (sorry Courtney; I love ya). There is a target which is supposed to isolate the actual AA aircraft that the officials claimed to hit the Pentagon, AFTER the attack. (It's target 10f, if you'd like to know, though you could not know that from the video.) There are multiple problems with that target. First, it assumes there was a plane flown as AA Flight 77 on that day (a premise Courtney now admits may have been false). Also, any plane can be substituted in for a scheduled, established flight. Another: the target says ""Eastern time"", but does not specify Daylight Time or Standard Time. This affects results by an hour! That's huge. I could go on. I feel vindicated but sad to say that the show barely even mentions this target--almost as if 10f wasn't part of the mission. Literally no footage of that viewing, AFAIK (again, targets are not really clearly associated with footage), is included. They also don't admit in the video, that they really got nothing on that target (because it was poorly formulated--and I think the results, or lack thereof, are ample evidence, especially in light of the otherwise-spectacular results). You actually have to listen to multiple interviews Courtney gave to publicize this project, to find that explanation, as to where the results for that target are, and why it wasn't included. It's still significant. Not providing full disclosure or full representation of results, in the actual final product, also erodes credibility. I personally would like to see both RV'ers hemming and hawing and saying they're not getting anything, if that's what happened, as I heard Courtney say in the middle of  promotional interview. I feel input such as what I gave would've increased the odds of having a fruitful target. With some more research, that target could've been some of the most important information. As it is, I think the ""Matrix Autocorrect"" system did kick in and provide what we basically needed to know, from other targets. I just don't think, as a trained remote viewing tasker, you should force the matrix to decide between your actual wording, and the intent of your wording.

Another odd/annoying point. Although Courtney said there was so much material, they had to split it into 2 shows, there is repeated time-wasting, such as showing the full video of viewers slowly wiping off their large whiteboards... fully... slowly... usually twice... to have a fresh slate. Really. Why not edit this out? You don't include the actual text of the Targets, ostensibly for sake of time, but we watch them do cleanup duty? Who can put together a professional DVD but can't edit out board-wiping, when the subject isn't even talking? I eventually just started fast-forwarding every time they started wiping, knowing it'd be a minute or more before they were done. In the end, it's a small price to pay for learning what's inside. I'll say it's reflective of the quirky, occasional counter-productivity I perceive in Courtney's otherwise-brilliant personality. I know this man well-enough that in interviews I can now predict how he's going to answer a question. It's probably pompous, but I'd offer to let him run targets by me as part of a reality check. In all honesty I think it's needed.

Farsight Institute is apparently (at least partially) compromised. Courtney has stated (without using the actual word ""compromised"") that this was more-or-less intentional on his part. He's said he deliberately has ""ex-CIA"" and ex-military on his board of directors (to my knowledge, there is really no ""ex"" CIA agent, hence the quotation marks; it's like the mafia--or is). He has said as much as he believes his organization will be, and actually has been, less messed-with, with them on their board (even if Emeritus). Okay. And before you object by saying, ""Then why did they allow this project?"", he's said that most of their insiders are for the truth on THIS one getting out (just not on all other things, apparently). And prior to that, he's quoted himself as saying, 'the intelligence community would never LET us'. During the course of the Remote Viewing, at least one of the RV'ers ran into an apparent Remote Viewing blockage or shielding at at least one target (again good stuff in Part 2). I feel shortchanged that Courtney says nothing about this in the video, yet comments about it in a free interview online--where he also contradicts himself by saying that he personally checked for shielding before the project started, found it, and ""cleared it easily"", even saying it was ""child's play"" to do so. Not so, apparently, when you watch the video. This remains unreconciled in my mind.

The main point of Farsight is research into mysteries--and mainly esoteric mysteries. Sure, a lesser part is education about RV, but if you look at their site and listen to interviews and view the videos, it's clear the main focus is on the mysterious/unexplained. Yet, the military/CIA board members have insisted (ahem, ""requested"") that he not do any RV topics which involve extra-terrestrial life! The question: ""Does life exist off-planet, especially intelligent life?"" is in the top 2 or 3 of the most important questions and mysteries of all time. And the top one for most: ""What happens to our consciousness when we die?"", has already been remote-viewed repeatedly by others, with results public and freely available. Which leaves the ""alien question"" as the front-and-center, elephant-in-the-room mystery waiting to be cracked open with a good public project, perfect for an organization like this. Hm, what a wonder that their CIA/mil people find a reason and way to suppress, I mean ""request"" against... this one. (Like Gulf War II, I'm sure any reason given to Courtney doesn't match up with the real one.) Evidently, it's a much bigger secret than who was behind 9/11. And where are the ""good guy"" insiders on this? It's funny: despite the insistence of these board members, aliens keep popping into their organization's results anyway! E.g. the Giza Pyramids and the Face On Mars--er, I mean that Martian spew right next to it, of course. [Insert Simpsons' Nelson ""HA ha!"" here.] Time's a-wasting. Cut yourself free or just contradict the directive. See what happens.",1422576000,10,12555,4.887846081651807
