7622368,5,B01B6V2FMC,"Mr Selfridge was the rival in 2013 to The Paradise which began a year earlier. IN 2013 they went head-to-head and Mr Selfridge won, and now continues for its 4th season. Every season of both series is excellent and worth the purchase. Own, don't rent, as this is worth multiple viewings, that good. They deal with the same real story of the man who made the big department store an item of history.
Harry Selfridge continues to be played by Jeremy PIven, flawlessly. He has department store office help in Crabb (Ron Cook) and Grove (Tom Goodman-Hill). Others who have been with this show from the start and continue are Miss Mardle (Amanda Abbington), Frank (Samuel West) Victor (Trystan Gravelle), George (Calum Callaghan), Kitty (Amy Beth Hayes), well the list continues.

New 2016 episodes, aired beginning in January, with the storys beginning in 1928. Lady Mae (Katherine Kelley- all 10 episodes after being gone for 2015) returns to London, and of course Harry gets himself into financial difficulty again with hasty promotional decisions. Grove celebrates his 20 years with Selfridges.
Family dynamics and relationship are played up in episode two and a highlight, or low-light, of the third is an affair of a significant person.
As can be expected, in the typical Selfridge fashion, the store has its ups and downs with more sub-plots and relationship issues than the store has departments. Outsiders get involved, as does Harry, not his first unwise fling. Its more and more of the same old fantastic storylines and believable acting. So many returning characters it is like a family reunion.
TEN new episodes; but fans will crave more, just what Harry Selfridge depends upon.
I bought and saved and have watched and re-watched every season. Go ahead and pick up The Paradise on DVD and youll see a parallel story, and learn just how GREAT Mr Selfridge had to be to beat out the competition in 2013.
Mr Selfridge is a Masterpiece modern classic, worth more than five stars at our house.",1460073600,6,1996,4.905325443786983

7622374,4,B01B6V2FMC,"Mr. Selfridge Season 4:  If you're watching Season 4, you've seen the first three seasons.  Going into Season 4, we knew it was going to cover the ""downfall"" of Mr. Selfridge.  I was not sure that I'd like that ""story line"" as much as Mr. Selfridge's ""rise"" during the first three seasons.  However, I've thoroughly enjoyed the series, so I had to give it a watch.  There's no doubt that there are some episodes that will give you a melancholy feeling.  However, it's still a solid four stars.  There are still some very good story lines with some of the other characters.  Season 4 is entertaining and you will enjoy the journey.  Will you like the ending???  Watch it and decide ...",1468627200,2,684,4.532786885245901

7622376,5,B01B6V2FMC,"All services were as expected. The last of the Mr. Selfridge saga was not nearly as good as the first three series. Oh well, that's all folks!!",1468368000,,143,4.333333333333333

8749434,5,B01B6V2FMC,I was kind of concerned about how this series would end having read the real life story of Mr. Selfridge.  I can tell you I was not disappointed with the final season of MR. SELFRIDGE.  It could not have been done better.  I loved this series and was very happy with the final season.,1525219200,,284,4.222222222222222

8749439,5,B01B6V2FMC,Nice ending to a great PBS series.  Very talented group of actors and writing well done. Seasons 1 and 2 were best but you need to watch all 4 for the whole story with it's ups and downs.,1483747200,,187,3.9210526315789473

8749441,2,B01B6V2FMC,"I am very disappointed with this item. Episode 7 is missing, Episode 6 is on the disc twice. Unfortunately I did not discover this until Oct 25th and the item is no longer returnable after Oct 23rd. The return window should be longer than 30 days. Especially at this time of year because people are buying Christmas gifts already. I would have been very embarrassed if this had been a gift! Now I am just stuck with trying to find another way to view Episode 7 and I am stuck with an incomplete season. My advice is to not order any videos unless you can watch them right away.",1477440000,,577,4.302752293577981
8749442,5,B01B6V2FMC,"Great story, sad in so many ways Mr. Selfridge had so many destructive bad habits...  and yet was such a success in treatment of staff and working women.

Then, another thing I do not understand is why SOMEWHERE in description this movie will ONLY play on a ""Region A"" type of DVD player!  I never knew such a thing existed, but this entire series will not play on my Sony BDPS6500!",1477180800,,382,4.352112676056338
