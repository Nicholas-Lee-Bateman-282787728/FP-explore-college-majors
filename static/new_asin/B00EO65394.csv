5929658,5,B00EO65394,I have been using the Kristin McGee MTV Pilates for a long time and once I got pregnant I knew she was the best bet for quality pilates and yoga for this time in my life.,1430870400,,170,3.75
5929659,4,B00EO65394,"I was in search of a Pilates/Yoga program that would be safe to perform during my pregnancy.  I read about this program in one of my fitness magazines, so I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  I enjoy the the Pilates strengthening program - it isn't super intense, but it's enough to make you feel like you're actually doing something.  The yoga programs are good too.  If you have never done yoga before, I probably wouldn't recommend starting now (or starting with this particular DVD).  Some of her moves are a little more advanced (that's she altered to work with your pregnant belly).  Doing the yoga has really helped alleviate any pain I've had in my hips or joints during this pregnancy.  You aren't going to burn a lot of calories with this program, but you will feel relaxed.  And your muscles won't feel as tight or stiff.  I would definitely recommend this DVD set to other mommies-to-be.",1398816000,2,908,4.549382716049383
8607314,5,B00EO65394,"I love, love, love this video and I love Kristin McGee. I was so happy to finally find a yoga video that challenges me and is not boring. I am still doing this video in my third trimester, although, I now need more modifications. Thank you Kristin!",1506124800,,248,4.297872340425532
8607315,3,B00EO65394,"This is a very fast pace workout and not for beginners.  This would be great for those that already know the standard yoga poses prior. Considering the speed of the workout, I would personally suggest only for first trimester.",1483228800,,226,4.794871794871795
8607316,2,B00EO65394,Good if you were already doing lots of yoga before pregnancy.  Wish she had mentioned more modifications.  Rented and would not purchase.,1478736000,,137,5.181818181818182
8607317,5,B00EO65394,"Do this workout several times a week and love it! I'm now 35 weeks so I have to modify a bit more, but I still feel awesome afterward. Definitely recommend",1476403200,,155,4.2
8607318,5,B00EO65394,I love all of Kristin McGee's work out videos!,1465257600,,46,4.222222222222222
8607319,1,B00EO65394,Way too fast paced for this pregnant body! And has to many plank poses and twists - needs more variety,1464134400,,102,4.15
8607320,2,B00EO65394,Really fast yoga circuit. Not quite sure this a yoga style of the norm. She goes over the moves really fast spending less than 3 seconds on each hold. Plus a lot of downward dog moves and not a lot of variety.,1459209600,,209,4.0
8607321,3,B00EO65394,"I am a beginner who has taken some gym classes in both yoga and pilates. This instructor is kind, thoughtful and supportive but moves at a very fast pace and was far faster than even my more intense gym classes. She jumps into the workout quickely and does not offer a lot of modifications and further advice in each pose. I would recommend this for a intermediate who wants to push themselves or advanced fitness level who is in late second or third trimesers.

Pros:
- instructor has a lovely tone and is encouraging
- lots of workout variance on the video
- fast paced workout will make you sweat and challenge you

Cons:
- instant digital format does not allow you to skip around
- intro and warmup seems not adequate
- not for beginners or those with harder pregnancies",1444003200,,774,4.4822695035460995
8607322,5,B00EO65394,"Easy to follow, not too stressful, but a really good workout.",1440720000,,61,4.636363636363637
8607323,5,B00EO65394,I am a long time fan of Kristin McGee Yoga and Pilates. I was so excited to find that she had a prenatal yoga DVD. I love that it provides the position depth I was looking for with the modifications needed. An excellent solution for those with more experience in yoga who need a go-to while they're pregnant,1436918400,,307,4.310344827586207
