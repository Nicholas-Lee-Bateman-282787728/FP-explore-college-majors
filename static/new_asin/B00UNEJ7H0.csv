8707584,5,B00UNEJ7H0,"BAD MEN OF TOMBSTONE is a neat little Western, in black and white, that came out in 1948. It represented, along with several oaters starring Rod Cameron (PANHANDLE, SHORT GRASS, STAMPEDE), the effort of Monogram Pictures, through its new, better-funded brand, Allied Artists, to upgrade its product. Although only 75 minutes in length, it features two very fine leads: a young Barry Sullivan and Broderick Crawford, and a solid supporting cast, including the veteran Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams. The plot is simple, but the action is swift, non-stop, and should satisfy the fiercest fan of older Westerns. Allied Artists offers quality production values, even a couple of musical numbers. BAD MEN OF TOMBSTONE partakes in an older rambunctious, romantic style that characterized Westerns from the 1930s, but at the same time, looks ahead, in its final denouement, to the more adult Westerns of the later 1950s. It is enjoyable, and certainly worthwhile for any old cowpoke who loves the genre, or, any younger viewer interested in discovering classic American cinema. Recommended (and thanks, again, Warner Archive).",1428624000,7,1113,5.329545454545454
