8354886,4,B0027LZ0KK,I loved this movie.the plot was as heart-wrenching as the comedy was hilarious!!!!!!!! I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Japanese movies...,1390176000,,148,5.478260869565218
8354887,5,B0027LZ0KK,"I got up early and dressed to go shopping.  Raining. Hard. No shopping. I had been looking forward to this for two days.  This was chin on the chest depressing.  My one-day-out-every month--shopping and lunch at China Gardens (when I lived in the big city it was Houston). Breakfast might help--polanta and cheddar with bison breakfast sausage, microgreens and cold hot tea (cold black tea with lemon and dash cayenne. drink it hot hot in winter)my winter spirit lifting breakfast.  Yes, I'm aware it's summer but corn flakes and almond milk wasn't going to do it. I turned on Netflix while waiting for my breakfast to cook. ""Shaolin Grandma"" Ok, granny kicking butt could make me feel better.  I laughted all thru the movie and immediately went on Amazon to order my own copy.",1377216000,,777,4.768656716417911
8354888,2,B0027LZ0KK,"'Shaolin Grandma' in English, this wasn't as goofy/funny as I'd hoped, but still a nice little film chronicling the life of an older lady who was the master of her own kung fu academy - who, one day, is literally booted out (after losing her first fight) by a much younger female rival and one of her goons. Escaping to the streets with her two most loyal students, Granny for the first time has to learn to fend for herself - finding love and loss on the way. Worth a look.",1356998400,,474,4.21978021978022
8354889,5,B0027LZ0KK,"I just finished watching this movie, and it was effin' awesome!  If you like silly kung fu movies, you should watch this.  If you like old ladies in silly kung fu movies, you should definitely watch this!  It's great, seriously I am so happy I stumbled upon this movie.

This movie is in Japanese with English subtitles.",1326585600,,320,4.56140350877193
8354890,5,B0027LZ0KK,"This was a spoof of spoofs film, and I thought it was extremely funny.

Predictable, crude, and dumb; yes, but funny.

Granny doesn't have one single line, and is really not the least bit a Shaolin Master, but her ""dance"" scenes are hilarious. The film is full of sight gags.

I gave it Five Stars because i never saw anything like it before.",1316217600,,342,4.396825396825397
8354891,5,B0027LZ0KK,"This film is a surreal experience; brilliantly awkward and hilarious on so many levels. Not everyone will enjoy it, but for that certain audience, this is absolutely pure gold. It sort of has a ""Big Man Japan"" kind of strangeness, only somehow manages to be even more bizarre. Watch it with a group and enjoy.",1264896000,,309,4.636363636363637
8354892,2,B0027LZ0KK,"Your website said that this DVD was in english and it was not!
I do not like watching movies that are not in english!",1252281600,,117,3.9166666666666665
