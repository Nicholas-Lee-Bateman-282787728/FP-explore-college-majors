5255352,4,B0093DCXUK,"I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE buying it and expecting the digital copy. I don't understand why the description isn't more clear that the code will not work for those of us in the USA. Classic example of ""read the fine print"" before buying. Of course, the movie is great.  That's why I bought it in the first place.",1500336000,,321,4.262295081967213
5255353,1,B0093DCXUK,"U.S. Customers CANNOT Redeem the Digital Copy! Canadians ONLY!

Even though this is a Region 1/A blu-ray, the digital copy is not available to customers in the U.S. It is only available through the Canada iTunes store. U.S. iTunes error message: ""This code is only valid for customers of the Canada store."" The URL found on the redemption instruction sheet included with the blu-ray sends you to a website: eOne Digital Copy Downloads. This website says it can only be used by Canadians.",1498694400,11,487,4.867469879518072

5255357,5,B0093DCXUK,Best movie,1493942400,,10,4.5
5255358,4,B0093DCXUK,The movie is great which is the reason I bought it since it stopped playing on Netflix. Like it so much I got the blue ray so I could have a digital copy for traveling. No where in the discription did it say I would not be able to get the digital copy because the DVD is from Canada and I need a Canadian iTunes account. Pretty shady if you ask me.,1492128000,2,348,3.8472222222222223

8535155,5,B0093DCXUK,"Love J. Law. Her and Bradley Cooper are great together. Throw in my Eagles, and family members that act very similar to mine and you got me hooked. Not your typical rom com. Instead a very well acted movie that everyone will like.",1519689600,,230,4.372093023255814
8535156,5,B0093DCXUK,One of my all time favorites. As someone who has lived just outside Philly all his life and a life long Eagles fan this film always makes me smile. They got the Philly atty tood and our hatred for Dallas just right. Superb acting.,1516838400,,230,4.25
