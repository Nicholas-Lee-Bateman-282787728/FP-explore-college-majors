8589977,5,B00D6I7HCM,"This is so much better than any film Ive seen in the last year or two, its almost dizzyingly good. Its utterly original, thoroughly engrossing, and immensely pleasurable. Its a small-scale film, sure, but thats what allows it to be anything but formulaic. Theres no point in giving away the plot - the story is just one of many riches here. It reminds me of Spike Lees debut, Shes Gotta Have It. But for my money this is the better film, and I found it more enjoyable. The performances are great, the dialogues fantastic. Everyone involved in this movie should be hugely proud of their work.",1412899200,,591,4.584905660377358
8589978,5,B00D6I7HCM,"Gimme The Loot is a film I found out about from a list regarding the 100 best films on Netflix right now. From the description I saw being mentioned parts in the film such as witty dialogue that included a character that talks about how condoms should be more like a yamaka where it just covers the tip. This alone grabbed my attention  because I love films where you can get lost in the dialogue. Two of my favorite directors, Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith are both masters of interesting dialogue.

 The film's main plot revolves around two graffiti writers who are determined to tag the apple that pops up whenever the New York Mets hit a home run. This was a concept that really captured my imagination. In my twenty two years of existence, I had never even considered or heard about people trying to tag the apple where the New York Mets play, and yet it sounds so simple and something I should've heard about years ago.

 This film blows me away because it's a film where literally nothing happens, and yet I still love this movie. At one point we have a fairly long scene with two guys attempting to pick the lock of a girl's apartment, and with it ending with the guy pick locking the door giving up and storming off like a little bitch. Pretty much nothing in this film gets accomplished, and yet I loved every minute of it. I guess this speaks for how great the dialogue is.

 Gimme The Loot feels like a documentary on everyday life in the New York City neighborhoods it takes place in. Without a doubt, one of the best street films since Do The Right Thing and even with Adam Leon's directing career only including one short and this film, I feel like he's currently better at being Spike Lee than Spike Lee is.",1411948800,,1727,4.411949685534591

The low-budget independent comedy/drama Gimme the Loot proves that when you have a talented director and cast to work with - even with limited resources - it can be done.

The movie features two streetwise kids, Malcolm and Sophia, who scrape by on grifting and scamming in a world full of grifters and scammers, with time out for the occasional drug sale or corner store heist just to keep life interesting. Their greatest kicks, however, lie in getting their spray paint cans out and emblazoning a wall with their artwork. Theyre clearly a product of the environment in which theyve been raised. Sophia, in particular, takes no guff from the equally streetwise people who try to do to her what she does to others. She knows the rules of the streets better than any of them, and shes not about to let anyone else get the upper hand over her. Malcolm seems to be a bit more of a novice when it comes to mastering the territory, but his innate charm, goofy, disarming smile, and lanky awkwardness are crucial elements in his getting what he wants from others. Malcolm and Sophia are platonic best friends from way back, but they banter and bicker and complete one another like an old married couple.

Gimme the Loots greatest triumph lies in making two characters, who should by all rights be fairly loathsome based on what they do, wholly likable and appealing to the audience. This is due in no smart measure to the extraordinarily engaging performances by Ty Hickson and Tatiana Washington whose relaxed naturalism gives the film that air of freshness and authenticity so crucial to making it work. Its the verisimilitude that draws us in and the believability that keeps us there.

The same goes for its neophyte writer/director, Adam Leon, who deftly captures the idiosyncrasies and rhythms of the New York City neighborhood in which it all takes place.

The movie also makes some subtle observations about race and class in Malcolms encounters with a white college girl who clearly wants to be a part of the hood culture, yet cant help but convey an air of superiority to both him and it.

Gimme the Loot doesnt have much of a plot in the conventional sense of that term. The movie merely chronicles a few days in the lives of these two very specific individuals. No big drama. No epiphanies or soul-shattering events. Just life as it is.",1386460800,2,2422,4.7004716981132075
8589980,3,B00D6I7HCM,"The characters are likeable and believeable and acting is good.  Worth renting if you're in the mood for a ""low man"" story.",1382227200,,123,4.590909090909091
8589981,2,B00D6I7HCM,I ordered this movie by clicking the wrong icon. I figured I had to watch it if it was paid for.,1380499200,,96,3.619047619047619
8589982,3,B00D6I7HCM,"Although the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival catalog calls this ""a charming crowd pleaser,"" this crowd member wasn't charmed. It is listed as a Crime/Drama, but it was more a comedy of errors! (This review was first posted on JayFlix.net May 14, 2012.)

A pair of two-bit chiselers fancy themselves graffiti artists (using stolen paint), but by morning other taggers spray paint over their artwork. BTW this is an Alpha-male method of ""marking territory."" If you doubt it, ask a gang member to paint OVER a tag left by the gang leader. It will never happen! This behavior is not limited to tomcats, dogs, wolves or coyotes, it's an instinctive human one, too. Does anyone remember ""Kilroy Was Here"" in WWII? (Ask your grandparents!)

In this lame little endeavor, our three principals are:
  * Ty Hickson (""Killer"") as an inept drug dealer, would-be lover, out-tagged tagger and general loser. I couldn't find anything about this guy to root for. He spends most of the film in his sock feet simply because a ""friend"" took his shoes.
  * Tashiana Washington (""Gun Hill Road"") as our ""hero's"" sidekick; she is just marginally smarter than he. For example, in the first half hour of the film she is robbed at least two times...three total for the day. Rough day!
  * Zo Lescaze (""Undoing"") as his customer; it was interesting to note that despite her chronic drug use, she went running regularly. I guess her health IS important to her!

Much of this movie feels ad libbed, with constant profanity-laced bickering between our two principals and some jerky hand-held camera work. Expect lots of drug use, no gunshots or blowie uppie stuff and only a bit of foreplay. (I needed subtitles to understand a lot of the squabbling.)

This won the 2012 SXSW Competition Award: Grand Jury for Best Narrative Feature, so the good folks in Austin saw something that went right over my head! Get the DVD from Amazon and you just might spot it too.)",1365379200,,1942,4.804804804804805
