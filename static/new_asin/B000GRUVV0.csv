8134199,5,B000GRUVV0,"I enjoyed this DVD it was very informative and the onscreen tablature was very helpful. Also the jams with Arlen Roth were exeptional, i am a Mick Taylor fan and enjoyed this DVD very much",1399334400,,188,4.4

8134201,4,B000GRUVV0,I liked Mick's work on Exile on Main Street and on the newly released bonus material.  This instructional video shows how he did it.  He could have used a bit more clarity in showing chords and licks (actually Hot Licks should have done this by providing a booklet that included all of the licks he performed on the DVD.  Not all of the licks are documented).  But if you have a good ear you can overcome this lack of clarity.  A good DVD to add tools to your playing.,1353024000,2,468,4.213483146067416
8134202,5,B000GRUVV0,"I  was given this DVD as a Christmas gift. It is  an honest, candid, and unpretentious look at Mick Taylor's approach to playing music.  Listening to Mick Taylor play, is akin to hearing a guitarist as unique as Peter Green, or Jeff Beck. His explanations are simple, and he's always down to earth . As always, his vibrato is gorgeous, and his slide playing is  resonant , and singing! Arlen Roth does a nice job of keeping the session basic, and always fun. I highly recommend this DVD. Any level player can gleen something from this. It's just a matter of how open -minded you choose to be...!!!",1230508800,7,597,4.5
8134203,3,B000GRUVV0,I had high hopes for this Hot Licks video (1 of 10).  Mick was with the Stones during my favorite period of their long career.  His playing on Mayall's 70 birthday concert dvd was the highlight.  Mick is one of those great players who can't explain what he's doing even when Arlen steps in to try and draw it out of him.  Mick really shines in the slide portions being equally adept with standard tuning as he is with open tuning.  I found the portions before the slide section lacking in freshness of ideas.  I would buy this again because Mick's performances are inspiring and a joy to see and hear closeup.,1171670400,7,609,4.392857142857143
