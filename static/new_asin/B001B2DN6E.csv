8281507,5,B001B2DN6E,"I'm always a little concerned when I purchase the second volume of a DVD series because a lot of businesses like to coast off the first one. This isn't at all the case with ""Wrist Locks for the Street (Volume 2)"". In this DVD, Sammy Franco moves on to low wrist locks. I especially liked the wrist lock against a pick pocket. Before this DVD, I wasn't sure what to do in that situation. That's not the case anymore.",1415232000,2,415,4.265822784810126

8281509,4,B001B2DN6E,"The techniques demonstrated are well introduced and explained - which is very helpful for a first-time practitioner such as myself. Sammy also takes time to explain different hand positions, practice techniques as well as ""punch awareness"", a very critical skill to have when attempting to apply these wrist lock techniques. I recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a great introduction to wrist locks while also being able to apply the techniques immediately.",1386374400,,461,5.328767123287672
8281510,2,B001B2DN6E,"I was excited to receive this video however when I finally received it, I was totally dissatisfied.  There were only 3 wrist lock techniques presented they spent more time doing the same drills over and over.  The video participants did not show how one could apply this in real world scenarios.",1369008000,2,295,4.764705882352941
