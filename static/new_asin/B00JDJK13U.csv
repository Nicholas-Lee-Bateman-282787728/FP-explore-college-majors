6355280,4,B00JDJK13U,"Pennsylvania is at the heart of the story of ""Ten North Frederick,"" a movie directed by Philippe Dunne, a filmmaker who mostly worked for Twentieth Century-Fox, where he signed the screenplays of classics such as ""Magnificent Obsession"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Suez"", ""How Green Was My Valley"", "" Forever Amber"" and ""The Robe"". In 1955 he began directing films and although he did not do great works among the 10 films he made, some are more than acceptable, like ""Wild in the Country"", one of Elvis Presley's best films; the much appreciated melodrama ""The Inspector"" with Stephen Boyd and Dolores Hart, or the funny spy comedy ""Blindfold"" with Rock Hudson and Claudia Cardinale. However, ""Ten North Frederick"" exceeded my expectations. Filmed in black and white Cinemascope, it is based on a novel by the controversial John O'Hara, described as an irascible Pennsylvania social climber, who could not have a college career at Yale as he wished, when his father unexpectedly died. These facts allowed him to be a keen observer of class differences, which are dramatically expressed in the plot of the film, set in the fictional town of Gibbsville, which O'Hara used several times as the location of his stories. The movie opens with the post-funeral meeting of a Gibbsville patriarch named Joe Chapin (Gary Cooper), in which begins a retrospective account of his life. At the age of 50, Chaplin's professional plans collapse. His aspirations in the upcoming elections are betrayed by his ""image maker"" and by the local politicians, but the drama inside his house, the mansion on 10 North Frederick street is even worse: his upstart wife Edith (Geraldine Fitzgerald) scorns him, she has thwarted their son Joby's (Ray Stricklin) desire of entering Juilliard School to study music, and she is partially responsible of the abortion of their eldest daughter Ann (Diane Varsi) and the breaking of her marriage to a trumpeter of Italian origin (Stuart Whitman). While watching the film, which does not evade dramatic special effects (a great storm lashes Gibbsville during the night of the rupture and the abortion) or Leigh Harline's  musical bursts in the most classic melodramatic style, I remembered all the relationships I have seen truncated by differences of class, the prejudices against many who have wanted to study art, the agreements between corrupt politicians who have been discovered but are still in power, or castrating mothers who emotionally destroy their families... But in the final half hour of the film, the story made a sudden turn: when Chapin travels to New York to take a break, he looks for his daughter Ann, who has separated from the family. Arriving at her address, he knocks on the door and who opens is his daughter's roommate, the beautiful Kate Drummond (Suzy Parker). And then a tender love affair surges, but fleetingly, just as a preamble to his final days. In this last movement, the story is honest and Chapin, in a very lucid reflection on old age, says goodbye to Kate: there is no turning back, the deterioration of the man is eminent, the retrospective narration concludes and we return to the present, to the score settling with Mama Chapin. ""Ten North Frederick"" is perhaps the best kept secret of Dunne's career. Maybe his best film. Discovering it was very enjoyable, as well as the reunion with Gary Cooper, one of the greatest actors that the United States has given to cinema, accompanied by a prominent cast.",1482796800,3,3461,4.998266897746967

8649955,3,B00JDJK13U,"A story of a man and his family and a screenwriter that feel a flawed wife is responsible for her husband's alcoholism . Young Ray Stricklyn (the actor who portrays Gary Cooper's son in this film) goes on one of those painful to watch , cringe inducing and misguided rant's toward the end of this motion picture that nearly scuttles everything that went before . A better film would would find Gary Cooper's ""gentleman"" comporting himself in a more gentlemanly fashion . That said , the film has merits sprinkled throughout it's running time and is a ""good"" depiction of a dysfunctional family circa 1940 through 1945 . Cooper's the draw with plenty of solid support but is a 57 year old actor who looks 60ish portraying a 50 year old at the film's outset .",1527379200,,757,4.573529411764706
