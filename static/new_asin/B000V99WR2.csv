8217314,5,B000V99WR2,My grandkids can't get enough of these DVDs. Good clean fun with no bad language etc. Not only entertaining but they also learn GOOD things from them. No worries about bad examples or bad language.,1403049600,,197,4.6571428571428575
8217315,4,B000V99WR2,"I got the idea that this was one long feature about all the alphabet letters, but it's not.  It's six small episodes on different letter-based topics.  Only one of them has the whole alphabet song.  Another one focused on vowels.  That being said, the episodes are entertaining in typical Little People fashion, and if your kids likes any of the other Little People videos, they will like this one, too.",1397001600,3,403,4.714285714285714
8217316,1,B000V99WR2,This is only a 25 minute DVD...for $25!  When I purchased this I read the reviews and they were all good so I assumed I would be getting a quality DVD...I wish I knew that it was so short!,1390953600,,188,3.8205128205128207

8217318,5,B000V99WR2,"A great video from Fisher Price.  My son absolutely loves this and watches it over and over.  Additionally, I must note he can be picky with his programming so when I find a video or show that he likes that is also fun and educational, I consider that a win win.
This is actually our second copy, the first one which we purchased in store got damaged due to rough housing, I mean my son insisted on taking it everywhere with him.  So we had to replace it and turned to Amazon after being unable to find it in store.  The video came to us in record time thanks to Amazon Prime and was in great condition.
Bottom line, after seeing how much my son responds to these videos, this is his second, we also purchased ""Discovering Things That Go"" also from Fisher Price,  we plan on ordering additional titles.",1376352000,2,802,4.32
8217319,5,B000V99WR2,"This is one ""Little People"" DVD I really recommend. The stories are both engaging and educational. My baby really loves watching these over and over. All the stories teach something or the other about the alphabet. We have also used this as a temporary babysitter!",1362873600,,264,4.888888888888889
