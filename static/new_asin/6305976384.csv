1105310,4,6305976384,"Slumber Party Massacre is really about the problems that teens in the 80s faced.  It is sort of a cross between The Breakfast Club and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  You can really feel for the girls in the cliquey basketball team.  They are struggling with their emotions over the new girl in town while dealing with their immature boyfriends.  How could anybody be expected to perform under such pressure?  Yet they do!
The villian in this movie is subtle yet effective.  He does not mince words (until the very end when he has a touching sililoquy that makes your heart weep) yet he is able to convey so much feeling and rage.  I think it is his indiscriminate use of a very large portable drill in the seemingly random killings that does it.  Oh, don't get me wrong, he is so versatile an actor, he is also able to use knives!  My two favorite scenes involving him where when he was counting bodies in the trunk and realized that one got away.  His grief was so palpable it almost made me cry.  The other is near the tragic conclusion when his drill, really his symbol of manhood, was cut in two.  You could tell that he was effectively dead at that point because he had no reason to live.  Shakespeare himself could not have created a more tragic scene.
I think this may have won one of the more obscure 1982 Oscar awards: The Best Use of Portable Power Tools.

1105313,4,6305976384,"Overlook the much gratuituos nudity in this film, and you will discover a decent slasher flick. It is a decidedly 80s style horror flick and full of camp, humour, and bizarre killings. The Driller Killer himself is completely bizarre, stating at one point ""It takes a lot of love to do this"" and widening his eyes in a maddened way. Valerie and her sister are completely hilarious in this film. It isn't overly gory, but is a fun movie to watch.",981763200,3,445,4.506172839506172
1105314,5,6305976384,"At a time when many horror films are without nudity its always refreshing to watch one filled with nuditorial aspects.  This 1980's slasher flick did of course come out at the time of the Halloween series, Friday The 13th series etc. but I don't bash it as a rip-off or anything, I look at it as fun horror entertainment. When the flick opens we get cool music, and cool shots that lead to a house with a girl who gets nude for a moment, telling us we're watching the right movie. The radio tell us a maniac has escaped from a looney-bin, and is now out killing every bimbo and boy in town with a three-foot long drill. Giving him the name : The Driller-Killer! Of course there's a large body-count including the poor 'ol pizza dude! And one of the babes actually eats pizza while going threw the hell, to calm herself. Plenty of dead bodies, gore and breasts to please horror buffs like myself.",981504000,60,895,4.391566265060241
1105315,4,6305976384,"Trishes parents are going away for the weekend, so she invites some of her friends over for a slumber party, just a girls party for old times sake. Trish wants to invite the new girl, Valery, to the party but Valery overhears Diane slagging her off and desides to babysit her sister Courtney instead. The guys also deside to drop by and scare the hell out of the girls. It also seems that psychopath Russ Thorn has escaped from the mental hospital and has targeted the party, armed with a drill.
Lets get this clear, I'm a huge Slumber Party Massacre fan, I really enjoyed it, it's not just a horror movie, there are also some jokes in there. It sort of pokes fun at the horror genre. The deaths are really cool with some stomach turning sound effects. There is some good chase scenes and suspencefull scenes in SPM. The movie was written by feminist Rita Mae Brown but you wouldn't notice it, there is alot of nudity in it. The one big difference is that the girls arn't actully bimbos, it's the guys who are dumb, ok so there are a FEW stupid scenes but not many. On to the acting, it's a big 50/50 job here, Robin Stille who plays the girl next door and new girl Valery is the stand out of the female cast and really gives it her all. The rest of the cast arn't bad, most of them are believeable. Slumber Party Massacre makes a great nights entertainment, it's really cool.",981158400,7,1376,4.337209302325581
1105316,4,6305976384,"Slumber Party Massacre is a silly movie, but it's supposed to be.  The plot, as it stands, revolves around the escape of a maniac from a local mental institution who begins terrorizing members of a high school female basketball team.  This one really tends to be a lot of fun, it's by no means a great horror movie, but it's all done in good humor with a female director and writer.  What's really surprising is the amount of female nudity in this film.  Although it's not terribly explicit, this IS an exploitation film-one needs to look no further than the gym shower scene to understand that.  Slumber Party Massacre also manages to pile on some great gore effects and some genuinely funny moments (the bit with the pizza boy is hilarious).  For the brisk run time of 77 minutes, this is a fully loaded exploitation fan's dream and a great 80's slasher.  It won't win any awards, but have some friends over, gather around and have a blast, you won't regret owning this one!",971740800,18,976,4.574712643678161
1105317,4,6305976384,"I've recently written a retrospective of the series in Femme Fatales Magazine 9:3 to speak of what a truly fun, well-thought out movie this is. IT foreshadows SCREAM by poking fun at its own genre, yet keeping the  scares and gore intact at the same time. It has a good dose of feminism  from writer Rita Mae Brown and director Amy Jones (MYSTIC PIZZA) and  introduces one of my favorite B movie actresses Brinke Stevens. While  clearly a product of its time, it still holds up well and delivers 90  minutes of fun and suspense.",963964800,4,528,4.515789473684211

It's a lame production of a sexual fantasy world in which bras are non-existent and boobs are plentiful; where women quote sports statistics while soaping each other's breasts in the shower. In other words: if you like porno films with stories, you'll enjoy this.
Everyone else will see this for what it is: a director who just wanted to see boobs in real life so he made this garbage and called it a ""slasher film"".",1508457600,,437,4.4625

1105560,5,6305976384,"I will start off by saying that this DVD was an amazing buy all 3 movies in 1 DVD loaded with lots of extras. The transfer of each movies is very clear and crisp. Slumber Party Massacre 1 and 2 have New Anamorphic Widescreen Transfers. I really wish the 3rd movie had a Wide screen transfer.
COMMENTARY: Each film now has a commentary with some of the people who worked on the film as well as acted. This was where my questions that I have had for years had been answered. Everything was so informative. They even told you about some of the extras that were in the film.
3 -PART DOCUMENTARY: Each film now has a Documentary that goes in to details about each film; how its filmed, budget, actors, effects, music scores and bands, Requirements, locations, nudity, they also talk about working with Roger Corman and how they got into the industry. You also learn how they were given the project and how long it took to shoot each one. This was a huge surprise on the DVD set.
PHOTOS AND POSTER STILL GALLERIES: Each movie has its own stills and galleries also you can see different poses and photos taken for the cover of SPM2 in this set which was neat. Through out some of the features on this DVD you will see a lot of shots and stills from behind the scenes which was pretty amazing if you are a fan of the series.
TRAILERS: All the trailers for each film is on here.
PERSONAL REVIEW: Me being a fan of the series this really was an awesome release .I had grew up as a kid watching the series so seeing some of the behind the scenes and finding out where some of the actors are now was really awesome one thing I was bummed about tho was Michele Michaels was always my favorite actress from the first film I would have loved to have her on this to hear her experience working on the film I felt that she had a natural talent for acting.

DVD PACKAGING & DVD: The DVD cover is of the first movie, on the back it features Slumber Party Massacre 2 with a few shots from the film's but weirdly a shot from Sorority House Massacre which I think deserves a release like this. The DVD box is clear so when you open it, it has a back cover art that shows some shots of Slumber party Massacre 3. There are 2 dvd inserts with a pamplet inside that unfolds that tells some more about the films. On the first disk it is Slumber Party Massacre 1 with the 3 part Documentary. The 2nd disk is slumber Party Massacre 2 And 3 when you chose the movie on the 2nd disk it will take you to an alternate menu for each movie.",1437177600,2,2505,4.1970954356846475

1105562,5,6305976384,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter who watched this movie on cable as a young teenager. When it arrived she was very happy and excited to receive it. After watching the movies for an entire weekend, I would hazard a guess and say that she absolutely loves it. She and her kids had a movie night (complete with popcorn and bottled water--no sodas allowed). She told me that it was just as much fun watching it now as it was when she watched it as a child. ""Thanks, Mom for giving me a chance to relive some of my fondest memories."" You can't get a much better rating than that. Thanks Amazon for helping me provide a little joy to my daughter (she has lupus so every little bit of joy helps her along her in her fight).

1105565,5,6305976384,"Blu Ray Review: The Shout Factory Blu Ray contains a ""Making Of"", audio commentary, and trailers. Picture quality and sound is good. But if you want the Driller Killer trilogy then get the Roger Corman DVD set. But I only care about the first one because the 2nd and 3rd sucked butt.

Movie Review: A WOMAN DIRECTED THIS ONE! Wow! She did a great job. Yes this is your typical everyday slasher movie but it's a really great one. The naked chicks ARE HOT! Their boobs and butts are well groomed and tight. And......uh.... stuff. The story is moronic, the acting is lousy, the kills are fantastic and it's actually well directed. I love this movie.

In each film attractive high school girls are partying unsupervised in luxurious residential surroundings; the boyfriends crash the party; then stuff happens and a mad man with a cordless spiral shiny drill appears to perform major body piercing. The film set taught me three lessons: 1) Electric drill technology has improved since the 1970s film ""Halloween 3""; 2) A sufficient amount of extreme mayhem becomes stupefying; and 3) The attractive high school girls do not work but they party in luxurious surroundings -- they must be wealthy.",1422316800,,742,4.896825396825397

There is lots of gore, plenty of T&A for those into that , in fact there is one scene where the camera pans up and down on a woman taking a shower..pointless yes, but still for voyeurs... One really big positive for the film is the lovely actress Brinke Stevens. The film despite poor acting, typical teen campy 80s atmosphere is that it does have some suspenseful moments
Id recommend this one over Student Bodies , Toolbox Murders and Splatter University.

Exciting and intense 1982 slasher film from Roger Corman productions and was directed by Amy Jones and written by a feminist as it was one of the first horror movies made by women.

When Trish (Michelle Michaels) decides to invite her high school girls basketball teammates over for a slumber party, she has no idea the night will be ruined by an escaped mental patient with a portable drill in the cult classic The Slumber Party Massacre.

The only sane survivor of the first incident, Courtney (Crystal Bernard), dreams of the driller killer returning in the first sequel, Slumber Party Massacre II. She cannot help shake the feeling that she and her friends will be viciously tormented by the killer. Her nightmare becomes reality when the killer returns, reincarnated as an evil rocker with a deadly guitar.

After a relaxing day at the beach, a group of teens decide to have a slumber party. Their boyfriends predictably show up to scare them, but there is something much scarier lurking in the shadows as the group starts getting attacked by an unknown killer in the second, and last, installment, Slumber Party Massacre 3.

This thriller takes me back to memory lane to when I was 9 going on 10 years old in the 4th grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president & we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on from the recession we had from 1981-1982.",1391644800,,1281,4.7309417040358746

Not only are there multiple bonus features (including some great commentaries); but for the first time all these films are presented in 16x9 widescreen with stellar transfers (given the source material). I would say the movies should be ranked as follows: Part 1 - 4 stars - Part 2 - 3 stars (it's kind of a dopey ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" rip) and Part 3 - 2 1/2; but for nostalgia reasons - I would grade them all an A for entertainment.

1105975,4,6305976384,"Given all of the gratuitous nudity and clichd storyline in evidence during Slumber Party Massacre, you would never know that the film was written and directed by a pair of feminists.  If there were ever a slasher film where a girl victim actually finishes the killer off once she has him down, you would think it would be this one.  You would be wrong.  You won't find any of the girls in this movie singing ""I am woman, hear me roar"" because they're too busy dropping their weapons and running away like almost every other female victim in every other slasher film ever made.

When her parents go away for a few days, Trish (Michelle Michaels) decides it's the perfect time to kick it old school with a good old-fashioned slumber party with the girls.  No one seems to know there's a killer in their midst - an escaped prisoner who murdered five people back in 1959.  After twenty-plus years of not killing, Russ Thorn (Michael Villella) eagerly starts killing people in broad daylight (although no one notices) long before the slumber party even begins.  Truth be told, it isn't much of a party - only four girls are there, and they barely get a chance to start drinking and smoking weed before the fun begins - although they do find time to titillate a couple of high school boys by changing clothes in front of an open window.  Then the killer shows up, at which point all the girls turn into stereotypical slasher victims.  Meanwhile, the hot new girl in town, Valerie (Robin Stille) - who lives next door but wasn't invited because some of the girls are jealous of her--and her annoying younger sister begin to wonder what is going on at the party.  Needless to say, they eventually find out.

There's nothing particularly special about this movie, but it's a prime example of the classic slasher films of the 1980s.  There's no mystery to the identity of the killer, nor does he possess any sort of superhuman traits.  It's just young women in nightshirts versus an insane but very human killer.  In a sense, it's formulaic - but in another sense, it is one of the films that helped define the slasher formula to begin with.  It does have a few goofy moments, though (ostensibly because it was initially written as a parody).  Seriously, why is Trish's weird neighbor out killing snails with a huge knife at night?  And why does no one wonder what happened to Linda (scream queen Brinke Stevens in one of her first credited roles) when she never shows up at the house?  My favorite goof, though, comes when Trish picks up the coffeepot she left on a hot burner without getting burned.

Some professional reviewers have actually tried to put this film in the feminist blender and analyze the results, yielding a lot of hullabaloo over the killer's ""big drill,"" but that's all a bunch of hooey, if you ask me.  Maybe if Martina Navratilova had jumped out of the shadows and bashed the killer's head in with her tennis racket, they might have some ground to stand on - but no, even Val, the paragon of beauty, talent, and guts that she is, cries when she gets her feelings hurt.  Let's all just enjoy this film for what it is - a classic, old-school 80s slasher film.",1342310400,,3171,4.567137809187279

That morning, she gets up, dresses and heads to school. Meanwhile, a mass murderer with a fondness for power drills, Russ Thorn (Michael Villella), has escaped from prison, killed a telephone repair woman (Jean Vargas) with a power drill and steals her van. Trish meets up with her friends Kim (Debra Deliso), Jackie (Andree Honore) and Diane (Gina Hunter) and the girls on her basketball team. The new girl, Valerie Bates (a sweet Robin Stille) is invited by Trish, but refuses after hearing Diane talking cruelly about her.

Russ Thorn watches the girls leave school from the van and a girl named Linda (Brinke Stevens) goes back inside the school to retrieve something, but is attacked by Thorn and murdered with a power drill. That evening, the party and the bloody decimation begins of the girls, as they smoke pot and talk about boys. Valerie lives next door conveniently and is babysitting her younger sister Courtney (a refreshingly innocent if slightly annoying Jennifer Meyers). Diane's boyfriend John (Jim Boyce) and two other guys from school Jeff (David Millbern) and Neil (Joe Johnson) who spy on the girls undressing. Thorn kills Mr. Contant, drilling through his neck, and meanwhile, Courtney is begging Valerie to go crash the party, but Valerie protests. All hell is about to break lose at this party.

Probably the best known of the popular ""girls have a sleepover and get murdered one-by-one"" subgenre of horror movies. ""Slumber Party Massacre"" is fun, a little bit cheesy, and quite outdated. The film moves at a snail's pace throughout the first half and when the killer is reveled, he isn't exactly frightening. This is a prime example of ripe 80's cheese. That being said, this film is a blast. Sure it a bit slow but the deaths are pretty damn interesting and it is nice to see a final girl who is actually willing to fight back. At a lean 75 minutes, this is the kind of meat and potatoes horror movie that Hollywood simply doesn't make anymore. ""Slumber Party Massacre"" has the breasts, the blood and the beauties. What else could you want from an 80's slasher flick?

Interesting Facts about SPM:
* The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures in November 1982. It was later released on VHS by Embassy Home Entertainment.

* Director Amy Holden Jones made a shot a promo film of the original script's prologue for a $1,000 dollars so she could get a directing job from Roger Corman. Corman was so impressed by the promo that he asked Jones to make a feature length movie from the script.

* Andree Honore is the only cast member featured on the original theatrical one sheet poster. The blonde woman lying on the floor is late actress Jillian Kesner.",1329436800,6,2952,4.76908023483366
1105978,4,6305976384,"Im glad i got this collection! All 3 movies are in it and it wasn't very expensive. It brought some good old memories back....The slumber party massacre is now considered a horror classic for many horror fans. As for me, personally, my favourite one is the 2nd one, i know some people will say it was a weak sequel with a comedic tone to it that didn't fit the 2 other movies but its ok, it was different and had lots of funny moments and that's good!

The first movie is about Russ Thorn, he's a psycho on the loose that just escaped from prison. Hiding in his van in front of a school, he's spying on some girls and is definitely ready to do some serious damage....... and guess what?....Lucky Russ will find out that the girls he's been spying on are about to host a slumber party!........So how lame would be a slumber party without Russ and his drill right ? The movie has some nice killing scenes, great cinematography and a memorable shower scene at the beginning as well......

The 2nd one is hilarious! It's pretty much the same concept; some girls (in a band this time) are about to host a slumber party into some kind of cottage, they are planning to drink, party and play songs... but a mysterious  man who they thought was only in one of the girl's head and nightmares (Courtney) might actually become a real threat to them. This guy is cool, he uses a weird guitar which is also a drill (Huh?) to kill his victims, he has no pity, no mercy and wants to kill all the girls one by one. What i like about him is that he's having fun the whole time, he's singing , dancing and acting like a cool rock star during the entire movie. The killing scenes are great, very bloody!!, cinematography is also very good and the music is so fun it will make you wanna sing and dance like our maniac/killer!! Very good rock and roll!!

The third film makes a return to form with a psycho killer. This time, you won't know right away who it is and might be surprised when you find out. Overall its great, good acting, cinematography is OK and our psycho killer is absolutely crazy but the fun is gone, the rock and roll is gone and the comedic tone that the previous one had is gone too. There is nothing funny here (unless you wanna laugh at how crazy that guy is...lol..)and the movie is as serious as the 1st one.

So 4 stars for the 1st one, 5 stars for the 2nd one and 3 stars for the last one would be my ratings. Overall this is a very good collection package. It also features the story behind those films and other acclaimed movies by Roger Corman. Very  decent for the price!

1105979,3,6305976384,"Ah yes. A great crap B movie. I mean that with the deepest respect too. Could I watch a terribly made movie over and over? The answer, YES! NO doubt this movie sucks, but the elements that make it suck are great. Terribly unnatural and clunky dialouge. At best pedestrian acting. Was I the only one that thought it was gross how in the shower scene when Trish has just washed her ass with the bar of soap the next girl asks for it and proceeds to wash all over? I also love how the handy woman can install a peephole just by drilling through the door. Presto! next scene it's there! That's the point though. This isn't a work of art meant to be analyzed like the classics. It's a guilty way to spend 77 minutes, and in that it succeeds wonderfully. The running time is great too. It ends before you're bored, or have fallen asleep. On a sidenote I was completely confused and laughing outloud at how the trailer for Sorority House Massacre 2 had shots from this movie spliced in! It's not even part of the series! Quality stuff. Buy this movie, pop some popcorn, have 3-15 beers, and enjoy.",1316649600,,1090,4.348039215686274
1105980,5,6305976384,"I) The five star rating is based upon the strength of the first film. The movie starts out with organ music, the type you would expect to see in a Vincent Price movie. The first nude scene comes quickly as Corman always shoots the all important scenes, such as young girls getting dressed first thing in the morning. What is most funny about the film was the choice of murder weapon, a battery powered drill. Anyone who has ever used one of these things on a human knows that it is okay for flesh, but as soon as you hit bone it stops or slows down and runs out the battery. Sometimes it spins back.

The movie contains several noteworthy scenes such as the ""peeper"" scene which carried over into the two sequels. This one also had the memorable shower scene (pass the soap please). For you youngsters, this was an era when 18 year old teens could legally buy alcohol. The Jim Jones and Kool-Aid reference was also of the era. Note the telephone color co-ordination of red and turquoise, all in the same model. BTW, the correct way to ease drop on an extension phone is to disconnect the receiver, unscrew the mouth piece and remove the diaphragm,  reconnect the receiver then listen.

II) Courtney survived the first one and has bad dreams going into the second one. She is in an all girl band who go away for the weekend. They have a pillow fight and are spied upon by boys. Only one girl goes topless for the lone nude scene. The killer in this one is a greaser from Courtney's dream. He has more character than the killer in the first film, but this movie makes less sense and doesn't have the ""fun"" aspect of the first one.

III) This movie is the final installment as it starts out with beach volleyball. This time when the girls get together they play striptease until the boys walk in on them. More nudity than the second one, but the killer was more boring.

The first film is worth owning as a cult classic. The other two leave something to be desired. Unless you can find the first film at a decent discount, you might as well get the 3 pack with the commentary.",1306195200,13,2073,4.374025974025974

1106097,4,6305976384,"Any sicko with a thing for slasher flicks has either seen or knows about the Slumber Party Massacre films. They probably also know that all three films were directed by women-an interesting idea in a predominately male oriented genre. The difference in style really comes through with a woman behind the camera. I'll tell ya what I love about these movies and what makes them different, but first a quick plot summary:
Slumber Party Massacre-The name pretty much says it all. Some high school girls get together for a slumber party and are menaced by an escaped lunatic wielding a power drill(symbolism?).
Slumber Party Massacre 2 is kind of like ""Josie and the Pussycats On Elm Street"". One of the survivors of the first massacre(Crystal Bernard) is tormented by nightmares of the massacre mixed with visions of future events, her insane sister, and a new driller killer wielding a guitar with a drill on the end. Her and her friends are part of an all girl rock band and decide to have.....a slumber party!! The weird hallucinations(or are they?) continue, and soon the killer himself pops in. He's a rocker with a leather jacket that looks a lot like Andrew Dice Clay or John Travolta from Grease.
Slumber Party Massacre 3 is not tied in with the storyline from 1 and 2 at all-it's just another story of a slumber party crashed by a guy with a drill. This time the killer is impotent too!

What's cool about the first film is that the girls are a bit more believable than they tend to be in these kinds of films. Usually the writers of slasher films try to cram as many cliched personalities and characters together as humanly possible-Basically, people who would never actually hang out together. Here the girls all seem like they would actually be friends, no token bitchy girl, slutty girl, nerdy girl, virginal girl, etc. Plus, if able, they all fight back when threatened as opposed to just sitting there screaming. They also band together to fight against the invader. The few male characters aren't just horny jerks either, but seem to have a good relationship with the girls. Then there's the killer himself. No attempt to keep him a secret, they let you know right off the bat who this guy is. He's no masked juggernaut, but a normal(if not slightly crazy) looking guy who makes mistakes and is sometimes downright clumsy. He's given quite a bit of screen time too. Usually the killer is only shown when chasing, stalking or attacking, but here they show him doing other things. One scene shows him stashing the bodies. Another interesting scene has him chased from a room by one of the females! I don't know if I've ever seen a slasher film where the killer turns and runs from one of his female victims, not off the top of my head anyway.
All in all, Slumber Party Massacre will never be considered a great movie(it is a slasher film after all), but it's definitely a high point in the genre.
Part 2 is very different in tone, but still holds that female camaraderie. In this film things have taken a supernatural tone. Obviously the attempt here was to cash in on the, then very popular, Nightmare On Elm Street films by making a Freddy Krueger-like dream killer. The killer speaks mainly in rock and roll lyrics, and at one point the film even stops for him to sing a musical number! Lots of fun and my personal favorite of the three films(thanks to repeated showings late at night on HBO when I was a kid).
Part 3 is the lesser of the three. A sequel in name only, it has a heavy duty straight to video feel(even though it did have a theatrical run). It's also the most by-the-numbers slasher of the rest. It's okay, but only just interesting enough to keep you watching.
With a name like Slumber Party Massacre you'd think these films would be wall to wall boobs, but the sex and nudity is pretty scarce.
The set has a few nice extras, but the highlight is the documentary discussing all three films. Oddly, Deborah Brock, director of Part 2, seems to be the only one who really seemed to have fun making her film, and is very excited to talk about it today. Amy Jones, director of the first film, is proud of the film and has good memories of Roger Corman, but she seems to treat the film as something that she once did in her crazy youth that she'll finally just have to accept will follow her around forever. Sally Mattison, director of Part 3, doesn't like horror films and seems to have just taken the film as a paycheck. She doesn't seem very enthused about the film at all, and it shows in the final product.
This is a very fun DVD set if you want to finally see these films given a much snazzier treatment. That and if you're a slasher movie fan that wants to check out something a little different.",1290988800,3,4725,4.532786885245901

They're now finding a whole new audience in the next generation thanks to their arrival on DVD after many years of wearing out VHS tapes. This is the best-looking set as far as picture/audio quality goes, but somebody loused up on the DVD structure by trying to save money.

They put the first movie and most of the special features on disc 1, and then parts II and III on the second disc with a few more, smaller features. After watching Part II or Part III, you have to put the first disc back in to view the features (ie. making-of featurettes, picture gallery for that movie). It's a never-ending shell game of watching and replacing DVDs. That's the only point where the Massacre Collection was a better set. Theirs had 3 discs instead of two. It wouldn't have been that expensive to make this a 3-disc collection with the features on each disc with their respective movies.

1106100,2,6305976384,"Based on a ridiculously-undeserved glowing review on another DVD review website, I went and bought ""The Slumber Party Massacre Collection"" from Shout Factory.

I realize this franchise has its cult fanbase, but for the life of me I cannot see why.

I only watched the original 1982 installment, and honestly, don't know if I'll bother with the two sequels based on what I've seen. I love schlock as much as the next person but there's a difference between GOOD cheese and just plain stinking rotten.

High school senior Trish and her galpals Diane, Kimberly and Jackie plan a party when Trish's parents leave for the weekend. Diane doesn't want them to invite new girl and next-door-neighbor Valerie, so she stays home with bratty kid sister Courtney. That is, until strange happenings have the sisters heading next-door only to discover the carnage. Courtney is so whiny and annoying, you will be praying for the killer to shove his drill into her mouth as soon as possible.

""Slumber Party Massacre"" offers nothing new to the slasher genre. The script is so basic, a high school student could have written it. None of the performances stand out, and the villain is lame. There are the usual false scares, some female nudity and the body count grows ridiculously high in a very short period of time. Everything is just so bland here it makes ""Pieces"" look like ""Gone With the Wind"".  There's a hilarious on-camera goof during the big thunderstorm when the lightning crackles across the sky but the peal of thunder is out-of-sync and doesn't match what's on-screen. The viewer is offered no background on the killer's motivation, besides the fact he escaped from prison after murdering five people thirteen years earlier.  At least Mrs. Voorhees had a reason for offing those horny kids at Camp Crystal Lake, etc.

The one thing I did enjoy was the score. From the opening scene with its over-the-top menacing organ music to the campy synth sounds later on. It sounds like something John Waters would have used if he'd made a horror movie.

The retrospective on the first disc gathers a few actors, the director and various others to discuss the film's legacy. It's not boring, but some of them take it way too seriously and heap way too much praise on this picture.

Overall, a disappointment. If you want something from the same era but much more fun and entertaining, check out ""Pieces"", ""Curtains"", or ""Happy Birthday to Me"".",1289692800,2,2429,4.8478260869565215

Factory keeps consistantly blowing me away with their breathtaking, film geek-friendly releases of content ranging from popular cult TV like ""MST3K"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" to the ""Gamera"" monster film series and the seemingly non-stop ""Roger Corman Collection"". Here, they release the infamous, beloved ""Slumber Party Massacre"" trilogy for the first time on DVD for horror fans everywhere. All 3 films come complete with all-new commentaries, as well as photo galleries and a ""making of"" feature and a trailer for the first film. Good stuff.

""The Slumber Party Massacre"" (1982)- A jean coat-wearing, drill-toting maniac escapes from a mental institution and makes his way to a slumber party being held by cheery, athletic girls. Who will come out alive?! Infamously developed from a screenplay by femenist Rita Mae Brown, this is a fun thriller that lightly makes fun of the genre, but actually mostly gives us a straightforward classic thanks to a number of darkly comical moments, likable characters, and some gooey death scenes. Reccomended viewing for all slasher and horror fans.

""Slumber Party Massacre II"" (1987)- An all-girl rock band, including a survivor of the first film, head up to a high-class neighborhood for a weekend of practice and good old fun. But the survivor suffers from increasingly bizzare nightmares and visions, including a punk rock reincarnation of the previous film's killer, who may or may not really be coming to get them. Here it is, the infamous SPM sequel. Infamous, for it's sequence of events and ending(s) which considerably blur the lines of reality. It is because of this reason that SPM2 is my least favorite of the series. The ending whole is like a big, convoluted middle finger to the audience, who has been waiting patiently for nearly 40 MINUTES for any sort of major horror content; much before that is made up of semi-comical teen antics. On the upside however, we're treated to more gory kills and other wild makeup FX concerning the survivor's grisly hallucinations, more likable characters, and a scene-chewing, only occasionally annoying killer who wields a stupidly over-the-top but memorable take on the first movie's murder weapon, all of it adding to the film's zany but still overall nonsensical atmosphere. Worth a watch, but don't expect your typical slasher movie.

""Slumber Party Massacre III"" (1990)- In this quasi-remake of the first SPM, a group of lovely young ladies have a slumber party to top off a long day of beach volleyball and staring at boys. But one by one they get knocked off by another drill-toting maniac who seems to be any one of more than a few unexpected guests. Made long after the slasher genre hit rock bottom, SPM3 is still a suprisingly decent followup to the last two movies. Although the acting is a bit more sub-par and and the death scenes not quite as elaborate, the characters are still a cute and likable group of close-nit girls. Most notable about this entry, however, is its dark feel. SPM3 abandons the darkly comical nature of the first movie and the surreal zaniness of the second in favor of a more grim tone, packing in sadistically prolonged death scenes, girl beatings, and even an attempted rape, making easily the darkest of the trilogy. Regardless, despite the darker, cheaper feel, it's still a good watch and is a good look at what some slasher movies were like past their prime.",1286841600,18,3418,4.982486865148862

These disks haven't been released yet - but I've heard Shout Factory has beautifully restored them - and I own the unrated (and rated cuts) of these classics on DVD and VHS. I've also taken a look at the special features - which are plentiful.

I rate them (in order):

Slumber Party Massacre
Slumber Party Massacre 3
Slumber Party Massacre 2

I'm sure some will disagree with that assessment; but this review is to entice some folks who aren't familiar with this series to GET THEMSELVES ACQUAINTED - and the price is so great - why NOT order this collection???? These are CLASSIC cheesy flicks that inspired TONS of knock-offs and spin-offs.

And for those who are interested; here's my rankings of the ""Slumber Party""/""Sorority House"" Massacre series - best to worst with star rankings out of five (knock-off's and spin-offs included):

""Slumber Party Massacre"" (1982) - ***** The Original and Best - Brinke is HOT here in her cameo. A classic 80's slasher to go down in history.
""Sorority House Massacre"" (1986) - ****1/2 Starts off slow - and then has an amazing finale. A great spin-off.
""Spring Break Massacre"" (2008) - ****1/2 - Cheap for sure. But a welcome movie that was a BIG step-up from ""Cheerleader Massacre"". Linnea Quigley and Reggie Bannister are WELCOME anytime.
""Hard to Die"" (1990) - **** - The unofficial ""Sorority House Massacre 3"" - but it contains stock footage from ""Slumber Party Massacre""? This one is so-bad-it's-good - and knew it. I LOVE this lousy clone of ""Die Hard"". Great fun. Forrest J. Ackerman has an amazing cameo.
""Slumber Party Massacre 3"" (1990) - **** - Great fun. LOVED the next-door-neighbor with the telescope. Hope the re-release DVD is Unrated - because the New Concorde DVD I own is EDITED!!!! Still holding on to my VHS.
""Sorority House Massacre 2"" (1990) - ***1/2 - CHEAP - but great fun. So-Bad-It's-Good in many ways. Boom mics and blood bottles throughout. Worth a purchase at a reasonable price for sure.
""Slumber Party Massacre 2"" (1987) - *** - Kinda a rip off of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" that doesn't make sense. Though Points for the killer with the drill in his guitar.
""The Last Slumber Party"" (1988) - A knock-off that's so-bad-it's-good. Terrible film stock. Atrocious gore effects - but laugh out loud funny :-)
""Cheerleader Massacre"" (2003) - **1/2 - LAME movie. Bad Video. Worth a rent or purchase (if cheap). Glad it wasn't an official sequel.

The graininess of this 1982 classic is what I really look for when I watch an old horror slasher flick and in that aspect it's all there.  There is some classic nudity scenes that you would expect in any genre specific horror film or comedy spoof of the 80's.  I like the plot, classic escaped convict wanting revenge, there just so happens to be a slumber party happening where he is roaming.  The drill bit was a new take at the time since the chainsaw, machete and knives made their mark and oversaturated the horror genre.  The acting is bad, which is good for a feature like this and it containes the gore glut that has made this a classic and is still a pricy buy on e-bay and Amazon since having been discontinued from New Concorde.

What drew me to this film is of course the cover art or one sheet that was provided to cinema's back when it came out.  It is nearly one of the best of it's kind.

Enjoy this film.  Don't expect it to be the best horror film of it's generation but it is a good time and remember that it is considered to be a horror classic.

Adding a bit humour is great for a slasher film and it didn't add over the top humour which doesn't need to be in a slasher film in my opinion. You have to have the scenes that scare you,but also have a little ""dark"" humour.
The directing and writing is amazing for a slasher film. Sure we have had great slashers before and after,but to have a slasher written and directed by women is awesome. The acting was awesome. I had no problem with any bad acting at all in the film. The storyline was great and I really enjoy the fact you don't know much about the killer himself. It leaves him dark and somewhat a mystery. The girls in the film seemed for most part to have their own personalities,but you did have the somewhat mean girl who didn't like the new girl.

1106229,5,6305976384,"One of the teenage prankster voyeurs in this movie, when spying on the girls undressing, utters, ""I think I died and went to heaven.""  I feel the same way about ""Slumber Party Massacre"" -- it is 77 minutes of slasher movie heaven.  It's so fun to watch. I never get tired of it.

The plot concerns an escaped lunatic sporting a giant power drill stalking a group of girls at a late night slumber party.  The fact that they're all members of a high school basketball team allows an ample opportunity for an after-practice shower scene with generous amounts of nudity.  That is just one area where this movie delivers the goods far more than most slashers even of its time -- in fact you know you're in good hands when there is nudity to boot in the first five minutes.

And all the girls are gorgeous, but particularly Kim (Debra Deliso) and of course principle player Trish (Michelle Michaels).  (I even found Pamela Roylance as the basketball coach to be attractive in an older woman kind of way.)

You name it, this movie has it.  There is beer drinking, weed toking (the girls apparently get the munchies from Kim's bag of ""Maui wowie"" and decide to order a pizza), and abundant full color gore.

But at the heart of it, having been written and directed by women, this movie captures common experiences of teenage girls (like gossip and slumber parties) dead on.  I found the relationship and banter between  Valerie (Robin Stille) and kid sister Courtney (Jennifer Meyers) particularly endearing, as Val is excluded from her teammates' slumber party and instead is forced to spend the night kid-sitting and making sugary Kool-Aid.

And I absolutely love how this one pays almost reverential homage, scene for scene, to the earlier ""Halloween.""  But that is a film that deserves such treatment and it's clear that ""Slumber Party Massacre"" is an ultra-hip throwback to John Carpenter's masterpiece, made by its fans for fans.  A perfect example is Robin Stille as Valerie being cast in the shy wallflower Jamie Lee Curtis role, even down to wearing the same type of long dress and carrying her books the same way while sauntering home after school, though the cold October air of Midwestern Haddonfield is replaced by the palm trees of sunny Southern California.  The key difference though between this and Carpenter's film is that ""Slumber Party Massacre"" is played for fun and clearly doesn't take itself at all seriously.

Despite what some have said I think the DVD picture is good.  It's an enduring print for this vintage '82 classic.  And I thank the good Lord they kept the original movie poster for the cover, unlike the current trend for slasher DVD reissues to replace it with something polished and bland and updated.  The reason being, this one has one of the all-time great posters for an exploitation film, right up there with ""Ilsa, She-Wolf of the S.S.""  The girls on it are so sexy they're on fire.

At the time of this review this gem is out of print again and becoming hard to find and demands another reissue.  But get it however you can, it's among the best slashers ever.",1207353600,2,3096,4.713754646840148

A girl holds a slumber party and a maniac on the loose comes to the house and tries to kill them all. That's it. Yup, that really is it. Along the way we see lots of shots of the girls getting undressed which are so obvious and blatant that I would have taken them as evidence that this really was a send-up of the genre, if the rest of the film wasn't so painfully and boringly routine.

Every horror cliche is here, and not a single thing happens that has not been seen in countless other movies. There's no earthly reason for the girls to carry on falling prey to the killer once they realise that something is wrong. He's only one man, for gawd's sake, and there are loads of possible exits from the large house they are staying in.

The acting is also rubbish, and the maniac killer has no back story to explain his behaviour, he just exists to terrorize the girls. I wouldn't even say that the female cast is that attractive, but if you don't really care as long as you see lots of topless shots, you should be happy here.

The story (at the time) was pretty unique and not one too much, the story was also pretty good. The blood and gore wasn't overdone and still pretty good. There were alot of nods to Halloween and Friday The 13th which I really liked. The ""bimbo"" actresses added nothing to the movie, but being able to watch them die one-by-one was very fulfilling.

[the bad]

Since the killer was shown right away, it took alot of the power from this film. I believe it would have worked much better if they kept him a mystery until the ending, this way anyone could have been a suspect. Bad acting comes with the territory of these sort of films, and aside from a few people this is no different. The method of killing was a bit ""stupid"" so to speak, a drill is a great weapon, but the one used was obviously a pwer drill that was never plugged in. Lastly, the killer was not intimidating at all and at times really lame.

[final thoughts]

Like most bad movies in this genre being very fun to watch for the cheese factor, this was no different. The movie is in no ways bad, and actually somewhat good. There were some jaw-dropping kills, nudity and blood. What else can a slasher-genre fan want? A worthwhile plot? --It has one too.

And sho `nuff, here comes some more T & A...not bad, not bad at all...although I have to say, the girls shower talk wasn't as titillating as I'd hoped...Trish spreads the word to her friends about a `girls' only slumber party, and even invites the new girl, Valerie (Stille), despite some of Trish' friends snobby objections (Val heard the snide remarks and declined).  Fast forward into the early evening and a couple of victims later (the killer appear early, and often), the small group of girls gather at Trish's, and two school mates/jokesters named Jeff (Millbern) and Neil (Johnson) show up (on their cool, ten speed bicycles) to peep through a window and see the girlies change into their nighties...but they're not the only male presence lurking about...seems the killer, who's claimed a few victims so far, is skulking about somewhere...a point which becomes deathly apparent when the pizza delivery man shows up his eyeballs literally drilled from his head (lovely).  Well, at least the pizza is free...

If I learned anything from this movie, it's that feminists probably shouldn't make slasher films...but, it should be known that Brown's original treatment got worked over pretty well, without her input.  Apparently she had originally written the script as a parody, but then the producers decided to play it straight, which, in essence, caused it to come off even more like a parody than it probably would have had they stuck to Brown's original treatment.  The acting isn't very good (the girls, who are all supposed to be high school students, looked a bit old), the script pretty awful, the characters exceptionally lame, the scene adequately films, but nearly always lacking in any kind of suspense...somewhere I saw stated the film had `lots of gore', which I didn't think was true.  There was some, but it hardly qualified to me as `lots'.  There was, however, a lot of supposed gore, in that we watch sequences leading up to what will most likely be a gory ending for a victim, but then the camera shifts away and we're left to fill in the rest using our imaginations, aided by the subsequent grisly sound effects (the sound effect of the drill being used on various individuals was actually quite good, in a wet and crunchy sort of way).  Was the lack of real gore done for artistic reasons?  I doubt it...probably more so because they didn't have the dough to follow these things all the way through, especially given the film was released by Roger Corman's New Concorde Pictures (Corman always embraced the essence of frugality in filmmaking).  If you're a fan of the T & A, you will find some worthy scenes up front, but don't expect a whole lot more later on as the cornucopia of boobage dries up pretty quickly.  The body count in this film runs fairly high (I counted 12 in all), and leads to a humorous aspect (intentional or not) of the killer running out of places to stack the corpses.  I was kinda annoyed with the character of the killer, as he appears to be just your average, garden-variety, homicidal, psycho manic.  If there was a particular motive for him attacking these girls, I missed it.  Normally these films offer some sort of connection, often times completely stupid and from left field, but, at least its something...here there was nothing...well, I take that back, he did think they were pretty, and wanted to give them love (his interpretation of love is a lot different than mine), but still, it felt like a key element was missing.  In defense of the director, Ms. Jones, this was her first film, as prior she was an editor for Corman, until gave her the directing reins.  She has since moved on to better things, writing and directing films like Maid to Order (1987) and The Rich Man's Wife (1996).

The widescreen (1.85:1) picture on this DVD looks reasonably decent, but I did notice what appeared to be quite a bit of dust and dirt on the print, along with the effects of age (white specking, and such).  Not a very clean print, but watchable...the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo came through pretty well, although it did seem some audio portions were softer than others.  As far as special features, there's a trailer for this film, along with one for the sequel Slumber Party Massacre II (1987), and Sorority House Massacre (1987), but they curiously neglected to include one for Slumber Party Massacre III (1990).  Also included are biographies for some of the cast, along with Corman himself...one thing that always irked me within these bios for Corman is how they make it appear like he actually discovered all the talent they say he has over the years...when you've produced some 400 to 500 films, you're bound to have hired people who have since gone on to bigger and better things.  Now, certainly, I acknowledge Corman may have gave these individuals an opportunity and possibly their start in the business, but I doubt it was due to the fact that he thought they had talent and/or potential, but more so due to the fact they would work cheap...well, Corman never seemed one to shirk away from taking credit, whether he deserved it, or not...

1106351,1,6305976384,"I remember seeing this movie when I was real little but could not remember much. I just knew there was a drill involved. When the IFC channel recently had their ""80's Slasher Flashback"" marathon the other night, I caught this one and another one. As I watched this film, I realized why I couldn't remember it. Why would anyone want to remember this?. In past reviews that I have done here at Amazon over the past 4 years or so, I have been pretty kind to some bad movies. Why?. Because they were decently done, fun and entertaining, and were some of my favorites. As I began to think of reviewing this particular movie, I kept thinking of how to rate it. This is, without any doubt, a one star movie. There is no question about that. Maybe one star is actually a bit too kind, really. But I have given other movies that would probably be a one star movie by anyone else two or three stars. But as I thought of my impending review for this movie I realized that this is a movie that deserves nothing more than a one star rating. There is no way around it. No extra stars for gore or nudity. One star. So, what about the movie itself?. Where to start!. Even if you didn't see the credits and had no idea who wrote and directed this film, it won't come to any surprise that it was written by a female(activist Rita Mae Brown), and directed by one(Amy Jones, who went on to family friendly fare with duties on the a number of the recent direct to video ""Beethoven"" sequels). The simple premise is that 18 year old Trish(Michele Michaels) is going to be all alone at her house for the weekend as her parents go out of town. She decides to have a slumber party with a few of her closest friends to keep her company. How perfect!. At the same time, murderer Russ Thorn escapes and sets his eyes on the small group of ladies as he plans to dissect and dismember them with his hand held power drill. The symbolism of the male human and certain parts are not done too subtley. Take for instance when Valerie swings her machete and chops a good portion of his drill off. What do you think that stood for?. If screenwriter Rita Mae Brown was originally writing this as a spoof and a look at how these kinds of movies glorify women and violence, her message came across pretty blandly. And her work was awful. She should stick to novels. The writing was horrible. The dialogue was clunky, cheesy, and stupid. Brown doesn't seem to have any clue on how to set up a solid situation or scene. Her stalking and ""scare"" scenes were watered down versions of the real thing. She has no talent for setting up scares or tension or suspense. It also waters things down when your killer is very visible, seen a lot, and looks like a truck driver hanging out at your local roadside bar. Plus, he runs like a sissy. Director Amy Jones doesn't do things better either. The direction is sloppy and many scenes seem and feel like afterthoughts instead of a coherent scene. And then there is the cast and the acting. Most of the acting is pretty bad. I think high school productions would of done a much better job. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the first movie, or acting job in general, for a lot of the people in the cast. It was all very amateurish. A few of them acting as if this was all normal and not a big deal. I especially liked the part where Val comes racing out of the basement with her machete to stop the killer, but stops long enough to close the basement door!. There were only two moments in the movie that were funny, and seemed to be ""intentionally"" funny. One was with Jackie getting hungry and eating the pizza from the dead pizza delivery guy, and the other was Kim who thought Val was behind this and saying that this was ""an extreme overreaction for not being invited to the party"". The only one here who does a decent enough job is Robin Stille, who played Valerie. She was not great, but she was the only one here I liked. Sadly, Stille committed suicide in 1996. Then there is her little sister Courtney, played by Jennifer Meyers. She seemed to be as old as the other girls, but was trying to be a little girl. Not only was she annoying, but she was kinda creepy too. The killer is a joke. He looks like an idiot, and it's acting on the seriously hammy side. What does the movie have going for it that people will like?. Well, it has about 11 deaths(12 counting Thorn), and there is blood and gore. But the deaths are ruined with the horrible executions of the scenes. And there is nudity. If I were seeing this in 1982 or a little after, I would be beside myself. Since it is 2005 and this was in 1982, the nudity here didn't work for me. The score is pretty cheesy too. The music was done by someone named Ralph Jones. Uh huh. It had traces of some of the themes in the original ""Halloween"", which this movie obviously stole some things from. All in all, this is an incredibly bad movie that was made and acted by people who don't seem to know anything about filmmaking or how to make a horror/slasher film. The only good thing I got out of this movie is that it's so ridiculously bad and stupid, I got a good laugh.",1125273600,,5124,4.294421487603306
1106352,4,6305976384,"This movie I never saw and the other nite it came on the Independant Film channel, and I watched, and enjoyed it. I also won't go througha summary of what the movie is about as more than plenty of people have.

First of all the acting is not bad and quit good, not cheesy just naturally good, there is also a decent amount actually quit a bit of nudity which is always a plus in horror movies.

But what made this move so good in my opinion was the high ratio of kills of about 12 or so and 3/4 of them are quit graffic and in detail, so that is what really gives this movie such a good rating, a good slasher flick to have in any collection, I think any fans of 70's and 80's horror like myself will appreciate this for what it is. Its a good fun time of murder. Well any fan of slasher flicks should get this.",1125187200,,811,3.9693251533742333

Some of the dialogue is corny, and some of the actions are unreal, but there is always something else in the movie that can make up for that.

It's about a group of high school girls having a slumber party. The usual thing is at the slumber party: drugs, alchohal, and guys trying to get in with the girls. When a killer arrives, everything goes wrong as this group of teenagers run for their lives. This movie has stylish murders and other fun yet thrilling things in it. It's actually pretty good, even if you want to make fun of it, it's always a pleasure to watch.",1113004800,2,749,4.420289855072464
1106354,4,6305976384,"Slumber Party Massacre is a masterpiece.  You think I'm kidding?  Well, I'm not.  As far as slashers go, this one was near prefect-not for the gore or killing scenes, but for its ultra formulaic approach.

When a bad movie is made by people who think it's actually good, then it usually sucks.  But when a bad movie is made by filmmakers who know it's bad and cheesy, then usually it turns out to be a gem.

In Slumber Party Massacre-the formula couldn't be more simple.  Killer is loose, kills young girls, two survive.  The end.  Now usually I would be upset at a movie that just revamps the same old ideas.  But the filmmakers of this movie knew they were following the formula, and exploited and made it more obvious as the movie played.

With at least 10 fake freak-out scare moments (cat jumping out, guy scares girl instead of killer...etc.) this movie almost becomes a parody of the genre.  The killer in this movie uses a drill.  In one moment, our heroin approaches a door when out of nowhere a drill comes through the wall.......................only to reveal it's a lady on the other side, installing a peep hole.  Now that's a long way to go for a fake freak out moment, but if you know they genre, that's the kind of crap that happens all the time.  There must have been twenty moments of ""Who's there?""  Or  ""What's that noise.""  By the film's end, another noise is heard off screen and the girl says ""Not again.""  Another example these filmmakers were making fun of themselves.

Like any good cult movie, this film pays homage to the classics that came before it.  A girl watches an old scary movie (one I've never seen) and certainly the film's beginning is an obvious tip of the hat to the very first slasher movie in 1963 from director Herschell Gordon Lewis-""Blood Feast..""  In that film, we see a 60's style radio and a voice from a newscaster reporting on a killer being loosed.  In Slumber Party Massacre, we get the exact same thing-with a damn close replica of the radio used in ""Blood Feast.""  If this is pure coincidence, I would be very surprised.

Slumber Party Massacre isn't the goriest of slahsers.  In fact, it's pretty tame, but its overly formulaic approach makes it noteworthy and very entertaining.  Within the first five minutes, we had boobs and blood.  That's how it's done.",1110844800,3,2314,4.591687041564792
1106425,5,6305976384,"I love this movie! The fact that the killer is not trying to lurk in shadows but running right out in the open is PISSA!

1106426,5,6305976384,"The early 1980s were a great time for the slasher film genre, as every hardcore horror fan knows, and one of the best of these efforts was a nasty little gem called ""Slumber Party Massacre."" Thanks to the wonders of DVD, we can revisit such gruesome shockers whenever we want to without trudging off to the local video store only to learn that they don't carry anything other than ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th."" Remember those desperate days? I essentially quit watching horror films for several years because I couldn't find anything decent in town and was unwilling to spend thousands of dollars on out of print VHS tapes. Not anymore. Now I can plunk down a few dollars and walk away with Joe D'Amato's finest, peruse at my leisure any of Dario Argento's grotesque gialli, relive the awesome experience of watching that girl and her digestive tract in Lucio Fulci's ""The City of the Living Dead"" (widescreen with awesome sound no less), or systematically work my way through the prime years of the American slasher film. The latter category includes the juicy cut of warped depravity that is ""Slumber Party Massacre,"" an all-American jaunt into the deepest recesses of a genre that rarely seeks to do anything beyond slice and dice its characters in imaginative ways.

What you have here is your standard ""nutcase escapes the loony bin and goes on a rampage"" horrorfest. Hardly original, I grant you, but in this case highly effective nonetheless. The Mark David Chapmanish fellow in ""Slumber Party Massacre"" turns out to be the bug eyed Russ Thorn (Michael Villela), just your everyday upstanding citizen who used a drill to dispatch a bunch of poor souls back in the day. Now he's on the loose and determined to start working again just as soon as he can find a new consignment of victims on which to ply his skills. We come into the film at a local high school, where a bunch of female basketball players plans to throw a slumber party that very night. Just in case you're not smart enough to know these are athletes, we see the hardworking gals putting in some serious time on the court with Coach Jana (Pamela Roylance) before hitting the showers. In the locker room we meet the most important character, the new girl in town Trish (Michele Michaels), and a few of the snobbier members of the team. Trish wants to go to the party but isn't sure she will fit in. Besides, she angered some of her fellow teammates by performing well on the court.

Meanwhile, Thorn is already claiming his first victims. He kills a blonde repairwoman right under the noses of a couple of dorky guys on the school grounds in a nicely executed scene before stalking Linda (Brinke Stevens) in the locker room after school. Or was it Linda first and the blonde second? No matter, really. The two crimes serve the purpose of establishing how utterly dangerous this chap is with tools. He picks up a twelve-inch drill along the way, which will act as his primary method of destroying the human race one woman at a time. Then comes the slumber party with all its adolescent antics. The girls giggle, cackle over their guy friends, and nearly get into trouble with the neighbor who drops in to check on them. Thorn turns up to take part in the fun, working his way through the nosy neighbor, turns the pizza delivery guy into a sieve, and wipes out several other minor characters. Trish pops into the picture for a variety of reasons. One, she lives right across the street from the slumber party. Two, her annoying Joanie Cunningham wearing hot shorts sister Courtney (Jennifer Meyers) encourages her to partake in the festivities. Three, the movie wouldn't work without a courageous heroine arriving to save the day. The conclusion turns into a real bloodbath, what with the discovery of all those bodies and the showdown between Thorn and Trish.

""Slumber Party Massacre"" works so well for one simple reason: this is a movie that is all about atmosphere. After all, the gore really isn't spectacular, not comparable in anyway to what we've seen in gorier slashers like ""The Prowler,"" or your typical Italian gorefest, or a number of other extreme films. And the acting, with a few exceptions, is corny and what you would expect from a low budget horror film. No, this movie succeeds because of darkened rooms, darker streets, pitch-black backyards, and the relentless, single minded stalk and slash methods of Russ Thorn. He's a truly frightening lunatic dedicated to the proposition that every living being within his reach should perish horribly at the end of a sharp instrument. Thorn remains silent for most of the picture, but provides one of the most humorous scenes in the film when he finally speaks and we find out he sounds a lot like Truman Capote with a bad head cold. After you stop laughing at this point, you realize ""Slumber Party Massacre"" wins the day. Even the picture transfer on the DVD, a rather grainy and dark transfer, lends a certain panache to the proceedings.

Extras. Filmographies for some of the actors, trailers for this film, ""Slumber Party Massacre II,"" ""Sorority House Massacre II,"" (which cribs footage from this movie!) and a widescreen picture transfer find there way onto the disc. I don't think we'll ever see all the slasher films of this era come out on DVD, but that shouldn't stop us from appreciating what we get. Watching films like this one leaves me nostalgic for the old days, before shot on video productions and cheesy CGI effects replaced good old fashioned hard work. Give this one a go soon.",1096934400,6,5533,4.754422476586889

One scene that stands out is when a pizza delivery man is killed right in front of the girls at their home with a knife in his back (or something like that) but rather than be afraid like LOGICAL people, they go ahead and EAT their pizza using the dead guy as a table! It was bizarre and ridiculous which is what made it comical. So that is the kind of movie, you'll be getting. I'm definitely not giving this 3 stars because of content.

1106429,5,6305976384,"Here is a terrific flick in my collection (I only review what I own) that I wanted to review. So lets get down to it!
Trish Devereaux invites her basketball teammates over her house for a slumber party one evening. The party is crashed by Neil and Jeff, two horny 17-year-olds, However, little does she know, mass murderer Russ Thorn has escaped from a mental institution and has decided to crash her party as well...with his oversized ""crotch-like"" drill (You know what I mean!). Like what a total creep! For sure! (Sorry, I had to use my 80s lingo). Well, their only hope for getting out alive is by going across the street to laughing stock, teammate Valarie's house. (She denied the invite when she heard some of the girls teasing her) The thing is, each of them is starting to die quickly and if they don't get out alive, their weekend is going to be a total bummer. (Here I go again).
Needless to say, SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE is a fantastic film. The idea of using a portable drill is great and the fact that the killer actually talks is a breath of fresh air from the ""quiet, stalking, killing"" murderer. Filled with enough humor to fill a whole 'nother movie, SPM rocks. Pure and simple, it rocks. Valarie may be a joke to some, but it's her who has to save the girls....

1106430,4,6305976384,"I first watched ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" on cable because I happened to catch that women both wrote (Rita Mae Brown) and directed (Amy Holden Jones).  I am surprised that many reviewers criticize this 1982 splatter flick for not reflecting feminist sensibilities, but I have to say that my immediate reaction to the film was that it was different from the tradition being established by ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and their host of immitators.  Yes, early on in the film there is a shower scene and this provides a perfect opportunity to figure out which one of these young women is the ""good girl"" who is going to be alive at the end of the film.  However, all those who enjoyed how ""Scream"" both honored and subverted the rules of this particular genre should appreciate that this film does the same thing.  In fact, I am going to go way off on a sociological limb and argue that ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" is indeed a feminist splatter flick.
We all know that the supposed sub-text of slasher films is that those who have unsafe sex are (literally) risking their lives.  Laurie Strode remains the icon good girl, who survives in the original ""Halloween"" because she is a virgin and therefore not sneaking around with her boyfriend while a killer is in the house (forget for a minute the ""Halloween II"" revelation that Laurie and Michael Myers are siblings).  Even though she is a straight-arrow of the group, she is part of the group.  Here friends hold out hope for her getting a date (remember Ben Craemer?).  Her girl friends die because they are preoccupied with sex.
However, in ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" the good girl is much more than a virgin.  Yes, Val Bates (Robin Stille) has the requisite purity to survive the coming massacre (she drinks too much milk, the others complain), but she is also the new girl in town and ostracized by the rest of the girls because she is a better basketball player than any of them.  Consequently, the girls at the slumber party are guilty of turning their backs on the one person who could keep some of them alive by the end of the movie.  I do not want to give away too much, even when talking about a predictable slasher flick like this one, but look at not only who is alive at the end of this film but why, and what they do to be the ones standing.  Look at that and tell me that at least on same level there is not a message on the inherent strength of sisterhood somewhere at the side of that pool.
As the title indicates the idea here is that a bunch of senior high girls are throwing a slumber part just like the ones they enjoyed when they were younger.  The party is at the house of Trish (Michelle Michaels), whose parents are away.  The house is right across the street from where Val is taking care of her kid sister, Courtney (Jennifer Meyers).  To this mix we add two guys (David Millbern and Joseph Allen Johnson) who want to crash the party and play some tricks on the unsuspecting scantily clad girls, and an escaped mental patient, named Russ Thorn (Michael Villella), who has followed the girls home from practice and has a tool box.  This particular toolbox is full of tools, but this guy really, really likes his power drill.
Pointing out that this film has bad dialogue, lousy acting, gratuitous nudity, and most of the killing scenes are too dark to really see anything, seems well beside the point.  Those are relatively standard fare in splatter flicks, especially in the decade of the 1980s.  The point is that all things considered ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" is an above average slasher movie, which is not saying much until you remember how made the average slasher film was during the gory days of the genre.  Besides that, I have to say that in the absence of a concrete idea of what truly ""feminist"" splatter flick would be like, there is a decidedly different ""message"" built into this film that does make it stand out from its contemporaries.
There are two more films in this series as it heads quickly downhill.  Some of the characters from this one pop up in ""Slumber Party Massacre 2,"" although played by different actresses (such as Crystal Benard), but basically they are low-grade films that spend more time on the ""Slumber Party"" parts of the title than the ""Massacre.""  ""Cheerleader Massacre"" is supposedly the fourth film in the series, but by that point the people making these movies have pretty much forgotten they are supposed to be splatter flick and are trafficking in softcore porn.  Watch this one if you are so inclined and then move on to better things.  They are hard to find when you are talking splatter flicks, but they are out there.",1069113600,19,4653,4.592995169082125

The girls are part of a high school basketball team and the one holding the party is Trish (Michelle Michaels) There's also the girl next door, who's sort of a teacher's pet, and a weirdo neighbor who's obviously just there for the body count.
Yeah, that's about it for plot.  But what part of what makes Slumber Party Massacre enjoyable schlock is the fact that it's written and directed by women, feminists no less.  And the movie they've crafted is really no different than anything a male director would have come up with.  Most of the female cast are damsels in distress (there are a few exceptions), there's gratuitous nudity, and typical genre cliches that rely mostly on characters acting extremely stupid.
But that's expected in a slasher, and as long as the movie's entertaining and not that poorly made, than it's passable, which is the case here.  Heck, there are even a few suspenseful moments here and there, amazingly enough.  I can only imagine that the attempted scares would have probably been more effective if the killer were given a mask of some sort (seeing his face dampens any effect of terror) or if he used a weapon other than a lousy drill... The stalk and slash scenes are nothing spectacular.  Halloween or even Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter this is not.  But they're reasonably effective for what they are, thanks to tons of blood and gore and some good jump-in-your-seat shocks.  The movie runs at a pretty fast pace, and at 76 minutes, runs quick without being too big a waste of time.  Slumber Party Massacre isn't a good movie, but I know I sure had a good time.",1036886400,5,1804,4.638364779874214
1106516,3,6305976384,"I think this movie was funny. I Love horror Movies alot, especially movies from the 1980's such as this one. This movie is about a killer who escaped from a mental hospital. A girl decides to have a ""just girls"" slumber party, not knowing about the psycho that escaped. obviously, you know whats going to happen. overall, this movie was pretty good.",1035849600,,349,4.645161290322581
1106517,3,6305976384,"First and foremost I'd like to say if you're looking for a movie with a deep plot and good acting then you need look elsewhere. However, if your a fan of the typical 80's slasher films (partying teens, a little T & A, some bad acting and a maniacal killer on the loose) then you've got yourself a great movie.
By looking at the cover and the title of the film you may think that there is a lot of nudity and sexual scenes. In actuality, there really isn't as much as you might think. As one reviewer before me said there are really only four scenes.
Other than that, there is a pretty high body count and some decent killing scenes, all and all it's not a great horror movie but I've certainly seen worse. If your looking for a good time invite a couple of the guys over, pop open a 12 pack of brew,  check out Slumber Party Massacre and enjoy.",1028764800,5,844,4.146341463414634
1106518,2,6305976384,"The name of the movie, the cover of the box, and especially all these reviews, might lead you to believe this is some kind of softcore porn movie. I may very well be the only person on earth to say this... but this movie DOES NOT have TONS of nudity in it. As far as I can tell, it has four of those scenes. A girl getting dressed... the girls showering, the girls changing for the party, and a girl making out with her boyfriend (he feels her nude breast). There is also a male [rear] shot in a magazine, but I won't count that. There is no actual ""sex scene"" or anything so I can't help but wonder why all these reviewers can't help but talk about the nudity. I'm a huge horror buff, and have seen alot more nudity in other 80's flicks. I can't believe this movie is somewhat ""famous"" for it.
The nudity that it does have IS definitely gratuitous (while the girls chat in the gym shower, the camera lowers and focuses and their butts for a while)
Now...as for the movie itself: it's kind of hard not to bash it, because it's not a horrible movie... but most of all it is NOT a good movie. This movie shows us how a flick can be cheesy in a bad way. It's like they just didn't try hard enough.
But I guess it's not a COMPLETE waste of time... especially considering how short it is... (77 min)
You have to be as open minded as possible.",1024185600,4,1337,4.126436781609195
1106519,2,6305976384,"Okay..a lot of 80's slasher movies are tacky and fun but this movie is just boring. The story is perfect for a horror movie but this one just dragged on forever. A lot of the film is made up of nude girls and stupid killer who just happens to stumble across a group of teens and decide he wants to kill them - for no reason. At least in films like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street the killer kills for a reason. Mrs Vorhees wants revenge on camp counsellors because her son was killed while in their care and Freddy was burned alive and wants revenge on the people in Elm Street - this killer has no reason for killing these teens.
There are moments where the movie picks up but it's too little too late. I wish I could say I liked this movie but this movie is definately staying at the back of my collection along with other tragic ones.",1018051200,2,849,4.151515151515151
1106520,4,6305976384,Slumber Party Massacre is one of the best all around slasher flicks. It's got everything fans of this genre would want to see. Plenty of cleavers and cleavage (so to speak) The plot is very simple and laid out quickly. Great film to watch late at night when there's nothing else to do. Watch it alone or with a group of friends and it's still entertaining. At this price it's definetly a must for your collection.,1017619200,2,413,4.447368421052632
1106521,1,6305976384,"I saw this movie when I was about ten years old and it scared the hell out of me. I saw it agian about a year ago and it is in the top ten of the worst films of all time. As a kid I loved all the nudity and gore. Now it's is really tedious.
 The story is about a killer who escapes from a mental hospital and finds a bunch of girls at a slumber party. Befor getting there he kills a few people.
 First the killer is using a long wall drill that turns very slowly but somehow can slice threw people like a knife. The killer is a short man no more that five five and all of one hundred and twenty pound holding a brick. He is as far from scary as you can get. Forget the fact that every horror movie antic is used in this film, like never calling the police,or leaving the party in a group,tripping women, dead flashlights and the ever popular ""Let's split up.
I am not one to look for 5 star movies all the time and I can enjoy a good slasher film but this one really tests even the most staunch supporter of slasher films. I do wonder who was there movie aimed at? I know that anyone over the age of fourteen will find this to be a foolish film and under that age should not be watching an R rated movie anyway.
Of course this movie is not a new idea and really started with Halloween where a mental patiant escapes from and institution and goes on a rampage. That however was a better film
This movie is good for one thing however. If you are looking for a movie to watch with buddies, or at a party just to laugh at than you should look no further. You have found you'r waste of film......",1016323200,,1591,3.96875

It was boring, had no real story to think of, was poorly lit, poorly edited, poorly acted, and had the lamest 'killer' i have ever seen from the genre. mary poppins would have made a more convincing killer. I would have laughed at him but by the time he started to speak, i was in the other room reading war and peace. ok, i wasn't reading but you get the point.
Ok, here goes. A nut from a mental institution escapes and kills some girls. Real original stuff. Okay, so i think maybe some creative killings, the acting, something can make up for the plot shortcomings. No luck. Unadulterated dreck. Watch it if you must.",1009843200,,647,4.445378151260504
