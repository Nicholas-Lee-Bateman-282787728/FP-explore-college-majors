7936604,4,B00005B1WU,"This DVD is not as much a rip-off as other reviewers may suggest. These are not ""shorts"", but are live-action wrap-arounds for the cartoons they did in 1965. There are 156 cartoons, and 41 wrap-arounds. Obviously, the wrap-arounds were used more than once. The ""Kings Of Laughter"" DVD is meant as a public-domain ""best-of"", which includes some of these wrap-arounds. A few of these are available (with the appropriate cartoons) on the two Rhino DVD's with better picture and sound, but all 41 are on this and ""Funniest....vol. 2"" without the cartoons (which are not very good). The picture and sound could be better, but this is a budget, after all!",1137369600,,649,4.8558558558558556
7936605,1,B00005B1WU,"This DVD by Good Times Home Video has a lot of the same material as in The Three Stooges: Kings of Laughter by the same company. They really shouldn't have tried to cheat customers by doing this.
It is really only for the hardcore 3 stooges fans who have seen absolutely everything else by them. Much of it is pretty sad--only a little bit funny--stuff with recycled routines from earlier moves/shorts. These shorts lack the inspired craziness of some of the earlier movies/shorts had.
Look elsewhere for your 3 stooges fix.",1072051200,,524,4.769230769230769
