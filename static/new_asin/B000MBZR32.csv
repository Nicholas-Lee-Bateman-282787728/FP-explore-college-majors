the person who worked with Mike Austin for 20 some years, Dan Shauger. It might not have been his fault, as this new learning method was applying the 'Austin like swing(Mike Austin-515 yd drive at 64 years old, and was still going over 300 yards in his 70's!).  It is an interesting learning approach to a very good way to swing the golf club.
As I have studied the Mike Austin swing, it could be said that Mike Dunaway is the most famous long driver who has used this method since meeting Mike Austin.
Finally, it is the teaching method that is the highlight, but seeing Mr Dunaway's swing is a treat!",1399680000,,719,4.365671641791045
