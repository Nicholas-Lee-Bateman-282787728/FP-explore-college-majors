5776823,5,B00D7AM2WO,"After Hugh Laurie, I thought NO one would do a goof better, but the young Emsworth is a total pleasure to watch. It is a pure joy to watch his facial expressions and those wonderful words of Wodehouse come out of his mouth. This is beautifully well done series. Stories are not as complex as the original with Fry and Laurie but the joy is still there. Watched two episodes tonight and cant wait to see the rest.

Will there be more I hope? and soon.

Long live P. G. Wodehouse!",1377734400,29,478,4.241758241758242
5776824,5,B00D7AM2WO,"Classic British country humor worth 4.5 stars. More if you like Wodehouse. PG Wodehouse wrote Blandings Castle novels from 1915 to 1975. The stories are family friendly since much of what makes TV and movies adult these days had not become a part of filming topics. This is an interesting representation done for TV with the characters and stories of the zany lot at Blandings. It's good for what it is. It's contemporary produced in a nostalgic Wodehouse way. Filming was done in Northern Ireland countryside, a plus.

Timothy Spall plays Lord Clarence in all episodes, not your brightest Lord of the manor.
Jennifer Saunders is bossy sister Lady Connie, a matchmaker of sorts.
Mark Williams is Beach, butler, and does as good a job as any TV butler.
Jack Farthing is Clarence's son Freddie, womanizer that crashes his car in the same tree each episode.

SDH subtitles for all episodes:
1 Pig-Hoo-o-o-o-ey
Fattest pig award contested & Lord Clarence must get pig Empress porking out. Judge Sir Gregory (Robert Bathurst- Downton Abbey) is the competition and his son (Brendan Patricks- Downton Abbey) is a potential mate for niece Angela.

2 The Go Getter
Connie hires Secretary Baxter (David Walliams, also in 5th ep) to clean up Blandings & Clarence. Freddie tries the dog food biz to get a gal.

3 Lord Emsworth and the Girlfriend
Cockney siblings Gladys & Ern are Blandings `Fresh air for Children' annoying Connie. Will they destroy the fete?

4 Company for Gertrude
Freddie eloped with club dancer Paquita. Don't tell! Niece Gertrude desires to wed Vicar Beefy Bingham, but Connie feels he's too poor.

5 The Crimewave at Blandings
Freddie's debt to a bookie puts his life on the block. Baxter returns as tutor to a grandson who unfortunately brandishes about with an air rifle. Who shot......?

6 Problems with Drink
Freddie falls in sty love with the new, hot proportioned, pig man, Monica, after swearing off women in favor of booze. Visitor Lady Daphne falls for pig Empress  & Clarence. Any wedding bells heard over oinks?

Outrageous comedy, slapstick, crude farm fun, well...all that made PG Wodehouse so successful. No foul language but rated PG for P-ig G-as.
Will there be a season 2? There is plenty of Wodehouse books to draw plot from.",1375401600,32,2254,4.89501312335958
5776825,5,B00D7AM2WO,"We caught this on Acorn TV and were thrilled to see another of our beloved Wodehouse series had been filmed and with a great cast.  Timothy Spall as Lord Emsworth is superb and Mark Williams as butler Beach is a scream.  All nonsense all the time, but with writing that only Wodehouse could produce and the terrific comedic timing of the whole ensemble is a scream.

5776840,1,B00D7AM2WO,"I am sad to say that this absolutely terrible. I love my Wodehouse and went into this with the understanding that it was not really Wodehouse (if Jeeves and Wooster have taught us anything it's the brilliance of using Plum's dialogue in your script). I bought this super cheap and went into it with the expectation that it wouldn't be true to the book characters. I was just looking for some fun british comedy. But it was terrible. Awful. Over acted and over written. I love Jennifer Saunders so much and have Abfab on a general play loop. I love most british comedy, even those that aren't that great. But this was godawful. Try it out for the $5 Amazon charges to stream it, like I did, I suppose, if you are interested (I mean, clearly a lot of people enjoy it based on the reviews). But man, this is awful. In spite of some of the terrible reviews, I bought it. And I can't watch it. I'll go read the Blandings books instead.  So disappointed to report how awful this is. It had so very much potential. Great cast and based on the books of a great author. Not sure what they were thinking.

Wodehouse, and love the Jeeves and Wooster series with High Laurie and Stephen Fry, but despite a stellar cast, I have had a hard time warming up to the characters in Blandings. It's all a bit too frenetic somehow. I almost want to say... overacted. Feels blasphemous to say that about the likes of Timothy Spall, Mark Williams (I love him in Father Brown) and the amazing Jennifer Saunders. It was a surprise to see gorgeous James Norton pop up as a character and display such skill at pig-calling -- what CAN'T he do? -- but overall, I was in no hurry to continue watching the series.",1484006400,3,608,4.389380530973451

I can't say if it's totally faithful to the P.G.Wodehouse books, since I haven't read them yet, but after I watched the series I immediately ordered the Blandings book collection.  Each character is perfectly drawn and hilariously played.  Timothy Spall is brilliant as the eccentric and slightly looney Ninth Earl of Emsworth, and Jennifer Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) plays his overwrought sister to perfection.  Each episode features additional characters that add to the merriment.  Enjoy!",1483920000,,586,5.613636363636363

I own both series 1 and 2. I wish they would make more (with the same cast)! Beach from series 1 is hilarious to watch. His subtle expressions convey so much. I'm a fan of Jeeves and Wooster and this is why I decided to watch Blandings. I like Blandings a bit more. I haven't read the P.G.

Nonetheless, we recall actors Mark Williams and Timothy Spall from several Harry Potter movies, but the real star for me is Jack Farthing as the hapless young Freddie Threepwood, who crashes his car at least once every episode. I don't need to describe the show, which others have done much better than I could; rather, I have to say that Wodehouse comedy is some of the best ever to come from our friends across the pond.

There is just a soupon of extra comedy which may have gone unnoticed in the 3rd episode - Lord Emsworth and the Girlfreind in the matter of the rather irrascable Scottish gardener MacAlister who is actually wearing a kilt with what appears to be the MacNaughten sett rather than MacAlister and the sporran plate sigil while rather blurry looks far more like the MacNaughten tower, which resembles a chess rook more than it does the MacAlister raised hand raising an upright dirk.
Wonder whether this discrepancy was intentional, but it is sort of funny.
The MaNaughten sett is after all, a bit more visually dramatic than the MacAlister sett.
For those who may not be familiar with the terminology, the sett is the color pattern of the kilt and plaid.
It is often repeated in modified form in the hose as well.
The gardener, MacAlister appears to be wearing a military rather than dress sporran, by the way.

The producers seem to have made no effort in any aspect of the production to get the period ""feel""  that is such an essential part of Wodehouse, nor do any of the cast seem to be really trying to play their characters, simply reciting or shouting their lines without much interest for the people they are supposed to be playing.

One of my favorite episodes is ""The Crime Wave at Blandings"". Lord Emsworth's grandson visits for summer break and brings his BB gun. From the the arrival of the humorless tutor/secretary Baxter through the wave of staff resignations, it's open season on the employees at Blandings. Lord Emsworth does provide some rules. It seems shooting Tutors is only cricket if they are climbing drainpipes. ""Tutors are not ground game"". It's simply not sporting.  Lord Emsworth's inability to keep track of events, his creative mangling of names and titles, his affectionate disregard for the opinions of his sister Connie, his devotion to his both his Butler and most of all to his  prize winning sow, ""The Empress"", are as delightful as an evening with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry in the Jeeves and Wooster series.

This program dropped the dry humor aspect and relied on very over-the-top depictions of Wode stories. I have not read these stories, so I cannot tell how close to source the program is. However, although I enjoyed each episode (imagine Jeeves and Wooster on the drug Ecstasy), the series left no permanent mark on my mind (which I consider the sign of a truly good series). This series had a sort of ""Pop Goes the Weasle"" nature to it. Once each episode ended, I found it hard to remember afterwards what happened. Everything is at a very superficial level (no depth to any characters). It plays like a 1930's stage play where the actors perform for the next laugh. I will probably buy future seasons, if forthcoming. However, if you are looking for a program with clever plot twists and dry wit, you will need to look elsewhere.",1400716800,,943,4.652694610778443

The performances here are all top-notch, and the setting is worthy of the name 'Blandings'--that most stately of Britain's stately homes--but anyone familiar with the source material will be disappointed by this incarnation.

Wodehouse's wonderfully deranged plots--as light and yet complex as a gourmet souffle--have been eviscerated.  I understand the elimination of characters to suit limits of time and money, but why on earth anyone felt the need to ADD characters to Wodehouse's original roster is beyond me.  If you have any doubt as to who is not original, look for least convincing characters, speaking the least amusing lines--they are not Wodehouse.

Two of my all-time favorite Blandings stories--'The Go-Getter' and 'Crime Wave at Blandings'--manage to hold on to a reasonable amount of their frothy good humor.  Others--'The Girlfriend' in particular--loses too much.  What is left is a soggy, dispiriting shadow of it's delightful, original self.",1398470400,10,1220,5.252577319587629

5777020,4,B00D7AM2WO,"""Blandings"" is a cobbled-together collection of material from some of PG Wodehouse's short stories. There were some things about the show I loved - most particularly the great acting and the timeless cross 1920s-30s-40s aesthetic. Jack Farthing's stammering portrayal of the younger son of the Castle is nothing short of brilliant and was very satisfying for those of us still pining for Hugh Laurie's fabulous Bertie Wooster.

That said, there are a few defects in Season One of Blandings. The show swings wildly from witty to idiotic to camp, and the repeating jokes about pig farts and hair standing on end left me wincing. (Edit: Season Two is MUCH better!)

5777028,2,B00D7AM2WO,"I love P.G. Wodehouse and all his stories about Blandings Castle, and was very anxious (but apprehensive) to watch the British television series about those stories. It is bad enough that each of the six stories thus far produced were barely half an hour episodes, and so much of the plots and sub-plots were shortened or omitted completely. It is apparent to anyone who has read his books that this series is nothing more than 'bargain basement low budget'. Even the castle grounds pale in comparison to the way in which Wodehouse describes 'the ninth earl's garden of Eden'. The characters themselves are miscast for the most part. Timothy Spall is too short and has too much hair (Lord Emsworth is bald! And there is no sign of his pince-nez). In the BBC radio series the late actor Richard Vernon played an excellent Lord Emsworth; it is that precise portrayal which is needed (and should be required) for 'any' production based on any of these Wodehouse masterpieces! Anything less is 'insulting' to the works, and to the audience! It is a shame that Vernon is not alive today for he was also tall, and bald and for the screen would have had any lover of Lord Emsworth shouting,""Yes, yes!"", and ""Long live the 9th earl!"" at their television sets! Jennifer Saunders is too fat to play Lady Connie Keeble, not tall enough, (and certainly not elegant enough or sophisticated enough!). The character who plays Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe is too tall and thin (Sir Gregory is fat!).  Jack Farthing plays a somewhat effeminate Freddie Threepwood, and although he is good at the part, Freddie may be a lot of things but effeminate he is not! Mark Williams who plays Beach, the butler is very good at his part. Still, there is not enough going on 'in any episode' (Where are all the people?). If a series is going to be made in the future surrounding P.G. Wodehouse's classic, Blandings Castle sagas they really should be at a minimum length of 90-120 minutes to do them, and the brilliant author 'any' justice. If anyone were to watch this series and having never read any of the sagas, surely they would come away thinking, ""What's the big fuss about Wodehouse?""

The adaptation is not clever or funny.  The two stories I watched were highly contorted, and I don't remember Plum resorting to flatulence jokes or caretakers dancing naked on pub tables.  There were several other items inserted into the dialogue that were very much from our time and not the world of Wodehouse.  Besides that, the actors were all stiff and obviously didn't have a feel for the parts.  Freddie was especially appalling, and what was up with his hair?!

Mark Williams by far gave the best performance, but I have to take issue with this interpretation of Beach as being a great deal less dignified and respectful than I remember.

5777048,3,B00D7AM2WO,"This series is at once grand and a disappointment. Despite wonderful and unforgettable characters, particularly Beach the Butler, played by Mark Williams, and Freddie, played by Jack Farthing, and Lord Emsworth, played by Timothy Spall; and despite a seemingly unlimited repertoire of witty remarks, the one thing that can be said without fear of contradiction is that Wodehouse would not have written these scripts. What he did write were a series of light, winsome, innocent novels, and it would be sad if viewers of this series who were new to Wodehouse thought the show accurately reflected his Blandings series.

For here you get the some bits of the novels, but what is missing is the light, winsome, and innocent, adjectives always applicable to the books. So, instead of getting humorous viewing for all the family, you get here the sort of thing that makes BBC America so unwatchable, and for all I know, the real version in the UK is somewhat worse. This is the main reason for buying a series like this on DVD in the first place-- to avoid the tiresome excesses of ill-advised programming on such channels. This series could be saved by a judicious censor, or by inserting a bar of soap in the mouths of certain characters at certain places in the shows, but barring that, I would give this series a miss.

Unimaginable as it seems, for the second time, the British Empire, or the Commonwealth, or whatever it goes by these days, has proven that it doesn't get Wodehouse's brand of gentle slapstick at all. The first time was the ghastly affair of the Berlin broadcasts. The second was and is producing such travesties as this series. Particularly the sixth and last episode in this two disc set is virtually unwatchable and unlistenable. The good news is that there is nothing in the books with this sort of language anywhere. I merely note that, as Wodehouse has outlived many other bad writers, he will outlive these at the BBC or wherever they are who are writing, as Bertie Wooster would say, ""such bilge."" It merely remains to be said, as readers of Wodehouse already know, and which hopefully viewers of these shows will discover, but of which writers of this series are apparently unawares, that to enter the timeless world of Wodehouse's innocent slapstick, one need merely open the books.",1384300800,21,2309,4.81360201511335

5777062,4,B00D7AM2WO,"P.G. Wodehouse was a wellspring of comedy. When someone adapts his works, they have a lot to live up to -- especially after the brilliant ""Jeeves and Wooster"" series.

And while ""Blandings Series 1"" is not comic perfection, it's a funny, light, frothy little sitcom set in a Downton Abbeyesque country estate where wacky things happen on a regular basis -- romantic trials, pig competitions, domineering aunts and the occasional avalanche of dog biscuits. An excellent cast -- including Jennifer Saunders and Timothy Spall -- doesn't hurt either.

Lord Blandings (Spall) is a simple man who loves nothing more than gardening and caring for his prize pig, the Empress. Unfortunately, his officious sister Lady Connie (Saunders) is determined to have Blandings Castle run ""properly,"" and his flaky son Freddie Threepwood (Jack Farthing and a mass of hair gel) brings a bunch of his own problems to the table.

His life is particularly thrown into turmoil when Connie hires a domineering secretary (David Walliams) to sort out his life of pleasant disarray, and it will take the help of the alcoholic manservant Beach (Mark Williams) to thwart him. Also, there are sabotaged pig competitions, pig calls, dog food investments, Portuguese dancers, violent bookmakers, air-guns (in the butt!), London children, and a grasping widow determined to make Lord Blandings her new husband.

Simply put, ""Blandings"" is not quite up to the Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry standard. There's only so much Wodhouseian wackiness you can cram into half an hour. But taken just on its own merits, it's a fun show -- and it has all the Wodehouse staples like scary aunts, clever servants, and an endless stream of nieces and nephews with needlessly complicated love lives.

And it has that lovably bizarre wackiness, with lots of flittering slang-filled dialogue (""I'm stony as Chisel Beach, Beach!"") and a healthy dose of slapstick (everybody shoots Baxter in the butt with an air gun). There are a few subplots that don't quite bloom (the controlling Scottish gardener) but most of them end up twining together nicely, with suitably gooftastic payoffs.

And yes, the cast is the main reason this story works so well. Spall is great as a perpetually bewildered aristocrat who just wants to mess around in his garden and pamper his pig. Saunders is gloriously controlling, but there are a few moments that do make you like Lady Connie despite her flaws, and Farthing is pleasantly flaky as Spall's perennially broke son. The only problem is that Williams seems to fade into the background too much at first, and Beach only comes into his own once he matches wits with Baxter.

""Blandings Series 1"" is just like frolicking in whipped cream -- silly and frothy, with all the staples you expect from a PG Wodehouse story. Here's hoping for a second season.",1378512000,23,2827,5.002127659574468

The Blandings tales span the years, first appearing in 1915, with the last left unfinished with Wodehouse's death in 1975. I was absolutely delighted to learn that the BBC has filmed six episodes and Acorn Media has just released the series based on the inhabitants of Blandings Castle in North America. But, would these beloved characters make the leap to film?

 For those who haven't read the books, Blandings Castle is home to Lord Emsworth, his sister Constance, his butler Beach, his son Freddie and an ever changing rota of relatives, visitors and servants. The DVD series is set in the 1920's.

Timothy Spall (Churchill in The King's Speech) was perfectly cast as the 'lord of the manor' whose preoccupation with his prize pig, The Empress, tops anything else. All he wants is to be left alone to potter in his study or garden. He's quite forgetful and muddles through with the help of Beach. Although, he does wield his lordly influence when necessary. Mark Williams played an admirable butler, with a enigmatic demeanor presented up front, and a tipple in the pantry to help the day along. Lord Emsworth's widowed sister Constance - brilliantly played by Jennifer Saunders (Ab Fab) - is determined to bring improvements to both the castle and her brother's life. Her severe pronouncements and scathing facial expressions are enough to scare anyone into submission. Jack Farthing as Freddie stole the show for me though. Freddie is the younger son - a charming womanizer who is always in debt, a little slow on the uptake and who runs home when his finances run low. Farthing excelled in bring Freddie to life. His delivery of Wodehouse's words was spot on and his facial expressions were comical. I quite enjoyed seeing what rakish outfit he would wear next as well.

 The physical acting is as much a part of the comedy as the words - exaggerated eye rolls, gestures, pratfalls and more. I found myself watching for Freddie to run into the same tree with the opening of each episode.

 I admit to being enthralled with British authors and British television. Blandings combined the best of both for me. This is comedy that is timeless and truly funny. Blandings reminded me so much of the innocent comedies I watched as a youngster. No laugh track (thank goodness!) but occasional background music adds to the episode. I found myself laughing out loud so many times. Blandings was a half hour of farcical fun that was the perfect way to leave the day's stresses behind.  I'll be watching for Season 2. And re-watching Season 1!",1378425600,3,2601,4.829213483146067
5777065,5,B00D7AM2WO,Thank you for this wonderful set!!!!! marvelous acting. Pure Wodehouse lots of details both subtle and blatant as yet again Wodehouse takes on and takes off on the Edwardian Upper Crust. Is there more than series one on DVD?,1378252800,4,224,4.769230769230769
8590317,5,B00D7AM2WO,"Adorable, funny TV adaptation of the Wodehouse books. If You're a Jennifer Saunders fan, You'll enjoy seeing her in a very different role from Edina on Absolutely Fabulous as the stuffy Constance..  But the true gem here is Jack Farthing as the loveable but empty headed Freddie.  Highly recommended.",1528416000,,300,5.1020408163265305
