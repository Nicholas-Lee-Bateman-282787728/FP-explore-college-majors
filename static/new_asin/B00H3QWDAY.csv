6130159,2,B00H3QWDAY,the dvd is very disappointing to me. I was expecting a lot more for a work out video. very boring.,1390435200,,98,3.95
6130160,5,B00H3QWDAY,"I received this in four days with free shipping and a tracking number!  Great service.  This DVD can be seen in packages with two or three others, but this is the one that gets you started.  There is an hour of over a dozen basic moves and a twenty minute workout.  Just enough to keep you going inbetween Zumba classes.  If you want to do it all at home, you might consider one of the other packages.",1390348800,15,401,4.1558441558441555

8629545,5,B00H3QWDAY,"Best Zumba workout ever as far as I'm concerned! So fun, plus they provide easy steps to follow in order to learn or remind you how to do the dance workouts. Some are easier to pick up than others, but don't give up! Once you do get it, you will have fun! There are several different dance styles on the DVD and I love the music!",1496448000,3,329,4.0

8629549,1,B00H3QWDAY,"If you already know basic zumba beats, then maybe this is for you. If you're a dancer of Latin music, then do not try this. These girls make a mess of their instruction. I'm a dance instructor, so know how to break down steps and these girls cannot do that. They teach too little and then ramp up the speed too quickly. If I can't follow as an experienced dancer, then I know anyone new to dance moves won't be able to either. Try something else.",1434672000,5,446,4.1976744186046515
8629550,5,B00H3QWDAY,"I enjoy the dvd's, they are instructional and offer a high level of energy.",1413158400,2,75,4.428571428571429
8629551,2,B00H3QWDAY,This seems like a watered down version of real exercise.  Wasn't impressed.,1410998400,,75,5.25
8629552,1,B00H3QWDAY,Didn't care for the music. Thought it would be good Latin music. They went to fast when demonstrating the moves. A complete waste of money.,1396569600,3,139,4.6
8629553,5,B00H3QWDAY,It was an excellent video to teach me the basic moves then give me a 20 min work out. I loved it. It was just what i needed in-between my Zumba classes without buying the entire fitness program.,1392854400,9,194,4.131578947368421
