8593482,5,B00DI5KQMQ,"This concert shows the talent of Astrud Gilberto's daughter. When I saw her in a concert in Mexico City (Teatro de la Ciudad), she stole with her beauty, her voice and her talent the breath of everybody in the theater. Now she sings in a wonderful concert surrounded of the beautiful beaches in Rio de Janeiro. This DVD should not be missing in a DVD collection of every jazz lover.",1404172800,5,382,4.4714285714285715
