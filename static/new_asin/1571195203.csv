8323667,5,1571195203,"My mother had Spook Spoofing on 8 mm film. Every year at Halloween when I was a kid and long before video tapes and video rental stores became the norm, she would pull out her old projector and movie screen (she was an elementary school teacher for 20 years) and we'd watch Spook Spoofing. It was a real treat for us and it was so much fun to pop popcorn, drink hot chocolate and watch this cute movie. It was one of the few holiday traditions my family followed. This film holds many special memories for me and I am so glad to find it available on video cassette.",996710400,,565,4.192660550458716
