Great for an avid motocross fan or action sports enthusiast! Really enjoyed it!",1372896000,,192,4.676470588235294
8220238,5,B00009KO7T,"This is the best. This DVD has 9 Motocross video's. Terrafirma 0-6, Fly, Airraid and Wrath Child. This shows Fox the motocross giant at an early trade show back in the 80's. The footage is a little bad but awesome to see what they have grown to become.
If you had to buy one video this is it. You get everything. Ricky Carmichael, James Stewart and Travis Pastrana when they are like 10 or so in Terrafirma 1. Awesome to see that also.... Highly recommed this. 2 disc set also.",1052784000,6,477,4.311111111111111
