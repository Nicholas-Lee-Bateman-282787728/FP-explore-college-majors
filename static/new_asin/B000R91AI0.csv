8199604,5,B000R91AI0,"The show is about a French explorer, Yvon Ducharme, who became frozen in an ice block in the Yukon after being knocked overboard off his boat. Luckily for Yvon, he was defrosted when he was urinated on by a sled dog owned by Tommy Tukyuk. The show follows the adventures of Yvon as he attempts to adjust to life in the Yukon with some help from his friend Tommy. It takes place in the fictional town Upyermukluk, Yukon Territory, ""the hottest cold town in the Arctic, midway between Shivermetimbers and Frostbottom Falls"".

This show aired on YTV for 4 years and I think it was a complete hoot! I'm not sure if it's Yvon's Y fronts, or his skinny legs, or that darn cute French accent, or his passion for King Louis and his native France, but he sure is one funny guy. Kids and adults alike should all check out Monsieur Ducharme.

Episode 01 - ""Call of the Mild""
Tommy feels left out when all the other boys at school proudly display signs of becoming men (armpit hair, bigger muscles, cracking voices, etc.) In an effort to make Tommy feel better, Bill concocts a phony ""Ancients Inuit Manhood Test,"" which inadvertently sends Tommy and Yvon, along with Harland and the Duke, out into a killer snowstorm.

Episode 02 - ""North of Nothing""
When a government cost-cutting measure leaves Upyermukluk off the map, Tommy and Yvon convince everyone that they must take action. And what better way for the town to become map-worthy again than to have someone set a world's record. In a madcap race for notoriety, the people of Upyermukluk succeed -- but in a most surprising way.

Episode 03 - ""License to Smell""
After three hundred years without bathing, Yvon's aroma has become unbearable even to Tommy. But getting the stubborn Frenchman to wash is next to impossible. After a series of hilarious failures, the townsfolk force Yvon to leave, until a deadly menace threatens Upyermukluk and they must seek out his ""unique"" brand of help again.

Episode 04 - ""When Love Goes Babs""
Yvon accidentally bonks Willy on the head, unleashing Babs Tidwell, Willy's mysterious alter ego ""mother."" Babs sets out to destroy Yvon, until Tommy and Luba catch wind of her deadly plot and try to stop her. A hair-raising climax reveals two things: that there's more to Babs than meets the eye, and that Yvon still has some ""issues"" with his own mother.

Episode 05 - ""An Officer & a Frenchman""
Frustrated by Luba's laissez-faire attitude toward lawbreakers, Willy hires a huge by-the-book RCMP officer, Major Sweetly, who jails everyone in Upyermukluk for the most ridiculous unfractions. Tommy signals Yvon, the last free man, to rescue them, setting the stage for a ridiculous showdown that nearly destroys the entire town.

Episode 06 - ""The Walrus Between Us""
During an ice-fishing mishap, Yvon's life is saved by ""Lumpy,"" a giant walrus, who Yvon turns into his ""pet."" This unorthodox relationship causes a rift in Yvon and Tommy's friendship and reopens an old wound in a vengeful Harland, until Yvon finally realizes that ""Lumpy,"" like all creatures, must return home.

Episode 07 - ""Beach Blanket Bozos""
Every ten years, Upyermukluk gets hot enough for the ice to melt and its citizens to flock to the beach. Coincidentally, this is the same day that Yvon plans to secretly recover a treasure chest that fell off his ship during a storm. But when the secret gets out and everyone starts looking for the treasure, Yvon blames Tommy, and the beach becomes bedlam.

Episode 08 - ""The Clod Who Would Be King""
It's Upyermukluk's annual ice festival, and who better to play ""King of the Karnival"" than Yvon? Except Yvon doesn't realize he's only ""King for a Day,"" and turns the town upside down with his oppressive royal proclamations and decrees. This sets the stage for a modern day ""french Revolution"" in which Yvon and Tommy nearly lose their heads.

Episode 09 - ""Fromage to Eternity""
Yvon brings cheese fondue to a community potluck dinner, unaware that the three hundred year old fromage has developed certain ""psychedelic"" qualities. Hilarity ensues when everyone is transformed into mild-mannered ""hippies,"" and Yvon gets an opportunity to conquer Upyermukluk once and for all.

Episode 10 - ""Million Dollar Moron""
Yvon's troubles are over when he wins the Publisher's ClearingHouse Sweepstakes. Or are they? Yvon's king-sized spending habits create chaos for everyone in Upyermukluk, and are made worse when a second ""Yvonne Ducharme"" shows up to collect her rightful winnings.

Episode 11 - ""Mad Dog Ducharme""
When Yvon accepts a TV wrestling challenge from a phony WWF type champion, the ground is set for the ""Rumble in Upyermukluk."" But Yvon thinks the fight is supposed to be real and refuses to take a dive. This forces TV promoters to bring in a real fighter, Ivan the Terrible, the most vicious wrestler that ever lived.

Episode 12 - ""Love on the Rocks""
After watching an old Hollywood movie, Yvon sends a letter to its romantic star, Miss Lillian Valentine. Days later, to everyone's surprise, an 80 year old Lillian shows up in Upyermukluk. But her age doesn't bother Yvon. He falls madly in love with her anyway, and then pops the question. But after a few nights in the freezing cold Yukon, the real question becomes: is Lillian still alive?

Episode 13 - ""An Affair to Dismember""
In a desperate bid to bring the world famous Bingopalooza Games to Upyermukluk, Big Mary puts on a fancy banquet. And who better to accompany her than suave and witty Yvon? But it isn't long before Yvon's antics ruin the banquet, Harland becomes jealous, and Upyermukluk witnesses its own version of ""High Noon,"" which ultimately teaches Big Mary the depth of Harland's love for her.
