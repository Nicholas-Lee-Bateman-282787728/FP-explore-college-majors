7905042,5,B000007NTX,"If I had to make a brief account of the top five films of Carlos Saura, this film must be included in this list without any shadow of doubt.

Since an architect suffers an awful accident who lets him in a wheel chair and incapable to pronounce just a simple word , he will be the silent  witness of the horror and nastiness of his family members who are really -with visible anxiety- he dies to enrich themselves.

It is very important for you , my dear reader to realize the underground clues given by Saura in this age of the Franquist Regime where the metaphors should be intelligently suggested to avoid the implaccable censure in those times.

Watch as soon as you can this superb and powerful movie!",1107129600,,705,4.441860465116279
7905043,5,B000007NTX,"Pauline Kael called this film a comedy. I think it is more of a magical realism melodrama, intercepted with typical sarcastic Spanish humor.
""The Garden of Delights"" is a story about impotence  [both symbolic and literal] of contemporary society, with all its money and  technological advancement.  The main character is a man in a wheelchair,  who does not have an actual medical illness; he is paralyzed by the  uselessness of his own existence, and so is his whole household.
Saura's camera works to create the aura of emptiness, uselessness, and  mental confusion-- qualities that can characterize every single member of  the household, with the exception of the non-real, airy aunt from another  world.  He constantly uses annoyingly long shots, empty shots, purposeless  shots, etc.
If, in fact, main characters do have an illness, then, it is  definitely paranoia, which creates a seeming physical ailment.
This film  is deep, artistically and emotionally challenging. It demands more than a  simple casual viewing.",960422400,4,1022,5.3125
