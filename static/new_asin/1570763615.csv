7797213,5,1570763615,"I am a very detail-oriented, thinking rider. I want to know which part is doing what and why. And this video is packed with that exact information. It gives you plenty to think about and visualize yourself doing correctly before you get on a horse. Once you get on, you have already thought about everything you need to do and that makes it easier for the body to respond in the appropriate time and manner. On the other hand, for those individuals who have a more natural feel for riding already, this video might not be as helpful.",1427760000,,533,4.448979591836735
7797214,1,1570763615,The cd was badly damaged.  I had friends over to watch it and we couldn't even understand what was being said.,1405814400,,110,4.238095238095238
7797215,5,1570763615,Actually think watching these videos have been beneficial and my trainer has noticed a change too - without me telling him about watching these two videos!,1390694400,,155,5.0
7797216,5,1570763615,It was highly recommended by my riding instructor and it did not disappoint. My riding has improved due to frequent reviews of the recorded lessons,1383004800,,147,4.92
7797217,5,1570763615,I have been having real confidence issues at the canter - so I watched the first video- I think it's even starting to work!,1382918400,,123,4.166666666666667
7797218,5,1570763615,"I highly recommend this DVD, especially to those that are learning the aids of leg yields, counter canter, lengthening, 10m circles, and 15m circles. Each aid is provided not only has a list (that you can screen shot to save as notes) but Jane repeats the aids while the movement is performed and uses a still-shot of the movement with arrows and words to really emphasize the aids. I am a very visual and technical person, I want to know what I am doing with my entire body and this DVD met both my learning styles. While I've been riding for years, I've learned new things to help perfect both my downward and upward transitions! I've learned more with this one hour DVD that I could possibly in a month's worth of weekly lessons!!! I cannot stress how highly I think of this DVD and of Jane. Everything is explained in such great detail but it isn't overloading either that beginners would still benefit from it as well. I am so impressed with the DVD, I signed up for her monthly online website and plan on purchasing many more of her DVDs and books. I can see why everyone has praised Jane so much! This is not a DVD you will regret.",1371513600,5,1138,4.372641509433962
7797219,5,1570763615,"Jane Savoie has a practical way of speaking to dressage riders in a manner that is easily understood.  I believe this video will give great help in visualizing how you want to look in the saddle that will help especially those who compete
in recognized shows.",1359849600,,259,4.630434782608695
7797220,5,1570763615,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who rides Dressage with her horse. I had gotten her the first DVD last summer and it is a great video also. There's something about watching correct riding that really does help with your own visualization. You don't anticipate the usual problems. Her instructor watched the first one and liked it also. This one is more advanced and will be helpful for many years. The first DVD is a great reminder of the basics which is what seasoned riders tend to forget to practice. :),1358640000,,516,4.5
7797221,4,1570763615,"This video has been really helpful to me. The riders and horses are of very good quality, with the riders demonstrating independent seats and textbook position. It is not a ""how to teach your horse to do this"" video. It is incredibly effective, though, in its true intent: a demonstration of how the movements in the tests should look and a guide to help the rider ride them effectively. I wish all of the training level movements were on the 1st video, but you have to get the 2nd video (this one) for the stretch down circle and the loop from training 4. As an amateur trying to head for rated dressage, I watch this video frequently prior to my ride. It's like having my instructor here all the time. Incredibly useful for those who keep horses at home and not in a full-time professional setting. My only request: make them longer and separate the movements into ""tracks"" so you could skip to what you were working on that day (like a scene selection). That would be quite handy!",1170720000,,983,4.4972067039106145
