509474,5,6302747252,"Broadway Rhythm from the Warner Brothers Archive Collection is a classic example of the best of the lost art of MGM musicals. The story line is secondary to introducing some exciting musical numbers and showcase a wide variety of talent and novelty acts. In addition to the more famous talents of Ginny Simms and Tommy Dorsey, we get to see Lena Horne sing a Brazillian Boogie, Hazel Scott plays the piano with lightning-speed fingers, Ben Ross, Nancy Walker and Eddie Anderson (Jack Benny's Rochester) add their comic style to the supporting cast, and the amazing Ross Sisters literally bend over backwards to entertain with their wonderful mix of harmonizing to a contortionist dance routine. I was delighted to find this available on DVD. Definitely worth a look!",1261872000,5,766,5.039370078740157
509475,5,6302747252,"Great underrated Musical from the 'Golden Era'.
Tommy Dorsey and Ginny Sims are allways great and Nancy Walker is a hoot.
The VHS tape is OK but it should have been on Laserdisc.
The DVD is over due.
Hurry Up Warners!!",1147132800,4,218,4.341463414634147
509476,5,6302747252,Come on studios don't you notice people stopped commenting on this movie in 2003. That means others like me are waiting fot the Re-mastered Dolby Digital DVD version to be released before we buy.,1146787200,4,195,4.764705882352941
509477,4,6302747252,"Watch for Nancy Walker's MILKMAN, KEEP THOSE BOTTLES QUIET, a number which hardly gets any attention when MGM musical retrospectives are done, but is one of the finest performances in any MGM musical.

509507,4,6302747252,"Even though my favorite part is the Ross Sisters act, I found the movies quite entertaining. Basically, it's a series of Cameos of MGM stars from the time with a back story that kind of ties it together, but the Cameos are worth the purchase price.",1402012800,,248,4.413043478260869

509511,2,6302747252,"This is a very long and severely flawed musical that appeared during the Second World War.  There are a couple of highlights: Ginny Simms singing Jerome Kern, and the incredible Ross Sisters (who have an act that is almost worth the price of this film).  Beyond that, it's a tedium of ""filler"" acts and excruciatingly corny dialogue.  Charles Winniger plays his usual, super-loud role.  (Actors shout throughout the production, the director seemingly unaware that he is not in a theater.) Why were Lena Horne (given two lousy songs)and Rochester even in the film?  Why were totally unamusing Ben Blue and Nancy Walker included? Who was the impersonator, and why was was his crummy act in the film? And then there's George Murphy, at 42 a disaster as a young theater owner and hoofer.  Not to mention Tommy Dorsey, who plays little and tries to smile a lot. Or 20-year-old Gloria DeHaven, at the beginning of an wholly undistinguished career in movies.

In short, this film is largely a disaster.  What could MGM executives have been thinking in 1944?  Did someone ask them to do a two hour movie to entertain troops overseas?  In any case, Broadway Rhythm is a blight on the record of Hollywood's best studio.",1333497600,,1209,4.797101449275362

509513,3,6302747252,"BROADWAY RHYTHM is a lengthy musical drama (114 minutes -- nearly 2 hours).  Nearly all of the scenes takes place inside, though there are a couple of out-of-doors scenes on a college campus.  The movie, which contains light comedy, some gentle slapstick, and banter regarding theater productions, is basically a forum for an on-going talent show.  Highlights of the ""talent show"" are two pieces featuring Lena Horne.  One of Lena Horne's scenes is a tawdry faux Brazilian tap-dance piece, while the other, which shows much more class, is a jazzy lounge act. Lena Horne, of course, is one of the most successful performers in the history of vinyl.

Another highlight is a 10-minute piece by the Ross Sisters.  These three women are real sisters, who sing and do a gymnastics/contortionist act.  In fact, the reason I bought this disc was to see this piece by the Ross Sisters.  Towards the end of BROADWAY RHYTHM there is a splended tap dance piece -- a male solo act.  The tap dance piece is straight tap-dancing, with no gimmicks or distractions, and it could serve (in my opinion) as a good teaching device for advanced tap students.  Another fine act is a female African-American pianist, who combines a classical piece with nimble-fingered ragtime.

In one of the acts, all of the performers in the orchestra (playing violins and brass) are dressed in clown suits.  In another one of the acts, all of the performers in the orchestra, as well as a group of tap dancers, are dressed in identical milkman suits.  I liked the clown suits, and I liked the milkman suits.

Ginny Simms (born 1915) is the star of BROADWAY RHYTHM.  She appeared in eleven movies from 1939 to 1951, and performed with the famed Kay Kyser Orchestra as a singer.  But I found Ms. Simms to be somewhat bland as an actress.

Gloria DeHaven (born 1925) stole the show, in my opinion.  She is abundantly lovely, and plays a character who is an 18 year old high school student bent on a theatrical career, instead of college.  She also has a fine singing number, where she arrives on a motorized cart that bears a circus organ.

Nancy Walker (born 1922), is the odd one here.  She is a frumpy little woman, not at all pretty, who has spunk and an excellent singing voice.  Ms. Walker had a long career on television, appearing on the Gary Moore Show, Carol Burnett Show, Family Affair, and Mary Tyler Moore Show.

CONCLUSION.  The lite-humor in BROADWAY RHYTHM is often engaging.  But the script and plot cannot be characterized as particularly clever, and there is too much talking.  Moreover, there are no drop-dead lavish, spectacular stage scenes in BROADWAY RHYTHM.  For viewers interested in musicals from the big band era, films with higher priority than BROADWAY RHYTHM might include SINGING IN THE RAIN, ON THE TOWN, THREE LITTLE WORDS, and the films from the Mickey Rooney & Judy Garland collection.",1293408000,10,2881,4.779352226720648
509514,4,6302747252,"One word: Amazing.

Those talents in this Revue-Show-movie are incredible: Tommy Dorsey, Nancy Walker, George Murphy, Lena Horne and those very special ""The Ross Sisters""-Number.

Sadly Warner Bros. has not remastered and restored this movie for the DVD release but its still in very good condition.",1275782400,,299,5.478260869565218
509515,5,6302747252,"Though not in the same category as MGM classics such as Singin' in the Rain, The Wizard of Oz and so many others, Broadway Rhythm (1944) is a very fun, extremely well-made movie with strong production values.
This was MGM's attempt to turn Ginny Simms (one of LB Mayer's favorite singers) into a major box-office star. While possessing a gorgeous voice, the looks (check out her entrance in the nightclub scene to the accompaniment of Tommy Dorsey's Irrisistable You) and a pleasing personality she just didn't click in a large way with the moviegoing public which is a shame because she is very good in this movie.
Broadway Rhythm is a much altered version of the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II 1939 Broadway musical Very Warm For May. Only the standard All the Things You Are, sung beautifully by Ginny Simms and a medley of songs from the score sung by George Murphy were retained from the original production. Other musical standouts include Ginny Simm's Amor, Lena Horne's Brazilian Boogie and Somebody Loves Me, Nancy Walker and Tommy Dorsey's Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet, Gloria DeHaven and Kenny Bowers' What Do You Think I Am and the incredible Ross Sisters doing their acrobatics and contortions to Solid Potato Salad and Manhattan Serenade.
The plot is nil, but who cares since this is a musical and the musical numbers are what counts. There are many of them and they are spaced nicely (and often) to relieve the tedium of the standard showbiz storyline. Other standout performers include Charles Winninger as George Murphy's father and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson. The color cinematography is beautiful and the print released here with no restoration apparently is in excellent shape.
Broadway Rhythm is a great example of fantasy and escapism produced during the World War II years. Highly recommended for those who enjoy MGM musicals from their heyday and great music and dancing from a large talented cast.",1263254400,17,1929,5.012461059190031

7830852,3,6302747252,"I WILL say it's a slightly interesting film, but certainly one of the lower in the canon of MGM musicals. It really contains no major stars and has a contrived plot, but it DOES contain two great musical moments.

1. The Betty Walker ""Milkman"" number, and...
2. The absolutely bizarre ""Solid Potato Salad"" number performed by the trio of The Ross Sisters, who (as the number goes on), are revealed to all be contortionists. They perform dance moves that nobody should be able to do without dying.

In conclusion, it's not great, but it has it's moments.",1493078400,,553,4.690721649484536
