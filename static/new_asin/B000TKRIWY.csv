8342568,1,B000TKRIWY,"This dvd is horrible.  Maybe if you're 8 you would like it, granted i understand it is a dvd on magic tricks, but most of the tricks anybody with the least bit of common sense can figure them out.  I really didn't need to watch the how to part to figure most of them out.  I post this as a warning to anybody who is looking for a cool trick to show your friends when you're hanging around.  IF you're 8 go for it.",1199664000,,413,3.880952380952381

8342571,5,B000TKRIWY,"Love this DVD I got recently.  It's easy to learn via clear, simple instruction and everyday objects to perform magic. You will probably not get a VEGAS gig by watching this; however, it sure is a good way pick up a few things to impress your friends, business associates, and your date.",1189728000,4,287,4.519230769230769
8342572,4,B000TKRIWY,"I once saw Curtis perform at our office function.  Lot of us wondered how he did what he performed. This is really cool that I can get to see the tricks myself.

I definitely recommend.",1186531200,4,185,4.257142857142857
