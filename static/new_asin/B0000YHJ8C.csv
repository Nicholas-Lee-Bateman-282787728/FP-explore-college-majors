Along the way, he makes new friends, including an ABCD girlfriend who show him how to live a new life from both perspectives one of the already settled first generation person and that of the newly arrived emigres.  If you're looking for a hilarious romcom, this isn't it nor is it an OTT drama.  It's an indie film with moments of realism and honesty from the pov of the main character.  Some of it is hard to get through, but some of the moments were funny and lighthearted.",1383868800,,545,4.211538461538462
