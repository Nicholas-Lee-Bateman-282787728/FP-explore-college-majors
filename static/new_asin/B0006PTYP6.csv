2190651,5,B0006PTYP6,"UCOS - The Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad is a rag tag, elder bunch of ex-cops who are assembled by the recently demoted DS Pullman, played by Amanda Redman.  She had a bust go bad where she accidentally shot a dog, and suddenly she finds herself leading this team of cops whose best years are far behind them.  All of her 3 re-hires left the police for various reasons and each has their own share of personal and emotional issues they are dealing with.  For Pullman, she is constantly trying to balance her career and finding the time to continually hit the dating scene in her 40's.  Handling the stubborn and erratic personalities of her new team is another challenge.

Jack Halford (played by James Bolam) is the only member who left the police force on amicable terms, having retired as a D.C. Superintendent.  He is forever haunted by the hit and run accident that claimed his wife.  He seems to be the oldest, but also the clearest thinker of the squad.

Brian Lane (played by Alun Armstrong) is an ex Detective Inspector who was sacked for having someone die while in his custody, which he strongly felt was not his fault.  He's sort of a pill popping, memory machine with OCD who memorized everyone's resume who has ever worked at Scotland Yard.  Also, if you ask him what he was doing on July 19th, 1978, he'll remember.

My favorite of the bunch, and what drew me to find this show in the first place is the star of numerous popular UK shows over the years, including the highly popular Sweeney and Minder series, Dennis Waterman.  It seems he always plays a ladies' man in every series, and this one is no exception.  You will usually find him hitting on his boss, being pursued by ex-flames, or eyeing the multitude of women he encounters during his cases.

Waterman's character Gerry Standing, although no longer performing his legendary fisticuffs as he did in Minder and Sweeney, still manages to pull some punches with his sharp tongue and wit.  He was fired for breaking his superior's jaw, a Commisioner Bevan, who just so happens to be UCOS's supervisor, so you can imagine the interaction just waiting to happen there.  A classic Waterman highlight is when the crew is reviewing film of a late 60's protest for a case and he jumps up, all serious-like and says, ""ey, wait"".  Then pauses the video only to point at a girl in the crowd and say, ""I had her"".

After a rather long 90 minute pilot, once you get into normal episodes, they are strong from start to finish.  Unlike US TV shows, where going back and viewing the first 5 or 6 shows can sometimes look awkward; and actors don't really find their niche in their character, sometimes up until the 2nd season; this superb gang of British vets really nail their characters right out of the gate.  I felt the pilot was merely a preview of what was to come, and it certainly doesn't play like the rest of the episodes do in the series (they are much better).  I was almost ready to write the series off after the pilot, but I'm glad I didn't.

One other fine character is PC Clark, played by Chike Okonkwo.  In this first series, he is the low on the totem pole, young police constable, who really offsets all the older characters.  He was always eager to help out and offer his young viewpoint and detective skills to the team.  I feel this will be a slight negative not seeing him reappear in later shows, as his character does not return for series 2.  A minor setback to an otherwise strong and entertaining British show.

While following that TV crime solving mold, it still manages to have that certain appeal that US shows simply do not have.  It's also great to see one of my favorite actors, Dennis Waterman, still holding his own after 4 decades.  He also sings the show's theme song (a staple for shows he's starred in over the years) and a cover of the Traveling Wilbury's End Of The Line in one of the episodes.

It's surprising to see this as a US DVD release, because as far as I know, this only appeared on some PBS channels in certain parts of the country, and I haven't seen it on any cable channels (maybe BBC America at one time?).  I think it's high ratings in it's later seasons in the UK have warranted a US ""trial"".  I say trial as in they release a first season, and only subsequent sets come out if sales are good.  However, even The Sweeney hasn't had a series 2 release in the US yet, so I presume there's a slim chance of all 5 later series of New Tricks getting released here, but you never know.  I'll just have to continue ordering the Region 2 series sets.  Series 6 aired in July in the UK with a DVD release scheduled for Sept. '09.",1251331200,58,4644,4.436320754716981
2190652,5,B0006PTYP6,"I was pleased when PBS started airing this british detective series. Retired police detectives are hired by the police department to solve COLD CASES.

But the real fun is in watching this motley crew work. Like Columbo, they are real geniuses full of quirks, old & seasoned but with more energy than most half their age.

If you like quirky detective drama with a few laughs thrown in, then htis is the series for you.

Yes, that is Dennis Waterman from the old 1970's British cop series ""The Sweeney"".

2190653,5,B0006PTYP6,"What a wonderful contrast to the emaciated girlies and Hollywood pretty boys that typically inhabit the leading roles in American crimes series. I love everything about this British series: the realistic, lovable characters, the humor, great storytelling, and the absence of excessive violence, blood baths, and rotting corpses that are so prevalent in American crime series these days. I ordered season 1 to 4 from Amazon UK. I had to ""internationalize"" my DVD player, though: videohelp.com/dvdhacks will tell you how to make your player region-free.",1247702400,85,551,5.4941176470588236
2190654,5,B0006PTYP6,"New Tricks is the best British cop show since the legendry 'Sweeney'. Like that great show what New Tricks has, but most British Cop shows lack is humour. This is not to say that is it is either a comedy or a 'light' detective series in the manner of say Pie in the Sky. The crimes in New Tricks are real, violent often messy.

The concept is not new, three retired detectives are called back to look at unsolved cases. The premise being that as old coppers they will be aware of the police procedures at the time when the crimes were carried out. The first Jack Halford (James Bolam)was the most senior and the most level headed even though he spends most evenings talking to his dead wife who is buried in his back garden. Jack has a violent and brutal side which from time to time slips out. He does however appear to have the respect of everyone who knew him as a serving police officer.

The second is Gerry Standing ( Dennis Waterman). We get the impression that Jerry was not above taking the odd bribe from criminals but as he tells his boss 'Sandra I'm a bad boy not a bastard'. He has a number of ex wives and host of children all of whom are girls. Collectively he calls them 'The Covern.' Of the three he is the one who refuses to grow old. An early scene has the three compairing medication. The other two have pills for blood pressure, heart, depression etc. Gerry has viagra. He also struggles with the modern no smoking rules.

The third, Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong). Brain suffers from mental health problems and is a recovering alcoholic. He also has an encyclopedic knowledge of criminal cases and various police officers hence his knickname og 'Memory Lane'. Alone of the three he has a wife (Susan Jameson) who struggles to cope with his bizzare behavour.

The three are managed by Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redmond)who is the only serving police officer in the team. She is torn between defending her team from those higher up and frustration at the old school antics of the three, such as secretly taping suspects, this is defended by Gerry who points out he is no longer a copper and only the police are bared from secretly tapping suspects.

Each of the five is perfectly played. Class drama, well written undemanding but does not treat you as an idiot.",1246838400,127,2275,4.512135922330097

2190664,5,B0006PTYP6,"We ""binge-watched"" all 12 seasons of NEW TRICKS over several weeks, and thoroughly enjoyed every episode! Covering a plethora of, sometimes novel, murder mysteries, including possible witchcraft, a brewery drowning, and an episode about the world's biggest carp! Of course, as w/ most British cop shows, the cast has perfect chemistry. In order to solve cold cases, a team of retired officers is assembled, consisting of the wise, rather morose -he never got over his wife's death- Jack Halford (James Bolam), the alcoholic, OCD-suffering, total recall-blessed Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong), and the rather randy, fun-loving Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman). In charge of this merry band of coconuts is DS Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redman), who landed the job after a disaster altered her career path. Every episode is packed w/ semi-suspense, comradery, and a heavy dose of good-natured humor. The original cast remains intact until season 8, when Jack departs. In season 10, Brian bails, while Gerry lasts until season 11. By the final season, no one is left from the original lineup. Still, the replacements, Steve McAndrew (Denis ""Wedge"" Lawson), Danny Griffin (Nicholas ""Rodney Trotter"" Lyndhurst), and DCI Sasha Miller (Tamzin Outhwaite) are quite good. The twelfth season did seem a bit rushed, and ended too abruptly. In spite of this, NEW TRICKS is addictive from start to finish. Highly recommended...",1490054400,,1406,5.366515837104072

2190671,5,B0006PTYP6,"Being from the USA, I got tired of video corporations' whims on dragging their feet deciding which British TV shows to allow streaming of in the US, or air on PBS stations. At best, which Brit shows air in the US is spotty. I finally said, screw it. I bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-BDP-S6500-Multi-Region-Blu-ray-DVD-Region-Free-Player/dp/B01E4NDS48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony BDP-S6500 Multi-Region Blu-ray DVD Region Free Player</a>&nbsp;(4K-Wifi-3D-Smart Region Free) which is a dream. This New Trick DVD Complete DVD set plays beautifully on this machine.

The machine knows what region the DVD is from without having to switch any switches -- in other words, effortless. Now I can watch DVDs and Blu-Rays from all over the world (all regions). Even though not Blu-Ray, this New Tricks set of DVDs plays sharp and clean, to my untrained eye is equivalent to HD quality.

When buying Multi-Region, be sure the description says so! You can have the same exact Model # without it being Multi-Region -- go figure. ***** If it explicitly doesn't say it is Multi-Region, IT IS NOT! ***** Move on and find a model/seller whose description says it does have Multi-Region. For example, the same model sold by BestBuy was NOT Multi-Region -- therefore, I refused to purchase it.

I got New Tricks from ** WorldImport.** I recommend them. It took roughly three weeks to ship from Switzerland to California, but arrived in perfect shape. I was fine with waiting. I am as happy as a clam.

Oh, by the way, just so you know, it appear that video corporations ONLY offer roughly half of the episodes actually produced (aka ""getting rooked""). In buying Blu-Ray/DVD sets, you get ALL the shows produced.",1477440000,2,1754,5.32129963898917

Blending ""cold case"" detective work, humor, and unforgettable characters, NT has joined my top ten list. If you're wanting something different, and you crave crime dramas mixed w/ human interest, then here you go! Amanda Redman is perfect as D.S. Sandra Pullman, the head of the newly formed Unsolved Crimes Unit (aka: USOC). The catch is, she's got to put together a team of retired officers, and the pickings are rather slim. The three members chosen, are best described as..., er, ""past it"". Or are they? Each man -Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman), Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong), and Jack Halford (James Bolam)- brings unique abilities to the squad, in spite of other, less desirable qualities. Together, these misfits must solve old crimes, while also battling their own personal demons, and a prat-of-a boss, Donald Bevan (Nicholas Day).

After eliminating the drunks, the racists, the sexists, and those who have heart attacks upon being offered the job, she is left with a trio of detectives of the old school whose methods are not exactly approved by modern courts, and who are all battling their own particular demons from their days on the force.  Nonetheless, they generally succeed, although with the unheralded and generally unrecognized assistance of a junior black constable assigned to do a lot of the administrative work.
Played with a straight face, but with scripts which go as much for humor as for the mystery.  This show has been going on for quite a while.  Most of the first season cases seem to derive from the late 70s and early 80s, but at the time of filming they would only have been about 20-25 years old.",1455408000,,1251,4.633484162895928

The concept is not especially new - ""The Over-the-Hill Gang"" was, after all, done about 40 years ago in the U.S. - but the execution of this cop show is especially well done because it is (a) brilliantly written, (b) extremely well acted and (c) because the characters are so very, very human. The top cop is Sandra Pullman, who has dedicated her life to her career at the expense of any true relationships. She falls in love with the wrong men and sometimes she drinks too much. One of her detectives has a slightly tarnished past and is a serial womanizer, another talks to his dead wife over a glass of scotch in his garden and the third is a recovering alcoholic who is certain that he is the victim of multiple conspiracies.
  They do not all get on well at first - in fact there are some classic scenes that show you exactly how badly they get on - but despite their differences and their quirks they do solve crimes that have been filed away as, well, unsolvable by other cops.
  This first series - including the pilot episode - sets the stage for many brilliant seasons that followed.

I have just bought and watched Season 1, as a fan of the show from PBS. This season tells how it all began:  how the team was assembled and gives you some insight into each member's personality.  It combines drama and comedy, stirring it up nicely into an entertaining mixture.
If I'm not spoiling things, I was disappointed with Episode 6.  But, I guess nobody's perfect, heh?
I plan to buy the other seasons, too, collecting all of them.

The sparks that this unlikely quartet throws off are dazzling. And the plots are terrific, too. If you've never seen it, do so now.

This is one series that I came to love during the course of viewing it. The premise is priceless and the stories are great. Female Superintendent (You go, girl!) leads the Unsolved Crimes unit made up of three retired male detectives from before her time. The first episode started out with a bang, then slowed a bit and then moved into action. Her downfall began with shooting a dog that attacked her during the raid of a cockerel fight and is the running gag during the series.
Overall, I've come to love this show. It's great fun and interesting crime drama as well. The four different characters have a great rapport. I highly recommend it if you're a fan of British TV. Overall, well done.",1377820800,,848,4.47741935483871

I think it is going to be great watching the team grow together since I had not seen any of these early episodes before.  Seriously enjoyed the story lines.

Since Season One, I've kept up with the series and it simply just keeps getting better and better.  The character development (certainly some ""interesting"" goings-on in and with this team, headed by Sandra, who's nobody's fool!).

2190746,5,B0006PTYP6,"New tricks is an excellent television series from the United Kingdom. This series mixes a variety of elements including comedy, drama, and police procedural which make it a very enjoyable series to watch. New tricks season one contains six episodes and the pilot. New tricks follows the exploits of the newly formed unsolved crimes unit. The unit is comprised of three retired inspectors and their supervisor, disgraced detective superintendent Sandra Pullman, played to perfection by Amanda Redman. The three detectives comprising the squad are eccentric to say the least. They are not used to modern policing techniques, like DNA and other advances in technology. The each have bizarre personality characteristics. For example Brian Lane is obsessive compulsive, while grieving widower Jack Halford consults his wife's grave for advice on investigations. Dennis Waterman plays ex- Sgt. Gerry Standing, a cocky womanizer with three ex-wives and a daughter by each. Some trivia regarding the show, Waterman seems the theme song. This fantastic series debuted in 2003, and the ninth season has just begun in 2012. This is a very enjoyable series that is highly recommended. I rate it five stars.

The cast of unique characters each with their own idiosyncracies makes this not only an extremely humorous series but holds up quite well amongst the best dectective series ever produced. One would think that as this series progressed the interaction between the detectives would be predictable but that is not the case at all.

With New Tricks you must get past the pilot, and probably the first two episodes to see the characters emerge.  The writing is superb, subtle, biting at times, and always on spot.  The actors' delivery is never contrived, but rather natural and definitely in keeping with the character... this is why you must let the characters imprint you on the first couple episodes.

So these stories start out seemingly to fill you but when you get to the end, it just deflates like an empty Twinkie balloon. The writers do not know how to create a drama with a memorable, rather than forgettable finish. Each episode had a predictable, bland uncreative closure to it's plot.

Two stars only because the acting and character portrayal, even though unrealistically off-the-wall, ends up holding the stories together. In particular, the dialogue portion of the script was typical British sarcastically spot on.

After only a few hours, I think of this band of retired British police officers (led by the smart and sexy - and sometimes paranoid - female detective as my friends. The actors are superb.

2190771,5,B0006PTYP6,"This is a great series, but don't be snookered into paying the outrageous prices demanded by these amazon pirates for used copies.

BBC America indicates on their website that Season One will be available again after 5 Dec 2010, for about $38.

Buyer beware!",1290988800,,258,4.840909090909091
2190772,5,B0006PTYP6,"I saw the show by accident and fell in love with it; well acted, well written, television at it's best.",1290211200,,103,4.2
2190773,4,B0006PTYP6,If you are 51 and older you are going to find this very encourging and fun to watch. Younger people will get a kick out of this and get to see what can and is done by older folks.,1284163200,,179,3.6153846153846154
2190774,5,B0006PTYP6,We missed the first two season on PBS so this was a great way to catch up.,1284076800,,74,3.411764705882353
2190775,5,B0006PTYP6,"The premise is terrific: a cold case team consisting of a sitting Detective Superintendent and three former coppers, one a recent widower, one a much-married jokester, the third an obsessive-compulsive.  The initial credits and theme music suggest that we're in for a lighthearted laugh fest.  We're not.  There is humor, much of it sweet and clever, but this is noir drama of a very high order.  The scripts are tight, the acting superb, the characters endearing.  I love British mysteries, with Foyle at the top of my pantheon, followed closely by Frost, Morse, Lewis, Midsomer Murders, et al.  Move over guys and make room for the team from New Tricks.  This is the real deal--first-rate crime drama as only the Brits can do it (consistently).",1283299200,2,746,4.92
2190776,5,B0006PTYP6,This series combines excellent plots with good humor and interplay among the principal characters.  I highly recommend it.,1282780800,,122,5.777777777777778
2190777,4,B0006PTYP6,"I watch a lot of British serials, and recently discovered New Tricks. While not in the category of, say, Foyles War, this is a well-acted and written series. The theme song is absolutely awful, but once you're past that you can find dependable entertainment. The series is smart and funny, and the stories are interesting. I find myself caring about the characters and wanting to know more about them. That's how I know I'm hooked on a series. Do't make your judgement based on just one show -- watch a few and you'll find the series growing on you.",1282435200,,549,4.555555555555555
2190778,5,B0006PTYP6,"If one hungers for the brillance of good entertainment represented by wonderful acting, great writing, and meticulous directing, then it is ""New Tricks"" for you!  This series is full of true life situations, and spontaneous, situational humor.  Although not a comedy, every intense and suspenseful episode gives the viewer enough humor to make the story and the characters ""real"".  The whole thing is just wonderful and I cannot recommend it too highly to the ""crime & punishment"" and ""British mystery"" fan, alike.  I believe you'll love it.",1282176000,,541,5.183908045977011
2190779,5,B0006PTYP6,"One of the best British mystery shows ever. No blood and guts but a mystery mixed together with humor and characters that are real world people rather than the ""pretty boy"" images on American tv. The characters are warm, lovable, funny and totally interesting. They are a bunch of retired ""old geezers"", who were once police officers, and come together with a new department set up to solve cold cases for the police dept. GREAT STUFF!!",1278028800,,436,4.75
2190780,5,B0006PTYP6,"I stumbled onto this show on PBS and have been addicted ever since.  It's serious, funny, entertaining and charming.  It always has a good British 'who-done-it'.  I'm just sad that there are only 4 seasons available.",1277510400,,216,4.944444444444445
2190781,5,B0006PTYP6,"This is crime-solving at its best - serious cold crime cases, solved by 3 detectives who each have their own strengths and hilarious idiosyncracies. They're like buddies who are astute in their professional roles but still give each other a hard time, and enjoy a good laugh with their viewers. Law & Order can be sooo drawn out and somewhat predictable. This show is much more sophisticated; viewers understand and feel outraged at horrendous crimes, yet we're entertained with the detectives' antics and schemes, and we're not bored because no two crimes are solved the same way. I highly recommend this show (DVD for Season 6 already released in the UK so more will follow in the US) and all future seasons. The quality of the actors and the amusing, intelligent writing are superb - offering us a truly entertaining and absorbing crime dramedy here in the US.",1277078400,,863,4.837837837837838
2190782,5,B0006PTYP6,"What happens when a police officer generates the wrong type of headlines?  You move her to head a new unit that reviews unsolved cases.  To assist her, hire some WYSIWYG retired detectives.  Her knowledge of present PC procedures and their understanding of past practices form the basis for interesting hour long episodes. One man's trash is another man's treasure, and New Tricks strikes the mother lode.",1273449600,,405,5.106060606060606
2190783,5,B0006PTYP6,"This show is just so much fun.  It is well plotted, well acted, and just so enjoyable on so many levels.  If you are a fan of Brit TV at all, don't miss this one.  I have the second season, and can't wait for the third and fourth to become available.",1272326400,,250,3.8627450980392157
2190784,5,B0006PTYP6,"Just look at how high the ratings are for this show here at Amazon! That really says it all. I discovered this show through a local library and was very happily surprised. I enjoy police shows and I enjoy comedies but I never imagined that any show could blend them so well. The actors are so very good too. The last couple of epsiodes at the end of Series One started getting a little too heavy in subject matter. The comey of the very funny first shows of Season One isn't sustained and seems to have been tempered down a little by the end of the season, but I still think it's a great program.",1271980800,,596,4.191304347826087
2190785,5,B0006PTYP6,"This show is just awesome, right down to the great cast members, to the cool
theme song, and well written episodes.  Few cop dramas have real humor in them without being some kind of parody. This is not that at all, it is true to life and lets face it there's humor in real life too. Especially when it's older retired cops who are driven to solve crimes and have to face todays world of policing.  I honestly laughed more than once during this show and never felt it wasn't a situation that didn't seem reasonable.  As far as cop shows go this one is right up there in the top for me.  It's not a action show but a drama and murder mystery show done with heart.  It's always interesting  to see older generations work with younger ones and in police work that's going to be even more interesting.  So get yourself a new trick and get into this series.  The dvd set utilizes very good prints and the episodes look pristine as they should.  You get all ten first season episodes here for many good minutes of entertainment and fun. Wether you are young or old in you like cop dramas with humor and no violence on screen then you will enjoy this show.",1271462400,,1149,4.282407407407407
2190786,4,B0006PTYP6,"I was looking through amazon and found this series by accident. Loved it and have several seasons. Funny and thought provoking. The rememberances of the old guys are really for those who lived in England and were up on current affairs in the 80's, although you can pretty well follow along if you are an Americna like me. A decent series, that we have enjoyed and look forward tot he next seasons.",1271030400,,397,4.527777777777778
2190787,5,B0006PTYP6,"I want to amend my previous poor rating of this series. We have finally worked out how the subtitles work (The BBC could have made it simpler). It has become one of our favourites together with Doc Martin.  So This is a Five Star now.
Thanks",1269475200,4,241,4.239130434782608
2190788,5,B0006PTYP6,Extremely well written mystery series.  Focuses on changes in social more's since the 1970's.  Good mystery and good comedy.  A five star performance.,1267142400,,150,5.434782608695652
2190789,5,B0006PTYP6,"This is FANTASTIC!!!  These are older, retired fellas, ex-coppers, bought out of retirement to solve 'cold case' crimes.  Their boss can be a cranky bitch - but they are individually 'off-track', but form a solid team to solve interesting cases.",1265587200,,245,5.1
2190790,5,B0006PTYP6,"I am a huge fan of this show.  I love shows that are character driven.  This show's characters are so well defined that the stories just flow naturally.  The acting and writing are superb.  I am especially tickled when the characters use a British-ism that I've never heard! The plots stories are nicely complex, but there is room for on-going stories for the characters without seeming forced.  We just purchased Season 2 and are enjoying it as well.",1265500800,,451,4.730769230769231
2190791,5,B0006PTYP6,Truly refreshing and entertaining series with a great cast. The more you see it the more you get to know and understand the characters and their personalities which are varied and unique.,1264896000,,187,4.875
2190792,5,B0006PTYP6,"The series episodes stay on as high a level as the pilot.
The stories held my interest while the character development weaves in and out with humor and sometimes sadness.
Any detective show which can make me laugh several times while maintaining a serious story is worth the viewing time in my opinion.",1264118400,,302,4.716981132075472
2190793,5,B0006PTYP6,"If I could give more stars to this than 5 here at Amazon, I would.  This is my first major discovery of the new year.  Only in the UK would the basis of a show be about three retired detectives who come back to work for a driven babe suddenly demoted to head up the cold case squad. Three superb UK character actors play the senior detectives. The show is just as much about the comedy and drama of their own lives as it is about cold cases.  One detective is a three time divorcee yet ironically he is the big family man.  It is hilarious to see him having dinner either in or out with all three ex wives, his three daughters and his grandson.  His scenes with this entourage are priceless. Then there is the one who is OCD and has to take psychiatric medicine for same. His disability makes him a treasure trove of info about everything pertaining to police investigations.  There is no info too obscure for him. These two are rounded out by the third, the most respectable and distinguished of the three retirees.  However, he cannot recover from the loss of his wife to a hit and run driver when she was only 51.  So he talks to her shrine in the back yard and visits clairvoyants. And he was a detective chief inspector.  The babe is in charge of these three and keeping them under any semblance of control is the best she can achieve.  They run rings around her at every chance.  Best news of all is that this show is on its sixth season in the UK.

2190794,4,B0006PTYP6,"I liked the pilot cd and it had closed captioning. The next cd had a problem with closed captioning, It hinted that it was available but I could not get it to work. I have a hearing problem and with the English accents and mediocre sound in the BBC I cannot hear some of the dialog. I will not purchase any cd';s that do not have closed captioning.",1257724800,9,348,4.132352941176471

The chemistry between the characters and their blighted pasts makes this one of the most enjoyable police programs to come out of the UK since Cracker. I am so glad to finally have it in the US format. I had never seen the pilot episode before, it was worth the purchase price just to see it.",1254268800,7,361,4.246376811594203

2190800,5,B0006PTYP6,"I discovered this show on PBS and fell in love with it. It has just the right balance of humor and drama. My favorite character is Brian Lane. He is a hoot, played wonderfully by Alun Armstrong. The camaraderie in this group is so funny to watch. And the diversity of characters is a good catalyst for the story lines I've seen till now.

2190803,5,B0006PTYP6,"This is an extremely well written detective series.  The old detective techniques versus the new technological techniques.  All these different techniques blend well together, and the personalities of each ""older detective"" are entertaining, funny and work so well woven into each story.  I didn't think a detective series could live up to the standards of Inspector Morse or Inspector Frost, but this series certainly qualifies to be in that category of great acting, great story and great entertainment.  I surely hope I get to see the rest of the series.  This is the type of series that I will watch over and over again.  Wonderful entertainment and drama with great touches of humour.",1251590400,9,689,5.053097345132743
