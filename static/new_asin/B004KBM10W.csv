Should have stuck with the basics the jogging is silly",1368748800,,113,4.181818181818182
4396331,5,B004KBM10W,A nice variety of workouts - from high impact to using weights and stretch bands. It is great for any fitness level or age.,1362960000,,123,4.166666666666667
4396332,5,B004KBM10W,"I love Leslie Sansone and am thrilled to now how her 1 mile jog. I started out with her beginner walk videos. As my fitness level increased, I would purchase her more advanced videos--those with the boosted walks and/or intervals. This 1 mile jog is perfect for days I'm short on time. Most days I workout using a more intense BeachBody program, but on days I don't have an hour to workout or on days that I need to burn additional calories, I pop this in the DVD player and get my fast jog in. I have a BodyMedia Fit armband and it says I burn 157 calories doing the 1 mile jog. Not bad considering how little time it takes. At the end of this one mile jog, Leslie offers leg exercises for toning and the DVD comes with the needed stretchy band. It also includes a 2nd DVD that has a boosted walk, but so far I only use the jog DVD. If you like Leslie and need a quick calorie burn, then you'll love this DVD.",1343260800,16,910,4.089385474860335

8432687,5,B004KBM10W,"I did this DVD today for the first time.  There are two DVD's in the set and I did the 1 mile booster one.  It is Leslie leading a group of walkers.  They all are exercising either using weights, weighted balls or some type of resistance bands.  The leg movements are her standard workout moves.  Nothing complicated.  The arm movements are good for toning.  I enjoyed this DVD thoroughly and am glad to have it in my collection.",1416528000,,429,4.423076923076923
8432688,5,B004KBM10W,i love leslie sansone dvds espcially the ones with the jogging in them,1412380800,,70,4.461538461538462
8432689,5,B004KBM10W,I use this workout to change up and challenge myself.  I like the two options to walk or run.  Inc change up my workout.,1400371200,,120,3.9583333333333335
8432690,5,B004KBM10W,"I really enjoy Leslie Sansone's workouts. I was ready for more, and still even more than this. She has made jogging a mile at home easy.
  I had one problem with the dvd's, They became sticky and would not work. I tried to wipe them down quickly so I could use it, but was disappointed. Someone suggested the solution you use to clean your eyeglasses (not window cleaner). It took some doing, but the sticky came off and now it works fine.",1395705600,,439,4.341463414634147
8432691,1,B004KBM10W,Both DVDs had a sticky film on them and would not play in my DVD player.  I didn't return them because the price was only $4.99.,1390176000,,128,3.923076923076923
8432692,1,B004KBM10W,Expected 1 mile Jog and 1 Mile Booster with Resistance Band.  Instead received 1 mile Get Up and Get Going (intro video) and Two mile basic walk (again a beginner program).  This product was an add on item (under $5) so it isn't worth sending back but I am very disappointed with Amazon.,1383177600,,287,4.39622641509434
8432693,2,B004KBM10W,"I have arthritis in both knees so this DVD was not good for me.  I gave it a try, but cannot risk a serious injury.",1379289600,,115,3.6
8432694,4,B004KBM10W,"I have tried Leslie Sansone 1 Mile Jog and 1 Mile Booster and really enjoy it.  I have tried other products by Leslie Sansone and find them really fun to do and they give you the motivation to keep on trying.  If you want to start a new fitness style for yourself, this would be the one product to use and feel really satisfied with your choice.",1377043200,2,345,4.134328358208955
8432695,1,B004KBM10W,"When I opened the DVD case, the DVD was sticky with a substance more than likely from the enclosed resistance band.  It was unplayable.  I will say that Amazon was VERY quick in giving me back my money.  I'm really disappointed as I enjoy Leslie Sansone workouts and was looking forward to one with more jogging moves.  I'd love to have one that wasn't sticky, but I think with the way that they are packaged, it's probably not worth it to try again.",1371168000,,450,4.385542168674699
