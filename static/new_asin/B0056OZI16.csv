4592581,4,B0056OZI16,An older movie that still packs a punch. Wang Yu is fabulous. The sword play is grand and the special effects are realistic. I loved this movie.,1341792000,5,144,4.37037037037037
4592582,1,B0056OZI16,"I am writing this review to save someone the grief that I went through watching this movie. It is truly unbearable and I had to force myself to watch it entirely.
First of all, I'm a fan of this genre of movie. You usually have to put up with corny dialogue and choppy storyline to get rewarded with brilliantly choreographed and executed fight scenes.
I rate this movie one star because of the corny dialogue, choppy storyline and amateurish choreographed fights. The only good quality of this movie is that some of the background scenes of the landscape is spectacular.
You should also know that the first five minutes of video of this DVD is defective in that only parts of the video displays on your screen. The defective portion of the movie all occurs before the title of the movie displays across the screen and does not really interfere with the storyline.",1335744000,8,864,4.65359477124183
4592583,3,B0056OZI16,"I've purchase this DVD because I watched this film when I was about 12 years old in Vietnam. The DVD arrived in very good condition as they said and the quality is good. Except 1 or 2 missing scence in the film and the first 7 minutes of the film was dark (hardly seen at all & jumpy)...I don't know because of the DVD bad or they made it the way it is, otherwise if you knew and like the famous actors and actress in the movie (Wang Yu, Cheng Pei Pei, Lo Leih) like me then it's a good collection for your Chinese movie.",1320883200,18,521,3.9714285714285715
4592584,5,B0056OZI16,this movie was very good. The quality was great and the features were dynamic! also the choreographics was stunning. Im really glad to purchase this item from Amazon.com.,1318896000,12,170,5.107142857142857
4592591,5,B0056OZI16,"Great action, great fight scenes, skillful actors.  The plots tend to always be the same (avenging a murdered master, rescuing a kidnapped girl, challenging a drug lord, etc.).  But I watch them for the great choreographed fight scenes.",1402185600,,236,5.184210526315789
4592592,2,B0056OZI16,"Despite the title of this movie, ""Golden Swallow"", she is NOT the main character. She is NOT the focus of this movie. I consider this very misleading and dishonest!  It also happens to be a real dud, from Shaw Brothers.

Golden Swallow is a martial artist lady that fights with duel daggers, whom was injured and seperated from her love interest, Silver Roc at the beginning of the movie.

Silver Roc is a master swordsman in love with Golden Swallow and want to get back with her. He's also a vigilante and leaves a trail of lots of dead bandits as he searches on for Golden Swallow.

The different bandit gangs begrudge, Silver Roc and Golden Swallow and try killing them seperately through out the movie. This has a high body count of dead bandits, but the action is very lackluster. The action choregraphy looks very fake and has a shakey camera which makes it hard to see the super fake stunts.

Silver Roc, is a boring character because he barely speaks a few words at a time (trying to portray a strong and silent type). He always has a grim, serious look on his face. He spends most of his time with hookers in a brothel and the rest killing bandits.

Everytime, Silver Roc fought bandits, it would play out the same way. He swings his swords and several enemies fall dead SIMULTANEOUSLY  while the shakey, camera is always angled in a way that you cannot even see bandits getting slashed by, Roc's sword.

We get bits and pieces of Golden Swallow, reminiscing about her past and about her relationship with Silver Roc.  She at least has a more likable fun air about her, charisma that (Silver Roc, doesnt have) Half way through the movie Golden Swallow starts encountering more bandits that want to kill her.

Golden Swallow is a bit more interesting to watch fighting as she uses the duel daggers, but her scenes are short and doesnt focus on her.

The movie has a pacing problem, cheap fight scenes, boring characters, shakey camera and overall bad movie that didn't deserve to be ""remastered"".  I suspect that either a lot of the Amazon reviewes are PADDED (ie...fake), or the reviewers have poor tastes in Chinese martial arts movies. You should skip Golden Swallow. You've been warned.

You are better off getting the following Shaw Brothers movies:

Avenging Eagle

and

Five Element Ninjas

Trust me. those two movies are fantastic! You can thank me later:)",1397001600,4,2373,4.665865384615385
4592593,5,B0056OZI16,Excellent plot and storyline. Enjoyed the fight scenes and the sword play. The movie is worth the buy - enjoyed this movie totally.,1391472000,,131,4.739130434782608
4592594,4,B0056OZI16,Golden Swallow portays a strong female lead in actress Chang Pei Pei.  There are no low points and the action always holds one's attention.,1378080000,,139,4.791666666666667

4592596,3,B0056OZI16,"For some reason I thought this was a more recent film, however it's an older film and I think it was just released in the last several years either again, or for the first time.  You can tell it's definitely the old style beat em up movie with not very good conversation and lot's of bodies on the ground.  It was just an okay movie for me.",1366588800,2,340,4.059701492537314
4592597,4,B0056OZI16,I like watching these kind of movies from time to time. there was good action in it. I think the story line could have been better. maybe that's just me.,1366156800,,153,4.133333333333334
4592598,5,B0056OZI16,"How the hell did they get the name The Girl with the Thunderbolt Kick for this movie?  She uses daggers... anyway, this is Golden Swallow, the sequel to Come Drink With Me, and it's better in almost every way.  This time Chang Cheh directs and he makes it much darker than the original.  And they added Lo Lieh and Yu Wang to the cast!  I've had problems with Lo Lieh being a hero before, since he's such a great villain, but he was quite convincing this time.  He is a good friend to the title character, played by the amazing Cheng Pei-pei, though this sequel is less about Golden Swallow and more about an old acquaintance of hers:  Silver Roc, played by Yu Wang.  He is a rather relentless vigilante who kills in the name of Golden Swallow just to get her attention:  see he's still rather obsessed with her.  Cheng Pei-pei is a much better action performer in this film than she was in the first and has some great moments, but this is Yu Wang's movie and he lays waste to all sorts of villainous types from beginning to end.",1361923200,5,1030,4.322916666666667

8459838,2,B0056OZI16,I am a die hard martial arts fan with over 300 dvds to my collection. The positive is that it is dubbed in English for whatever that is worth. Unfortunately that is all I can say good about it. The acting is terrible but that is normal for many of these old school movies. But the fight scenes appear as if they are still being rehearsed and it was filmed like a walk through. The flying around is unbearable to me and in this case very poorly done. Even the usual martial arts plot ( You killed my Master) would have been better than the plot for this film. I would not even recommend that you watch this on television.,1409011200,2,620,4.175
