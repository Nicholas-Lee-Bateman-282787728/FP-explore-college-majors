4513779,5,B0050A52BC,This was a great series and lasted too short a time.  To have the complete series in a boxed set is a treat and it's wonderful to be able to sit and savor an episode without enduring the commercials of network tv.,1288051200,37,213,4.071428571428571
4513780,5,B0050A52BC,Great Series!!,1503446400,,14,6.5
4513781,5,B0050A52BC,This series is very fascinating to me.  It is not the ordinary cops and criminal show. The show how math (complex math) can solve all types of problems.  Anything by Riddly Scott is worth watching.  He's a wonderful director.,1503100800,,225,4.717948717948718
4513782,5,B0050A52BC,"We absolutely love this show! We wish they had continued for another 6 seasons. A lot of shows get stupid as they go along but this one, like ""Bones"", has stayed great. We watched it free on Amazon and decided to buy the DVDs because movies and shows aren't always free on Amazon.",1500336000,,280,4.30188679245283
4513783,5,B0050A52BC,"I love the Numb3rs series for several reasons.  I love the solving of the crime itself, but this show also deals with real life issues is a subtle enough way where it doesn't take over the solving of the crime. I love the cast!  It's on my top 5 favorite cast of actors for a show.  This might be in my top two!",1495584000,,311,3.9047619047619047
4513784,5,B0050A52BC,"My sister and I LOVE this series! We've only ever watched it when it was originally aired on television. When I saw it was available on DVD we were both thrilled! My 23 year old great nephew has discovered the series on Netflix and LOVES it too. In fact, when I finish watching a disc, he borrows it and watches it too. He stayed with me for a couple days and each night we watched episodes from 8pm until 1am and had a ball. The series still stands up to the test of time and is still fascinating to watch! Its intellectual as well as action and it has the family element in it that's fun as well. You can NOT go wrong with this series!",1493856000,,637,4.063492063492063
4513785,4,B0050A52BC,"Disk # 1 in season 1 is scratched... and consequently the shows do not play right.  The picture freezes and has a hard time continuing.  We have not watched all the other seasons yet; season 2 seems ok thus far.  Otherwise, we like the shows.",1492387200,,242,4.333333333333333
4513786,3,B0050A52BC,"Bought this some time ago and just opened and started to view.  For the most things are fine, but I am running into bad disks.  I really hate it when I run into a stoppage as that closes off the rest of the disk.  In year 3 it has happened to both disks one and two.  The quality of the disks video and sound are fine until I run into a complete stoppage.  Not a happy camper and I have yet to find a way to replaced just one disk.",1491696000,2,431,3.7444444444444445
4513787,1,B0050A52BC,Season 1 Disc 3 was full of scratch. Totally not worth it. I still have the other unopened discs because am not sure how many more damaged discs are nicely wrapped. Buy at your own risk if you want some awesome disappointment!. I don't know if I should return them or not.,1488758400,,272,4.25

4513792,3,B0050A52BC,I was disappointed that there were no closed caption episodes until the last season.  I have hearing loss and missed a lot of the dialogue.,1483315200,4,139,4.56
4513793,4,B0050A52BC,Another great show!!! It amazes me to watch them use the math on solving crimes!!!,1482796800,,82,4.533333333333333
4513794,5,B0050A52BC,The packaging is perfect and the disks all played with no problems. I very much enjoy the series and wish other similar shows would take a lesson and stop being such soap operas. The series managed to keep focused on math all the way through.,1482710400,,242,4.4

4513801,5,B0050A52BC,"Ok, I like the show or I wouldn't have purchased the DVD set.

The DVDs are boxed well. Each DVD in it's own tray.

Individual trays protect the DVDs. I hate it when DVDs come in cardboard slots instead of trays.",1480464000,,212,4.146341463414634

4513805,5,B0050A52BC,Ive been a fan since i first saw the show. Although i was never much for mathematics i feel as though you can really understand and get a grasp on what charlie talks about when he uses math plus it gives you the intensity of a crime show like tose of csi and ncis and others and having all 6 seasons in one set is cool .,1476921600,,320,3.791044776119403
4513806,5,B0050A52BC,NUMBERS was a great TV series.  I'm really enjoying watching these episodes again.,1475452800,,82,5.3076923076923075

Binge watched it for  many of weeks (we watch one episode a day in the evening and a few on the weekends)  It will be back into the rotation soon, as we just enjoy it!  Nice to know math is so important and a tv program builds around that!",1474416000,,320,4.112903225806452

4513828,5,B0050A52BC,"This is a great show.  It makes math fun by teaching it using using plain English analogies and philosophy. Which forced me to think about math and how it is done.  The producers had a mathematician on the production crew to make sire what ""Charlie"" was scribbling on the blackboard actually worked.  I barely eked out a C in math in high school, but this show made it fun and interesting. Now I understand math much better, even intimately.  The stories were good but the math and philosophy is what made it awesome.",1459036800,,517,4.526881720430108

4513834,5,B0050A52BC,"One of the most intelligent and unusual shows produced in recent memory.  The quirky characters, the brain teasing plots, the rapid action all make for satisfying viewing.  I love forensic shows--have been a die hard fan of CSI and collected the original and its various spinoffs.  This show is in the same league with the added charm of this all-male family of widower father and two brothers, who like any pair of siblings are close and at odds.  The fact that one is a university mathematics prof and number genius and the other a practical minded FBI agent makes the sibling conflict even more interesting.  Am delighted that the complete series of Numb3rs is available at an affordable price.  I'll have many hours of viewing pleasure to look forward to as I watch them, and then watch them again and again.",1457308800,,812,4.723404255319149
4513835,4,B0050A52BC,"I have such mixed feelings about this TV series. As a mathematician I was delighted to see math so prominently featured.  I also liked the fact that they introduced some real mathematics into the program. What I had trouble with was the extremes they pushed, and more so as the series progressed.  Charlie Epps was more wizard than mathematician. He could do anything better than anyone else. He knew hacking, finger printing, engineering, etc....and all better than experts in those fields.  Math is wonderful, but it is not magic.",1457136000,2,532,4.955056179775281
4513836,5,B0050A52BC,Love this series. I am so glad that I can watch it again and again.,1455148800,,67,3.533333333333333

My only disappointment is that two of the seasons, 4,5 had broken disc holders.",1444953600,,283,4.185185185185185

4513844,5,B0050A52BC,Great Series,1441670400,,12,5.5
4513845,5,B0050A52BC,This was a great series while it was running on TV and now I can continue watching with the excellent dvd in this set. The seasons are separated so you can keep track of what point in the series you are watching. The wedding of Charlie and Amita in the finale was great to watch.,1439510400,,279,4.090909090909091
4513846,3,B0050A52BC,"The first three season were good, but things starting going down hill for me in the fourth.  The primary stories were still good and interesting, but the side ones they were making, especially with the dad, just left a bad taste in my mouth.  They should have killed him off.  The low point for me is in season five, when they start coaching basketball.  Really?  Honestly, I barely got through that episode.  I'm not sure if the creative process dried up or if just the wrong person was providing the input, either way, I saw it as the beginning of the end.

The first 3 seasons, and most the 4th, were great watching while on the treadmill.  Time flew by.  Once the side stories started going downhill, it was a bit like torture.  Time started to crawl.  At one time, I looked really forward to watching a new episode, but then I just started dreading it, because I wondered what stupid thing are they going to bring up with the Dad (really, they should of had him killed).

Anyway, the good thing is all seasons are on Amazon Prime.  If you've got it, that's the place to check it out.",1438387200,,1088,4.38
4513847,5,B0050A52BC,I originally purchased this as a Christmas gift for my Son. My wife and Son really enjoy the show; I have not watched it myself. They love having the ability to watch the whole series over and over.,1438128000,,198,4.2368421052631575

4513856,3,B0050A52BC,"I love the show, obviously, or I would not spend the money on it.  The show is not what I am reviewing.  The set I received is not a boxed set.  There are six individual seasons wrapped together in cellophane.  The individual cases are not even the same size.  Two of the cases have crushed spines.  I checked inside the case of each season to see if any of the disks were damaged, they don't appear to be.  I am only on season two and so far all of the disks have worked.  I hope this will continue to be the case because it will take me a while to see them all.  I don't have the time or inclination for video marathons.",1426118400,6,622,3.991869918699187

The story focuses on one brother who is an FBI agent and the other brother who is a professor of math and a prodigy.

The writing and cinematography is fantastic.  It was one of the best crime dramas during its tenure and it is still one of my all time favorite television series.",1407715200,2,451,4.451219512195122

It seems I'm stuck with season 3 disc one that I have to replace by purchasing a new one.  Amazon, you need to give people an option for reporting this stuff.

The series provided a whole new twist to the thought that I would never use math after graduation.  I love the family dynamic between the two brothers and the intelligent interaction of all the characters.  The exploration of science vs. spiritual is especially thought provoking.

4513902,3,B0050A52BC,"This show was one of the best of its kind during the time it was on the air, and remained so for years after its cancellation and syndication run. I have owned this set for about 3 years now and continue to return to it as a mainstay when I want to watch something on my tele that really fascinates me and holds my interest. And now, since I no longer subscribe to cable television, I only view DVD's for my viewing entertainment, many of which are television shows I have on DVD. This is one I have never get tired of watching.

About the show, I really have only two qualms that the writers did with the show. One was how they seemed to keep forgetting to deal with the lines for the actors, when they are chasing down the bad guys because they keep forgetting to shout out that they are the FBI before they tell them to stop, when they are going to shoot them. Many times the people they are chasing are also running from mobsters or other baddies as well as from certain law enforcement officials and would actually enjoy the protection of the FBI at that moment if only they would show up. The trouble is they see these guys with guns coming at them and telling them to stop where they are and put their hands up or else, but nothing else. So we, the viewers understand why they don't want to stop for them, but the FBI team just gets really mad when these guys keep running away from them instead of stopping and I'm sitting there thinking, ""well, gee, why don't you tell them you're the FBI or something? How are they supposed to know who you are anyway?""

The other qualm I had was about how they sometimes handled David Sinclair's character, giving him such a holier-than-thou attitude during times when he came up against certain characters who either had too much money and continued making more, at least according to him, or worked at a profession that was not up to his high moral standards. Why they would bother having him make comments on these things to the point that it almost carried the episode was beyond me, because if a regular FBI agent showed such bias toward certain suspects or clients, he certainly wouldn't last long or go far in the agency. Thankfully this idiosyncrasy didn't show itself too frequently and therefore kept the show a continuous joy to watch, despite those few times.

My other major issue with this DVD set, and the main reason I'm giving it 3 stars is the crappy and terrible construction of the DVD cases for each of the first 3 seasons. The plastic holders that hold 2 of the 6 DVD's in those cases practically fell out of the holders. Each plastic 2-disc holder was held onto the page by Elmers glue at the 4 corners of the holder and the first time I began taking the discs out the glue just gave up the ghost and fell apart. I have since tried to repair the pages by adding more glue but they continue to come undone. Its like they need to be riveted or something. I have other TV series that have booklets like that but hold their own (the Dead Zone, for example), but this just drives me crazy that I can't get these to stay down.

Anyway, I don't know if anybody else had that problem. I hope you didn't. Because otherwise, the show itself is a great one and even with the hassle's I had with the holders, I still really love having the show and encourage others to buy it.",1368489600,13,3331,4.333333333333333

Well written and well acted.  David Krumholtz as the primary character did a superb job, as did his character's college collegues.

Though a crime solving show, it was refreshingly free of gratuitous violence and profanity, focusing on problem solving skills and thoughtful personalities, not to mention the value of education.
Interesting lighting in the warm tones at college and at home, whilst cool blues and grays at the FBI offices.  I enjoyed the Epps family of men and their wonderful craftsman home too.

4513929,5,B0050A52BC,"Numb3rs - The full six seasons.

Dear all: I have been advised that this review has a number of 'spoilers'. They all occur in the last paragraph. Read them at your risk.

  I got this set because the only time there are any Numb3rs reruns is from 3 - 5 AM, on one of the basic cable channels, and I am very fond of the show. On the one hand, there is a sense of being a copy of the CSI / Bones / Criminal Intent / NCIS formula, but I believe there are important differences.

  One is the level of realism. Unlike the `forensic specialists' in the series I mentioned above, the `science guy', Professor Charles Eppes (David Krumholtz), never goes running around after bad guys or knowingly puts himself in dangerous situations. That is left to his brother, the Supervisory Special Agent of the FBI, Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his team. The other side of the equation (to coin a phrase) is that when Charlie does his stuff, you can get much closer to the technique he is using than you can with either Abby Schiuto or Temperance Brennan (unless you happen to have aced a course in anatomy. Math is something you can explain entirely in words and symbols which can come across on the screen. (This would even have been a great radio premise, if this kind of show were trendy in radio days). I confess I am much more comfortable with set theory, Venn diagrams, and Fibonacci numbers than I am with tibias, fibulas, and kerf marks. Similarly, the FBI action part seems far more realistic than what we see on Bones or Criminal Minds. I believe the FBI agents do not operate like Seeley Booth, as one man operations, or like the profilers in Criminal Minds, who often find themselves in gunfights, even the geeky one.

  On top of the police action, there is the constant interplay between the three family members, who head the cast, filled out by the masterful Judd Hirsch. We get a small, dysfunctional (actually rather painful) sense of this when Ryan O'Neal showed up as Temperance Brennan's father, where the story was laden with lots of improbabilities and events to which few people can relate. Problems between these three are real, everyday things, like who will fix the pump in the Koi pond and dust the cobwebs from the wainscoting. There are big ones too, as when pressure on Charlie breaks his usually cool abstractness and he can't apply himself to one of Don's cases.

  The third dimension is the connections between Charlie and the FBI with Charlie's CalSci colleagues, Physics professor Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol)  and Eppes prot&eacute;g&eacute; / Professor / Lover Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat). The most delightful aspect of this dimension is when Larry enters a romantic relation with FBI profiler, Megan Reeves (Diane Farr). The writers avoid the mistake of overplaying the oddness of this pairing. In the seasons where this was a factor, I saw but two references to the `Odd Couple' aspect.

  A fourth dimension is the interplay between the lead FBI agents in Don Eppes' team, David Sinclair (Almi Ballard) and Colby Grainger (Dylan Bruno). These come to a head in the fourth season opener, directed by Executive Producer Tony Scott, and guest starring Val Kilmer.
The writing on this series is simultaneously just a bit banal and deeply insightful. Every two or three episodes, there is a statement which makes you sit up and take notice. One can attribute the banality to the fact that conversations between FBI agents is probably a bit routine. On the other hand, we can expect that the conversation between a world class mathematician, his Physics mentor, and his mathematics prot&eacute;g&eacute; will have some substance to it, even if more time is spend on their personal interactions and problems than on math and physics.

  So, if you are fond of this show, having all six years is almost a necessity; however, the earlier seasons do tend to be better than the last two, when actor, Diane Farr leaves the cast and the Larry Fleinhardt character becomes less interesting. I also tend to find the extras in the earlier seasons to be more interesting, and more abundant in the earlier seasons, where we get several episodes with alternate commentary soundtracks from actors, director, writer, and producer. Two of the six seasons are shorter than usual, because it was a late first season addition and the fourth season fell during a writer's strike. But that is true of most shows.

  If you simply don't like Numb3rs, you gain nothing by buying this. But if you are a big fan of the show, you need this set.

Spoilers start here. STOP, if you have not already seen the series!!!

  My only disappointments with the series was the way it was abruptly brought to a close with Charlie and Amita's quick, informal wedding, Diane Farr's departure, and the role of the Head of the Mathematics, Physics, and Astronomy department, Mildred Finch, played by Kathy Najimy. Except as a fill-in, while MacNicol left the cast for a few months, the part added little to the character mix.",1293840000,68,5008,4.746251441753172

8451013,5,B0050A52BC,"This is a series that should make you shiver in your armchair, not of cold but of mental disruption, in other words, it will make you lose your mind. The idea is that everything is mathematical and everything can be reduced to statistical, numerical networks of equations and operations that dictate everything that may or might happen on this earth or in the universe. Welcome to an absolute Asperger autistic vision of life and the world. But if you neglect looking at the equations (they go too fast) or listening to the numbers and the theories that use all kinds of names for all kinds of arcane notions, every single one weirder than the previous or the next, you may survive the drowning bath they are trying to give you, to make you go through. Dont worry ressurection is guaranteed at the end of each episode

Then you will also be surprised by the fact that the three main characters are Jewish but so far from their religion that we hardly know about it. No Shabbat, no synagogue, no whatever could be in anyway Jewish. It must be mentioned less than a dozen times and a synagogue is actually visited twice. I guess in Los Angeles you can be a totally agnostic Jew with no problem at all.

The third element is the triad of Eppes characters.

The father has been a widower for a long time and his wife is only a recollection, a passing mention, an allusion, but no real presence, not even in a flashback of any sort. And she was supposed to be a very good mother. In fact, she must have been since the younger son, Charles was autistic, the Asperger savant type, and he was classified a genius by the age of fourteen and he got a Ph. D. when most people get their high school degree. And of course in mathematics. That makes him a rather simple autistic Asperger case. Mathematics and the capacity to see patterns everywhere and develop equations and theories to justify his intuition.

His second autistic characteristic is his difficulty to have standard relationships with others that could be in any way more than dealing with numbers and I must say it took him five seasons to finally ask Amita to marry him. Some will, of course, tell me she was his student. For sure, but that did not prevent them from sleeping together long before getting married. It is just that he cannot establish a full emotional stable relationship with anyone, even his father and especially his elder brother who has become an FBI cop. Strangely enough in this family the young genius Charles is accepted and supported by mother (so they say), father and elder brother all the time, and Charles is not that keen on being intimate with his own brother and having a fair relationship with his father for a couple of season because he is living in his fathers house.

The point is that things start changing when the father wants to sell the house and buy a condo for himself to have a private personal life, and Charles, unknown of anyone, buys the house and becomes the landlord of his own father who accepts to stay and the house becomes a real commune, the three men of course, though the elder son seems to have an apartment somewhere though he does not have any stable relationship with anyone, woman or man. His life is an FBI caricature and for him, everyone is nothing but a partner, I mean a patrol partner.

That leads this Don Eppes to propose his younger brother who is a professor of Applied Mathematics at the local university christened Cal-Sci, to become a consultant for the FBI with his mathematics. That changes the life of the younger brother who moves slightly loose in his teaching position and becomes more and more integrated into the FBI. In fact his autistic personality makes him become obsessive and compulsive in his onepointedness that becomes then catching crimimnals and even prebventing them from becoming criminals, and all that thanks to mathematics. Such changes in life are of course normal in many ways, not necessarily dramatic, and yet they are very dramatic indeed, at times tragic. But no matter how authoritarian he is in his attitude with everyone, he is absolutely not able to lead people and become what his elder brother is, the chief officer of a whole elite team of criminal cops. He can only be the prophet that shows the way but not the leader that goes down this way. He is an abstract mental roadsign and his brother is the leader of the pack of agents he takes to the crime scene or after the criminal Charles has pointed at.

That then leads us to that elder son and brother who is a very good authoritative and respected chief officer, though inner affairs and trauma-psychiatrists are flabbergasted by his resistance and in fact predict he will sooner or later break down and lose his control over the crazy facts of criminal life. But he does not have the human dimension he could have in his own private life because he does not have a private life, even with the local District Attorney or Prosecutor.

Amita Ramanujan is Indian and she came to Los Angeles as a student in computer science. She fell in love with her mathematics professor and her mathematics professor fell in love with his student, which was tricky as long as she was a student, though he made her his assistant as a graduate student preparing for a Ph. D. and when she got it she refused a position in some Eastern prestigious university to stay in this university where theory is not the objective but applied science is the norm. She will end up at the end of season five with Charles kneeling at her feet and proposing, finally proposing. And in the last season, the marriage is actually announced. For a Hindu girl she is extremely calm and Charles autism, Asperger in this case, does not seem to trouble her, to bother her. She just waits for him to move. She knows at least that much: you cannot force an autistic child to do anything that child does not want to do. You have to run with him and follow his inspiration.

If you can swim through the numbers and the equations, knowing anyway that most of them must be fictitious, you might enjoy the action that is criminal for sure but with a light entertaining side to it, even when it is gross and full of blood. After all, it is only a TV story. I should, of course, quote a last perambulating erring character who is an applied physics professor Larry Fleinhardt but he is a dilettante. He spends six months in Space. He is always roaming around with a bit or piece of a theory, with some raspberries or other goodies, he even gets into Buddhism for a while and lives in a monastery, though he spends a lot of time in his own office turned into a den, or even underground in the sewers before finally accepting to be a perambulating lodger in Charles house, though at first with great reluctance that I seem to think is slightly hypocritical, if not slightly more.

I should, of course, get to the end of the series but I definitely must let you have something to discover by your own means. So enjoy your adventure.
