4255132,3,B0043CT8KO,"The Beverly Hills Chihuahuas are back!

Papi and Chloe return for another adventure in the sequel to the popular children's movie ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"".

Since the '90s, Walt Disney Home Entertainment has successfully bringing talking (voice-over) canines to live action films which began with the ""Air Bud"" films to its ""Buddies"" and ""Santa Paws"" films and the fun continues with this direct-to-video film which features the return of many of the canine characters from the first film.

In the sequel, both Papi (voiced by George Lopez) and Chloe (voiced by Odette Yusman) have just gotten married. Hardcore dog lover, aunt Viv (played by Susan Blakely) has thrown a luxurious party to celebrate the wedding of both dogs and now Sam Cortez (played by Marcus Coloma) and Rachel (played by Erin Cahill) are talking about marriage.

But with aunt Viv and Rachel planning a trip to the rainforest, Sam and Rachel can discuss it later but for now, the celebration is for the marriage of Papi and Chloe.

Four months later and we see that Papi and Chloe are parents of five young chihuahua: One boy, Papi Jr. and four girls, Rosa, Pep, Lala and Ali.

Chloe is starting to get upset with Papi because he acts more like a playmate to his kids than a father and she wants him to show authority, since the kids are starting to pick up on their father's bad habits.

But Papi feels that being a father is quite difficult but he's ready to try, in order to make Chloe happy.

Sam then takes Papi, Chloe and the kids to meet with his family in Los Angeles to meet with his parents and their dog Pedro (voiced by Ernie Hudson).  Upon arriving, the little ones are afraid of Pedro because of his menacing smile but Papi let's them know that his brother is a nice dog.

As for Sam, he finds unpaid bills at his parent's home and is very concerned.  Mr. Cortez tells Sam that they are unable to pay their bills and now they are in danger of being evicted.  Because Mr. Cortez threw his back, he is unable to work and through the landscaping business, and with the economy so bad, the only employee left is Sam.

Unfortunately, the Cortez are behind by $40,000 and if they don't pay it, they will lose the house. At first Sam considers asking Viv (because she is wealthy) but Mr. Cortez will not allow it because it is a family affair.  And if they lose the house, Sam's parents would have to move to Arizona to live with Mr. Cortez' sister.

Meanwhile, as for Papi, Chloe and their kids, Chloe is starting to get upset that Papi tells them stories and the kids acting out on it.  As Papi loves telling the stories of the chihuahua warriors, Papi Jr. jumps on the window ledge to pretend his fighting a snake.  But he falls off the ledge and before he crashes down on the pavement, he is rescued by a familiar friend, the German Shepard Mexican police dog, Delgado (voiced by Miguel Ferrer).

Delgado has come to Los Angeles in hopes that Chloe can help him out.  Delgado tells her a story that he had two children but while on a case, a criminal threatened to kills his two German Shepherd pups and in order to prevent them from getting hurt, Delgado took them to the LAPD and dropped them off anonymously and to save him from being hurt, he never said goodbye.  His two pups have now grown up to become part of the K-9 division of the LAPD and he just wants to talk to them, but his two dogs are still hurt about their father abandoning them.

As Sam and his family try to get the bank to give them time enough to raise money to pay for the house, unfortunately the bank won't wait.  As the bank visits the house the next following day, they try to inspect the house but Papi and friends will not allow it.  They prevent the employees from staying in the house and it angers the bank rep even more and tells them that instead of getting two weeks, now they are expected to leave immediately by nighttime.

Stressed and not knowing what to do, Sam gets a call from Rachel and he explains to her the problem but Sam will not allow her to help or talk to her Aunt Viv.  Sam tells her that it is a family problem but Rachel tells him that she is family as they are supposed to get married but still, Sam won't allow it and Rachel is heartbroken.

Not sure what they can do, Chloe sees her rival Appoline in the newspaper and reads that there is a dog show that night and the winner can win $50,000.  More than enough money for the Cortez to save their home.

So, Papi, Chloe, Delgado and Pedro decide to take part in the dog show to win the money and Sam and the Cortez are hoping one of them will win.

Can they win the dog show and get the money needed to save the Cortez' home?

VIDEO:

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2' is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio) and the PQ is great!  The colors are vibrant and while the costume design are not as super-detailed like the first film (as there was impressive costume designs in the previous film), the sequel still manages to hold up by its frequent daytime shots.  Colors really pop out for this film and the detail on the chihuahua is well-done.

It's important to note that as the last film would focus on many locations, the primary focus of this second film is inside the home of the Cortez family or at Viv's mansion ala indoors.  While the outdoor shots are typically outside of the home until you get to the dog show and with the puppies roaming around Los Angeles.

Blacks are nice and deep, the flashbacks show effective lighting and skin tones, pigmentation, stubble, fabric, grass, dirt to the hairs of the dogs are well-detailed.  There is a good amount of grain, but you tend to see some low-light noise at ties.

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2' is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily center channel and front channel driven.  There are times during the film especially the scene with the dog show in which you hear crowd ambiance, cameras taking pictures of the dogs but the film is primarily center and front-channel driven, dialogue is absolutely clear while the film also tends to showcase quite a bit of music.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2"" is a fun and enjoyable family film!  If your children loved the first film or if they loved Disney's ""Buddies"" or ""Santa Paws"" films, they will definitely enjoy this sequel!

There was no doubt that there was going to be a sequel to ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"".  As the first film grossed over $29 million in its opening weekend and $117 million worldwide, similar to the ""Air Bud"" films from Disney during the the late '90s, you pretty much knew there would be direct-to-video sequels and to capitalize on the future of original film and have future installments, the main characters would have to produce children and sure enough, similar to how ""Air Bud"" spun off to having ""Buddies"" films, I wouldn't be surprised if we started seeing films starring these little chihuahuas.

While the first film had star power, the direct-to-video does feature a good number of talent especially the return of George Lopez and Odette Yustman to provide the voices of Papi and Chloe, as with Miguel Ferrer returning as the voice of Delgado.  We have a new Aunt Viv, a new Sam Cortez and a new Rachelle for this sequel and for the most part, these three do a good job and one can only hope that for future installments, to keep things consistent, hopefully Disney uses these same talents for the next film.  It was one thing about the ""Air Bud"" films that would get out of hand, you had the same kid but always different talents playing the parents or sister.  Hopefully, we see Marcus Coloma, Erin Cahill and Susan Blakeley return in the near future.

Also, what makes this sequel different aside from one having a larger budget and was a film as opposed to a direct-to-video release, the first film tend to balance a storyline between Sam and Rachel's growing relationship and Papi and Chloe's relationship to appeal to both parents and children.  While ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2' does tend to focus more on the dogs, especially the puppies and thus targeting a younger demographic, there is a storyline for adults that is relevant and that is how the downward economy is hurting family's and in this case, Sam's parents are losing their home.  So, while children may not understand this, it is a storyline that adults can understand and also share interest in this film, so ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2' appeals to audiences of all ages.  But this sequel is definitely more geared for the younger children.

As for the Blu-ray release, parents will get the best of both worlds as the Blu-ray release does come with a DVD, which is perfect for family's on long commutes, especially before Spring Break and the Summertime.  This film will definitely keep children busy.  Picture quality is very good for this Blu-ray, as the lossless audio is very good but not too immersive but still clear and understandable.  And there are a few special features which are once again more targeted for a younger demographic.

Overall, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2' is different from its predecessor but still family-geared.  While I do enjoy the first film much more (primarily because it was a film, higher budget, various locations and had a romcom storyline between Sam and Rachel, I do feel that the younger audience and their parents will still enjoy this film.

The sequel is more geared towards the young viewers and if you have children who enjoyed the first film, the ""Buddies"" or ""Santa Paws"" films, they are definitely going to enjoy this movie as well. In fact, I recommend this film to parents who are looking for a safe family film to watch with their children.",1296691200,5,10780,4.618372703412073
4255133,3,B0043CT8KO,"Chloe and Papi get married and have a litter of puppies. The dogs enter a dog show to try to win money to save a house from foreclosure, and then solve a bank robbery. Delgado, the German Shephard, makes an appearance.
Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is cute, but the plot is not nearly as good as Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Also, #2 would have been better if the original actors were in this movie too.
Overall, cute, but not great. Beverly Hills Chihuahua was much better. You should rent it before you buy it. Even my kids didn't want me to buy it, after watching it.",1296518400,25,562,4.3619047619047615
4255134,1,B0043CT8KO,"This one is 'For the Dogs' folks. It's a Disney 'Direct to DVD' attempt to cash in on it's successful 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua'. Didn't Disney announce that they wouldn't do 'Direct to DVD' anymore...you know, quality, not quantity? Think 'Mulan 2' and 'Stitch: The Movie'. Get the (insert gagging sounds here) picture? Only George Lopez returns as the voice of 'Papi', probably because of a contractual agreement? I hope he didn't need the cash that bad. Anyways, if you must see this franchise killer, rent it, don't buy it. I wish I would have. I've already tried hitting the DVD with a rolled up newspaper, and that didn't help it any. Now I'll probably have to pawn this 'Dog' off on my in-laws as a birthday or Christmas gift.",1296518400,26,732,4.682170542635659

That being said, my wife enjoyed watching it twice in one day. I passed out the first time she watched it, and she didn't mind watching it a second time.  If anything, she seemed to enjoy watching it more the second time.  It's romantic and funny, and seems to advocate good morals, such as family, friendship, loyalty and love.  It also features a lot of cute dogs, and a couple ugly ones.

4255267,1,B0043CT8KO,"I bought this after buying Beverly Hills Chihuahua and was so disappointed. The film was really bad, the acting and screenplay was awful and they completely rewrote the characters! The charm of the first movie is gone, because Chloe and Papi got hitched (a big mistake in my opinion). Chloe is now a nagging mommy and Papi is a doting irresponsible husband. The children just add to the bad quality of the film because they have a scrappy-do annoying quality that hogs the screen during key moments.

What I enjoyed about the first film was Chloe. (Sorry, never a Papi fan). Chloe was the star, and her `fish out of water' antics in Mexico were cute. She was a spoiled little dog, but fun to watch. All that has changed now. Chloe is the `bad guy' in the relationship playing the responsible one, to Papi's befuddled dad routine..  That has been done to death in Hollywood. Think Homer simpson.

The acting was very flat as well. The actors just seemed to `go through the motions,' with very little convincing emotional realism. Terrible. I miss the old Chloe, who didn't have a passel of bratty Chihuahua kids and Papi to ride herd on.

Worse, the message was pretty bad. I'm sorry, but when you are a parent, you don't get to do what your heart tells you to do, and `love' doesn't solve all you problems.  Parenting is a job, as is marriage and LOVE is wonderful and necessary, but there is more to it than that. There is hard work involved, planning, and mutual commitment.  I get it is a film for kids, but the adults in the room were rolling their eyes during the discussion of parenting, and how all you need is love to make a marriage work.  Sorry.

I lost interest during the slapstick moments where Chloe and Papi were terrorizing the poor bank people who were just trying to do their job. I just don't see Chloe and Papi tripping people, and making them fall off ladders. Not funny and not safe.

I liked the film to be more about dogs, than people. Having so much people interaction, changes into the casting, and the poor screenwriting ruined this film. Too bad. The first was adorable. This was a made for tv quality dud.",1361750400,3,2134,4.493540051679586

In reality, my kids LOVE this movie! We have probably 100 or so kids movies, and they have about 5 ""go-to"" movies; ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2"" or ""Cats vs. Dogs 2:The Revenge of Kitty Galore."" They don't watch part one as much as this one for whatever reason. The dogs in this movie ARE cute and I'm not sure if there is a story or plot, but talking cute dogs are a HUGE attraction to children. It's not too annoying either to have on in the background as the kids watch it. The 6 year old boy loves it the most. Always gets a laugh at the cute talking chihuahuas!

In summary, if you would like a movie that your kids will watch endless ammounts of times over and over and over and over, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2"" is a great one! Highly recommended for kids who like animals. And regular kids too.  And parents who want to slip off while their kids are watching talking chihuahuas.",1327622400,8,1148,4.305555555555555

4255336,2,B0043CT8KO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

For those of you who loved Beverly Hills Chihuahua (including myself), I am sad to report that Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is not a worthy sequel to its enormously entertaining predecessor. Obviously patched together rather quickly to capitalize on the success of Chihuahua #1, BHC2 is a straight to DVD concoction. All the actors have been replaced except for George Lopez who reprises the voice of Papi. Also missing are stars Jaime Lee Curtis, who had a short but effective role as the dog loving businesswoman, Aunt Viv, and Drew Barrymore who had the starring (voice) role as Chloe.

BHC2 begins right away with the wedding of Papi and Chloe. A few months later Chloe gives birth to a brood of five pups, four girls and a boy. Chloe's owner, Rachel and her mother Aunt Viv, are off on a trip to the Amazon rain forest and have even lesser roles here than in the original 'Chihuahua'. The audience is further short-changed when Delgado, the German Shepard former police dog, is relegated to a supporting role as he attempts to locate his long lost 'sons' who are now police dogs for LAPD.

It takes a very long time before we break into 'Act 2' in BHC2 and that occurs when Sam and his parents (the Cortez's) are faced with losing the family home. While BHC1 had a menacing and realistic drug cartel member as an antagonist (coupled with his equally scary canine counterpart, 'El Diablo'), all BHC2 can muster up is a buffoonish bank executive, entrusted with taking possession of the Cortez family home.

Sam needs to come up with $50K cash so they decide to enter a prestigious dog show. Somehow, the dogs are allowed to enter the contest without any investigation into their pedigree. It's only after Papi ends up winning (by arranging flower petals into the shape of a heart) that it finally occurs to the stuffy lead judge, that Papi isn't a full pedigree. Papi is disqualified and Sam is back to square one, trying to figure out how to get the cash to prevent foreclosure of their home.

The 'dark moment' at the end of the Second Act occurs when the puppies follow Delgado who's still looking for his long lost sons. Sam, Papi and Chloe are frantic that the little ones are now lost. The puppies end up in duffel bags containing stolen cash, carried by criminals who have just robbed a bank. Papi's brother, Pedro, finds a cap belonging to the one of the robbers and the scent leads the dogs to a bread factory, where they rescue the puppies and chase the robbers out, into the arms of the police.

Unlike BHC1, which had an extremely inventive plot and all kinds of interesting characters and production numbers (remember that wonderful 'Aztec warrior' Chihauhau dance?), BHC2 is simply a formulaic Disney second-rate comedy. While BHC1 was full of laugh out loud jokes, BHC2 simply expects us to laugh merely by offering up a bunch of talking dogs without the wit of the original. For those who haven't seen BHC1, please pick up a copy; and try to forget the sequel!",1302307200,3,3019,4.644194756554307

(1.) Well trained dogs.
(2.) Pretty good CG on dog talking.

Negatives:
(1.) Another in a long line of cheaply produced Disney movies.
(2.) Missed a creative opportunity (as if Disney even knows what that means anymore) by not having a scenario where the dogs journey down to Central America to rescue their owner. Instead it's the same old safe, boring studio and local mansion sites for filming. Thus the tone is set - boring (unless you're dog obsessed; which means anything with a dog in it is a no-brainer, pun intended).",1300492800,,537,4.774193548387097

My Opinion: The movie started off with a wedding between Papi and Chloe but to be honest the beginning was really confusing with the focus mainly on best man and maid of honor.  After a few minutes, the dogs getting married was focused on.  Since my little ones would be the one watching this movie, I was not overly thrilled with the dress of the adults but their attire was normal wedding apparel.

Then the puppies are born...these five little puppies are absolutely adorable.  I just love when all 5 puppies sliding down in the mud and Chloe comes out to admonish them.  She tells all 5 puppies how their father will hear about this and he will not be happy.  As she is stating this, Papi shows up the top of the slide, yelling loud,  encouraging his young ones to have fun, slides right into the mud splashing Chloe as well.

Throughout the movie, Papi and Chloe learn how to be parents.  Papi must learn to properly train his children and to be a proper parent; whereas, Chloe has to learn to let up from time to time and have fun.  All throughout the movie, you see fun puppy antics.  This movie is definitely geared toward children and as an adult I had a hard time sitting through the whole movie.

This movie has no swearing, a little bit of adult humor, and is definitely geared for children.",1297900800,,2870,4.649298597194389

4255353,3,B0043CT8KO,"This movie was alright... the plot was 'out there' but it was cute as far as a talking dog movie goes.
But the cast wasn't the same (as the first one) and even the dogs looked different. For a 'sequel' it wasn't good.
I think you need the orginal cast to call it a 2. But who am I to say?
My kid REALLY wanted to see it, I paid $10 (give or take) for a blu ray or I could have rented it on vudu for $6.99.
Overall its a good deal. I guess I coulda got it cheaper at the redbox, but still... I get two really bad dvds for $10.. who can pass that up?! lol.
Nah.. my kid liked it and it didn't make her cry like Despicable Me did. And it kept my attention longer... or maybe its because I was so out of my mind from watching BHC2 that I couldn't sit to watch DM in the same night... IDK So 3 stars...",1297814400,3,797,3.7218934911242605

4255357,5,B0043CT8KO,"The spicy and funny little dogs are back! If you thought that ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" was the first and last installment of a possible successful franchise, think again. The original movie apparently generated a good response, so Disney didn't waste any time and released a brand new one. And I'm happy to say that ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2"" is as funny and charming as the first one, and I believe that better, too. It is great fun for all the family.

The film begins with our two furry friends -- Papi and Chloe -- getting married in a majestic way, in a luxurious church in Beverly Hills, followed by an elegant reception, with its respective mariachi, and with guests including people and their dogs.  Move four months later, and Papi and Chloe become proud parents of five puppies - four females and one male. We see them struggling - especially Papi -, trying to be good parents.

About the same time, Rachel (Erin Cahill) and Aunt Viv (Susan Blakely) decide to take a vacation to the Amazon, and they leave Sam (Marcus Coloma) to take care of Papi, Chloe and all their puppies. One day, Sam takes the gang to his parent's house for a visit, and he is informed by his father that they are going to loose their house because they are behind in payments. They have to get $40,000 in three weeks, in order that they can keep their home - a problem that is not a likely to be taken care of in such short notice. Despite all efforts by Sam and his parents to get the money, they do not succeed. However, Papi and Chloe think that they can save the day, and, with the help of Delgado and Pedro, two buddies of the old days, we are in for a lot of fun, including a shot at the prestigious Beverly Hills Dog Show. Well, you can imagine the rest.

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2"" is pure Disney entertainment, and you are always happy at the end of the movie. It has a magic of its own and it is a true delight. In the end, we learn that ""love is like catching your tail: spinning and spinning..."" The superb Blu-ray & DVD combo also includes interactive games, bloopers, music videos, and more. Released February 1, 2011. (USA, 2011, color, 84 min plus additional materials)

4255358,4,B0043CT8KO,"My 5 year old was very excited to see this sequel. I agree It wasn't as good as the first one but still wouldn't have missed seeing it. I purchased it with the $10 off coupon from Disney, which gave me a total of $15 for the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo pack, worth it in my book. Great family story that teaches some good lessons.",1296950400,,320,4.095238095238095
4255359,3,B0043CT8KO,"If you saw the first Beverly Hills Chihuahua movie, you'll have a good idea what to expect in this straight to DVD sequel. Cute dogs, silly antics, an outrageous plot, and did we mention cute dogs? Lead pooches Papi and Chloe have just gotten married and soon have a brood of five little pups to keep them on their toenails. Dad Papi (voiced perfectly once again by George Lopez) takes it all in stride and every night, with the best of intentions, tells his little ones stories of the Chihuahua warriors of long ago. The only problem is the puppies take the stories literally and get into all sorts of mischief. Poor Papi ends up in the dog house more than once for filling the puppies' heads with grand ideas.

But it's not the dogs that need saving this time around. The parents of Papi's owner Sam are about to be evicted from their beloved home. After several attempts to make things right with the bank, it's not looking good. But when a pack of determined Chihuahuas is on your side, how can you lose?

With the original grossing almost 95 million in 2008, it was at first surprising to see the sequel going straight to DVD. But with little of the same star power attached, it makes sense. At least Papi kept his original voice. Chloe and Delgado did not, though it's not too distracting as their new voices are similar enough. However, it was disappointing to see no human actors reprise their roles from the first film. Susan Blakely takes over for Jamie Lee Curtis as Aunt Viv, but she only appears briefly in one or two scenes. Most of the human acting was actually rather wooden, but there were a few supporting characters who made things interesting, namely Elaine Hendrix as the owner of a snotty French Poodle and the cat loving bank clerk. Also, Morgan Fairchild does justice to a dog show commentator alongside French Stewart.

The best part of the movie was seeing cool German Shepherd Delgado again. The subplot involving his two estranged police dog sons was a nod to every melodramatic father/son movie ever made, but it actually worked here and was a touching addition.

All in all, if you enjoyed the first installment you'll probably enjoy Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2, especially if you're a dog lover or a kid. It's clean entertainment with a good message about love and family. Just don't expect too much, and you'll have an enjoyable family movie night.

4255360,1,B0043CT8KO,"Once again Disney makes a movie that will doom thousands of dogs to a life of misery and even death.  They were begged by the national Dalmation and Siberian Husky clubs to include disclaimers before ""Snow Dogs"" and ""102 Dalmations"" and Disney refused.  Instead, impulsive movie goers went out and bought cute spotted and masked puppies only to ditch them when things didn't work out.  Shelters and rescues all over the country were left dealing w/ a serious surplus of Chihuahuas after the first ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" movie.  Now Disney is not only making a sequel to the worst movie to ever happen to Chihuahuas but they are promoting irresponsible breeding, as the two poorly bred Chihuahuas that star in the movie now have a litter of puppies.  I'm sure Disney left out any mention of health testing or the fact that a risky C-section would be neccessary for such small dog to deliver such a large litter.  And let's not forget that Disney completely misrepresents the sport of dog showing.  Instead of presenting a lot of dedicated, middle class dog lovers traveling all over the country to have their dogs evaluated by the best, the show in the movie is for snotty people and the winner is determined by the dogs hair and the handler's outfit.  Once again the Poodle becomes fodder for mean, ignorant jokes.  Never mind the fact that Poodles are one of few truly hypoallergenic breeds, versatile and incredibly intelligent.  I'm ""doodle"" breeders all over the country are thrilled w/ the thought of ignorant puppy buyers swarming their way b/c they don't want a snobby Poodle like the one in this movie.  I guess as a Poodle fancier I should prefer that to the breed being embraced by Disney.  I can't for the life of me imagine why Disney continues to throw dogs, and now the breeders who actually take their passion seriously, under the bus.",1296864000,2,1853,4.75625
