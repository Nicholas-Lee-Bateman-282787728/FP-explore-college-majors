3522252,5,B001D261SY,"I have enjoyed Kelsie as the lead in the kettlebell workout as well as the kickboxing workout.  She is great again in this workout, although her cueing at times is a little off.  Kelsie is full of energy and very motivating.  I love the fact that you don't need to use any of the Firm gadgets.  You just need weights.  I tried to go heavier on some weights, but I mainly used 5's.  My arms would get too tired.  I really think that this workout is a tough one.  I was at the point where I wasn't sure if I could do any more, when Kelsie started doing core work.  This workout is well worth the money.",1228435200,11,600,4.05982905982906
3522253,5,B001D261SY,"I like this DVD.  It is a full hour and according to my heart rate monitor, I did burn over 500 calories, so it does live up to it's claim in my instance.  We have to remember that the number of calories burned depends on a number of factors including your weight,resting heart rate, conditioning, etc.  There are a lot of factors, so if your heart rate monitor does not max out at the 500, it may be because you are smaller, or more fit than the average exerciser.
That said, this DVD does hit all the major ( and some minor)  muscle groups.  You will need weights.  Unlike the other Firm DVD's there is only one set of weights used on the program, but I switched out to heavier weights for the leg work. I especially like the standing ab work section.  For some reason, I prefer these to on the ground sit-ups.
I did find that the timing was off on some of the routines and it seemed that the instructors cueing was a bit behind sometimes, but not enough to take a star off.  I did the whole routine and felt like, from the start, I was getting a good workout with no stops.
I'll use it again.",1228348800,76,1095,4.156398104265403
3522254,4,B001D261SY,"I am a big fan of Kelsie Daniels' workouts, and I hope that The Firm/Gaiam puts her into regular rotation for upcoming workouts.  She's an upbeat instructor, and her moves are innovative, challenging, and really fun.  With that being said, once again, the music in this workout is just enough out of sync to be a distraction, during the cardio sections.  It's not such an issue during the sculpt sections or during the abs section at the end, but it definitely is for the cardio.  And it's a real shame, because they use some good music during this workout.

As for the title, ""500 Calories,"" I wear a heart rate monitor for all the workouts I do.  I actually burned 457 calories during this workout, for the first time, and I admit that I did ground some moves and follow the beginner modification for a little bit.  I have no doubt that if one were to keep up with Kelsie, 500 calories could be torched during this workout.",1228348800,5,925,4.470238095238095
3522255,3,B001D261SY,"While I generally liked the strength and cardio routines on this new workout, the music is often annoyingly out of sinc with the rhythms of the movements.  While it could be that the music was added in a very sloppy edit after the fact, I am certain that the instructer herself jumped off tempo several times, even occasionally skipping over a half a beat here and there...just enough to trip up the defenseless exercisor at home.  I almost quit a couple of times out of frustration, but never quite gave up.  Honestly, this would be a 5 star review were it not for this sub-standard element.",1228348800,6,592,4.566037735849057
3522256,4,B001D261SY,"First let me start off by saying...I love the fIRM. LOVE IT!! That being said, I must say that I am the biggest fan of firm circa 2004...i.e. Cardio Sculpt, Body Sculpt, Aerobic Weight Training, etc...anything with  a fanny lifter. This workout was the first i have done w/o the fanny lifter and w/kelsie. I was pleasantly surprised! No Jari Love, but not bad...although i find the ""500 calorie"" claim a bit ambitious. I was sweaty, but didn't feel i had burned that much. All in all, a good combination of strength/cardio. HOWEVER...i find some of the upper/lower body combinations a bit odd...mostly, the weight adjustment. I find myself wanting to use heavier so i can get good lower-body burn, but then they end up being too heavy for proper upper-body form. And I'm pretty strong upper body. Overall, i used 5-8 pounders on this workout...and i usually use 10-20 lbs in others. So...take it with a grain of salt. I liked it, but found the title ambitiuos, and prefer the older fanny-lifter firms.",1228176000,2,1001,4.752873563218391
3522257,5,B001D261SY,"I have been doing the Firm workouts since 2000-01 and this is an amazing workout. At first the movements seemed off the beat of the music, but then improved. The workout promises a 500 calorie burn workout in an hour and according to my monitor...I burned 618!!! That is amazing for a workout on DVD. I was so excited to try it out first thing...you won't be disappointed!!",1228176000,31,373,4.5

3522269,4,B001D261SY,"Good workout.  The hard part is that Kelsie's movements are just a fraction off from the music for me.  She also doesn't give very good cues about what is coming next.  I also found the lower body movements harder to follow because all of the shoes and pants just blend into the dark floor.  I would recommend watching it all the way through before attempting.  Like with most workouts, you memorize stuff after a few times.  For me personally, I also found that it was harder to modify the workout to accommodate my right arm.  I shattered my elbow several years ago and have a steel rod and pins that make some moves more difficult.  I can't totally straighten that arm.  All of the other Firm workouts I've done have been more forgiving in that area.  I can say that Kelsie is extremely upbeat and it's kind of contagious.  She definitely communicates high energy.",1469750400,,867,4.564935064935065

3522271,5,B001D261SY,"This is a fun and effective workout, and is a great addition to my other FIRM videos. I usually prefer the FIRM workouts that use the step (fanny lifter,) but this one is my favorite of the ones that do not require the step. No matter your fitness level, it is a fantastic workout, and you will FEEL it!
I have worked out to FIRM videos my whole life. As a toddler I attempted the exercises in my playpen, trying to follow along with my sister to the 1984 version with Susan in a yellow leotard on VHS!

 The FIRM videos are a fun, challenging, and upbeat way to maintain muscle, burn fat, and get a great cardio workout, all in less than an hour per day. The instructors are clear, and tell you what to do immediately before doing it. Kelsie, the instructor, and the people behind her are easy to follow. Obviously the first time you do a new video it is challenging to keep up to the quickly-paced routine, but after a few times, it is easy to keep up and the pace is appreciated. I hate working out to videos that take too much time explaining, and take time away from actual exercising. The 500 Cal Workout does a great job having you work out the entire length of the video. This is a great exercise routine even for those who are already fit. Those who are just beginning will enjoy it as well, and can always pause it to march in place and catch their breath. I would recommend alternating this with other videos, and not doing the same video every day.
 I suffer from plantar fasciitis, and am extremely thankful to have the Frim DVDs, to exercise with low impact. If you have or can buy a step or Fanny Lifter, my all-time favorites are The Firm Body Sculpting System DVD, which has two great hour-long workouts plus a fantastic ab workout, and my 20-year companion, The Firm - Body Sculpting System 2 4-Pack (less than 8 dollars on Amazon, if you can believe it)
Thank you for another great workout! Highly recommend this fun and effective routine.",1469404800,5,1958,4.373626373626373
3522272,5,B001D261SY,Wonderful just like the last set I ordered great for weight loss. With the firm you get the results that they promise. Kelsie Daniels is great motivator!,1465862400,,153,4.703703703703703
3522273,5,B001D261SY,Love this dvd.  Great workout,1463875200,,29,4.8
3522274,5,B001D261SY,The choreography is a little tricky the first couple times through but once you get it down its a very efficient workout. I like that it's a whole hour and the time goes by fast because she keeps you moving. I wouldn't recommend this for beginners because it is tough and fast paced. I am a big fan of the firm method.,1461801600,,318,4.145161290322581
3522275,5,B001D261SY,"Great for days when I have lots of time to work out.  Her steps are not too complex.  It took me about 2 or 3 times before I had the steps down without having to watch the screen.  Most of her steps, you can just listen and know what to do.  Only noticed 1 or 2 steps where she didn't give you a heads-up to the movement.  I love that she alternates between aerobics and weights.  Gives me a total body workout while keeping my heart rate soaring. I wish that this video gave you the option to choose segments versus doing the entire 60 minutes.  But all in all, I'd definitely recommend this video.",1461456000,,599,4.156521739130435
3522276,5,B001D261SY,"All these reviews where people are put off by how quickly she moves through the exercises:  listen, you aren't going to get it all perfect the first time through, Lord knows i didn't.  Heres the thing : you have to believe you can do it and do your best. Even though i wasn't ""perfect"" i still got an amaxing workout bumbling through some of the moves. And each time you do a routine you will have built the endurance to keep up and get a bit better every time you try.  This workout FLIES BY. I know i worked very hard and i feel proud i did my best and did the whole thing. It's tough no doubt.  But I believe it will give results. I loved it and it was fun even when i was grunting through the moves.",1461369600,13,703,4.0
3522277,5,B001D261SY,"This is a hard workout!  I have been working out with the firm for more than 10 years.  I try to do this video 3x/week because it's challenging and I never get tired of it.  If I'm tired that day, I do 3 LB weights.  If I'm feeling more ambitious, I do the 5 or even 8 LB weights that day.  I am 5'10"" and 160 LBS.  According to my Polar Heart Rate Monitor, I burn between 490 and 510 calories every time.  A couple of my other favorite videos are Complete Body Sculpting (I only burn about 250 cal in 50 minutes though) and Boot Camp (about 350 in 50 min).  There is one segment where Kelsie doesn't land exactly on the beat, but I follow her movement instead of listening to the music and I do just fine, in fact, I hardly notice anymore.  Her cues are really well done.  I like that she gives advice like, ""relax your neck"" and other things that I haven't thought of as you do the exercise.  It's like having a personal trainer!  There is a mix of dance and kickboxing moves, some of which take some practice.  Overall, challenging and fun and, for me, burns 500 calories as advertised!",1460505600,7,1089,4.177884615384615
3522278,5,B001D261SY,"This DVD gives you the best workout ever. The weights are optional, but you can do without. You will start sweating within the first 10 minutes.",1460505600,,144,4.576923076923077
3522279,5,B001D261SY,"I love this DVD/workout.  I've been using it every day for over six months, and it really toned my body.  the best thing about this workout is that weight exercise is in between medium impact cardio, which makes a good break.",1459209600,,225,4.463414634146342

3522284,5,B001D261SY,"I don't know why I didn't buy this sooner!  I have a huge collection of workout DVDs from The Firm, but for some reason did not have this one until just recently. Now that I have it, its one of my favorites!  It is off beat a little from the music, but Kelsie is a great instructor and this DVD is awesome - it can be as challenging as you want it to me, just ramp up the intensity.  There are a lot of moves that other Firm DVDs do not have, but after doing this a few times, the moves come naturally and flow together...I actually find myself doing them a second before the instructor to stay with the beat of the music.  Great DVD.",1444953600,,634,4.007936507936508
3522285,2,B001D261SY,"I really like the strength training sections but the Cardio is HORRIBLE. She went so fast I couldn't keep up. I was so worried about trying to get down all the dance moves so-called cardio .

3522287,5,B001D261SY,"This is the workout DVD collection I avoid, since it kicks my butt so insanely.  Yet, I had an occasion coming up, and used it five days in a row, and my clothes fit much better even in that short amount of time.  Hard work that pays off.  As for the people who say the moves are hard to follow - yeah, maybe a little bit the first time, but you catch on fast if you pay attention, and it's fun.  Get a sweat band with this purchase, because you will need it!",1442102400,,459,3.903225806451613
3522288,5,B001D261SY,"Love this! The first time I did it, I won't lie, I wanted to throw one of my weights through the TV at Kelsie. It seems frustrating at first. But stick with it! Your feet and brain will remember the footwork and then it is easy to follow. This workout works all of your muscles and makes me sweat a ton. I have two of her dvds, and I love her instruction. She is fun and motivational, in my opinion. So, give it a chance and do not get too frustrated the first few times. This and Pump, Jump, and Jab are my favorite home workouts. They both move so quickly that you can't get bored.",1439424000,,583,4.0344827586206895
3522289,5,B001D261SY,Excellent way to get a serious workout that help you burn lots of calories & fat even while you rest and gain muscle strength too.,1434931200,,130,4.24
3522290,5,B001D261SY,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,,1486,4.427007299270073
3522291,5,B001D261SY,"This workout DVD is Excellent!! Kelsie Daniels does a great job challenging the viewer/participant.  I love the variations and the swift pace of the workout!  Kelsie is thorough and manages to tackle part of our body.  The workout is innovative and very entertaining.  I look forward to working out using this video every week!  It certainly recommend that all Firm loyalists (and even those who have never purchased or workout using the Firm), to buy this one!! This workout is worth it!!",1431820800,,489,4.914634146341464
3522292,5,B001D261SY,"I am a regular Firm workout girl. LOVE the series. This is one of my favorites. It's about 60 minutes. The routine is well-paced and the time flies. Kelsie is one of my favorite Firm girls. Her direction is clear and she keeps you motivated. You will feel this workout after the first time. I was rocking it and then about 20 minutes after the workout, I was tired. But it was a ""good"" tired. Now that I have completed it several times, I am used to it. Highly recommend this for the Firm ""regulars"". For the newbies, just take it slow and don't give up. After a few times through it, it will become easier and easier for you.",1431820800,,626,4.225
3522293,1,B001D261SY,"I felt like a dancing gorilla doing this workout-the trainer obviously drank an entire pot of coffee before filming this-she spoke and moved so fast that my brain could not catch up to my feet. After untangling my feet for the 4th time and shimmying right while they went left,I got so agitated that I hit the eject button. I'll stick with the Firm classics-now I rembember why I hated the pink Firms many years ago",1431820800,2,415,4.473684210526316

She executes all the exercises with great form and she motivates without being sickeningly sweet. There are modifications to most of the moves. The workout incorporates strength and cardio for a complete body workout.",1430956800,,362,4.950819672131147
3522295,5,B001D261SY,This is a great work out about an hour. Its like 4 intense 12 minute segments very tiring and u can pause to catch your breath a minute. Fast paced the exercises are not hard or difficult as far as style but they are hard u will work sweat and build muscle omg even the modified without weights is still challenging if u get tired and need to recoup to maintain your form.  There is one exercise where you side squat then push up and then an arm lift and back up. There is one where you are balanced on your weights u push up and then a bicep curl .. The workout is incredible it will definitely spruce up your weekly workout routines .. If you hit a plateau here u go ..,1429401600,,671,4.007462686567164

I enjoy having this in my workout rotation and while I do get winded using this DVD, there is another FIRM DVD that gives me a much better aerobic workout - The FIRM Cross Trainers Super Cardio with Dale Brabham, Allie Strickland, Carissa Foster, and Jennifer Carman.  Consider adding this to your workout library, too! Switch out the small step for the blue segment of your Fannie Lifter and you're good to go.

3522301,5,B001D261SY,"This is a great workout. I really do burn close to 500 calories, and unlike other intense workouts, I don't feel I suffer too much with this one. Its pace is fast, things keep changing, and you need to focus on the what you are doing in order to keep up. So it's fun and not too boring. The workout goes pretty much over all muscle groups, and there is a lot of cardio, so I feel it's a good workout on its own, and I don't need to complement it with other things. In view of this, 1 hour is a reasonable workout length. The intensity gradually increases, and closer to the end of the workout it becomes quite hard, but then you know that it's almost over, and it's easier to push through. The only thing I didn't like is the cuing. The first couple of times I did the workout, there were many moves I couldn't get right, and it was frustrating. The moves change very fast, and the cuing is hard to follow. Even after doing this a few times, I still get some of the moves wrong. But then if you do approximately correct moves, with the same level of intensity, it probably does not matter - you still work the same muscles, and burn the same amount of calories. And it's a small price to pay for a fun workout.",1426032000,,1210,4.13135593220339

Now 4-5 years later, im trying to get back in the game, and this is most certainly not something for me. at least not at this point in my life. The video is extremely hard to follow, with basically no warning that your supposed to do this or that, until its too late, I mostly found my self kinda half-assed dancing along with the video.

3522322,5,B001D261SY,"I am a long- time FIRMIE and I know that not every FIRM DVD has been good.  But, Kelsie continues to amaze me.  She is VERY fit and her routines tend to be more challenging  which is perfect for the intermediate- advanced.  I would not say that this DVD is a good starting place for beginners.
I don't have a heart monitor so cant speak to the calorie burn-  but it was a good SOLID workout.  Even after one run through-  I can tell this is going to be a favorite!  A couple of notes:

CUING:  I have seen lots of complaints about her cuing.  There are a few times where she is late on the cue-  but the sequences are simple and repetitive enough that even if you miss the first go-round,  youll have the chance to try it again.  Besides, it needs to be varied enough that you don't get bored by the 5th time through!  Kelsie is actually pretty clear on her instructions.  You might try her other tape-  Pump, Jump and Jab-  it is shorter and not as fast moving.

WEIGHTS:  There are a few times where Kelsie suggests medium- heavy weights.  I would advise against it.  This workout is much more cardio-focused than sculpting focused.  I would keep the weights to whatever you consider your cardio weight.  For me (experienced exerciser)-  that is 5 lbs.
Anything more than that could increase your risk of injury because of all the fast arm movements.  Heavy up on some of the other FIRM sculpting DVDs where you can slow down and focus on the muscle.

LUNGES :  Kelsie usually is heavy on the lunges-  but this time she seemed to favor dips.  Whew!  These are easier on the knees.  However, do be careful when doing the twisting lunges  keep your feet under you and take a shorter stride until you are comfortable with the move.

Overall-  this workout has become one of the first ones I reach for.  It was a good mix of cardio and cardio-weight training (signature FIRM!) that delivers a good sweat!  Highly recommended.",1399334400,4,1923,4.406876790830945

I love how they have the beginner without weights and you can just work up from there. I use anywhere from 3 to 10lb weights depending on the specific exercise. Now I literally just skip over the cardio because even though I have had this for almost five years, I have been turned off by how The Firm delivers their cardio cues.

3522335,5,B001D261SY,"Honestly- I love this workout.  I own 4 copies gave one to my sister.  I got the extras in case I wear out the first one.  I have been doing this for several months now.  I did the first time through without weights then moved to 5lb weights for a couple of sessions, then moved to 10 pounds and have been there ever since.

This is not an easy workout.  It is high intermediate bordering on advanced.  My niece and my sister both had the same reaction to Kelsey: Shes trying to kill me!  My niece is 17 and teaches cheerleading to young girls, my sister is a dancer and in the National Guard.  They both dance but the moves on the cardio part, especially the first 3 sections, were a little complex even for them.  My sister remarked that it made her feel a bit uncoordinated the first time.  However, by the 2nd or 3rd time I had it down but admittedly we each have a good sense of rhythm.  (I do not find that Kelsey is ever off the beat like some others have said in fact we grabbed onto that cardio section the fastest, so maybe it just depends on an individuals own sense of rhythm.) It is that complexity that I like.  When I do other workouts that are based on repetition, I throw on my headphones and listen to something else because I get bored.  Those workouts like Biggest Loser, Jillian Michaels, and Leslie Sansone are great, but the workouts don't really force me to focus on what I am doing.  I cannot throw headphones on with this one because I have to concentrate on what I am doing which lends to an increased intensity level.

This DVD starts with a cardio warm up and then moves to a muscle toning section.  It goes back and forth between cardio and muscle toning in about 5 minute increments for about 50 minutes and then ends with a section for ab work and then a cool down.  If you are rhythmically challenged, skip this one or use this one only for the muscle toning portion.  (Or maybe start out with The Firms Punch, Jump, 'N Jab which is about half as long and has less complicated cardio footwork since it is based on kickboxing.)

At one point in my weight loss quest I started working out for two hours a day.  I did Jillian Michaels 30 day shred, the Pray Fit challenge, Biggest Loser Cardio Max, 10 Minute Solution Kettle Bell Fat Burner, The Firms Punch, Jump, & Jab, and Leslie Sansones 5 mile fat burning walk, and her 4 fast miles.  These are all excellent workouts, but I usually would combine at least two of  them.  There is no need to combine anything with the 500 Calorie Burn.  No add-ons needed.  I felt like when I finished this that I had accomplished something (same feeling I had when I would do the entire 30 Day shred DVD instead of just one section).  I lost 50 pounds in 4 months.

So now I am starting slow with the 15 pound weights on Leslies 30 day Walk it off DVD (always a great introduction).  And once acclimated, I plan to start using the 15 pounds on this and other workouts so I can keep building muscle, the key to fat burning.",1384819200,2,2990,4.261101243339254

3522337,4,B001D261SY,"If you had asked me yesterday what my favorite Firm workout was, I'd have said this one, ""The 500 Calorie Workout"" with Kelsie.  That's still true, but after having gone over it carefully yesterday, prior to writing this review, I will admit that I can see why some people don't care for it.

First, who do I think is going to be the most likely to see a benefit from this workout?  I'd list two primary qualifications.  (1) Someone who has done at least one or two other Firm DVDs before and is thus familiar with the vocabulary and some of the moves.  (2) Someone who is a reasonably advanced exerciser.

What you get with this DVD is a workout that's approximately one hour long.  You start with a warm up that includes a bit of cardio work, then you alternate between weights and cardio for awhile, ending with a strength segment that starts with standing ab work; this then moves down to the floor where you do some additional upper body work and a few more abdominal exercises.  If you count the warm-up, you get 5 cardio and 5 weights segments standing up, plus the standing abs/floor work strength segment, then a cool-down stretch.  Each segment is fairly short; many are in the 5-7 minute range.  I happen to like this because, if there's one section you don't like, it's over quickly.

Each cardio section and each weights section are different; the combinations are not repeated.  You'll see a bit of kickboxing, a bit of dance, and a fair number of movements that don't fit so neatly into a category (though you might call them ""aerobics"").

You do need weights for this workout.  Although you can start without weights if you need to, you'll have more of a challenge if you do use weights.  I stick with 5-8 pound weights, but 2-3 would work if you're not as advanced.  You may want to have more than one set of weights, as some exercises are more difficult than others.

Pros:

*I think the sections with weights are very good.  I particularly like that many of the moves with weights are compound movements using two or more major muscle groups (often one upper body and one lower body).  These moves take balance and coordination and help to improve core strength.

*One participant performs modified moves.  Unlike some other exercise DVDs I've experienced lately, this woman is on screen enough -- at the appropriate times -- for you to actually see what she's doing and to follow her, if that's what you need.

*I find that the participants in the background have practiced enough that their moves are basically in unison with Kelsie's.  (There's no one struggling along, half a step behind, as in some other DVDs I've done/reviewed lately.)

*The warm-up is long enough to warm up your muscles for a bit *before* stretching.  Based on everything I've heard lately, this is what fitness professionals have been advising for some time.

*The cool-down stretch is also fairly long, and you stretch all the major muscle groups (some more than one time, using different moves).  You don't feel cheated when you're done with this.

*The length of the workout in general is something I like.  I've noticed a trend the past few years to shorten workouts and shorten them again, until you're doing maybe 30 minutes of work.  I like that this one's an hour.  I just feel I get so much more benefit from a longer workout than from a shorter one.

*Kelsie has what I would call an ""athletic"" build.  She has muscle definition in her upper arms, for example, but she doesn't look like a bodybuilder.  To me, anyway, she looks like a healthy, fit woman, which is really the whole point.  She's believable as a workout leader.

Neutral/Ambivalent:

People are going to be of two minds about the cueing/instructional time.  Being somewhat familiar with other Firm DVDs before trying this one, I'll honestly admit to not noticing how fast the instructional segments were.  I might've struggled the first couple of times I tried this DVD; I really don't remember.  But after doing this workout two or three times, I pretty much felt like I had the moves down.  What generally happens is that you start out doing one move, then add on another and another until you've got an entire sequence built up.  Then, you perform the sequence a handful of times on both sides of the body.  I will agree with the other reviewers that yes, Kelsie's instruction is pretty fast, and she definitely uses a lot of Firm-specific vocabulary.  You may very well find yourself stumbling around for a bit, especially the first few times you try this workout.  I know I did.

At any rate, I did get to the point where I could follow along easily, and was grateful that the instructions building up to the combinations were relatively short.  I can see, however, why some people might not care for that, why they might want longer and/or slower build-ups to combinations.  So please consider your own skill level and preferences here.

For what it's worth, I don't know how many calories I actually burn during this workout because I don't have a heart rate monitor.  I do feel like this is the most difficult Firm workout for me to complete (of the ones I've tried).

Note that there's not a lot of discussion of good form.  However, I felt that all the participants demonstrated good form (e.g., knees not going over toes during squats, backs not bowed during push-ups, etc.).  Because there are several weightlifting segments, you will not want to do this workout every day; give the muscle groups you use during this DVD at least a day to rest before working them again.

Cons:

*I find the music annoying.  It's electronic/manufactured and mostly played on endless loop, though it does change from workout segment to workout segment.

*The camera angle changes for no apparent reason.  (However, you *can* see every move being performed, and there are no odd zooms as I have seen with some other workout DVDs.)

*Some moves are difficult, even for me.  ""Jazz boxes"" definitely fall into this category.  To this day, I still can't do one properly.  There may be other moves that throw other people off.  If you are not coordinated, it will take you a much longer time to figure all of this out, especially in view of what I wrote in the ""neutral"" section above.  (""Practice makes perfect"" may not exactly be true here, but practice certainly does lead to improvement.)

On balance, I find this to be a challenging workout.  It's also one of my favorites from the Firm.",1383523200,,6451,4.6705150976909415

3522355,5,B001D261SY,"This workout claims to make you burn up to 500 calories.  I burn no less than 470 calories each time I do this workout according to my heart rate/calorie counter watch.

I will admit that when I first started working out to the Firm I hated it.  The moves and routines were hard to follow and went way too fast. I was miserable since I am poorly coordinated.  I kept with it though because they were the only workout DVD's I had at the time (I had purchased multiple DVD's of the pink Firms at one time), and because I blamed it on my poor coordination.  I kept trying the workouts because I was determined to improve my coordination.  I would do my own weird version of the moves whenever I couldn't follow along properly and found that I still burned calories.  It took about 5 months of working out 3 times a week for me to finally follow along well.  Once I got it, I found that this is a great workout that tones while burning calories.  Now that I'm familiar with the style of the Firm I love it.  I burn lots of calories with ""The 500 Calorie Workout.""  My balance, strength, and coordination have also improved.",1358640000,,1119,4.30622009569378
3522356,1,B001D261SY,"I had purchased another DVD featuring Kelsey and I was disappointed by her awful, and lack of, cueing.  I am a Firm user since I was teenager and I continue to use their original 5 a few of the newer ones about 6 times a week. I am not a beginner by any means her cueing starts half way into the moves. Additionally, her voice is so irritating and hard to understand, I found myself putting on the mute button.

The weight workout is pretty solid and has some unique moves but I hated the dancey marching segments that was endless and boring.

Here are the pro's and cons:

Pro's:
- Weighted work out was challenging and added some new moves that really worked my glutes and legs
- Weighted workout segment really got the heart pumping  - great cardio

Con's:
- Instructor's cueing was delayed and her speech hard to understand and a huge turn off
- The dancey part in between the weighted work out is BORING and too long",1356307200,2,921,4.325581395348837
3522357,2,B001D261SY,"Like others said, I really wanted to love this workout.  I tried it at least 4 times and the last time I decided it just wasn't good enough to waste my time with.  I exercise about 6 days per week, sometimes 2x per day with Jillian Michaels, Billy Blanks, Denise Austin, Shaun T, other FIRM dvds, etc. and they are better.  I felt like the weights were too light for me to burn calories, but yet she was moving too fast for me to be able to use heavier weights or switch to heavier weights when I felt like I needed to.  The cardio parts where she didn't use weights were good, but I still didn't feel like they were enough to burn a lot of calories and you need a lot of space to move around, which I don't have at home!  I also purchased Calorie Explosion from the FIRM, so I'm going to try that one and see if it's better.

With all this said, I probably shed a couple of pounds adding this to my weekly routine, but it wasn't enjoyable enough or hard enough for me to keep doing it and a couple of pounds is probably all I will lose with this, while with Jillian I think I lost 10!!",1355097600,,1086,4.027906976744186
3522358,2,B001D261SY,steps of this video are complicated it is hard to follow. I only played it onced for about 15-20 mins.,1350172800,2,102,4.15
3522359,5,B001D261SY,"Out of all the newer Pink Firms, I actually enjoy this one the most. It packs in SO MUCH, yet everything just flows perfectly for some reason. Probably because I'm not a huge fan of workouts where you are on the floor alternating burpees and planks then jumping back up to do more high cardio. (They work, but I like doing a workout all one way). The only segment I do not like for some reason is when she suddenly does this part where you do side lunges with no weights and then go down for a ""bootcamp"" with pushups. I just do something else during that small section. To me for some reason I just don't like doing those. But the music and moves I REALLY LOVE! Basic, easy, and not too repetitive. The cardios are speced into 4 small segments alternating with light weight moves. A GREAT Circut type workout. She is very motivating, and this workout just flys by. I'm not sure if it really burns 500 calories (maybe for overweight beginners), but usually the smaller you begin to get after awhile, the harder it is to lose because you have to workout much harder or cut your calories even more. But I won't underestimate that this workout burns at LEAST 300 calories. ;) I also like that this workout is a lot longer than most of the Pink FIRMS since the newer ones just seemed like they got more shorter in time, and too easy. This one brings back the way the FIRM used to be (when the FIRMS were ran by Anna Benson and had the class and mirror stage-THOSE were more challanging which is why I STILL use those and own almost every single one of them-and still collecting!) LOL

Overall, for the newer ones this one is surely a keeper. :)",1347148800,,1640,4.324675324675325
3522360,5,B001D261SY,"I have been a big fan of The Firm for years, but mostly purchased videos in their sets.  Recently I received a gift card and was anxious to purchase some more Firm videos, this was one of them.  I read the reviews carefully and was worried that I would not ""get"" it at first, but I was wrong.  Kelsey (my first experience with her) does each move enough times and tells you what moves to add with enough notice, so that by the end of set I was moving with them!  Yes, there are some stumbles; some moves I had never seen before, but overall these were really fun moves and very different from other videos I've done from The Firm.

The video is 60 minutes long, which is definitely one of the longest I own now, but I didn't get bored and wasn't staring at my clock the whole time.  I just kept having more and more fun as the video went on!  Very sweaty too!

I wear a HRM when exercising, so I can easily say that this video lives up to its name.  Last night was only my second time completing, and that was without weights so that I could get the hang of it, and I easily went over 500 calories.  I can't wait to see what I'll burn when using weights!  Kelsey may also be my new favorite instructor, although I love them all!

Overall an awesome video that I'm incorporating into my collection.  I'm a SAH and WAH mom with two kids under the ages of 4, with a busy husband who works a lot, so I more than appreciate The Firm for helping me have these awesome workouts at home for such great prices.",1341360000,,1501,4.116838487972508
3522361,5,B001D261SY,This workout left me dripping with sweat from head to toe.  It starts off deceptively moderate but as soon as you pick up those weights you start to feel the sweat coming.

3522362,5,B001D261SY,"I think it's hard to read a review of an exercise video and know if it's right for you. Everyone's needs and abilities are so different. I've been exercising 5-7 days a week for the last three months slowly working my way up in 10 min increments beginning with just 10 min. that first day. I'm up to 45 minutes easy with a 60 minute workout feeling kind of long. I ordered this video knowing it was probably going to be above my comfort zone both in time and ability. I first tried this video on 5/4. I lasted 40 minutes. I was tired both physically from moves I wasn't used to and mentally from trying to keep up. I felt Kelsie talked too fast and switched moves too fast. I was determined though, and tried the video again on 5/6. I was able to complete the whole 60 minutes but lost my way on some of the moves. I used this video again this morning, 5/13. I was able to complete it and keep up with the moves much, much better! This video has proved to me that I'm much stronger than I thought I was, that it's okay to start out slow, and that it's okay to revise moves to your ability and still get a good workout. I liked Kelsie's reminders to keep your shoulders back as I tend to tense up. I like that you only need two different sets of dumbbells and she includes a really great stretching segment at the end. I'm happy with this purchase and will use it often. Good luck to you all in your efforts to get/stay fit!",1336867200,2,1423,4.122302158273381
3522363,3,B001D261SY,"I was excited to try this workout because I usually love Firm DVDs. I exercise at least five times a week, usually with a blend of cardio and weights. This workout seemed to fit that bill perfectly. Five minutes into the workout, I was excited by my increased heart rate, and I thought it would be a great addition to my schedule.

Unfortunately, the instructor's lack of direction quickly frustrated me. She would give a two-word cue, then begin the move without any instruction in form or execution. By the half-way point, my feet were tangled up, and my heart rate was rising only in frustration. Maybe if I were more familiar with step aerobics terms, I would've done better, but this style of workout just isn't for me. Looks like a trade-in is coming soon.",1335225600,,762,4.602941176470588
3522364,5,B001D261SY,"This is a fantastic workout -- a fast fun sweatfest.

I've been doing Firm workouts since the late 90's, and this is one of the best.  I must admit that I had some trouble adjusting to these new workouts initially; they were hard on my sciatic nerve, and I didn't think there was any real substitute for leg press on the box, but I'm getting over all of that.  I've almost completely stopped rotating the old step box workouts.

However, as others have mentioned, there are music/timing issues.  I don't know if it's Kelsie or some problem with production.  It doesn't matter; they should have fixed it before they released it.  There is no reason why they could not have synced the music in post so that it is in time with the video.

There don't seem to be any issues like this with any of the workouts by Allie and Allison, but there are two other workouts with Emily Welch that have the same problem, so I think it's post-production, not the instructors.  If it is the instructors, then the directors should have caught it.

But never mind.  This workout is so good that the slight confusion doesn't really impinge on its overall effect.",1335139200,,1141,4.517073170731707

It's also very effective, I feel the burn while I'm doing the workout and I feel the soreness for a couple days afterwards. I was not able to complete the entire 60min workout the first time, but I gradually built up to it and now I can do the entire workout and have a good sweaty challenging workout. I'm an intermediate exerciser so this was perfect for me.",1334448000,3,558,4.427184466019417
3522366,5,B001D261SY,Wow! What a workout!  I have been working out with the Firm for over a year now.  This is the first time I have worked out with Kelsie and I have to say that this could be my favorite Firm workout yet!  That speaks volumes because I absolutely love the other DVD's I have purchased from the Firm.  What I like about the 500 Calorie Workout is that it combines many moves I have done in the other DVD's and new moves for a nice challenge.  Kelsie creates a nice blend of cardio intervals and weight intervals.  Each interval goes by so fast and transitions smoothly into the next! It is hard to get bored because you are switching between cardio and weights. I don't know how many calories I burned; however; I was drenched in sweat by the end of the workout. I have to say I feel like I got an excellent workout.  This is a fast-paced DVD so if you are new to the Firm I would suggest not beginning with this workout as you might find it challenging to pick up the moves.  I began with Cardio Party also by the Firm as my first Firm DVD. I feel Cardio Party would be a great prerequisite for the 500 Calorie Workout.  The reason being several moves you see in Kelsie's DVD are moves that are introduced in Cardio Party at a lower intensity.  Kelsie's DVD is a terrific DVD to do when you want to increase your workout intensity and your fitness level.  If you pick up the pace quickly or are a person who has been working out for a while than I definitely suggest immediately adding Kelsie's 500 Calorie Workout to your fitness regime!,1330387200,3,1535,4.258620689655173
3522367,1,B001D261SY,"I have several Firm dvds that I enjoy doing weekly, mostly with instructor Allison Davis. I bought the 500 Calorie workout because I liked the idea of a hard, calorie-burning hour of cardio. My advice, save your money and the hour of your time you will spend trying to follow this erratic instructor. As others have reported, the cuing is horrendous and the disconnect of the workout to the music is a huge distraction. Kelsie is hands-down the poorest instructor I've ever seen on a workout dvd in terms of direction and preparing you for the next move. Even the background gals look as if they are stuggling to follow her. After three different occasions of giving the workout a shot and then turning it off and hitting the treadmill instead, I decided that there are many less frustrating and more enjoyable ways to burn 500 calories.

I love the video because the strength exercises are inter-mixed with the cardio sessions.  Just when I feel I can't continue, Kelsie moves on to the next session.  The workout program I formerly used did intense cardio upfront, then ended with strength exercises at the end.  It was sometimes difficult to properly do the strength exercises if I was too tired from cardio portion.  Kelsie adds a variety of movements, so the workout isn't boring.  The hour goes by really fast!  I use this video to workout between the days that I go running.  I've been doing my previous work cardio/strength workout for 3 years and started to plateau.  The video promises you'll see a difference after 10 workouts, but I've notice that my arms are more toned.  I definitely recommend this video!",1318204800,3,955,4.5588235294117645

I think that you should have a little experience with FIRM workouts or even some Step class type moves before trying this DVD. I think if you don't have any background you will not be able to keep up with the cardio segments and you'll feel frustrated. The instructor, Kelsie, is in incredible shape. I definitely cannot lunge as deep as she can and that's OK because with this workout, like all FIRM workouts, you can modify it if you are a beginner and work up to deeper lunges and heavier weights. I would say I am at an intermediate level and used 5 pound weights for all of the strength training segments. That weight was definitely a push for me at certain times and I was truly exhausted after some sets, especially shoulders. I never had a workout cause me to sweat like crazy like this one does! I also feel like I can keep going and not tire out completely because they mix it up: they have cardio then strength, then cardio again, etc. As with most all FIRM workouts they combine upper and lower body to increase intensity and burn more calories. Overall it is a solid workout and a long one - approx 60 minutes. It's also an all over good workout - you get full body strength training and heart-raising cardio all in one. I like mixing my workouts up quite often so I do this one maybe 3 or 4 times a month and mix it in with the rest of my FIRM DVDs. I really do love this workout.",1314576000,,1479,4.24822695035461

I found that it had some good moves but some segments were done so quick it was hard to catch onto what she was doing. I also found that some of the transitioning between weights and non weights was too quick. I actually strained my left back muscles doing this workout and that has never happened with any of the harder programs. I like changing things up and will do this occasionally but not as often as some of my other programs. Just wasn't impressed by it.",1312502400,,617,4.282051282051282
3522375,4,B001D261SY,"I totally agree with the other reviewers about this video not being as good as some of the other Firm dvds.  Yes, Kelsie is not good at cuing the moves, she moves too fast and she does not coordinate her workout to the music. All of these things will mess up your learning curve whether you are new to the Firm or a familiar follower like me.  This just goes to show that being a good fitness instructor is a skill and Kelsie sure could use more practice.

It took me 5 workouts to get the moves down.  But once I did, it was totally worth it.  The workout is a great one!!  After 5 workouts I have blasted through a fitness plateau that I had been going through for about a month.  The strength training sequences and the kick-butt abs are my favorite.

The cardio sequences are where you will have the most trouble following along and this is probably the reason why alot of people who bought this dvd don't like it.  I can't say I blame them.  However, just like anything else new you try, you have to give yourself a chance to learn it. You really have to ask yourself how much of your time is worth learning it.

I have everything from Insanity (which I would advise for anyone looking to burn 500 calories) to P90X to Tae Bo to the Firm.  I have many Firm dvds.  None of them give me anything approaching the aggravation of this video.
I absolutely am frustrated out of my mind with the cueing on this video.  I don't care how many times I try, I can't follow Kelsie's (the instructor) cardio cueing.  Now, I don't take to a video immediately; I expect some sort of a learning curve.  There is no curve with this.  First, as many reviews have noted, Kelsie cues in Firm lingo.  I didn't think that would be a problem, given how many Firm dvds I own.  But I get it now - she's cueing you for multiple moves, using Firm lingo for absolutely everything.  So while you're translating what she says into lunge, glute-hamstring lift then squat, she's moved onto another sequence.  Second, again well-noted by others, the music/beat is off so many times, it is distracting beyond disbelief.  Again, I thought I would be okay since other reviewers also acknowledged that they got passed that.  Well, God bless you, my friends!!  You are the lucky ones!
I did give this two stars simply because I do find a redeeming quality in the weighted sequences.  The video has both weights and cardio segments.  I could do all of the weight moves successfully the first time, and I will point out that these are tried and true moves to shape and tone your body.  Still, it doesn't help my overall review too much because the cueing is equally as bad here.  It's just a lot easier to process the cueing lingo during the weighted moves, where you're necessarily moving slower than you would during cardio.  Plus, if you've worked out even a little, you've probably done these moves before, so it's much easier to catch on.  That said it stays in the 2-star category because no one should ever have to work so hard to work out.  You want your workout to be tough, not the instruction.",1297555200,,2106,4.530503978779841

It's very hard to follow when there's no relation from the steps to the music.  The cues are also too late to figure out what's next.  I'm sure that won't be a problem after I go through the DVD a few more times. I did get a good workout though!!!!!!

The moves are tricky at first but with practice you do get the hang of it. And yes you do burn about 500 calories depending on the weights you use. The workout last about 65 mins and you are in constant motion. My advice for beginners and those who have not exercised in while start, with the modified movements as all firm videos advice then build up. Since this is a new workout for me and I haven't worked out in a while I did the workout in 3 sections. I divided each section into 20 min segments or right before the cardio movements. This way I was able to get through the whole workout. Eventually you can increase the time, until your able to do the whole workout.

3522390,5,B001D261SY,"I started this workout dvd and saw quick results. First, I began to see changes in the 10 workouts being more toned. After the first month, then my back, hips and arms were looking smaller yet I could feel the strength and new muscles in my body. Right now I am in month 2 and will be letting you know more about my progress. I started with the lightest weights 3lbs then gradually built up to 4lbs and now use 5lbs. I like the standing abs and can see the changes with this total body workout. My doctor was telling me to lose weight and I was working out on the treadmill yet the results were not there. Adding this workout dvd with weights has changed my body and I have lost inches, built up muscle, and now have defined arms. I am very happy with this dvd and recommend this dvd if you want to see results. I even sometimes mix it up so that my muscles stay confused. I might use this dvd as my main workout for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and use a lighter or body sculpting for Tuesday and Thursdays. I say try this dvd if you want to see more results than using the treadmill or outdoor walking. I think that the reason this dvd works is due to the intervals of cardio and weights.

I bought this one based on overall review.  It drove me crazy that she wasn't starting a sequence on the first beat of the typical 4-beat length of music!  When I got certified to teach, that was one thing that the instructors taught us, to start on the first beat, and switch after the fourth beat.  I try to do her moves, only on the correct beat, but it's not fun.  Would not reco.",1287100800,,492,4.041237113402062
3522392,3,B001D261SY,"I am an every day exerciser and often look for new videos to challenge my normal routine and keep my workouts fresh.  I borrowed this workout and though it was a pretty good workout I would probably not purchase it for myself.

The dvd clocks in at a bit over 60 minutes and unless you choose not to, handweights are needed for the weight training segments.  I don't use weights everday so I kept to light 3 lb. weights and these worked fine for me. I felt like I had a workable weight for me while I did the exercises so I did the moves right without sacrificing quality.

Here are my pros and cons:

Pros: Energetic instructor, but not over-the top annoying.  She is in good shape without being a cartoon stick figure.  Exercises are generally easy to follow. Your heart rate does increase and you work large and small muscle groups together to torch those calories and make your workout count.

Cons: Nothing really new here, I wouldn't say boring, but I can't see myself turning this to this over and over. For me to want to do it repeatedly I find I have to really like it alot and it needs to be something unique.  This wasn't it.  However, if you like lunges, pushups and the like and that is your kind of workout, you may really love this.

Overall, for me it was a good workout but didn't bring enough ""fun"" to make me turn to it again and again and for me, I know I won't stick to a workout that doesn't bring me something special.

If you are a fan of the firm series, you will probably enjoy this.  If you like calesthenics, you also might like it, but if you are looking for something unique, this is nothing new.",1285027200,,1626,4.2745098039215685

The Bad:  The instructor needs better cueing in the video.  Some of the choreography is hard to keep up with in in the beginning.  The instructor mixes up her left/right ALL the time.  This is highly irritating.  Seems like they would have taken the time to dub over her mistakes.

Overall, this DVD caused me to work up a serious sweat so I'll probably put it into my rotation.  I believe a beginner to intermediate fitness person will find it of high value and something you can work your way through.  Don't be discouraged by the beginning warm-up choreography; it gets better as you begin to complete your strength moves.",1284940800,,849,4.6938775510204085

I bought this DVD as a cardio supplement to The Wave DVD's. This DVD is horrible for various reasons. 1. NO WHERE on the DVD are there instructions or cues on how to do the moves. 2. 90% of the time, the moves are NOT done to the beat of the music (which drives me crazy) 3. The moves that are easy to catch onto are lunges. So unless you have the time to slowly go through this DVD and pause it to learn the moves before you actually can partake in the actual workout, save yourself some money and go outside and do a half hour of traveling lunges. Don't give up on The Firm all together, though. Many of their DVD's are fantastic! I think it may just be this instructor that is the issue. Rock Solid Cardio is also lead by her and it, too, is ridiculous for the same reasons. Although I am sure Kelsie Daniels is probably a sweet and wonderful woman, she seriously needs to take some lessons from Allie Del Rio on how to instruct a workout via DVD.

Yes there are lags in the music but I was happy about that as it gave me a minute to catch my breath!  Some of the lunge moves involve twisting...I have knees issues so I modified the move to keep moving.  The workout requires you to have some coordination, but I think it is worth the time to try it if you want a solid total body workout.  Also the instructor sometimes misses cues, but after doing this a few times, I can anticipate where she is going and stay on point.

There are some negative aspects ,that IMO, could make or break your decision on purchasing this.  Her cueing gets ahead of itself, which causes some confusion.  The choreography can be a little complex at times, so if coordination isn't your strong point...skip this workout. Also, if you have knee problems, definately steer clear of this.

She goes so fast that by the time I figure out what she's doing, she's on to something else.  I prefer something a little slower that focuses on form rather than coordination.  She doesn't focus much on making sure you're doing it right. I always though I had decent coordination but perhaps not!  I also find the instructor super annoying.  I can't stand the way she talks and doesn't speak in complete sentences. I feel like she's trying to prove something. After doing this 4 times I don't find it any easier to follow.

3522403,4,B001D261SY,"I have been using various Firm DVD's for about 4 years and I absolutely love them.  To date, my favorite is the 500 calorie workout.  This workout, with stretching at the end, is little over 60 minutes long, but I promise that it is a very quick 60 minutes!  The workouts are fun and challenging and if I'm not burning 500 calories in one workout, I'm sure close to it.  I've had this DVD for a few weeks and just completed my 11th workout and I have definitely seen results.  I exercise approximately 4 days a week with the 500 calorie workout being used on two of those days.  On the other two days I do another Firm DVD and I also take an aerobics class at my gym that is very similar to the 500 calorie workout.  The Firm, as with most of their workouts, incorporates cardio and strength training into their workouts, which I have learned from personal experience is the best way to tone and transform your body.  I just moved up from using 5lbs weights to using 8lbs weights, which has made a huge difference for me.  I have been using 5lbs weights for years and now that I use the heavier weights, my arms are finally more toned.  I have been an avid exerciser for the past 7 years and just this past month I was finally able to do push ups (real push ups, not on the knees push ups) and this was a huge milestone for me!  I gave this rating 4 stars, instead of 5, because Kelsi isn't the best at warning you of what's coming next and her timing is a bit off.  I am a fast learner when it comes to new workout DVD's; however, this one took a few times before I got it down, because she's not the best at giving instructions on what to do next.  That's my only complaint, though.  I highly recommend this DVD.  While it can be hard to get motivated to work out at home, do this DVD at least 10 times and see the results for yourself and I promise you will continue to what to exercise.  I am a walking advertisement for The Firm and I hope that others are able to get to where I am at.  Thank you to The Firm!",1268352000,,2014,4.096938775510204

I appreciate the quickness of the dvd but not everyone knows the moves right away so when you do the move twice and move on to the next one, you really don't get a chance to do anything at all and it just seems like a big waste of time.

3522413,5,B001D261SY,"I bought this DVD while shopping for odds and ends at a retailer. It was cheaper than I had seen it before and since I was back and forth as to get it or not, I decided to take the plunge. It is by far one of the best fitness DVD buys I have made, ever!!

This DVD has a lot of both positive and negative reviews and I have for a while been curious about this, but wasn't sure it would be for me. I have been able to work my way back up to a high intermediate fitness level after time of from surgery and illness, and I found that I actually went faster than the instructor!! Kelsie is a great lead in this DVD, my second experience with her. My first was with the Firm Wave, and I DID NOT click with her for that workout. So since I have been hesitant to purchase DVDs with her as the lead. After doing this DVD, I am now searching for her DVDs. This workout is approx 60 minutes in length and it moves you quickly throughout the DVD, never slowing down or breaking the choreography down.

You use dumbbells in this DVD but I would classify this as a Cardio Workout. She doesn't heavy up and uses only 1 set, sometimes using both in one hand for bicep or back work. Since the ""toning"" segments are short and quick, there isn't much rep work to consider this a decent strength workout. It does though allow you to hit both aerobic and anaerbic heart rate zones and the calorie burn is high. Since I have only done this DVD once (I've only had it for 6 days) I used 3 lbs dumbbells. This would be the perfect DVD to use weighted gloves and a belt if you have access to those. Because she moves so quickly, it is highly recommended that you have experience with the Firm workouts, mainly the Pinks as the choreography is called out by term name and there is no breakdown, only adding to it. She keeps you moving with no time so slow down. Although in between cycles/segments (every 5+ minutes) you march in place for 10-15 seconds to catch the next song's beat. A perfect amount of time for water breaks and I took those often!! I have noticed that a common complaint is that she is off of the beat and that she moves too quickly. I personally didn't notice the music all that much bc I was working so hard, I tend to tune music out once I am working at a certain intensity level. I also noticed that I was ahead of her by 1-2 beats in choreography!! She was moving fast, but apparently, I can and did move faster...often! Let's keep in mind here that I am a high intermediate, this DVD is rated for Intermediates by Fitness Forums. Again, knowing the Firm Terminology will go a long way and make the ""too fast"" pace a lot more doable on the first go round.

Dear Kelsie does a lot of high impact modifications, those with knee or back issues take notice to that. I have both. I wear a knee brace and was able to do all the moves but 1 or 2 comfortably with my knees. She does this movement that goes from a lunge into a push up, back into a lunge, then standing. That was the move my knee had problems with. I modified to a range of motion that was better for me, but it was still a little tricky, especially with a brace as it limits range of motion. There are also a couple of multi-muscle/4 limbs moves that incorporate balance (usually standing on one leg and doing a leg lift with the opposite and arm work). These were the ones that my lower back had trouble with. I think that for the average person, someone who doesn't have a history with lower back issues would be just fine. I noticed that I was slacking in the ""ab tightening"" form on these too bc I was concentrating on doing so many other things at the same time. If your core is strong and/or you can keep the focus on keeping your core tight, it'll be fine. BUYER BEWARE: If you DO NOT like lunges, do not purchase this DVD; she does them often!

I absolutely love the choreography in this one. It has a little bit of everything from mambos, to kickboxing, to traditional-retro style floor work. The variety kept me very intrigued and intuned to this DVD. The abs section at the end is a little tougher than some of the other pinks and for me, I had to follow the beginner and even do a less intense version than the beginner modifier. I like I said, have low back issues so Ab work is a ""must"" for me, but it can be a difficult task. She does a lot of movements that are working the upper and lower abs at the same time; moving the legs in/out or up/down. I found that If I kept my uppers engaged the entire time, the lower ab movements weren't as hard on my back. I still have to work up to the full range and full rep count, but it gives me something to strive for. I can't say enough how much I really loved this workout!! I even told my husband ""thank you"" at least a dozen times bc it is just so much fun! Kelsie is a great lead and her instruction/cueing is almost perfect. The pace is quick, lets not be fooled about that, but it is so doable. That is IF you are familiar with the Firm Pinks. Kelsie tends to be a ""faster"" lead from what I can tell, but this DVD is meant to challenge you. I was able to pick up the choreography the first time through, and most ppl should be able to by the 2nd or 3rd. Using 3s and 5s would make this a Cardio Knockout and high calorie burner. I lift at the gym so I don't need the strength work via DVD. This is one that you can easily grow with, upping the weights as you get stronger, adding a weight belt or gloves, and doing all high impact-there's a lot of those modification for sure!

I'd buy this DVD all over again in a heart beat no questions asked. As far as Calorie Burn, I burned over 500 and I know it'll be even higher next time. I had to stop a few times for unrelated issues, brining my heart rate down. I use a Polar F6 for those that are curious about Heart rate monitors.",1263600000,7,5799,4.110229276895944
3522414,2,B001D261SY,"There were aspects of this DVD that I thought were good but unfortunately, the negative parts outweighed the positive ones. In fairness, I did enjoy some of the moves and I did feel that the instructor, Kelsie, was trying to keep the routines interesting. It's possible that if you knew the moves well and could keep moving you would burn the advertised 500 calories. But when so much starting and stopping is involved to try to determine what's happening, you miss the opportunity to really achieve that.

My complaints:

*The moves are not explained at all.
*The pace is rapid, which is good for cardio purposes, but makes the viewer feel very confused.
*The only times I felt sure that I was engaged in proper form were the weight/toning segments.
*Most of the cardio exercises seemed to be based on lunges and about halfway through the DVD, I felt like it was becoming monotonous on top of confusing.
*Many reviewers have said they felt it was challenging but I feel like there are many other DVDs that leave this one in the dust. I didn't feel like I had been challenged enough and if you do aerobics avidly, you'll likely be disappointed.
*This is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things but I didn't like the music and didn't feel like the exercises fit well with the music.
*This has been brought up previously but the poor cueing of the video really does create the possibility for injury and definitely made me confused. I did not like the odd segmentation of the DVD whatsoever.
*Also a minor complaint but I would have liked a bar on the screen to track progress level. Having said that, considering how rapid and disjointed the DVD is, it would've been a pointless feature in this case.

I started with the Wave, which I love, and doing that workout really helped me out with this one as I was familiar with a lot of the moves.  I burnt exactly 528 calories doing this workout (I have a heartrate monitor and I'm a 172lb 5'7 female) and do a lot of the beginner modifications.  I found some of the moves challenging but I am very uncoordinated.  Even still, I caught on quick and was able to keep moving and do the moves successfully or at least some modification of them.  I used 3 lb weights, but am looking to get some 5 lb ones to use in the future.  I really enjoy this workout.  It moves quickly and keeps me from getting bored.  I feel great when I'm done and definitely feel that the workout is working because I'm sore afterwards and the next day.  I highly recommend this one!",1260662400,,842,4.245283018867925

3522420,4,B001D261SY,"A very good workout.  As others said, there are a lot of lunges.  I like that she combines a lot of moves so you really maximize your work out.  It's hard but achievable.  The only area for improvement would be the music and a little more creativity in the moves. It's not a fun workout but it is an effective.",1255737600,,310,4.116666666666666
3522421,5,B001D261SY,"I bought this DVD and popped it in, on a Sunday evening, thinking I would just 'view' it and maybe try a few steps out...NOT!  I started and couldn't stop even though I wanted to quit during a pause due to the complexity and high energy of the steps.  Kelsie is very energetic, encouraging and never stops!  I thought the music was upbeat and yes I too thought that the cuing was a bit off and lost my step a few times BUT I kept right on moving!  It takes several times watching the DVD to get the steps right (that contributes to what makes it challenging), as this is fast paced and not for beginners, but that is how it is with most new exercise DVDs where you have to get used to the routine.  Again not for BEGINNERS!  I was drenched afterwards and feeling the burn (more like having my butt kicked) but I can't wait to do this fun workout again.  If you are looking for a boring, predictable and repetitive routine with little rest breaks in between then this is definitely NOT the routine for you!  If you are looking for a challenging, unpredictable, fast-paced and fun workout then this is a great hour long workout that is a must have to add to your collection of workout rotations.",1254700800,,1193,4.318385650224215

She also mixes it up and is constantly telling you what is coming up next.  Plus, she is continuously giving you tips on form and breathing.

This workout is not for people new to exercise... She assumes you know what v-steps and other steps are called, so you might want to use other workouts first.  Then definitely give this one a go.  You are moving the whole time!

The moves seemed very fresh and fun even to me and I am quite familiar with Firm workouts.  I appreciate the interval bursts since from what I understand this is the best way to lose weight.

I am an advanced exerciser -- I run, I swim laps, and I bike and this is one of the most challenging workouts that I have done.  I really enjoy The Firm workouts -- their dvd series workouts helped me to get in great condition.  I workout 5 to 6 days a week.  I got this video b/c I wanted something new and fun.  This workout delivers both.  And it really is fun to do -- Kelsey is both motivating and energetic the entire workout.  I definitely feel that I burned some major calories with this workout.  Being an athlete, I thought that I would breeze right through this:  I didn't -- it was tough...which is a good thing!  This means it will challenge you and take you to the next level -- which is what you want!!  Don't get discouraged if you can't get all the moves right away -- the tempo is a bit different -- but you will catch on quick after a few times!!  Have fun doing this workout -- it's a blast and one you should have in your collection!",1252886400,,1006,4.102564102564102

3522427,4,B001D261SY,"I did this workout yesterday for the first time and am FEELING it today!! That is a sign of a good workout, so this one did not disappoint. I love the combination movements that she does w/ upper and lower body working together for a more complete workout that gets the blood pumping and heart rate up there. I agree w/ some of the other reviews that this is a little fast-paced and I sometimes felt that I was just mastering what was being asked of me when it was on to the next move. More repetition would be good....which is why I only give it 4 stars. It was just my first time doing it so I am sure it will be easier tomorrow! Lower weights w/ more repetition tones the body better, which is more what I am looking for. Having said that, I will definitely be putting this workout into my weekly rotation. There is a short AB segment at the end, w/ some bicycles (ugh!) and some standing abs, which I thought was a nice change from the lying down ab routines that get monotonous after awhile. I think this is definitely a good value considering all of the muscle groups that are worked! If you feel frustrated doing it the first time, don't give up. I think it will get easier over time and I really feel it will be an effective program, at least for me!",1252368000,,1258,4.202479338842975

However, the music used during the 500 Calorie Workout is dreadful, and unfortunately hard to ignore because it is set at a volume that often seems like it's trying to drown out Kelsie (the instructor).  The Firm had this problem before, most notably during the series of workouts using The Firm Box (the step that was introduced in between the Fanny Lifter and the TransFIRMer).  This time, to add insult to audio injury, not only is the music loud, Kelsie is out of sync A LOT.  I have a strong dance background - if I hear a beat, I know how to stay on it.  Kelsie's tempo is all over the place, and very hard to follow because she's usually nowhere near the tempo of the music.  This makes the workout one of the most frustrating I have ever done.  It's an effective workout, but one I'll avoid doing very often.  I can't wait to get back to the cueing and rhythm of instructors like Allie and/or Alison.",1250380800,7,1070,4.413265306122449

I couldn't keep up...not because the workout was hard but the directions and the moves were to many at one time.  I used this dvd once and haven't looked by since.  I love the idea of a 500 calorie burn workout in one but I just don't get it.,1250208000,6,370,3.8933333333333335

It's a tough workout if you can get in your own groove but I find myself using this the least of all the Firms workouts.",1248739200,2,423,3.8735632183908044

Kelsie does not explain what she is doing and moves from movement to movement under the assumption that you know what her terminology means. I HATED this dvd and would not recommend it to anyone.

What I really like is that I can follow the routine. I hate--and I mean hate-- dance-y routines. I just can't follow them. Other than a couple jazz boxes I can follow everything she does without hurting myself or others. Thumbs way up!,1245888000,,534,3.9537037037037037

It's extremely demanding, and the moves do require a fairly high amount of coordination, but that makes it more entertaining for me.  The Firm puts out a lot of videos, so I appreciate it when they throw in new combinations.  Having said that, I would not recommend this for an introduction to The Firm.  It helps to be familiar with their other videos, because most of the difficult moves are just variations on things that have shown up before in other workouts.",1245888000,,524,4.484210526315789

3522458,5,B001D261SY,"This is the best Firm workout in a while. I was getting kind of bored and frustrated with recent Firm videos but Kelsie has an authority and energy that really keeps you motivated and moving. Some of the steps come fast but she does a good job of cueing unlike some cute girls I could name(Emily).View once or twice and the routines will be second nature.
Yes, there are lunges but they do not go on endlessly and I found this routine to be much easier on my knees than ""get chiseled"".
This workout is about 60 minutes and there is a short ab set and a decent cool down at the end which The Firm tends to skimp on in shorter videos.
I was impressed at the amount of instruction on proper form, etc. that she gave in addition to the fast paced cuing- I've been doing the Firm for years and I learned stuff I'd never heard before.
I really enjoyed being led by Kelsie and hope to see more workouts from her in the future.",1244160000,,919,4.168539325842697

On the back of the box it does say up to 500 calories but according to my heart rate monitor I burned 370 in one hour which is less than I burn on the elliptical machine in 45 minutes. As for the moves, some were unsafe for the knees. I have had knee surgery and at the end of the twisting lunge segment my knee was throbbing. Sometimes she moves too fast and doesn't really clarify what the moves are. A plus, I do consider myself to be in good if not great shape and this DVD gave me a good workout for the most part. The cardio is interesting, I just wish the Firm wouldnt incorporate so many dance moves because some of us aren't that coordinated.

3522463,2,B001D261SY,"This workout is insane.

I've done plenty of work outs (my personal favs. being those of Jillian Michaels.), but this one is poorly cued. Most instructors at least give some explaination to each move. This isn't the case with this workout. I was missing a lot of moves because I didn't know what the heck to expect. The instructor pretty much just yells the name of the move out and they do it VERY fast.

You would seriously have to watch this video at least 4 times (if not more) to get a concept of the video so when you actually do it you are getting a work out and not just staggering trying to keep up without having proper form.

On that note, if you can't keep up with the ladies of the video then it's doubtful you'll burn 500 calories. If you can, then you may...but otherwise...No.

Would be a great workout if it wasn't so poorly cued. Also if you aren't an avid exerciser you will more then likely get injured if you are not careful.",1242259200,,946,4.268156424581005

But this workout is so intense that I have put it into my routine for days I don't want to go to the gym.  This workout rocks!  I wear my heart rate monitor while doing this workout and I consistently burn at least 530/540 calories.  I totally recommend this tape.  Kelsie is energetic and she gives excellent cues.

I tried a few times, but she changes moves SO fast and if you're like me and not very coordinated (and step routines give you trouble) I would avoid this video.

Kelsie assumes we already know all these moves, she goes way too fast, not telling you to change a move until she's already doing this new move!!! plus she switches moves every beat.  these moves/steps are nothing new.

I didn't even feel like I was getting much out of it at first because I had to start and stop so often. I'm not a beginner exerciser, so I can imagine how the beginners feel trying to keep up with this one. The DVD claims visible results in ten workouts, and I think it probably takes that long to figure out what's going on with each exercise.

My favorite part is when you do the lunges and pushup segment and frankly feel like dropping, and WHAM you go into the toughest cardio segment on the DVD.  After that you are actually relieved to be doing some dips and plies! Imagine that! I have never seen my arms look as good as they do now and frankly between this DVD and dangerouse cuves ahead and Boot camp (with Allison D.)

I found this workout to be challenging and very stimulating; however, there are a few drawbacks.  Kelsie's cueing is off beat and often, without warning, she will add a move.  Some of her moves are new and exciting, as well as hard to follow because she provides no explanation on how to perform the move- you have to figure it out for yourself.  Lastly, I'm really not a fan of holding two dumbbells in one hand.  There is a reason why they sell heavier weights, so you don't need to stack two in one hand!

3522495,4,B001D261SY,"What benefit is a workout if it doesn't challenge your mind and body to change and alter previous notions of a defined workout activity?

The main benefit of the 500 Calorie workout is that once you learn the workout (3-4 complete times), you can really amp up some calorie burning and increase strength (advancing from 3 to 5 to 8 pound weights).  Not for the beginner, but challenging and advanced enough for the intermediate exerciser, the 500 Calorie Workout moves quickly, assuming once you learn the moves, you can concentrate on kicking up the intensity or increasing weights during the strength portions.

Don't be annoyed at pausing the DVD or rewinding to get a particular move down or at modifying the move to protect knees, posture, etc.  Not dance-y, but lively and encouraging.

The only negative is that the DVD is not ""menu-ed"" into segments so you can do all the cardio or all the strength nor can you build your own workout. A DVD remote allows you to move chapter by chapter, but there's no titles, or chapters with each one announcing what that segment will focus.

So I said to myself, ""get over it"" and ""let's do THAT again!""",1234828800,2,1147,4.681592039800995
3522496,4,B001D261SY,I have done this work out a few times and love it. I did not find it hard to keep up with her cuing was slightly off at times but I could catch up quite easily. I love the intensity and energy of this workout routine. Would recommend for intermediate and advanced exercisers. It is a fun workout,1234224000,,295,4.103448275862069
3522497,5,B001D261SY,"I've been doing the Firm TransFIRMer videos for a while, and just found my favorite Firm video so far! Kelsie is a great instructor and works you the entire time. She sets a great pace and cues at the right time.  The steps are unique enough so I don't get bored.  At the end, I felt energized, and surprisingly not exhausted.",1234137600,,326,4.327868852459017
3522498,5,B001D261SY,"I love the firm tapes.  I really like the new ones that you don't need the step and a lot of equipment.  This workout is intense, and you definitely sweat.  It is a great workup.  I try to do this one at least once a week.",1233705600,,222,3.760869565217391
3522499,5,B001D261SY,"This is the second Firm workout I've purchased with Kelsie Daniels as the lead instructor.  While her cuing could be better and a couple of the moves feel awkward, overall this is one workout that will definitely have you sweating! Its become one of my favorite workouts. Enjoy!",1233705600,,278,4.791666666666667
3522500,5,B001D261SY,"I Did this workout yesterday.  I am sore today!! And I workout everyday!! I have alot of Firm Dvds but they are mostly 30 to 45 mins long, I like the hour long, and I did burn over 500 calories.. This is a fast paced video so if you are not familiar with the lingo you will have a hard time getting the moves.  And 3 to 5 lb weights are enough.  The moves are high reps and quick.  The music was a little off at times but it didn't bother me because I was too busy concentrating on the moves to really notice.  Great workout made me sweat on a cold day. I work out with a friend and she quoted "" I Think this is my favorite workout!""",1233360000,13,633,3.8384615384615386
3522501,5,B001D261SY,"I purchased this Dvd and Kelsie kicked my butt , Yes you will burn well over 500 calories . My total burn after the dvd ended was 1179 calories according to my heart rate monitor. Please note if you are heavier you will burn more calories as I did. I love this workout it is my Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday challenge !!!!!!!!! Get this dvd and you will not be disappointed. Peace",1233360000,18,382,4.2465753424657535
3522502,4,B001D261SY,"At first I was quite intimidated by the idea of doing a full hour workout claiming to help you burn 500 calories, but once i did some of the routines it became easier, especially with the modified versions you can do.  The cueing was off a bit but aside from that the more you do this workout the better you get!  Just be careful when first starting out and don't do injury to your knees; take yout time and you will get the moves eventually. I found it challenged me to see if I have what it takes to get the next level of fitness, and I found that I do!  I highly recommend this workout!",1233187200,,589,4.060344827586207
3522503,5,B001D261SY,I loved this video. The workouts are challenging I was out of breath the first 15 minutes. Ilove the different moves and she alternates with lower body and upper body. This music is great and keeps you motivated. This is the 2nd firm video I have with Kelsie Daniels I would also recomment Jump Pump and Jab. Both are excellent,1233187200,,327,4.466666666666667
3522504,3,B001D261SY,"I have been a fan of The Firm tapes for years and this has to be one of the worst ones.  You get a decent workout -- but as many other people have said, the cueing is BAD.  Plus several of the moves are just plain NOT safe.  I'm a certified personal trainer and have done aerobics for years, so I'm pretty experienced at saying this -- the lunges with a twist is just not good for your knees.  Plus some of the moves with weights could definitely hurt you if you are using a heavy weight.  I normally work out using 10 - 20 pound weights and could only use 5 pound weights for most of the video because of the speed and number of reps.  Not sure why she kept saying to use ""medium to heavy weights"".  Overall just very disappointed that The Firm would put out such a poorly put together video.",1232323200,6,793,4.077419354838709
3522505,5,B001D261SY,"I have quite a few of the FIRM exercise dvd's, but I feel that this is by far the best one.  I really feel like I have gotten a complete workout and was even a little sore after the first workout.  I work out 5 times a week and try to do something different every day and this is a great change.  Kelsey is a refreshing and motivating instructor and it is good to see a different face instead of some of the nausating instructors that the FIRM has.  I would highly recommend it.  It is not a beginner workout.  I would say it is more inter/advanced.  You will not be disappointed.",1232323200,,580,4.125
3522506,5,B001D261SY,"This workout was excellent.  I did this video with ankle weights and burned more than 400 calories in 40 minutes.  It is much faster than your average firm workouts.  I don't think this a good video for beginners or those who are new to The Firm.  I was surprised at how fast paced it was from the very beginning.  However, once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing.  I also think people should watch the video first before attempting.  Most firm workouts that go for an hour or more is something that one should build up to.  I just had a baby a few months ago and getting back into shape.  I did more basic firm workouts for about a week before attempting this workout.  I have done this workout twice so far and I believe it will be one of my favorites!!",1232323200,,764,4.171232876712328
3522507,4,B001D261SY,"I love the Firm series, which is the reason why I bought this one--I needed to try out some new routines, but I wanted to stick to the Firm because of their quality.  I was a bit skeptical from the title and the ability to reach that many calories, all w/o using the Fanny Lifter, but get ready, because this is non-stop from start to end.  I loved it!  Some of the routines left me tangled up and a bit frustrated, but hey--it was my first time doing the workout, so I'm confident it will become easier after multiple tries.  Overall, I loved the new challenges and some of the routines I had never done before with weights.  I also really liked Kelsie Daniels and will be looking for add'l workouts with her.  Great video!",1231891200,,724,4.325925925925926
3522508,4,B001D261SY,"This DVD workout is Awesome.  I enjoyed the instructor's energy.  The video was very fast paced and hard to keep up with, but I guess it would have to be in order to burn 500 calories.",1231718400,,184,4.083333333333333

3522510,3,B001D261SY,"I think this is a good buy for the money.  I felt like it was challenging enough but I doubt I burned even close to 500 calories.  Also, in regards to this video, I have the same argument that I have with all the Firm workouts-the cueing is bad and transition are too fast which can eventually lead to injury.",1231718400,,309,4.133333333333334
3522511,2,B001D261SY,"Ms. Daniels seems to have some great, creative moves but the lack of cuing while jumping right to a move that should probably be explained coupled with her utter lack of synchronicity to the music makes it unbearable for me.
I just got Dangerous Curves Ahead and I love it!",1231632000,,273,4.48
3522532,5,B001D261SY,I consider myself at the intermediate workout level and exercise 4 times a week for general health and to maintain weight loss. This dvd is one of the better FIRM workouts. My shirt was drenched at the end of the routine. I absolutely love the combined aerobics/weight training routines and the instructor gives ample time for you to catch on to the moves. This is a keeper for my collection!,1231632000,,392,4.614285714285714
3522533,4,B001D261SY,"OK, here's the deal. This DVD is very fast paced cardio combined with light weights. If you are uncoordinated and have a difficult time learning new dance moves - this DVD will be difficult the first 1 or 2 times around. I am the most horrible dancer on the planet -- I don't even know how to do the Electric Slide. The first time I attempted this DVD, I was standing there completely overwhelmed at the choreography (which is considered ""basic"".) I tried it for the 2nd time around today, and I actually got the hang of it.
Her cuing IS a little bit off. It honestly seems like she cues her moves about 50% of the time. As for the music, I can't comment. When I am doing a workout DVD, I don't notice any music. I'm concentrating so hard on how the instructor is moving and trying to do everything correctly, that they could be playing no music at all and I wouldn't notice.
Chances are this DVD is going to be complicated and frustrating the first time or two that you try it. Once you get accustomed to the instructor and the entire workout itself, you will naturally be able to fall into the choreography and burn 500+ calories. This is a great workout, I sweat buckets after it's finished. I don't have a heart rate monitor to tell you how many calories I've burned, but I can assure you that my heart rate was elevated and my body was challenged in the duration of this workout.",1231286400,,1384,4.326923076923077
3522534,2,B001D261SY,"I have several Firm DVDs and the majority of them are great. I honestly don't know how so many people are giving this five stars. I am definitely an intermediate level exerciser and can follow cueing fairly well, especially after I've done the workout two or three times. The cueing in this is terrible. She tells you to do the move as she's already starting to do the move or in the middle of moves or way before a set. It's all over the place. You get no opportunity to go through each step or section of the set several times before building on. It's build on once and then let's put a huge section together. I do like some of the fresh moves and she does interesting/different things with the weights. But, if I have to literally stand and watch just to try and follow some of the cardio moves or miss several changes and parts of moves, how will I ever burn 500 calories? If you are a beginner or on the less than gifted/not a dancer side of coordination, I would skip this one. The bootcamp and cardio overdrive videos with Alison are much better for burning significant calories. I would only recommend this for people who can learn dance moves fairly quickly, say by watching them once.",1231200000,3,1194,4.407239819004525
3522535,1,B001D261SY,"This dvd was so poorly cued (as mentioned by other reviewers) that I found the potential for injury HIGH.  I am an intermediate exerciser and have been using dvd's to stay in shape for over 12 years.  When you are using compound movements with weights the cuing should be accurate, timely, and in sync with the music and the pace of the exercise none of this is true.  I would not recommend this dvd for anyone looking for a safe/effective cardio/weight workout.",1231200000,12,462,4.609756097560975
3522536,5,B001D261SY,"I was hesitant to purchase this video because I was unfamiliar with the instructor; however, I am thrilled.  If you want a full hour of high intensity cardio this is the workout for you.  Perfect excercise when you know you are going to eat a little extra dessert :)  It reminds me of the intensity the firm had back when it started.  Plus there are a lot of new moves that I haven't seen in other firm workouts (and I have nearly every one).  It was challenging but the moves were so creative it kept me interested.  Definately buy this!",1229644800,17,538,4.33
3522537,4,B001D261SY,"With my Polar FT4 Heart Rate Monitor strapped to my chest, I logged 650 calories burned after completing this workout, and that's kinda awesome, considering the time flies by. Some are saying they didn't burn many calories doing this workout, but I think, like with anything else, what you put into it matters, and I gave it my all. If you push yourself and power through this workout, you'll burn more than 500 calories, I promise.

I took off one star for queuing, as Kelsie is sometimes a bit off when it comes to matching the moves to the beat of the music, and in giving directions a step ahead, so that the exerciser knows what to expect.",1229299200,7,644,4.4576271186440675
3522538,5,B001D261SY,I enjoyed this dvd and it was challening.  I was able to keep step with the music.  If one has trouble keeping rhythm to a beat then it would be difficult for them to keep up with the music.  I worked up a sweat and would recommend this workout.  I did not feel the music and movements were out of sync.,1229126400,2,303,3.918032786885246
3522539,5,B001D261SY,"This is another brilliant workout by The Firm.  I really love it and enjoy doing it a couple of times a week.  Kelsie is a great instructor and makes it more enjoyable.  She cues really well, but is also doesn't kid around - she tells you ""We're here to get results"".
All up, it's a little over an hour, and it's floor aerobics with toning intervals.  It's challenging but easy to follow because the moves are basic (although the workout level is more geared to intermediate exercisers).  There are your usual step touches, jacks and grapevine moves so as you're already familiar with those basics, you don't have to concentrate on too hard moves that you can't keep up with.  She also keeps the variety up all the time so you don't get bored.
I really enjoy this - my heart rate is always up and it's fun to do and makes you sweat.  You really have to try it - it's much better than a lot of other The Firm workouts.  It's a new favourite of mine and I highly recommend it.",1229126400,3,974,4.284153005464481
3522540,4,B001D261SY,"Overall this is a good workout, and I will definitely be doing it again, but I do have a few minor complaints.  For one thing, the rhythm of the movements is off sometimes from the music.  It's not the whole time, but it does occur a few times, especially during cardio intervals, and it's annoying.  My other problem was that Kelsie didn't give much warning sometimes.  She would switch from one movement or combo to another and not tell you she was changing until she was already doing the new movement.  Both of these problems were worsened by the fact that the music was often about the same volume as Kelsie's voice.  So all of these things will make your experience a little more frustrating for your first time, but at least the late cueing and volume balance won't be such a problem after doing the workout a few times.  I'm also hoping that I'll be able to ignore the beat being off, but we'll see.

Enough with the bad, here's the good.  It's a well-rounded, challenging workout.  Kelsie has some new creative moves and combinations that keep the workout interesting.  And like I said in the title, she packs this workout with lunges, so do yourself a favor and don't do this on a day when your legs are already sore.  I'm also glad to get another full hour workout - so many of the ones I've been getting from them lately are around 40 - 45 minutes.",1228608000,48,1360,4.417670682730924

It alternates between kickboxing cardio routines and weight-lifting routines, ending with an ab segment. The exercises are hard, but doable, and Kelsie is a good instructor - encouraging and dynamic but not annoyingly peppy. Best of all, it's a bit over an hour long, giving you a really solid workout.

8291246,5,B001D261SY,"I have a huge collection of workout dvds.  I bought this one several years ago, when I started a rigorous and consistent home workout daily routine, which I have kept up. I just did it once, deciding that the moves were complicated and frustrating.  Now, years later, when I tried it again, I loved it!  I think with more experience under my belt, I realize how wonderful it is to be able to spend an hour working out and NOT be bored!  So many workouts are super repetitive, which creates a dread factor that's not going away.  Yes, some of the moves are complicated here, although interestingly most are at the beginning of the workout.  But, with repetition, you will master them and, besides, does it really matter if you're not doing it perfectly?  Just keep moving and you're getting a great workout anyway.  Now I find that I'm just loving this dvd and appreciating the lack of boring repetitions - it makes the workout fly by.  And, you'll notice that most of the time the women working out in the background have smiles on their faces.  They're enjoying themselves, and so did I.  The price of this dvd is great.  I totally recommend it.  Just prepare yourself to not get the routine down perfectly the first few times, and then prepare yourself to have a fun filled hour workout that is dynamite for your body and your health!",1493164800,2,1336,4.539748953974895
