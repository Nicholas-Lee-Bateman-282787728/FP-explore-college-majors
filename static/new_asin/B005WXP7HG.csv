8488173,3,B005WXP7HG,The movie is very good but for some reason the subtitles are cut off.  I tried adjusting my player but subtitles do not display fully.  I also put in another DVD with subtitles and had no problem with the subtitle displaying on monitor.,1424304000,,236,4.465116279069767
8488174,3,B005WXP7HG,"There are many irritating aspects to this drama (to a greater or lesser extent common to most Korean dramas, but particularly pronounced here)
- Long scenes of people starring into space would be fine, were it not for extremely annoying accompanying ""music""
- stereotypical endless (and mindless) drinking whenever faced with a problem (unfortunately a cliche for Korean dramas), followed by objects being thrown/smashed in blind rage
- a weak script, for example setting up unlikely encounters (protagonists always happening to encounter each other by sheer coincidence)
- prolonged spells of crying, adopting a passive role when faced with difficulties (even after the Gramsci reference should have made them aware of what needs to be done)

Ha Ji Won is miscast in this drama - the occasional flares of minor rebellion don't make up for the protagonist's overall fatal passivity

The ending was quite predictable, after all, and in a sense neat.

Still, overall a worthwhile attempt at social criticism, with a couple of genuinely tragic figures surrounded by a mixture of standard Korean drama characters. Not the best KBS production by a long shot, but worth seeing.",1418601600,,1171,5.218085106382978
8488175,5,B005WXP7HG,"Although the series has some of the usual Korean series problems such as the characters inexplicitly not stating simple facts or feelings to one another, the upsetting surprise ending finally pulls  the plot's convoluted storylines into a logical, if unsympathetic explanation.

Ha Ji Won once again has a hard time balancing her character's inner toughness with the continual displays of exterior meekness. It is like watching a ping pong ball bounce between strength and weakness. It does not come across as believable. Whether this is the fault of the script or her acting ability causes some concern. Otherwise, watch it and have unsettled feelings afterward. Never ever skip to the end!!!",1393200000,,693,5.2342342342342345
