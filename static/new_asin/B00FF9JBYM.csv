5986619,4,B00FF9JBYM,"From beginning to end it's an enjoyable film.  The acting is all solid and the message, while ~Christian, is subtle enough to not feel preachy.  It will make you smile!  (it's based in Cincinnati, OH - shooting & production; I make an effort to support 'the little guy' type of production companies and I'm rarely disappointed...they have the guts to stray from the cookie-cutter formulas the rest follow)",1389744000,,405,4.926470588235294
5986620,4,B00FF9JBYM,"This was a strange kind of different, so creative.  Some powerful moments mixed in with fresh fun.  I didn't expect to cry. Nice touch.",1388880000,,135,4.583333333333333
5986621,5,B00FF9JBYM,"A strange brand of happy is a much better Faith-friendly film than most Christian films. The message is not explicitly evangelical, but rather raises the question that God not only exists, but cares about your happiness. I look forward to more movies from Rebel Pilgrim Productions.",1388707200,6,282,5.1521739130434785
5986622,4,B00FF9JBYM,"Brad Wise pulls together what I like to call, a rare ""Napoleon Dynamite"" type movie. Sometimes silly, sometimes awkward, and all around very dry... However, it works, and it works well.
I went in to the theater expecting it to be mediocre at best, and found myself laughing pretty hard at moments throughout.
The story is charming, and well played out. Some beautiful shots of Rebel Pilgrim Film's home city of Cincinnati.
Joe Boyd really steals the show from St. James and even Shirley Jones, he is downright hilarious at times, and has the least notoriety of the three. Two time poetry slam champion Anis Mojgani makes an endearing appearance while reciting one of his gorgeous spoken word poems, which is definitely a treat.

The only true con with ""Happy"" is that the movie as a whole, seems like a compilation of witty scenes that all reference the plot line. It's not that the story is not told well, but often times the scenes will cut pretty quick, which leaves the scene feeling a bit rushed.
However, with the use of some cartooning, the transitions become very unique and enjoyable.

Don't start this film expecting some typical romance film, because it is far from that. I don't even like romance films, but this film does not feel like one at all. This film is an experience of finding who you are, and who you want to be.
Take this beautiful independent film for what it is and you will not be disappointed, I promise you will be just as entertained, if not more so, by this than you would a typical hollywood romance film. This film is charming, and fun, and I don't think you will be disappointed after viewing, once you take it for what it is. An independent film, by an independent film company, in a smaller city like Cincinnati. Taking that into consideration, it's not just pretty good. It's fantastic. It's good indie film making! All around!",1388707200,5,1864,4.6454545454545455
5986623,4,B00FF9JBYM,"""A Strange Brand of Happy"" (2013 release; 92 min.) brings the story of David (played by Joe Boyd), who in the opening scenes of the movie is being let go from his crappy corporate job. David's roommate Ben gets to know Joyce (played by Rebecca St. James), an Australian life coach/yoga teacher/community volunteer, and before we know it Ben sets up David with Joyce. Later on, we find out that the guy who fired David, is also interested in Joyce. Will Joyce end up with David? or David's ex-boss? or maybe Ben? To tell you much more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: writer-director Brad Wise made this movie into a labor of love, and it shows. The movie is one of those ""quirky little movies that could"". I found myself thoroughly entertained, and found myself chuckling at the dry sense of humor displayed by the character of David. And what about Rebecca St. James! In her initial scene, she immediately radiates charm, not to mention good looks (she reminds me of Julia Louis-Dreyfus). A good part of the movie plays out at a retirement center, with a bunch of interesting characters, including one played by none other than Shirley ""The Partridge Family"" Jones. The movie is set in and shot in Cincinnati, and you'll see a bunch of Cincinnati-only names such as Graeter's ice cream, Dewey's pizza, Speckled Bird Caf, etc. There is also a delicious soundtrack of indie music sprinkled throughout the movie, featuring among others a number of Cincinnati (Fiction & Fables; The Seedy Seeds; Ellery) and Louisville (Nerves Junior; Cheyenne Mize; Kyle James Hauser) bands; the soundtrack is available here on Amazon.

This movie showed up at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati about a month ago, and played for just a few weeks before disappearing. That doesn't negate the fact that this is an enjoyable small movie that will keep your attention from start to finish, and may surprise you along the way a few times as well. If you are in the mood for an indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, I can readily recommend you seek out this movie, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blue-ray.",1382918400,4,2215,4.72093023255814

5986638,1,B00FF9JBYM,"Whoo-eee, this one is a stinker!  The acting is stiff and wooden and the script is the worst ever.  Brutally boring, lame, obviously slow - not an ounce of real creativity went into this.  No witty dialogue, no depth or emotion or range of interesting human interest.  Just dumb and cliched.  And the worst part of it all is that this supposedly Christian film portrays Christians as slow, simple-minded, shallow, easily fooled, and just a tad dense.  There wasn't a single Christian character in the film I wanted to be like.",1448409600,,526,4.725274725274725

8615134,4,B00FF9JBYM,"An engaging Christian-based movie that keeps your attention throughout!  No bad language; good moral values.  The storyline had one glaring implausibility (an unemployed guy who can't pay the utilities being able to afford to pay a life coach), but overall, it was well done.  Well acted, good writing, feel-good kind of story.  You could see the ending a mile away, but it was still a good movie.  I'd watch other movies produced/directed/written by this team because I have a high appreciation for a ""clean"" movie.  Well done.",1468886400,,528,5.011494252873563
