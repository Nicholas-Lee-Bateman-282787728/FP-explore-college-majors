8442632,5,B004V2FVH0,"What a wonderful film by Raj Khosla! No doubt Raj Khosla made Nutan and Asha Parekh perform so marvelously that both of them gave their best in the film. Thus Nutan won the FilmFare Award for Best Actress and Asha Parekh was only nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Dr. Rahi Masoom Reza penned excellent dialogues. He also won Filmfare for Best Dialogue. Raj Khosla won Best Film Award too. Only music was remaining for this flick but Raj Kapoor's Satyam Shivam Sundaram also released in 1978 and it had much better soundtrack so it couldn't win Best Music Director Award for Laxmikant Pyarelal. The song ""Main Tulsi Tere Aagan Ki Koi Nahin Mein Tere Saajan Ki"" is the soul of the entire story. Anand Bakshi penned the lyrics so carefully that each word and simile used compliment the story. Other song ""Chhaap Tilak Sab Cheeni Moh Se Naina Milaike"" was Ammer Khusroo's song but Raj Kholsa always had Folk song in his movie such as ""Bindya Chamkegi"" in Do Raaste (1969). So this too had its Folk song which was by Ammer Khusroo. However Anand Bakshi wrote it nicely so its grace wasn't lost. Lata Mangeshkar gave her best for Laxmikant Pyarelal's music as always she did.

Coming back to movie the performance of Vinod Khanna and Vijay Anand is also nice. The way Raj Khosla portrayed Thakurs was distinctive. Screenplay and Editing were too good which never dragged the movie. I would rate as 10/10 as there are no obvious flaws and imperfection in direction and production. One must watch it!!",1305849600,,1498,4.717557251908397
