8537289,4,B00979KQMC,A cute romantic comedy.  Loretta Young plays the oldest of three sisters who decide to leave their chicken farm and pool their recent inheritance to get Young a rich husband.  She finds a toss-up between Joel McCrea and David Niven as who to choose.  Toss in problems with comedian Stu Erwin as a bartender threatening to warn the men about the gold diggers and the fun begins.  I recently watched the remake of this one and enjoyed it so I decided to watch the original also.  I was not disappointed.  Cute story.,1413676800,4,514,4.532608695652174

8537293,5,B00979KQMC,"Movie & sound copy is typical for the era, very acceptable. Light hearted romantic comedy. Great California settings around Santa Barbara",1361750400,6,137,5.571428571428571
8537294,4,B00979KQMC,"Loretta Young and David Niven do not have chemistry - which leads me to wonder why they are so frequently paired - but this works for them in this film. The movie is funny and probably tapped into the poverty of the time better than today, but while dated in its theme, the final conclusions are not. Enjoy. (Joel McCrea fans will not be disappointed either)",1361145600,13,358,4.4393939393939394
