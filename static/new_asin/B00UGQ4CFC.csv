As the editor of The Paris Review he helped bring work from some of the best young (and not so young) authors of his time to the public consciousness. He also interviewed an astonishing number of great writers for the magazine as well. At the same time, he had the much more publicly visible career as a participatory journalist who insisted on becoming the thing he was writing about. In the process he momentarily played quarterback for the Detroit Lions, played percussion with the New York Philharmonic, got on the trapeze in a professional circus, and so much more. He never pretended to be good at these things. But in reporting on his inevitable failures, he could still bring a joyful taste of the feel of the reality to his prose - something the usual objective outsider journalist never could.

While the film is always interesting, often fun, and occasionally touching, it never dives very deep. Clearly enamored of its subject, it does ask the occasional tough question about what motivated this child of the way-upper class to follow this peculiar life of odd public (mis)adventure, but generally it sticks to surfaces, glossy and charming though they are. It skips over decades at a time, as well as huge life changes, and generally sticks to the already public and known highlights.

The result is never boring, and a film Im glad I saw, but also a film I have a hard time imagining feeling I ever need to see again.",1464998400,,1499,4.757692307692308
