8116793,2,B000F3AAK2,This anime i did not like it was not that fun to watch. Also references about death made me not like it. It is not that funny to me. 2 stars from me.,1356134400,,149,3.5454545454545454
8116794,2,B000F3AAK2,"Just to be frank this series was by far the worst thing I've ever bought. I had the feeling that yuri would be in here and all but this series focused so much on it, it made the rest of the anime parts really not matter at all. Plot wasn't too good, fights were mediocre even for the final battle. Thank goodness I did not buy this full price. I think I'll just sell this anime to someone who cared more for the yuri then anything else, since that's all this anime seemed to really focus on.",1267747200,,491,4.072164948453608
8116795,4,B000F3AAK2,"no spoilers in here. But I will say the character designs are good and the story is really tragic, And watch after the credits for closure.",1182816000,,139,4.384615384615385
