7950034,4,B00005QB4T,"I wanted to give a different opinion since several reviews were negative.

Shatter Dead is NOT a zombie movie like the Romero movies or 28 Days Later or the Dawn remake.  All those are GREAT movies, but this one is different.

This is an artsy movie.  The opening segment supposedly explains things, but if I hadn't read the box, I wouldn't have understood.  Don't expect horror.  Expect creepiness and bizarre stuff, but I don't think anything in this acually scared me.

Why four stars?  It's weird.  And weird like too many bigger-budget films are not willing to be.  I recommend it.",1114819200,7,586,4.712871287128713
7950035,1,B00005QB4T,"I'm the biggest zombie movie fan ever and i also love a good ... movie, but this film fails in both respects.  It's not even funny bad, just annoying and so low budget, the film looks like a home movie.  And if this doesn't scare u away from the film, i think the fact that the zombies talk and beg for change on the street might keep zombie fans away.  A huge waste of money.",1057708800,2,376,3.986666666666667
7950036,1,B00005QB4T,"The movie started out with an interesting premise:  When the Angel of Death impregnates a mortal woman, the dead stop dying.  But instead of the dead trying to gnaw on the living, they simply exist - roaming the earth with no purpose.  If done right, this could have been a good movie, but since this is low budget indie it get's ugly in alot of places.  And it really takes some skill to take this premise and produce a horrible movie, but it has been done here.
I too, was excited after reading the desription on the back of the case but 5 minutes into the movie I knew what I was in for, a sleep-inducing bore.  We have it all here: a gasoline siphoning one-armed zombie, a Lex Luthor clone preacher, a freaky long haired guy who hits on anyone, a group of undead hillbillies led by Howard Stern's identical twin (who produces the ONLY saving grace of this movie - ""HE SHOOTS, HE SCORES!!""), but the final dagger in the heart is Stark Raven, who couldn't act her way out of a...I'm too disturbed to even think of a good analogy.  To put it succinctly, she is horrible.  I still wonder why she kept a handgun and mirror under her armpit.  And in that scene where she is telling the car to stop?  It looks like she is trying to use some sort of psychic power to stop it.
There is some gore and a sickening scene involving a hand-gun (the gun in this scene is not used in it's normal sense).  Disgusting.  The movie ends...it just ends, nothing is resolved at all.
Avoid this movie, I don't care how many awards this may have won.",1029110400,2,1530,4.277777777777778
