7798867,1,1575236311,"I'm considering a trip to Buenos Aires, so I've been checking out anything and everything related to it for any bit of context I can get.  But this video is an utter waste of time even for a public library loan.

It may be geared towards the rich and famous who want a sheltered and familiar experience, visiting upscale hotels and restaurants.  But I can't imagine anyone not being irritated by the nauseatingly affected mannerisms of the host and Mary Dilts and Lauren Hutton (who appears as if she is trying to seduce the camera operator).

Instead, I would wholeheartedly recommend Lonely Planet's Argentina video, regardless of your travel budget.",1128729600,,652,4.9
7798868,4,1575236311,"Despite the grumpy review posted here which portrays this video as elitist, it is in fact based on the a series written for United Airlines' in-flight magazine, which is about mass market as you can get.  Sure, you CAN locate a Days Inn in Honolulu, but why not show one of its better hotels, such as the Mandarin Oriental Kahala?  Most of the readers here are going to pay a bundle to get to Hawaii, and might as well know what the top end of the market, in housing at least, looks like.  Only three restaurants are portrayed: La Mer and Indigo are perennial favorites in Zagat, and Buzz's is a simple steak house on the windward side of the island.  That said, this video recommends a number of charming things frequently overlooked by people getting a package tour look at the islands: the Mission Houses museum area downtown, Chinatown (although they could have mentioned the lei shops there), Lyon Arboretum and the Museum of Art.  You could do a lot worse than follow the advice here.",1091923200,,990,4.570621468926554
7798869,2,1575236311,"Fairly good, could of been much better. Very nice Photography, very limited information about things to do with too much emphasis on certain stores and hotels instead of sights.  Note - This video is only about 22 minutes long. Subtract the intro and closing and  you only have about 15 minutes of usable information.",995155200,,317,4.851851851851852
7798870,2,1575236311,"What a disappointment this video is.  It is apparently the exact content of the syndicated television program that spawned it with no additional footage or information included.  Much of the screen time is taken up by Lauren Hutton's introduction and closing comments, leaving about 15 minutes total time to view Paris.  The recommendations for spending one's three ""perfect days"" are definitely geared toward the upmarket audience (e.g., stay at the Hotel Ritz, take taxis everywhere,etc.), with no particular insider's advice about such important things as how long one can expect to spend on each recommended visit or the cost (or practicality) of any recommended activity.  I wish I had saved my money to spend in Paris!  That said, the photography was beautiful, although we receive only the briefest glimpses of the wonders or Paris.",973468800,21,839,5.231343283582089
7798871,1,1575236311,"Based upon the ""Three Perfect Days"" series in the United Airlines in-flight magazine, this 30-minute video simply doesn't cut it. Instead of focusing on the more enduring sights of Buenos Aires, it takes the viewer into a never-ending stream of hotels, restaurants and shops, accompanied by a series of slick narrators, presumably added because of their ""sophistication.""
And Lauren Hutton? If, like I, you once considered her to be one of the most natural, and beautiful, women in the world, you're going to be disappointed by her performance here. Coiffured in one of those god-awful onion-ring hair-dos popularized by Nicole Kidman, and speaking in an affected manner, she comes across as a first-rate phony. She could at least have learned how to properly pronounce ""Buenos Aires.""
Unless you're a masochist, skip this one.",969926400,10,827,5.225563909774436
