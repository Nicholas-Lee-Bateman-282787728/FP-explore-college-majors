5862856,1,B00DXOIU16,I buy dumb stuff. I pay too much for things. Dexter is my favorite series ever and this set is cool. But seriously with the price?,1374796800,17,130,4.038461538461538
5862857,1,B00DXOIU16,"The price of this box set is ridiculously too high for any average collector to purchase. I don't understand why there has to be 25 discs total meaning 4 discs per season and one bonus. Why couldn't it be 1 or 2 discs per season like other TV shows such as The Walking Dead. Just because you add a bunch of extra discs and a blank dummy head with minimal detail doesn't justify the price and the asking amount that they want. As much as many people want it, nobody would be able to afford this set. Unless the price is dropped to maybe under $200 nobody will buy it... Please drop the price.",1374537600,16,591,4.192982456140351
5862858,1,B00DXOIU16,"I love the Dexter series, but there is no way that I am ever paying $386 for a few disks and a plastic holder.  Price gouging much?",1374451200,18,131,3.8518518518518516
5862879,5,B00DXOIU16,"I have never seen one episode.  Nope not one.  I have showtime that has the series available on demand.  This show has made so much noise by news articles and my friends for many years.  I wanted to own a piece of it forever especially since it a GoldBox deal.  I bought this series while it was on sale but wished it was also available on digital HD which this collection was not.  With all the hype that its got, I pretty sure I will buy the entire HD collection again.",1445731200,,471,4.1208791208791204
5862880,5,B00DXOIU16,This is one of the best collector's editions of a tv show that I've ever purchased. Right up there with the Breaking Bad series barrel. The quality is pretty solid and it doesn't have any defects that I've noticed. The book is high quality print and the discs all seem to function just fine. I love how massive it is (I'll include a picture to show it compared to other boxsets and such). It was easily worth every penny I spent on it but keep in mind that I bought it on sale for $120 instead of the full $550 or so. If you like the show I recommend it completely.,1444435200,5,565,4.099099099099099
5862881,4,B00DXOIU16,"First off, I'm not the type of person who buys collectibles. I get it; you pay more because it's a limited edition. I was NOT going to by this version. I had the cardboard slide box set on my wish list for a long time, waiting for a good deal. Then the good deal happened for both versions and this one was only a little bit more. No-brainer.  This thing is beautiful! It's huge; a full-sized bust. Essentially a functional piece of art to display. HOWEVER:
The design of the disc holder is a bit clumsy. I did not want to open the box but the top of the head had popped open during shipping.  I noticed that this had been produced over two years ago (there was a sticker on the box instructing to ""display before store opens November 12,2013""), and I can only assume the stickers holding everything together really weren't meant to last that long and survive a lot of moving and tossing around. Either that, or they weren't put on very well in the first place. Some of the stickers labeling each of the seasons were not placed smoothly; I would expect more for something that costs hundreds of dollars.  Also, there were quite a few imperfections in the plastic along the edges that look like it was not very carefully separated from the mold. There were small chunks of plastic missing on top of each shoulder where the front and back piece come together. I would have been mad if I had paid a lot for it, but since I essentially paid the price of the regular box set on sale, I am very happy and can't wait to display it in my home theater.",1443657600,,1543,4.313793103448276
5862882,1,B00DXOIU16,"This review is in reference to the recent collectors gift set- the white head edition
 The price of $400 for this set is nutty and even more nutty than the usual nutty is that this set was released in a different collectors box a few years ago.  If this was the first and only release Id still say they are asking too much but to come out with this appears to be a clueless cash grab.  Amazon had a gold box deal on this for around $110 and thats more reasonable. Wait for Christmas this'll drop soon enough.",1443571200,,508,4.163265306122449
5862883,4,B00DXOIU16,The last two seasons stopped me from giving this 5 stars.,1443312000,,57,4.2727272727272725
5862884,5,B00DXOIU16,"WOW!...Impressive as heck...I guess you have to be a rabid fan to spend that kind of dough...and I got a great deal!
I hope none of the 25 BD are defective as it will be a while before I get through these.
Careful when twisting open the head...the springs are tense enough to make the top stored discs to go out flying!",1422403200,6,319,4.161290322580645
5862885,4,B00DXOIU16,"""Dexter"" is one of my favorite TV series. I miss the show now that it's over. Of course, one of the great things about a TV series coming to an end is that you get a nice complete box set to commemorate the series. This ""Dexter"" complete collection is one of the most interesting blu-ray set designs I've seen. One piece of advice: these box sets usually drop significantly in price as time goes on - I'd wait until Amazon has it as a Gold Box deal, or perhaps it will go on sale during Black Friday.

Here's what's included:
1. Gift Set Mannequin packaging (note: the discs are stacked on top of each other, so be careful when removing them to avoid scracthes).
2. ""Grafix"": The Art of Dexter book
3. Bonus Disc with New Special Features
- Behind-the-Scenes Cast Interviews, Featurettes and Promos
- ""The Evolution of Dexter Morgan"" Documentary
- ""The Code"" Documentary

If you like the show but don't yet own the seasons on blu-ray, then this is the perfect collection for you. If you've never seen the show, then I encourage you to give it a chance. I know some people who are put off by the premise of a blood spatter guy who moonlights as a serial killer, but I assure you the series is much more complex than that and you really enjoy the characters and the story. This blu-ray set is the perfect way for you to catch up with this great series.

Although it's not for everyone, I really enjoy the dark themes presented in the show. It's a constant struggle for Dexter to keep his work a secret -- he works for Miami-Metro Homicide department, surrounded by the very people looking for him. And while certain characters are glad that someone is ridding the world of bad people, there are many other characters who see Dexter's actions as an insult to law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Being the rational and peaceful person that I am... Dexter's actions on the show are not justified from my perspective. But it's still fun to watch someone on television who embraces the darker side of his personality and channels it to potentially rid the world of criminals. You are stunned to find that you come to like the main character - who would've thought that a killer could be this likable?

There are some seasons that are better than others (Seasons 3 and 4 are my personal favorites), but I think they are all worth a watch because each season is essential to the story. The show looks into Dexter's past traumas; sometimes the writers put him into adversarial relationships with other serial killers; and throughout the series Dexter is exposed to various ideas about family, fatherhood, and faith; and eventually his secret is discovered by those closest to him. It's all a marvel to watch unfold. This is one of the best shows and best performances on television.",1400976000,7,2785,4.597585513078471
5862886,1,B00DXOIU16,"Being a supporter of the series I ordered this item. I was highly anticipating adding this set to my collection of head editions. When it arrived my anticipation was quickly quelled and rapidly replaced with regret when the majesty of this perfectly plastic-y  plastic parcel was revealed from its cardboard shipping encasement. A single tear rolled down my jaw as I saw the COMPLETE split at all of  the seams that were supposed to hold this obscenely priced item together having yet to even slice open the redundantly placed piece of TAPE that held together the MAGNETIC flap enclosure. Upon entry, the item looked used. I tried to convince myself that maybe the bust should be as I first saw it, and that some assembly would be required, then reality set in. As I released the figure from the already broken foam inserts, the discs promptly ejected from the top of the head then rolled about all over. Further extraction unveiled the severity of the damage, and still I tried to force redemptive reasoning on my purchase, and could not. Foam bits were strewn all over the discs, all over the bust, and inside too. The one that I received wore scuffs, abrasions, and discolorations. The only identifiable feature, the red scalpel cheek scar turned out to be a sticker which was also peeling off. Thanks, but no thanks. On the bright side Amazon was kindly accommodating in granting me a prompt refund for the THIRD PARTY SOLD package. I believe that/know that regardless of the condition of this item it would in no way warrant this astronomical asking price given the cheap quality and materials that it is made from.",1394150400,16,1620,4.761565836298932
5862887,5,B00DXOIU16,"Guess what? I have not opened the box nor do I plan to. Why? Because this is a collector's item meant to be given a special spot on display amongst your BluRay/DVD collection, or anywhere in your living room...maybe your night stand. If you want to watch the blu ray discs, it makes more sense to buy each season separately or the other cheaper gift set. Collectors will be very pleased with this item. It is catchy, a conversation piece and just a delight to look at. If you are not into collecting, you will most likely not appreciate having to pay for the extra packaging (but please bear with us collectors who love this stuff and who love the producers who go the extra mile to make items like this.)",1390608000,2,705,4.3893129770992365
5862888,5,B00DXOIU16,"The delivery was fantastically quick, the packaging was sturdy, and It came with no dings, chips, scrapes or problems.

The Pro's:
Amazing collection, and since I got it during a gold deal sale it was the same price as buying the complete series any other way.
The head looks amazing on any dexter fan's bookshelf and honestly really makes the kit for me.
The DVD Spring loader is easy to open and shut and does a great job of holding everything together.
The Art of Dexter book is a great read and honestly a treat to have.

The Con's:
The drawer for the Art book slides open a little too easily.
Not on sale, the price point is a bit daunting.

Overall: A must buy for true fans and memorabilia collectors!",1390348800,13,708,4.3893129770992365
5862909,1,B00DXOIU16,"The show was good, however the box and bluray set is not worth anywhere near $200-500.
I would highly suggest waiting for it to get on netflix...",1387756800,9,145,4.407407407407407
5862910,2,B00DXOIU16,"I loved Dexter through the first four seasons, but hated the last four. It just got worse and worse, starting with the season 5 addition of Julia Stiles, the snooze inducing season 6, the uneventful season 7 and infuriatingly incoherent final season.
The ending was a hundred times worse and far less satisfying than the LOST finale.",1386460800,9,333,4.859649122807017
5862911,5,B00DXOIU16,"I haven't purchased this set, but all the one star rating ""reviews"" didn't either.  Just figured I'd give it five stars for some balance, and hey, what does it matter, amazon seems to not do any policing on the reviews.  How can a review be allowed to stay up from someone who hasn't purchased the product?  Either way, Dexter is a great show, and this looks like a really cool collectors item.

Stop whining about the price, and get over it.",1386028800,12,442,4.419753086419753

Super Acting, Directing, and Of Course the Screenplays Made it what it was. Cagey, Clever, Never Dull, Always Dexter.  Ever year it got Better.  A Gotten Have Product for All Dexter Lovers and there are Millions and Millions.",1385164800,6,350,4.766666666666667
5862913,1,B00DXOIU16,"Hmmm....  got some money and have some options.  I can spend a half-grand on:

-My mortgage payment
-Two car payments (paying a month ahead...nice!)
-A PS4 or Xbox One or whatever....
-Enough Pez to fill a bathtub
-THIS.

Honestly, after an epic season 4 that catapulted this series to the top of my must-watch list, the show became disappointing.  Season 8 was disgusting.

My recommendation: don't pay hundreds for a white featureless head with a cut on it.  Get the blood slide set....and even that's not worth it, but at least half the price.",1384646400,10,546,4.74468085106383
5862914,5,B00DXOIU16,"I am curious about the unfounded haters reviewing this product. This isn't the Dexter series collection you buy for your mother or a friend that never saw the show. This is for the people that were rabid since day 1 for Dexter. Hell yes it's expensive. It should be, it is an EXCLUSIVE COLLECTOR'S EDITION. This is more of a piece of art to display than a campy box to house a couple of blurays. If all you want are the disks you are wasting your money. Not because you bought this - but because you likely opened it, threw the box away and put your greasy fingers all over it then gave it to your 3 year old to play with on the living room floor. That is not what this is for. I bought the blood slide version to watch myself. This one is for show. That is how much I love Dexter, this item is aimed at people like me. That said, here was my experience:

I pre-ordered this the moment it went up on amazon. I wasn't phased by the peanut gallery voicing their dismay over the price of something they never intended to buy. When it finally arrived... the item inside the retail box was inserted upside down. In other words, the head was pointing down while the words on the box were facing up. So I returned it. I never intended on removing this from the box. It will remain sealed to keep its value at its highest. Breaking the tape that seals the box to correct a seemingly minor flaw is actually a big deal to me. Amazon was wonderful, I had a second one on its way as soon as I hung up the phone. The 2nd one was fine so I shipped back the first on their dime.. Thank you amazon!

Now as far as the piece itself. You have to see it for yourself to do it justice. YES it is expensive but let me tell you - This thing is HUGE! It's a 1:1 scale. A Full sized bust. This thing belongs in a glass case with a signed knife and other memorabilia from the show, that is exactly what I plan to do with it.",1384646400,46,1899,4.0344827586206895
5862915,1,B00DXOIU16,This packaging is as lame as the finale was.  The content inside maybe cool but the packaging just isn't.  Plus where the hell are you going to put this thing?  not impressed at all.  The blood slides packaging is better.,1380758400,12,221,4.45
5862916,5,B00DXOIU16,"I love ""Dexter"".  But I'm not buying this set.  Why?  Because I already have the previous seasons on disc and this final season is preordered.  For those kvetching about the price, do you realize you can still get the show(the important part) without the extra packaging at a reasonable price?

You aren't forced to buy this and you don't (I would guess) have a health issue that requires you to buy a big white manikin head every third Tuesday and now your life is endangered. Just don't buy it or wait for the price to go down. Showtime can charge whatever they want and if it doesn't sell the price will go down.

5862917,1,B00DXOIU16,"I was hooked on this show when it aired on CBS network TV for this first season. The show has ever since aired on CBS's sibling cable network Showtime and since I refuse to be a prisoner to the cable/satellite networks outlandish fees I have been suffering from Dexter withdrawls. I have occasionally been able to watch a few episodes here and there, so when I saw the complete box set series I said sign me up!!! I then came to my senses when I saw the price tag. ""YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME"" Thankfully many other Dexter fans have voiced their outrage at these prices, but I haven't read any complaints that many other TV shows that have up to twice as many show per season in their sets are less expensive? Most shows have 22 or more episodes per season, but Dexter and some others only have 12 episodes per season so again, they want you to pay double the cost for half the amount of episodes??? WTH!!!  I know that my math isn't the greatest, but I know that this just doesn't add up to any kind of a good value. ""PLEASE DEXTER FANS BAN TOGETHER AND REFUSE TO PAY THESE OUTRAGIOUS PRICES AND SEND THEM A MESSAGE"" WE ARE MAD AS HE*@ AND WE AREN'T GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!

5862939,2,B00DXOIU16,"I have been a fan since I watched the very first episode when it aired. Probably got my attention because my middle name is Dexter. I have put off buying any seasons just for something like this. But this is too costly. As another reviewer said, buying all 8 seasons for $30 is $240. Plus lets face it, after the novelty wears off, then you have this bust to store. Ill wait for the blood slide edition to drop below $300 thanks.",1376697600,4,429,4.2439024390243905

It isn't on the UK version of amazon yet and I can't really order it from the US as the dvd region is different here in the UK, as I've seen in the product description the US are region 1 and the UK is region 2. Regardless of my issue, this is a must buy for any true dexter fan! I already have the first 7 seasons on dvd but I will still be buying this or the blood slide edition, and giving away the dvds I own at the moment. Seems like a waste of money to a lot of people but I don't really mind paying for something I really like and enjoy!

Its basically a mess once you take them out. The pieces are glued very unsecurelly together.

It's almost life-sized.
