2424887,5,B000BMSUJK,"I THINK THAT THE PRODUCTION DIARIES ARE A GREAT IDEA. I NOT ONLY LOVE THESE KINDS OF MOVIES AND THINK THAT THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH OF THEM (CREATURE FILMS). I ALSO LOVE TO SEE HOW THEY MAKE THESE MOVIES. IT'S JUST VERY INTERESTING TO ME. THIS FILM HAS BEEN IN THE MAKING FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND I HAVE FOLLOWED IT FROM DAY ONE. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE FILM. BUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE THEY EXPLORE IN DEPT THE MAKING OF A FILM IS A GREAT IDEA. WHETHER YOU BUY SPECIAL EDITION OR EXTENDED EDITIONS OF MOVIES IS YOUR CHOICE, BUT I ALWAYS BUY UPDATED EDITIONS OF MOVIES AND DVD. I'M A COLLECTOR AND LOVE TO OWN THE WHOLE POTATO. I WILL BE BUYING THIS. IF YOU LOVE CREATURE FILMS AND LIKE TO SEE HOW THEY ARE MADE, I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS. PEACE.",1132444800,16,747,4.123287671232877

2424889,5,B000BMSUJK,"Peter Jackson has been a favorite for a while, but when I stumbled across these production diaries he became my hero.  I have been student of film for a while but not wealthy enough to attend a film school. Peter in his humbleness offers viewers the back stage pass into the world of a major motion picture. I haven't seen the DVD collection of these diaries, but I have watched all the episodes several times over and over.

A special 16-minute feature examines the development to final product of Kong's eye-popping ""fight in the vines"" with three T-Rexes.  This over the top set piece is a brilliant example of the state of the art, innovative production design that informs every frame of Jackson's amazing film.

2424916,2,B000BMSUJK,"I purchased each expanded DVD set for LOTR, enjoying the extras, and had been downloading some of the production diaries from the KongIsKing website until I heard they would be issuing these DVDs.  I decided to stop ""wasting"" my time downloading and just purchase the set. Note: the downloading wasn't illegal, since even encouraged by the site, but was prohibited once they issued this DVD set.  Unfortunately, despite the hefty price for 2 DVDs, only a handful of all production diaries are on each DVD; these easily could have fit on one DVD.  Moreover, no pre-production or post-production diaries are on the DVDs.  The only reason to get this set is if you're into marketing chotchkies which, though hokey, are creative.  The set still has limited use in instructing film students -- the reason I wanted the diaries -- but I was sorely disappointed with my purchase.  I emailed the KongIsKing site about my disappointment, but no answer after 2 weeks.  Peter, where are you?",1142467200,5,979,4.8969696969696965

This is probably due to the fact that the extras on the 2-disc set of the movie contains the production diaries AFTER the ones on this set which cover pre-production stuff.",1141257600,7,422,4.552631578947368

2424931,4,B000BMSUJK,"Although I found the entire package to be great overall I am a bit disappointed as nothing was added new besides the packaging.

All the footage is the same as seen on the Web Production Diaries of Konisking.net, not that it's bad but I would have enjoyed seeing more.

Other than that the casing is unique and comes with some nifty conceptual art, only thing that irks me in the end is that this same footage will probably be available on a special edition DVD in the future, but it's a price I chose to pay.

Pros: Unique Packaging, Art

Cons: Nothing really new.",1139356800,,565,4.403846153846154
2424932,5,B000BMSUJK,"This is a reminder/recommendation to Kong fans to buy/rent/watch the movie ""MIGHTY PEKING MAN"". Its a tribute to KING KONG. (Some might say rip-off but its too good for that.)  Its just a really clever and spirited monster movie and well worth the time of any monster fan to check it out.

It has a sort of giant chinese Kong creature captured in the mountains and put on exibit in Hong Kong. He breaks free to rescue his best friend,a sexy blonde ""Sheena"" type jungle girl. There is mass destruction and battles galore.  Excellent stuff and a real neat looking ape man.",1138233600,,570,4.568627450980392
2424933,5,B000BMSUJK,"Peter Jackson's Diaries are more ""personal"" in nature than I expected.  The director gives us a complete account in the making of his masterpeice, KING KONG.  After seeing this 2 DVD set, Jackson really lets you in on his ambition and never wavering passion.  We feel he wants to share with you his innermost feelings and thoughts on all apsects of his grandiose vision.

If one word has to sum up Pete Jackson it is this: PERFECTIONIST.  We're really watching a master at work who never lets one small detail go unnoticed.  The only director I can think of that had this much masterful planning, perfectionistic mindset, and pure creative vision is the late Stanley Kubrick.

Unequivocally, Pete Jackson is one of the great directors of all time and this DVD sheds profound light on his charming personality (he doesn't direct with heavy handed martinet control) and his relentless work ethic.  What I really enjoyed watching this was the rare opportunity of seeing a genius at work.",1137110400,7,984,4.850299401197605
2424934,5,B000BMSUJK,"After the smashing success of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy the question on everyone's mind was how does director Peter Jackson rival his phenomenal achievement? The answer: King Kong. Avid Jackson fans, however did not need to wait until December 2005 to hear from Peter Jackson again. Right at the start of principal photography of Kong in September 2004 Peter treated his fans to little online production diaries chronicling the making the epic King Kong. Every three days or so a new 5 to 8 minute clip appeared online exploring the various activities of cast and crew and their combined efforts in bringing King Kong to life. As time unfolded the diaries became increasingly complex as well as interactive with fans having questions answered regarding their fields of interest.

This DVD combines all these production diaries on a handy 2 disc set. At approximately 3.5 hrs virtually no secret remains hidden, every detail of this gigantic production is unveiled: from cast & crew to costumes, visual effects, miniature photography, cameras, sound, production design, the list goes on ... A fantastic insight into the production workflow developed on LOTR, perfected on Kong. Find out how Andy Serkis infused King Kong with a human performance that'll have Gollum pale in envy, why Peter Jackson actually never took the Venture out to sea but relied on miniatures instead and why it's better to have your own customized ""Build you own Jungle Kit"" as opposed to travelling to some exotic location. A bonus diary on the making of the Kong - T Rex fight merits a special nod here, from previz to completion actually includes a sizeable portion of ""the vine scene""

Among the many making ofs included on DVDs these days this is by far the best one yet. Leave it to Peter Jackson to set a new standard, yet again simply with his behind the scenes documentation. A must have for anyone interested in film production or merely wanting to learn more about the making of King Kong.",1136851200,8,1977,4.863501483679525
2424935,4,B000BMSUJK,"Let me start out by saying that this is one of the most informative behind-the-scenes efforts I have ever seen. The first few entries are brief, but they immediately get much better, and I learned things about filmmaking I never knew before, even after taking a course on the subject in college.

The DVDs are also set up quite nicely so that you can view the diaries by date, set location, etc. There's even a wickedly funny prank Peter Jackson pulls on the fans by announcing that he will soon be filming the two-part sequel, Son of Kong.

But none of this is original. All of these diaries have been available on the Web for about a year. Sure the DVD is much better quality, but the diaries themselves are only worth about $10. Throw in some nifty packaging, a nice but rather useless booklet, and some artwork, and now it's $30. Is this set really worth more than the movie itself will cost? The package doesn't even include the post-production diaries. Will that be another $30?

I got the set as a gift, so I certainly can't complain, but ultimately this is a pure marketing gimmick. They could have waited and added these in with the DVD (as they did with Lord of the Rings), and they certainly could have lowered the price. But they knew they could make money with it this way, and boy, were they right.",1136505600,10,1312,4.458333333333333
2424936,5,B000BMSUJK,"As for myself, one of the major themes here is that some animals - apes or other creatures of the wild - may have more humanity than what humans sometimes mistakenly view themselves as having; and that animals in general are not necessarily beyond feeling, caring, or emotion. Anyone who has ever truly bonded with the animal kingdom in abiding affection might tend to agree. Kong was driven to his acts of violence and had an entirely other protective side to his nature and even learned sign language from the beauty he loved. (The Empire State Building scene.) That's why the first version of Kong has touched the human heart and soul for over 70 years, and so may this one.

KK dies but dies with beauty and dignity. On the other hand, after his spectacular murder, the humans of culpability are left to contemplate their own greed... misguided attempts at fame... murderous exploitive instincts... and pitiful lack of conscience.... Okay, it's just a movie, but I think Kong had more character than all his other exploiters and murderers combined.

Maybe it should have been Kong shooting at the ridiculous army gunners in the name of security and justice instead of the other way around - as who makes for a sorrier figure?

KK is a major reminder of who we are as human beings - or are supposed to be - and perhaps a commentary on not only our own corruption as a species, but on our seeming war on nature - the part of nature that should be left unspoiled and entirely alone before nothing is left other than ashes and concrete; and that would be a better reflection of the higher nature of humanity rather than of the most base of human instincts portrayed in this film, and down through the centuries.

I found this an emotionally evocative tribute to the first legendary Kong film and the spirit of its grand animal protagonist... with his huge heart... and gentle hands.",1136505600,,1882,4.642642642642643

2424938,5,B000BMSUJK,"An Amazing and entertaining behind the scenes look at Universal Studios' masterpiece remake ""KING KONG"" From the first shot to the last day, Peter Jackson takes through the biggest detail to the smallest. It's the most terrific behind the scenes I've ever seen, from the smallest leave in a Skull Island jungle to the very top of the Empire State Building. With the cast and Crew all on this treasure trove, Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll and Andy Serkis performing the movements and facial expressions of ""the Eighth Wonder of the World"" ""KING KONG"" The DVD even features a behind the scenes look at the Kong and Rex battle, from the storyboard to the final results in the finished film. If your a Kong fan and movie buff like me, then most defintley buy this treasure trove. Jackson's the greatest director of our time.",1136073600,6,874,4.681818181818182
2424939,5,B000BMSUJK,"Like another reviewer noted, it would be boring for me to point out  all the great documentaries found on these two DVDs, plus the booklet and four exclusive artwork prints again.  If you are a Kong fan and love knowing how movies are made in great detail, then this is a no-brainer purchase.  My only complaint is that the large box was a real waste of manufacturing money since it is mainly full of cardboard packing for holding the small DVD notepad case and the four thin artworks.  Granted, the box is very nice to look at and has cool texturing, but totally useless in the long run.  You only need the DVD notepad case.  That's my only gripe about the set.",1135987200,3,662,4.385245901639344
2424940,4,B000BMSUJK,"As a complete film nut, I love the DVDs that have tons of behind the scenes and featurettes. If this sounds like you, this DVD set is a must have. The set follows Peter Jackson, cast and crew of King Kong through production.

And the packaging is awesome. Even though I am not that much of a fan of non-standard DVD packaging, I made an exception for this.",1135900800,5,356,4.235294117647059
2424941,3,B000BMSUJK,"I saw the movie. Enjoyed it, but there were several dull moments and several bad CGI effects. Still it is amazing to me that movies like Alien, Aliens, Jurassic Park, Terminator 2 still blow most of these new movies out the box. Not one of said movies do I ever not believe what I am looking at. However, I can't say that for King Kong. The scenes where they are running form the dinosaurs simply looks bad as in the old movies with movie screen behind them. there are other bad CGI, but I don't want to dwell on it. Overall the movie was good, but not as good as the original 1933 movie despite the outdated effects.",1135728000,,617,4.237288135593221
2424942,5,B000BMSUJK,"A lot of people have already detailed what's good about this release, so I won't repeat what they've already said.  However, having just recently seen the movie, I was delighted to find the entire ""vines"" part of the T-Rex fight included in its entirety at the end of the second DVD.  It was one of my very favorite parts of the movie, so it was cool to be able to watch it again at home.  As for the rest of the DVD, it's a film nerd's dream look at the making of a blockbuster movie like King Kong, richly detailed and presented with a good deal of humor.  (The April 1st production diary is great!)

Recommended for anyone who enjoyed the film and wondered how they put it together.",1135382400,7,685,4.27906976744186
2424943,5,B000BMSUJK,"This is the media journal for the making of one of the most awe-inspiring movies ever made.

The set follows the 6-month production process, with DVDs loaded with footage of the process and interviews, art prints and written memoirs.  Suspense is upheld, as not much of the film itself is revealed.

This set is geared toward the collector, but if you're interested in how large-budget movies are made - or if you just love Kong, you'll love this set.

Highly recommended.",1135036800,8,472,4.790123456790123

HEY SSEES Student

Look at this way, peter jackson did Bryan Singer a favor by calling him to help him out because we all know that king kong is going to do much better than superman returns. Why you don't tell everybody that Bryan Singer wanted to steal some production crew from peter jackson set. Plus it's peter jackson,

i don't think bryan singer would have did it for any body else he know how good peter is, did he ask him to do it for LORD OF THE RINGS......",1134950400,,610,4.380530973451328
2424945,4,B000BMSUJK,"In order to capitalize on the release of Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong, Universal has released a collection of production diaries on a 2-DVD set. These brief segments originally aired on Kong is King, a fan website dedicated to the movie. It was Jackson's attempt to show that despite the ambitious scale of the production, he was still accessible to his loyal fanbase. These segments, averaging two to three minutes in length, document the 131 day shoot that lasted from September 6, 2004 to April 8, 2005. Their purpose was two-fold: to build anticipation by providing glimpses of Jackson's take on Kong and insight into the filmmaking process (much as he did on The Lord of the Rings special edition DVDs). He even took questions from fans on what they wanted to see on these diaries.

Their relatively short duration makes them easily digestible and on the DVD you can either view them in chronological order or by shooting location. Some of the cast join in on the fun, joking around on the set and getting into the spirit of it all. More importantly, these diaries shed light on the unsung aspects of the production that aren't usually documented in making of featurettes.

One of the most fascinating aspects is how Jackson created 1930s New York City in New Zealand. He studied period photographs and even took a tour of the Empire State Building (with actress Naomi Watts in tow). He didn't want to create a stylized New York but depict it as realistically as possible. Ultimately, they create it through a mix of actual sets, miniatures and CGI. The second disc of the production diaries focuses on the shooting that took place on the New York City sets, providing snap shots of various aspects, like extras, dressing up the sets, the vehicles and so on.

So, why should you buy this set if you've already downloaded them all off the `Net? Well, the resolution of the segments is much better and you also get the discs contained in an attractive, collectible package with certified artwork from the movie. The key to these production diaries is to show enough footage to pique curiousity but not reveal too much and ruin the experience of seeing the finished film in theatres. They have succeeded and this set provides something to hold over fans until the inevitable, exhaustive special edition DVD is released.

One segment that did not air on the `Net was ""The Making of a Shot: The T-Rex Fight."" It's a substantial look at how they put together the exciting scene where Kong fights a family of Tyrannosaurus Rexes all the while trying to save Ann Darrow (Watts). This featurette goes from concept art to animatics to an actual clip from the finished film.",1134691200,28,2675,4.758620689655173
2424946,4,B000BMSUJK,"When Merian C. Cooper unleashed his ""King Kong"" in 1933, he went to great lengths to safeguard the secrets behind its mind-bending special effects. Peter Jackson, ringmaster of the new century's ""Kong,"" had other ideas. ""Why don't we invite people in"" as the movie is being made, the director mused back in 2004. And so an ambitious series of behind-the-scenes shorts went up on the movie's Web site, more or less in real time. ""It was an experiment,"" Jackson says. ""It's not a calculated piece of publicity. It's actually just the filmmakers connecting with the fans.""

The 54 shorts no longer exist on KongisKing.com -- they've been replaced by a similar post-production series. The original series migrated to DVD the day before the new ""Kong"" opened, giving viewers the unusual option of watching a hit film's DVD extras just as it premieres. Jackson plays host throughout, taking time to explain what's happening on the ""Kong"" set in New Zealand even when he's so tired he's stumbling. ""We didn't try to hide anything,"" a seriously slimmed-down Jackson says in the intro. ""We didn't censor ourselves.""

Some of the actors love hamming it up for the fans, such as Jack Black and ""King Kong"" Andy Serkis. ""I can't believe they get to see me in costume and makeup,"" Black says early on. ""Isn't that verboten?"" Leading lady Naomi Watts seems dubious, but comes around in the series' second half.

The shorts aren't all that different from most well-made production featurettes, but few projects have looked into this many corners of the filmmaking process or spent 3 1/2 hours doing it. Everyone from Jackson to the woman who brews coffee takes a turn explaining what they do and how they feel about it. Some of the segments are full of detail -- say, the piece on how movie cameras work. Others are just goofy -- the visit with the guy who crafts fake animal poop.

The giant ape stayed under wraps when the shorts were on the Web but he makes a dramatic appearance on the DVD. ""The Making of a Shot: The T-Rex Fight"" spends 15 minutes on what it took to create the complex scene, and then rolls the frantic final product.",1134604800,11,2124,4.716981132075472

8089108,5,B000BMSUJK,"When I heard that the King Kong Production Diaries do not duplicate material in the Extended Editions' extra features and discovered that they were not available anywhere online, I ordered this set right away.  (It was only available 2nd hand from Hastings; arrived in like-new condition, even down to the packaging.)  I am a great fan of the Appendices to Peter Jackson's Middle-earth movies and, while the King Kong Production Diaries don't have the in-depth discussion or polish of those Appendices, the are nevertheless a great collection of five-star enjoyment.

The Production Diaries are just what their name implies:  Short segments made every few days throughout the production of Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of King Kong.  They cover all the good stuff, the plotting, writing, planning, filming, and fiendishly challenging special effects.  They're just what I wanted to round out the whole King Kong experience.

The package is an awkward size and shape but the clipboard had contains the DVD's happens to be just the right size to sit on the shelf next to the DVD'd and Blu-rays of the King Kong movies.  The main box, designed to resemble a steamer trunk, sits on a different shelf with other odd-shaped movie memorabilia.

Secondly, the box that the DVD's come in is beautiful and you can see the great care and talent that went into designing the packaging. It has a very 30's style, and looks like it certainly belongs in Peter Jackson's KONG universe. Upon opening, the rest is just as amazing. One of my favorite parts has to be the Certificate of Authenticity, with the numbered print of the box. It also includes a couple of Conceptual Art Prints from the movie, which look great, framed in any movie buff's room. The DVD case itself includes a booklet with pictures of the cast, crew and overall production, with superimposed text describing all of the production diaries themselves. Lastly, the Production Diaries are fantastic as well. They have very good video quality even if not Blu-Ray (they weren't filmed in HD in the first place), and include a wealth of information for anyone interested in the making of the movie, or the movie-making process in general. The DVD menu is delightful with a very KONG-style. Overall, it it an extremely fantastic set for the making of Peter Jackson's KING KONG.
