8281595,1,B001B2GOKG,I made the mistake of buying 3 dvd's by Franco in 2015. They are all poorly produced and have unrealistic instruction. Some techniques are so terrible it should be obvious they wouldn't work. I should have done some research on this guy before ordering instead of believing all the glowing reviews.,1483574400,,298,4.862745098039215
8281596,2,B001B2GOKG,Poorly done. I didn't like it.,1476576000,3,30,4.166666666666667
8281597,2,B001B2GOKG,"Simple stuff, not what I thought or expected from Sammy. This is a pass DVD, or waste your money.",1442620800,2,97,4.157894736842105
8281598,5,B001B2GOKG,"Good lessons to learn how to escape from the attackers when threatening. Unfortunately there is a fine line between an attacker and a victim depending on a question: ""Who starts a fight?"" . This video explains carefully how to protect yourselves being justified through self defense. Highly recommendation for those who wants to learn to protect themselves. Need a good partner willing to share those practices with each other.",1415232000,,427,5.202898550724638

8281600,5,B001B2GOKG,Sammy franco is a very good instructor. Easy to follow. Always buy for my partner who is a security guard and he raves about it. He wants the whole series!!!,1415145600,,157,4.266666666666667
8281601,5,B001B2GOKG,"Being grabbed on the street is a very real and very scary possibility. Sammy Franco gives you the tools and techniques to not only survive this violent attack, but make sure the attacker remembers this encounter for a very long time! Escape Master is a must-have for everyone! Thank you, Sammy!",1415145600,,294,4.784313725490196
8281602,3,B001B2GOKG,"This is a good DVD.  I hold a black belt in Goju Ryu, and the techniques shown seem very reasonable.  Mr. Franco obviously has experience and skill and he has a good sense of realism in his approach to self defense.

The production quality is essentially that of a home video.  The lighting is good and the techniques can be seen clearly.  I feel that there is an excessive amount of repetition where Mr. Franco's students do the same technique over and over again with no real changes in the scenario, and so no real value to that much repetition.

There is also a considerable amount of foul language used throughout the video.  Perhaps Mr. Franco feels that this contributes to developing the sense of realism in encounters that may happen on the street.  However, for me, the extent of the use of this language was such that I didn't feel comfortable viewing the DVD with other family members in the room.

So, in general, good material on the DVD, good and useful techniques, and good to see these techniques from Mr. Franco's perspective given his obvious level of experience and skill.  So, I recommend the DVD from this perspective.  But the production value could have been more professional, thus the three stars.",1262649600,6,1223,4.694835680751174
8281603,5,B001B2GOKG,"Being grabbed is a very real scenario for every human that has ever lived. We learn to grab as children, before we learn to walk. We grow up, and people use this simple concept to rule through intimidation. You don't need training to grab people, to hold onto someone, as it is wired into us.

Many training systems teach how to punch and kick, but don't even consider the real need for tuition like this DVD offers us. The trouble is that we seldom get taught how to 'escape' the grabs, the grips, the holds we all have the ability to use on others. They train for trophies and fitness, not for our real needs. Here, Sammy Franco gives you all the advice and skills to never be a victim of grabs and holds again. All tuition provides differential responses based on need (using the MAP system), so you can be sure to use the required response that fits the scenario you find yourself in.

I have shared the wisdom of ""Escape Master"" with my family. Do it for yourself, do it for your family. Get this DVD! 6 Stars.",1239235200,4,1015,4.336842105263158
8281604,5,B001B2GOKG,"The escapes shown in this DVD are the same locks, chokes and holds that punks and bullies have been putting people in for generations. Escape Master taught me how to get out of these scary situations in a way that anyone get learn. Not all of us can be action heros and you don't have to be to pull these off. Having watched this DVD, I now know that if I were put in one of the common holds, I would know what to do to escape.

This DVD is filmed very well, and shows you the techniques very carefully and thoughtfully. There will be no confusion. Other self-defense products that I have bought in the past were difficult to follow or required a foundation in a specific martial art, but anyone can implement these awesome techniques!",1214265600,7,735,4.364963503649635
