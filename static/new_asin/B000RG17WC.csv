8200453,5,B000RG17WC,"A one hour long video by Grand Master Jong Soo Park. The visual quality is good and easy to watch. The instruction on various self-defense moves is easy. The number of self-defense applications is plentiful, and easy to grasp. You don't need to be a trained martial artist to benefit from this video. You will need another person to practice with, and practicing will be important. I didn't see any defense against weapons in this video, contrary to the content blurb. Nevertheless, several of the moves can be useful in a limited set of weapons assaults. This video would make a useful idea-starter for a martial arts instructor to enhance their classes with a section for self-defense - there's enough material here to last through quite a few class sessions! The DVD will also make a nice gift for your favorite karateka. I happily recommend the DVD.",1477958400,,853,4.809523809523809

8200456,2,B000RG17WC,I was hoping to get something to get my son more excited about practicing Tae Kwon Do at home.  This is a poor quality video that wouldn't even hold my attention.  There is lots of good information I am sure but it wasn't worth the price I paid for it.,1413763200,3,252,4.02

8200458,5,B000RG17WC,"This is an excellent DVD. I am just a beginner but he demonstrates and explains things very well. He's a little hard to understand, but what you can't hear explained he makes up for in demonstration. I do have to feel sorry for the guy he practices on though. He was getting pretty bruised up, poor guy. I bet he won't volunteer for that job again!",1362268800,,348,4.287878787878788
