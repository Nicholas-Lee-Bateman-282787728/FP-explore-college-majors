7829739,5,6302689295,Excellent serial from Republic studios and had the added  feature of having Clayton Moore as its co-star. Its very fast paced and action galore -highly recommend !,1392854400,,163,5.037037037037037
7829740,5,6302689295,"Another great  Republic serial, There was action  galore -and Clayton Moore dis-playing all the traits that would serve him well in just a few more months as The Lone Ranger for  the next four decades. Not much of it has really anything to do with Jesse James- its really all about Clayton for me.",1389312000,,297,4.462962962962963
