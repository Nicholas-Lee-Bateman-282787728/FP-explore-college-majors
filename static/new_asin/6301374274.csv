326394,5,6301374274,"This is one of the few Abbott and Costello movies where they don't work together as buddies. The movie starts with the revolutionary war and then jumps to modern times, the 40's.  Costello is a Ghost and Marjorie Reynolds is Melody Allen, two patriots who are killed by mistake by General Washington's forces, who mistake them for traitors to the American cause.  They have to prove to the living they are not traitors but Patriots and what follows is a very funny movie.  The special effects are very impressive for a movie made in the 40's.  The floating objects,  a car that drives by itself and ghosts passing through walls. None of the comedy is dated and the jokes still work today.  I have always liked this movie.",1419379200,9,721,4.59375

326402,5,6301374274,This is a great old movie that is a little different than the slapstick that Abbot and Costello is known for. Their is a strong  plot and not so much of the falling and tripping etc. It is a wonderful story shown in black and white. The copy that I received has a clear and sharp picture.,1365638400,5,288,4.052631578947368

7811180,5,6301374274,"In THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES (1946), we take a trip in ye olde way-back machine, to be introduced to Cuthbert Greenway (Bud Abbott) and Horatio Prim (Lou Costello), two rival gents, during the days of the Revolutionary War. Horatio is undermined in his affections for a chambermaid, by a jealous Greenway. Meanwhile, a plot is afoot, involving treason. A woman named Melody Allen, tries to help Horatio. Due to clandestine circumstances beyond their control, Horatio and Melody are wrongfully accused of being traitors and put to an untimely demise, forthwith! Returning as ghosts, the two set out to clear their names. Unfortunately, they'll have to wait a while, as they've been cursed as well, and must forever remain on the property of the manor where they met their doom! Fast-forward to 1940's New England, and the old manor has been restored, and occupied by new tenants, including direct Greenway descendant, Dr. Ralph Greenway (Abbott, of course). Can our spirited specters find what they need, without scaring the newbies to death? THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES is easily one of Bud and Lou's best films. This is even more of a fete, since they have very little screen time together. It's pretty much Lou's movie, and he pulls it off brilliantly! Highly recommended...",1498867200,2,1270,4.967136150234742

7811185,2,6301374274,"The Time of Their Lives

This film is set in 1780 Kings Point NY during the Revolutionary War. A servant is in love with Horatio the tinker, who has to pay her bond to free Nora from service. Tom Danbury expects to have a title if the war ends; he is working with Benedict Arnold to surrender West Point to the British. Maid Nora hears their plans and is abducted. When Horatio and Melody Allen try to escape, they are mistaken for traitors and shot. The General curses their burial spot. The abandoned Danbury mansion is burned to the ground. Then time passes to the current day.

The Danbury mansion has been rebuilt to be as it was some 160 years earlier. Horatio and Melody discover the magic of electricity as they haunt the house. Emily the maid hears the ghosts; she is psychic. The two ghosts search for the missing document to prove their loyalty as true patriots. The inhabitants of the house are awakened by the noise. Is the new house haunted by the past? The special effects are amusing. Something supernatural seems to be happening. Modern science says seances don't work. Yet they hear knocks on the table in response to their questions!

The voice of Tom Danbury comes from Emily and tells about a secret drawer with the missing letter. They figure out it was the library clock but there is a problem here. Dr. Greenway takes action to solve the problem, but there is a complication. There are comic scenes using the technology of those days. Then a happy ending as their curse is ended. Are the legends always true?

The political viewpoints underlaying this story may make it the least comic of all the Abbott & Costello films. Bud and Lou are opponents, they do not work as a team. Can any long-lost document ever cause history to be rewritten?",1436745600,,1763,4.569620253164557
