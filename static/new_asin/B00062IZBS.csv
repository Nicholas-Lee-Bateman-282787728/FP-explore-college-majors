8037241,5,B00062IZBS,"The netflix description (perhaps from the box cover):
""Three young friends -- Yamaguchi (Ysuke Kubozuka), Ichikawa (Rikiya) and Kosugi (Sudo Genki) -- are committed to ridding their neighborhood of corruption. So, when they meet neo-Nazi gang boss Aota Shuzo (Yoshio Harada), it seems unlikely the boys would want anything to do with him. Yet they're drawn to him and his lifestyle, and slowly get sucked into an underground world of sleaze. Will the trio succumb to the gang's dangerous ways?""

  The title means 'Madness in Bloom' (or perhaps the 'madness of the cherry blossom'). What a good movie this was. Be sure to watch to the end of the credits.
  I suppose what the title could mean, is this is about how even deeply couragous people can be led into traps (or spiders' parlors. Interesting that spiders always know to build by drafts of fresh air.).

this includes spoiler pics (so you might enjoy it more if you just plunge right in...) It's true the subs leave something to be desired (sometimes leaving altogether) but it doesn't matter much.

  As an aside, apparently the main characters names mean, respectively, complaint of the mountain (the leader of the group), one-river, and excessive justice or loyalty. The mob-boss' name Aota means blue/green ricefield. Saburo could mean 'indifferent-furnace'. (this part, of course, is highly speculative) Shibuya is the bookseller district of Tokyo(whoops, I mean Jinbo-cho, heh; Shibuya is the fashion center). People might also find it interesting that the six-pointed star (at least the uncopywritten version) is said to mean space, while the swastika (or manji(10,000, or infinity (as in Lao-Tzu's 'named thing')) is said to mean time(& my thanks for yours, jaa ne!).
Edit: Actually the symbol in question is a tomoe, the Japanese triskelion, which is said to represent the third eye, on which there is much material here: [....]
edit2: o, sakura - 'cherry tree' is written with the characters of a tree with a blossom falling onto the character of woman. o is phonetically related to ""authority"" or ""king"".

ps. If you like this, you might also enjoy the film ""Three Yakuza"".",1241395200,,2146,5.03954802259887
