5528316,3,B00AYGVCCK,"Hemel is Heaven but Hemel is far from heavenly. She has an issue with intimacy, unable to relate on any level but sexually. This drama tracks her through a number of one night stands and follows her one close relationship, her father. Sadly, Amazon's version has drifting opaque windows to block our view of genitalia. If the director/editor had intended this, a small change in camera angle could have accomplished the same thing. I found it as annoying as the smartphone user sitting in front of me in a dark theater or even as bad as putting a fig leaf on a Rodin sculpture. I've seen a huge number of films but not this form of censorship for about 30 years.",1365638400,190,662,4.479338842975206
5528317,4,B00AYGVCCK,"There would be much to say about this provocative movie...if I knew its ultimate theme.
And provocative it is!
In the first scene, Hemel (startlingly beautiful, though extremely skinny!), played by Hannah Hoekstra, speaks of ""c--ts"" and the feminist take on shaving pubic hair.
After a couple of more guys pass through her world in the night, the one man who means the most to her, her father Gijs (Hans Dagelet). enters the picture.
He is always with a woman, and they're all young and beautiful.
(In one scene, a restaurant waiter mistakes Hemel for Gijs's wife!!)
The music, and the general tone of the movie, is somber, sad.
Hemel tells her father she saw a man commit suicide by jumping off a roof.
She wonders if she should have helped....by jumping down after him!
As I said earlier, Hemel (Hoekstra!) is almost anorexically thin!!
(I personally prefer a fleshier woman!)
She is seen peeing three times during the movie.
I mention this because, in one scene, she stands up while peeing....like a man.
In another scene, her father carries her, like a child, to the toilet, telling the just-woken Hemel ""You have to pee!"".
Is she incontinent?
Does she have a bladder problem?
Then, at the end, in a highly emotional scene, her nose begins bleeding.
Why?
Stress?
Some physical problem?
Hemel is a wonderful movie, but I give it ""just"" 4 stars for what it does NOT tell us about....Heaven!

By the way, my DVD did not play the special features section!
It's not my computer, as on all my other DVD's, I can play the special features.
But when I clicked on that section, nothing happened!!",1363305600,42,1591,4.702508960573477
5528318,5,B00AYGVCCK,"It is said that some daughters are attracted to their fathers at some point in their lives. Those kinds of feelings are rarely explored in cinema, as they are delicate issues to deal with. The unforgettable ""Hemel"" takes a sincere and penetrating approach to this facet of life, and it triumphs in every level.

Hemel (Hannah Hoekstra) -- which means heaven in Dutch -- is a gorgeous 23 year-old woman who we meet right at the beginning of the film, in a chapter called ""Genital Phase."" Here, we find Hemel with what we assume is her boyfriend, both totally naked, on a bed, somewhere before, during or after sex - or none at all. Their talk is aggressive and inflammatory, with the male lover asking Hemel, ""You don't shave, do you?"" And Hemel answering, ""Why?"", and her boyfriends telling her, ""You have a hairy c--t."" Hemel, not particularly happy, responds, ""Yes. And?"" To which her lover says, ""I'm not a bushman."" Still unhappy, Hemel tells him, ""Oh, you are a child molester."" The lover then asks, ""Ever had a mouthful of pubic hair?"" And so goes this formidable scene, a Kodak moment of real life. From then on, the movie evolves into small chapters exploring Hemel's sexual life and her close relationship with her father - she doesn't have a mother. We'll witness how Hemel deals with several lovers, always finding something wrong with them, including one Algerian man, whose tenderness bothers her. She tells him that she didn't ""like afterplay, petting after an orgasm. It's more masculine to fall sleep after sex, like lions."" She also talks harsh to and is sarcastic with her loved ones, including her father. However, it is her father that she trusts more and seems to want to imitate.

Director Sacha Polak says that ""Hemel"" is about a father and daughter who have a symbiotic relationship. This seems true as you watch the film, as you see a beautiful, conflicted young woman insecure about life and love. This is powerful, real-life filmmaking. The DVD includes interviews with Hoekstra, Polak, and screenwriter Helena Van Der Meulen; a 12-page collectible booklet; and more. (Netherlands, Spain; 2012, color, 80 min plus additional material)

5528344,4,B00AYGVCCK,"I rarely review a film based on technical issues, but what could have been a very good movie has been censored. The deliberate act of censoring is an abomination and a crime. No, not a crime on the holocaust-level by any means, but history shows that there were book-burnings during appalling periods in human history. There are other reasons to be dissatisfied. The sudden inflation of rental costs are so close to the purchase prices that users are enticed into spending much more for items or services that were once included. The cold rule of thumb in corporate economics begins with giving customers quality at reasonable prices and in ample quantities. Later, it evolves raising the prices, while lowering the selection, quantity and quality. The next step is to force additional and costly ""premium"" options, where the corporation can offer much less at a much higher profit margin. The censorship trend is insidious, because it benefits no one and is a means of control. It is an act of petty self-indulgence and self-righteous indignation against the customer. Censorship is in and of itself far more despicable than the censored material. These trends are contributing to a frightening new axis of supreme corporate power, which will culminate in the destruction of the individual and the deification of corporate will. Apparently, the DVD is in its original form, but for that, you gotta' pay. Anyway ... a solid 4 stars for the original work.",1452816000,7,1454,5.012396694214876

5528353,3,B00AYGVCCK,"Note: This is a review of the non rated DVD.  This film by Sacha Polak, making her directorial debut, comes by way of the Netherlands.  It deals with Hemel (Hannah Hoekstra), which translates to ""Heaven,"" a young woman of perhaps 20.  The opening scene will get your attention as the woman has just completed coitus and is enjoying the after effects.  She seems satisfied, but the man she is with wants to pick her apart, both physically and mentally.  It becomes clear she is just a sex toy for him as he has a more serious relationship with another woman.

This tryst leads to many more as Hemel searches for the elusive love she evidently desires.  A beautiful woman with a slender model-like figure she settles for unattractive men, brutal men or married men.  The only man she's ever loved is her father, Gijs (Hans Dagelet), a distinguished executive at Christies Auction House.  Gijs has raised Hemel by himself after Hemel's mother committed suicide when she was a child.  He's also had his share of romantic affairs, nearly all of which were condemned by his daughter.

It is clear that Hemel is jealous, especially now that her father seems to have found ""the one.""  Rifka Lodeizen plays Sophie, a protg of Gijs at the auction house.  To be honest, there isn't much to the movie beyond that.  Well, except for the sometimes uncomfortable relationship between the father and daughter including a couple that border on incestuous.  Hemel has issues to be sure, but professional help never seems to be in the discussion.  Hoekstra gives a strong performance as she manages to exude some sympathy for her unlikeable character during quiet contemplative moments in her life.  Nudity aplenty, so be forewarned.",1426118400,3,1714,4.855172413793103

5528357,4,B00AYGVCCK,"Sexual gratification, without the commitment, appears to be the lead character's mission.  As the plot unfolds, you realize that there is more to Hemel than something as simple as that.

Let's talk about the censored version first.  The censored version is what you get if you bought the streaming media from Amazon.  However, if you buy the DVD, as I did, you will not have to worry about censored content.  This review is about the DVD, the uncensored movie.

The movie follows the life of a young lady who pursues sexual gratification for its own sake.  She is not interested in forming relationships with her bed partners.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this, as quite a lot of men do the same thing and are viewed differently under traditional values.  What is fascinating about her is the relationship that she has with her father.  The movie is Dutch, with English subtitles.  However, you do get enough understanding of the story to know that she is in love with her father.  Not necessarily in a sexual way, but definitely is possessive.

The reason for the casual sexual encounters is simply to fulfill her needs.  But clearly her heart is not in it, only her genitalia.  In other words, the encounters are simply for sex.  At some point in the story, it becomes clear that the father will be committing to a relationship with his girlfriend.  At that point, Hemel is emotionally upset.  Even to the point of contemplating jumping off the roof of a building.

The star of the movie is the beautiful Dutch actress, Hannah Hoekstra.  I reviewed another one of her movies, ""App"", earlier this year.  While I enjoyed ""App"" more than I did this one, ""Hemel"" is still a fascinating movie to watch.

While watching this, I was thinking about another film I had seen, Something About Anna, or something like that. This film was a lot more conservative and it worked well. She was the ultimate Social butterfly for sure. Still not sure if her character was supposed to be likeable or not. I saw one review that  said that Hannak Hoestra appeared to tbe be anorexic.

There are some erotic movies or romantic movies with erotica in it or porn movies that has some story line; all of these movies you may want to watch with your partner. Hemel is not one of those movies. It has full frontal nudity ( male and female) but not sex act. Without nudity, what you may call sex scene would get PG-13. next thing to mention is the subject of the movie, the story line and conversations between character. it is nude, blunt, vulgar. it could get R rating based on language. And father-daughter relationship portrait as border line, platonic level incest. Mostly from daughter's perspective. Then and an unexplain scene in the movie. While she is sleeping, calls her dad- by the way she never called him Dad, father or any other version of it but by his name- when he comes in her room. he says"" you need to pee ( out of no where, really) and picks her up, carries her to bathroom.

5528377,3,B00AYGVCCK,"The DVD was delivered on time and in good condition as promised. That being said, when viewed it was a huge disappointment. Foreign films can suffer two types of error -- the obvious translation / subtitle error and the other error not limited to foreign films: a lack of coherence in the scripting.

Early in the film we see the young Hemel going on a bed-hopping spree that for the most part satisfies her physical needs, but leaves her emotional development needs unmet.  The director makes it clear from the explicit nature of the couplings that tab A indeed goes into slot B.  OK but the adult audience knows this already.

There is almost an antiseptic aspect in play in that while the scenes are explicit, there is not much of an erotic atmosphere generated. It is difficult for the actors and the director to pull this off but they manage to do so.  One suspects that this was intended to ward off overeager censors and convince them that it is necessary for the film.  I got the uncensored version by the way.

We get this much:  Hemel is a girl having more than her share of problems moving into womanhood. She grew up without her mother, and she has attached too strongly to her father. (The story leaves the viewer to decide if any incest is / was involved). Hemel's father brings home several attractive women home to live with him as long as their relationship lasts and it is clear on some primal level that Hemel sees them as competition.

But after figuring out the above, one is left with a what does all this mean?  What is next?  Hemel is a film that doesn't hold together.",1380067200,2,1593,4.477508650519031

5528386,4,B00AYGVCCK,"The movie is confusing at time and you have really have to follow very closely to get tot he point.  At times its about a father/ daughter relationship bordering on sexual incest, at other its about a young woman who will sleep with any man, at  other its about a young woman attempting to define her boundaries in life by using sex, and at other i'ts just endless drivel.",1370822400,,372,4.3768115942028984
5528387,1,B00AYGVCCK,"I purchased this Video from Amazon, but was so distracted by the pixelated windows blocking the genetalia that I deleted it after 10 minutes.
If Amazon is going to offer altered product for sale they should clearly label it as having been doctored, censored or altered from it's original condition.
I must say however that this is the only instance of dissatisfaction I've had in dealing with Amazon.",1370217600,201,400,4.897058823529412

8559206,3,B00AYGVCCK,"Yeah, the sex (in the uncensored version, is great.  But, the character, Hemel, is so shallow and trivial, that is difficult to see how anyone would want to be her friend.  A quick pick-up, sure,  In fact, she is every man's fantasy, and fear:  a woman who aggressively looks for men.  That is fine, but the men in the movie want to be more than a roll in the hay.
