8177466,5,B000NE6K16,"Wife got me tickets to a Buckethead show at the Norva in VA Oct 2008 before I deployed to Afghanistan for 6 months and he was the opening act.  I never heard him before and didn't think much of it, man am I glad I didn't skip it.  This guy is absolutely amazing!  I don't know how he does it or creates the sounds that I heard but it was honestly mind blowing.  I love people with talent not all this new MTV stuff and this guy is it.  I immidiately bought the two albums they had there and the wife got a shirt, I'm buying is new/old album before he had the magic pipe to see what he was like but I've read up on him an he's nothing but talented.  Great find and really humble guy keep making great music and yes you can buy this on his website for $20, I took video with my phone but it was horrible since it was a smartphone so I hope this DVD brings back great memories.",1234742400,2,874,3.9096045197740112
