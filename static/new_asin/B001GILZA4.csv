8460343,5,B001GILZA4,"Well, as i am a Brother i must say that this VHS is the best Video about the Masonic Fraternity that i have seen. It's so real and honest, it paints a picture that attempts to inspire not only brothers but potential candidates and that is what we need, to take a good man and make him better! I wish this tape was availbe on DVD. Really all i can say is watch it for yourself and you won't be disappointed!",1266624000,4,406,4.0246913580246915
