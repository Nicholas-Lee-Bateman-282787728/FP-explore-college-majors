3042605,5,B000ZM1MJG,"The Criterion Collection has now released LUBITSCH MUSICALS, an absolutely delightful 4-disc boxed set that contains a quartet of director Ernst Lubitsch's very risque' musical-comedies that he made for Paramount between 1929-1932.

Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald each star in three of the films.  Interestingly, although the performers make an engaging couple on screen, the fact is that they did not like working together.  When it came to doing THE MERRY WIDOW at MGM in 1934, Chevalier felt double-crossed by Lubitsch, because the director had promised him that MacDonald would not be in the picture, then reneged.

The movies in this collection are definitely dated, but they are still a lot of fun to watch.  Being a Chevalier fan, my only disappointment is the fact that none of his three films contain any of his ""signature songs"".  What's even more baffling is that in THE LOVE PARADE (1929), MacDonald's character is named ""Louise,"" which makes one wonder why ""Louise,"" Chevalier's most famous song, was not included in that score.

THE LOVE PARADE, Lubitsch's first talking picture, like THE SMILING LIEUTENANT (1931), has Chevalier cast as a ladies man who winds up marrying royalty.  In the earlier film, it's MacDonald, the Queen of Sylvania, who wins his heart, while in the later picture, Princess Mariam Hopkins steals him away from cafe' entertainer Claudette Colbert.

Also in the cast of THE LOVE PARADE is Lillian Roth, who was the real-life subject of the award-winning Susan Hayward movie, I'LL CRY TOMORROW (1955).
 MONTE CARLO (1930) could easily have been another Chevalier/MacDonald pairing, because the two leading roles are not dissimilar from those in THE LOVE PARADE.  However, in this film, British theater veteran Jack Buchanan (THE BANDWAGON) takes on the Chavalier role, pretending to be a hairdresser in order to gain access to Countess Jeanette's bedroom.

ONE HOUR WITH YOU (1932) is my personal favorite in this collection.  In it, Chevalier and MacDonald play a happily married couple, and Genevieve Tobin plays Jeanette's best friend, who tries to steal Maurice away from her.

Chevalier's song ""What Would You Do?"" is the film's musical highlight.

There are no DVD extras in this set, but each movie is accompanied by some extensive and interesting liner notes.

3042612,5,B000ZM1MJG,"Ernst Lubitsch is the great director who pretty much invented the sophisticated, adult film comedy, but he also pretty much invented the film musical as we now know it. I saw the first and most famous of these 4 films, THE LOVE PARADE, on TCM a while ago, and I immediately looked for a DVD of it, but there wasn't one until now. The wonderful folks at Criterion have put Lubitsch's 4 early musicals together in one great package, and it is delightful. It is also an important chapter in the history of film. LOVE PARADE (1929) was the first full-length sound film with songs incorporated into the story, and it was such a big hit that Paramount followed it up with the other 3 in this collection.

Just about every musical film director owes something to Lubitsch, from the early sound period right up to the present. Watch these 4 movies, and you will see the earliest examples of a whole lot of musical film conventions that we now take for granted. You'll also see great performances by Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, Jack Buchanan, Claudette Colbert, and Miriam Hopkins. And you'll find out where several famous songs were first introduced, including ""Dream Lover,"" ""Give Me A Moment, Please,"" and ""Beyond the Blue Horizon."" Who knew? I sure didn't--but I'm glad I found out. Any fan of film history--especially musicals--should find this collection fascinating. Highly recommended.",1202947200,,1395,4.911016949152542
3042613,4,B000ZM1MJG,"This collection of pre-code Ernst Lubitsch comedy/musicals is a welcome addition to the gems which continue to appear on DVD. Ernst Lubitsch was the master of the bedroom comedy, with a famous and recognisable touch towards matters sexual which became the benchmark for many famous directors, notably Billy Wilder.

""The Love Parade"", released in 1929, became the prototype of the Lubitsch musical which culminated with ""The Merry Widow"" in 1934, to which it has many similarities. The film stars the debonair Maurice Chevalier as an ambassador who marries luminous Jeanette Macdonald, queen of Sylvania, in her film debut. Macdonald became for a brief time the queen of the bedroom farce, long before MGM paired her with Nelson Eddy and systematically removed her sense of fun. In this film, her makeup obscures her lush beauty but no one could match her balance of sexinesss and insouciance. The film broke away from the backstage conventions of the early talkie musicals and contributed significantly to the liberation of the camera from the inertia which talkies initially brought. The print is very good.

As a follow up, Macdonald was starred in 1930 in ""Monte Carlo"" with the British Jack Buchanan who is no Chevalier. Buchanan has an effeminate quality which detracts from the romance. The plot is a take off of Monsieur Beaucaire, a countess falling in love with a count impersonating her hairdresser. The best moment is the staging of MacDonald in a train singing ""Beyond the Blue Horizon"", a song she kept in her repertoire for the rest of her life. The film is a showcase for her and she is animated and funny. The print is generally excellent but the soundtrack comes and goes at times as the actors move away from the microphone.

In 1931, ""The Smiling Lieutenant"" brings back Chevalier in another marital musical farce whereby he is mistaken for flirting with dowdy princess Miriam Hopkins and ordered to marry her to avoid an international scandal. Claudette Colbert plays his saucy girlfriend, a violinist with an all girl band. Colbert eventually meets the princess, takes pity on her and teaches her  to ""jazz up her lingerie"" to attract Chevalier. The film is filled with visual tricks, smutty innuendo, particularly around Colbert's ability with her hands, and some lively songs. Colbert reveals an adequate singing voice. All the leads are terrific and the print is really excellent.

""One Hour with You"" for 1932 is a remake of an earlier Lubitsch Silent and is another bedroom farce with Chevalier caught between wife Jeanette MacDonald and her girlfriend Genevieve Tobin, in rhyming couplets. The film in fact was originally directed by George Cukor but Lubitsch was not satisfied with the results and apparantly reshot much of the footage. There are some charming songs and, once again, lots of sexy innuendo. MacDonald is radiant here and her scenes with the superb Tobin are hilarious. Charles Ruggles and Roland Young are on hand too in support of the leads and are perfect as always. The print is OK.

All of these films contributed to Paramount Studios reputation as the most sophisticated of the studios. While they were critical successes, only ""The Love Parade"" really was an all out smash hit. The set is expensive but has no extras except some good notes on the inside sleeve of each DVD. This is disappointing given they are more worthy of preservation than many more famous box office hits.",1196985600,,3428,4.984265734265734
3042614,5,B000ZM1MJG,"Starting with the dawn of sound until the birth of the modern movie musical around 1934, audiences suffered through musicals that were so bad that they were cheesy such as 1930's ""Golden Dawn"" and the just plain awful such as the inexplicable ""Howdy Broadway"". A cut - or maybe two - above the rest were the musicals Ernst Lubitsch made at Paramount. This set is the debut of those musicals on DVD. They include:

The Love Parade (1929) - stars Jeanette MacDonald as the queen of a mythical country and Maurice Chevalier as her new husband, Renard. Renard, whose background has been that of a free-wheeling philanderer finds his new position as consort quite constraining. Nominated for Best Picture Oscar.

Monte Carlo (1930) - stars Jeanette MacDonald this time as a status-rich cash-poor Countess. She falls in love with someone she thinks is a hairdresser and decides to marry a wealthy member of the gentry to improve her financial position, which is desperate. However, she later finds out her hairdresser is not who she thinks he is. Enjoyable and above average, but probably the weakest of the four films.

The Smiling Lieutenant (1931) - Chevalier is back, this time in the title role. His smile, meant for his girlfriend, is intercepted by a noblewoman. He is forced into a marriage with this noblewoman. However, afterwards the girlfriend shows the new wife how to win her husband's love. This is a great precode and was nominated for Best Picture.

One Hour with You (1932) - Reteams Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier. This time Chevalier is the pursued rather than the pursuer as he is Andre, the happily married husband of Colette (MacDonald). Collette's friend Mitzi pursues Andre relentlessly, and he gives in. Likewise, Colette can't resist a man in pursuit of her. Throw in Mitzi's jealous husband, and you have Andre confessing his transgression to his wife and hoping for her forgiveness. Nominated for Best Picture.

Lubitsch was one of the few people making musicals in 1931 and 1932 because the genre was so out of favor due to early poor entries. Watch these four musicals full of great precode sauciness and sophistication and find out why the Lubitsch touch is the stuff of legends.",1195948800,,2215,4.911764705882353

8235894,5,B000ZM1MJG,"Of the four films on this Criterion Collection disk, I intend to discuss THE SMILING LIEUTENANT (1931).  It is another risqu film from famed German-born Hollywood film director Ernst Lubitsch, he of the acclaimed light touch that just made it under the wire before Hollywood's repressive Hays Code was enforced.  It is an 89-minute, black and white musical/romantic comedy, based on the operetta EIN WALTZERTRAUM (""A WALTZ DREAM""), by Leopold Jacobson and Felix Dormann.  The screenplay was written by Ernest Vajda and Samson Raphaelson.  Although the movie was Oscar-nominated, and was the biggest grossing film of 1931, it was not permitted to be re-released once the Hays Code began to be enforced.  It was, in fact, considered lost until a print was discovered in Denmark in the 1990s. The picture has an all-star cast, including several actors with which Lubitsch frequently worked, that excelled in delivering these gossamer Lubitsch valentines.  And the movie is set in that gemtlich , glamorous Mitteleuropa city, Vienna, which I have finally managed to visit recently that here, looks lovely and decorative as a wedding cake.

Winsome Lieutenant Niki of the Austrian royal guard has a new girlfriend, the pretty and charming musician Franzi. He's crazy about her and is smiling at her while on duty. Just then, King Adolf and his daughter Princess Anna from the neighboring kingdom of Flausenthurm arrive for a state visit, and Anna catches a wink directed to Franzi. She falls for Niki, marries him (he has virtually no choice in the matter), and whisks him off to Flausenthurm.  Franzi follows them and enjoys a brief rekindling of the affair with her handsome lieutenant before the Princess finds out.  Franzi, who is much more experienced than Anna in the ways of the world, gives the princess tips on how to make herself more attractive to her husband.

Lt. Nikolaus `Niki"" von Preyn is played by the invariably charming French crooner Maurice Chevalier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gigi/dp/B001NEPRX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gigi</a>).

The rhythmic underscoring of the film comments on the characters' moods; it was orchestrated by Conrad Salinger, who had been a pupil of the English composer Frederick Delius.

The film's got its share of witty lines.  Princess Anna tells Franzi, ""I don't know very much about life. I got all my knowledge out of the Royal Encyclopedia. A special edition arranged for Flausenthurm, with all the interesting things left out.""  And at one point, after King Adolf and Princess Anna proudly serve Niki the Viennese favorite dish veal schnitzel, and boast that they got the cow, as well as the recipe, from Vienna, Niki laments, ""Poor cow.

His films are suffused with subtle, subliminal sexuality: no nudity, done with innuendo, and the great deal of magnetic energy the topnotch director was able to draw from his actors.  His acclaimed ""Lubitsch touch"" is a light one.  It is best seen here, I think, in the arrival of piles of boxes to Princess Anna's palace, all bearing the names, one feels sure, of the most chic shops in Vienna.  And all containing clothing, the viewer will feel sure, recommended by Franzi, that is guaranteed to make the formerly dowdy Anna look good to her new husband.  And then there is the new sheet music, to the jazz tunes of the day.  It's no wonder Princess Anna will soon become irresistible to her formerly inattentive husband.

8235895,5,B000ZM1MJG,"Once again Eclipse has put together a unique and often unseen group of films. In the early days of sound Ernst Lubitsch was a force to be reckoned with.  Working primarily at Paramount he helped usher in the idea that a story could be told with both music and narration. His pre Hayes Code musicals are great examples of the the saucy ribald direction that Hollywood was taking prior to the 1940's

The set features four of Lubitsch's earliest musicals and all are well worth seeing. They are presented in near pristine quality for films of this age. All are presented in the intended aspect ratio that the director used. The films offer pairings with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald that produced multiple Academy Award nominations.

The first film presented is 1929's Love Parade. This film is widely considered the first Hollywood musical. Set in the fictional kingdom of Sylvania it tells the story of  a disgraced military attach who is sent home and becomes the husband of the queen. The ensuing battle of the sexes while somewhat dated is amusing even though would now be considered highly politically incorrect. Chevalier and MacDonald shine in their roles and the onscreen chemistry is fun to watch.

Monte Carlo(1930) again stars MacDonlad this time with Jack Buchanan. MacDonald stars as Countess Helene Mara who skips out on her fianc  on the day of her wedding and runs off to Monte Carlo to find love with her supposed hairdresser who is actually a Count in disguise. This is perhaps the most amusing of the four films in the set and begins Lubitsch's move from the traditional musical to the more narrative screenplay structure that he would become known for in some of his later films.

The Smiling Lieutenant  (1931) stars Chevalier as  a military officer who becomes involved with two very different women: a women's band leader played by Claudette Colbert and a sexually repressed princess played by Mirian Hopkins. This film was thought lost for many years and this is a welcome treat for those with more than a passing interest in early cinema. The narrative structure becomes stronger with a screenplay written by Samson Raphaelson.

The final film of the collection is One Hour With  You (1932)  again pairing Chevalier and MacDonald as a happily married couple whose marriage begins to crumble when a friend of his wife begins an affair.  Again the story of sexual politics seems a bit dated but the amusement level stays fairly high for such an old film. This film marked the last Paramount musical that Lubitsch directed for Paramount. There was controversy over the directing credit since the project originally had been assigned to George Cukor.

These films also present the last of the sexy pre code films before the Hayes Code tried to regulate the morals of film goers. From this point on musicals would become spectacles and the linear narrative would rule Hollywood.  This set gives the viewer a good example of how things were in the early days of Hollywood",1338249600,,3001,4.8799212598425195

8235897,5,B000ZM1MJG,"I bought this series in order to see ""One hour with you"" after watching most of it on TCM a couple of weeks ago. So far, that's the only film in this set that I have watched, but it was light-hearted fun and entertainment. It's refreshing to watch films that didn't rely on the ""F"" word throughout, nor any bad language at all. Sure, the inuendos were there but they were cleverly written and presented with taste and dignity. Can't wait to see the other films because I'm sure they will be lightyears ahead in quality compared to many films released today. It's a great value and quality prints. I think it would have cost nearly as much just to purchase ""One hour with you"" as it did for this entire set; and that's if you could even find the former. Money well spent if you like classic movies.",1299628800,,797,4.355704697986577
8235898,5,B000ZM1MJG,"Highly recommended and must see films from Ernst Lubitsch. The Love Parade is the second American film of Maurice Chevalier and the first film for Jeanette Macdonald. The Love Parade features Lillian Roth and Lupino Lane who later was a sensation in Me and My Girl and introduced the Lambeth Walk. Innovative in that it successfully integrated songs and plot, this film is outstanding and features songs including ""Dream Lover,"" ""My Love Parade,"" and ""March of the Grenadiers."" It is the classic battle of the sexes featuring a Queen played by Jeanette Macdonald and her Prince Consort played by Maurice Chevalier. Monte Carlo which features the standard ""Beyond the Blue Horizon"" sung by Jeanette Macdonald co-stars Jack Buchanan, a Count in disguise as a hairdresser. Jack Buchanan a musical star who later starred in The Band Wagon with Fred Astaire is excellent with the lovely Jeanette. The Smiling Lieutenant stars Chevalier and his leading ladies are Miriam Hopkins and Claudette Colbert, both equally charming. In a mythical kingdom, Chevalier's Lieutenant falls for Colbert but in a series of misunderstandings, marries the Princess played by Hopkins. One Hour with You is a remake of Lubitsch's silent the Marriage Circle and a triangle of happily marrieds Colette and Andre and the flirtatious Mitzi. Charles Ruggles co-stars as Adolph who is smitten with Colette. Tunes include ""We will always be Sweethearts"" and ""One Hour with You."" Fans of Musicals will enjoy this set featuring pre-Nelson Eddy Jeanette Macdonald and Maurice Chevalier. Highly recommended",1271980800,,1570,5.284
8235899,4,B000ZM1MJG,"Ernst Lubitsch, before Frank Capra or Alfred Hitchcock, was the name above the title ealy movie goers could look for a specific type of entertainment, sophisticated comedy. He was as close to a star-director (think Spielberg today) in the late silent era as there was, after Chaplin. This collection of four of his first sound films are superb- especially The Love Parade (premiered two weeks after Wall St. laid an egg in 1929) and One Hour With You, which he did just before his most acknowledged masterpiece, Trouble in Paradise. Even the mediocre Monte Carlo has its great moments- such as Jeanette MacDonald introducing 'Beyond the Blue Horizon' on her train ride to that same city. And The Smiling Lieutenant is done with those Lubitsch touches to rescue what could be a real downer of a film.",1241654400,,799,4.839416058394161
8235900,5,B000ZM1MJG,"About twenty years ago I managed to see three of the four films in this set at an Ernst Lubitsch festival and was able to see MONTE CARLO in the University of Chicago film archives. Since then I've managed to see ONE HOUR WITH YOU, one of my favorite Lubitsch films, one on AMC (back when it showed classic films) and once on TCM (after it wouldn't allow AMC to show the films it had the rights to). Although I'm only reviewing this set now, I had it preordered when it was first released. As a huge fan of Lubitsch, I had for years regretted his neglect not only on DVD but on VHS as well. This set makes several of these films available for personal ownership (unless one recorded them off TCM or AMC) for the first time. My only hope is that the rest of Lubitsch's films will also be released.

Lubitsch is one of the great masters of cinema. Andrew Sarris in THE AMERICAN CINEMA placed him and Hitchcock at the apex of the greatest directors in American cinema. He obviously also made Sarris's ""Pantheon."" Hitchcock and Lubitsch are both unsurpassed in their ability to use the camera to tell a story. Both are complete virtuosos and mastered the unique qualities of cinema that cannot be immitated by other art forms. Lubitsch can move the story along merely by showing the changing contents of a closet. Showing a clock and the changing light of day can speak volumes. And no one in the history of cinema -- especially in his pre-code films, but even afterwards as well -- could handle sex as well as Lubitsch. There is never anything lascivious or dirty about his treatment of sex, but it is always fun, mischievous, and deeply flirtatious.

These are also among the most watchable films of the early years of sound cinema. There were huge technical difficulties while THE LOVE PARADE was being made. And even MONTE CARLO and the other two films were made when many of the kinks of the sound process had not been worked out. If you watch carefully, THE LOVE PARADE frequently becomes a silent film, with music providing all of the soundtrack. But these difficulties hardly slowed Lubitsch down. Along with the Marx Brothers, most of the early sound films that we still watch with delight were largely these made by Lubitsch.

Lubitsch is unique in another way. He is the only major film figure who is simultaneously an important studio head (he was for many years until health prevented it head of production at Paramount) and one of the great directors of cinema (many rank him among the top 4 or 5 directors ever). So in making his films there was little or no conflict with the studio brass over artistic vision, simply because he was the studio brass.

I love all four of these films, though I will confess a preference for ONE HOUR WITH YOU, a film that was begun by George Cukor. All four films are dominated by Maurice Chevalier and Jeannette MacDonald, with each of them appearing in three films each, two of them with both. They also appeared together in the great THE MERRY WIDOW, one of the last pre-code films and one that desperately needs to be brought out on DVD. they also appeared in 1929 in another truly great musical, LOVE ME TONIGHT, directed by Mamoulian. If you didn't know Mamoulian directed it, you would swear Lubitsch had. Ironically, though MacDonald is best known for her films with Nelson Eddy, they cannot even remotely compare in quality with the group of films that she did with did with Chevalier.

Two of the films are scripted by Samson Raphaelson (who was pretty transparently the model for the Eli Wallach character in the recent film THE HOLIDAY, in which Kate Winslet). He wrote the screenplay for both THE SMILING LIEUTENANT and ONE HOUR WITH YOU, and would later write other major screenplays for Lubitsch such as TROUBLE IN PARADISE, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and others.

Now, while I am absolutely delighted that these films have been made available once again in the Criterion Eclipse series, I do have complaints. First, there are absolutely no special features. No commentaries, no documentaries about the films, nothing. Second, while the prints were somewhat cleaned up, they are not truly pristine. Most of the films show lots of scratches and scrapes. The pictures are not as vivid as one might wish. Still, their available at all trumps these complaints.

The four films in the set are:

THE LOVE PARADE

This was one of two great films Chevalier and MacDonald made in 1929, the other being LOVE ME TONIGHT. Though Lubitsch was the greatest comedy director in cinematic history in my opinion (though I have to confess that I'm hardly alone in that assessment), for once Mamoulian managed to top the master. THE LOVE PARADE is a very good movie, but LOVE ME TONIGHT is a masterpiece. THE LOVE PARADE features a story that is similar to many of the plots of his films: two individuals of widely differing social backgrounds or classes find love. Here a princess elevates a diplomat so that she can marry him. (Interestingly, LOVE ME TONIGHT had the same kind of tension.) The plot is thin, but the execution is delightful. There are a host of wonderful moments that shows Lubitsch at his finest. I especially loved a song where Chevalier, about to depart Paris, sings aloud his regret at leaving his lady loves. His valet then sings his regrets, and all of the servant girls come to their windows to hear him with distress. Finally, Chevalier's dog comes up to the window to bark out his sadness at leaving his lady friends, and a group of female dogs hear his lament.

THE LOVE PARADE also features a couple of fascinating supporting actors. Chevalier's valet is played by British vaudevillian Lupino Lane. He was famous for his remarkably physical style of dancing, which he puts on display here. He was the uncle of Ida Lupino. More poignantly, he is teamed with Lillian Roth, who was only 19 when this film was released. She had a great voice and a remarkable youthful beauty. Fans of the Marx Brothers will recognize her from ANIMAL CRACKERS. Although she was a major talent, she underwent a long string of personal tragedies, including alcoholism and drug addiction (much of it in reaction to major disappointments in life, such as the death of her fianc when she was in her early twenties). Eventually she managed to make a major comeback as a nightclub performer and wrote a biography that was made in to a major film, I'LL LIVE TOMORROW, which garnered an Oscar nomination for Susan Heyward. Roth was perhaps the first celebrity to publicly admit a problem with alcoholism and her openness made it possible for other troubled celebrities to get help. But seeing her in this film, so pretty and young and talented, really makes you regret that she did not have the kind of career her talent might have generated.

MONTE CARLO

This is the least of the four films included in the set, though it is still quite good. Jeannette MacDonald sang ""Beyond the Blue Horizon"" in it and it became her personal theme song for the rest of her life. But for many film fans the greatest source of delight is the presence of Jack Buchanan in the male lead. Most American film fans know him primarily for his extraordinary work in the Fred Astaire film THE BAND WAGON. This film shows that he was not a one-hit wonder and the wonderful elegance that he displayed in THE BAND WAGON is fully in evidence here.

THE SMILING LIEUTENANT

Two things that really strike me in this film are how very, very young Claudette Colbert is in it. We don't usually remember that most of Colbert's career came in her mid to late thirties, or even in her early forties. In this film she is 28 and one can see just how thin she was at that stage of her career. Though she was never a large person, she is surprisingly thin in this one, especially in her face. The other thing that struck me about her is that she hadn't yet refused to be photographed from her left profile. Here she frequently can be seen in full right profile and thinks nothing of going from one profile to another. Contrast this with THE PALM SPRINGS STORY, where she laboriously blocks her scenes to stay in left profile.

The film is also graced by the wonderful Miriam Hopkins, one of the great comic actresses of the thirties and one of Lubitsch's most frequently used stars. She was in one of Lubitsch's greatest films, TROUBLE IN PARADISE, as well as in DESIGN FOR LIVING. I was not previously aware that she played the piano, but in the scenes where she is supposed to be playing it definitely looks as if she is. If she isn't, it is one of the best jobs at pretending to that I've ever seen.

The greatest thing about this set is that it makes movies like this one available again. Although Lubitsch was impeded in his filmmaking by his duties at the studio and by ongoing health problems, it is absolutely amazing how many great movies he made. Now those who previously only knew him from NINOTCHKA and HEAVEN CAN WAIT and TO BE OR NOT TO BE and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER and TROUBLE IN PARADISE can see a great film like THE SMILING LIEUTENANT.

ONE HOUR WITH YOU

This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is also a film that couldn't possible have been made three years later, after the Code was fully implemented. It is quite naughty, about a promiscuous married female who is trying to seduce her best friends husband. She succeeds and one of my all time favorite scenes in any film comes when Chevalier, doing the walk of shame the next morning and sensing the moral disapproval of those in the film audience, asks them (us) if someone came up and did all the things that this temptress had done, what we would do? He then self-righteously proclaims, ""Well, I did, too!""

ONE HOUR WITH YOU also contains one of the strongest supporting casts of any Lubitsch film. Genevieve Tobin, Roland Young (who provides one laugh after another), and Charlie Ruggles provide one marvelous moment after another.

Interestingly, while Lubitsch was making this film he simultaneously did so in French as well. Chevalier was, of course, French, and MacDonald fluent in it. They switched some of the supporting actors with others who could speak French. I've never seen this version and don't even know whether it is available. It would have been nice if they had included it as an extra in this set. It is definitely one of the movies that I would most like to see. Many people are unaware that many Hollywood films were simultaneously filmed in more than one language. Many Laurel and Hardy shorts were also made in Spanish and can be found without too much trouble.

If you love classic cinema, this is as much as anything gets to a ""must buy"" set. Four great films by one of cinema's greatest directors focusing especially on two great stars. Sets simply don't get any more compelling than this.",1238112000,,10821,4.616744669786791
