3071193,5,B00120LPP6,"Although a list of matches have yet to be show, I can tell this product will be a hit. Although WWE sometimes releases a dvd set and chooses the worst matches available. I have alot of old vhs tapes with Perfect matches on them and I hope they use some of them. Here is a list of things that will be on the set and some that should be on the set but probably won't be on. I hear its a two disc set, so I gather about 10 or more matchs. I hope.

Expect an hour to hour and half bio on the life and times of Perfect. Im sure they won't include the reason why he was fired back in 2002 after a brief comeback. He was drunk on a flight and picked a fight with the world champion and got canned the next day. A few other wrestlers were canned from that flight. It would make a good story but I feel WWE won't put that in there. The matches will include his Summerslam 91 match against Bret Hart (hope they pick a match no one saw), the loser leaves WWE Raw match against Ric Flair, a few AWA matches. Hopefully a WCW match as well.  I also have a feeling they will put the 2002 Rumble from when he entered-he did a great job. I have a strong feeling they'll have the 93 Summerslam match against HBK as well.

What I want to see: I want to see his 90 run as IC champion. He had some great battles agaisnt Tito Santana and Kerry Von Erich; His brief return when he wrestled the likes of RVD and Stone Cold; A good match against Hogan when they fought over the world title. The one on Hulk Still Rules wasn't the best match these two had.

So theres my take on what the set should have. I cant wait to buy this set but it'll be awhile.",1204588800,3,1627,3.9361702127659575
3071194,5,B00120LPP6,"In my opinion Curt Hening was one of the most under rated Wrestlers in his time.  He made a lot of wrestlers famous including Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Randy Savage, and The Ultimate Warrior.  But funny thing is that he never got the credit he deserved for doing what he did.  The matches I want to see on here would be the matches he had with Bret since all those matches are classics in my opinion, matches he had with Savage, with Flair in the WWE and WCW.  Also if they was going to get people to talk about him they could get Bret and Flair since both of those guys spent more time with Curt then anyone other then Bobby Hennan.  I also hope they would include some of his matches he had with Hogan and Piper when they was hot.  I have a match on a tape that was pretty great between Hogan and Henning that was before the XWF.",1202169600,4,832,4.104938271604938
3071195,5,B00120LPP6,"Yup. You may not think it, or believe it, but Mr. Perfect was my favorite wrestler of WWF (world wrestling federation). Me and my sister used to watch the whole show, and we loved all the guys of that era. Hulk Hogan was like everybody's favorite. But we routed for the ""other guy."" The antihero of sorts, Mr. Perfect. When he went in the ring, everything was just perfect, even when he sometimes lost. The music, the atmosphere, the perfect man. Yup. He was the perfect wrestler.

I was saddened, and my sister was heartbroken to hear about his death. There are several good tribute videos of him on youtube. He was a hero to us, when we were kids (I am now 28 years old, my sister 26.) You need to have heroes when you are young, as well as your parents.  And we had a few. Mr. Perfect was on that list, amongst cartoon characters from various cartoons we also watched along with WWF on that time, on sky channel (British network).

Good to hear the perfect man is getting a movie, late 2008.
I just hope the movie is as perfect as he was. Because he, was perfect.",1199836800,9,1066,4.293532338308458

3071202,3,B00120LPP6,"There aren't anywhere near enough matches on here. I really hope this set isn't the last word on Mr. Perfect because I'd love to see WWE put together a set similar to what they did for Bret Hart and Ultimate Warrior. There are a ton of great matches that they didn't include here including his other great matches vs. The Texas Tornado (win or lose), his IC match vs. Ultimate Warrior,  his IC tournament finals match vs. Tito Santana (or the subsequent rematch from Saturday Nights Main Event),  his Loser leaves Raw match vs. Ric Flair, His Battle Royale win at Saturday Nights Main Event, just to name a handful. There are also a bunch of great matches vs. mid-carders like Hercules, Rugged Ronnie Garvin, Red Rooster, Jimmy Snuka, Tugboat, The Blue Blazer, Brutus Beefcake, etc, and all of this from his original run in the WWF that would be fantastic filler to push this to a 3-disc set.

Mr. Perfect helped to lay the foundation for the glamourization of the Intercontinental Championship and make it more than just a minor title. It became a counterpart to the World championship; an equal, and paved the way for great IC champs like Rowdy Roddy Piper, Bret Hart, British Bulldog, Jeff Jarrett, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, Owen Hart, Triple H, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, etc., etc.

Along with Bret Hart, Mr. Perfect was the greatest ""technician"" of the late 1980's to early 1990's and is one of the major reasons I'm such a huge fan of wrestling (at least old school wrestling) to this day and he definitely deserves the same treatment as Bret Hart and Ultimate Warrior and should get a deluxe 3-disc set with more matches on them.

I did appreciate seeing the ""Abolutely Perfect"" viginettes on this DVD. Those are still priceless.",1401408000,5,1748,4.718032786885246
3071203,4,B00120LPP6,"This was a very good DVD, but it felt rushed after his death, and I think they could have made it a little bit better. It has plenty of great stuff, but the docu-portion felt too short.",1399248000,,185,4.027027027027027

3071208,5,B00120LPP6,"I lived in the Minneapolis, MN area from the 1970s-1990s. In that time I attended many AWA events. I delighted in watching Verne Gagne, Greg Gagne, Larry ""the Axe"" Hennig, and Curt Hennig in many dramatic matches. I lost track of Curt Hennig over the years. I was saddened to hear of his untimely death.

This 2 DVD set is packaged well. Each DVD has its own ""page."" This collection was a great way to catch up on one wrestling star I remember from the 80s!",1384128000,,457,4.313953488372093

This set contains but a sample of this man's great career, but it does him justice though. The vignettes introducing his WWE character are still priceless, but funnier yet was learning just how fun of a guy he was through the documentary and outtakes. He is still greatly missed, but now his son, Joe Henning (aka. Curtis Axel) carries his father and grandfather's flame to this new generation of fans.

for free from youtube or some stream sites.",1370995200,,373,4.5

well lets get down to the nitty gritty here of what you will see classic matches and vignettes from his AWA and WWF and WCW Years early MSG Matches .Some have said the set is lacking I beg to defer on that you will see the evolution of this man to what he became from his roots on up to being Mr. Perfect.
If your a classic WWF Fan than your in for a treat classic Wrestling the way it was meant to be right here .. Do not pass this up buy it today you won't regret this buy ...",1343952000,,648,3.9166666666666665
3071216,3,B00120LPP6,"Recently I purchased this DVD set. It's a 2 disc set. It has many interviews/skits w/ Mr. Perfect and it has matches too. It's cool having all the material it has in this set. However I felt it could of came with more matches. 1 on 1,tag,ect... It just kinda lacks matches compared to other wrestling sets I've bought. Also, like nearly half the matches are against Bret ""Hit Man'' Heart. Which he's also a good wrestler, but it just feels like there are even less matches then. My 9yr old son & I enjoy watching the WWF era wrestling more than WWE wrestling. So I 've been trying to get many of the old school DVD's. Overall, if you like WWF era wrestling & wrestlers. Than I still recommend this DVD set. To buy it on Amazon for like $3.00 or less + shipping, it's worth it still. Worth adding to your collection. Just not perfect.",1331683200,,833,4.312101910828026
3071217,2,B00120LPP6,"As a fan of AWA, WCW and WWE this was a snoozer as most WWE productions now are. No commentary from Ric Flair just mostly Larry ""The AX"" Hennig going on and on about how great his son was....ugh!",1315785600,,195,4.0256410256410255
3071218,4,B00120LPP6,"This is a fantastic DVD set just for the matches alone. Its great to see the history of Kurt Hennig that I had no ideae even existed. Being Canadian I never heard of him before he was Mr. Perfect, but it was obvious from the start this guy was born to be a great wrestler. All the vingnettes of Mr. Perfect are great too, if not cheesy as hell. The only problem I had was the interviews, outside of his family members, were more for the character of Mr. Perfect and less for the person he was, Kurt Hennig. It would have been nice to have them comment more on the real guy not the WWF/E character. Still, a fantastic DVD set and a must have for any Mr. Perfect, or old school wrestling fan!",1313625600,,690,4.118518518518519
3071219,5,B00120LPP6,"Out of all the WWE releases I own this is one of my favorites. Since I was a kid I always liked the heels and Curt Hennig was one of the greatest. He didn't need to scream and holler or back attack an opponent. He didn't even need to cheat. He did it in the ring with perfection. I cheered him when he and the genius feuded with hulk hogan while my friends booed me. I cheered him when he beat babyface after babyface when he was IC champ while my friends booed me. I was ecstatic when he slammed ric flairs head with the cage door while everyone else was bummed. He had it all and so does this 2 disc set. The documentary is great. With interviews with his father the legend Larry the ax hennig, Curts wife and children. And superstars past and present that curt worked with or influenced. The only thing missing for me was a mention about his friend Rick Rude. Another one of my all time favorites. He needs a DVD too. Even without that its a great set with great matches highlighting the only perfect wrestler.",1311379200,,1013,4.22680412371134
3071220,5,B00120LPP6,"This is why i am still a wrestling fan, i DESPISE the new wwe, but Mr perfect is what i enjoy most about this amazing form of entertainment! the documentary is brilliant, but the match choices? well Bret Hart overkill for sure, but i can understand WHY they did it, the wcw bout was possibly too far, but it was kind of nice to see the progression of these two old foes, the inclusion of their CLASSIC summerslam 91 was to be expected, so i am happy about that, and the 1989 one? yes! it has a place here too, the king of the ring would surely have been a better choice than the uncensored, but they were perhaps going for as varied a selection as possible..i would have much rathered ALL wwf instead of awa and wcw, however i completely except why they were on there, after all he had to start somewhere,and fans wishing to see his beginnings would have appreciated these matches, and lets face it there is ENDLESS sources to allow someoneto see his wwf run!

The only matches that i had never seen was the tornado one and the Terry Taylor, these were a lovely addition!",1291852800,,1071,4.3283582089552235
3071221,5,B00120LPP6,"When I set out to buy The Life And Times of Mr. Perfect, I expected some classic wrestling matches from one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time. I got that and more. Since Mr. Perfect has passed on, his father, Larry ""The Axe"" Henning talks about his son's life. Other members of his family were interviewed as well as wrestlers from his past. Very entertaining and informative throughout.

The Matches:
While I won't review all the matches one by one, I will say that they were all great. One that surprised me was the one with Nick Bockwinkel;I had never seen it before and it was easily a four star match. His classic matches with Bret are also here and are just as great as ever.

Overall, any fan of technical wrestling in or wrestling in general should enjoy this DVD set. RIP Curt Henning you are missed!!",1284768000,,824,4.486666666666666
3071222,4,B00120LPP6,"I grew up watching Mr. Perfect in the ring.  His heyday was the late 80's and early 90's when wrestling in the Hulkamania era was in one of it's boom periods.  Perfect added a lot to the WWF scene.  He was a guy you loved to hate but couldn't deny his charisma and impeccable talent in the ring.

The documentary of his DVD is nice and has some touching tributes by his son and widow, as well as good friend, Wade Boggs, and his fellow wrestlers.  I do think it missed out on a huge portion of his career.  The era where he was aligned with the Genius and feuding with Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Warrior was glossed over.  His time with Bobby Heenan was similarly barely mentioned nor his time as executive consultant for Ric Flair.  I also missed his face turn and feuds with Lex Luger or Shawn Michaels.  This era was a huge part of Hennig's career.  Far more important than his time as a commentator or his prankster side which were both covered too heavily.

This dvd is worth it if you respect the contributions Curt Hennig has made to sports entertainment.  Just be advised that the documentary is lopsided and misses a lot of crucial Mr. Perfect moments.",1278288000,3,1158,4.384976525821596

3071224,3,B00120LPP6,"Good dvd.  Good matches.  Good documentary.  However, it allmost completely ignores Curt Hennig's drug problems.  A small tidbit for maybe 30 seconds near the end mentions he died from a cocain overdose.  I felt the dvd lacked the full honesty of Curt Hennig's life because it hid his drug use almost completely.",1261180800,2,312,4.923076923076923
3071225,4,B00120LPP6,I Felt Like They Could Have Did Better Wit The Matches Cuz Curt Henning Had Way Better Matches Than THey Put On This DvD really they could ve alot better than but the story bout Mr. Perfect is very Good though RIP To Mr Perfect.,1254009600,,228,4.088888888888889
3071226,4,B00120LPP6,"From seeing the DVD ste of the life and career of Curt Hennig, I have to say that while I thought the documentary and some of the extras(most notably the ""Rap Is Crap"" music video) was perfect, the match selection falls a little short.

Except for some of the matches, I highly reccommend this DVD on one of the greatest wrestlers who have ever lived.",1237075200,,351,4.4
3071227,5,B00120LPP6,"No hype here, this is the best wrestling DVD ever. Besides seeing some great matches (and Mr. Perfect was my all time favorite wrestling ""heel""), you really get a good sense of who Curt Hennig was. The discussion about how they made the Mr. Perfect vignettes, and the bloopers from them, show alot about the man behind the character. The one thing they really didn't touch on was what brought on the drug use. I think maybe that he was cut from the WWF after his second run really depressed Curt, but of course Vince McMahon wasn't going to delve into that. Regardless, this was a fantastic DVD, and it made me both happy to relive the career of one of the best performers ever, and sad to once again think about the tragedy of such a bright light extinguished much too soon. An absolute must for the serious wrestling fan (does that sound like a contradiction in terms?)and a great example to the younger generation who want to find out who Curt was.",1233878400,,951,4.471264367816092
3071228,3,B00120LPP6,"Great documentary, i just wish Mr. McMahon could have been involved. However, what idiot put together the match selection? He loses every one of them in the WWE, no sign of the great loser leaves wwe match with Ric Flair or his first wrestlemania and summerslam appearances where, god forbid, he actually won. Far from perfect...",1227052800,5,329,4.892857142857143
3071229,5,B00120LPP6,I thought this DVD was absolutely perfect. Along with the story of Curt you also get to see the matches. It is one DVD for the true wrestling fan. It is sad to see Macho Man postponed as well as Sting. I mean they did come out with the self destruction of the ultimate warrior. Give us fans what we want.,1226966400,,304,4.0
3071230,5,B00120LPP6,"My first experience watching Curt Hennig was on a WWF broadcast during the early 80's from Allenstown, Pennsylvania. Before I knew it, he was gone(to the AWA). When he resurfaced again five years later, suddenly he was Perfect.

Although I wasn't a big fan of Curt back in the day, watching this DVD now has really brought me a new level of respect towards the charisma and athleticism of Mr Perfect.

His documentary is graced by such individuals as Greg Gange, Larry ""The Axe"", Brad Rheigans, Wade Boggs, Tony Garea, Leonice Hennig, etc. giving their personal memory and complements towards Curt. Also some old photos of Verne Gagne, Curt as a young boy, Curt & Leonice aroung high school time, and Curt's kids. Footage of Curt's matches from MSG and Allenstown is also shown. Only annoying thing about the documentary is that there was some ""kayfabe"" from Curt's dad.

There was one point during the Wrestle-fest bout against Terry Taylor in which no one was paying attention to the in-ring action. People had their backs turned staring up into the nose-bleed sections(probably annoyed Perfect that a couple drunken brawlers got more attention than his bout). Additionally, I really enjoyed the commentary of Mick Foley & Michael Cole during the match. Foley always has interesting things to say regarding wrestling.

His World title bout against Nick Bockwinkel was an hour-long exhibition of classic mat-wrestling with many long leg and arm locks. Sure to bore fans who were bred on the ECW hardcore stuff. Obviously, Bockwinkel, an old-school wrestler, employed a match psychology from another era of wrestling.

My only gripe with this collection, same as with most WWE collections, is the selection length of matches. They could have easily made this a 3 DVD set with twice the amount of matches. Perfect had a long career and many great matches. Why not showcase it?

Overall though, I really enjoyed viewing this set. Soon as I popped in the DVD and heard that regal theme from Mr. Perfect, all the wrestling memories started flooding in for me. The Perfect vignettes were also really enjoyable to relive. Obviously, whether you are a Curt Hennig fan or a wrestling fan in general(especially of the older stuff), it behooves you to get your paws on a copy of The Life and Times of Mr. Perfect.",1223596800,,2303,4.892307692307693
3071231,4,B00120LPP6,"Curt Hennig is one of those people in wrestling who never had a major promotional machine behind himm (Hulk Hogan), wasn't always put in a position to be the top draw of the company (Ric Flair), or even the most popular wrestler (Sting) but was always over with the fans as either a face or heel, had some of the biggest respect & love from the wrestling industry today, and as without a doubt on of a kind weather he was in the ring wrestling or pulling a classic prank outside of it to the point where Michael Hayes at one time called him wrestling's version of ""Dennis The Menace."" The name given to him in the WWE just describes him at whatever he did in the wrestling business, PERFECT!

The documentry stars off talking about Hennig growing up, how he started wrestling young, and hung around his father (Larry ""The Ax"" Hennig) when he was training with Verne Gagne before meeting his future wife in high school. How Curt started wrestling for Vince Sr. before moving onto the AWA to team with his dad & Scott Hall (if you haven't seen him outside of his ""Razor Ramon/nWo"" look then you'll be suprized) was discussed before his feud with Nick Bockwinkel & becoming AWA Champion. How the feud between Curt & Greg Gagne spilled into a family feud with their fathers getting involved before losing the AWA Title to Jerry Lawler & leaving was brought up next. How he got the name Mr. Perfect & the truth behind the ""Absolutely Perfect"" sport skits was talked about with hysterical footage to go with the story before Wade Boggs tells a story of how Hennig saved his life. Curt's Intercontinental title reign was heavily talked about in terms of how he elevated the championship along with the SummerSlam match with Bret Hart. Stories of Curt's classic pranks were talked about next before talking about his back injury led to him being an announcer, how Curt did in his role in that position along with being advisers to Ric Flair & Triple H before moving on to WCW. The story behind Hennig's involvement with the Horsemen & the nWo was discussed along with Wade Boggs telling a story behind what he had to do with the ""nWo Wolfpac"" before moving on to the infamous ""Rap Is Crap"" song. The effect his Royal Rumble performance had on his career & his ""role"" within his last WWE run was profiled before closing out the documentry talking about his death, his Hall Of Fame induction, and legacy left behind with his son Joe training to be a 3rd generation wrestler.

Matches Include:
w/Scott Hall vs. Jimmy Garvin & Steve Regal - This was more of an match to showcase Hennig more than anything else as he was the legal man for the majority of his match showcasing his athletic & technical style.  You did see Hall display his power of the team as well but for the most part, this was all Hennig.
""AWA Championship Wrestling"" Nov. '85

vs. Bret Hart - This was more of a preview for their series of matches in later years as Bret was still part of the Hart Foundation tag team while Hennig was in the early stages of his ""Mr. Perfect"" gimmick.  Great technical match between both men but again, they would go on to bigger & better matches against each other.
""MSG"" Apr. '89

vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - Hulk Hogan said during the documentry something to the extent of how you had to bring your A game when you went against Hennig.  Well, Curt Hennig was a good counterpart for Hogan as Hennig just knew how to sell (or oversell, depending on how you look at it) Hogan's offense while also had Hogan be more competitive than your used to seeing against others.  The Genius was Perfect's manager at this time and added to this match as well which in the end was a better inring quality performance that ""sterotypical Hogan"" match you would usually get at these house shows.
""MSG"" Jan. '90

w/special refree Roddy Piper vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Kerry Von Erich - Before the match, pay attention to the ""patdown"" that he gives Hennig...classic comedic Piper.  Hennig & Von Erich had good matches against each other & this was no exception either as a miscue with an exposed turnbuckle really hurt Perfect's back throughout most of the contest.  It was a good match between the two eventhough I would have prefered the match where Hennig regained the championship days later.
As a side note, check out for the aftermath afterwards between Hennig & Piper that would lead to their match the next month that is available on the ""Legends Of Wrestling: Roddy Piper/Terry Funk"" DVD.
""MSG"" Nov. '90

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Bret Hart - This is a pure wrestling fans dream here and tons of credit here goes to Mr. Perfect for putting on this type of performance with a back injury that would keep him out of the ring for over a year. This would be the match that put Bret Hart on the map as a solo star & was also the debut of the Sharpshooter.
SummerSlam '91
(""Bret Hart: Best There Is, Best There Was, Best There Ever Will Be"" & ""History Of The Intercontinental Championship"")

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels - These two had been feuding with each other ever since their backstage brawl at WrestleMania IX & Hennig costing Shawn the Intercontinental Title against Marty Jannetty.  These two just flowed with each other with Shawn working over Perfect's lower back.  Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel (Kevin Nash), did come into play at times & was the deciding factor in the end of what was otherwise a good match.
SummerSlam '93

vs. Bret Hart - This was from their short feud in WCW where Bret Hart has issues with the nWo so Curt Hennig took on the task of taking out Bret Hart.  Hennig did focus on Bret's knee but it was interesting to hear how Mike Tenay referenced to their past history without actually mentioning WWE by name.  As was typical with the nWo at that time, Rick Rude did get involved & delivered the first Rude Awakeing in years.  This was a good encounter as they never had a bad match but they've had much better.
WCW Uncensored '98

Other matches include a match from his early '80s WWE run vs. Eddie Gilbert, his classic one hour match vs. AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkle, and vs. Terry Taylor with commentary by Mick Foley & Michael Cole.

DVD extras include all of the Mr. Perfect sports vignettes featuring such celebrities as Wade Boggs & Steve Jordan & Felton Spencer& Mike Modano, his Hall Of Fame induction, the ""Rap Is Crap"" music video, and bonus stories on how Curt loved karaoke & the funny truth behind his appearence on ""Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous"" told by Brock Lesnar. Hidden DVD extras include bonus stories of pranks Curt did by Wade Boggs & Chris Jericho, a live performance of ""Rap Is Crap"" on WCW Thunder, a promo Hennig did as AWA Champion, and the infamous segment where Curt Hennig destroyed the WWF Championship with a hammer...which would later become the famous WWF Hardcore Championship almost a decade later.

In the end, the only negatives I could state is that I think something could have been said for his close friendship with Rick Rude & while I didn't think the Terry Taylor match wasn't anything special, the commentary with Foley talking about Hennig made up for it. Eventhough his SummerSlam match with Bret was a classic, it was already on Bret's DVD (which they advertised during the documentry) & on the upcoming Intercontinental Championship DVD so it wasn't really necessary here & could have been easily replaced by the tournament final were he actually won the Intercontinenal Championship from Tito Santana or a Ric Flair match from their feud in WCW. Besides those minor issues, this DVD is fits the name for the late Curt Hennig who was one of the greatest inring wrestlers & personalities for his generation...PERFECT! I recommend.",1222992000,20,7735,4.62654996353027
3071232,5,B00120LPP6,"Curt Hennig, Mr. Perfect, was one of the greatest pro wrestlers ever. He had a natural talent that many would die for. He also had the charisma, charm, humor and good looks to go with it. He was perfect! This DVD set is wonderful. The documentary truely captures the essence of who Curt Hennig was, inside and outside the ring. For those of you who grew up watching him, you will no doubt cry towards the end of this moving biography. This set also features 10 matches ranging from good to great. They could have picked better matches in some cases, but it's hard to please everyone. The vignettes are just as entertaining today as they were when they first aired. Watching Mr. Perfect throw a football down the field and run and catch it is hysterical. While this set may not be everything everyone wants it to be, it is a great way to pay tribute to a man who was absolutely perfect. Unfortunately, his life was tragically cut short. Here is your chance to relieve some of the magic created by an entertainer who was gone too soon.",1222646400,,1033,4.442105263157894
3071233,4,B00120LPP6,"This DVD is worth it for the Rap is Crap music video alone. That said, I wish there was some more WCW stuff - he DID have some entertaining moments there besides that one video. But ah well, good set anyway.",1221436800,,207,4.073170731707317
3071234,3,B00120LPP6,"I was glad to see a Mr. Perfect DVD getting released, but I can't help but be a bit disappointed with some of it. The story portion of the DVD is good, as well as the vignettes, but the selections of matches were too few and too weak..I mean, do I really wanna see a match Henning versus Terry Taylor? I mean, no disrespect, but Terry Taylor was exactly Wrestling royalty! And where's the match with Jerry the King Lawler? Its referenced on the DVD as being an important match in Henning's career, but yet its not included. What about when he turned on the horsemen in WCW?? Out of the 10 matches included, 3 of them are against Bret Hart. Now, don't get me wrong, matches between Hart and Perfect are some of the best wrestling you're ever gonna see, but if you're gonna include 3 matches with the same opponent, at least put more matches on the collection! However, if you're a wrestling and/or Mr. Perfect fan, this collection is worth owning simply for the story and the matches against Bret Hart, and the classic match with Nick Bockwinkel. I just hope future wrestling collections include more matches!",1221350400,3,1108,4.545
3071235,4,B00120LPP6,"Some may wonder why WWE decided to release a DVD featuring Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig, but I welcome it. I wish WWE would release more DVDs like this. Not every feature star needs to be a main event legend to get his own DVD in my opinion.
This release features one of the best documentaries WWE has produced on any wrestler. It's very informative, entertaining and moves at a fast pace. The story of Curt Hennig is told by his family, friends and his fellow wrestlers. All of Curt's career highlights are featured and those who only know him as Mr. Perfect from his debut in the WWF in the late eighties, will get to see all of Curt's prior accomplishments in wrestling before becoming Mr. Perfect, and there are a lot of them! For example, Curt was the AWA World Heavyweight Champion before his stint in the WWF, and this is talked about in great detail.

Most are complaining about the match selection, and with good reason. There are some good ones in this set, but not many. I was shocked when WWE decided to include the classic one-hour draw AWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Hennig and champion Nick Bockwinkel from Nov. of 1986. This is pro-wrestling at it's best, with the last 10 minutes being just as good, or better, than any championship match you'll see today. Both men bleed and push each other to the limit. One thing to look for, is when Bockwinkel blades, there is a fan near the front row, who excitedly pantomimes Bockwinkel blading to his friends, letting them know how smart he is to the business. When Bockwinkel places the blade back into his wrist tape, this same fan also pantomimes this to his friends too. It's pretty funny to see.

The matches with Bret Hart are the best, but the inclusion of the match from WCW Uncensored between these two is perplexing, since it's so terrible, at this point Curt just wasn't the worker he once was and Bret was uninspired in WCW. The match from SummerSlam '91 is a classic, but has been released three times on DVD now, so chances are you've already seen it. The MSG match is interesting, because both men perform both their signature spots from their future SummerSlam '91 encounter as well as their classic King of the Ring match from '93. However, due to it's slow pace (most of those MSG shows were slowly paced) the match really isn't something you'll want to see over and over again. So, the highlight here is Curt's work in the AWA.

One match was included, simply to make a point and that's the match from WrestleFest between Hennig and Terry Taylor. Michael Cole and Mick Foley, who recorded new audio for this match, explained that these two were in the running for the Mr. Perfect gimmick, and Curt ended up receiving it. Couldn't they have just said this in the documentary and shown a few clips from this match instead of wasting a match selection on it? Poor decisions like this hurt the release.

One match I wish they had included, you only see highlights of it, is the AWA World Title match against Jerry ""the King"" Lawler. In the documentary, Lawler said this was his favorite match ever, so it would have been nice to see all of it.

So, I recommend this for the excellent documentary, vignettes and Curt's matches from the AWA, but don't expect much else that you'll either enjoy or have already seen on DVD before.",1221177600,11,3313,4.561344537815126
3071236,4,B00120LPP6,"This is dvd is worth getting for the heart felt documentary. It's even in informative for me since I didn't even know that cocaine was the cause of his death. I also like how his rap is crpa video is here and how his Hall of Fame Induction is included. There's a small list of matches though when their should be more. I mean a lot of fans of his like myself have waited years for this dvd and it will probably be the only dvd ever released for him. So, I wish they went all out match wise.

  When I heard he once teamed up with Scott Hall in the AWA I was curious. It's nice that one match with them teaming up is here even if it's a non-title match where Steve Regal and Jim Garvin are champs. While a good singles match is included against another late great in Eddie Gilbert but it's just a time limit drawer. His AWA World title win from Nick Bockwinkel isn't here as well. I don't know why the match where he actually won the title isn't included. You also have 3 classics against Bret Hart. He always worked great with Bret even if I don't think he ever beat him. Their King of the Ring Tournament match isn't here though, that was another good match between them.

  What I don't like about the match choices is that he lost a lot of the ones that the WWE chose to have. He was much much better than Hogan yet he always had to put over his lame moves and was even stuck in his shadow in WCW. So, I think his matches with Flair should have been included instead. They were good matches and he at least won most of their matches against each other. I think Flair might have beat him when he had his redneck gimmick in WCW. I also think that his U.S title win should have been included, not because Mongo was in his league but because it was Hennig's only single title reighn WCW. His only WCW match included is against Bret, when he didn't only have good matches with Bret there. I also liked his matches there against Jeff Jarrett, DDP, Flair and Dean Malenko.

  Benoit too of course but I'm not even going to bother asking why their matches weren't included. I haven't seen their matches in years though and do wish the WWE will release them on dvd or WWE 24/7 some day. I like the dvd for what it is but I do think the WWE should do what TNA has done and that's release 2nd and 3rd volumes for their dvds.  Hennig had a lot more than just 12 good matches. I just don't understand why the WWE works so hard to do a good documentary and include other good extras. Yet, have a shortage of matches for one of the best late great wrestlers.",1218758400,,2546,4.135627530364372

Curt Hennig, better known as Mr. Perfect, competed for the American Wrestling Association, World Wrestling Entertainment and World Championship Wrestling. Born the son of legendary Larry ""The Axe"" Hennig, it was perhaps inevitable that Curt would want to follow in his father's footsteps. But Mr. Perfect lived up to his moniker becoming one of the best in-ring technicians of his generation. A former AWA World Heavyweight Champion, he was also the longest-reigning Intercontinental Champion of the 1990s. Loved by fans and friends alike, Mr. Perfect entertained in and out of the ring, earning him the honour of induction into the WWE Hall of Fame. This two-disc set relives his life and career, from his early start as a second-generation star through AWA, WWE, and WCW. Some of his greatest matches and vignettes are included. Who was this man? Here's a hint... he was absolutely ""perfect"".

Curt Hennig is diffinately one of my top favorite wrestlers along with Randy Savage, Edge, Steve Blackman, Ric Flair, Hardcore Holly, and Scott Hall. This wrestler was truly amazing in the ring, mastering beautiful wrestling techniques. His theme, looks, and skills are as he described...and that is ""Absolutely Perfect"". I really hope this dvd gives an indepth story of the perfect career of Mr. Perfect, and also hope to see a good collection of matches, especially his run as an IC Champion.
Too bad we can't see him live in action anymore, i really hoped that one day i would meet him, as well as work with him in the ring.

Ray Trailer the Big Boss Man,Roddy Piper,Brett Hart were just a few that i got to know on a personal basis,but two Wrestlers who i became very good friends were Kerry Von Erich and Curt Hennig. One of my greatest experiences was during the Summerslam of 1990 when they met each other for the IC Champiomship and after the nights matches I gave both a ride to the Airport for their respective flights,this was during the time when Wrestlers did not travel in a bus but drove themselves or a hired a cab. Curt Hennig was always a class act and even years later when he was wrestlng for the XPW in florida,while I was down there he treated me like a close friend and introduced me to all the guys down there .I,am hoping that the WWF does a quality job on this dvd set for Curt and hope in the future they will do the same for Kerry Von Erich.

3305690,5,B00120LPP6,"Although a list of matches have yet to be show, I can tell this product will be a hit. Although WWE sometimes releases a dvd set and chooses the worst matches available. I have alot of old vhs tapes with Perfect matches on them and I hope they use some of them. Here is a list of things that will be on the set and some that should be on the set but probably won't be on. I hear its a two disc set, so I gather about 10 or more matchs. I hope.

Expect an hour to hour and half bio on the life and times of Perfect. Im sure they won't include the reason why he was fired back in 2002 after a brief comeback. He was drunk on a flight and picked a fight with the world champion and got canned the next day. A few other wrestlers were canned from that flight. It would make a good story but I feel WWE won't put that in there. The matches will include his Summerslam 91 match against Bret Hart (hope they pick a match no one saw), the loser leaves WWE Raw match against Ric Flair, a few AWA matches. Hopefully a WCW match as well.  I also have a feeling they will put the 2002 Rumble from when he entered-he did a great job. I have a strong feeling they'll have the 93 Summerslam match against HBK as well.

What I want to see: I want to see his 90 run as IC champion. He had some great battles agaisnt Tito Santana and Kerry Von Erich; His brief return when he wrestled the likes of RVD and Stone Cold; A good match against Hogan when they fought over the world title. The one on Hulk Still Rules wasn't the best match these two had.

He made a lot of wrestlers famous including Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Randy Savage, and The Ultimate Warrior.  But funny thing is that he never got the credit he deserved for doing what he did.  The matches I want to see on here would be the matches he had with Bret since all those matches are classics in my opinion, matches he had with Savage, with Flair in the WWE and WCW.  Also if they was going to get people to talk about him they could get Bret and Flair since both of those guys spent more time with Curt then anyone other then Bobby Hennan.  I also hope they would include some of his matches he had with Hogan and Piper when they was hot.

The antihero of sorts, Mr. Perfect. When he went in the ring, everything was just perfect, even when he sometimes lost. The music, the atmosphere, the perfect man. Yup. He was the perfect wrestler.

I was saddened, and my sister was heartbroken to hear about his death. There are several good tribute videos of him on youtube. He was a hero to us, when we were kids (I am now 28 years old, my sister 26.) You need to have heroes when you are young, as well as your parents.  And we had a few. Mr. Perfect was on that list, amongst cartoon characters from various cartoons we also watched along with WWF on that time, on sky channel (British network).

3305699,3,B00120LPP6,"There aren't anywhere near enough matches on here. I really hope this set isn't the last word on Mr. Perfect because I'd love to see WWE put together a set similar to what they did for Bret Hart and Ultimate Warrior. There are a ton of great matches that they didn't include here including his other great matches vs. The Texas Tornado (win or lose), his IC match vs. Ultimate Warrior,  his IC tournament finals match vs. Tito Santana (or the subsequent rematch from Saturday Nights Main Event),  his Loser leaves Raw match vs. Ric Flair, His Battle Royale win at Saturday Nights Main Event, just to name a handful. There are also a bunch of great matches vs. mid-carders like Hercules, Rugged Ronnie Garvin, Red Rooster, Jimmy Snuka, Tugboat, The Blue Blazer, Brutus Beefcake, etc, and all of this from his original run in the WWF that would be fantastic filler to push this to a 3-disc set.

Mr. Perfect helped to lay the foundation for the glamourization of the Intercontinental Championship and make it more than just a minor title. It became a counterpart to the World championship; an equal, and paved the way for great IC champs like Rowdy Roddy Piper, Bret Hart, British Bulldog, Jeff Jarrett, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, Owen Hart, Triple H, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, etc., etc.

Along with Bret Hart, Mr. Perfect was the greatest ""technician"" of the late 1980's to early 1990's and is one of the major reasons I'm such a huge fan of wrestling (at least old school wrestling) to this day and he definitely deserves the same treatment as Bret Hart and Ultimate Warrior and should get a deluxe 3-disc set with more matches on them.

well lets get down to the nitty gritty here of what you will see classic matches and vignettes from his AWA and WWF and WCW Years early MSG Matches .Some have said the set is lacking I beg to defer on that you will see the evolution of this man to what he became from his roots on up to being Mr. Perfect.

However I felt it could of came with more matches. 1 on 1,tag,ect... It just kinda lacks matches compared to other wrestling sets I've bought. Also, like nearly half the matches are against Bret ""Hit Man'' Heart. Which he's also a good wrestler, but it just feels like there are even less matches then. My 9yr old son & I enjoy watching the WWF era wrestling more than WWE wrestling. So I 've been trying to get many of the old school DVD's. Overall, if you like WWF era wrestling & wrestlers. Than I still recommend this DVD set. To buy it on Amazon for like $3.00 or less + shipping, it's worth it still. Worth adding to your collection. Just not perfect.",1331683200,,833,4.312101910828026

Being Canadian I never heard of him before he was Mr. Perfect, but it was obvious from the start this guy was born to be a great wrestler. All the vingnettes of Mr. Perfect are great too, if not cheesy as hell. The only problem I had was the interviews, outside of his family members, were more for the character of Mr. Perfect and less for the person he was, Kurt Hennig. It would have been nice to have them comment more on the real guy not the WWF/E character.

He didn't need to scream and holler or back attack an opponent. He didn't even need to cheat. He did it in the ring with perfection. I cheered him when he and the genius feuded with hulk hogan while my friends booed me. I cheered him when he beat babyface after babyface when he was IC champ while my friends booed me. I was ecstatic when he slammed ric flairs head with the cage door while everyone else was bummed. He had it all and so does this 2 disc set. The documentary is great. With interviews with his father the legend Larry the ax hennig, Curts wife and children. And superstars past and present that curt worked with or influenced. The only thing missing for me was a mention about his friend Rick Rude. Another one of my all time favorites. He needs a DVD too.

Since Mr. Perfect has passed on, his father, Larry ""The Axe"" Henning talks about his son's life. Other members of his family were interviewed as well as wrestlers from his past. Very entertaining and informative throughout.

The Matches:
While I won't review all the matches one by one, I will say that they were all great. One that surprised me was the one with Nick Bockwinkel;I had never seen it before and it was easily a four star match. His classic matches with Bret are also here and are just as great as ever.

3305719,4,B00120LPP6,"I grew up watching Mr. Perfect in the ring.  His heyday was the late 80's and early 90's when wrestling in the Hulkamania era was in one of it's boom periods.  Perfect added a lot to the WWF scene.  He was a guy you loved to hate but couldn't deny his charisma and impeccable talent in the ring.

The documentary of his DVD is nice and has some touching tributes by his son and widow, as well as good friend, Wade Boggs, and his fellow wrestlers.  I do think it missed out on a huge portion of his career.  The era where he was aligned with the Genius and feuding with Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Warrior was glossed over.  His time with Bobby Heenan was similarly barely mentioned nor his time as executive consultant for Ric Flair.  I also missed his face turn and feuds with Lex Luger or Shawn Michaels.  This era was a huge part of Hennig's career.  Far more important than his time as a commentator or his prankster side which were both covered too heavily.

This dvd is worth it if you respect the contributions Curt Hennig has made to sports entertainment.  Just be advised that the documentary is lopsided and misses a lot of crucial Mr. Perfect moments.",1278288000,3,1158,4.384976525821596

Besides seeing some great matches (and Mr. Perfect was my all time favorite wrestling ""heel""), you really get a good sense of who Curt Hennig was. The discussion about how they made the Mr. Perfect vignettes, and the bloopers from them, show alot about the man behind the character. The one thing they really didn't touch on was what brought on the drug use. I think maybe that he was cut from the WWF after his second run really depressed Curt, but of course Vince McMahon wasn't going to delve into that. Regardless, this was a fantastic DVD, and it made me both happy to relive the career of one of the best performers ever, and sad to once again think about the tragedy of such a bright light extinguished much too soon. An absolute must for the serious wrestling fan (does that sound like a contradiction in terms?)and a great example to the younger generation who want to find out who Curt was.",1233878400,,951,4.471264367816092

3305727,5,B00120LPP6,"My first experience watching Curt Hennig was on a WWF broadcast during the early 80's from Allenstown, Pennsylvania. Before I knew it, he was gone(to the AWA). When he resurfaced again five years later, suddenly he was Perfect.

Although I wasn't a big fan of Curt back in the day, watching this DVD now has really brought me a new level of respect towards the charisma and athleticism of Mr Perfect.

His documentary is graced by such individuals as Greg Gange, Larry ""The Axe"", Brad Rheigans, Wade Boggs, Tony Garea, Leonice Hennig, etc. giving their personal memory and complements towards Curt. Also some old photos of Verne Gagne, Curt as a young boy, Curt & Leonice aroung high school time, and Curt's kids. Footage of Curt's matches from MSG and Allenstown is also shown. Only annoying thing about the documentary is that there was some ""kayfabe"" from Curt's dad.

There was one point during the Wrestle-fest bout against Terry Taylor in which no one was paying attention to the in-ring action. People had their backs turned staring up into the nose-bleed sections(probably annoyed Perfect that a couple drunken brawlers got more attention than his bout). Additionally, I really enjoyed the commentary of Mick Foley & Michael Cole during the match. Foley always has interesting things to say regarding wrestling.

His World title bout against Nick Bockwinkel was an hour-long exhibition of classic mat-wrestling with many long leg and arm locks. Sure to bore fans who were bred on the ECW hardcore stuff. Obviously, Bockwinkel, an old-school wrestler, employed a match psychology from another era of wrestling.

My only gripe with this collection, same as with most WWE collections, is the selection length of matches. They could have easily made this a 3 DVD set with twice the amount of matches. Perfect had a long career and many great matches. Why not showcase it?

Overall though, I really enjoyed viewing this set. Soon as I popped in the DVD and heard that regal theme from Mr. Perfect, all the wrestling memories started flooding in for me. The Perfect vignettes were also really enjoyable to relive. Obviously, whether you are a Curt Hennig fan or a wrestling fan in general(especially of the older stuff), it behooves you to get your paws on a copy of The Life and Times of Mr. Perfect.",1223596800,,2303,4.892307692307693
3305728,4,B00120LPP6,"Curt Hennig is one of those people in wrestling who never had a major promotional machine behind himm (Hulk Hogan), wasn't always put in a position to be the top draw of the company (Ric Flair), or even the most popular wrestler (Sting) but was always over with the fans as either a face or heel, had some of the biggest respect & love from the wrestling industry today, and as without a doubt on of a kind weather he was in the ring wrestling or pulling a classic prank outside of it to the point where Michael Hayes at one time called him wrestling's version of ""Dennis The Menace."" The name given to him in the WWE just describes him at whatever he did in the wrestling business, PERFECT!

The documentry stars off talking about Hennig growing up, how he started wrestling young, and hung around his father (Larry ""The Ax"" Hennig) when he was training with Verne Gagne before meeting his future wife in high school. How Curt started wrestling for Vince Sr. before moving onto the AWA to team with his dad & Scott Hall (if you haven't seen him outside of his ""Razor Ramon/nWo"" look then you'll be suprized) was discussed before his feud with Nick Bockwinkel & becoming AWA Champion. How the feud between Curt & Greg Gagne spilled into a family feud with their fathers getting involved before losing the AWA Title to Jerry Lawler & leaving was brought up next. How he got the name Mr. Perfect & the truth behind the ""Absolutely Perfect"" sport skits was talked about with hysterical footage to go with the story before Wade Boggs tells a story of how Hennig saved his life. Curt's Intercontinental title reign was heavily talked about in terms of how he elevated the championship along with the SummerSlam match with Bret Hart. Stories of Curt's classic pranks were talked about next before talking about his back injury led to him being an announcer, how Curt did in his role in that position along with being advisers to Ric Flair & Triple H before moving on to WCW. The story behind Hennig's involvement with the Horsemen & the nWo was discussed along with Wade Boggs telling a story behind what he had to do with the ""nWo Wolfpac"" before moving on to the infamous ""Rap Is Crap"" song. The effect his Royal Rumble performance had on his career & his ""role"" within his last WWE run was profiled before closing out the documentry talking about his death, his Hall Of Fame induction, and legacy left behind with his son Joe training to be a 3rd generation wrestler.

Matches Include:
w/Scott Hall vs. Jimmy Garvin & Steve Regal - This was more of an match to showcase Hennig more than anything else as he was the legal man for the majority of his match showcasing his athletic & technical style.  You did see Hall display his power of the team as well but for the most part, this was all Hennig.
""AWA Championship Wrestling"" Nov. '85

vs. Bret Hart - This was more of a preview for their series of matches in later years as Bret was still part of the Hart Foundation tag team while Hennig was in the early stages of his ""Mr. Perfect"" gimmick.  Great technical match between both men but again, they would go on to bigger & better matches against each other.
""MSG"" Apr. '89

vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - Hulk Hogan said during the documentry something to the extent of how you had to bring your A game when you went against Hennig.  Well, Curt Hennig was a good counterpart for Hogan as Hennig just knew how to sell (or oversell, depending on how you look at it) Hogan's offense while also had Hogan be more competitive than your used to seeing against others.  The Genius was Perfect's manager at this time and added to this match as well which in the end was a better inring quality performance that ""sterotypical Hogan"" match you would usually get at these house shows.
""MSG"" Jan. '90

w/special refree Roddy Piper vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Kerry Von Erich - Before the match, pay attention to the ""patdown"" that he gives Hennig...classic comedic Piper.  Hennig & Von Erich had good matches against each other & this was no exception either as a miscue with an exposed turnbuckle really hurt Perfect's back throughout most of the contest.  It was a good match between the two eventhough I would have prefered the match where Hennig regained the championship days later.
As a side note, check out for the aftermath afterwards between Hennig & Piper that would lead to their match the next month that is available on the ""Legends Of Wrestling: Roddy Piper/Terry Funk"" DVD.
""MSG"" Nov. '90

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Bret Hart - This is a pure wrestling fans dream here and tons of credit here goes to Mr. Perfect for putting on this type of performance with a back injury that would keep him out of the ring for over a year. This would be the match that put Bret Hart on the map as a solo star & was also the debut of the Sharpshooter.
SummerSlam '91
(""Bret Hart: Best There Is, Best There Was, Best There Ever Will Be"" & ""History Of The Intercontinental Championship"")

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels - These two had been feuding with each other ever since their backstage brawl at WrestleMania IX & Hennig costing Shawn the Intercontinental Title against Marty Jannetty.  These two just flowed with each other with Shawn working over Perfect's lower back.  Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel (Kevin Nash), did come into play at times & was the deciding factor in the end of what was otherwise a good match.
SummerSlam '93

vs. Bret Hart - This was from their short feud in WCW where Bret Hart has issues with the nWo so Curt Hennig took on the task of taking out Bret Hart.  Hennig did focus on Bret's knee but it was interesting to hear how Mike Tenay referenced to their past history without actually mentioning WWE by name.  As was typical with the nWo at that time, Rick Rude did get involved & delivered the first Rude Awakeing in years.  This was a good encounter as they never had a bad match but they've had much better.
WCW Uncensored '98

Other matches include a match from his early '80s WWE run vs. Eddie Gilbert, his classic one hour match vs. AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkle, and vs. Terry Taylor with commentary by Mick Foley & Michael Cole.

DVD extras include all of the Mr. Perfect sports vignettes featuring such celebrities as Wade Boggs & Steve Jordan & Felton Spencer& Mike Modano, his Hall Of Fame induction, the ""Rap Is Crap"" music video, and bonus stories on how Curt loved karaoke & the funny truth behind his appearence on ""Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous"" told by Brock Lesnar. Hidden DVD extras include bonus stories of pranks Curt did by Wade Boggs & Chris Jericho, a live performance of ""Rap Is Crap"" on WCW Thunder, a promo Hennig did as AWA Champion, and the infamous segment where Curt Hennig destroyed the WWF Championship with a hammer...which would later become the famous WWF Hardcore Championship almost a decade later.

In the end, the only negatives I could state is that I think something could have been said for his close friendship with Rick Rude & while I didn't think the Terry Taylor match wasn't anything special, the commentary with Foley talking about Hennig made up for it. Eventhough his SummerSlam match with Bret was a classic, it was already on Bret's DVD (which they advertised during the documentry) & on the upcoming Intercontinental Championship DVD so it wasn't really necessary here & could have been easily replaced by the tournament final were he actually won the Intercontinenal Championship from Tito Santana or a Ric Flair match from their feud in WCW. Besides those minor issues, this DVD is fits the name for the late Curt Hennig who was one of the greatest inring wrestlers & personalities for his generation...PERFECT! I recommend.",1222992000,20,7735,4.62654996353027
3305729,5,B00120LPP6,"Curt Hennig, Mr. Perfect, was one of the greatest pro wrestlers ever. He had a natural talent that many would die for. He also had the charisma, charm, humor and good looks to go with it. He was perfect! This DVD set is wonderful. The documentary truely captures the essence of who Curt Hennig was, inside and outside the ring. For those of you who grew up watching him, you will no doubt cry towards the end of this moving biography. This set also features 10 matches ranging from good to great. They could have picked better matches in some cases, but it's hard to please everyone. The vignettes are just as entertaining today as they were when they first aired. Watching Mr. Perfect throw a football down the field and run and catch it is hysterical. While this set may not be everything everyone wants it to be, it is a great way to pay tribute to a man who was absolutely perfect. Unfortunately, his life was tragically cut short. Here is your chance to relieve some of the magic created by an entertainer who was gone too soon.",1222646400,,1033,4.442105263157894

3305731,3,B00120LPP6,"I was glad to see a Mr. Perfect DVD getting released, but I can't help but be a bit disappointed with some of it. The story portion of the DVD is good, as well as the vignettes, but the selections of matches were too few and too weak..I mean, do I really wanna see a match Henning versus Terry Taylor? I mean, no disrespect, but Terry Taylor was exactly Wrestling royalty! And where's the match with Jerry the King Lawler? Its referenced on the DVD as being an important match in Henning's career, but yet its not included. What about when he turned on the horsemen in WCW?? Out of the 10 matches included, 3 of them are against Bret Hart. Now, don't get me wrong, matches between Hart and Perfect are some of the best wrestling you're ever gonna see, but if you're gonna include 3 matches with the same opponent, at least put more matches on the collection! However, if you're a wrestling and/or Mr. Perfect fan, this collection is worth owning simply for the story and the matches against Bret Hart, and the classic match with Nick Bockwinkel. I just hope future wrestling collections include more matches!",1221350400,3,1108,4.545
3305732,4,B00120LPP6,"Some may wonder why WWE decided to release a DVD featuring Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig, but I welcome it. I wish WWE would release more DVDs like this. Not every feature star needs to be a main event legend to get his own DVD in my opinion.
This release features one of the best documentaries WWE has produced on any wrestler. It's very informative, entertaining and moves at a fast pace. The story of Curt Hennig is told by his family, friends and his fellow wrestlers. All of Curt's career highlights are featured and those who only know him as Mr. Perfect from his debut in the WWF in the late eighties, will get to see all of Curt's prior accomplishments in wrestling before becoming Mr. Perfect, and there are a lot of them! For example, Curt was the AWA World Heavyweight Champion before his stint in the WWF, and this is talked about in great detail.

Most are complaining about the match selection, and with good reason. There are some good ones in this set, but not many. I was shocked when WWE decided to include the classic one-hour draw AWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Hennig and champion Nick Bockwinkel from Nov. of 1986. This is pro-wrestling at it's best, with the last 10 minutes being just as good, or better, than any championship match you'll see today. Both men bleed and push each other to the limit. One thing to look for, is when Bockwinkel blades, there is a fan near the front row, who excitedly pantomimes Bockwinkel blading to his friends, letting them know how smart he is to the business. When Bockwinkel places the blade back into his wrist tape, this same fan also pantomimes this to his friends too. It's pretty funny to see.

The matches with Bret Hart are the best, but the inclusion of the match from WCW Uncensored between these two is perplexing, since it's so terrible, at this point Curt just wasn't the worker he once was and Bret was uninspired in WCW. The match from SummerSlam '91 is a classic, but has been released three times on DVD now, so chances are you've already seen it. The MSG match is interesting, because both men perform both their signature spots from their future SummerSlam '91 encounter as well as their classic King of the Ring match from '93. However, due to it's slow pace (most of those MSG shows were slowly paced) the match really isn't something you'll want to see over and over again. So, the highlight here is Curt's work in the AWA.

One match was included, simply to make a point and that's the match from WrestleFest between Hennig and Terry Taylor. Michael Cole and Mick Foley, who recorded new audio for this match, explained that these two were in the running for the Mr. Perfect gimmick, and Curt ended up receiving it. Couldn't they have just said this in the documentary and shown a few clips from this match instead of wasting a match selection on it? Poor decisions like this hurt the release.

One match I wish they had included, you only see highlights of it, is the AWA World Title match against Jerry ""the King"" Lawler. In the documentary, Lawler said this was his favorite match ever, so it would have been nice to see all of it.

So, I recommend this for the excellent documentary, vignettes and Curt's matches from the AWA, but don't expect much else that you'll either enjoy or have already seen on DVD before.",1221177600,11,3313,4.561344537815126
3305733,4,B00120LPP6,"This is dvd is worth getting for the heart felt documentary. It's even in informative for me since I didn't even know that cocaine was the cause of his death. I also like how his rap is crpa video is here and how his Hall of Fame Induction is included. There's a small list of matches though when their should be more. I mean a lot of fans of his like myself have waited years for this dvd and it will probably be the only dvd ever released for him. So, I wish they went all out match wise.

  When I heard he once teamed up with Scott Hall in the AWA I was curious. It's nice that one match with them teaming up is here even if it's a non-title match where Steve Regal and Jim Garvin are champs. While a good singles match is included against another late great in Eddie Gilbert but it's just a time limit drawer. His AWA World title win from Nick Bockwinkel isn't here as well. I don't know why the match where he actually won the title isn't included. You also have 3 classics against Bret Hart. He always worked great with Bret even if I don't think he ever beat him. Their King of the Ring Tournament match isn't here though, that was another good match between them.

  What I don't like about the match choices is that he lost a lot of the ones that the WWE chose to have. He was much much better than Hogan yet he always had to put over his lame moves and was even stuck in his shadow in WCW. So, I think his matches with Flair should have been included instead. They were good matches and he at least won most of their matches against each other. I think Flair might have beat him when he had his redneck gimmick in WCW. I also think that his U.S title win should have been included, not because Mongo was in his league but because it was Hennig's only single title reighn WCW. His only WCW match included is against Bret, when he didn't only have good matches with Bret there. I also liked his matches there against Jeff Jarrett, DDP, Flair and Dean Malenko.

  Benoit too of course but I'm not even going to bother asking why their matches weren't included. I haven't seen their matches in years though and do wish the WWE will release them on dvd or WWE 24/7 some day. I like the dvd for what it is but I do think the WWE should do what TNA has done and that's release 2nd and 3rd volumes for their dvds.  Hennig had a lot more than just 12 good matches. I just don't understand why the WWE works so hard to do a good documentary and include other good extras. Yet, have a shortage of matches for one of the best late great wrestlers.",1218758400,,2546,4.135627530364372

Curt Hennig, better known as Mr. Perfect, competed for the American Wrestling Association, World Wrestling Entertainment and World Championship Wrestling. Born the son of legendary Larry ""The Axe"" Hennig, it was perhaps inevitable that Curt would want to follow in his father's footsteps. But Mr. Perfect lived up to his moniker becoming one of the best in-ring technicians of his generation. A former AWA World Heavyweight Champion, he was also the longest-reigning Intercontinental Champion of the 1990s. Loved by fans and friends alike, Mr. Perfect entertained in and out of the ring, earning him the honour of induction into the WWE Hall of Fame. This two-disc set relives his life and career, from his early start as a second-generation star through AWA, WWE, and WCW. Some of his greatest matches and vignettes are included. Who was this man? Here's a hint... he was absolutely ""perfect"".

Curt Hennig is diffinately one of my top favorite wrestlers along with Randy Savage, Edge, Steve Blackman, Ric Flair, Hardcore Holly, and Scott Hall. This wrestler was truly amazing in the ring, mastering beautiful wrestling techniques. His theme, looks, and skills are as he described...and that is ""Absolutely Perfect"". I really hope this dvd gives an indepth story of the perfect career of Mr. Perfect, and also hope to see a good collection of matches, especially his run as an IC Champion.
Too bad we can't see him live in action anymore, i really hoped that one day i would meet him, as well as work with him in the ring.

Ray Trailer the Big Boss Man,Roddy Piper,Brett Hart were just a few that i got to know on a personal basis,but two Wrestlers who i became very good friends were Kerry Von Erich and Curt Hennig. One of my greatest experiences was during the Summerslam of 1990 when they met each other for the IC Champiomship and after the nights matches I gave both a ride to the Airport for their respective flights,this was during the time when Wrestlers did not travel in a bus but drove themselves or a hired a cab. Curt Hennig was always a class act and even years later when he was wrestlng for the XPW in florida,while I was down there he treated me like a close friend and introduced me to all the guys down there .I,am hoping that the WWF does a quality job on this dvd set for Curt and hope in the future they will do the same for Kerry Von Erich.

Yes, it's true. I just got this DVD recently and I watched the documentary. As a fan of WWF/WWE since 1986, I enjoy now watching the documentaries that the WWE produces on some of my favorite wrestlers.

This DVD while it has it's shortcomings, I really enjoyed the documentary. I love seeing the WWE trace the careers of these guys and the fact that they can include AWA/NWA and more in these stories is awesome.

I wish they would have spent more time discussing why Curt's title chase for the WWF title and his feud with Hogan stuttered out. They don't talk about that at all. I also wish they would have gotten into his post-wrestling career leading up to his death. Was he depressed, did his wife know of the drug use?

All in all a great DVD collection. It could have easily been spread to a 3rd disc, but what they have included is a really good look at a career that thrived in both WWF and WCW which is rare.",1511654400,,970,4.313186813186813
