3487089,5,B001B94K4Q,I highly recommend this set of DVD's and the clever way that they lead your child into learning some musical basics.  They are fun and brilliantly done.,1363478400,,152,4.62962962962963
3487090,4,B001B94K4Q,"The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the way the menu is set up for the dvds. They are confusing and you can not select a play all option that exactly works. Other than that this is a great deal compared to other Little Einsteins dvds that I have seen. My son is obsessed with the show and this is a nice way to have the show at all times with out having to remember to set it up to record, etc. The packaging and quality of the dvds are great.",1359504000,3,466,3.814432989690722

3487092,5,B001B94K4Q,I bought the Little Einsteins 3-Pack Vol. 1 for my grand kids and they love watching them and sing along with the shows.  It;s a nice way to expose them to classical music and art.,1353369600,,180,4.142857142857143
3487093,5,B001B94K4Q,"This 3 pack is so great! My daughter loves it and it's one of the cartoons that I can stand because she learns so much! She loves to pat, sing, and dance along with the characters and she's only 15 months old! Definitely a great purchase!",1297728000,,238,4.195652173913044
3487094,4,B001B94K4Q,This was a favorite Christmas gift for our toddler. He absolutely loves watching Little Einsteins so this has become a special treat for him to be able to pick out which one he would like to watch.,1294185600,,197,4.351351351351352
3487095,5,B001B94K4Q,"THis was a lifesaver for me. I had to travel out of state with my 2 year old daughter and purchased these DVD's hoping they would keep her entertained when needed and they did! She absolutely loved watching them over, and over, and over. Now that she is 3, she still sings the songs and occasionally wants to watch them.",1270166400,,320,4.35
3487096,5,B001B94K4Q,"I purchased for my pre-school grandson and it was a great choice.  This DVD set includes the segue from Baby Einstein to Little Einstein.  It has the episode of finding a home for Rocket.  If you have npt seen Little Einstein you will be pleased with the affect it has for pre-schoolers.  The classical music and graphics are fantastic, and great art is  part of the storytelling.  My 2 year old grandson could recognize and appreciate Impressionist Art! orks from his exposure to Little Einstein.",1238371200,8,497,4.788235294117647
3487097,5,B001B94K4Q,"My kids LOVE little einsteins. We have had access to episodes any time through our cable on-demand service.  We recently downgraded to basic cable to save $$$, so I decided to buy some DVDs for after-work/trying to cook dinner/etc. I am writing this review because the product description has a MAJOR ISSUE-It doesn't say which 3 DVD's are included in this 3-pack.  After reading the other customer review and comments, (why the reviewer didn't include this info in the first place, I just don't know.)I decided I had to buy this 3-pack before buying any other DVDs so that I could find out. Without going into detail of the individual episodes per DVD, the titles of the three DVD's are:
Mission Celebration!
Team Up For Adventure
Our (Big) Huge Adventure
It looks like amazon sells each of these DVD's individually as well.  I will probably buy the Fall 2008 3 pack next, since it includes a different set of DVDs. After we watch the DVD's I will check back in with more details about the individual episodes.",1237680000,190,1011,4.700564971751413
3487098,5,B001B94K4Q,"Little Einstein is much loved by my 2-year-old grandson and his favorite is the Huge Surprise.  It turns out this movie, which he already had, is also in this three-pack.  Unfortunately, the advertisement did not tell me which movies were included, or I might have ordered differently.",1229731200,5,285,5.042553191489362
