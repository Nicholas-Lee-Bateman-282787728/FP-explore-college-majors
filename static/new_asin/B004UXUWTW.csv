4471382,5,B004UXUWTW,"This movie is about a woman named Kate Reedy (Sarah Jessica Parker) who jungles a carrer as a finance executive and being a mother of two.  Kate devotes her day to her job and night to her husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear) and their children.  Even though Kate is busy at work by traveling, conference calls, meetings and deadlines she always found time to get involved in her daughter's school.  But when Kate is handed a major new account that will require a lot of trips to New York to work with her charming new business associate, Jack Alelhammer (Pierce Brosnan).  Meanwhile Richard also wins a new job and now things are little a little crazy on the home front.  In the end  Kate realizes that only thing that matters is family. She learns to take a break and enjoy her kids.  Watch this movie and find out the rest.  Love this movie I would totally recommend this movie to watch with your friends with a pizza night.  Hope you enjoy it!",1325721600,,942,4.461988304093567
4471383,3,B004UXUWTW,"The movie was cute, brought up some valid points.  But it was also whiny and unbelievable in some sections.  Overall a decent movie.  But Sarah Jessica Parker is just a little to old to be playing the part.  Her age is showing and her co-stars that played her friend and husband were just enough younger looking than her so she came off as simply too old.",1325721600,,355,4.333333333333333
4471384,2,B004UXUWTW,"There is not too much else to say about the story, which concerns a woman who is almost too busy to attend to her husband and kids at all.  That said, it does play into some stereotypes regarding working mothers.  Will she ever learn to balance things? Does it matter?  We have seen this before.",1325548800,,295,4.327272727272727
4471385,4,B004UXUWTW,"I liked this movie quite a bit. I'm a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and that's part of what attracted me to this movie. For me this movie was like Sex and the City without the sex. SJP, narrates most of the movie along with a few other people in her life. I wasn't sure about the film until I was an hour through the movie, and for me the things that happened in the plot were my reasons for liking it not the actors. I feel like anyone who likes Sex and the City or Bridget Jones' Diary (and the way is was self narrated by the character) would enjoy this movie.",1325548800,,561,3.9734513274336285
4471386,2,B004UXUWTW,"""I love my work, although sometimes I wish I didn't love it so much."" Kate Reddy (Parker) has two young kids, a loving husband and a job she loves. The only problem is the job offered her a promotion and that means more travel and strain on her family. I have to start this by saying that being a guy this is not my kind of movie at all. The best way to describe it is that this is a movie about Carrie Bradshaw with a family and a different job. Even the part where she has voice overs and talks to the camera a few times is in this. While this movie does show a woman in the role usually played by the man in movies (which is a good idea) this is still very boring and repetitive. There are a few funny parts in this, but again the movie is not made for me. Fans of chick-flicks and ""Sex and the City"" will probably love this. I did not. Overall, a movie that was too much of a chick-flick for me to get into. I give it a B-",1324944000,,926,3.8534031413612566

I'm buying this one because it will be a classic for me and may even get a place next to my copy of 'Fried Green Tomatoes""....we'll see. by the way this is 'Heather Mistretta' not 'Anthony' writing this. I loved this movie! The characters were brought out and paired up marvelously. There were real life scenarios brought out in tasteful, entertaining ways while at the same time sticking to realism. Loved it!!!",1316995200,4,478,4.635294117647059
4471428,3,B004UXUWTW,"Not great, but not a total waste of time. Sort of a ""feel good"" film about a family with two working parents. They certainly make the whole thing seem much more complicated than it is - having two working parents - at least in my experience, but I guess that's the whole premise. Sarah Jessica Parker acting much the same as she does in every movie or t.v. program - with her signature breathy dialogue, and long soulful glances.",1489536000,,429,4.443037974683544

While it has it's moments pointing out the discrepancy between the treatment of moms and dads in the work place it seems to focus more energy pitting women SAHM against working moms. The dishonest portrayal of stay at home mothers as spoiled, self indulgent, and caddy is one dimensional and boring to watch. The working mom gets no better treatment shown as the scattered mess who must lie to cover up her short comings. The classic Baby boom is a much better choice.",1395100800,,566,4.67
4471588,5,B004UXUWTW,"A really funny take on the modern woman's life.  Sarah Jessica Parker does comedy angst very well.  Even though I've never lived this sort of life, she makes it both believable and funny on several levels.",1394496000,,205,4.666666666666667

In the end, I found her too much of a martyr with her family.  I felt her husband needed to step up to the plate more and whine less about it.  But it surprised me in that I enjoyed it.  I can't stand Carrie Bradshaw and this character was very unlike her.  I do remember SJP in Square Pegs, so I know she's capable of range.",1388966400,,492,3.9292929292929295

4471634,5,B004UXUWTW,"Sarah Jessica Parker is brilliant in this lovely movie about a working mom who has to make tough choices. She is raising two children and holding down a high profile job. The pressures on her are immense although her career is going exactly where she wants it to go. While some scenes are stressful there are also some very funny parts. I liked the part where she buys a pie and has to roll it down to fit it in a regular pie dish. The reason is apparently because the store is out of baking supplies, not because she can't cook. However she travels a lot and doesn't really have the time to be as domestic as a stay-at-home mom. You have to applaud her for trying to make her kids feel nurtured. I laughed a lot while watching this movie and felt the characters made good choices that benefited their family. I think any working mom could appreciate this movie and it would give her hope that she can really have it all.

4471636,5,B004UXUWTW,"I just watched this movie last night and thought it was hysterical!  I am a 41 year-old, college graduate, gainfully government-employed as a commercial real estate appraiser and mother of 3.  I completely related to this movie.  Why do you expect Kate to do all of her ""jobs"" perfectly???  Guess what - SHE CAN'T!  Big surprise?  Any mother or father knows that.  She does the best she can.  We all do.  At some point you let go of perfection and know that working and raising a family will not allow for it.  Also IT IS JUST A 2 HOUR MOVIE!  Not real life.  What do you really want from a movie?  It is a light comedy.  One woman wrote a comment that she thought it was disgusting and never wants kids.  Then why the heck would you watch this movie???

The lice incident had me crying.  ""Only the dirty kids have lice.""  So hilarous!  Any of you that don't have kids probably thought it was disgusting.  I was amazed to see they have places you can go for treatments (I hope they really do) for whenever that happens to me.  Loved the ""Momster"" references cause I can not stand them either.  Momsters think their life is so perfect since they get to stay home with the kids.  I wish I could but I am glad I have my own life as well.  I always buy store-bought goodies without a second thought.  I am glad they have the time to do it.  Good for them.

Bottom line, this is just a light comedy, no Gone with the Wind here.  If you are looking for something deeper, go somewhere else.  I am buying this movie.",1359072000,,1508,4.229681978798586

4471663,2,B004UXUWTW,"""I Don't Know How She Does It"" follows the life of Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) working for a financial management in Boston. She is mother of two children, and wife to architect Richard (Greg Kinnear), currently unemployed. Always hard working, Kate juggles multiple tasks at home and at office. Balancing family and career can be difficult, especially when Jack (Pierce Brosnan), a New York business associate, offers you a great chance to further her career.

Based on a book written by Allison Pearson, the film's screenplay is by Aline Brosh McKenna, known for ""27 Dresses,"" ""Morning Glory"" and of course, ""The Devil Wears Prada."" So far ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" is the most disappointing work penned by her.

To me the film's problem is simple. It doesn't have its own voice. The story looks like a rehash of other better romantic comedies. The characters, likeable as they are, do not have any distinct personality. This is not to say ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" is a total waste of celluloid. It is pretty amusing watching the interactions between Kate and Momo (Olivia Munn), Kate's competent assistant (who, unlike Kate, doesn't like kids).

No, it is just that everything is weak and tepid in ""I Don't Know How She Does It."" The weakness is perhaps because of the performances from the leads, or the mocumentary style that director Douglas McGrath (""Nicholas Nickleby"" starring Charlie Hunnam, ""Infamous"") overuses.

Her job isn't just any job, but a high powered money making position.  I know women like this who somehow manage to balance it all running from place to place.  I wonder how they get any sleep at night.  They're certainly too busy to see this movie that seems to be about them.  I don't have a fault with the plot or the actors.  It was a watchable movie.  The problem is that it was made as if it were a two hour long draining sitcom.  Sarah Jessica Parker holds her own as the lead, but she seems to be playing a very famous character she's played before in the ""Sex and the City"" franchise.  Only difference is, this is Carrie with kids, a high powered job, but the same Carrie voice over that wraps around the scenes through the film.  The other issue is that I think this is a topic that's been covered a long time ago and better in films like ""Baby Boom"".  I assumed that this topic has been do dated that you can't really spin the idea of women having a career and children.  As far as I'm aware, most women now who are in it for their careers aren't interested in having children.  At least the ones around me anyway.  Wise choice.

In fact, it is not an 'amazing' movie - don't expect a masterpiece - but it is not bad by any way of measurement. Of-course, the flim 'deals' with the stereotype of working mothers, but before you write it off as predictable feminism the character Kate Reddy (played by Sarah you know who) comes across as a genuine, nice person. Even though Kate has an up-market jobs, a lot of the problems she faces are universal - lack of time to spend with kids, boss calling you in to work when you thought you had a special night with the partner, jealous colleagues and the like.

Unfortunately, her friend Allison is trotted out to give the hard-line men-hate-us mantra now and then, and the film tries to mock stay-at-home mothers; as if stereotyping stay-at-home mothers will 'break' the working-mother stereotype. But they recover that with good interplay between SJP and Pierce Brosnan, as Kate deals with a flirtatious but supportive superior.

You leave this movie feeling sorry for the situation Kate finds herself in, and the plight of the modern working people who are rushing through life, but some of the other characters are a bit one-dimensional and are meant to be demeaning, although it was only ever meant to be comical.",1334707200,,1318,4.696969696969697

As a working mother with high stress job and whining/fighting children dying for my attention, it was the most disappointing message ever.

This movie ending is much more palatable.  But movie version really lost all the funny British humor and quotable lines from the book which actually read like a tragic/comedy to me, so 4 stars only.

Parker is such a talented actress, she is so down-to-earth but slightly neurotic as Kate, a mother of two who has a very demanding job. I thought Greg Kinnear was underused but I would definitely see this movie again, it has a lot of funny, real-to-life moments. Enjoy!",1333152000,8,569,4.7
4471671,1,B004UXUWTW,I have seen many Sarah Jessica Parker movies.  I'm her fan.  I adore her in Sex and the City; but this is the worst movie I ever seen her.  It's boring.,1333065600,2,152,3.838709677419355
4471672,3,B004UXUWTW,"Sarah Jessica Parker is an actress that most folks either love or hate. Some think she's adorable and others think she has horse like features.  Some think she's a tremendous talent while others think she's a hack. For me I think she fits somewhere in the middle. She may not always pick the best movies to make but she does her best and excels at romantic comedy. This brings us to I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT.

Parker stars as Kate Reddy, a financial consultant trying to make her way to the top. But she's more than that. She's also the mother of two adorable children. And she's married to Richard (Greg Kinnear), a husband who adores her and supports her career all while having his own as an architect. Kate also does her best to make herself a part of her kid's lives via PTA, etc. And all the mom's just can't get how she can do it all and have it all. But things aren't as great as they seem.

Trying to juggle each and every aspect of her life Kate seems on the surface to be handling things perfectly. But behind the scenes things are about to implode. She's just been given the go ahead to promote a project to Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) in New York and has to spend more time on the road. She's beginning to get her schedules mixed up as well as just who she's sending email to and planned holiday time just doesn't seem to work out.

But Kate tries her best. Along for the ride are her close friend who's amazed at her capabilities (Christina Hendricks), an assistant who's cool demeanor hides a dazzling brain and loyalty (Olivia Munn) and a boss who appreciates her skill more than anything else (Kelsey Grammer). Each affects her life but not nearly as much as Jack and her family. While Kate and Jack work together, they seem to becoming closer than she might like. And the business side of her life is taking over the private side and hurting things at home. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a tear jerker with tawdry items happening but a light hearted comedy.

Parker does a great job here as Kate, the bedraggled mother who wants it all and is doing her best to have it. She shows the competent Kate in the office but balances her out with the frazzled Kate trying to make sure her contribution to the bake sale is perfect for her daughter. She does it all with ease.

The supporting cast does a great job as well. Kinnear plays the happy husband who thinks his wife has it all under control but begins to worry when her job takes over her life. Brosnan is the always cool businessman who finds Kate charming. Both men in her life take up most of her time but in the end we know where Kate is going.

Many will probably say that this film offers far too much fluff and not enough heavy handed drama. So what? There are times when fluff is a good thing. Sit back and enjoy it now and then and stop thinking movies have to be filled with bad things to be good.

I've never been a big Sarah Jessica Parker fan but have always found she's been a good actress in most roles. She shines here. Fans will adore her no matter what. And for those who aren't this movie may just offer enough to make you become one.",1332201600,3,3131,4.285956006768189
4471673,3,B004UXUWTW,"This movie does manage to capture some classic working mom moments and get us to laugh at them, but unfortunately there's far too much outdated, offensive, stereotype-based humor for it to overcome. Sarah Jessica Parker's character works at an investment bank and is in the midst of launching a new career-making investment product, along with company executive Pierce Brosnan. She's married to Greg Kinnear's character, and they have 2 young kids together. She's torn and guilt-ridden, as she has to travel a lot for this gig, and frantically tries to make it all work. Some of the moments ring true - falling asleep instead of having sex with her husband, waking up in the middle of the night making lists of things to do, writing 'bouncy' on her hand to remind herself to order the bouncy house for her daughter's birthday, fearing her daughter's kindergarten teacher's reaction to being late more than major presentations at work.

But unfortunately, there are also lots of misses. The men in her work environment are outdated and offensive and not the least bit funny. The stay-at-home moms are ridiculous and even more offensive, and the 'war' portrayed between these two factions (aka the 'mommy wars') - is unnecessary and not funny. There could have been an opportunity here for showing female solidarity a bit, instead of cattiness, but the writers/directors chose not to go that route, and it's too bad. Compounding the problem is that Parker doesn't seem to have much chemistry with either Kinnear or Brosnan. Also, the documentary style 'interviews' with her friends and co-workers didn't seem t make much sense in the context.

So overall, this film had potential, but missed. And BTW, for anyone who has read the book (as I have) this is a very loose adaptation of that, doesn't follow the original storyline at all - more like a 'based on' version than a retelling of the book, so keep that in mind.",1332028800,2,1915,4.889230769230769

It is amazing to see how Kate juggles a huge job offer and her family.  She travels constantly and you see how both sides manage.  Throughout the movie there is also clips with interviews from other people in Kate's life, for example a ""Momster"" who acts like she is a superior mom because she stays at home (although she really probably spends less time with her kids!)  Kate shows that when she is home she makes the most of things with her family and really loves her family.

I laughed and I could relate, although I think a mom who works outside the home would laugh even more!  I also love Sarah Jessica Parker and it made me wonder how she as an actress and mom, does it all?

However, I DO agree with the majority of reviewers on here who said that in their opinion, this movie's ""stereo-type"" was on-point: the blonde chick who was the ""stay-home-all-day-who-drop-her-kids-off-at-school-and-then-stay-committed-to-the-gym-more-than-she-shows-committment-to-her-OWN-kids-mom""-is a joke. I mean, who the hell are YOU to critique SJP's character, when in essence, you're doing the same thing? You drop your kids off at school, and when you had anything to say, it was always said while you were hopping up and down on the friggin' stair-master! I mean, I didn't see YOU really spending any quality time with your ""little ones"", either! I know it's just a movie, but sadly, there really ARE air-headed women out here in the real world who does that! SOME things the red-head said(SJP's friend in the movie) were true: there ARE certain things that men can do and be praised for, while the woman is shot down continuously for doing the same thing....I think the only difference with that is, she just DOES IT BETTER!!!

Banking on the star power of Sarah Jessica Parker, coming off the second Sex and the City movie, I Don't Know How She Does It purports itself to be a comedy about a working mother named Kate Reddy who has it all, but must learn how to balance her career, her marriage, and her children. Unfortunately, I didn't really seem to care much about how Kate did it, as the film teetered hesitantly between comedy and drama and relied on hopelessly outdated viewpoints on gender to deliver its message. Despite a supporting cast that included the likes of Greg Kinnear, Pierce Brosnan, and Christina Hendricks, I Don't Know How She Does It is probably best suited as entertainment for those who are looking for just a small taste, just one more fix, of Sarah Jessica Parker in full-on, Sex and the City Carrie mode.",1328054400,7,951,4.567251461988304

4471724,2,B004UXUWTW,"The movie irritated me with the over abundance of first person narration and asides. It appears this was written as a play and no knew how to adapt it to the screen. Character is not built for you, but is read to you. It is easy to figure out ""how she does it:""

1) Super mom has better organizing skills than most people.
2) SJP has no trouble lying.
3) She takes short cuts.
4) SJP totes half of the world's possessions in her bag.
5) She has both an educated nanny and husband who support her.

That is how she does it.

Everyone in the movie will look into the camera and say ""I don't know how she does it."" SJP's character's name is ""Kate REDDY."" Get it? Her arch rival among the other mommies is Wendy BEST. These authors could write porno with imaginative names like that. We could name the husband ""Richard Reddy"" wink wink nudge nudge. Oh, they did!

Sarah is struggling to keep up with everything when her job requires her to travel from a Hollywood version of Boston (one where no one has an accent) to NYC even though they have wide screen teleconferencing. Her idea is to develop a retirement account for seniors built upon foreign high dividend paying stocks.

I wasn't able to laugh at this comedy. I found out that if a woman signs her e-mail ""XO"" that means ""I want you to enter me"" or for a guy, just the reverse. There are also the typical family disappoints due to work.

This is a ""chick flick"" for a married woman...the one that doesn't cheat on her husband with James Bond when she has the opportunity. Perhaps high octane working moms might enjoy this film as they are shown as incredible super heroes who strive for the heart warming ending. The asides of Christina Hendricks toward the end of the film deal with the stereotypes of women in the workplace in an attempt to give the movie meaning. I was only mildly entertained.

4471814,3,B004UXUWTW,"I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT is both the title of this shallow film and a question that needs to be posed to Sarah Jessica Parker: why is she continuing to take on films that are way below her talent? Based on a novel by Allison Pearson adapted for the screen (and transferred from England to the US) by Aline Brosh McKenna and directed by Doug McGrath this tale of a woman who everybody thinks is superwoman but in reality is an insecure career focused tinker in too many lines of living (mom of two young kids whose work results in her depending on a nanny to raise her children, wife of an aspiring husband who must take second place to his wife's career, miscommunicating new hire for an important role in finance, etc).

Part of the film's problem is the technique of having the various characters talk to the audience, often without even eye contact, trying to make the whole story hang together.  Sarah Jessica Parker (looking worn out and saggy) is the star of the film as Kate Reddy, Greg Kinnear is her it's-OK-to-be second-rate husband, Christina Hendricks has a bit of sparkle as Kate's omnipresent girlfriend, Olivia Munn is her Harvard trained office gopher, Pierce Brosnan is her important new boss who sort of sees her for what she is, Kelsey Grammer is her usual boss who is accompanied by the office smart mouth Seth Myers.  A lot of fine talent here pretty much wasted on a story so full of clich&eacute;s and standup comedienne routines and physical pratfalls that is sinks under its own weight.  How these films make it is a question that makes us take a look at what pleases current audiences. Pass.  Grady Harp, January 12",1326240000,2,1645,4.581632653061225

4471816,4,B004UXUWTW,"A solid, enjoyable movie mainly due to Sara Jessica Parker's persona. She's one of the few stars you want to keep watch and who keeps you in the movie no matter what it it. Beyond the superficial elements, like what she's wearing, she is so charming and appealing that audiences want to keep watching her. The movie had a few no-nos near beginning  like ""break the audience plane"" (actors directly addressing the camera) and talking about financial problems (box office kryptonite these days...see Confessions of a Shopaholic), but then really had a nice flow. I really admired they way Kate handled Jack, played by Pierce Brosnan - one of the best relationship scenes I've seen. Very honorable and opposite of endless scenes where character instantly succumb to impulse and temptation. The way the film make an impact was subtle. For example, a misplaced Power Point picture had a much stronger reaction because filmmakers did not show the typical reactionary shot of the supplementary characters, which matches perfectly with the narration style directed at the audience. I don't know the box office on this film and I don't need to know. It's great. Adding it to our movie library. I loved the sections on lists. My attitude has always been ""write it down so it's out of your head"", but something to be said for the process. Keeping all the items in your head. Thinking through each item. Prioritizing...Engaging stuff amid a world filled with stuff.",1325808000,,1453,4.930612244897959

8442383,5,B004UXUWTW,"This movie can be understood and appreciated only by women in a similar situation.

It is not about working parents, or about male-female equality, but about men/women who are at that take off point in their demanding careers (or businesses they own). It is kind of a transition point in life when everything is in chaos, until you get it together again.

I have been through several different aspects of the movie in my personal life, and therefore love how it is captured here. But yes, if your husband's architectural practice or your fund was about to take off simultaneously, when you have two young children under the age of 10, then you are in danger of falling apart.

The move is full of true life incidents, attitudes, and complications.

The husband that does not 'do the list'- exists
The woman who want so be a supermom- exists
The school mom who judges- exists
The young clueless baby sitter- exists
The junior female analyst who wants a career but no family- exists

I highly recommend it to parents in their 30s/40s.",1526169600,,1032,4.679558011049724

The main character was continually stressed-out trying to maintain the job and kids at home, even though her hubby made money too, and she had help at her house. So why??? could she never relax in the story? I felt stressed myself after watching the movie because it wasn't FUN or RELAXING. Too bad with such a stellar cast.",1522713600,,418,4.371794871794871
