8510200,4,B0013DR1IC,This was purchased as a gift.  I found the jewel case to be cheap and of low quality.  I also found that the title and information that was slipped into the covver of the jewel case to be like something a young child would put together and print at home....The quality was not there.  The DVD itself was fine.,1357948800,,309,4.203389830508475
