7166953,5,B00X9W29SW,"I wanted to second what other reviewers have said.  The DVDs are remarkable.  If you want to take a stunning journey to a part of our world rarely seen, this is an exceptional retreat.",1440028800,2,184,4.382352941176471
7166954,5,B00X9W29SW,"I love the way these DVDs show such a wide variety of unusual and sometimes very colourful fish in their natural settings.

There are two discs in this DVD set.  The first disc is an hour of continuous views of life in the blue ocean, which I find very calming and soothing.  I almost feel as if I am swimming with the turtle and the wide assortment of marine life large and small  all accompanied by very restful music.  I find it fascinating to watch the great shoals of small glittering silver fish as well as the close-up views of a shark.

The second disc features another great range of ocean life, including: a wonderful variation of different species of seahorses, highly-coloured clown fish, penguins and unusual jelly fish set among colourful coral reefs and rocky outcrops.  The backdrops vary through a surprising range of light to deep blue water.",1435104000,2,860,4.693333333333333
7166955,5,B00X9W29SW,"This is an absolutely beautiful set of HD DVDs of the ocean and its many inhabitants.  The first DVD is an hour long film of the ocean with everything from starfish to sea turtles.  My favorite scene is the sea horses as they gracefully glide through the ocean plants and sea.  This DVD will loop for extended uninterrupted viewing.
The second DVD offers six diverse scenes of the ocean, which can be looped individually or all together. The scenes on both DVDs are clear, professionally recorded as evidenced by the high quality, offer great sound options of waves or music.  The second one even offers the sounds of the ocean combined with music as an option.
Great set for just relaxing or for use during meditation. I am sure you will enjoy this set and also find some creatures that you didn't even know existed.  Some of the creatures even seem to glow.",1434585600,2,859,4.588235294117647
7166956,5,B00X9W29SW,"These two DVDs show wonderful creatures of the ocean, there is a wide variety of animal species. What I particularly liked is that even penguins are shown. This video is my favorite. The turquoise water and the beautiful funny animals, it`s just wonderful to watch them as they splash around in the water. But the other videos and the movie of disc 1 are marvelous to behold. There are many colorful corals, sea turtles, as well as entire schools of fish can be seen. The water always looks different, sometimes darker and mysterious, then turquoise or deep blue. I really like the variety of these DVDs. You can choose between relaxing music and ocean sounds. A DVD set for relaxing, in which I've met sea creatures, which I've never seen before. I can only recommend this set.",1432944000,4,778,4.686131386861314
7166957,5,B00X9W29SW,"This is an absolutely amazing set of ocean videos! I have many fish and ocean videos, but this one far outshines them all!! I always love watching the grace and beauty of sea creatures and these 2 DVDs have an abundance of this. While I love aquarium DVDs too, the wide open feeling of the ocean is the best by far! Disc One has a multitude of ocean creatures, many of them I've never seen or even know what their names are. A lot of this disc is filmed in the lower, darker waters where really beautiful and unusual creatures live. I don't think my eyes left the screen once during the disc - I didn't want to miss anything! Watching the sea turtle effortlessly gliding through the turquoise water is such a peaceful feeling - especially when you've had a stressful day! Then there's the jellyfish, starfish, clown fish, lion fish, huge schools of small fish that glide in sync, and all the other creatures you get the pleasure of watching. Mesmerizing. The music is really special, NOT loud and annoying - it just draws you in and hangs on to you. The second disc is also beautiful, colorful, and all the other adjectives that compliment both these videos. Awesome all the way around! As an added bonus, I also liked that at the end of the second disc there's even a film of penguins swimming and playing in the turquoise water. This set is gorgeous. I just don't have enough words to praise the quality of the photography and subject matter of these videos.

UPDATE: Since I think these are such amazing videos, I have now bought a set to send to an elderly friend - I'm sure she will get a lot of pleasure out of watching these two discs. She's not able to get out much these days.",1432771200,8,1685,4.4006410256410255
7166958,5,B00X9W29SW,"I have seen some strange and wonderful marine creatures in other movies, but in this DVD set I saw some creatures that I have never even knew existed.  Beautiful!  Colourful and amazing!  Not only will you enjoy a variety of fish, coral, sting rays, turtle, etc, but there is one creature that looks like a transparent light bulb and another one that is like a see-through ribbon dancing in the water.  Absolutely beautiful to watch!  Some even seem to generate their own electricity as they seem to glow in the dark.  The music is soothing and with a hint of the mysterious, which matches the underwater filming very well.  Not only are these 2 DVDs beautiful to watch, but they are very interesting too.  Highly recommended!! - You can watch a trailer of this set on the producers' website www.worldnaturevideo.com, where you can also purchase the digital download versions of these DVDs or also rent each individual segment.  I use Apple TV to stream the digital versions and it looks great on my HD TV.",1432771200,3,1006,4.702857142857143

By the time my husband came home all was better and I even felt better. There is a scene with a whale and I really wish there was more of that one, but they are all nice. The music is calming and the color is nice.",1452038400,,386,3.7195121951219514
