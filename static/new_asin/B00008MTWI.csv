1852344,1,B00008MTWI,"So where is it?
When I saw it advertised here last March (for a 3 June, 2003 release date),I immediately included it in my Wish List. Then after about a month it was 'currently unavailable'
I have waited for a very long time to watch this again and yet something happened...
When is it really coming out???
During the loooong wait, I've read 300 (the comic book by Frank Miller) and Spartan (by Valerio Massimo Manfredi).",1072137600,,421,4.552631578947368

But it seemed like it was already out because the back of the flyer said new to dvd.  Looking forward to it.  As a kid, it introduced me to the history of ancient Greece.",1055548800,5,444,4.265060240963855

1852348,4,B00008MTWI,"The narrow pass of Thermopalyae is long gone, with centuries of sendiment building a large plain.  The location of the statue of King Leonidas of Sparta set up along the highway does provide a sense of how narrow the geography was in 480 B.C. when a small force of Spartans and other Greek warriors held up the advance of King Xerxes and his Persian army (the parallels to the Alamo are palatable).  When I visited Greece last week I was glad we were able to stop at the monument for a few minutes, not so much because of what I had read in the history books about the Battle of Thermopalyae but because of the 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans.""
Granted the acting in this film from director Rudolph Mat is wooden, on a par with the Trojan Horse and the ships that turned out to the wooden walls of Athens that defeated Xerxes at Salamis.  But there is still something substantial to the battle sequences, as when Xerxes sends his Immortals against the Spartans and when the Spartans make a final valiant charge to kill the Persian monarch.  The basic political history of the times is covered in the film; Greece was debating whether or not to send soldiers that far north to stop the invaders and the Spartans decided not to send troops until a religious festival was over.  Consequently, King Leonidas (Richard Eagan) left with his personal bodyguard of 300 soldiers.  There is a trivial romantic subplot involving a young Spartan soldier and the girl he tried to leave behind, as well as an exiled Spartan King, Demaratus (Ivan Triesault) who tries to educate Xerxes (David Farrar) about the worth of these 300 soldiers.  In the end, the Spartans are betrayed by a Greek traitor who tells the Persians of a pass through the mountains where they can attack from the rear.  Leonidas learns of the treachery in time to evacuate the rest of the Greek army, but the Spartans will never retreat.
This was one of the last films directed by Mat, a respected cinematographer (""Pride of the Yankees,"" ""Lady From Shanghai"") who directed movies as different as ""D.O.A."" and ""When Worlds Collide.""  The battle sequences are the best part of ""The 300 Spartans,"" making excellent cinematic use of the contrast between the Spartans in their gold armor and red cloaks versus the black draped Persians with their wicker armor.  Eagan does not do much with the role of Leonidas, but he certainly gives the character the requisite sense of honor and nobility.  But perhaps the most memorable part of this film, which is one of the most cherished from my youth, is the marching music of the Spartans written by Manos Hadjidakis.  Clearly I am not alone in that regard.  ""The 300 Spartans"" is not a great film, but it has its moments and the tale is worth the telling.  Recently Frank Miller (""Batman: The Dark Night"") did his own graphic novel version of this story, which may well inspire Hollywood to remake this film.  It is certainly a tale worth telling again.",1050019200,205,2943,4.654440154440154
1852349,3,B00008MTWI,"I can remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. Actually there were about 7,500 Greek warriors at the pass.  Once the Greeks had found out that the Persians had found a way around the pass and were about to surround the Greek forces, Leonidas the Spartan king ordered all but his personal bodyguards (300), to retreat to fight another day.  The Persians who numbered 2,000,000 according to historians (200,000 is probably closer to the truth) were held for at bay for 5 days.
When they finally surrounded the Spartans and saw that there were only 300, they asked for the Greek weapons.  ""Molon Levee"" (""Come and get them"") was the answer.  The Persian army consisted of Persians, Egyptians, Jews, Assyrians, Nubians, Indians and even some defeated Greek states to name a few.  The Persian commander retorted ""We have so many archerers that if each one shoots an arrow at the same time, they will block the sun"".  Leonidas answered ""Good, then we shall fight in the shade."" This is in the movie if I remember correctly.
The Spartans lost the battle but bought enough time for the Greek forces to rally and defeat the Persian army and navy within one year.  With Athens and her population safe, democracy flurished
Wait for the next movie about this battle with George Clooney and Bruce Willis(?) ""Gates of Fire"" .  Production should begin in the next year or so.",1046822400,,1364,4.701680672268908
1852350,4,B00008MTWI,"I haven't seen this film in about 15 years. It is the epic story of the ancient Greeks attempt to hold the mountain pass at Thermopylae vs, at least, one hundred thousand Persians. There were more than 300 spartans there, I believe about 3000 total soldiers from various Greek states made up the force lead by the Spartans. This is sort of the Greek version of ""The Alamo"". Of coarse, the DVD has yet to be released. But here's what I remember;
-Not what most would consider a great film, but it tells the story of the battle without being insulting.
-If you like great acting, forget it. The acting is adequate.
-You think the Persians (Iranians plus troops from various conquered nations) are being slighted concerning their fighting skills(typical hollywood bias) but the Greeks had many advantages over their arch rivals. It's pretty realistic.
-About 3 quarters of the film concerns the actual battle and manuevers made. You'd better like sword-play action.
-The film, overall, is done well. It is in epic scale.
-This is one of 2 films I can recall concerning ancient Greek history.
-The other is ""Alexander the Great"" which also has not been released for about 15 years (VHS).

If they release this in PS version I will be seriously angry. I have never viewed this movie in it's natural format. This film hasn't been out in VHS, let alone DVD. 15 years of wait, I hope they get it right. (I gave it 3 stars pending the quality of the release. All things concidered, I'd give it at least 4 stars)

Follow-up: (10-6-2005)

I've now had the opportunity to actually buy and see the DVD.  I gave it 2 starts based on pre-release rumors that this was going to be released in pan-and-scan only.  Fortunately, it is in it's original widescreen dimensions.  It also has several trailers including original TV spots which are pretty unique.  My recollections of the film were pretty acurate.  It is not a great, artistic achievement, but it is a good, understandable re-telling of the battle.  Thankfully, release was delayed to get out the widescreen version, and thus, my rating gets bumped back up to 3.5 stars.  Still one of my favorite historical epic war movies.",1046044800,12,2165,4.73404255319149

1852427,1,B00008MTWI,"Folks:

Be very careful buying from Caroline's Company.  My dvd came and I could not play my used 300 Spartans at all.

BE VERY CAREFUL",1410134400,,135,4.32
1852428,5,B00008MTWI,Bought it for my ex. Never watched it,1408320000,,37,3.75
1852429,3,B00008MTWI,"There are currently four options for this film: the 2014 Blu-rays for Regions A and B; a 2004 Region 1 NTSC DVD; and a 2007 Region 2 PAL DVD.  The Blu-rays and the Region 1 DVD have a run time of 114 minutes.  The Region 2 DVD has a run time of 109 minutes (because PAL runs 4% faster than NTSC).  All four are described as having an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 resembling the film's original CinemaScope format.
I purchased the Region 2 DVD from Amazon UK and I've compared its screen image on a 16x9 HDTV with the Blu-ray screen images reproduced at blu-raydotcom.  There are differences: (1) the Blu-ray images are wider (i.e. showing more of the original CinemaScope image) and, consequently, with deeper letterbox mattes than the DVD; and (2) the Blu-ray images appear to have greater color saturation and a fair dose of digital noise reduction (since skin tones are blander than in the DVD).

The Blu-ray, according to Amazon, is available for Region A with English and Spanish audio and for Region B with just English.  These Blu-rays may not be interchangeable since Twentieth Century Fox is well known for releasing most of its titles with ""regional coding enhancement"" (i.e. restriction).

The Region 2 DVD has English, German, Italian and Spanish audio, and subtitles in 12 languages.

I found it difficult to reconcile the comments made about the Blu-ray's video quality by blu-raydotcom with my viewing of the 2007 Region 2 DVD.  It did not appear to me that ""colors have faded in expected ways, with flesh tones looking rather brown, blues and (especially) purples decidedly anemic and reds tipping toward the orange side of things.""

The music by Manos Hadjidakis is described by blu-raydotcom as being an ""anachronistic score that sounds too weirdly contemporary, almost like a modern day bouzouki band at times"".  Well, certainly like no bouzouki band on any of the CDs which I own.  (I wonder just what a non-anachronistic fifth-century BC score would sound like!)  The music is typical of the gung-ho film scores of many a sword and sandal epic.

I was able to avoid the ""hugh variety of accents running rampant throughout the film"" by playing the Region 2 DVD dubbed into German with all of the dialogue delivered in fine BhnenDeutsch.  Hispanics may do likewise by listening to ancient Greeks and Persians in Castellano.  (The Region A Blu-ray and the 2004 Region 1 DVD have audio in both English and Spanish.)",1407974400,3,2426,4.823671497584541

1852476,2,B00008MTWI,"The story of how 300 Spartans sacrificed themselves at Thermopylae in the battle against Persia here becomes an only mildly interesting film, though it has its merits: Sir Ralph Richardson gives a good performance as the great Athenian statesman Themistocles, the landscape photography is impressive, and there's a very good score by noted Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis. But these can't save the film from its wooden acting in most roles, a trite script, pedestrian direction, and an unconvincing and obviously tacked on romantic interest in the form of a pair of young star-crossed Spartan lovers.

All in all, I'd say this movie would be of interest to people particularly interested in Ancient Greece or in the Hollywood sword-and-sandal epic genre. Others are likely to find it watchable but forgettable. (Triva note: it's the only movie I can think of in which the script includes a few lines of ancient Greek.)

1852492,4,B00008MTWI,"This is a film that I can give a solid B to B+ for effort, historical portrayal, etc.  Granted the costuming is often odd or cheesy, the love story has substandard acting and script, and when we saw the Persian camp near Thermopylae we were amazed by the bright pastel tents.  Wow, that must be where the artist Christo got the idea for his Yellow Umbrella landscape displays.

However, in usefulness lies in illuminating the incredible stand the Spartans made at Thermopylae and much of its' historical / political background.  Unlike some reviewers I don't demand full historical accuracy or political correctness from any film.  It is a bonus to get close to the truth when watching a historical film...which was also meant to entertain and make profits for the studio.  Film-makers are artists and all artists seek to portray reality in a creative form and reflect their own individuality.

So... the history is close and the film portrays a fascinating episode from history with out the aid of CGI, over the top gore, and immorality (the dancing girls are tame enough and the temptation of the lovers is brief and basically chaste).  I was particularly pleased with the political interaction leading up to the Spartans departure for Thermopylae.  Themistocles role is succint and well-played.  The overall situation that led to the ""sacrifice"" of the 300 becomes clear.  They were UA Flight 93 passengers and were determined to do damage control so that their countrymen had a chance of avoiding enslavement by the Persians.  Themistocles reminded me of Winston Churchill leading into WWII.  He grasped the situation, fought for the truth to be made known, and was pro-active about a possible solution.  His naval battle at Salamis, which falls outside the scope of this film, put the nail in the coffin for the Persian King Xerxes' army of millions.

In terms of educational value this film rates rather highly.  Not every detail is correct, but neither is any historical account one reads.  All accounts have a bias of some sort and the astute reader attempts to discover these before accepting all that is written.  Personally, I enjoy a good historical or semi-historical film...and then look up the subject on Wikipedia to find out where the story differs (I even remember when I looked things up in the encyclopedia set that sat on the shelf).

Enjoy the film with viewers aged perhaps 12 and up and have fun with the details.  I thought King Xerxes robes looked like they came straight out of a high school play.  Don't be put off by not learning a great deal about the ""real"" Spartan culture or semi-realistic battles.

1852495,4,B00008MTWI,"What can I say? I much preferred this version to the rubbish Frank Miller/Zack Snyder 'Bombs over Tehran' propaganda. Sure the acting was cheesy and OTT. Sure the costumes, especially those of the Spartans (look at those helmets- those are supposed to be Corinthian helmets??)weren't the best, the sets look like Star Trek cardboard sets, and the close combat scenes were lame. But consider this- the Persians were actually depicted as being human. They had motivations, they had family members(2 of Xerxes' brothers died at Thermopylae), they cared for their womenfolk(but not for their slave troops' women, apparently). The costumes were quite accurate, especially Mardonius and the regular Persian and Medes line infantry. The Immortals' costumes may have been stretching it(they wore colorful costumes, looked like the Persian infantry in '300'), but they at least had wicker shields, wore soft head coverings (the tall helmets and black uniforms were purely for visual effect to contrast against the Spartans' red cloaks- long before the Japanese movie 'Heaven and Earth' depicting Takeda Shingen's famous rivalry with Uesugi Kenshin, where vast samurai armies in black and red lacquered armor clashed), had bows and used weighted spears. Not like Frank 'I Hate Middle Eastern Terrorists' Miller's ridiculous ninja demon 'Immortals'.

Hydarnes here was a professional soldier who, while following orders, did his best to defend his soldiers, advise Xerxes against doing stupid things, and tried to salvage the situation. The Persians used cavalry and chariots. They didn't have African mumakil, war rhinos or ogres.

The Spartans were suitably macho, they didn't need to look lke UFC fighters, these were actual members of the Hellenic Army, Leonidas was stoic without needing to growl and shout all the time. And hey, Frank Miller adopted the design of some of the higher ranking Persian officers for his graphic novel, like Hydarnes and the Persian officer who offers the surviving Spartans one last chance to surrender.

And it wasn't just 300 Spartans. There were helot javelin throwers and archers too. Not just a bunch of UFC dudes in leather speedos. The only thing Zack Snyder got right was the phalanx shield push, and I still preferred the version shown in 'Troy'.

All in all, not too bad. It's nice to see movies where the 'other side' at least has a human face.

1852501,3,B00008MTWI,"This version of the Spartan stand at Thermopalyae is historically more accurate than 300 which came out in 2007. 300 does have the better special effects, after all, it's 45 years later. The 300 Spartans was my first experience with this famous battle, as a child I thoroughly enjoyed it. Sadly, I'm now an adult, this film doesn't have the same impact on me. Richard Egan, a second tier star at best, as Leonidas is barely adequate. But I will be honest, the script is stiff, not giving the best lines for the actors to deliver. But as far as the story goes it's fairly accurate to the historical events of the battle.

The basic story is that the Persians are invading Greece with one of the largest armies ever assembled up to that time. Xerxes (David Farrar) is bent on conquering the Greeks but the why isn't mentioned nor is his character given much room to develop, this is an action-adventure film. The Greeks decide in a Senate style meeting that a holding action must be done in order to give themselves enough time to muster their armies. It must be understood, at this time, Greece wasn't a unified country, they were a loose confederation of City-States headed by their own king & not always willing to cooperate with one another. Once all of this is decided, etc., King Leonidas of Sparta is approached & convinced he is the needed buffer between the Persians & Greeks. In essence, Thermopylae is The Greeks version of the Alamo; here they'll stand in order to preserve the Greek democracy. Unfortunately, the Spartans are in the midst of a religious festival & can't go to battle. Leonidas, in order to circumvent the festival, names 300 Spartans as his personal bodyguard.

The selection of Thermopylae as a defensive position was a stroke of genius & luck. It is a very narrow stretch of beach with water on one side & high, unscalable cliffs on the other. This forces the Persians to attack in piecemeal, never able to throw their entire army into battle in mass. The Spartans were probably the first truly professional army in the world which gave them a great advantage on this narrow strip of land. The movie focuses on the 300 Spartans but they weren't the only Greeks there. They are others mentioned & shown in the movie but their presence doesn't have much to do with the film. This is the Spartans' heroic stand against a superior force, fighting to preserve democracy. What's barely mentioned is the navy the Greeks were assembling in order to cut off the Persians. The Greeks needed time to do this also, in fact, not long after the Battle of Thermopylae, there was a naval battle where the Greeks succeeded in defeating the Persian navy, thereby cutting them off from supplies & an escape route. Themistocles (Sir Ralph Richardson) is basically the brains behind it all & the leader of the Greek navy.

The 300 Spartans is a so-so movie once you get past the dialog. It's also easier to take as a story than it's more famous 300. I consider this film to be a better & more historically accurate version of the Spartans stand than 300 though the special effects are miles apart.",1214524800,4,3106,4.633393829401089

It's in between an A and B movie - Cinemasope, color and location shooting are the ""A"" part, mid-level actors and budget are limiting factors. The love story is a bit of a tack on, but it is handled reasonably well.

Notably, this is a fairly accurate account of the battle and the events that led up to it. The Greeks did ultimately defeat the Persians under Xerxes, and this was a key event in western history.

I actually like that that movie did not have a blockbuster budget, the battle has to be shown on a small scale, making it more personal. Note the final scene, which is historically accurate. If you are an American, you might remember the Alamo.

Well worth it if you like this this sort of movie. For the more casual viewer, try ""Cleopatra"", (Elizabeth Taylor, ca. 1963), or ""Spartacus"", also ca. 1963.

1852522,3,B00008MTWI,"Way back in the 1960's, before the advent of VHS/DVD or cable, each of the three networks had their own ""Night At The Movies"" broadcast, with NBC being the first network to do so, I believe. These movies provided many truly great films with their network TV debuts. These airings were the first showings of these great movies that many Baby Boomers ever saw. I first saw the best Hitchcock films (REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, THE BIRDS, NORTH BY NORTHWEST) on NBC Saturday Night At The Movies, along with many of the golden age westerns of the 1950's.

CBS and ABC soon followed suit, but I believe it was on NBC in the mid-1960's where I first saw THE 300 SPARTANS. My brother and I remembered it through the years as being a good movie, but having just rented it on DVD, I could only say that the movie overall was average at best. What drags the movie down most is the lack of action during the first 2/3 of the movie and the aforementioned soapy subplot, a la Kate & Leo in TITANIC, that was no doubt inserted to interest the younger audience and females in general. A good musical score can truly help an action movie, but this film and the little action that exists towards the end is accompanied by a less-than-stellar soundtrack.

Although the cast contained Sir Ralph Richardson and Laurence Naismith, most of the acting is less inspired. I always enjoy Richard Egan, but I feel that he exudes more natural charisma than true acting skills as the Spartan King Leonidas. Barry Coe is especially bad as Diane Baker's love interest, but this was one of his very first roles and I believe he grew somewhat as an actor, as did Baker. Director Rudolph Mate was chiefly known for his skill as a cinematographer, and this is where the movie shines. It is a beautiful film to look at and was filmed very close to where the actual events occurred.

The fact that the film was made in 1961 (released in 1962) is no excuse for the average results. Compare THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, SPARTACUS, BEN-HUR, KING OF KINGS, all made before this film. It is obvious that comparatively speaking, this project had a somewhat limited budget (the B-movie cast alone bears that out), which is truly sad, since it was made by a major studio, 20th-Century Fox, was filmed on location in Greece (a much bigger deal back then than it would be today, and a fact that likely used up most of the budget), and saddest of all, the true story was worthy of first-class cinematic treatment, which it certainly does not get here.

The definitive version of the story of the Battle at Thermopylae may have yet to be made, but 300 is very entertaining and will certainly do until a more realistic and less fantastical version is made.  It would be unfair to compare that film and this one but not very unfair to compare other similar films made in the 1950's and 1960's and in doing that, THE 300 SPARTANS is average at best.",1176854400,7,2884,4.517241379310345

1852525,4,B00008MTWI,"""300"" (2007), arguably a remake of ""The 300 Spartans"" (1962), should renew interest in this original version. Is a film that is based on a comic book series inspired by the 1962 movie, that covers the same events from the same point of view, and that uses almost the same title a remake? Technically it is, but then the same point could be made about almost every film centered around the ""Battle of Little Big Horn"".

The 1962 film was hardly a Hollywood epic on the scale of ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) but it had a respectable budget, some large battle scenes, and a professional production design. I saw it in the theater and still have a copy (somewhere) of John Burke's mass-market paperback that was released concurrently with the film. The ""Three Stooges Meet Hercules"" only merited a comic book.

""The 300 Spartans"" is a simplistic but generally accurate account of the events leading up to and the actual battle at a pass called Thermopylae (basically a narrow road with the mountains on one side and the sea on the other).

King Xerxes had invaded Greece with a massive army but had to funnel his forces through the pass. Greece was made up of hundreds of independent city-states that were not used to cooperating with each other. The most militaristic of them being Sparta and the most nautical being Athens. King Leonidas of Sparta (Richard Egan) was able to reach the pass before Xerxes but he brought only his personal bodyguard of 300 Spartans. He was supported by a few thousand soldiers from other Greek cities and by the fleet from Athens (Athens gets no credit in the film which also fails to explain that almost half of Greece had allied with Xerxes). Eventually Xerxes is able to outflank the Spartans and their allies but much like the events at the Alamo, the holding action buys time to organize an effective resistance to the invasion. The film is quite stirring and inspirational in a one-sided propaganda sort of way.

Diane Baker provides the romantic interest and also vaguely illustrates how the women of Sparta enjoyed an almost unprecedented power within their society (bet you didn't know that).

Egan (best remembered as Elvis' older brother in ""Love Me Tender"") has an acting style much like that of William Shatner. Sir Ralph Richardson plays his Athenian adversary and he raises the film's acting level several notches. Neither of these guys was exactly a box office draw which fit a film that was not epic in cast or in budget.

Much like that three-hour opus Midway, there is a romantic subplot completely out of tone with the rest of the film. Diane Baker, who can really act mind you, seems to be channeling a beach party movie in her ill-advised love interest role.

Luckily for the viewer it's all swords and sandals after the first half. For a sixties movie the battles are very well done indeed. The armies are large and the extras are plentiful. The battle is also creative in its use of fire and arrows. This isn't a two guys fighting to the death with fake swords Italian job. This is a battle of entire armies clashing on the screen.

The location shooting in Greece proper is also a beautiful plus. The sets on the other hand are right out of the original Star Trek series almost to the point you expect Kirk and Spock to pop in any moment violating the prime directive. (This might explain why a Persian commander exclaims the Spartans fight like machines. Machines in ancient Greece? Must have escaped from the zoo.)

There is also the hilariously historically inaccurate braying about freedom from the Spartan commander. (In reality Sparta was a model for Nazi Germany. And their views on slaves and slave labor would have made a Confederate general blush.) In actuality the Persians foes were the more enlightened of the two.

But I am nit picking. As long as one can get past the romance, stop expecting Klingons to pop in at any moment and enjoy the hour-long battle at the end. 300 Spartans is a well-done ride.",1169078400,15,1639,4.602739726027397

But hey, if you are basing the movie on that, and not the historical importance of this battle, then this movie would be a flop.  Historically, battle-wise, it seems pretty accurate.  Well, at least accurate in the fact we don't really know what happened on those days.  We just rely on writings of people who probably were not there.  Sure, the Persians recorded some.  And the Greeks heard stories of what happened from those who survived.  History is full of half-truths.  Ok, let us assume Herodotus is right - then the battle scenes are pretty good and accurate.

With money boiling a hole in my pocket and in desperate search of some Ancient Rome/Greek movies, I picked up this one. I initially thought it was 44.95!!! Turns out it was just a trick of the plastic cage-thingy protecting it from theft, that made the 1 look like 4. Same thing with the store's copy of ""Spartacus"" which I didn't buy because I somehow thought it was 44.95 and that it was a bit of a ripoff (I'm a little crazy) So I bought this at the last moment, and wasted some but not much time watching it. I was very impressed with the cinematography considering this was a movie from the 60s, and the costumes were very realistic. As expected, all the Greeks (and Xerxes) had British accents, and Xerxes was very un-Persian looking and sounding. Still, I was a bit impressed with the rapid pace of the movie without rushing too badly, and the very dedicated acting.

Then as the movie went on, I kind of did that face that goes :S First off, the music was terrible (but I don't hold it against it, since all Ancient Rome/Greece movies from the 60s and such had really whiny, tinny brass instruments that were very un-Roman/un-Greek sounding.) Then came Leonidas. First, they mispronounced his name, I think (I'm sure his name is pronounced ""Lee-oh-ny-dus"", whereas they all pronounced it ""Lee-oh-nee-dus""), and he had an American ACCENT!! Omg, after getting sick and tired of people who bitched about 2004's ""Alexander"" with the Greeks having Irish accents, imagine my surprise to hear Spartans talk with American accents. Most of the Spartans had American accents, with some varying between British and American seemingly randomly.

After Athens allied with Sparta to pin the Persians at Thermopylae, the movie slugged to a virtual halt for a whole 20 minutes or so, with Leonidas constantly talking about Thermopylae, but no one doing anything, and some Spartan kid being disgraced and kicked out of the army.

Once they finally reached Thermopylae (and the Spartan kid (kid about 30 years old) earning his spot back in the army to fight the suicide mission), the movie started to pick up again. I was very impressed in how the movie kept itself reined in to realism, when it appeared about to slip into mad-Hollywood-action-movie chaos. Rather than make the situation appear heroic, with only 300 Spartans, they did point out and make it a priority to tell the audience that the Spartans were not alone. Greeks (mostly from Thespia) had also joined them.

The battle sequences were done pretty well considering it was the 60s. The one thing I hate about old movie battles is that they always show battle sequences sans music at all. So the battle sequences had no music unless something dramatic was happening to shift the battle. The Phalanx was all wrong, however, with the Spartan spears being VERY short--too short for a successful phalanx--and held over their shoulders like throwing spears. Many of the Spartans resorted to sword-fighting as soon as they met the Persian infantry. However, rather than have the Spartans break off and start going ""Gladiator"" one-man-army on the Persians, they held position and moved as a unit. I was very impressed by this realistic approach. (Side note, there was no Dienekes, so they made Leonidas say that legendary quote ""If the arrows of the Medes blot out the sun, we shall have our fight in the shade"" along with some other clever, very Spartan remarks to the Persian commander when ordered to surrender.)

The ending however was anti-climactic. As the Spartans sent the Greeks home and prepared to fight to the death, there was no music at all, and when the final battle occurred, when Leonidas was killed, they played some annoying blatty brass music. Then it ended. Then the rest of the scene consisted of the Spartans bunching together with shields up, a Persian commander ordering the archers to shoot them down, and all the Spartans being killed without even moving or even trying to block, and no music. As soon as the last Spartan dropped dead, the narrator came back to tell us of what would happen next, with the Athenian fleet crushing Xerxes later on at Salamis. And it was over, after reiterating the famous quote ""Go and tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here, obedient to their laws we lie."" except that the narrator said it all wrong and weirdy, like ""Stranger passing by, go tell the Spartans we're lying here.""

All in all, it was pretty lousy by our standards, but for a movie of the 60s, it was probably bordering on the below average.  It gets a C+ for effort.  At least they pronounced most of the names correctly. And the DVD cover was very pretty.",1159488000,5,4650,4.77363184079602

This is an exciting movie about the epic Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans and the Spartan king Leonidas died fighting an overwhelming force of Persians.

1852542,4,B00008MTWI,"I remember this movie from my childhood.  At the time I thought it was the greatest thing ever.  Years later and having read more I see the movie is what it is; a Hollywood production.  It's not entirely accurate but it does follow the narrative.

A simple guideline of the story is thus; the the Great Persian King Xerxes invades the city states of Greece.  They decide to fight but can't decide how and of course time is needed to raise the army.  They decide on a defense action at the pass of Thermopylae.  They look to the Spartans but they won't move until a holy festival is finished.  The Spartan King Leonidas recognizes the danger and marches forth with his body guard of 300.  Along the way he picks up another 6-7000 Greeks and the tiny army faces a Persian army of 100000.

The battle rages on and with better weapons and army.  Better tactics and a narrow pass made the Greek Hoplite Phalanx almost unbeatable.  The Greeks inflict numerous losses and look like they will win until a traitor shows the Persians another pass which allows them to send a force to attack the Greeks from both sides.  Leonidas decides to stand and he and the remaining Greeks(he sent away many of the allies) are annihilated.

Even though the Battle is a loss; it serves to inspire the Greeks and it shattered the view of Persian invincibility.

The acting of the film can be argued as somewhat wooden but it is  product of its time.

There are some goofs in the film.  Look to the Javelins as the Spartans throw them at the Immortals.  They are blunt and you can see some guys dropping their weapons to catch them!

The DVD says it has special features but they are nothing really interesting.  You get movie clips, 3 TV spots, a theater trailer and the theater trailer in Spanish.

Overall, it's still a good film.

1852546,4,B00008MTWI,"This flick is a very good effort at telling the story of the 300 Spartans who died defending the pass at Thermopylae (as it has come down to us) against the Persians.

I am always a bit amused at reviewers that 'measure' and slam ancient peoples, events and times using their modern 'yardsticks'! Most Greeks around that period both admired and feared the Spartans. Were the Spartans ruthless? Sure! But the Spartans were only MORE ruthless and militarily astute than other Greeks at the time and shouldn't be singled out for any particular 'knocking'. It was a different world; with different morals and values. It was a dog-eat-dog world of almost constant warfare between all the various Greek city-states. The Spartans simply evolved into the recognized top-dog. Since only free Spartans could serve in the army and the army is estimated to never have been more than 8-10,000 at the height of Sparta's power, diplomacy was always exhausted before going to war. When war was decided upon, up to half the army had to remain at home, to put down potential revolts by their slaves, the Helots, who had a habit of rebelling when the army was away. Sparta simply couldn't afford to lose many men in battle, and so, was actually reluctant to go to war. But when they did go to war... the other fella had better watch out!! In the movie King Leonidis receives word that the Spartan Council decided to fortify the Isthmus of Corinth instead of following him to Northern Greece (thus dooming the 300 Spartans). The decision is never explained in the movie, and the viewer is left with the impression that the council 'screwed' Leonidis and his troops. In reality, it was a very pregmatic move since the Isthmus is just a day or two forced march from home, allowing the army a quick response if the slaves revolted. It was Leonitis who ignored the council and took it upon himself to march north with his personal body guard. It is fortunate for 'western civilization' as we know it today that the Spartans (and around 7000 other Greeks) held Thermopylae and delayed Darius and the Persians long enough for the Greek cities to rally and eventually defeat them. It is a tribute to their bravery and sense of duty that the 300 Spartans (and 700 Thespians) died defending the pass to delay the Persians until the other Greeks were able to retreat from the trap.

There is a Greek saying attributed to Spartan women who saw their husbands and sons off to war. Women gave the shield to their men and told them... ""With this, or on it!"" Since the shield was the heaviest part of any soldier's armour, if things went badly during a battle and they had to exit the field in a hurry, the shield was the first thing thrown away in flight. The saying meant for the men to come home with victory ('with this shield') or dead ('on it') as shields were commonly used as battlefield 'stretchers'. This 'hardcore' attitude was very real, since a woman's stature in Spartan society, and especially among other Spartan women, was linked directly to her husband's/son's performance and bravery in battle.

To a Spartan, prowess in battle was everything... understandable in a martial society. All energies were directed toward supporting and securing the state, so agriculture and the arts were considered 'unmanly' occupations and had no real place in their culture. Note in the movie the statement about the Spartan mother that killed her own son when she saw he had a wound in his back.",1135123200,8,3463,4.7301324503311255
1852547,2,B00008MTWI,"They COMPLETELY destroyed any sense of who the Spartans really were, they made the Spartans Americans who are going off to defend for the greater good, for peace and liberty etc etc.

In reality the Sparta was a supremely military society, all males strong enough were trained from birth to be soldiers, those not WERE THROWN OFF OF A CLIFF. They did no agricultural work themselves, they had enslaved a neighbouring nation to do all the agricultural work for them and declared war on those slaves (Helots) each year so it was not a crime to kill them.

The finer work was done by workers (Perioikoi or 'Neighbours') but the Spartans still considered them inferior to themselves. They couldn't care any less if they lived or died, they were purely there as labourers and were sub-humans to them.

They had brutal religious festivals wherein often several participants died.

Honor went above anything, Spartans would rather die then loose their honor. A tale about that is that a boy stole a fox from someone and to keep it hidden kept it under his cloak, the animal bit and scratched him and he bled to death but he never flinched and had kept his honor till death, which was the most important of all. When something was stolen the crime was not the theft itself but being caught, and considered weak and a disgrace (and those people became outcasts)

Women would rather their husbands die in battle then come back defeated (with his shield or on it)and homosexual relationships between the men was strongly encouraged to strengthen the bond between them during battle to make them even more fierce and loyal to each other. Marriage and love was also long not as important as showed in the film, homosexual relationships were in-fact considered a higher form of sexuality then heterosexuality.

The events during the battle were portrayed correctly in the film but the Spartans were portrayed as a UN force or something like that, totally butchering their controversial, brutal, yet interesting society.

The movie shows a classic 'the Persians are the bad guys, but you can't have bad fighting bad and then one win so lets just make the Spartans nice, cuddly and good' while by our standards today the Spartans were just as much barbarians living in something you could compare to a Hitler regime as the Persians were.

Now I'm not saying it's not a good watch, it's a fun movie, even though it's old, the battle sequences were well done. But knowing what the Spartans were really like and having researched it and seeing Hollywood portraying them like this is just pain-full.

1852548,3,B00008MTWI,"This is an older movie, and that means a few things. It may come off as a little campy to younger viewers. There are no big special effects, no CGI, no elaborate sets. The acting and direction is typical of movies 40 years ago - not slick, and lacking in the intensity you would might find in a movie like Gladiator  The Spartans looks surprsingly un-athletic in comparison to the buff actors you's find in Troy or Alexander. It's a little like watching a play that was filmed.

All that said, it is what it is: an old movie about the battle of Thermopylae. And if you love watching any movie you can get your hands on about Ancient Greek history, you'll probably get a kick out of it. And I'm not aware of any other film adaptation of the battle, so it may be all there is out there.",1127433600,3,784,4.22
1852559,5,B00008MTWI,"This 1962 excellent historical drama takes us back to Ancient Greek Times during the Persian Wars. It's the  very known and yet inspiring, titanic struggle of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians, under Spartan king Leonidas's (Richard Egan) leadership in Thermopylae, versus the huge army of Persian King Xerxes, who attempted to bring to an end the freedom of the independent Greek States, incorporating them  within his vast empire and become world's ruler. Although it ended in victory for the Persians, the battle is noted primarily for the bravery shown by the Greeks and, in particular, by the Spartans and their king, Leonidas I, who won eternal fame as the ultimate symbol of the heroic death.

""The 300 Spartans"" revives the Battle of Thermopylae in this unfortunately not very known production of 20th Century Fox. Rudolph Mat both directed and scripted the movie brilliantly. The usual prerequisites of impressive costumes and sets and massive battle sequences that all Hollywood epics circa the mid '50s to late '60s had,  are all present in this film, but unlikely to other  contemporary  ""historical"" films the script is historically very accurate inspired from Greek history. The battle scenes, filmed in their original location in Greece, are well made for it's time and hundreds soldiers of the Royal Greek Army take part as extras.

Manly Richard Egan holds the main role of King Leonidas and replies, in perfect Greek ""Molon Lave""(come and take it) to Persian threats. Sir Ralph Richardson as Themistocles, and David Farrar as ruthless Xerxes, give memorable performances. Also note Anna Synodinou, a great Greek tragedian actress, in the role of Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo. Handsome Barry Coe (Philo) and lovely Diane Baker (Hellas) play a young couple of Spartans in love. The problems begin when they learn that Philo's father is collaborating with the Persians along with the exiled ex-king of Sparta and Xerxes's military advisor, Demaratos.  This love story although fictional, adds a romantic tune to the whole plot. Kieron Moore stars as repulsive Ephialtes, the Greek traitor, who advised Xerxes that by following a mountain path the Persians could outflank the Greek forces.

Manos Hadjidakis conducted a wonderful melodious musical score for this movie.

I hope that a likely new movie about the Battle of Thermopylae will be more  better or at least will match, this spectacular but quiet old, epic.",1122681600,15,2425,5.176470588235294
1852560,3,B00008MTWI,"As a student of classical history I enjoyed watching The 300 Spartans. The costumes were above par for the era in which it was made and the photography wasn't half bad. The Greek locations the film was shot in were nice to look at as well.

However, the filmmakers should have fired their technical advisor. The Greek phalanx--a fixture of ancient warfare--was somehow overlooked. The troops line up shoulder to shoulder in thin, widely separated ranks like a skirmish line and, when the battle is joined, duke it out one-on-one, which just didn't happen in the ancient world (hard to have an Errol Flynn swordfight with a xiphos).

The Spartans also give very stirring speeches that sound more like George Washington material than something Leonidas would have said. The democratic gloss given to these Spartans is a major faux pas--I actually laughed at it a couple times. The filmmakers apparently didn't know about the helots. Also, the Spartans in this film just don't act very... Spartan... what with the young man and his bonnie lass gamboling about the countryside and whatnot.

I've spent a lot of time on the film's problems, but for what it's worth I was entertained. This was a nice break from what is offered these days and I may go back and watch it again sometime. For anyone who enjoyed this movie but knows nothing about Sparta/Thermopylae otherwise, check out Steven Pressfield's excellent piece of historical fiction Gates of Fire.",1116460800,14,1450,4.934426229508197
1852561,5,B00008MTWI,"At last, I watched a Hollywood film that tells the story the way it happened. The theme of the movie is the battle of Thermopylae, maybe the most important battle in the history of Europe. The Persian troups were delayed for 3 days by 300 Spartan warriors, led by Leonidas, at the narrow passage of Thermopylay (Gates of Fire). This gave time for the Athenians, Ionians, Corinthians, Macedonians and the rest of the Greeks to assemble the fleet and give the advancing Asian barbarians the final blow at Salamis.

The movie takes place on lacation, at a very scenic area, with many extras, performing excellent in man to man combat and chariot combat, too.

The classic phrases ""Molon Lave"", told by Leonidas to Xerxes and ""I tan i epi tas"", told by the Spartan mothers to their sons, are told, and explained in the movie.

The armor of the Spartan warriors is the historically accurate one, with the big Greek ""L"" on the front (standing for ""Lacedemoniis"" (Spartans in ancient Greek), they wear the red cloaks, (so no Spartan blood would be visible to the enemy). The daggers are of the correct size and not mistaken by the Sariza, and the battle cries are the appropriate ones.

The musical score is by Manos Hadjidakis, capturing the epic history in a bewildering way.

After all the ""historical"" epic - junk i watched lately, i was pleasantly surprised to watch this marvel that was filmed more than 40 years ago. Well done!",1114128000,26,1427,4.692
1852562,4,B00008MTWI,"Hampered by a somewhat lame script and perhaps not enough high wattage star power to head the cast, this epic is nevertheless quite watchable; based on actual events in the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae, where a King Leonides of Sparta held the vast Persian army of Xerxes I at bay for three days defending a narrow pass.
The battles are brilliantly staged with its 1001 extras, in massive mano a mano fights, as well as on horseback and in chariots.
A secondary plot consists of a young couple (Diane Baker and Barry Coe) in love against all odds, and are the diversion to an otherwise rather one-note story of Spartans/Greeks vs. Persians.

Richard Egan ably leads his men as Leonides the Lion King of Sparta, but somehow does not have the stature as an actor to really captivate our attention, and other actors include Ralph Richardson as Themistocles of Athens, and David Farrar as Xerxes I.
The cinematography by Geoffrey Unger (""2001: A Space Odyssey"") is spectacular, and the transfer to DVD excellent with rich reds in the costumes and the deepest of blue seas, and the score by Manos Hadjidakis (""Never on Sunday"") is marvelous and adds a lot to the film.
Director Rudolph Mate had a long career as a brilliant cinematographer going back to the silent film era with the 1928 masterpiece ""Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" to later films like ""Pride of the Yankees"", and this was to be his next to last film as a director.

One can learn history even from a Hollywood epic, as I never knew of the existence of Artemisia the Warrior Queen of Halicarnassus, here played by Anne Wakefield. When I first watched the film, I assumed she had been included to add some female pulchritude to the action, but upon some reading on the subject after viewing the film, learned she had ruled after her husband's death and was an ally to Xerxes I in 480 B.C., taking part in the Battle of Salamis, and cleverly maneuvering to safety when the battle was lost. Herodotus even gave her the rare praise of having ""the virtue of courage"", normally only bestowed on men, as it also meant ""manliness"".

Well worth watching for its historical accuracy, battle scenes, terrific costuming, beautiful scenery and score, so that though the film is not particularly involving, it has quite a lot to offer.

1852563,4,B00008MTWI,"""The 300 Spartans"" is the story of an impossible, yet inspiring, stand by 300 Greek soldiers against the greatest army in the ancient world. Richard Egan, a buff, second string matinee idol, is King Leonidas of Sparta. His attempts to back the full scope of his military in defence of Thermopylae is hampered by political squabbling. Undaunted, Leonidas sets out to destroy Persian king, Xerxes - all the while realizing just how futile his journey is and how tragic his destiny shall be. The usual prerequisites of half naked women and massively overdone battle sequences - that all Hollywood epics circa the mid 50s to late 60s had - are reinstated for this film. Visually, it's stunning. Dramatically: below par and very long on spectacle over substance.
TRANSFER: Fox gives us a very clean, very nice looking anamorphic transfer of this would be classic. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Contrast and black levels are dead on. There is some fading present during several night sequences. Film grain is noticeable but not distracting. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum. Digital anomalies (edge enhancement, pixelization) are present but do not distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely brings back the stereophonic appeal of classic Cinemascope movies. There's a sonic breadth to the musical score that does not extend to dialogue sequences.
EXTRAS: Theatrical trailers and a few TV spots. Big deal!
BOTTOM LINE: This is a movie for people who truly love and admire Hollywood epics. But it does not represent the height or even the best that the genre can offer. If you're starved for this sort of entertainment, I would recommend either ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Cleopatra"" over this film.",1109980800,,1689,5.01423487544484
1852564,5,B00008MTWI,"Finally after many years this old sword and sandal classic has been re-issued.  Like many viewers here I fist saw this film when I was a kid.  I liked it then, and I still enjoy it today.  For a movie it stays pretty close to the historical events.  Sure there is some B-class acting and a silly romance, but the portryal of the Spartans is pretty accurate.  The costumes and sets are very good.  The film looks like it was shot in Greece, or some locale very similar in appearence.  Once we get past the slow beginng the action picks up as the Spartans make their immortal stand at the pass.  Both Xerxes and Leonidas are well portrayed in my opinion.  This is one movie that does not have to resort to bizarre heroics in order to get the message across that the Spartans were brave.  The combat scenes are exciting and well done.  The Cold War probably inspired the making of this film, with its obvious overtones to current events at that time.  This is one old classic that holds up well over the years.  Glad the studios finally got over the legal battle to release this one again.",1105315200,16,1086,4.37
1852565,4,B00008MTWI,"I have fond memories of seeing this movie often in my youth, back in the days when a character called Barry Lillis used to host WGRZ Buffalo's after-school ""Money Movie"". They used to devote a whole week at a time to the genre along with other classic sword'n'sandal epics like the Steve Reeves flicks, etc. While the historical accuracy of some of these movies may be questionable, I have to say they really opened up my young eyes to ancient history and sparked an interest which has stayed with me to this day.

Now watching this movie again for the first time in 25 years or so, like many other reviewers here it isn't quite as wonderful as I remembered. But compared to other Italian-made B-movie epics of the time, I would say this production with American, British, French and Greek involvement is still a cut above.

Richard Egan makes a decent Leonidas (--OK maybe a bit wooden, but hey it's a B-movie, right?), and keeps the film firmly anchored. But I did find the Shakespearean thespian British accents of some of the other actors made some of these ancient Greeks and Persians seem more like genteel English gentlemen to me (--in particular the actor playing Xerxes, whose blue eyes didn't help his believability either.) And then of course the filmmakers had to go and throw in a sappy love story that doesn't really serve any purpose.

Well, what can I say? If you go into this expecting a ""Gladiator"" or even a ""Ben Hur"", you'll probably be disappointed. But if you take it for what it is -- a typical early 60's grade-B sword'n'sandal flick -- you'll find it's a damned good one at that. Probably that's why there are so many of us who, even recognizing that the film is very much of its era and does have its shortcomings, are still so glad to finally have it available on DVD to own and watch anytime.

As for the DVD itself, they have done a beau~tiful job restoring the colours and it really looks great. And best of all the film is presented in wide-screen format, which is not done often enough in DVD releases of this type of movie. Don't expect too much in the way of extras (the English and Spanish trailers plus a few old B & W TV spots), but for me having this movie so respectfully restored and released in widescreen is reason enough to be happy.

I don't know....say what you will, but even though they're cheesy and dated, somehow I still think I'd rather watch one of these old sword'n'sandal type movies starring a Steve Reeves or a Richard Egan instead of one of today's big-budget, over-hyped ""blockbusters"" starring the latest overpaid ""hot stars"" of the day like Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom. Somehow they seem to have more of a soul to them.

Go and tell the Spartans!

You who do pass by!

I remember that some old time travel TV show used outakes from this film.  This is an imperfect film, almost childish I know but it was a great family film about a thrilling theme.

A little bit of Leonidas is with all of us today.  He was simply one of the greatest heroes of all time. This is a fun film. Along with JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS this was one of my favorite films of my boyhood. Today I realize Spartacus is better but as a kid I liked 300 Spartans more.  The basic story is so dramatic and so courageous that the hokey parts are forgiven and forgotten.  After all this is just a movie.  Enjoyable it is -and that's what movies are for. If it also sparks interest in Greek heritage and history so much the better.",1100908800,27,1193,4.042918454935623

In the tradition of the movies Hollywood liked to make in the early 1960s dealing with the ancient world, this film dwells on the topics of honor and loyalty.  Richard Egan is terrific as King Leonidas.  This film does a wonderful job explaining what happened in the famous battle in which 300 Spartans held off an entire Persian army of thousands at the Battle of Thermopalye Pass long enough for the Greeks to organize and prepare to repel the Persian invaders.  While I am not a sufficiently knowledgeable historian to know whether this film hews closely to historical accounts of what happened, the film tells a coherent story that is certainly based upon actual events.

While the acting in this film (other than Egan's) is not terrific, this is nevertheless a film that is suitable for the whole family to watch.  This is solid entertainment.

The epic story of some of the bravest men who ever lived fighting in their ancient Alamo would confuse many today, yet this is another parallel to the LOTR trilogy.  It is a story of men faced with an impossible task who put their lives and duty on the line for Greece.  This battle is one that determined the course of western civ and deservies all the attention it gets.

1852570,5,B00008MTWI,"'300 Spartans' is nothing if not a B movie. Production values were mediocre for the 60's and downright archaic for today. Acting was on a par with the old Steve Reeves 'Hercules' movies, that is to say wooden. But '300 Spartans,' as poorly made as it was, tells a marvelous story.

 I first read the story of Leonidas at Thermopylae over 45 years ago in volume 8 of Collier's 'The New Junior Classics: Stories from History,' and that became the germ of a lifelong interest in ancient history and pregunpowder military history. I next met Leonidas in the pages of J.B. Bury's 'A History of Greece,' and A.R. Burns' 'Persia and the Greeks,' and I've recently renewed my acquaintance in Peter Greene's 'The Greco-Persian Wars' and Ernle Bradford's 'Thermopylae.' All of those books save the first can be purchased from Amazon.com. A public domain reprint of the first may be available from Amazon.com under the title 'Stories from Greece and Rome, Junior Classics Part 3.'

 In brief, the story of Leonidas:

 As Xerxes (aka Ahasueras), the Great King of the greatest empire the world had ever seen, prepared the greatest invasion force ever mustered, the Greeks sought advice from the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle pronounced that wooden walls would save Athens, but only the death of a Spartan king would save that unwalled city from ruin.

 As the Persian juggernaut crossed over a two mile long pontoon bridge into Europe and began its relentless march into Greece, the Greeks temporized, argued, and dithered. Finally, Sparta sent King Leonidas with three hundred Spartiates to hold the pass at Thermopylae against the Persian hordes. Leonidas stiffened his contingent with Helots (Spartan serfs) and volunteers from several other Greek city-states. Phocis, Thebes, Thespia, and a few others swelled Leonidas' ranks to a few thousand.

 Upon being told that when the Persians loosed their arrows the sky went black, the Spartiate Dienekes rejoined ""Then we shall fight in the shade."" At a point in the pass no more than 20 yards wide Leonidas met the Persians and stopped them dead in their tracks. For three days he and his men held the mightiest empire's mightiest army at bay, slaughtering the flower of the Persian army by the hundreds, if not thousands. He might have held, but a traitorous Greek showed the Persians a mountain pass by which they could turn Leonidas' position.

 Leonidas had guarded the pass with 1,000 Phocians, but the Persian 'Immortals,' Xerxes' best unit, brushed them aside. Upon learning of this treachery, Leonidas sent the other city-states' contingents home and prepared for his last stand. The Thebans and Thespians volunteered to stay, and Leonidas chose for his battleground a wider section of the pass. He wanted as wide a front as possible so he could kill as many Persians as possible.

 The Spartans joined battle with the Persians for the last time, and the slaughter was horrific. When, as anticipated, the Immortals took them in the rear, the Spartans retreated to a hillock, formed what the Middle Ages would call a 'Swiss Hedgehog,' and died to the last man.

 As prophecy foretold, the Spartans lost their king, but saved their city, and the rest of Greece with it. The invasion continued apace, and Athens was sacked, with her entire population fleeing to the island of Salamis. There in the straits between Salamis and Athens, the Greeks lured the Persian navy to its doom. Later, on the plains of Plataea, Sparta avenged the death of their king by slaughtering the Persian army and ending once and for all the Persian threat.

 '300 Spartans' follows this plot remarkably well, failing only in authenticity of detail. In the light of modern depictions of pregunpowder battle in movies like 'Ran,' 'Braveheart,' and 'Gladiator,' the battle scenes were near laughable, but we must remember the budgetary and special effects limitations of a 60's era B movie.

 The movie got more right than it did wrong: The dithering of the Greeks, the insanity of Leonidas' march, the gritty determination and martial excellence of the Spartiate soldiers, the hubris of Xerxes, the death by archery of the Spartiates as they formed a Swiss Hedghog for their final stand, but most of all the heroic person of Leonidas the king who willingly laid down his life to save his city-state and all of Greece with it.

 Richard Egan is probably best known for his portrayal of the villianous gladiator who was Victor Mature's foe in 'Demetrius and the Gladiators.' He makes a better villian than he does a hero, but there was still something very engaging in his portrayal of the heroic but doomed Spartan King.",1091577600,50,4636,4.9318766066838045
1852571,4,B00008MTWI,"1961 film on the defiant stand at the pass of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. by Spartans against the Persian hordes of Xerxes. Although a 'B' movie not unlike the 1963 version of 'Jason and the Argonauts', the film makes decent attempts towards accuracy and reflecting the norms and values of each culture.

  The film follows the general historical facts pretty accurately. To avenge his father Darius' humiliating defeat at Marathon, King Xerxes of Persia prepares a major invasion of the Greek mainland with a gigantic army of over 100,000 men: the largest ever assembled up to that time in antiquity. Upon the Persians crossing the Hellespont into the Greek mainland, the Greek city states meet and discuss what to do next. King Leonidas of Sparta (Richard Egan) calls for an avant garde contingent to delay the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae (The Hot Gates), a narrow mountain pass so called because of the hot geysers nearby. A protracted battle there would delay the Persians and give the Greek cities time to mobilize and prepare their defenses. Debate ensues but Leonidas knows there's no time to waste. Ignoring a Spartan holiday's restrictions on fighting, Leonidas heads out with a group of his own bodyguard of 300 hoplites to the mountain pass: inspired by the Spartans' bravery, other Greek cities contribute a force of approximately 6000 men.

  At Thermopylae, the Greeks hold a narrow pass with a smaller force, giving them the most favorable position for a defense. The small plain leading to the pass had the topography of a trapezoid covering a very small area with mountains on two sides and cliffs to the sea on the other. The terrain offering limited maneuverability, the Greek hoplites defeat the poorly organized foreign army several times: the Persians being primarily adept at cavalry and archery were ill-prepared to fight in close quarters with heavy infantry formations such as the Greek phalanx. The Greeks armed with heavy armor, large metal shields, and long spears were much better equipped than the Persians who barely wore any armor and carried wicker shields. Victory almost seems plausible but the majority of the Greek army chooses to retreat and prepare better defenses; with their departure, only Leonidas and his 300 hoplites remain to hold the Persians back. After being betrayed and encircled, the remaining Spartans choose to stand their ground and fight to the bitter end.

  As shown in the film, the battle was a phyrric victory for the Persians that cost them many lives as well as the initiative. Although Xerxes would later exact revenge by plundering the Greek countryside and burning Athens, the Persian fleet's destruction by the Athenians at Salamis effectively cut off the main army from future supplies or reinforcements. In desperate straits, the Persian ground forces were finally crushed at Plaetea. The Persians would never again attempt an invasion of Greece; instead, the Greeks (with memories of Xerxes still in their collective psyche) eventually conquered Persia under Alexander The Great a century-and-a-half later. As for Thermopylae, the original stone plaque placed in memory of the brave Spartans who so valiantly stood their ground is still there today 2500 years later.

  The film does a good job at contrasting both the Greeks and Persians in terms of their cultures and military traditions such as social structure; political organization; as well as military discipline.  The story shows how the Greeks and even the Spartans were endowed with a sense of equality while the Persians were not. Greek aristocrats were more first-among- equals as opposed those in Persia who clearly distinguished themselves from those they ruled and were bound to do the King's bidding on a moment's notice.  The sense of equality was a product of the independent city-state that was governed by a constitutional government and written laws. Even Sparta's dual monarchy was a constitutional one. Persia on the other hand was the largest known empire: its boundaries spreading from Egypt to India. Its kings were very much like the pharaos of Egypt: absolute monarchs vested with divine powers to rule through a feudal system of noble vassals and their retainers. The Persian king was inviolate and would dispense with laws and his subjects on a whim: his word was law and to disobey or disappoint him could mean a cruel death by a method pleasing to his fancy.

In terms of military organization, the film shows how Greeks treated war as a science instead of just a random display of power: there was high cohesion among the soldiers as they were free men collectively fighting for their homes.  In contrast, the Persian army was a mixed bag of vastly different cultures and fighting styles in which the king, not his generals, had supreme command even though he knew little about military strategy. Persian military organization and discipline was therefore lax with a very rigid top-to-bottom command structure: their camps were always accompanied by all sorts of fluff such as courtiers, entertainers, harems, relatives, and other useless baggage. The Greeks were, well, Spartan in comparison.  One error in the film is showing the Spartans throwing short spears.  Javelins and arrows were used by the Helot squires.  Spartan soldiers carried a 10-12 foot spear which they held over their shields to thrust and poke at the enemy: they didn't throw their spears as the phalanx would lose its effectiveness especially in a defensive engagement.

As far as social structures, the film improperly compares the two when it states that the conflict represented a fight between free men and a society of slaves serving a despot. The film fails to note that all societies in antiquity practiced slavery and that slaves in Greece were probably no better off than those in Persia. Furthermore, freedom in Greece was limited. Sparta was a military state ruled by a dual monarchy in which male and female citizens were all trained to be soldiers: its economy was entirey dependent on a large slave society (helots) to support the citizenry. In democratic cities such as Athens and Corinth, political suffrage was given only to adult men who were vested with property and usually born free in the city itself (the liberal enfranchizement of foreigners through broad grants of citizenship was a uniquely Roman concept): women, children, slaves, and foreigners had limited to non-existant rights.

  Again, this is a 1960's 'B' movie. The script is weighed with Cold War propaganda. Although many of the main actors are seasoned theatrical actors, most of the method actors playing secondary roles are pretty stiff. Despite these faults, the plot moves at a rather steady pace and has good action. The cinematography is quite good and the combat scenes are well choreographed. A good film to rent or own. I heard that Michael Mann is planning to adapt and direct Stephen Pressfield's book 'Gates of Fire' for film; I look forward to seeing a modern version of this epic battle.",1090800000,13,7025,5.063203463203463
1852572,4,B00008MTWI,"Here is a credible portrayal of the heroic stand that the 300 Spartans made at the pass of Thermopylae in 480BCE.  Trying to make their way through the pass was a Persian army that likely numbered around 200,000.  It was led by king Xerxes, son of Darius.
The Persians were set on conquering Greece, and Xerxes was out for revenge.  10 years earlier, in 490BCE Darius had launched an ill-fated invasion force that was turned back at Marathon.  This time, Xerxes believed he had a large enough army that the outcome of the war between Greece and Persia would not be in doubt.
Unfortunately for Xerxes, he had never faced a fighting force of the like fielded by the Spartans.  The valiant Lacedamons along with a handful of Greek coalition forces held the pass for the better part of 3 days.
 On the third day, the Spartan king Leonidas dismissed the rest of the Greek forces so that they would live to fight another day.  The Thespians declined to leave and they stayed and fought to a last man alongside the Spartans.
It is this obstinate and awe-inspiring battle that is depicted in the film.  All-in-all, it is quite well done and does a reputable job of introducing most of the major characters in the period such as Themosticles, Leonidas, Xerxes, Mardonious, Aspasia and Ephialtes.
The best part of the film lies in its authenticity regarding Spartan battle dress and weaponry.  In the film the Spartan shields have an upside down ""V,"" which was the symbol of the Homoioi (full citizens).  This was, in fact, what their shield depicted.
 The Laconians had a long (roughly 8 foot) spear + a short-sword, and this is what the actors wielded.  The Spartans also wore red to (supposedly) hide their blood, and this is accurately brought out in the film as well.
On the downside, there are a few weak parts of the script.  The most egregious is an anachronism;  Mardonious informs Xerxes that the Spartans ""fight like machines.""
There are also some directorial lapses and a few spots where armies are supposed to be in close combat and yet the extras move so slowly that you think they don't have a care in the world.  I rather doubt the tension at Thermopylae 2,500 years ago would allow for such insouciance.
The acting is fairly good.  Richard Egan gives a solid performance as the venerable Leonidas.  The Xerxes in the film is not, I would think, too far removed from the actual pompous king who invaded Greece all those centuries ago.
Aside from all that, the primary reason one should buy this DVD is that it is real history.  While some of it is fabricated and fudged, it is nevertheless an excellent representation of what really happened.  To this day, to commemorate those three days in August of 480BCE there is an epigraph at Thermopylae.  Translated into English, it reads thus:
GO TELL THE SPARTANS, STRANGER PASSING BY
THAT HERE OBEDIENT TO THEIR LAWS WE LIE.",1087862400,27,2875,4.6779324055666
1852573,3,B00008MTWI,"Of course, that is because I was a very young child when this movie was originally being played.  It's still fun to watch.

It's main redeeming quality...it's a good clean movie that is biased toward the admirable qualities in mankind...duty, honor, country.  This is something that you don't get to see very often from Hollywood these days.

I waited a very long time for this to come out on DVD, and bought it immediately.  It will forever be part of my collection, and I will watch it many more times over the years.

1852575,4,B00008MTWI,"The only reason I have not heaped more stars on this 1961 classic is the lack of extra's on the DVD, although the Widescreen reproduction is good, the picture and sound crisp, and overall a great package. Recently referred to in ""The Last Samurai"" whilst drawing parallels of futile ""last stands"", this movie is beginning to attract a new audience, as well as enthrall those who remember it the first time around. With the renewed interest in the genre (Troy / Alexander the Great) at theaters now, and in post production respectively, this is a timely release. Another plus is that this movie is seldom seen on countless reruns on TV like so many, and is a worthy addition to any fans collection. In a similar way to Troy, there is an air of inevitability to the story which heads for the ill fated battle at Thermopylae. Some policital bungling and bad planning pits Richard Egan and his elite but small army against the ravages of Xerxes (he who commanded an army of 1,000,000)at the aforementioned pass, and the end result though predictable is stirring. Some interesting metaphors abound (as was the practice at that time) comparing the political problems of 1961 to the historical aspects of the movie, but otherwise this is a solid picture. The battle sequences are a bit tame by todays standards, but there is a wonderful dramatic quality to the direction and script, often missing in todays CGI festooned reproductions.

1852576,4,B00008MTWI,"This was one of the last of the great sword-and-sandal epics. Unlike many before it or since, it managed to get the facts generally correct. The story, recorded in Herodotus, concerns a small band of troops from Sparta who held off the advance of the Persian army in the 5th century B.C. In doing so, they gave their fellow Greeks time to organise a larger army. Themes include: democracy vs. despotism, and sacrifice for the sake of the common good. Ever stoic Richard Egan (star of
""Pollyanna,"" ""Esther and the King,"" and other fun films) does a great job of projecting the inner strength of Spartan leader Leonidas. This film is not to be missed and ranks with other memorable epics of the 1960s, such as ""The Long Ships"". Note: this is newly remastered and should not be confused with the botched version released some months prior.",1085011200,4,836,4.6938775510204085
1852587,3,B00008MTWI,"I had not seen ""The 300 Spartans"" since it was first released theatrically in 1962. I seem to recall it was also called ""The Lion of Sparta"". Being a fan of these ""spear and sandal "" epics that were so popular at the time, I am very pleased to see titles like this being issued on DVD.
At the same time, ""Spartans"" is not a great film, although it is certainly colourful and entertaining.
Of course it tells the story of one of the most famous battles of the ancient world--Thermopylae--where King Leonidas of Sparta, and his personal guard of 300 men, held off--at least for a time--the countless hordes of Xerxes of Persia, who was determined to atone for his father, Darius' failure to conquer Greece 10 years earlier. Since they were entrenched in a narrow pass, Leonidas and his men were successful in frustrating Xerxes, until a traitor showed the Persians a secret path around the pass, whereby they could surround and destroy the valiant Spartans. This sacrifice bought the Greek army and navy precious time to unite and ultimately defeat Xerxes.
This film lacks the grandeur ( and budget ? ) of some of the other historical spectacles of the time like Ben Hur and El Cid. It also does not have the cheesy, but enjoyable camp aspects of the Italian ""epics"" of the day, with Steve Reeves and all those Reeves ""wannabes"". Richard Egan is Leonidas--while he is not Charlton Heston or Kirk Douglas, he does a credible job of expressing dignity and courage in the face of overwhelming odds. Sir Ralph Richardson is the wily Athenian politician, Themistocles--his voice alone commands your attention. Veteran British actor, David Farrar, chews up the scenery as Xerxes, bellowing orders, threatening fates-worse-than-death and--like any other despot in these types of films--ogling the dancing girls ! As his Commander-in-Chief, Donald Houston looks not at all comfortable in Persian warrior garb, taking constant flak from his increasingly impatient boss ! There is a weak romantic sub-plot that, frankly, gets in the way. The young lovers are played by Diane Baker and Barry Coe--Ms. Baker is fine--as for Mr. Coe, you can see why ""superstardom"" was not in his future !
The battle scenes are well-staged, although younger viewers--used to the digital wizardry in current movies--may find them quaint.
I see that another viewer has covered the technical aspects of the DVD better than I ever could--I will just say that I found the colourful, wide-screen picture to be excellent for a 40-year old film. Extras are sparse--a couple of trailers, TV promos, and trailers for three other Fox historical films.
Is it a coincidence that this DVD is being released at the same time as that new spectacle about ancient Greece, ""Troy"" ? I doubt it--but this is good news. While I could not give it 5 stars, ""The 300 Spartans"" and similar movies of its vintage, deserve to be resurrected, cleaned up and made available on DVD. The price is also attractive. Parents--there is nothing in this film that is inappropriate for children, and if it kindles their interest in history, that really is an ""extra"" !",1084924800,12,3097,4.878557874762809

1852589,3,B00008MTWI,"Many of us grew up on these Hollywood 'epics' of ancient history.  We remember them fondly.  ""The 300 Spartans"" is one such film.  Our memories, however, can play tricks on us.  Then we see them again as we age, and our opinions change.  We have to remember the times in which they were made and the type of audience that eagerly went to see them.
As a widescreen epic (and you have to see it in the 2:35x1 aspect ratio which the DVD presents), it stills holds some strange fascination.
Sir Ralph Richardson is the one stand-out performance; somehow, British actors seem to be able to deliver stilted dialog in such a way that it seems somehow classical.  Richard Egan was also a good actor.  As the Spartan king, his performance is consistant and even believable.  He is rugged-looking and seems to understand what his character is all about.  He brings the character on the page to some sembelence of life.
The rest of the cast make their characters seem cut from a comic book, or a very bad high-school production.  This is especially true of David Farrar as the Persian King, who tears up the screen without once delving beneath the skin to give his role any dimension.  These are supposedly professional actors, able to rise above a bad script.  Unfortunately, the director accepted only fair performances and let it go at that.
Barry Coe and Diane Baker have the unfortunate roles of the young lovers.  They were both young contract players at Fox and neither convinced anyone that they were either Spartans or that they were ever actually in love. Mr. Coe has one unfornutate line: ""Have you heard anything about the Persians?""  He delivers this like a football player asking his coach about the opposing team.
The script does present the story's history with fair accuracy.  Once the Spartans get on the march, the pace picks up nicely, and the battle scenes are well staged.  As usually happened with these epics, the production values of the behind-the-camera talent clearly outshone those being photographed.",1084320000,4,2019,4.791907514450867

It's almost like Ralph Richardson is acting in another movie. His Themosticles is eloquent and truely moving. But his scenes with Richard Egan are almost painful to watch ...
As for the rest ... well, this is a movie I saw when I was like 13 years old and it was perfect for me then. Now? I look back with affection, despite its flaws. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's still a wonderful film. I'm very happy to get the widescreen edition at last on DVD (allowing me to retire the old PS version I taped off TV).
For a slightly more sophisticated look at the battle of Thermopalye, let me recommend Stephen Pressfield's novel ""Gates of Fire."" It's available in paperback and is a first-rate fictional re-telling of the stand of the 300 Spartans.",1084320000,16,877,4.4875

I first saw this film as a young boy (I'm now 46), and it sparked an interest in ancient history that remains with me to this day. It would be interesting if someone saw fit to remake the film, with modern visual effects enhancements-but I wonder if it would have the same impact as the original.
Much of the movie is very close to the actual events, which took place in 480 B.C.  A huge Persian army, led by the Great King Xerxes, had crossed the Hellespont from Asia to conquer the impudent Hellenes.  The disparate, quarreling city-states of Greece had banded together to repel the invader, but could not agree on just what strategy to take.  It was decided that a force of Spartans and Allied Greeks would undertake a holding action at what was then a narrow pass between the mountains and the sea.  It was known as 'Thermopylae', or 'Hot Gates'.  The firmly religious Spartans were unable to send their full contingent of soldiers due to a holy festival (they were curiously tardy throughout their history in such situations).  However, Spartan King Leonidas' 300-strong personal bodyguard was not subject to this restriction, so he marched with them to the pass.  Along the way, he was joined by an estimated 7,000 or so Allied Greeks.  This tiny force went to confront a Persian host estimated by modern historians at around 100,000.
The battle itself is the stuff of legend.  Superior weaponry, armor, and tactics (the famed Greek Hoplite phalanx), combined with the narrow pass that favored defense, enabled the Greeks to repel several frontal Persian assaults with tremendous loss.  It appeared that the Greeks would be able to hold Thermopylae for a considerable time-until a traitor showed the Persians a goat path through the adjoining mountains which they could use to turn the Greek position.  Once this was accomplished, the Greeks were doomed.  Leonidas sent most of the Allied contingent to safety, and made plans for his last stand.  He along with his entire bodyguard and about 1,700 allied Greek troops were slaughtered to the last man.  Even though the Battle of Thermopylae was a Greek defeat, it punctured the myth of Persian invincibility, and served as a powerful inspiration in the future defense of Greece.  A  simultaneous naval engagement at nearby Artemisium produced similar results: the  Persian fleet suffered serious loss due to storm damage and effective Greek action.
Eventually, the Greek navy all but destroyed the Persian fleet near the island of Salamis (near Athens).  In 479, an Allied Greek army annihilated the last remnants of the vast Persian land host at Plataea (the greater proportion having crossed back to Asia with Xerxes after the loss of their supporting navy at Salamis), forcing the enemy from Europe for good.
The film adheres pretty closely to this narrative-with some 'Hollywood'.  The love story is pure fiction (surprised?); there is some evidence that a Greek contingent may have attacked the Persian camp (possibly an attempt at killing Xerxes, thus circumventing the whole Persian expedition).  The Greek army was larger than portrayed in the film-but I'm sure this was due to budgetary constraints.  Mardonius, Hydarnes, and the Immortals-10,000 strong-really did exist (Mardonius commanded the Persian forces at the battle of Plataea, and was killed there).  Themistocles (played in the film by Ralph Richardson) was the driving force behind the creation of the Athenian navy-and commanded the Greek fleet in the crucial action at Salamis.  Unfortunately, the major role he played in the victory over Persia is largely absent in this film.
The actual Sparta was a far cry from the liberal land portrayed in the film; weak or sickly Spartan children were thrown from a cliff at birth, or left to die from exposure.  Sparta was a harsh oligarchy, a military society where males were trained to be soldiers from birth.  The entire population of Messenia, a nearby city-state, was enslaved so the Spartans could devote their all to military training.  Sparta greatly feared a revolt of these 'helots', and many historians quote this as a main reason the whole of the Spartan army was reluctant to leave the homeland when their assistance was requested.
In spite of these inaccuracies, this is indeed a great film to watch-and no one can dispute just what the stand of Leonidas and his 300 mean to democracy in the modern world.  See it-you won't be disappointed.",1074556800,189,4482,4.995962314939435
1852596,4,B00008MTWI,"I write a DVD column for the Desert Post Weekly (Palm Springs).  A number of readers asked about the insert in current DVDs from Fox Home Video that announced 300 SPARTANS as a ""New on DVD"" release.  Here's what Shari Rosenblum at Fox had to say:

""The 300 Spartans is being released by Fox Home Entertainment in the future, but we have not made an official announcement regarding a street date.  It will likely come out as part of a Father's Day promotion this year, but again, we have no official release date to confirm at this time.""

Update: the DVD has been released and it is a fine looking transfer of a solid, heroic story done on a limited budget.",1073347200,6,657,4.396694214876033
