This blu-ray is an official release. This is not a bootleg.

The blu-ray comes with Japanese language and English/Chinese subtitles. The English subtitles had a couple of typos, but nothing that ruined the overall production. My Japanese is limited, so I wasn't able to tell if the translation was accurate. It appeared to do well.

For the story...

It goes off the rails. Any connection to the original series is discarded in this film. Evangelion:3.33 is one of those movies that I'll need to watch a handful of times over before being able to place a solid score on.

It is, however, gorgeous. The image quality afforded by blu-ray and a high definition television brings you an experience never before seen in the series with a fluidity of animation and a marriage of CGI so perfect I feel this sets the bar for everything after it.",1425945600,,912,4.675
8667801,5,B00LRTA6V6,"This is the official HK release of Eva 3.33. It indeed comes with English and Mandarin subs, Region locking should not be an issue since this is a Blu-ray. Your Blu-ray player should automatically set the language for the menus based on your Blu-ray players region. Simply pop in the disc and you should be good to go.",1413504000,2,318,4.5
