7867384,4,6304304277,"At at time when the only source of Brit-coms was the local PBS, this show was a staple.  In fact, I think it's probably still being broadcast at times.  While not quite the golden age of the show, these three episodes have all the things that made it seems terribly superior to many of the lower tier US comedies.

For instance there is sexual inuendo.  Not terribly sophicated but Mrs. Slocombe's pussy makes many a double entendre.  While not Out and Proud, John Inman's campy Mr. Humphries is always good for a chortle.

There's probably very little there that the average pre-teen won't get but it's actually pretty harmless compared to a lot of stuff that has made its way to television over the years.",1191628800,,707,4.616
7867385,5,6304304277,"Once again we have a set of three episodes from this delightful British comedy, and this time the common ground is that, while the series is as always ensemble comedy, each episode focuses on one member of the Grace Brothers staff.
In the first episode, it is Mrs. Slocombe's birthday and while she makes sure everyone knows it, she doesn't bargain on their figuring out how old she is.
In the second one, Captain Peacock, the very epitome of propriety even if he quite notices any exposed cleavage, is suspected of carrying on with Mr. Rumbold's secretary.  By the time Mrs. Peacock appears, and the good Captain is put on trial by his fellow employees, you'll be laughing, you won't be able to help it. That is, assuming you do have a sense of humor.
And then, in the third episode, mild mannered Mr. Grainger is put in charge and becomes a tyrant.  Of course, he does get his come-uppance and all ends well and hilariously.
I'll warn you now, this series can be addictive.",1024531200,3,975,4.565714285714286
