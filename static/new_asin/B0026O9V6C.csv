The instructor was very robotic and barely smiled (in face the only time I ever saw her smile was while spinning fire, but never in the actual instruction).  This didn't help me do anything more than I had already figured out on my own.  No choreography, barely any real transitions.  Will be selling this on CraigsList immediately.",1299542400,2,425,4.626666666666667
