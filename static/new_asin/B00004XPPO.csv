1367700,4,B00004XPPO,"Listen up Kicking and Screaming(and Mr. Jealousy) fans! Noah Baumbach has not let us down yet, and this film is no exception. it has all of his  trademark dialogue and characters. It also has a lot of his cast  regulars-Eric Stoltz, Chris Eigeman, Carlos Jacott. Annabella Sciorra  returns and so does Dean Cameron(yes! ). It also has 80s goddesses Justine  Bateman, Rae Dawn Chong and Ally Sheedy! Plus Peter Bogdanovich(who was  pretty good in Mr. Jealousy)! This film did not get much of a theatrical  release, but thank god it's finally available to be ordered on dvd! Noah  Baumbach is really a can't miss type writer-director for those of us who  like his films-just order it!",969148800,4,682,4.818965517241379
1367721,4,B00004XPPO,"If possible, view this on DVD - you'll want to cue up several different scenes.  Yes. The lighting is poor, the acting is hurried, the set is something from an old high school musical (probably from Western NY). It was filmed in a week - don't kill the messenger. Nonetheless, if it's 1 am, and you can't sleep - THIS is the movie to watch.  Don't expect 'Caddyshack', or 'Old School'- some parts ARE hysterical, but its humor is subtle (particularly the mannerisms of certain characters, plot holes that aren't explained, etc) - which is precisely why one can view it over and over again.

NOTE:  If for no other reason - you must see this film, for the scene of the two giant lizards conversing over work at the Halloween party.  Never on celluloid has the ""F"" word been so prefectly placed.",1091836800,6,793,4.5174825174825175
1367722,2,B00004XPPO,"Perhaps predictably, this movie suffers from not having the same kind of time and money invested in its production compared to Kicking & Screaming and Mr. Jealousy.  Those two films had a uniquely beautiful combination of literate dialogue and humorous ensemble interaction.  While Highball had many of the same actors from the first two movies, the overall dialogue and themes were totally different.  The first two movies had irreverence mixed with the sympathy of nostalgia and the difficult emotional transition to adulthood.  Highball had no direction at all.
While I no longer remember all the details of Highball, I felt that the characters were poorly defined and the plot less meaningful than Mr. Jealousy and Kicking & Screaming.  The movie seemed incomplete and hastily put together.
If you like literate, witty ensemble comedies, you should definitely see Kicking and Screaming, then Mr. Jealousy, then the Whit Stillman trilogy (which also features Chris Eigeman):  Metropolitan, Barcelona, and The Last Days of Disco.  All 5 of those being among my favorites.",1041724800,6,1073,5.313609467455621
1367723,4,B00004XPPO,"Interesting comedy told through the course of three parties in one apartment:  a birthday party, a Halloween party, and a New Year's Eve party.  Basically centered around the couple who's apartment it is who first are together (birthday), break-up (Halloween), and then are married (New Year's) and all their weird and strange friends they join together for each occasion.  For anyone who can remember times like these or are going through times like these, there are plenty of moments to laugh at.  Like the boring awkward birthday party magician?!  Or the hideously costumed drunk hostess at Halloween?!  Or a friend coming out on New Years Eve?!  It's all there.....strangely and sadly so.  You will recognize so man actors in this I don't know how the director got them all for this nothing of a movie but he did, from Stolz to Sheedy to Bogdanovich and more.  You'll have fun guessing who's who, but there's plenty of who's not in the film too.  Quirky, strange, but enjoyable.",1030665600,3,982,4.86144578313253
1367724,4,B00004XPPO,"What's up homebrew?
Hilarious dialogue! ""..Everybody Felix!...""
It's a movie of conversations and very little action.. It's hilarious. I can't describe it.. Everyone is just so goofy! It's subtle....FELIX steals the show...And as a fan of Galaxie 500 and Luna, It is cool to see Dean Wareham in a movie and doing the music for it.. He does a cool version of ""Frankie And Johnny"". It's a real low-budget film shot in just 6 days! I don't know about the DVD, I only have the VHS version but it's a good movie for the people with a weird sense of humor! ""How did my birthday boy spend his birthday?"".... ""NOTHING."" this is for the people who like irreverent comedies. Support indie films. It's goofy, it's New York, it's indie, it's Rae Dawn Chong, Ally Sheedy, Justine Batemen and more! Same apartment...3 parties.. a birthday party, a halloween party and a New Year's party.

1367725,5,B00004XPPO,"It came upon accident i even saw this ridiculously funny movie. The editing sucks, the plot goes absolutely nowhere, but the undertones of great humor fullfill this movie even through the closing credits. If one is looking for a movie with flat out jokes please don't waste your time. To those with a sense of humor, on the other hand, this is one of my all time favorite movies. I've recommended this movie to most of my friends and have never had a negative comment. I have since purchased Mr. Jealousy and Kicking and Screaming by the same director, Noah Baumbach, god lets hope they are remotely compared to this outstanding work of art.",999561600,2,641,4.631578947368421
1367726,5,B00004XPPO,A friend of mine recommended this movie to me so I picked it up. The first time I watched it I laughed so hard I fell of my bed. It is all subtle humor so if you like that kind of movie just buy this.,997747200,,200,3.466666666666667
1367727,4,B00004XPPO,"If you're a fan of subtle humor, definitely see this movie. The plot is pretty basic, its about a newlywed couple and the parties they though, the the dialouge makes the film.
The reason why the film isn't worth $60.00 is because the lighting and the editing are on a student film level.  The movie was made on a VERY low budget, and it shows.  But the script makes the viewer forgive the look of the film.
To be fair, let me make it VERY clear that the director is a pro, and if you watch his previous films you see that he makes great looking films.
Unfortunatly, he had a very small budget for this  film.
If you're into suble humor, dialouge films, or if you have a offbeat taste for film, don't miss out on Highball!!",995241600,3,722,4.217391304347826
1367728,1,B00004XPPO,"I'm a big Baumbach fan so I thought I'd grab this DVD to put in my collection. Unfortunately it's almost too horrible to watch because of the video transfter quality. The VHS copy isn't like that, I rented it from BB just to see. Anyway, I wouldn't suggest buying this DVD unless you want a horrible ...  peice of work.",994291200,,319,4.316666666666666
1367729,3,B00004XPPO,"I'm a big NB fan.  THis movie, with it's awful edits, still manages to be entertaining.  It isn't nearly as good as his other two films, but still kept me glued to the TV for 75 minutes.  The guest shots are fantastic, particularly the Ally Sheedy ones.  Christopher Eigeman, my favorite actor, deserved a better part, but Carlos Jacott is terrific.  Baumbach himself gives an enjoyable performance.  THe movie is all about dialogue and much of it is inspired.  If you are new to Noah Baumbach's work, go get Kicking and Screamin and then Mr. Jealousy.  This film is really best for fans, and curious viewers.  I'm awaiting Noah's next film with great hopes.",977097600,4,658,4.701754385964913
1367730,5,B00004XPPO,"Noah Baumbach....is brilliant. I have to start off by saying that if you've seen Highball...hopefully you looked past the sloppy editing. I'm sure that's why NB, Carlos and Chris took their names off of the project...but this movie is hilarious. It's quite possibly better than Mr. Jealousy, but of course doesn't hold a candle to K&S. The humor is so fast paced that you have to watch this movie a few times to catch all the jokes, as is the way with all of NB's movies. There is rarely a dull moment and NB gets to show us that he's also a brilliant actor as well as a writer/director. Although Eigeman didn't appear a whole lot...he still got the job done. Carlos was absolutely perfect in a role turned 180 degrees in the likes of Otis...or Vince even. Can you name me five of the best movies of all time?! DING! Ummm...K&S...Mr. Jealously...Highball...Um....Days of Wine and Monkeys...John Grisham's The Monkey...",973036800,6,918,4.74375
7926089,3,B00004XPPO,"Highball (1997) is nothing short of a mediocre indie film about a group of oddball friends who meet first at a birthday party, later during Halloween mascaraed, and finally at a New Year's Eve party.  The three parties are held at one couple's apartment in Brooklyn, who happen to have a lazy Hispanic doorman (actually the funniest part of the film).  All these friends have their own problems, which create quirky situations.  I would rather recommend seeing films that are similar in nature but much entertaining, namely: Swingers (1996), Sidewalks of New York (2001), The Rules of Attraction (2002), or The Good Guy (2009)...or any of the Woody Allen films.

While watching the movie I could not help but notice the striking resemblance between the Canadian actor playing Travis (Christopher Reed) and American actor Zach Galligan from Gremlins (1984)-- I actually thought that it was Zach Galligan playing Travis...to make it even more interesting, Robert Lewandowski from the 2015 Bundesliga season looks just like Christopher Reed in the film Highball...the facial features and hair are nearly identical.  Is it possible? Could Reed be Lewandowski's real father? :)",1443830400,,1172,5.245989304812834

7926093,1,B00004XPPO,"When I see ""All Star Cast"" mentioned in a movie description I think of names like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta- NOT Justine Bateman or Ally Sheedy or (pause to roll eyes) Rae Dawn Chong. But hey, a little hype to pique interest in an obscure movie doesn't mean it's a festering stinkpile, right? Right? But since the mailbox was further away than my TV, I decided to give it a try before walking all the way outside to angrily mail it back to Blockbuster with a terse note to cancel my subscription. Anyway, I really should start listening to my instincts. Thirty minutes later, after becoming criminally insane with boredom, I snatched this meandering yawn-fest from my DVD player. The story... Well, there is none really. The whole thing is little more than a series of parties in which a group of friends meet and engage in ""witty"", ""clever"" and often snarky dialogue. It's a character sketch kind of movie but the problem is, the characters are pretty lame, including Ally Sheedy who plays HERSELF, and the ""clever dialogue"" appears to have been written by drunks or film school dropouts. Or, as is more likely, drunk film school dropouts. It's the kind of artsy pseudo-intellectual dreck that people like to pretend is profound and funny but critical thinking skills will tell you it's rubbish. Couple this with the movie's production cost of around $99.00 and the shooting schedule of a couple of afternoons in poorly-lit houses and editing done by the same drunken dropouts who wrote it and tadaahhh- FESTERING STINKPILE! Get this movie only if you either want to waste 90 minutes of your life and hate yourself for doing it or be a part of the clique of twenty or so people worldwide who think Noah Baumbach is a brilliant filmmaker. Trust me- neither is worth the agony.",1327622400,,1802,4.723809523809524
7926094,5,B00004XPPO,"This is a must for collectors of Noah Baumbach's work or just great dialog and quirky character studies. The editing is pretty bad at times, so bad that he used a fake name as the director, but still a must see for fans. I am a dvd collector so I had to get it. Its hard to find so if they are selling cheap I would pick it up.",1269820800,,327,3.753623188405797
7926095,4,B00004XPPO,"This film was shot in only six days--and it looks it.  The one set of a couple's apartment is not very attractive to look at, but who cares.  It suits the needs of the film.  What I like about the quirky ""Highball"" is the weird comic writing and some inspired performances.  The movie was written and directed by Noah Baumbach, whom you may know as the writer/director of ""The Squid and the Whale"" and more recently, ""Margot at the Wedding"".  ""Highball"" is from 1997, and Mr. Baumbach chose to put two different aliases on the film as the writer and the director.  Hopefully he's not ashamed of this early flick of his because it's quite enjoyable.

The story is simple.  Young couple throw three parties over the course of a year.  First is a birthday party for a very odd friend.  The second is a hoot of a Halloween party (the funniest sequence).  And last is a New Year's Eve party.  Their friends come over and people fight and kiss and play games and eat.  And that's about it.

The cast is very diverse: Justine Bateman (who is excellent as a wallflower who later blossoms), director Peter Bogdanovich (who is delightful as he quotes from various movies), Ally Sheedy and Rae Dawn Chong (who both play themselves), Eric Stoltz, Annabella Sciorra and Chris Eigeman.

If you're looking for something different and fun, check out ""Highball"". It's a kooky little gem of a flick.",1198713600,2,1381,4.625514403292181
7926096,5,B00004XPPO,This is the funniest movie I have ever seen I thought it was much better than Kicking and Screaming,1166486400,,99,4.2631578947368425
7926097,1,B00004XPPO,"Ignore the blurb on the VHS box, the movie is not about a couple's hot parties with hip friends, it is about a couple's awful parties with jerk friends. Now, that might not be a bad thing -- in fact, I think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones -- but the advertising is dishonest.

Much worse, though, is the the pointless and boring character of the movie, which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic ""friends"" who mostly don't like each other. While I've known cliques that keep getting together despite frictions between some members, it's inconceivable that these people would keep getting together for these abusive and tedious holiday events. Also, the couples' relationships, which come and go between these parties, are unexplained and mostly unexplored, as are some individuals' character changes, and indeed, almost everything that doesn't happen at the parties themselves.",1120608000,3,936,5.0
7926098,5,B00004XPPO,"This movie is gorgeous.  We consider ourselves connoisseurs of movies, and this is one of only a few that we own.  If you get subtle yet truly funny comedy, own this movie.",1103155200,,172,4.34375
