7953978,5,B00005TT70,Bobby Woods trains my son who is 6 years old.  He gave us this dvd to watch.  My son loves it!!  Bobby is a great guy and even better trainer/instructor.  This is a must buy if you have a child playing ball.  VERY HELPFUL,1391126400,,221,3.9318181818181817
7953979,5,B00005TT70,The cute cover belies the strong solid content of this video.  This was an excellent tutorial for both my 8 and 4 year old grandsons.,1372636800,,133,4.32
7953980,5,B00005TT70,"Lots of good information.

Presented in an interesting way.

Even kept the interest of a five year old.

I found it Help full.",1368144000,,126,4.391304347826087
7953981,5,B00005TT70,"I am a mom, but I have a lot of experience with batting technique. I have coached youth league baseball and have learned from one of the best batting instructors in town. Sometimes despite doing all the right things there's something missing in your swing that compromises power and control. My son was struggling and I was struggling to figure out how to help him despite my experience. This video looked intriguing, despite the cover and the reviews were positive. I'd like to add to them, by saying that this is a great video. If you find yourself coaching your child or volunteering in youth baseball, but all you have in your 'tool box' is what you learned as a kid, you need this video. If you find yourself telling anyone to raise their back elbow, you need this video. It has a corny little story line, but the information is good and the drills are great.",1286928000,,864,4.509554140127388
7953982,5,B00005TT70,"I watched this video together with my 8-year-old son, whose team I coach.  He got it right away and has improved his swing tremendously.",1283731200,,136,4.666666666666667
7953983,5,B00005TT70,"This is a great resource that has a slightly cheesy title that might keep some people from purchasing it. It teaches solid fundamentals and communicates them in a way that ""clicked"" with my 10-year-old son. My son didn't want to watch it at first because of the title and the picture of the ""little kid"" on the cover. Now he watches it frequently and retains what is taught. Use this video along with Dusty Baker's ""You Can Teach Hitting"", and you've got all you need to help a youngster learn to hit well.",1131494400,8,506,4.451612903225806
7953984,4,B00005TT70,"No, I can't claim to have viewed all of the many hitting videos that have flooded the market in recent years, but I've seen a bunch, and in my experience this is the best one out there for very young ball players.  There is actually an attempt to create a ""story line"" here involving a 12-year-old, a single mom, and an ex-ballplayer who happens by fortuitiously one sunny day in Central Park.  The rest of the video involves instruction and drills.  The key here, however, is that the approach taken by Bobby Woods (the ex-ballplayer) and his instructions/advice are really excellent, well-chosen, and to the point.
I've been involved with very young hitters for a few years now as a Little League ""assistant dad,"" and although I certainly know a good batter's swing from a poor one, I know how hard it is to actually diagnose and then put into words the problems and solutions associated with kids' batting technique.  This video does a fine job of pointing out the most common problems that young hitters actually exhibit, and of offering advice and drills that will help to overcome these problems.
The truth is that there is no ""quick fix"" that will instantly turn a struggling hitter into a game-winner.  Kids have different levels of coordination and overall physical ability. But there is nothing like good technique in conjunction with ""repetition, repetition, repetition"" to build the muscle memory (a concept discussed in the video) necessary to becoming a first-rate baseball player, so people who purchase this fine video should realize that a child must do more than simply watch the presentation to improve his/her hitting.  He or she must do at least some of the drills repeatedly, must practice (and WANT to practice), and must be willing to accept slow, steady progress toward the goal of maximizing his or her abilities. Associated with this, either the child's coach, a parent, or another interested adult must be willing to actively help the child improve his or her batting ability--the child can't do it alone.
As with all of these instructional videos, the presentation could have been a bit more polished.  Bobby Woods' narration and instructions are very good, but he adds a few too many ingratiating references to the instructee as ""Pal,"" etc. for my taste.  A small matter.",1020384000,13,2301,4.912371134020619
7953985,5,B00005TT70,"Bobby Woods explains the hitting techniques and drills so that even a NON-ATHLETIC mom like me can understand what it's all about. Since watching the video and trying out the drills, my daughter moved right to the top in batting stats on her high school varsity softball team last season. I can't wait for softball season to get here this year!",1009324800,8,344,4.655737704918033
