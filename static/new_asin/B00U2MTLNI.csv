8704004,5,B00U2MTLNI,"Excellent staging and Dancing.  This is a lovely and heartfelt performance.  Although often criticized, the plot is no more inconceivable than La Sylphide, Giselle, Swan Lake or practically any other great classic. There are lovely variations and dancing.  The sets and costumes are wonderful and atmospheric.  The music is upbeat and fun.  Some critic said it's time to retire this old warhorse.  Nonsense - unless you think it's time to retire Giselle and Les Sylphides and all the other lovely ballets that challenge reality as well.  It's ballet history and brings enjoyment and happiness.  I will take those things any day.",1476403200,2,628,5.148514851485149

8704007,3,B00U2MTLNI,"Cocajuru is a wonderful ballerina, and she is splendidly partnered here, but this warhorse needs to be put out to pasture.  For one thing, the spectacle of a fat old guy in a turban falling all over himself in pursuit of a young beauty is really distasteful.  The fallings-out and fallings-in of bunches of young guys with swords isn't very interesting either.  The famous pas de trois (usually for some reason called a pas de deux) is
the high point; most of the rest belongs on the cutting-room floor.",1440374400,2,503,4.629213483146067
8704008,1,B00U2MTLNI,"Videography is aweful.  I can see every pixel on the screen, therefore jumpy action.  The angle of the camera is so high up it makes all dancers look short legged with heavy upper body, extremely difficult to watch let alone enjoy.  The English National Ballet should never release such low quality recording.  It is not doing any good for not only its dancers but itself.  I am throwing this DVD away.  I cannot watch jumpy action due to video quality and short legged dancers. It's a shame because the 2 main dancers are exceptional live.",1439596800,8,540,4.631578947368421
8704009,3,B00U2MTLNI,"This is billed as based on Sergeyev's Le Corsaire, but I feel it is a whole different version. To me it is very different from the Sergeyev version that the Mariinsky dances. I found it all right, but I like the style of the Mariinsky dancers better.",1436227200,,250,4.340425531914893
8704010,5,B00U2MTLNI,"Le Corsaire(The Pirate) is one of Petipa's great ballets, much beloved by balletomanes. It is basically a romantic comedy about a pirate who falls in love with a slave girl and tries to secure her freedom so they can be together. It is more lighthearted than some of the more common Petipa ballets but with plenty of serious moments. There is plenty of great dance sequences showing off dazzling choreography with much bravura. This traditional version is topnotch with all the great scenery and costumes this ballet deserves. The dancing is marvelous as is the music. There are no special features other than a cast gallery, but the enclosed booklet is informative with both a synopsis and interview. This is a great contribution to ballet discography.
By the way, just this little bit of trivia to show I was paying close attention: In the closing credits, it mentions the ballet shoes were provided by ""Feed of London"". It should of course, be ""Freed of London"".",1431043200,12,965,4.8545454545454545
