1064062,5,630567681X,"Reading the other reviews here, I felt compelled to submit my own. Clockwatchers is one of my favorite movies of 1998, perfectly capturing the aimlessness and degradation of being a temporary worker.  I can't figure  out the current trend of completely inaccurate movie synopses on video  boxes (Muriel's Wedding, another Toni Collette favorite, is definitely not  the madcap adventure the box would have you believe)... True, there are  some truly great comic elements here, but THIS MOVIE IS NOT A COMEDY.  i  guess some of the other people expected a laff riot--this is definitely not  it.  Toni Collete's understated performance as sweet-but-shy iris is  perfect.  Parker Posey is hilarious as usual, playing the bitchy temp  veteran.  This movie is subtle, complex, well-developed, there is tons of  foreshadowing and symbolism, the muzak-y score is perfect... again, this is  definitely not a comedy, but it is one of the best and most thoughtful  movies I've seen in some time.",927504000,21,984,5.171974522292993
1064063,5,630567681X,"Anyone who has ever worked as an office temp can identify with the feelings of uselessness and frustration that is protrayed by all 4 of the main characters in this film. Each girl wants to make their mark on this  little corner of corporate America; but they meet with constant obstacles.  The ultimate goal is to become a permanant employee of the Dilbert-esque  company. The corporation is so boring that the only way to describe it is  ""beige."" However, when a complete outsider is hired, strange  things start to happen at work. The silent permanent employee is perfectly  cast in her role. She never utters a word; yet she speaks volumes. Imagine  a meek little church mouse in pitifully thick Coke-bottle glasses who is  assigned to be the personal secretary of the President of the company. She  squares-off with Toni Collette (who is wonderful, as always) and the sparks  fly despite her lack of words. This video is great for anyone in the mood  to completely concentrate on a film. It was my favorite Independent Film of  1998.",915753600,2,1038,4.769662921348314

1064163,5,630567681X,I read the 1 star reviews and they are so wrong. This is a great movie. It shows just how bad temps get treated sometimes. I loved it. I was temp when I got hired at permated job and they didn't treat us so well. I am now a tempt again and those things still happen.

1064164,5,630567681X,"Parker Posey has seriously grown on me over the years.  What I like about her movies are the emotional extremes they tend to evoke in people.  Either you hate it or you think it's brilliant.  Surprisingly most people lean toward the latter.  'Clockwatchers' is a wonderful example of this dynamic.

I see many people comparing this movie to Office Space and I believe they are doing the review readers a disservice.  The only thing similar about the 2 movies is that they both take place in an office and they are both highly relatable to a certain segment of employees.  The similarity ends there.  They have both been considered dark comedies, but I don't see how either of them fit into that category.  There was very little about Office Space that was dark and very little about Clockwatchers that was funny.  With that said, I could relate to Clockwatchers on such a fundamental level that if it comes on cable, I can't resist watching it.  Why?  Because I get something new from it every single time I see it.

Most of the people who gave this movie a poor rating, were expecting a comedy.  If you want to laugh and drift off into mindless entertainment, don't watch this.  It was meant to evoke thought regarding work ambitions and behaviors and it succeeds brilliantly at doing that.  If you work in an office setting, you should be able to find yourself somewhere in this movie and you may not like what you see.  It's like entertainment counseling that forces you to look at yourself from the outside where it's much easier to see your flaws clearly.  Offices should make this movie mandatory viewing for all incoming employees from the janitor to the CEO, so that people can start off with an understanding of how their work behaviors affect others.",1261008000,2,1760,4.659090909090909
1064165,4,630567681X,"The Bottom Line:

Clockwatchers is not a perfect film but it manages to do everything just a little bit better than you might expect (e.g. developing its characters, accurately depicting its middle class milieu, engaging the audience in its storyline, etc.) and I walked away reasonably pleased; it's not a classic by any means and it doesn't approach the subtle brilliance of Office Space but if you've ever worked as a temp or like the actresses involved, you shouldn't hesitate to give it a rent.

1064166,5,630567681X,"This is an outstanding flick!  To my mind, a chick flick's version of Office Space!

Enjoy!",1170806400,3,91,4.625
1064167,5,630567681X,"Clockwatchers is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. An inspired film full of original ideas, this thought-provoking brilliant satire that makes clever social commentary about how a workplace environment dehumanizes the people who work in it. Underlying the dark humor in the film are some powerful truths about the world of work.

Clockwatchers follows the story four temporary workers Iris, a shy woman contemplating her future in the working world, Margaret a brilliant free spirit whose dynamic personality hides her vulnerabilities, Paula, an older woman running out of time to achieve her dreams of becoming an actress, and Jane, a woman biding time with a job until she gets married to her dream man. Global Credit's indifferent employees don't see them as people with dreams and futures; just butts to fill seats so the company looks busy. So the four bide their time doing mindless tasks in this brain-numbing environment complete with tortuous lite muzak, bright florescent lights and drab gray furniture. Because they're temps no one sees them. To get a semblance visibility from someone in the company the four act in passive aggressive manner at work: Paula constantly breaking the copier with paper clips; Margaret's destroying the desk to state she was there, Jane's constant personal calls and Iris writing in a journal. To cope with the isolation on the job, the four temps become friends and even hang out after work.

As the women start to grow closer, they change: Iris grows out of her shyness, Margaret starts to actualize her potential as a leader, Paula starts making her move on the copier guy and working towards her acting career, and Jane starts to see an identity outside of her future husband. Just when the women are starting to grow, the soul-crushing environment of Global Credit works to break their friendship and their spirits. Even though the company has temps, it hires Cleo, an assistant for the job Margaret wanted and even suggested to management. Ironically, when the temp clique ignores her she begins stealing office objects in the same passive aggressive way to get attention. Minor stuff like mugs and such. This brings the full-time office staff into an uproar. I just love the BS speech made by the CEO about being a ""family"". Truly hilarious! I love how in that scene the out-of touch executives are shown sitting at a conference table on one side of the room and the employees huddled together tightly next to the door. Just like real life.

The company blames the temps for the thefts and starts to treat them in a more dehumanizing way to ferret out the thief. The humiliating tactics used by management like cameras, to watch the temps ultimately breaks up the relationships of the women. Iris passively watches as Margaret is fired unjustly; Jane escapes through her marriage and Paula gets transferred. Once all her friends are forced out of their jobs Iris starts to stand up for herself. Making herself visible with make-up and a suit her father bought for her, she gets her journal back from Cleo, and then manipulates the managers in such a way so she can get a letter of recommendation for Margaret. At the end of the movie we see Iris make a final transformation into a complete human being. Following her father's advice she never lets go of the memories of her friends from the temp job as she begins her new permanent job at the food company. I believe that's where she went, and this is why she stopped working at Global credit. In addition to the suit her father got her, She wears a gold necklace like Jane, lipstick like Paula, hair like Margaret and a new personality of her own.

This movie on the surface looks like a story about temps and how they deal with the indifferent workplaces they're in however, it's has more layers than that. There's probably more to this movie than I'm writing about, each time I watch it I get something new from it.

Directors Jill Sprecher and writer Karen Sprecher create a perfectly crafted film that looks and feels like real life transpiring in every frame. Production values are top notch for a low budget film. I love the office set design; the drab gray furniture and monotonous Berber carpet contrasting against the white Formica desks and bright florescent lights create an environment that's downright apathetic. The mind destroying lite muzak only adds to the insanity. But what I love most of all are the little touches in the characters' costumes, like Iris wearing no dowdy clothes and makeup, Margaret wearing the same brown rubber sole shoes with every outfit, and Paula's character overdressing and wearing too much makeup just to look younger. I also love how some supporting characters wear the same outfits two and three times. These little touches make this film just that more realistic and distinguish the character's unique personalities.

The acting in this movie is just brilliant. Toni Collette gives an-Oscar level performance as Iris. The understated way she acts truly captures a shy person. You only know how she feels about what's going on at work by watching her subtle facial expressions. Parker Posey also gives an Oscar level performance as Margaret. Posey has such a strong presence that she steals all of the scenes she's in. Lisa Kudrow is in top form here as Paula. Alana Ubach is great as Jane the woman who does nothing, but kill time until the nuptials. Look For Jamie Kennedy in a standout role as the mailroom guy and Debra Jo Rupp as Barbara the evil boss who always goes by the rules regardless of the people who work for her and, David James Elliot as a tall handsome manager who doesn't see anyone under him.

Clockwatchers is a top ten Shawn James Five star Essential Video. If you have a job or are starting one, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE! Mark my words in another four or five years people will be calling this movie a classic. Don't procrastinate; You must buy this DVD for your collection NOW!",1154563200,9,5968,4.788349514563107

Toni collette gives a brilliant performance as a woman struggling to find her place amongst other women on the same path as her who are just 'waiting for something to happen' and in some cases it didn't happen. Parker Posey and Lisa Kudrow also give great performances in this lowkey comedy/coming of age/hilarious/you go girl films.

I never really cared much for Toni Collete or Lisa Kudrow but I do love Parker Posey.  As soon as I saw her first appear in the film I just knew this wasn't going to be any ordinary comedy.  All the actors in this film deliver flawless performances and the characters are just like most people you encounter in the workplace.  It's deliciously cynical and dark, making fun out of the most ordinary and mundane situations - but it has a very profound and thought-provoking message in the end that makes the film seem sad overall.

1064250,4,630567681X,"You might raise my rating by one; if you dislike them, lower it by one star.

Several temps work in a non-descript office.  They share the fate of the ignored, unappreciated temporary worker who is neither a member of the staff, nor an outsider.  Call them in-betweeners.

Toni Collette stars as the prototypical mousy temp.  Lisa Kudrow and Parker Posey are her co-workers.

There really isn't much of a plot, beyond the strange interactions between the female temps and the 'real' employees of the company.  Toni Collette plays Iris Chapman, who is hired after passing a typing test of sorts, using invoices she's not to mess up because they are 'expensive'.  She gets the job in spite of botching more than a few of the expensive forms, which she puts in her purse, then disposes of them in the company restroom.

The film is long on atmospherics, long, lazy shots of the impersonal office, complete with the madding muzak music constantly playing in the background.  I was expecting for one of these women to go berserk, but the meltdowns seemed to be mainly internal.

I'd recommend this movie for the thoughful moviegoer who can appreciate a slow, deliberate film that seeks to explain and explore the repressed and the timid in the workplace, and how they manage to (generally) maintain their sanity in an indifferent world.",1097366400,7,1331,4.845132743362832
1064251,4,630567681X,"Clockwatchers is a movie about four office temps who work at a dreary, mind numbing assignment. The temps are basically treated like the scum off the earth. They bond but then are sadly drawn apart.
If you have ever temped or even worked at a boring office job, you will probably laugh and nod your head at some of its humor. It captures the craziness better than some of the more recent office comedies like Office Space. It's not for everyone and is very unusual film. It's not a ""laugh out loud"" comedy. The characters are a sad set and the humor is subtle and may be go ""over the head"" for some non-temps. It is not pretty either. The set design is gray and depressing. Have heard some people call it boring. Temping is boring. In other words, it is a lot like like temping.

I am so glad someone made this movie. Can't believe it got made, but am glad. It is a story that needed to be told. As someone who used to temp, it brought back a lot of memories. I knew people like these characters. People who stayed in these jobs because they lacked the confidence or education to change jobs.
Being Hollywood, they exaggerate a bit, but get much of it right. Temping is one of the biggest scams the business world has ever created. I was disappointed that they did not explore in detail some of the other problems with temping, like the relationship between the temp and the agency. There is some satire there, trust me. As a temp, you basically forfeit basic worker's rights. Little or no benefits, no sick time, no ""wrongful"" termination, never knowing if you will even have a job tomorrow, doing all sorts of busy work to keep your job. I suggest that anyone who ""wants"" to temp see this film and run like hell.",1082851200,5,1714,4.389937106918239
1064252,5,630567681X,"As someone who has been both a ""perm"" and a ""temp,"" I find much in ""Clockwatchers"" to be completely truthful.  Where ""Office Space"" (a movie I also loved) offered a cathartic revenge fantasy, ""Clockwatchers"" dares to tell it like it is -- that dead-end jobs really have no way out or up -- even if it is dreary and depressing.
There is humor, but rather than the cartoonish humor of ""Office Space,"" ""Clockwatchers"" shows the ridiculous in little everyday workplace happenings: playing with the adjustment mechanisms on your chair, popping sheets of bubble wrap, or using Liquid Paper as nail polish.
The weird combination of emotions that these temps go through -- hopelessness and ambition, despair and frivolity, anger mixed with s**t-eating grins -- are extremely realistic and something that those in a similar work situation can probably easily relate to.  The performances are outstanding, especially Toni Collette and Parker Posey.
Highly recommended!",1042329600,17,958,5.254901960784314
1064253,5,630567681X,"I liked this film a lot.  Besides the fact that I like to support smaller, independent films (especially since this one features a lot of women in front of and behind the scenes), CLOCKWATCHERS is simply an entertaining show!  It has a smart tone, and is a close cousin to OFFICE SPACE (featuring that *other* FRIENDS star, Jennifer Aniston).
The story is engrossing and concerns a pack of temps.  Toni Collette plays Iris, who starts out as a timid, shy and introverted person.  Her encounters with the other girls changes her (especially with the outspoken and quirky character played by Parker Posey - she's great in this!). Toni Collette is very good here - and although she is an Academy Award nominated actress (THE SIXTH SENSE) it's funny how the director's use of a new shade of lipstick is filmatic shorthand for the character change Iris goes through!  Lisa Kudrow is not quite as ditzy as she usually is on FRIENDS.  It's nice to see her in a different mode.
There's not much more story than that.  If you've been a temp or work in an office environment you will appreciate this film.  The film's theme is about sleepwalking through life and making your mark.  Most of the girls cow to the corporate machine.  One of them scratches ""I was here"" on her desk - just to make her mark.
There's an interesting subplot about an office thief that gets tied into the movie's theme nicely.
Please rent or buy this film.  It's not SPIDERMAN, but it deserves your attention.  Again, it is a ""small-character-study"" sort of film.  But it is very well done, with excellent performances from its cast.",1036713600,8,1598,4.664285714285715
1064254,4,630567681X,"This film is bizarrely uneven. What seems like a reasonably straight-forward comedy (albeit a pretty subdued one) gradually gives way to a depressing portrait of displacement in the inhuman contemporary work force. However, while changing gears, the film never loses the audience. The more comedic beginning commits us to these characters. We like them, we like them together, and we like them together in the ridiculous and pointless do-nothing jobs they keep. So as they drift apart and as the work conditions become more and more dehumanizing, we empathize totally and feel a disappointment in the deterioration of this little community we'd really come to like. Furthermore, most of us have had friendships drift apart, and more specifically working relationships become estranged. ""Clockwatchers"" preys on this and as a result is one of the more effective downers I've seen.
Much of the early half of the film reminds most viewers of a more tame ""Office Space,"" for obvious reasons. But ""Clockwatchers"" distinguished itself well from this movie and others of its type. Actually, I think a far closer companion film would be the early portions of ""Fight Club"" (another film that dramatically shifts gears but keeps the audience in tow). Like ""Fight Club,"" ""Clockwatchers"" relies on cynical and ironic wit and moreso on extremely stylized sets, lighting, and camerawork. Another unusual aspect of this film is the unmistakable lack of anything resembling a romance plot whatsoever. How many girlfriend comedies - commercial or independent - can you think of that don't land boyfriends on the laps of at least one of the characters before the credits roll? ""Clockwatchers"" succeeds by these differences. Its a film like really no other, and it fascinates us and sticks in our memories as a result. I mean, ""Clockwatchers"" isn't saving lives or anything, and Bresson it ain't, but it is a film I keep going back to for its many (refreshingly) atypical handlings of a pretty well-tread concept.",1035936000,6,1994,5.157407407407407
1064255,5,630567681X,"This is a mostly overlooked and underrated portrayal of the world of office temps. The beauty of this film is that, rather than hitting us with obvious plot devices, it slowly builds an atmosphere of oppression and monotony. The nameless company that employs and exploits the temps slowly chips away at the dreams, hopes and self-esteem of the characters. They are caught in an anonymous, meaningless life where the silliest of rules are ruthlessly enforced by petty tyrants. What's refreshing about Clockwatchers is the way it exposes the alienation of modern corporate life without resorting to the usual movie cliches. There is no sex, violence or even law suits here. It is seemingly trivial events, like the theft of small personal objects, that builds tension. There is also humor, the kind that fans of Dilbert will appreciate, as when a fired worker objects, ""you can't fire me, you don't even know my name!""  There is an existentialist feeling to the film, most notably verbalized by Parker Posey (a great addition to any independent film), who says something like, ""I don't think anyone cares if I even exist."" Clockwatchers is, I think, more than a movie about office temps. It's a commentary on our whole bureaucratic, atomized society. Along with Safe, another of my favorite films of the last decade (I'll proably review that one soon), Clockwatchers is a truly significant film about the modern world.",1020556800,43,1416,5.025531914893617
1064256,5,630567681X,"As another movie might have brought to life the sounds, sights and smells of some exotic location, this one evokes the endless gray carpet, xerox fumes, and soft shuffling paper sounds of the office. If you've ever had a pointless, boring office job you hated, you'll find yourself saying ""yes, oh my god, that's exactly how it is"" over and over again.  From the dress code to the ticking wall clock, this movie succeeds in capturing the dreary office limbo that so many 20-something women (and not few 30-somethings) toil away in every day, waiting for the mysterious something better that is presumably lurking down the road.  Everything in their lives is temporary, superficial, without substance - even friendship.
There's not much of a plot, it's 'slice of life' style - a single temp job, some minor office intrigue, a few happy hours, and a lot of clock watching.  In a category with Office Space and In the Company of Men, it's by far the darkest of the three, with a mordant wit that's more mordant than witty.  It wasn't hilarious or ""fun,"" like Office Space, or quite as edgy and downright evil as In the Company of Men, but it resonated more strongly with me than either one.  I give it a five because was such a brilliant, stingingly accurate statement about being 20-something, single, and female at the turn of the millenium.",1020556800,5,1340,4.7094017094017095

The characters are fully developed, having common bonds as well as lives outside of the office (complete with their own personal problems and hang-ups).
Also, the film works on more than one layer.  On the surface, it is a story about a shy girl working in an office and how it changes her.  But more than that, it is about how we view work and what we must endure to earn a living.  Most importantly, the film is has a lot to say about the concept of time and how we choose to spend it.

It was that good. People should not be fooled into thinking, however, that this is some laugh-out-loud comedy. There are laughs, but ""Clockwatchers"" is by and large a dark film. It covers a year in the life of four temp-secretaries who work at a soulless, drab stuck-in-the-1950s ad firm that looks like every schoolroom you grew up in (outstanding set design, down to the frosted ripple glass windows, washed-out pastel tones and antique pencil sharpeners)and is about as much fun to work at. The girls are all trying to escape to better lives and become friends, but as they grow increasingly desperate and humiliated, their friendship, rather than strengthening, begins to crumble. Toni Collette does a great job as Iris, the chief-young-woman-in-transition, trying to figure out who she is and where she is going in a world where she does not seem to matter, while Parker Posey, who rightfully has a cult following (and not just because she's cute, though as long as we're on the subject -- she is, very) is hilarious as the girl who wants a better life but isn't willing to work to get it. All four believe they are invisible and irrelevant, and they are largely proven right as the movie goes on. Their job is dehumanizing drudgery, and those who could mitigate it, by showing them respect and consideration, do the exact opposite. The woman who oversees the temps is every condescending schoolmarm you ever had in fourth grade. The executives are either shallow or vacuous, and talk without listening and smile without meaning it. Even the perfume girl in the department store, who should be an ally, chooses to hide behind snobbery. All the girls want to hear is ""I see you"" but people keep trampling them as if they don't exist. If all this sounds familiar to you, it may very well be -- ""Clockwatchers"" is a satire or sorts, but not so exaggerated that one can't relate to it from personal experience. It may not be a ""guy"" movie, but I'm a guy and I loved it anyway. By the way, did I mention I think Parker Posey is cute?",1012176000,7,2358,4.590047393364929

These few seconds of acting are among the most devastating I've seen in recent film. They are beautiful, and so is Parker Posey.  Every move she makes in this film gushes with brilliance.  And her acting is only one of the reasons that this film is a must see.  ""Clockwatchers"" is one of the twenty best films of the 90s.",988588800,5,515,4.389473684210526

Rent the hilarious movie Office Space.  As for Clockwatchers, there isn't a soul on Earth who could not relate to these four women, especially the fiesty character Margaret.  Jill Sprecher has done a good job at capturing the woes of trying to, at least, get noticed by your employers in a positive way.  I do believe that Clockwatchers went a bit over-the-top at times, and I grew tired of the self pity that these ladies kept putting themselves through.

Apparently, the editorial reviewer has led an advantaged life some place where the economy has always boomed, where everyone has always known what they wanted and gotten it, where business culture is democratic and kind.  Clockwatchers, for all its interesting European styling, has pinned down two  realities most realistically: life in a business office and what life is like when you are waiting for it to become something, anything. Toni Collette's performance is incredible as is that of the rest of the cast.  Their characters are recognizable but not stereotypes.  The comedy is gentle, the sound and settings are stark, but the sting of being so invisible you don't even rate the bottom of the totem pole is like a bright flare. I gave this only four stars because some might think it drags (but that is part of its point), and others will never appreciate the fact that yes, for many intelligent women, this is a passage of life.

She has come a long way from ""Muriels Wedding"" and has made quite a name for herself as a character actor.  Lisa Kudrow plays a great cynic.  Parker Posey holds her trademark dark spritely self and does a great scene where she gets fired.  All in all this movie presents a excellent interpretation of todays American office politics and how people in todays workforce are underpaid, underappreciated and are continually thrown to the way side.  This movie holds well and makes you feel right along with what is going on within the film.  I saw this movie on Starz just recently and I recommend seeing it for free first before buying this on DVD since this movie isn't all that great on DVD with the exception of wide screen format.

Although this isn't technically a comedy, anyone who works in an office would be rolling on the floor in recognition of the tedium that sitting behind a desk means. Parker Posey makes me smile anytime she is on the screen, and in this film, she is truly the engine that makes it run. The truly hysterical moment, when after receiving yet another senseless memo, where Posey rolls her chair out into the aisle ripping the memo to shreds and throwing it over her head is classic.

It proceeds slowly and dreamlike as these temps live  in a droning, lifeless hell. This corporation appears to have no reason for  living just as these ladies have no compelling function to fulfill at the  office. They're just there, doing silly chores and getting occassionally  micromanaged on a most minute process. Their disbelief gets further  challenged as the corporation takes ugly monitoring steps to reduce a rash  of thefts (stolen paperweights, pens and coffee mugs!). It's like a setting  from one of those Tom Stoppard plays of the absurd, but made palatable for  the movie audience.
Management is barely present at this corporation.  Usually, they're off to meetings, never answering their phones and never  minding the store, leaving these temps alone to ponder this strange  setting. When management appears they are portrayed disconnected  automatons, not the type of Machavellian Dogberts you might expect in an  office sendup movie.
Toni Collete is amazing. She can telegraph every  thought and nuance. She does not even need to speak for us to know what is  going on.",959558400,4,1253,5.226130653266332

I can relate to everything Iris (Colette) goes through in the film. When someone starts a job, it begins as  fun. Then, something comes along to turn it into just another job. That's  what makes Clockwatchers a spot on interpretation of our lives. The  performances are also great: Colette as the shy one; Kudrow as the man  wanting, actress; Posey as the fiesty, outspoken one; and Ubach as a  pampered, unknowing bride-to-be. I'm usually not a fan of independant  films, but once in a while, one comes along to grab my attention and never  let's go until the very end. This one did that. This movie also makes it's  point without using excessive language, violence, or sex. After the last  indy film I watched (Happiness), I needed a cleansing. This was a nice  change of pace. lately, people have been writing discouraging remarks about  this film. OK, then, why don't you rent some box office moneymaker for the  10,000th time?

1064535,4,630567681X,"""Clockwatchers"" is not just a comedy about bitter temps, in actuality, it's a satire about people's lives and how they can be totally crushed under the oppression of the work force. It's a film that exposes,  with no mercy, the tedious, soul-draining routine that workers, especially  temps, go through every day, and how they can feel totally trapped, with no  chance at freedom. Sure, it's wickedly funny in it's observations of  soulless companies and their rules and policies, but beneath it lies a  bleak look at how people can totally lose their identity when devoted to  their job, when everything always boils down to pleasing others and  maintaining a decent salary. Like Parker Posey's character says in one  scene, ""I feel like I'm floating, with no connection to the outside  world"". The actresses in ""Clockwatchers"" are great, they all  express their characters perfectly, especially during the second half of  the movie, when all of their friendships crumble. The transformation of  Toni Collette's character is chilling, especially at the end. The only  thing that bothered me were the last twenty minutes, they dragged on,  focusing on a plotline that didn't need to be explored.

7893606,2,630567681X,"Well, ordering this movie from Amazon.com in 2016 rather than face to face at a brick and mortar Blockbuster store that has since gone out of business is sort of like being cast as an extra in Clockwatchers back in the 1990's,
a dark comedy about not fitting in to regular normal brick and mortar society as a temporary worker compared to a full time with medical and health benefits worker.  Amazon.com in
its structure is very much temporary in design and sort of against normal face to face communications in a full time with benefits working society.  It is okay for a dark comedy of the 1990's more reminiscent of a Beatnik from the 1950's.  Clockwatcher's is,
a film I first watched under normal full time working with unfair taxes and full medical  benefits in society's normal structures of commercial cable tv movie channel subscriptions... Clockwatcher's is a real blast from the past in films- I think this also highlights a time in U.S. History which was the first time The Clinton's were in office in the White House in the mid 1990's in American two-party politics.  Apparently there were problems with temporary employees finding their place of joy in corporate business offices while working as temporary amateurs alongside normal and so-called professional full-time employees with full medical benefits in corporate society at this time.  Apparently it highlights indirectly a licensing problem most often recognized more in radio studios than in any other type of mixed media.  Radio actually requires licensing of both amateurs and professionals unlike any other type of media.  I think it is fascinating to look back at periods of America through films.
