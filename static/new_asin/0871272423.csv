8278551,3,0871272423,"It is very difficult to find recorded examples of ""ballets d'action"", the kind of narrative ballets that Mr. Noverre championed in the second half of the XVIIIth century. ""Medea"" was his masterpiece and the coreography existed in two different versions. This one is a ""reconstruction"" of the first, smaller version, the one presented at Stuttgart in 1763. The second version was a more ambitious affair, presented at Paris in 1780.
As it is the only existing record of the ballet, it becomes difficult to evaluate its merits. The lead is mimed, more than danced, by Miss Dawn-Marie Gottlieb. She's quite a remarkable actress, but as the steps used are not the ones we associate to classical dance, I will refrain from judging her as a dancer.
The ballet was produced by semi-amateur actors and dancers of the Dance Department of the University of New Mexico, and it's quite an acceptable document. I understand there is another reconstruction, presented by the Ballet du Rhin of France a couple of years ago. As I don't believe it is available commercially, I think I could recommend this one.",1067817600,3,1093,4.9135135135135135
