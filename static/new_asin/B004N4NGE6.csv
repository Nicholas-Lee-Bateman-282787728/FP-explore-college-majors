But, I am super bummed out about not having the 4th episode included in the complete series box. Overall very happy customer ",1457568000,3,294,4.547169811320755
8436421,5,B004N4NGE6,"First of all, I love Hana Kimi ever since I watched it online. It is one of my favorite dramas. I crack up at every silly antic these kids do. I love the character development and interactions. The friendships are string in this one. It really brightens a bad day watching one of these eps. I was really happy to finally buy a boxset. I don't know if this is an official licensed boxset or not, but if it is, they made a whopping mistake by NOT HAVING EP 4 ON ANY OF THE DVDs. REALLY? The subtitles aren't the greatest, but honestly, they're decent. You still get the humor across. I'm just very upset that I paid for a boxset that's missing an episode. Don't make the same mistake, kiddos. Save your money, wait for another company or subtitler to produce a boxset in the future. Don't buy from these guys, bc whoever there are, you won't get the full series. Again, EP 4 IS MISSING.

Hana Kimi the show is wonderful. Watch it online. You will be stitched laughing. Just don't buy this boxset. It's defective.",1456531200,6,1010,4.372340425531915
8436422,5,B004N4NGE6,"If you want to watch a realistic light-hearted romance, this is *not* the Jdrama for you.  This drama is borderline ridiculous...and I loved every minute of it!  There were times I had to grab a tissue because I was laughing so hard it made me cry.  Not sure if you'd get the humor?  Google ""hana kimi funny"" and watch some of the video clips.  However, almost every episode has a thread of serious drama running through it, which I found refreshing compared to American TV.",1402617600,3,474,4.529411764705882
