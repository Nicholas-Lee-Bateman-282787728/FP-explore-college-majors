But, The title episode, Pest of the West, seemed a bit rushed and not up to normal standards. also, Th Krusty Plate and Pat No Pay are both only half length, and did not create big laughs for me. The special features are very good, with some very short ""episodes"". If you love Spongebob, buy this right away. If you don't, you are better off with some of the first DVDs, like Nautical Nonsence.",1219104000,4,446,4.321428571428571
