1716209,4,B000067J12,I first watched these videos in a college anatomy and physiology class. I was so intrigued by the interesting and touching way that they brought forth the information that I needed to own it myself. I watch the videos at least once or twice a month and they always bring new information. Never call documentaries boring again!,1232928000,2,326,4.7368421052631575
1716210,4,B000067J12,"The focus of this TV series is on brain disorders, on how different malfunctions, diseases or abuses of brain manifest in the brain.  The issues covered range from premature birth, where the brain didn't have yet chance to fully develop, through drug abuse in teenagers, schnizophrenia, seizures, strokes, parkinson's, alzheimer's and natural aging.

I suppose since this series is partly finances by pharmaceutical industry and companies involved in furthering of medical technology, here these companies play Gods and the solutions often involved drugging the person and when that doesn't work taking half of the brain out - as in the part of the episodes related to seizures, which starts to resemble something taking out of X-files.  Throughout the episodes, human beings play the role of guinea pigs, sometimes voluntarily, sometimes involuntarily.  The messages that runs as an undercurrent in these episodes is for the most part that people are helpless, drugs are the answer and if drugs cannot help them, nothing can.  Part of it is almost like a commercial for drugs.

There is a woman who suffered from depression, until she started taking Prozac, at which point she started to have a productive and reasonably well-adjusted life.  There was just a little problem that the dose of the drug she was taking over the past decade has increased eightfold because it just doesn't have the same effect any more.

It's only at the end of the movie, when a couple of people who are over 90 years old and whose brains seem to be working better then people half their age that we see that human beings are not exactly helpless over what happens with their brains, that keeping oneself active mentally and physically and having the desire and the will to live productive life makes a huge difference.  In this series that was almost mentioned just like an after-thought.  And there were people involved in pharmaceutical industry working hard on trying to discover drugs that can possibly replace the mental and physical activity i.e.  they are studying people who are actually taking active care in their mental and physical lives, in an attempt to reproduce drugs that would bring about the same effects in those who may prefer just popping a pill than exercising their minds and bodies.  There is certain economy present all across the nature, which we often refer to as ""use it or lose it"" and this is present when it comes to our mental and physical abilities and when it comes to neurons and neural connections - if you keep on using you mind, your body, learning new things and developing new abilities, your brain will keep on functioning great, if you stop developing your brain through new learnings, parts of your brain being to shut off from lack of use.",1169510400,18,2765,4.897216274089936
1716211,5,B000067J12,"Yes, yes, of course, you would learn much more about the brain by reading great books by neuroscientists--try Joseph LeDoux and Antonio Damasio, for instance. And, no, this isn't a deep and thorough scientific look at the inner space of the brain. But who cares? It's all worth it to see these amazing scientists speak with great enthusiasm about the brain--it's capacity and plasticity and vulnerability, as well as what happens when something goes wrong. I show bits of this to students in corporate courses about emotional intelligence and it's just a heck of a lot better than any lecture I could cook up or some powerpoint presentation on the topic. The graphics are great, and the human stories of brain disorders, while sad (and frankly a little tiring to watch over and over), nevertheless work to give the series emotional impact of its own. Students keep watching to see what will happen next, and the stories give staying power to the learning points. I think this is a must for 30 and 40-somethings, because it gives us a view into the baby's brain, the child's brain, the teenage brain, the adult brain, and the aging brain. If you are interested in any of these disorders or conditions, you'll find something useful in this video set: premature birth, language and learning disorders, schizophrenia, addiction, depression, post-traumatic stress, brain damage from stroke, alzheimer's.",1099008000,67,1398,5.030172413793103
1716212,5,B000067J12,"This series from PBS is an excellent, accessible introduction to developmental neuroscience. It was developed for a lay audience, but professionals will also find the information and the visuals of great interest. I have been using excerpts from this series in professional trainings since the series was first broadcast in 2001 to the applause and appreciation of all of my students. My family and friends are also raving about this series. If you are professionally or personally interested in psychology, neuroscience, and development you will not be dissappointed.

1716214,4,B000067J12,I have watched 4 of these cassettes and I am again amazed at the complexity and organization of a human's headquarters. Every knowledge we have about brain is gained through practical tests and we see a lot of such physology related tests in these videos. They give insight to how neurologist work with brain to understand it. I especially liked the second video telling the story of language learning.,1050883200,6,402,4.840579710144928

Was a bit disappointed though on the section of the teenage brain, I was hoping they would focus more on development of the brain during the teenage years but they mostly focused on Schizophrenia and a bit on drugs.",1458518400,,246,4.488888888888889

What is the brain?  It's that part of the central nervous system encased within the skull.

This series explores the new map of nature's most complicated organ that has emerged from modern neuroscience.

There are five parts to this documentary:

(1) The baby's brain (49 min, 30 sec)
(2) The child's brain (51 min)
(3) The teenage brain (51 min, 30 sec)
(4) The adult brain (51 min)
(5) The aging brain (52 min)

The way this program proceeds (and the way medicine proceed generally) is to investigate what goes wrong with the brain at each of these stages of human life.  Thus, the viewer learns about such things as premature babies, dyslexia, schizophrenia, addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, paralysis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

This five-episode documentary gets its information across through a mixture of personal histories, expert commentary, and excellent animation.

As you can imagination, a documentary on the brain can be quite complicated.  What this documentary does is to give the most important information while concentrating on personal histories.  The result?  The viewer never feels bogged down with technical jargon and gets to focus on the personal histories (which I found to be quite interesting and absorbing).

Note that there are no subtitles but there is closed-captioning.

Finally the DVD set (released in 2002) has one extra: an interview with the director.

In conclusion, this documentary proves that you don't have to be a ""brain"" to understand the brain!!!

(2001; 4 hours, 15 min excluding end material and end credits;  5 episodes; 7 chapters per episode;  3 discs;  wide screen, PBS)

I liked the occupational therapy by Dr. Taub in Alabama for patients recovering from strokes.

Otherwise, the PBS video emphasizes intense and discomforting drama, scientific fluff, and medical intervention.

The video also describes the unnecessary maiming of ferrets.",1280361600,4,295,5.837209302325581
