My 5yr old watched this the entire time we kept it, and was very upset that we had to return it.  So I am more than thrilled that Santa will be giving this to him on Christmas morning!

Rovio & Sony are such conglomerates now, good luck contacting them to find out.

Not sure why, well maybe I am (money) they are splitting up the Seasons in the U.S. but these are the very same episodes you have come to love/hate previously released.

I made some enquiries and was told that the Birds made essentially the same sounds they make in the game. Okay, one hurdle down. Then I asked what the story-lines were like. I was told, ""Don't worry...if you like the game, you'll like the cartoons. They're like...well, they're like the game, but on steroids."" Really? I decided I had to see for myself.

5993111,5,B00FI1QXTS,"Angry Birds and those mischievous Piggies from the uber-popular apps and video games now have their own cartoon, ANGRY BIRDS TOONS! The first cartoons of the series are now available on ANGRY BIRDS TOONS, SEASON 1, VOL. 1. There are 26 cartoons total on this volume. The overall humor and style of animation reminds me of the classic Warner Brother Looney Toons. However, these cartoons are really short. They are only about 2  - 3 minutes long each. Here's a list of each of the episodes on the disc:

1. ""Chuck Time"" - Red falls off a cliff and Chuck does what he can to save him.
2. ""Where's My Crown"" - King Pig loses his crown.
3. ""Full Metal Chuck"" - Chuck tries to train the Blues.
4. ""Another Birthday"" - a nameless Pig has a birthday, but no one in Pig world seems to care.
5. ""Egg Sounds""
6. ""Pig Talent"" - there's a talent show at the castle of King Pig.
7. ""Cordon Bleugh"" - Matilda makes a stew for the Angry Birds that's disgusting.
8. ""True Blue""
9. ""Do As I Say!""
10. ""Off Duty"" - Red is sent on a vacation by the other birds.
11. ""Slingshot 101""
12. ""Thunder Chuck"" - Chuck is guarding the eggs, but he's afraid of thunder.
13. ""Gardening with Terence""
14. ""Dopeys on a Rope""
15. ""Trojan Egg""
16. ""Double Take""
17. ""Crash Test Piggies""
18. ""Sloppy-Go-Lucky""
19. ""Sneezy Does It""
20. ""Run Chuck Run"" - Chuck thinks he will win a race, but when Terence shows up he's not so sure. This is a homage to the old ""Tortoise and the Hare"" story.
21. ""Hypno Pig"" - a group of Pigs hypnotize Red and instead of stealing eggs, play around with him.
22. ""Eggs Day Out""
23. ""Gate Crashers""
24. ""Hog Roast"" - the Pigs try to have a barbecue, but things get out of hand. The first part of this cartoon is a homage to the old Keystone Cops black and white serials.
25. ""The Bird That Cried Pig"" - Bomb keeps getting all of the praise for saving and protecting the eggs even though Chuck is the real hero. He sets up a plan that he's sure will win him some praise.
26. ""Hamshank Redemption"" - a Pig is thrown in prison and keeps trying different ways to get out. There are a few visual references (as well as to the title) the Stephen King story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.""

There are a few extras on the DVD, including some behind the scenes look at Rovio (that place looks almost as fun to work at as Google). Also, there's the first ANGRY BIRDS TOONS cartoon that was used as the pilot. It's called ""Wreck the Halls."" It's a Christmas cartoon. The animation is a little different from the animation of the series, but the overall type of humor and style is still there.

Overall, ANGRY BIRDS TOONS, SEASON 1, VOLUME 1 is a pretty humorous DVD. Fans of Angry Birds will probably enjoy it, but it's just a good cartoon series overall, so that a fan of classic cartoons who has never seen, played, or heard of Angry Birds will it.",1390521600,18,2847,4.29608938547486
