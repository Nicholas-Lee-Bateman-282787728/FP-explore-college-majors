PS.  The gal has such a messy room she either hurts herself or a date she brings home and he runs away.  (It's been a while so I don't remember which one it was.)",1482192000,,380,3.8205128205128207
8646651,1,B00IYXPLX6,"I bought this because I have read Marie Kondo's book and thought that this would be a video explanation that I could get my husband to watch. However, it is just a very badly acted drama with a bad script that includes unrelated irrelevant incidents. The characters do hire someone to declutter their spaces. They do talk about some of the aspects of Marie Kondo's method but only very generally and not in a way that is informative at all. If you are looking for information about KonMari method you will not find it here.",1443398400,,523,4.515789473684211
8646652,5,B00IYXPLX6,"This is such a charming movie about the Konmari method of getting your house and your life in order. I couldn't get my husband to read the book but when he saw the movie with me, he got on board. Now his T-shirts are folded vertically in the drawer right next to the socks which are rolled up like little sushi rolls. We're going to do books and paper next. :)",1433980800,3,360,4.084507042253521
