8591743,5,B00DCG36KA,I'm a big fan of concert videos and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this production.  The package includes both blu-ray and DVD versions of the concert.  Video and audio quality is superb and GP and the Rumor deliver a great concert.  I highly recommend this set.  Enjoy.,1461888000,,284,4.73469387755102

8591746,3,B00DCG36KA,"I wanted to like this set I really did.  And it is getting 3 stars only because I can't give it 2 and a 1/2.  Things to keep in mind.  GP and the Rumour had only just gotten back together and started to record their comeback CD.  When Judd Apatow asked them to be in This Is 40 they quickly rehearsed some of the old material and recorded this concert.  Unfortunately that is what it sounds like, rushed together.  The band is not tight as they used to be, the songs are performed slowly there is little fire or energy here.  And I hate to say it because I'm creeping up and the same age, but at times it really looks like 6 old men up on stage.  Fortunately the recorded 3 Chords Good after this which is an amazing comeback album, it's a shame the didn't record this after they finished 3 Chords.",1381449600,12,798,4.136363636363637
8591747,4,B00DCG36KA,"This is about 50 minutes of a concert that was filmed by Judd Apatow, for partial/scene inclusion in his movie ""This Is 40"", which I haven't yet seen but which includes I understand, as a plotline, Graham Parker & the Rumour being signed to Paul Rudd's character's record label, for their big comeback (Rudd actually introduces the band  at the very beginning).  This apparently is the entire show, filmed at the Belasco here in LA.  The footage looks great, of course, since it was properly lit, well-covered and in the directorial hands of Apatow.  A nice mix of some classics (including five songs from ""Squeezing Out Sparks"") plus a couple of new tracks from ""Three Chords Good"", GP&R's reunion album from last year.  Performances are pretty tight, considering they hadn't played together in about 30 years.  I wish this disc/concert were longer, as there are still plenty of tunes I'd like to have heard (no ""Don't Ask Me Questions"", ""Mercury Poisioning"", ""Heat Treatment"", etc), and the sound is really good.  If you pop for this, and don't already own the Rockpalast set, picking that one up is VERY highly recommended - you can compare & contrast (see link below)
