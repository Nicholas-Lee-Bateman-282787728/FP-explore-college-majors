1909400,3,B0000AZT2H,"I agree with what the previous reviewers have said. We didn't expect this to be something someone taped off of their TV with ads for other shows and network logos on the screen here and there. We wished there could have been menus for easier navigation.

The packaging is not the best. The plastic box came damaged and one DVD was slightly cracked but could still be watched. The set looked home-made, and overall it's not as professional a set as you'd expect for that price.

All that said, it is a wonderful program and that doesn't reflect at all on the way it is being presented here. I wish someone could get the series, put it out and package it properly with decent navigation and perhaps an insert of information about the show and its cast. For this price, we expected more.

This is a great series with legendary stars. It's as funny and innovative (or more so) than anything of recent years, and worth having in any collection. It deserves to be watched and enjoyed however you can get it, but it deserves better than this.",1205971200,8,1035,4.49468085106383
1909401,3,B0000AZT2H,"The Burns and Allen Show is one of the funniest programs ever made. It's a real pity that no quality company has seen fit to release it on DVD. This set is exceedingly frustrating. It consists of poorly-made DVD-Rs (home recordings, not factory pressed) in a flimsy package. Three of the discs arrived scratched because their holders were either broken or warped to the point where the disc won't remain in place. The discs themselves have no menus or chapter stops, and there is no insert or episode guide beyond the glued-on labels. The sound quality and levels vary so much from scene to scene and episode to episode that you have to watch with the remote in hand. The picture quality is equally bad, ranging from near impossible to watch to acceptable.

Miserable as this release is, I wouldn't part with it because the episodes themselves are priceless. If you're just discovering George and Gracie then buy another release -Only a true fan could sit through it.  But if you're already a fan, you have to own this one.",1201737600,17,1023,4.677777777777778

These were the first Burns & Allen shows that my husband and I had ever seen, and since we aren't old enough to have enjoyed them back when they first came out on TV, we had always figured they were old b&w shows with old jokes, done on an obvious stage; so they must be boring.  But we couldn't believe how funny and smart these shows are!  Sure, some of the jokes are old, but they pull them off the way they were meant to be done, so they're still hilarious (or maybe I should say they've become hilarious again.)  Sure, it's done on a stage, but they never try to pretend to the audience that they're house is real.  George Burns will step through the living room wall to talk to the audience whenever he wants to.  Genius.  The way they just have a short conversation about Carnation Milk (the sponsor) instead of having commercials is so funny.  (Sort of like Kyle XY and their Sour Patch Kids.)  Who's been hiding this show from the younger folks?  Burns & Allen isn't just for the older generation anymore.",1201651200,12,1335,5.532019704433497
1909403,4,B0000AZT2H,"I purchased this CD for my mother who has fond memories of these shows.  I watched them with her and enjoyed them.  I would much rather have a commercial for Carnation Milk thrown into the performance than watch 5 minutes of programming and 5 minutes of commercial as we often do today!  The picture quality isn't perfect, but what you see is what people saw on their TV's back then.  Technology certainly wasn't what we have today, but that what you would expect when you purchase these CD's.  I was happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others.",1169164800,17,558,4.54
1909404,4,B0000AZT2H,"Who can't help but enjoy Gracie Allen's humor, nor George Burns dry wit. These were the early episodes, I prefer the later ones where they were not filmed on what was apparent as a 'real' stage setting, as in plays.",1167782400,12,215,4.4
1909405,4,B0000AZT2H,"If I were rating this on the material alone, I would easily give it 5 stars -- they really don't make shows like this anymore.  However, the quality of the production leaves something to be desired.  There are pops and cuts, and a few places where the audio and video are out of sync.

But what I find most frustrating is that there are no menus, and no easy way to navigate between episodes.  The disc automatically starts playing the first episode, and hitting ""next chapter"" on my remote brings up the next scene but won't let me advance to the next episode until this one has completed playing.

I'm determined to watch every frame of this great series.  I won't have fun getting them set up each time, but in a way, it's worth it.",1151798400,26,735,4.367647058823529

1909417,5,B0000AZT2H,A great comedy couple.  Enjoyed their television series as a young adult and am enjoying some of them again. I wasn't pleased with the condition of the dvd case.  This Iitem was not packaged very well for shipping.  The case is made out of cardboard and was smached flat when it arrived. There was no protective cushion around it.

1909418,4,B0000AZT2H,"George and Gracie - mainly Gracie - always cracked me up and this disk is no exception. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the technical difficulty of reproducing these old television shows, that were not made with posterity in mind, was painfully obvious in some of the episodes.  But I am still delighted to have it.",1423353600,3,335,4.491803278688525
1909419,5,B0000AZT2H,"I find this show to be a standout for shows of it's time.  I love the way that George Burns breaks the ""forth wall"" by talking to the audience about the show that is being staged around him.  Some of the jokes are pretty corny but what do you expect?  Some of the bits were taken from the Burn's and Allen's Vaudeville routine.  Gracie Allen is a comedic genius on par with Lucille Ball and George Burns is perhaps the greatest ""straight man"" ever.

As far as this DVD goes: I received a single disc with three shows on it housed in a paper sleeve.  Most of these shows are available on YouTube so I am not too sure that I will make this purchase again.",1421971200,5,653,4.142857142857143

Some video/audio problems with original elements make the first couple episodes a little difficult to watch in HD however the quality noticeably increases as you go along in the series which is a real relief to the viewer. It's such a fine show. The rapport and chemistry between George and Gracie is legendary and they're quite brilliant together. The shows get richer as the series continues so if you can get over the hump of the first few episodes (quality was apparently bad on the original elements), you'll come to really enjoy and appreciate why this show is such a classic and favorite among folks of all ages.

1909425,5,B0000AZT2H,"First of all this review is for the 2-volume, 16 DVDs set by NOSTALGIA MERCHANT. No complaints at all about picture or sound quality.  Remember, these shows are from the earliest days of television. You can't expect HD but these are clearly not burns from old DVDs. Very well done.  Now the real review:
 Gracie, Gracie, Gracie.  Could you be any more lovable?!  I doubt it's possible.  She's a character that should be just plain annoying.  But she emphatically is NOT.  George Burns said over and over again that he had found pure gold when he found Gracie.  You'll see why.  He is her perfect, very loving and funny straight man.  But Gracie is the show.  You will find yourself just smiling every time you see her.  Nobody else could pull off this character like Gracie Allen.  I'd never seen this TV show before, tho I had heard of it.  I found the station ""Ant TV"" by accident and it plays the Burns and Allen Show late at night.  I'm very glad to have discovered this true classic.  This set of DVD's starts at the beginning in 1950 and goes thru to about 1953.  The episodes on television are from the last couple of years it aired and have a sightly different premise about them. (They're real son, Ronnie, becomes part of this cast.)  They are every bit as funny as the early shows seen on these DVDs.  It's nice that this set is completely different from what you can find on TV,  At the end of these later shows George and Gracie come out and do some of their vaudeville bits and they are truly funny.  In the earlier shows you see that they work them into the show and are just as funny.  You can't lose watching The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.  I defy anyone to watch these shows and not fall absolutely in love with Gracie.  If you don't, I'm pretty sure you're not somebody I'd like to spend time with.

1909433,5,B0000AZT2H,"The George Burns Gracie Allen - 40 Episodes is a great collection dispite a few bugs.  Most of these episodes are true classics with Jack Benny appearing in two of the episodes and Sheldon Leonard appearing in one.  The discs are DVDr's, there are no chapter menus, and 14 of the episodes were retrieved from faded-over-time video cassette recordings off of secondary sources such as CBN and TV Land.  However, there are 26 full length excellent quality episodes.  These include all of the episodes on the first, second, third, and seventh discs along with the fourth episode on disc five, the fifth episode on disc six, and the first four episodes on disc eight.  All the episodes on this collection are watchable, but it is highly recommended to watch this collection using a smart DVD software player on a computer.

It is said to be digitally remastered. The clarity is very good quality considering it is 1950. The sound, well that part they forgot to remaster, it has to be high to hear what they are saying sometimes.
As for Burns, his lines were about half good jokes and the delivery of his was not that great. Good thing he was an excellent writer.
For the bad news... this particular one, there are only two episodes. The third didn't make it on the disk and the first episode was copied twice. So the first and third episode are the same. Oh well, they are good anyway.",1215302400,,690,4.348837209302325

This Delta release offers four early kinescopes in reasonably good quality. Along with George and Gracie's timeless routines, you also get Bill Goodwin's contrived plugs for Carnation Evaporated Milk.

7997915,4,B0000AZT2H,"A selection of 64 episodes out of 291 episodes produced over an eight year run. I am not sure of the criteria used to select these particular episodes but for the most part they are good to great. The packaging is scimpy so you are left to your own devices to figure out when the episodes were first broadcast. Unfortunately the episode titles as listed differ from what's available on Wikipedia. So far I have deduced that the first 8 discs range from 1950 to 1953.

The quality of the material varies widely with the kinescope from the live shows being the most problematic. Fortunately nothing is so bad as to be unenjoyable. The live commercials are annoying at times but sometimes they are cleverly integrated into the comedy. The filmed episodes are in better shape but have odd cuts where the commercials that were integrated into the show have been removed. Some of the later episodes have short introductions that were filmed for repeat showings on the network. These are also odd as they introduce the episodes as flashbacks. In one of them George Burns promises a new episode the following week!

Regardless of the technical issues, these shows are a delight especially with their wall bending premises between Gracie's illogical logic and twisting of language to George's constant breaking of the fourth wall with the viewer yet still a hapless victim of the script. Plus this is a show about the characters lives outside of making this show which is a strange concept in itself.",1488931200,,1491,4.797665369649805
