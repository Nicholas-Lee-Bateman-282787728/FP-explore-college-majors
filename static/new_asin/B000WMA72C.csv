2984451,5,B000WMA72C,"Comedy series collectors, our prayers were finally answered: The second season of ""Two and a Half Men"" is coming out, more than two and a half years after its season finale airing. Hey, two and a half years? I think this number is a coincidence with the series title...maybe this was made on purpose!

In a time where TV seasons - even the least successful ones - are released on DVD within six months or less from its finales, letting ""Two and a Half Men"" be out of the DVD market for such a long time was, at least, an odd attitude. Even more oddly is to figure that some other countries (like England) have already this set for sale for a while.

From the 24 episodes of this second season (which occasionally still airs on CW), there is no one of them I could call a lame one. As for the 4-DVD set, we can expect the obvious: more interviews, more deleted scenes, more episode commentaries and more outtakes. Based on what I've seen in the UK version, fun is more than guaranteed with this DVD-set.",1192752000,13,1002,4.352941176470588

2984675,5,B000WMA72C,"Two and a Half Men was really funny when Charlie Sheen was in his role on the sitcom, and Angus Young was also priceless as the young kid. Charlie of course did a terrible thing reciting his own anger at one of the producers. Anybody, technical people or actors, that you definitely do not offend a producer of a show. I half wonder if Charlie and Angus knew that Angus' age would make him not a little kid anymore, and the show would not be nearly as funny, so they made a pact-decision with one of the producers of the TV show. Charlie would be upset, he would be fired from the show, Angus didn't have to be on the show nearly as much, and the show would deal with the outcome of any ""shenanigans"" that the public might perceive happened. In my opinion maybe, that one of the producers wasn't really mad, Charlie didn't really offend one of the producers, and the show has gone on regardless of how Charlie's' character would be ""eliminated"" from the cast. I have not liked the show since. It's not nearly close to being funny anymore, which is probably what the producers, Angus, and Charlie knew it would be, and they decided to make a ""disaster"" of Charlie's character going away, dying as it was made.",1378598400,3,1208,4.42152466367713

2984696,4,B000WMA72C,"Chuck Lorre is a brilliant man; a complex but calm man who has realized that as the boss in a performing arts company he must remain calm and staid because almost no one else will, He got his start, as most of the Hollywood writing staff did, on Roseanne, where his writing skills were honed under the demands of a woman who planned out an entire series between season two and three.
Roseanne was making a plug for women's rights and it centered on the fact that women were capable of doing just about anything. Sadly, in the late 80'ws and early 90's the methods she used were by making men seem like idiots. John Goodman is not only a brilliant actor and a man who clearly wanted out of his  contract in season nine, managed to come across as a wonderful man; a feminist who refused to give up his maleness. Still, we watched Roseanne hit him in the head with a cast iron skillet one too many times. When Roseanna (who had a philosophy that any writer had one or two good season in him and then it was time to cut him loose- she was wrong) released Lorre, he went on to create Dharma and Greg, Becker, Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. Lorre manages to do well by surrounding himself with outstanding people and allowing them to do their jobs. There is plenty of laughter on the set and Charlie Sheen aside, there are no ""stars"" on his shows. The Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of ensemble work we haven't seen since Marta Kaufman and David Crane gave us ""Friends.""
 Two and a Half Men is about two unmarried brothers. Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen), two years older, who has managed a career as a musician writing jingles for advertising- bringing in vast amounts of money, a house on Malibu Beach and an endless supply of single malt scotch. Alan (Jon Cryer) is an anal retentive chiropractor- not quite a doctor- who was kicked out of his home a la Felix Unger by his wife of twelve years named Judith.(Marin Hatch) They share custody of a boy, Jake (expertly played by Angus T. Jones) whp is lazy, fraqnk and has the typical locker room humor of a young adolescent. The premise- at first- was to see how an adolescent boy would co-exist with a single uncle who is living with a Peter Pan comp-lex, bringing in woman after woman foir meaningless one night stands, developing a reputation where by almost anywhere he goes woman are saying ""Hi, Charlie"" or ""Charlie, you filthy creep! You ruined my life.""
 On the surface, Alan comes across as the better behaved of the two and we strongly suspect that Lorre intended this. However, Alan begins to make up for last time and despite the many jokes about Charlie thinking with his penis, we noticed that soon enough Alans penis was doing all of HIS thinking and at a substantially lower IQ than that of Charlie's. Aolan spends all of his time comp0laining about how easily things come to Charlie while he has had t5o dfight for every single failure in his life. What is left to us to see is that Charlie has just as many challenges and failures as Alan but has learned not to complain about them. His relaxed attitude serves him better than Alan's constant anxiety and explosive diarrhea. Still, it is often Charlie who gets a surprise trip to the Emergency room. Charlie is the one who's got a stalker and had his testicles super glued to his thighs. Charlie is the one who is a kind man and wants nothing more than kindness in return. Alan is unable to see this and thus feels great jealousy about the fact that he feels that he struggles and struggles, loses everything, while Charlie has gold falling from the sky.
 Alan wastes every opportunity he has. His second marriage comes about a year and a half after Judith has thrown him out and he ends up in a weekend long sex marathon with a girl whose body is spectacular and her very loe I.Q. somehow makes her even more sexy. She is enamored by Alan;s sweetness and doesn;lt mind that she is half his age. She struts around the house in a bikini, to the delight of young Jakes and, during a foolish moment in Las Vegas, Alan marries her. Fifteen minutes later a single coin in the slot wins him a half million dollars and then four months after that she has thrown him out and he has eleven dollars left.;
 And Charlie is the fool?
 The show doesn't make any attempts to teach us lessons and this is nice. After all we wept through Family Ties, M*A*S*H*, Designing Women and even Roseanna, but it is nice to have a TV series where there is never any growth- a pure half hour of comedy.
 As each season passes we see that both men are destroyed by childhood issues stemming from a terrible mother played expertly by the clkassic Holland Taylor). The boys father died when they were swtill in elementary school by food poisoning of fish. ""( I was a new housewife and learning to cook, "": Said Evelyn- their mother, ""How was I to know that fish couldn't be kept in a drawer? ""
 Charlie contends that his father KNEW the fish was bad and he ate it anyway. Alan refuses to discuss it. After his death came a string of ""Uncles"" who helped to raise the boys. Alan became the type A child who did anything he could to please but never succeeded. Charlie simply began to drink and have indiscriminate sex. They endured boarding school, Charlie got out as fast as he could and Alan married a duplicate of his mother. Alan gets reamed for both Alimony and Child Support. He loses the house, all the money, the furniture and the car. Why? Because Charlie couldn't heolp himself and slept with, then dumped, Alan;s attorney.
 Similar episodes occurred with Jake's Karate teacher, den mother, fifth grade teacher and countless others. Charlie falls in love more often and Alan ends up in terrible situations because off his loud but stupid penis. (a true highlight is his venture into computer dating when Alison JAnney plays a date who leaves, saying good night to Charlie, explaining she has to get up for work and that Alan has turned into bed for the night. Charlie who is plagued by being in love with a ballet dancer who will be traveling, enters Alan's room to see him cuffed at fours in red stockings, arm gloves and leather corset and panties.
 Alison Janney is an excellent example of the remarkable guest stars that visit this show. Martin Sheen plays an emotionally unbalanced father of Charlie's stalker, Rose (perhaps the gem of the series), Robert Wagner plays the boys father and as a result of a fun conversation between Chuck Lorre and the creator of CSI, a switch of writing staffs occur creating a hysterical episode here and a wonderful CSI parody. CLoris Leachman  moves in next door, Sean Penn and Elvis Costello play themselves in a support group with Charlie. Martin Mull is a remarkable pharmacist trying to compete with the larger chains and copes by delving into the sample drawers. He pays three sets of alimony but not a cent of child support. It goes on and on.
 The gem of the series is Conchetta Ferrall who plays Berta, Charlie's housekeeper who does much more than keeps house. She is part of the family and her wit and wisdom is curt and cute. Nothing disgusts her (one morning after finding a bra abd panties on the kitchen table with the bananas and the butter says, ""Good God, I'm workin;' for Caligula."" She's a good woman, the mother of a handful of failure girls for whom she'd face a meth chemist to extort $5,000 in pre-paid child support. She could have only five lines in a scene and still manage to steal it. The house can't run without Berta and she and Charlie have a strong relationship, well defined and honed over the course of many years.
 Okay. The writing is full of 8th grade fart jokes but they're cleverly written so that one must delve into intelligence to get the meaning. There's a great deal of gas, as a result of a 12 year old boy who will (and can) eat anything and has no shame. We have watched only up to season six and we suppose that there's not a soul in America who has not heard of the medical condition that crashed Charlie Sheen. We have not seen that final season as his illness took him down nor have we viewed any of the new seasons with the adorable and perpetually adolescent Ashton Kutcher. The series is approaching it';s 200tgh episode, something rarely seen in television so that there are 8 seasons before Mr Sheen's illness affects the show- if at all. We will revisit this subject when the time comes, but in the mean time, score this one as a way of understanding men- of making up for the men hating Roseanne and at looking at two emotionally damaged men and why. All the women in this series are depicted as equally damaged with the expception of Berta and Charlie's stalker. There is the regular appearance of a therapist- a [psychiatrist who still does therapy at $250 an hour and from time to time all two and a half men have sat with her. She played a phys ed teacher on Old Christine and now has a lead in the show Glee- the only actress in Hollywood taller than Alison Janney, she spends most of her scenes seated in her expensive chair making jokes at the expens fo Charlie or Alan and helping them to come to terms with what haunts them.
 Yes, it took us years to open our arms to Two and a half Men because at first, it appears to be arm-pit farts and network Pokys, but it is ever so much more. This is a good one for everyone and even more so for any man who has been under the control over the stronger sex.",1356652800,,9421,4.438150289017341
2984697,5,B000WMA72C,"Because I love this show. All of them are good. I prefer Charlie on the show of coarse but unlike other reviews I have read, the new ones are ok too. Naturally not the same as Charlie but how could they be? Ashton is funny but one has to understand he isn't trying to be Charlie. If they could bring Charlie back like they do on the soap operas, it would be great. But we have to adjust I guess. No need to be childish about it. It's just another one of life's disappointments.",1356566400,,477,4.085106382978723

He was watching an episode of Two and a Half Men.  I stayed and watched and became hooked.  I bought this DVD for him -- so he could have a good laugh whenever needed.,1236643200,2,329,3.8656716417910446
2984770,5,B000WMA72C,"I've kept up with the series over the past few years and recently brought the dvds out and watched through the first 4 seasons (all that are available on dvd at the time of this review) again.  Without a doubt, I think the second season is the best of the series.  I wouldn't rate any of the seasons, including the ones I've seen on TV that aren't out on disc yet, below a 3 (or a 3 and a half if that was an option), but I think this is the only season I'd give a perfect 5.  Even having seen all of these episodes three or four times, I still can't stop laughing.

If you've watched the show in syndication on CW or WGN, you've probably seen several of these episodes (the syndication tends to be the first 3 seasons at this point).  I've seen other reviews where people try and list out the best episodes of this season, but it's like trying to tell someone what the best songs on a Beatles album are:  by the time you're done listing, you'll have named about 90% of the episodes in the season.

The 3rd Disc of this season is perfect.  Charlie tries to take Alan to Vegas to ease his brother's fears of a colonoscopy but Alan's semi - OCD gets in the way.  Judith feels the need to go on vacation from her stressful life of cashing alimony checks and leaves Jake with the brothers for a full week.  Charlie and Alan each mess things up in extremely hilarious ways - based on the facial expressions alone, this might be Angus T. Jones best episode as Jake.  Charlie convinces Alan to pretend to be his gay partner to impress an Ad exec - and the ensuing relationship is brilliant, especially when their mom finds out.  Jake loses his portable game system in the coffin of one of his grandmother's ex husbands.

I still enjoy watching new Two and a Half Men on Mondays, but nothing beats this season.  The story lines aren't repetitive yet.  The dialogue is still fresh.  And for me, the most important thing is the characters aren't dumb downed yet.  Charlie is of course still a highly functional drunk, but he's not an idiot.  His one liners are still littered with interesting tidbits and cultural references.  He's not the low brow idiot the writers are quickly turning him into in later seasons.  Alan's awkwardness is still fresh and hilarious.  And as Jake, Angus Jones is the perfect age.  Like the Charlie of later seasons, the writers have decided to really dumb down Jake.  As an 11 year old in season 2, Jake is just a semi-naive kid with a lot of apathy and a few cups of bad influence.

I don't regret buying all of the seasons of the series, but if I could only keep one of them, it would be season 2.  If you caught on to the show late and haven't seen the old episodes yet, this is a great place to start (and by no means is season 1 bad, this is just better if you only want to spend the money on one.)",1235606400,4,2823,4.25140712945591

There's also ""Last Chance to See Those Tattoos,"" where Charlie discovers a website where women gather anonymously to bash him; and ""Yes, Monsignor,"" where Charlie reunites with an old flame, Lisa, who now has a baby (played by Sheen's real-life daughter, Sam).

2984829,5,B000WMA72C,"I have enjoyed watching this series since it first came out the three main characters Charlie played by Charlie Sheen. Charlie's younger brother Alan played by Jon Cryer and Alan's son Jake played by Angus Jones. All live together in Charlie's Malibu Home. Charlie is a successful music writer for various household products writing jingles for commercials such as the famous ""Maple Loop Song"" mentioned in different episodes. Alan is estranged from his wife Judith played by Marin Hinkle. As a result Alan lives with his brother Charlie and Jake stays with his father and uncle most of the time. Watching the show is like coming home to loved ones and best friends at the same time. It is one of the best sitcoms I have ever watched it's funny and heart warming for the most part the characters are all played by seasoned actors. I cant wait for season three and hopefully many more after that. There is no real premise behind the show it just deals with a family going through the growing pains of daily existence as they see it.

2984863,1,B000WMA72C,"Honestly folks, save your cash. The show's definitely nothing special, unless you love the dull thud of jokes falling on their face, punctuated by the oddly sad beats of the always inappropriately amused laugh track. This is truly a 'comedy' for an easily amused, lowest-common-denominator type of audience. Any smart ppl that watch are doing so ironically (and shame on you for enjoying the train wreck).

About the only thing the show has going for it is some servicable acting by the guy who plays the uptight brother (Jon Cryer), but even Cryer is hampered by the fact that is character is not likable in any way.  And worse (MUCH worse, actually) the Charlie Sheen character is a boat anchor around the neck of the proceedings.

Sheen's acting range on the show consists of three facial expressions: blank, smirk, and 'Who, me?'. If Cryer's character is unlikeable, Sheen's alternates between being hate-able and utterly wooden. How this guy still gets work is beyond me... even in his big hit 'Wall Street', he displayed little emotional range, it was really Michael Douglas that made that movie.

The writing on this show is no gem either, always the obvious and crass joke, every time. *You* could write 2.5 Men, and no doubt you could write it better than the show's staff does.

Far as the DVD goes, you can put your money to far better use here on Amazon, trust me. 2.5 Men is as disposable as Charlie Sheen's sanity, and a glaring reminder (warning?) that, much like McDonald's restaurants or Britney Spear's music career, popular does not always = good.",1200960000,11,1566,4.806691449814126
2984864,2,B000WMA72C,"This show is funny, but it is with all of the wrong things. It deals with sex, sex and more sex. That is not the only thing to make jokes about. I know several other struggling comedies on TV that can't make it even though they are absolutley amazing. How I Met Your Mother or 30 Rock are amazing shows that do not base their jokes strictly off sex. (Yes, they do contain it, but it isn't shoved down your throat over and over.)",1199577600,4,428,4.107142857142857
2984865,5,B000WMA72C,"It's funny, witty, a bit sexist sometimes because it's primarily from 2 middle-aged mens' point of views. I love Charlie's charismatic yet nonchalant approach to life and how much he gets off picking on his younger, less-experienced-in-sex brother.

His brother is cool too. They're both laidback, yet his bro is by far the smarter of the two. He's divorced and overly-content with his standings. However, his wife not allowing him to move on bothers him.

All in all, 2 thumbs up!

2984866,5,B000WMA72C,"For a change, Australia is ahead of USA in this release.  I've owned this now for a little while, watched the whole season through, and watched it again.  I love it as it's one of the best tv comedy shows out there.  There are 24 episodes on these disks and this is the way they pan out.
1 - BACK OFF MARY POPPINS - Charlie's male support group includes lots of Hollywood celebrities like Sean Penn and Elvis Costello - but not Alan.
2 - ENJOY THOSE GARLIC BALLS - Alan is jealous that Judith has a new beau ... and delighted that he may be off the hook for alamony.
3 - A BAG FULL OF JAWEA - Teacher's Pet.  Trying to be a good uncle, Charlie romances the teacher who threatened to suspend Jake.
4 - GO GET MOMMY'S BRA - What is Evelyn's bra doing in the back seat of Charlies car?  The answer is ... uh...unnerving.
5 - BAD NEWS FROM THE CLINIC? - Charlies falls for a female verson of himself.  And man, does she make him look miserable.
6 - THE PRICE OF HEALTHY GUMS IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE - Is Alan a Jekyll and Hyde?  A childhood shoplifting story has him convinced there's a ""bad Alan"" inside.
7 - A KOSHER SLAUGHTERHOUSE OUT IN FONTANA - Charlie and Alan's party for Evelyn turns into an affair to remember... for al the wrong reasons.
8 - FRANKENSTEIN AND THE HORNY VILLAGERS - Confusing love and lust, Alan promptly proposes when he dates a woman who's sexually adventurous.
9 - YES, MONSIGNOR - Charlie's old flame Lisa has everything: beauty, wit, intelligence, charm ... and a brand-new baby.
10- THE SALMON UNDER MY SWEATER - Right 'toon, wrong tune.  Jake hates Charlie's theme song for the TV version of his favourite comice book.
11- LAST CHANCE TO SEE THOSE TATTOOS - What a tangled worldwide web we weave.  Charlie discovers he's the subject of an unflattering website.
12- A LUNGFUL OF ALAN - A homely girl Charlie and Alan knew in high school visits - and the boys are in for a surprise.
13 - ZEJDZ Z MOICH WLOSOW (GET OFF MY HAIR) - First an earthquake, then a real disaster: With her house quake damaged, Judith moves into Charlie's beach pad.
14- THOSE BIG PINK THINGS WITH COCONUT - Aland tells Evelyn she's no longer welcome at the house.  But his mother is, as always, a step ahead of him.
15- SMELL THE UMBRELLA STAND - Vegas, baby!  Charlie's attempts to leave for Las Vegas keep coming up snake eyes.
16- CAN YOU EAT HUMAN FLESH WITH WOODEN TEETH? - Faced with a sudden IRS audit, Alan needs someone reliable to take care of Jake.  Someone like ... Charlie?
17- WOO-HOO, A HERNIA EXAM! - Back attack.  When Charlie injures his back, he refuses chiropractic help from Alan.
18- IT WAS ""MAME,"" MOM - Charlie wants to make a good impression at a gay ad exec's party.  So he asks Alan to be his 'date'.
19- A LOW GUTTURAL TONGUE-FLAPPING NOISE - Second best?  Alan is attracted to a beautiful woman who once had a fling with Charlie.
20- I ALWAYS WANTED A SHAVED MONKEY - Angry at the women in their lives, Charlie and Alan do the mature thing.  They turn on each other.
21- A SYMPATHETIC CROTCH TO CRY ON -  The death of Evelyn's second husband Harry, affects everyone in the family differently.
22- THAT OLD HOSE BAG IS MY MOTHER -  He's traded his sould for a Porsche.  That's what Charlie thinks when Alan accepts a car loan from Evelyn.
23- SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB - Bad parenting?  The guys are wracked with guilt after leaving Jake with Evelyn for an evening.
24- DOES THIS SMELL FUNNY TO YOU? -Poetic license.  Jake's ""How I Spent My Weekend"" report differs somewhat from reality.

This show is so hilarious.  Charlie Sheen does a fantastic job of delivering his lines with perfect comic timing and all the cast members are funny too.  Holland Taylor as Evelyn is one of the best, and this show doesn't slow down.  it's no wonder they're always nominated for awards.  I can't wait to see and own the third season.

3218948,5,B000WMA72C,"Comedy series collectors, our prayers were finally answered: The second season of ""Two and a Half Men"" is coming out, more than two and a half years after its season finale airing. Hey, two and a half years? I think this number is a coincidence with the series title...maybe this was made on purpose!

In a time where TV seasons - even the least successful ones - are released on DVD within six months or less from its finales, letting ""Two and a Half Men"" be out of the DVD market for such a long time was, at least, an odd attitude. Even more oddly is to figure that some other countries (like England) have already this set for sale for a while.

From the 24 episodes of this second season (which occasionally still airs on CW), there is no one of them I could call a lame one.

3219172,5,B000WMA72C,"Two and a Half Men was really funny when Charlie Sheen was in his role on the sitcom, and Angus Young was also priceless as the young kid. Charlie of course did a terrible thing reciting his own anger at one of the producers. Anybody, technical people or actors, that you definitely do not offend a producer of a show. I half wonder if Charlie and Angus knew that Angus' age would make him not a little kid anymore, and the show would not be nearly as funny, so they made a pact-decision with one of the producers of the TV show. Charlie would be upset, he would be fired from the show, Angus didn't have to be on the show nearly as much, and the show would deal with the outcome of any ""shenanigans"" that the public might perceive happened. In my opinion maybe, that one of the producers wasn't really mad, Charlie didn't really offend one of the producers, and the show has gone on regardless of how Charlie's' character would be ""eliminated"" from the cast. I have not liked the show since. It's not nearly close to being funny anymore, which is probably what the producers, Angus, and Charlie knew it would be, and they decided to make a ""disaster"" of Charlie's character going away, dying as it was made.",1378598400,3,1208,4.42152466367713

3219193,4,B000WMA72C,"Chuck Lorre is a brilliant man; a complex but calm man who has realized that as the boss in a performing arts company he must remain calm and staid because almost no one else will, He got his start, as most of the Hollywood writing staff did, on Roseanne, where his writing skills were honed under the demands of a woman who planned out an entire series between season two and three.
Roseanne was making a plug for women's rights and it centered on the fact that women were capable of doing just about anything. Sadly, in the late 80'ws and early 90's the methods she used were by making men seem like idiots. John Goodman is not only a brilliant actor and a man who clearly wanted out of his  contract in season nine, managed to come across as a wonderful man; a feminist who refused to give up his maleness. Still, we watched Roseanne hit him in the head with a cast iron skillet one too many times. When Roseanna (who had a philosophy that any writer had one or two good season in him and then it was time to cut him loose- she was wrong) released Lorre, he went on to create Dharma and Greg, Becker, Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. Lorre manages to do well by surrounding himself with outstanding people and allowing them to do their jobs. There is plenty of laughter on the set and Charlie Sheen aside, there are no ""stars"" on his shows. The Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of ensemble work we haven't seen since Marta Kaufman and David Crane gave us ""Friends.""
 Two and a Half Men is about two unmarried brothers. Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen), two years older, who has managed a career as a musician writing jingles for advertising- bringing in vast amounts of money, a house on Malibu Beach and an endless supply of single malt scotch. Alan (Jon Cryer) is an anal retentive chiropractor- not quite a doctor- who was kicked out of his home a la Felix Unger by his wife of twelve years named Judith.(Marin Hatch) They share custody of a boy, Jake (expertly played by Angus T. Jones) whp is lazy, fraqnk and has the typical locker room humor of a young adolescent. The premise- at first- was to see how an adolescent boy would co-exist with a single uncle who is living with a Peter Pan comp-lex, bringing in woman after woman foir meaningless one night stands, developing a reputation where by almost anywhere he goes woman are saying ""Hi, Charlie"" or ""Charlie, you filthy creep! You ruined my life.""
 On the surface, Alan comes across as the better behaved of the two and we strongly suspect that Lorre intended this. However, Alan begins to make up for last time and despite the many jokes about Charlie thinking with his penis, we noticed that soon enough Alans penis was doing all of HIS thinking and at a substantially lower IQ than that of Charlie's. Aolan spends all of his time comp0laining about how easily things come to Charlie while he has had t5o dfight for every single failure in his life. What is left to us to see is that Charlie has just as many challenges and failures as Alan but has learned not to complain about them. His relaxed attitude serves him better than Alan's constant anxiety and explosive diarrhea. Still, it is often Charlie who gets a surprise trip to the Emergency room. Charlie is the one who's got a stalker and had his testicles super glued to his thighs. Charlie is the one who is a kind man and wants nothing more than kindness in return. Alan is unable to see this and thus feels great jealousy about the fact that he feels that he struggles and struggles, loses everything, while Charlie has gold falling from the sky.
 Alan wastes every opportunity he has. His second marriage comes about a year and a half after Judith has thrown him out and he ends up in a weekend long sex marathon with a girl whose body is spectacular and her very loe I.Q. somehow makes her even more sexy. She is enamored by Alan;s sweetness and doesn;lt mind that she is half his age. She struts around the house in a bikini, to the delight of young Jakes and, during a foolish moment in Las Vegas, Alan marries her. Fifteen minutes later a single coin in the slot wins him a half million dollars and then four months after that she has thrown him out and he has eleven dollars left.;
 And Charlie is the fool?
 The show doesn't make any attempts to teach us lessons and this is nice. After all we wept through Family Ties, M*A*S*H*, Designing Women and even Roseanna, but it is nice to have a TV series where there is never any growth- a pure half hour of comedy.
 As each season passes we see that both men are destroyed by childhood issues stemming from a terrible mother played expertly by the clkassic Holland Taylor). The boys father died when they were swtill in elementary school by food poisoning of fish. ""( I was a new housewife and learning to cook, "": Said Evelyn- their mother, ""How was I to know that fish couldn't be kept in a drawer? ""
 Charlie contends that his father KNEW the fish was bad and he ate it anyway. Alan refuses to discuss it. After his death came a string of ""Uncles"" who helped to raise the boys. Alan became the type A child who did anything he could to please but never succeeded. Charlie simply began to drink and have indiscriminate sex. They endured boarding school, Charlie got out as fast as he could and Alan married a duplicate of his mother. Alan gets reamed for both Alimony and Child Support. He loses the house, all the money, the furniture and the car. Why? Because Charlie couldn't heolp himself and slept with, then dumped, Alan;s attorney.
 Similar episodes occurred with Jake's Karate teacher, den mother, fifth grade teacher and countless others. Charlie falls in love more often and Alan ends up in terrible situations because off his loud but stupid penis. (a true highlight is his venture into computer dating when Alison JAnney plays a date who leaves, saying good night to Charlie, explaining she has to get up for work and that Alan has turned into bed for the night. Charlie who is plagued by being in love with a ballet dancer who will be traveling, enters Alan's room to see him cuffed at fours in red stockings, arm gloves and leather corset and panties.
 Alison Janney is an excellent example of the remarkable guest stars that visit this show. Martin Sheen plays an emotionally unbalanced father of Charlie's stalker, Rose (perhaps the gem of the series), Robert Wagner plays the boys father and as a result of a fun conversation between Chuck Lorre and the creator of CSI, a switch of writing staffs occur creating a hysterical episode here and a wonderful CSI parody. CLoris Leachman  moves in next door, Sean Penn and Elvis Costello play themselves in a support group with Charlie. Martin Mull is a remarkable pharmacist trying to compete with the larger chains and copes by delving into the sample drawers. He pays three sets of alimony but not a cent of child support. It goes on and on.
 The gem of the series is Conchetta Ferrall who plays Berta, Charlie's housekeeper who does much more than keeps house. She is part of the family and her wit and wisdom is curt and cute. Nothing disgusts her (one morning after finding a bra abd panties on the kitchen table with the bananas and the butter says, ""Good God, I'm workin;' for Caligula."" She's a good woman, the mother of a handful of failure girls for whom she'd face a meth chemist to extort $5,000 in pre-paid child support. She could have only five lines in a scene and still manage to steal it. The house can't run without Berta and she and Charlie have a strong relationship, well defined and honed over the course of many years.
 Okay. The writing is full of 8th grade fart jokes but they're cleverly written so that one must delve into intelligence to get the meaning. There's a great deal of gas, as a result of a 12 year old boy who will (and can) eat anything and has no shame. We have watched only up to season six and we suppose that there's not a soul in America who has not heard of the medical condition that crashed Charlie Sheen. We have not seen that final season as his illness took him down nor have we viewed any of the new seasons with the adorable and perpetually adolescent Ashton Kutcher. The series is approaching it';s 200tgh episode, something rarely seen in television so that there are 8 seasons before Mr Sheen's illness affects the show- if at all. We will revisit this subject when the time comes, but in the mean time, score this one as a way of understanding men- of making up for the men hating Roseanne and at looking at two emotionally damaged men and why. All the women in this series are depicted as equally damaged with the expception of Berta and Charlie's stalker. There is the regular appearance of a therapist- a [psychiatrist who still does therapy at $250 an hour and from time to time all two and a half men have sat with her. She played a phys ed teacher on Old Christine and now has a lead in the show Glee- the only actress in Hollywood taller than Alison Janney, she spends most of her scenes seated in her expensive chair making jokes at the expens fo Charlie or Alan and helping them to come to terms with what haunts them.
 Yes, it took us years to open our arms to Two and a half Men because at first, it appears to be arm-pit farts and network Pokys, but it is ever so much more. This is a good one for everyone and even more so for any man who has been under the control over the stronger sex.",1356652800,,9421,4.438150289017341

Naturally not the same as Charlie but how could they be? Ashton is funny but one has to understand he isn't trying to be Charlie. If they could bring Charlie back like they do on the soap operas, it would be great. But we have to adjust I guess. No need to be childish about it. It's just another one of life's disappointments.",1356566400,,477,4.085106382978723

3219256,5,B000WMA72C,My father is the one who got me started on this show.  I was visiting one day and Dad was downstairs laughing and laughing. I had to find out what was so funny.  He was watching an episode of Two and a Half Men.  I stayed and watched and became hooked.  I bought this DVD for him -- so he could have a good laugh whenever needed.,1236643200,2,329,3.8656716417910446
3219267,5,B000WMA72C,"I've kept up with the series over the past few years and recently brought the dvds out and watched through the first 4 seasons (all that are available on dvd at the time of this review) again.  Without a doubt, I think the second season is the best of the series.  I wouldn't rate any of the seasons, including the ones I've seen on TV that aren't out on disc yet, below a 3 (or a 3 and a half if that was an option), but I think this is the only season I'd give a perfect 5.  Even having seen all of these episodes three or four times, I still can't stop laughing.

If you've watched the show in syndication on CW or WGN, you've probably seen several of these episodes (the syndication tends to be the first 3 seasons at this point).  I've seen other reviews where people try and list out the best episodes of this season, but it's like trying to tell someone what the best songs on a Beatles album are:  by the time you're done listing, you'll have named about 90% of the episodes in the season.

The 3rd Disc of this season is perfect.  Charlie tries to take Alan to Vegas to ease his brother's fears of a colonoscopy but Alan's semi - OCD gets in the way.  Judith feels the need to go on vacation from her stressful life of cashing alimony checks and leaves Jake with the brothers for a full week.  Charlie and Alan each mess things up in extremely hilarious ways - based on the facial expressions alone, this might be Angus T. Jones best episode as Jake.  Charlie convinces Alan to pretend to be his gay partner to impress an Ad exec - and the ensuing relationship is brilliant, especially when their mom finds out.  Jake loses his portable game system in the coffin of one of his grandmother's ex husbands.

I still enjoy watching new Two and a Half Men on Mondays, but nothing beats this season.  The story lines aren't repetitive yet.  The dialogue is still fresh.  And for me, the most important thing is the characters aren't dumb downed yet.  Charlie is of course still a highly functional drunk, but he's not an idiot.  His one liners are still littered with interesting tidbits and cultural references.  He's not the low brow idiot the writers are quickly turning him into in later seasons.  Alan's awkwardness is still fresh and hilarious.  And as Jake, Angus Jones is the perfect age.  Like the Charlie of later seasons, the writers have decided to really dumb down Jake.  As an 11 year old in season 2, Jake is just a semi-naive kid with a lot of apathy and a few cups of bad influence.

I don't regret buying all of the seasons of the series, but if I could only keep one of them, it would be season 2.  If you caught on to the show late and haven't seen the old episodes yet, this is a great place to start (and by no means is season 1 bad, this is just better if you only want to spend the money on one.)",1235606400,4,2823,4.25140712945591

Memorable episodes include ""A Sack of Jawea,"" where Charlie - trying to help Jake's miserable academic record along - dates Jake's teacher, to disastrous results. There's also ""Last Chance to See Those Tattoos,"" where Charlie discovers a website where women gather anonymously to bash him; and ""Yes, Monsignor,"" where Charlie reunites with an old flame, Lisa, who now has a baby (played by Sheen's real-life daughter, Sam).

3219326,5,B000WMA72C,"I have enjoyed watching this series since it first came out the three main characters Charlie played by Charlie Sheen. Charlie's younger brother Alan played by Jon Cryer and Alan's son Jake played by Angus Jones. All live together in Charlie's Malibu Home. Charlie is a successful music writer for various household products writing jingles for commercials such as the famous ""Maple Loop Song"" mentioned in different episodes. Alan is estranged from his wife Judith played by Marin Hinkle. As a result Alan lives with his brother Charlie and Jake stays with his father and uncle most of the time. Watching the show is like coming home to loved ones and best friends at the same time. It is one of the best sitcoms I have ever watched it's funny and heart warming for the most part the characters are all played by seasoned actors. I cant wait for season three and hopefully many more after that. There is no real premise behind the show it just deals with a family going through the growing pains of daily existence as they see it.

3219360,1,B000WMA72C,"Honestly folks, save your cash. The show's definitely nothing special, unless you love the dull thud of jokes falling on their face, punctuated by the oddly sad beats of the always inappropriately amused laugh track. This is truly a 'comedy' for an easily amused, lowest-common-denominator type of audience. Any smart ppl that watch are doing so ironically (and shame on you for enjoying the train wreck).

About the only thing the show has going for it is some servicable acting by the guy who plays the uptight brother (Jon Cryer), but even Cryer is hampered by the fact that is character is not likable in any way.  And worse (MUCH worse, actually) the Charlie Sheen character is a boat anchor around the neck of the proceedings.

Sheen's acting range on the show consists of three facial expressions: blank, smirk, and 'Who, me?'. If Cryer's character is unlikeable, Sheen's alternates between being hate-able and utterly wooden. How this guy still gets work is beyond me... even in his big hit 'Wall Street', he displayed little emotional range, it was really Michael Douglas that made that movie.

The writing on this show is no gem either, always the obvious and crass joke, every time. *You* could write 2.5 Men, and no doubt you could write it better than the show's staff does.

Far as the DVD goes, you can put your money to far better use here on Amazon, trust me. 2.5 Men is as disposable as Charlie Sheen's sanity, and a glaring reminder (warning?) that, much like McDonald's restaurants or Britney Spear's music career, popular does not always = good.",1200960000,11,1566,4.806691449814126
3219361,2,B000WMA72C,"This show is funny, but it is with all of the wrong things. It deals with sex, sex and more sex. That is not the only thing to make jokes about. I know several other struggling comedies on TV that can't make it even though they are absolutley amazing. How I Met Your Mother or 30 Rock are amazing shows that do not base their jokes strictly off sex. (Yes, they do contain it, but it isn't shoved down your throat over and over.)",1199577600,4,428,4.107142857142857
3219362,5,B000WMA72C,"It's funny, witty, a bit sexist sometimes because it's primarily from 2 middle-aged mens' point of views. I love Charlie's charismatic yet nonchalant approach to life and how much he gets off picking on his younger, less-experienced-in-sex brother.

His brother is cool too. They're both laidback, yet his bro is by far the smarter of the two. He's divorced and overly-content with his standings. However, his wife not allowing him to move on bothers him.

All in all, 2 thumbs up!

3219363,5,B000WMA72C,"For a change, Australia is ahead of USA in this release.  I've owned this now for a little while, watched the whole season through, and watched it again.  I love it as it's one of the best tv comedy shows out there.  There are 24 episodes on these disks and this is the way they pan out.
1 - BACK OFF MARY POPPINS - Charlie's male support group includes lots of Hollywood celebrities like Sean Penn and Elvis Costello - but not Alan.
2 - ENJOY THOSE GARLIC BALLS - Alan is jealous that Judith has a new beau ... and delighted that he may be off the hook for alamony.
3 - A BAG FULL OF JAWEA - Teacher's Pet.  Trying to be a good uncle, Charlie romances the teacher who threatened to suspend Jake.
4 - GO GET MOMMY'S BRA - What is Evelyn's bra doing in the back seat of Charlies car?  The answer is ... uh...unnerving.
5 - BAD NEWS FROM THE CLINIC? - Charlies falls for a female verson of himself.  And man, does she make him look miserable.
6 - THE PRICE OF HEALTHY GUMS IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE - Is Alan a Jekyll and Hyde?  A childhood shoplifting story has him convinced there's a ""bad Alan"" inside.
7 - A KOSHER SLAUGHTERHOUSE OUT IN FONTANA - Charlie and Alan's party for Evelyn turns into an affair to remember... for al the wrong reasons.
8 - FRANKENSTEIN AND THE HORNY VILLAGERS - Confusing love and lust, Alan promptly proposes when he dates a woman who's sexually adventurous.
9 - YES, MONSIGNOR - Charlie's old flame Lisa has everything: beauty, wit, intelligence, charm ... and a brand-new baby.
10- THE SALMON UNDER MY SWEATER - Right 'toon, wrong tune.  Jake hates Charlie's theme song for the TV version of his favourite comice book.
11- LAST CHANCE TO SEE THOSE TATTOOS - What a tangled worldwide web we weave.  Charlie discovers he's the subject of an unflattering website.
12- A LUNGFUL OF ALAN - A homely girl Charlie and Alan knew in high school visits - and the boys are in for a surprise.
13 - ZEJDZ Z MOICH WLOSOW (GET OFF MY HAIR) - First an earthquake, then a real disaster: With her house quake damaged, Judith moves into Charlie's beach pad.
14- THOSE BIG PINK THINGS WITH COCONUT - Aland tells Evelyn she's no longer welcome at the house.  But his mother is, as always, a step ahead of him.
15- SMELL THE UMBRELLA STAND - Vegas, baby!  Charlie's attempts to leave for Las Vegas keep coming up snake eyes.
16- CAN YOU EAT HUMAN FLESH WITH WOODEN TEETH? - Faced with a sudden IRS audit, Alan needs someone reliable to take care of Jake.  Someone like ... Charlie?
17- WOO-HOO, A HERNIA EXAM! - Back attack.  When Charlie injures his back, he refuses chiropractic help from Alan.
18- IT WAS ""MAME,"" MOM - Charlie wants to make a good impression at a gay ad exec's party.  So he asks Alan to be his 'date'.
19- A LOW GUTTURAL TONGUE-FLAPPING NOISE - Second best?  Alan is attracted to a beautiful woman who once had a fling with Charlie.
20- I ALWAYS WANTED A SHAVED MONKEY - Angry at the women in their lives, Charlie and Alan do the mature thing.  They turn on each other.
21- A SYMPATHETIC CROTCH TO CRY ON -  The death of Evelyn's second husband Harry, affects everyone in the family differently.
22- THAT OLD HOSE BAG IS MY MOTHER -  He's traded his sould for a Porsche.  That's what Charlie thinks when Alan accepts a car loan from Evelyn.
23- SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB - Bad parenting?  The guys are wracked with guilt after leaving Jake with Evelyn for an evening.
24- DOES THIS SMELL FUNNY TO YOU? -Poetic license.  Jake's ""How I Spent My Weekend"" report differs somewhat from reality.

This show is so hilarious.  Charlie Sheen does a fantastic job of delivering his lines with perfect comic timing and all the cast members are funny too.  Holland Taylor as Evelyn is one of the best, and this show doesn't slow down.  it's no wonder they're always nominated for awards.  I can't wait to see and own the third season.
