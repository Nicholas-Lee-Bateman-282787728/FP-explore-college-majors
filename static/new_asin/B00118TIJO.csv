8241026,4,B00118TIJO,"My sister (age 12) loves to dance along to this!  She's a huge PureNRG fan and didn't know they had a dance DVD.  She wishes there were more songs, but she says there's 4 songs to dance to and then 4 more with the sing-a-long.  It gives her a good reason to get up and move.  For the money I paid, I feel like it was a steal.  Add in the free super shipping and I got it for less than $2 and I know she's getting way more out of it than that.",1361232000,,442,3.6595744680851063
