8516759,5,B007HOA7F0,"Most of the movies on this five-disc set follow the standard ""jungle girl"" template - white guy in Africa comes across a white girl, possibly worshipped by the natives as a goddess, possibly with some animal friends.

Disc 1 - The Savage Girl (b&w, 1932) has Walter Byron leading an expedition to catch animals for a zoo and encountering jungle girl Rochelle Hudson. It's amusing enough, with Harry Myers as the perpetually drunk expedition financier earning the most laughs. Jungle Bride (b&w, 1933) isn't a traditional jungle girl story. Anita Page stars as a shipwreck survivor on a desert island; another, played by Charles Starrett, is the man she believes committed the murder her brother is serving time for. This is a ""pre-code"" film, and one can't help but wonder how Hollywood would have developed if they had been allowed to continue exploring these kinds of interesting sexual and emotional subtexts. This disc also has ""Jungle Rarities,"" a collection of short films, mostly of burlesque dancers with jungle girl outfits. It has some nudity, and inexplicably ends with a nuclear explosion.

Disc 2 - Queen of the Jungle (b&w, 1935) - A twelve-episode serial with a traditional jungle girl story, starring Mary Kornman of ""Our Gang"" and Reed Howes (of many, many westerns). It's entertaining, but at close to three hours it starts to drag towards the end.

Disc 3 - Jungle Siren (b&w, 1942) has Ann Corio and Buster Crabbe (from the Flash Gordon serials) fighting Nazis in the Congo. Stripper Corio looks great in her skimpy outfit, and with her bow and arrows she's one of the more effective heroines in the collection. The sound quality isn't great, though Jess Lee Brooks (as the villainous chief) has a resonant, James Earl Jones-esque voice that almost rescues that aspect. Crabbe shows up again (can you blame him?) in Nabonga (b&w, 1944), and even some of the sets are recycled from Jungle Siren. This time the heroine is Julie London, who brings an impressive self-assuredness to her first film role; it doesn't surprise me she was able to sustain an acting career in addition to her prolific singing. (She would star in the TV series ""Emergency!"" in the 70s.) She also looks incredible, though sadly she doesn't wear the standard jungle girl costume (more of a cocktail dress). Throw in some moral complexity, a surprising number of deaths, and a prominent sympathetic black character played by Prince Modupe and you have perhaps my favorite in the set. Blonde Savage (b&w, 1947) is kind of a ""noir in the jungle,"" with lots of reversals and snappy dialogue. Leif Erickson plays the hero, with singer Gayle Sherwood as the jungle girl. She's pretty but not especially memorable compared to femme fatale Veda Ann Borg, who gets a lot of the best lines. (""It was nice meeting you, ma'am!"" ""I wasn't aware we HAD met!"")

Disc 4 - Queen of the Amazons (b&w, 1947) has Patricia Morison (better than the material, the story of her film career) leading a group (including Robert Lowery and J. Edward Bromberg) into the jungle to rescue her fianc, who's been kidnapped by a tribe of jungle girls... or has he? The movie has so much stock footage it seems to have dictated the story (it begins in India for no other reason), but some of it is pretty remarkable stuff, including what looks like authentic footage of a Maasai lion hunt. Unfortunately Morison only lets her remarkable hair down at the very end. Prehistoric Women (color, 1950) stars Laurette Luez as the leader of a tribe of cavewomen who capture some men to be their husbands. It's not great; the nighttime scenes are DARK, and there's little dialogue (just a ton of narrated exposition, which gets old). And cavewomen are NOT jungle girls. Bowanga Bowanga (b&w, 1951) has a tribe of jungle girls led by Dana Wilson who kidnap some modern hunters. There's a lot of stock footage inserted seemingly at random, resulting in a pretty erratic story. Luckily this movie ramps up the sex appeal; we're fully into leopard-print bikini territory here.

Disc 5 - Liane, Jungle Goddess (color, 1956) is a semi-infamous German film starring Marion Michael (then sixteen) as a topless jungle girl. Her hair usually, but not always, covers her, and there's some tribal nudity too. There are a few jumps due to missing footage, and only about half the movie takes place in the jungle. Wild Women of Wongo (color, 1958) gives us a tribe of ugly men and beautiful women (including a drop dead gorgeous redhead whose name I was sadly unable to discover), a tribe of handsome men and ugly women, and a tribe of ""ape men"" who cause some problems. It's all pretty ridiculous, but good for a few laughs. Some of it was filmed at the Coral Castle in Florida. Finally there's Virgin Sacrifice (color, 1959), which isn't at all a jungle girl movie. A modern girl is kidnapped by Guatemalan natives and a hunter sets out to rescue her, which is the extent of the story. It's not much of a movie, despite a lot of on-location shooting. There is a little nudity.

It's too bad the collection ends on a downturn, but there are some entertaining movies here, especially Jungle Bride and all three on the third disc. For roughly sixteen hours of entertainment you could do a lot worse.",1400025600,4,5231,4.780973451327434

8516762,4,B007HOA7F0,"As a fan of old movies, and especially ""hokey"" old movies, I find a childlike pleasure in movies that were made to fill in space between the better rated movies of the day.  These movies, which go from the 40's to the 50's, were specifically just that.  Filler movies.  Remember when we could go to the movie house and watch two or three movies and not be evicted after the main attraction?  This collection is from the era when we would sneak up into the balcony and smoke a cigarette.  Most are predictable, a couple of breast shots (which made the whole movie for a young teenager), and lot's of wild animal wrestling that no doubt were done by very tame animals.  But, still, great stuff after a busy day when one just wants to sit down and relax for a while and forget the idiot's they have to deal with during the usual work day.  And, Buster Crabbe could also act.  Sip a Crown Royal and enjoy.",1205366400,10,901,4.321428571428571
