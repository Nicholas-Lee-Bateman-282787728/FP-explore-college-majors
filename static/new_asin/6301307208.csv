325904,1,6301307208,Wow the quality of this DVD is the worst I've ever seen. It's worse than VHS quality. I hear there is a Japanese Blu-Ray out there that buyers should look to instead. I'm actually streaming that HD version now and this DVD is going in the garbage.

325909,1,6301307208,"DEEP STAR SIX released in 1983
a very underated sean s cunningham classic which i enjoyed watching, lots of suspense Good acting
U.S LIONSGATE have released it on dvd but only in 1:33:1 full screen and tragically no extras except for the Theatrical trailer
the U.K. Momentum take one dvd release is much better dvd version to get
it's the only dvd version that has the film in 2:35:1 widescreen plus also has some extras aswell
the picture quality looks very Good in 2:35:1 much more clearer than the Lionsgate dvd
the sound quality is only Dolby stereo
EXTRAS
has an audio commentary with Sean cunningham which is worth listening to sean talks about the making of the etc
plus also has small behind the scenes featurette recorded back in 1982 when the film was made
also has behind the scenes special effects footage of the sea monster
and the usual Theatrical trailer
the U.K. DVD is region 2 locked so you'll need all regions player but definitely worth the money getting if you want all the extras
amazon uk don't have it listed anymore only 3rd part sellers have copies listed, so try ebay.co.uk lots of listings
1 star for the U.S. DVD, about 4stars for the U.K. DVD based on widescreen ratio & some extras",1495065600,,1212,4.589861751152074
325910,3,6301307208,"While James Cameron's epic The Abyss and, to a lesser extent, Leviathan starring Robocop get more attention, Deep Star Six is the little underwater Alien ripoff that could.  Directed by Sean S. Cunningham of Friday the 13th fame and featuring the late, great Miguel Ferrer, also of Robocop fame, Deep Star Six is a competently made film with pedestrian aspirations. It's the kind of film you turn your brain off for. It does however do a good job of reminding you just how forbidding of an existence it would be to live 2 miles down on the ocean floor. In fact, Deep Star Six features more deaths due to the environment and human error than to the monster itself. This DVD release is poor, with a 4:3 aspect ratio and a transfer that looks like it could have been sourced from an S-video, VHS transfer. Get the Japanese Blu-Ray for cheap, if you can.",1491436800,4,850,4.51948051948052

Good looking print also has no subtitles . The acting and excitement , fun and adventure of it all makes for a pretty satisfying experience though . The creature and gore are wisely back end loaded into the third reel and i quite liked them once they made-the-scene .

326010,2,6301307208,"Despite a very solid cast and some fairly good production values, DeepStar Six sinks under the weight of it own inertia. This is an extremely uneventful film, and though ostensibly a monster movie there is almost no monster action whatsoever until the final twenty minutes or so, and even then what we get is extremely lackluster thanks to some very poor special effects. The script presumably aims to build tension gradually and spends a lot of time focusing on the ensemble cast (with a little extra emphasis on our heroine, played by Nancy Everhard), but while this may sound like a good idea in theory, in practice it fails utterly, as even a character-driven story needs a certain amount of drama and tension, which DeepStar Six totally lacks. As a result, I zoned out at numerous points in the tedious plot line and found myself strongly considering the stop button more than once...but I persevered in the vain hope that at some point a monster would rear itself from the mysterious depths and serious havoc would ensue. Never happened, as even when the sea monster that is our villain finally awkwardly asserts itself, the resultant action is poorly executed and the creature effects are inferior to similar designs from the 1950s. Some quality performances from a respectable cast that tries hard are unfortunately wasted, and while the aforementioned Everhard does a good job as our likable but underdeveloped heroine, the best performance probably comes from Miguel Ferrer as a burn-out victim whose sanity is slowly slipping away from him after six months of arduous underwater duty. It wouldn't have taken a whole lot for DeepStar Six to have been a solid b-movie, or maybe even a little more than that, if only the script and direction had made action a higher priority and perhaps developed a couple of the key characters a bit better. But as it stands, DeepStar Six is simply monotonous and underwhelming in the extreme.",1437955200,,1936,4.905487804878049

Written by Arthur J. Lamb and composed by Henry W. Petrie in 1897

A crew is setting up an underwater missile site. They are in a hury to meet a deadline and naturally cut a few corners that may come back and bite them.

I knew then it was probably awful, and it couldn't compete with ""Aliens"", my all time favorite.  I watched it today on Amazon Prime just for the heck of it - 26 years later.  God, it was horrifying, and I'm still shaking my head.  The acting was atrocious - no one seemed interested in their parts. Midway through, I was hoping the underwater cheesy fish monster would chew them all up and spit them out.  Ugh !  What a waste, and to think Miguel Ferrer is in this movie, playing a complete cowardly jerk. It wasn't even cheesy fun.  I was glad when it was over.

326060,4,6301307208,"I remember seeing this film in the theater, and it came out the same year as some other, bigger production value, underwater horror films hit the big screen (""Leviathan"" & ""The Abyss""), and despite it's low budget (or maybe because of it?) this was my favorite. Revisiting this film today, it's still a really fun creature feature populated with a bunch of ""hey...it's that guy"" character actors and actresses.

A group of scientists, military and construction crew are stationed deep underwater in an experimental deep water colony. Their mission to test the deep sea structure, as well as secure several atomic missiles on an deep sea launching platform. Before securing the launch platform, the crew must fill in a cavern below the construction site by collapsing the seafloor. The cavern is much bigger than expected and when they set off the charge, it wakes something up which has been living in the cavern.

If you are looking for just 90 minutes of turn-off-your-brain fun, then you will love this movie. Some chills and thrills sprinkled here and there, and overall just a fun little movie. I also love the practical F/X here, the model work looks great and the creature when finally revealed is pretty impressive.

The characters make irrational, illogical, poor decisions throughout the film. Nothing really makes sense. The character development is terrible and you don't really care whenever someone dies. But I do have to say that for the time, the special effects on the monster in the film are pretty good. No CGI here, just good old school special effects. For it's time they are quite good. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the nostalgic connection I had with this movie and the respect for the special effects.

326305,4,6301307208,"Due to the hype of James Cameron's blockbuster ""The Abyss"" in 1989, there was a glut of underwater sci-fi/horror thrillers, all lesser productions (not that ""The Abyss"" was a great movie, just that it was a top level production).

""Deepstar Six"" is essentially an underwater version of ""Alien"" and Star Trek, but not as good. The story revolves around A crew of underwater workers/scientists who accidentally breach a cavern and disturb the creature living there. Havoc ensues. The film was directed by Sean S. Cunningham, known for 1980's ""Friday the 13th"" and 1983's ""Spring Break."" ""Deepstar Six"" is essentially Friday the 13th underwater, but with adults and therefore more sophistication.

Although this is a Grade B production in comparison to the Grade A ""The Abyss,"" it's not bad at all as far as actors, sets and F/X go. In other words, the sets are convincing, the no-name actors do a quality job and the special effects are effective. The monster is pretty good, it just lacks the iconic stature of the creatures in ""Alien"" and ""Aliens.""

Whereas the actors are skilled, the character development is lacking and, as such, they're relatively uninteresting people and therefore largely fail to apprehend the viewer's sympathy. Don't get me wrong, there's only one whiny loser in the bunch, but the rest of 'em come off too bland. Nia Peeples is the best, but probably only because she's such a petite babe, who's inexplicably removed prematurely; stupid! Still, there's just barely enough of her.

The first half is relatively ho-hum as the characters are introduced and the underwater setting is established, but the second half won me over to some degree. There's a great scene of someone dying because he or she failed to properly decompress; and the ending, although clichd, is effective. So, overall it's pretty mediocre, but just good enough to check out.

The film runs 105 minutes.

The image quality is not very good, although I'm not sure what could've been done about that. Technology has changed since 1988. :) The characters aren't bad, and there is tension building in places. (But I never hid my face!) The most impressive part of this movie is all the props. Inside the DeepStar Six, a team of explorers is working to build a Navy base on the ocean floor. They have a smaller base located near the edge of a trench, and a submersible to travel between the bases. The inside of this equipment looks realistic as far as I can tell, and it probably cost quite a bit. I remembered 2 scenes from 25 years ago: the shower scene where Scarpelli (Nia Peeples) runs out of water and gets assistance from a ""friend,"" and the escape pod decompression scene. My favorite character is Collins (played by Nancy Everhard), who is supposed to be the first woman to graduate from the Navy SEALS. (Alright!)  I thought the monster was scary enough, although his/her big eyes were kind of cute and probably wouldn't be found on a creature that lives in a deep sea cave without light. And what about the shotguns in the station? I don't think anyone would keep big guns in a pressurized underwater station for fear of breaching the hull.

The show tries to be realistic too in a successful way.  For instance, a person can truly collapse from not equalizing his inner body pressure with the outside sea pressure.  They used this subject effectively in the movie.  Anyway the movie is presented as suspenseful although with a ray of hope for the crew's survival like many good edge-of-your-seat flicks.  It features as one of the crew members Snyder, played by Miguel Ferrer, who seems to be disturbed and almost neurotic.  He causes mishaps which leads the crew members to compounded disaster after the monster is known to be lurking somewhere around.  There is a violent death of just about everyone and their alternative actions for safety slowly get used up.  It seems like the antithesis to the crew's survival in the movie belongs to Snyder and his lack of caution as the real detriment to the sea mission.  This is an interesting way to present the actual monster problem.  I did think some of the scenery underwater was real pretty and effective for the movie.

326344,1,6301307208,"For some reason, the late 1980s had a LOT of underwater horror movies. Naturally, a few are going to be brilliant... and most of them will be bad.

""Deep Star Six"" is one of the latter. It's a movie that seems to think ""Hey! We have a giant crab puppet and lots of fake blood, so we don't need a plot or likable characters!"", and proceeds to structure itself accordingly. Most of the deaths aren't even due to the monster, which renders the bland characters' deaths hilarious instead of tragic or even shocking.

Deep Star Six is a deep ocean outpost tasked with setting up an underwater missile silo and/or investigating scientific phenomena. When they discover a prehistoric cave at the designated location, the crew blast it open and send down a mini-sub to investigate... only to have it vanish without a trace. Then a giant crustacean bursts into the station and starts killing people.

Well, you know the drill in this sort of story. After a few more fatalities, the crew decides to abandon the station, but since DeepStar Six is apparently made out of glass and chewing hum, it's falling apart. Unless they can fix it somehow, they'll either be eaten alive or blown up when the nuclear reactor goes supercritical.

If you're looking for a good horror movie, ""Deep Star Six"" is not for you. This movie is best enjoyed as a comedy -- the acting is hammy, the station is hilariously fragile (""Oh no! A giant crab has invaded! NUCLEAR EXPLOSION!""), and the crew constantly dying due to their own ineptitude. That's right: at least half the deaths are due to the crew's stupidity instead of the giant crab-Muppet.

That also sucks a lot of the supposed tension out of the movie -- we know that several of these people would be alive if they weren't complete idiots, so all the gory, graphic deaths become funny. The final third of the movie devolves into total farce, with random bodily explosions and hallucinations of dead people.

Director Sean S. Cunningham also falls down on trying to evoke any sense of horror, even in scenes where it would be painfully easy -- such as when the crew has to creep into a flooded chamber where the monster is lurking. Do we get any tension, any creepiness? No, we just get a few flat minutes of bickering, followed by some more gory deaths.

The characters aren't much to write home about either -- either they're bland or cartoonish, and none of them really have any distinguishing characteristics. The only exception is Nancy Everhard's Joyce, mainly because she's a HORRIBLE PERSON. Why? At one point, we find out that Joyce is pregnant. Yes, she took her unborn baby on a dangerous undersea mission... and as the icing on the cake, she didn't plan to tell her lover that he was going to be a dad. What a likable person.

And what does the pregnancy add to the story? Nothing except two minutes of padding. It's mentioned once, and then dropped completely.

""Deep Star Six"" is a waterlogged mess that is best appreciated as a comedy. If you try to take it seriously, it might make you want to drown yourself with boredom.",1361750400,2,3065,4.6402214022140225

326347,3,6301307208,"Better acting but a lower budget than Leviathan (1989), and it blaringly shows.  Monster movie fans should stick to Leviathan, but all in all this shouldn't be too disappointing.

Deep Star Six follows several scientists and NAVY crew setting up a deep sea missile silo.  They find that their missile platform site is on top of a large cavern system which Scarpelli (Nia Peeples; Werewolf: The Beast Among Us) is dying to investigate for new deep sea marine species.  However, Captain Phillip (Taurean Blacque; Rocky II) and crew won't have it and they instead detonate the caverns to somehow ""secure"" the site and send down a probe to take video and photos of a cavern separated from the rest of the ocean for upwards of millions of years.  They lose the probe and send a small transport to recover it.  This does not go well.  They get attacked by ""something"" in the cavern and contact is lost--presumably they're dead.

No sign of the monster yet in this low budget flick, just a lot of creature POV shots as it swims about.  It must be sizable because it wastes no time saying ""hi"" to the Star Six crew by ramming the crap out of their vessel causing considerable damage.  Additional powerful checks to the facility nearly push it into the deep chasm they created.

Because this is largely written around the characters, who rarely encounter the creature, this feels more like a disaster movie in which things are just ""happening around the characters"" instead of a monster movie where the creature ""does things to the characters.""  So any suspense is character-driven as viewers are given little to fear in terms of this mysterious creature, which seems to respond to the facility's lights aggressively.  When we do see the monster it's pretty cool-looking though.  Really.

From the movie's start, this sea monster seemed very large and extremely fast since it could ram the deep sea station and move it!  It had more effect on that station than I would on a SmartCar with a dedicated tackle.  However, when we finally meet are deep sea foe we see that this giant crocodile-lobster with sort of a Tremors' mouth couldn't weigh more than 5000 pounds (if not less?) and appears incapable of swimming faster than, say, maybe 15-25 mph--this thing is no sleek shark.  Big?  Sure.  Big enough to push a sea station the size of a large house into a chasm?  NO WAY!!!

Shots of the station and ocean exterior are thoroughly unimpressive, but hardly matter for one's enjoyment of this movie.  Its budgetary wounds are stitched by credible dialogue and, for the nature of the movie, effective acting by a cast representing a solid range of characters.  Dr. Norris (Cindy Picket; Sleepwalkers), the medical officer, is most affected by the loss of a crewman.  And when the captain suffers a fatal injury Joyce (Nancy Everhard; Urban Legends: Bloody Mary) and McBride (Greg Evigan; Tek War) are forced to assume leadership roles.  Jim (Matt McCoy; The Hand That Rocks the Cradle), Scarpelli's boyfriend, provides the comic relief.

Snyder (Miguel Ferrer; RoboCop, Tales from the Crypt, The Stand), the whiny high-strung tech on board, already wanted to be home since his four-month tour had already been extended.  This fool detonates their missile a little too close to the station.  This does not go well.  This is his first in a series of major screw-ups including accidently killing a crewman with some weird air-pumping harpoon and getting himself killed in via decompression.

The cast is widdled down to a few who find a way to kill the aberration.  Or did they?",1358553600,,3564,4.83003300330033

326369,4,6301307208,"This movie does not have the budget that James Cameron had for The Abyss, or even Leviathan, but it is still one of the most effective underwater monster movies I have ever seen.  Why?  It started with a strong script, with strong characters, and it built the film around those characters, instead of around the creature or special effects they didn't have the budget to pull off.

Deep StarSix is the story of several scientists and members of the NAVY setting up a secret underwater missile silo.  While doing this they come in contact with a creature that wants nothing more than to turn the crew of the DeepStar Six into lunch.

A simple plot executed with with pure talent.  The monster only makes a few appearances, and yet the suspense in this one is thick, using character's paranoia and fear to build the tension.  There is also a good amount of messy violence for fans of the of the splatter, but not so much to drive away the average big monster fan.

To sum it up, this isn't an amazing film, but for what it is, it is top notch, and proves that insane effects shots are not needed to create an exciting giant monster movie.  SyFy take note!",1279497600,,1153,4.4523809523809526
326370,4,6301307208,"Although some of the special effects have not aged too well, DeepStar Six (1989) is a still a solidly entertaining sea monster movie, that unfolds like classic science fiction from the 50's, as an unknown creature is released from an undersea cavern.  Directed by Sean S. Cunningham (Friday The 13th, A Stranger Is Watching), and co-executive produced by Mario Kassar (Terminator 2, Cliffhanger), the film has pretty good production values.

DeepStar Six is a government run underwater facility, whose unlikely task is to locate a suitable site for a missile platform.  The craft Seacat is ordered by to set off an explosive charge to prepare a prospective site for use.  The explosion releases an unknown creature, from a cavern below.  The creature is attracted to light, and extremely fast, and quickly takes out Seacat.  The remote station Seatrack is the next victim, and is in danger of falling off a shelf, after being struck repeatedly by the creature.  Mini-sub DSRV2 links up to Seatrack, and manages to rescue survivors, just before it topples from the shelf.  Returning to DeepStar Six, the remaining crew regroups and is preparing to depart for the surface, when yet another catastrophe strikes, and they finally come face to face with the monster.

There are some far- fetched aspects, but the overall story holds together fairly well, and moves along briskly.  One result of keeping the monster so completely under wraps, is that DeepStar Six seems more like a disaster movie, where bad things just keep happening, rather than a true monster movie.  There isn't anything solid for the audience to fear, so is difficult for any level of suspense to build up.

The underwater exteriors and shots featuring models, probably weren't that impressive when the film was originally released, and now looking severely dated, are something of a distraction.  Fortunately the interior sets are more modern and realistic, although the design of the underwater facilities are extremely prone to flash flooding.  When the monster finally appears, it looks like something from an Irwin Allen production.  Ugly, and not too mobile, it's hard to imagine that this creature is capable of great speed.  The film seems to make the most out of the beast's brief appearances.

The cast may not have any big stars, but even those in minor roles do a very good job here.  We get a quick impression of the characters in everyday life, before they are plunged into crisis.  Their interaction and the dialog seems mostly believable, and not too clichd.  Captain Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) is in charge of the operation, Dr. Van Gelder (Marius Weyers) the expert on underwater facilities and missile, and Dr. Norris (Cindy Pickett) the medical officer.  Also in the crew are Scarpelli (Nia Peeples), Jim Richardson (Matt McCoy), Snyder (Miguel Ferrer), Burciaga (Elya Baskin), McBride (Greg Evigan) and Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard).

Greg Evigan, is still mostly known for the TV series BJ and the Bear, is pretty good here as McBride, one of the crew forced to assume leadership.  McBride is romantically involved with Joyce Collins, who similarly has to step it up.  Nia Peeples as Scarpelli, provides words of caution and background information, before the disaster strikes.  When put to the test, the crew functions and adapts fairly well under pressure (with one exception).  Miguel Ferrer steals much of the spotlight as Snyder, a tech in a key position, who gradually falls completely apart.  Between setting off an explosion that critically damages the station, to accidentally killing a colleague, to totally freaking out, it is just a really bad day for Snyder.

Although some of the special effects are weak, and the logic flawed, DeepStar Six is still a pretty entertaining undersea adventure.  The monster isn't a major visual factor until near the end, but the tightly written script, and crisply executed action sequences, keeps things interesting until you get there.",1278979200,,3971,5.103715170278638

326376,3,6301307208,"Deep Star Six: VHS Movie Review

Grade: C+

O.K., so in the age of DVD's, I buried this out of my VHS collection, and remembered one scene (the infamous decompression scene). Remembering watching it about 5 years ago, decided to give it another try. I now know why I didn't remember much of it though; most of the movie is pretty much forgetable.

The plot, yet another shameless ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-20th-Anniversary-Edition-Award-Series/dp/B00000ILDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien: 20th Anniversary Edition [Award Series</a>]"" rip-off, this time tries to put Alien underwater, disturbed from his sleep (hibernaton?) by a crew of explorers trying to set up a Navy Base on the bottom of the ocean floor. It gets mad, and starts (just like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Uncut-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001K9OXDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th Uncut (Deluxe Edition)</a>, another movie Sean S. Cunningham directed) picking off the crew one by one.

But the sad thing: you just about never see the monster. (Although when you do see it, I rather liked the way it looked, despite it being a rubber suit) Instead, the movie focuses more on character development, developing useless characters that just die later on in the movie, when the monster (finally) shows up.

Along with a ton of character development, there are numourous underwater shots, but its too dark to see anything clearly. Basically, nothing really goes on for the first hour of the movie, and you don't even see the monster until the movie only has about half an hour left. (And it's only actually on screen for a total of about a minute.)

Yet there was one thing that really surprised me: the casting. The actors and actresses were chosen extremly well, and they all play their parts like they really were trapped underwater with a giant angry lobster/crab thing.

So in the end the acting saves the movie from being a total disaster, and there are some cool scenes. (Once again, the decommpression scene.) The first of 1989's ""underwater thriller"" era (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Abyss-Special-Edition/dp/B00005V9IL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Abyss (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leviathan/dp/0792839684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leviathan</a>&nbsp;are the other ones) Deep Star Six still manages to pack a punch, even on VHS.",1242432000,6,2545,6.295977011494253
326377,3,6301307208,Sorry for the stupid title but I find it hard to come up with something short and original for every review. This is one great low budget underwater film and I`ve found it even better than the similar themed Leviathan. You can`t compare it to The Abyss because that`s a whole different kind of mosnter. The is movie is fun (which film who has Miguel Ferrer on the cast isn`t?) has some nice splatter effects (decompression) and the cast is doing it`s best to create likeable characters and keep a straight face in all the mayhem.,1237334400,2,529,4.520833333333333
326378,3,6301307208,"I saw this one in the theater back in the day(my most vivid memory is that I really had to pee and I was happy when the film ended so I could dart off to the restroom).  I wasn't crazy about it then, and I'm still not today.  It's a pity coz the right ingredients are here.  You got an underwater crew menaced by a prehistoric beasty(on an adequate budget) directed by Sean Cunningham.  Sounds like fun, right?
Well, for a monster movie, there is a surprising lack of monster action.  Most of the film it seems like endless scenes of folks sitting in cockpits/control rooms, water bursting from walls, people bickering, people shouting stuff like, ""Close the hatches!"", and endlessly repairing damage(or attempting to).  When the monster shows up, you're already kinda tired of the whole thing.  It doesn't look quite as bad as others have said(it's wisely kept in the dark most of the time), but it's not terribly impressive.
On the positive side, those of you who couldn't get enough of Greg Evigan in My Two Dads will have a splendid time watching him as a hero in a full length film!  And using the F word!  Also along for the ride are Matt Mccoy, Miguel Ferrer, and Ferris Buhler's mom.  Ferrer is Deep Star Six's version of Michael Biehn's character in The Abyss.
Deep Star Six has a few good bloody moments, and even fewer suspense moments, but it's not a total throwaway I guess.",1223078400,,1387,4.534136546184739
326379,2,6301307208,"Besides being a cheesy movie, although it has Miguel Ferrer, son of legendary screen star Jose Ferrer at the helm, I did buy it just to complete my trilogy of underwater Sci-Fi thriller movies (The Abyss*****, Leviathan*** and Deep Star Six**).

Not much to say here, except that it is a shame we still get dished up movies on DVD in the full screen version.
While I can still understand it for a movie in a ratio 1.66:1, where the cropping of the image would be minimal if at all, for a movie filmed in 1.85:1, 2.35:1 and up it is simply unforgivable.

Mostly movies by Universal are dished up like this (see the recent release of ""Colossus - The Forbin Project"", or even a splendid movie like ""Iceman"" starring Timothy Hutton and John Lone).

Also a shame are all those movies send to the market in mono, when they were originally released in Stereo Surround sound in theaters (see MGM/UA's release of ""Meteor"", starring Sean Connery and Natalie Wood and ""Midway"" starring Robert Mitchum and Glenn Ford).

This simply shows that the industry has absolutely no respect for their audiences, or worse, that they consider them stupid.

It is even more amazing, since all the above titles were released at one time on Laserdisc with their original soundtracks and image ratios intact.
I should know, because I own them and therefore I have living proof in my hands that ever since Laserdiscs have been discontinued in favor of DVDs, the industry has made steps backward instead of ahead as the technology proves.

Yet they allow themselves the luxury to play games with us, instead of practicing what they always preach: excellence.
Some Hollywood dinosaurs should really die off if they cannot prove they still can maintain a bit of decency and honesty of the trade.

It is not enough to make a quick buck, my dears.
You need to really get back to work if you want to stay alive...
This is truly my honest suggestion to the industry, if they really want to go on producing movies.

For the DVD quality, there is little to be said. A bit better than the VHS version, at least in the title section, but still, being in Full Screen one has a difficulty to keep focus throughout the action scenes, since everything is framed at 1.33:1, hence confused for this sort of movie.

Not recommended at all.

When you put together the thought of being crushed by the weight of the ocean, of not decompressing while racing to the surface to escape a nightmare, its freaky folks.

""Deepstar Six"" is an excellent example of how the 1979 classic ""Alien"" was a mistake in some ways--not because it was a poor film or that it was not well-made--but it set the standard so high for creature-features that anything that does not deliver such suspense, terror, and thrills is seen as a disappointment.  This 1988 rehash is the same formula ad nausea and does not provide many scares or believable characters.
Far below the surface of the unforgiving sea, the crew of the Deepstar Six submarine are explorers in a world of darkness and unimaginable pressure.  All they want is to get home safely and see their families.  Their mission is to establish a top secret naval base on the ocean's floor, but an alien-esque creature is making that task not only difficult, but deadly.  The special effects are fairly humorous, the performances of the has-been soap opera cast are only adequate, and the script is poor.  Director Sean S. Cunningham (""Friday the 13th"") saves this picture from being a laughing howl in the wind, using some unique camera angles and articulate cinematography, but unfortunately does not have the support or the screenplay to produce an effective horror film.  Fans of the genre will be satisfied, but those looking for a stylish, scary monster movie should stick with ""Aliens"".

326425,2,6301307208,This movie is a copy of such films as Leviathan and The Abyss. It is entertaining but lacks the true suspense and quality effects found in The Abyss. I was greatly disappointed that this is not presented in wide screen format but rather formatted for TV. If you want to watch a movie that has the made for TV feel then this is OK But if you want a good viewing experience watch The Abyss.,995328000,3,388,4.1866666666666665
326426,3,6301307208,"Deep Star Six is a fun monster movie. I am really surprised that it got a DVD release. Too bad the DVD is not up to the high standard. Full screen only, no subtitling option, no Dolby 5.1 but the picture quality is OK better than the old image entertainment LD. The story is about an underwater research facility attacked by a giant sea monster. Nothing special about the story and the special effects also not very good but is has enough suspence for this genre. Worth a look.",990316800,27,477,4.370786516853933
326427,3,6301307208,"The story begins in an underwater facility, roughly two miles beneath the ocean. Not far from the facility, and the small crew operating it, a monstrous crab-like creature resides undisturbed in its cave, but when some missels from the facility are unintentionally launched into the ocean and detonated, the angry creature is forced from its home and is out for blood! Needless to say chaos follows, and the creature eventually finds its way into the very facility responsible for the launch!
I don't want to give away what happens after that, but aside from this movie's obvious low-budget, it does deliver some pretty good thrills, and humerous moments, though the humerous ones were probably unintentional.
All in all, I'd say Deepstar Six is worth a look at on a rainy day, or if there's nothing better on t.v. This DVD looks no better than vhs, it comes with no extra features, and its in fullscreen! So there isn't really any reason to buy this one. I'd sooner buy Leviathan, which is a much better movie, and a nicer DVD.",982540800,3,1028,4.748603351955308
326428,3,6301307208,"This, like ""Leviathan"" released the same year, is kind of a silly knock-off of ""The Abyss"" with a touch of ""Alien"" thrown in.  The miniature effects are cheesy but earnest, and the cast seems to be having fun.  This isn't one for the library, but if it came on TV late night you'd probably enjoy it as much as any other goofy sci-fi flick.  Director Sean Cunningham has done better, and Greg Evigan hasn't appeared on the big screen since this film, I don't think, but DEEPSTAR SIX is still kinda fun in a creepy sort of way (or is it creepy in a fun sort of way?).",982454400,9,565,4.212962962962963
