7909531,5,B00000I4XQ,"The video is very informative. Its materials cover from general nutrition, folk culture medicine, to modern westen drug-drug interactions. The materials metioned in this tape are all down-to-earth, and people will  encounter them in a daily basis. Except in the drug-drug interaction  section, one of the drug they put on the show is rarely used today.
I  would recommd everyone to buy this tape, including pharmacists and medical  doctors. I use the tape to test some of my pharmacist/MD friends, they  didn't know ALL the drug-drug interactions mentioned in this tape.",961545600,2,570,5.21978021978022
