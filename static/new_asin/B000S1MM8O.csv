2879092,5,B000S1MM8O,"If you like dance-based exercise dvds, give this one a try.  My heartrate was up through the whole work out and it is really fun.  The instructor is adorable and steps are fairly easy to follow (it generally takes me a few runs through a routine to get the steps, but I was able to do most of them the first time through).  It's just what I needed to get excited about exercising again.",1189123200,6,386,4.1891891891891895
2879093,4,B000S1MM8O,"I have one negative thing to say about this video, and a number of positive remarks, so I'll begin with the negative: the Gypsy Clark's high-pitched, grainy voice kind of drives me nuts. Now, after forty minutes of hearing it and having endorphins coursing through my body, I no longer had a nails-on-chalkboard reaction to it, but oh were the first ten minutes ever hard.

Now for the positive: first of all, this is the first Crunch dance-based DVD I've done that actually felt like dancing. I don't know what it is about cardio-style dancing, but that cha-cha and that hip-hop never seem anywhere close to the real thing. There's something so weirdly controlled, so robotic, about cardio instructors' dance movements. It's like someone took my croissant and made it whole-grain. I'm sure it's better for me, but it tastes funny. That said, I've grown to like them, even Marie Forleo in all her strangeness. I'd rather do a fake cha cha than twenty jumping jacks. But Cardio Go-Go Dance actually feels like dancing. It's only one kind of dance for the full DVD (no medley of ""Latin heat"" or whatever), and a lot of the moves felt like what I might do naturally in a club.

What I expected even less was this: so many of the movements were bellydance movements! Chest lifts and shimmies, hip bumps and lifts, omis, and so on. The mood and the music are completely different, but I think the video would be a great way for bellydancers to do some cardio that would warm up exactly the muscles they use, but with a wholly different vibe.

Finally, I really liked the fact that the backup dancers/exercisers varied in the way they performed, or danced, the movements. In fact, some of them did the movements in a more dancey, if not as intense, way than Gypsy Clark. Watching them I got a sense of how the video could be done more as a dance warmup than as a typical cardio workout. (Though yes -- I did find that woman to her left kind of freaky too.)",1296345600,4,1950,4.534090909090909
2879094,3,B000S1MM8O,"I really wanted this DVD and tried really hard to like it. I used it several times and though it has all the right elements for me - upbeat, dance like, instructor is likeable, fast moving- I still have not really enjoyed as much as the other Crunch videos.",1285113600,,257,4.26530612244898
2879095,4,B000S1MM8O,"This is a fun workout! I thought for the price I'd try it, maybe do it as an easy workout on days I don't feel like it, but it really is a fun workout, and it got my heart rate up. With all the jumping and strutting around I felt like I worked harder than some of my other dance workouts. The instructor is fun and the people she dances with are cutesy without being over the top annoying. The moves are fun and easy to learn. I didn't realize how long the workout was when I ordered. I enjoy when you don't have to do the warmup select a section, select another section, select a cooldown. You just kind of jump in and keep going! Fun moves. Fun all around. Very enjoyable.",1236902400,,674,4.075187969924812
2879096,4,B000S1MM8O,"I purchased this dvd for my 15 year old daughter, and she seems to really like it.  It was a great price, and was received in a timely manner.",1235520000,,142,3.896551724137931
2879097,3,B000S1MM8O,"This DVD definately keeps you moving, but it is straight out of the 80's.  I'm not really in to 80's aerobics and had hoped that this DVD would be sexier.",1215475200,2,154,4.133333333333334
2879098,2,B000S1MM8O,"I get easily bored with exercise, so it's always a struggle for me to find something that I like.  I also, admittedly, am a bit on the lazy side, so if there's something I find boring, I tend to stop right away.  This video kept my attention for about 3/4 of the time.  The routines were a bit too repetitious for me.  But the real reason I had to stop was not because of the dancing itself, but because the girl in the pink pants and green top annoyed me so much.  I couldn't help but watch her.  It was like a bad accident where you couldn't tear your eyes away. Honestly, I think that if I wasn't so fixated on her, then I would have enjoyed the video a lot more.",1203292800,3,666,4.007575757575758
2879099,2,B000S1MM8O,"I'm sure this is a great DVD for more coordinated people, but it makes me feel even more clumsy than normal.  It gets my heart rate up, but is hard to follow.  I always feel like I'm a step behind.  Plus, the girls on the video are rather obnoxious (not only because they are skinny and perky).  It may be more enjoyable once I did it enough to learn all the moves, but I don't know if I will ever use it often enough for that to happen.  Overall, I would not recommend this DVD unless you are a skilled dancer/ athlete.",1202601600,2,520,4.0588235294117645
2879100,1,B000S1MM8O,"I work with my hands and develop a lot of stress in my upper body during the day. I would not do this workout if you have shoulder or neck tension on a regular basis. There are a lot of bizarre shoulder rolls, and I am in absolute agony right now.

Beyond that, I cannot stand the instructor's voice or demeanor, which is a huge consideration for videos that are meant to be watched repeatedly. I participated in the warm-up for two minutes before I had to eject the disk to escape her squeaky voice (the pain set in a few minutes later).

I like Crunch workout products in general, but this one is a dud.",1202256000,2,605,4.206896551724138
2879101,3,B000S1MM8O,"I got this DVD because I am trying to do some lower impact things to let an injury heal.  I liked that it was lower impact but it still got my heart rate up.  It was no where near as cheesy as Denise Austin's Cardio Dance and Sculpt.  However, it was not very exciting. It was fun and cute but not a real workout.  Maybe I will use it as a warm up for pilates or yoga or for days when I don't want to work out because this is better than nothing.

I think this would be great for pre-teens and teens. I know the title makes it sound a little questionable, but it really was not at all.  It was tamer than most hiphop and jazz classes I have taken.

If you are looking for a fun, cutesy dance workout or something to get you moving on days when you'd rather stay in bed, this is for you.  If you are looking for a real workout, keep looking.",1201910400,2,840,3.9
2879102,1,B000S1MM8O,"I've seen a lot of exercise videos and DVDs, and this one is is bland and boring by any standard. When you think 'go-go', you think sexy and maybe even a little naughty/racy/suggestive, but this DVD is tame enough for a church group. The choreography - what there is of it - is surprisingly uninspired. Most of it is composed of low-impact step-touches and step-crosses, those classic old standbys of 1980s aerobic dance vids. But go-go? I think not-not. A lot more of it is just standing while you slowly - almost robotically - shake your hips, thrust your pelvis, or pop your chest. You'll have to work hard to raise your heart level and keep it up for any meaningful benefit.

The music is mind-numbingly repetitive and just plain dull. The mannequins in this are almost zombie-like (except for the manic blonde on the left) and the trademark Crunch whoops and hollers appeared to be dubbed in. (And speaking of the dancers, why are the ethnic women placed far off to the sides of the group, nearly out of shot?)

The blandness even extends to the set. There isn't the slightest bit of 'go-go' ambiance in either lighting or decor. The backdrop has the traditional Crunch ""brick loft"" look with step platforms and Swiss balls piled neatly in one corner. Yawn.

For beginners, this is better than nothing, but it won't take long for them to be ready for something a little more vigorous. It's much less like those lap-dance videos by Carmen Electra and very much more like those indoor walking videos by Prevention and Denise Austin. And even those are more fun than this.",1200700800,3,1574,4.675090252707581
2879103,4,B000S1MM8O,"I haven't exercised in a long time so I found this workout very challenging.  I broke it up into three 15 minute segments to begin with.  I've never been fond of workout videos but this one was easy enough to follow, which was important to me.  The moves weren't complicated and were fun (though also a little cheesy, but that's better than boring).  I could feel it in my muscles the next day.  I think this is a good beginner's workout and it was good enough for me to put it on the next day instead of letting it sit on the shelf & collecting dust.  ;)  The only thing I would improve on is the music~ it's pretty generic.",1200528000,,625,4.158333333333333
2879104,4,B000S1MM8O,"Okay, the workout itself wasn't bad. Actually it kind of reminds me of Sweating to the Oldies workouts, except, well, no overweight people. I haven't had the chance to do the workout yet, but i watched it to see how difficult it might be for me, and well, theres a pregnant woman doing the moves, and she seemed to be having a good time, soooo.. i guess if a pregnant woman can do it without dropping dead, why cant i?

the only complaint i have, isn't about the instructor. uh-uh, its about the tall blond chick in the hot pink/lime green outfit right next to the instructor. shes distracting, and not in a good way, either...shes so over the top with her facial expressions i just want to shut off the tape or fast forward or something, but other than her, this dvd wasn't that bad at all.",1200355200,,791,4.344594594594595
2879105,4,B000S1MM8O,"For anyone looking for actual go-go moves, this doesn't really deliver.  I think ""go-go"" in the title is mainly for marketing.  As someone who really does like to go-go dance, I was disappointed this didn't offer more legit moves.  Perhaps it would have felt more go-go if the music would have gone along with that vibe, instead of goofy electronic keyboard (that you hear in the video clip above) or the Latin-esque music.

That said, this IS a good workout, and fun, and the moves are broken down to easy steps.  But the few go-go moves involved do not constitute a go-go workout.  Look up the Pontani Sisters for that!  Four stars for the great workout, though.",1200268800,2,664,4.6239316239316235
2879106,3,B000S1MM8O,"Crunch Cardio Go-Go Dance runs approximately 41 minutes with warmup and cooldown.  Instructor Gypsy Clark does a reasonably good job with cueing.  Very personable instructor, although I didn't need to hear how ""hot"" I was every few minutes!

There's some impact in this one but I found it easy to modify.  I didn't have any issues with doing this one on carpet.

There's some Go-Go type dancing in this workout, but there's also some fun 50's burlesque style dancing (think Gypsy Rose Lee) which I had fun doing.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really get the heartrate up there, but I can't elevate my heartrate with my Island Girl hula workouts either...this is just some fun dancing stuff.

The music was adequate...however, there's one section in the workout where the music didn't match the movement.  I'm guessing that Crunch couldn't get the license to the music piece they wanted and subbed another music piece in, which was a tiny bit slower tempo than what the dancers were using.  I recognized it from Crunch Cardio Salsa...it didn't really work for the dance moves in the section.  It was a little off-putting seeing the dancers one beat ahead of myself...Crunch REALLY should have fixed the music in that section before releasing the DVD.  But it's just 5 minutes out of the 41 minutes of workout, so I'll survive.

Recommend to intermediates with some dance experience.",1198540800,17,1378,4.917748917748917
2879107,3,B000S1MM8O,"Courtney Gypsy Clarke has a very upbeat & cute personality & always encouraging. She has 6 backup girls all different ethnics & one who actually doesn't have rock hard abs. They all stay perky with her & don't seem bored at all during this 40 min workout.
The moves start up mostly about shoulder rolls & shakes ala burlesque style in the warm up for 4 min, but goes quickly to go-go style, a hint of latin (salsa & cha-chas), a lot of 60s (pony), 70s disco, a touch of hip hop & the cool down had some body rolls.
You learn a move, repeat it 4-5x or more, then build up into a routine after every new move after that. There are about 4-5 different routines you learn.
All the moves are relatively easy, she broke down one or 2 moves that she thought might need it. She never goes half speed or slower. She doesn't give any body movement cues that will help you to figure it out anymore then mimicking by watching, just mostly calls out the name she gives the move.
Most of the moves were corny in my opinion, she even throws in hops for no reason other then to build up the heart rate & a couple moves just had kicking forward, I was thinking, ""What, are we doing kickboxing now?"" If it was suppose to be a hip hop move, I wouldn't know, it just looked silly. There were a few moves I did like, but only about 20% of it. After 30 min, I just stood there, FFWing until I saw a move that looked interesting & wanted to try. I like Gypsy, I liked the pace of the workout, the repetition & routine style & hope there's another dvd with more recent moves that are more sensual/fluid instead of jumpy, child-like cute.
Beginners would like this, those who like corny dances like Yoga Booty Ballet does (though I love their yoga/toning), and people who exercise somewhat regularly could use this as a light day.

2879108,2,B000S1MM8O,"I agree with the 3 stars, and I'll even go lower.  I LOVE most of the Crunch workouts - I have a bunch.  This one, though, was really disappointing.  Like another reviewer, I didn't think there was anything ""go-go"" about it - the music was something you hear at a retirement home, the women in the workout were absolutely ridiculous, and the dances were far from challenging - even the warm up didn't warm me up.  If you really want a workout stick to the Boot Camps, the Total Resculpt and the Cardio Sculpt.  I also really like the ones with Ellen Barrett which I alternate with the more challenging ones - and my latest favorite is the Bikini Body one. I didn't care for the Salsa one either.",1195603200,5,695,4.3565891472868215
2879109,5,B000S1MM8O,"When I first looked at it, I didn't expect much.  When I played it, it was this cute dance with girls just having fun shaking shoulders, hips, wrists, whole body.  Although it's a little feminine, I had a lot of fun, and the trainer, Gypsy Clark, super funny, full of energy. It's what I needed to get excited about excerse.  Now, I can't wait to do it.",1192838400,,353,4.2388059701492535
2879110,3,B000S1MM8O,"This video was okay, and this is coming from someone who loves dance based workout DVDs. It was a lot of bouncing around instead of true dancing. The instructor is easy to follow and her directions are clear enough, but I found her dancers to be a bit on the annoying side. I also didn't get what was so ""go-go"" dance about it. It jumped from jazz to hip hop to latin...didn't flow well. However, like another reviewer mentioned, the movements are sexy and feminine. I would say a person who has 2 left feet wouldn't enjoy this video too much.

It does give you a low-impact aerobic workout, but I don't think you'd magically lose 20 pounds doing this video, you'd need a more challenging video. Regardless, I worked up a sweat but I found myself a bit bored and wondering how much longer I had until the workout was over. A bit too cheesy and silly for my taste.

2879112,4,B000S1MM8O,"I enjoyed this dvd workout. If you like dance aerobics, then you will enjoy this. The steps are easy and though you work up a sweat, it's not too intense. You still get a good calorie burn.",1189728000,4,189,4.135135135135135

8204052,4,B000S1MM8O,"I read the reviews before I purchased this and felt the reviews were all over the place as to what people interpret this DVD to be, therefore I wasn't sure what to expect.
I am a moderateley experienced dancer who was looking for a DVD to give me more ideas on dance techniques, and to provide a choreographed dance routine to dance along with. I feel this DVD failed me in those aspects because it does not provide either of those qualities...to ME.
The dance moves are your very basic dance moves that you have learned if you have ever been out dancing in any club. I did not learn any new moves from this DVD.
Also, everything is broken down into step-by-step form which is great for learning how to dance the moves, but then the next routine is started so there is never a part where you actually dance along for a steady amount of time (hence missing the choreographed dance routine that I was looking for).
I get really pumped up dancing along to music, and the music is barely audible in this DVD. I think they do that so that beginners can really focus on learning the dance moves, but it bored me.
Some reviews said the girl hosting the show is corny with her ""oh yah's"" and what not, but I felt she did a great job in keeping the enthusiasm going for the routines. I also felt she did a good job at teaching the moves (even though I already knew them lol).
I give this video an A for effort~there is enthusiasm and great teaching techniques exercised. But it is a very basic, beginner dance DVD. I would call it more of an aerobic dance DVD, not a go-go DVD.",1339545600,,1568,4.282828282828283
