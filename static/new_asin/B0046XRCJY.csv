4271192,5,B0046XRCJY,"I found this show to be an extremly intense, ""Edge of Your Seat"" kind of suspence/mystery. The sort that you are not sure that you realy want to keep watching through to the end but have to. If you like shows like ""Wire in the Blood"" and ""Waking the Dead"" You should realy like this one, I did.",1306627200,4,294,4.086206896551724
4271193,3,B0046XRCJY,"DI Tom Thorne is the hero of Mark Billingham's cop novel series from London, the stereotypical dark big city loner with the hunches (as his squad rival says: why don't you try it the conventional way and search for clues and proof?) and with the problems in team work. His cases are nut cases and serial evil, and he adds to the darkness by his own behavior.
Sleepyhead was the first novel in the series and it is the first that has been turned into a TV mini series of 3 parts. We have a serial killer with medical knowledge. His victims seem to have died from heart attacks and are nearly mistaken for natural death cases. Then one victim survives, but is paralyzed. She learns to communicate by use of her eyes. She becomes a valuable witness.
This could be a very good straightforward thriller, a flirt between the DI and the treating medical doctor thrown into the bargain. That plus the cop squad rivalries would have filled a normal 90 minutes film, but for a mini-series of 3x 50 minutes, the story needs to be upgraded or stretched. What we get are flashbacks into a past case, involving a dark secret that the DI shares with the gay coroner. The new case is inexplicably linked to the old one. We have a suspenseful plot with some holes and numerous clichs.  I would have rated the film 3 stars but for the following.

SPOILER: The ethical issues involved in the story are treated in a far too cavalier fashion for my taste. We are finding ourselves, literally, in the situation that we hope the DI gets away with murder. We also follow the thought process of the paralyzed victim of the killer and we agree with her that this is not the life for a formerly active young woman. We watch the doctor turn off the machinery upon the young woman's blinked instructions (like Clint Eastwood with his girl boxer). Is it as easy as that in London?

The second miniseries on this DVD is case number two, Scaredy Cat. This is a rather violent case with two killers who commit serial crimes in a synchronized fashion. The police find one of the two killers fairly quickly. They find out that he is scared of his partner and asks for protection. Thorne decides to let him free and use him as bait (again, ethics!). Things go wrong, of course.
All in all an interesting but questionable approach to modern city life.",1296950400,6,2314,4.478672985781991

8417495,1,B0046XRCJY,"I like good thrillers and watch them often, but this story did not make any sense. The motives and actions of the serial killer were totally convoluted and senseless. It didn't make any sense even for a psychotic killer.  And there were so many gory bloody scenes that just make you want to puke. If you enjoy seeing people get their throats slashed and blood spraying everywhere, that's the show for you.",1419897600,,405,4.625
8417496,3,B0046XRCJY,"This review is for the ""Sleepyhead"" episode only. Somehow I find myself seeing a lot of mystery/thriller series as of late. Many have been outstanding. This one....not so good.

Here's the scoop. A few women have been found dead in London. All, seemingly, by the same hand using the same m.o. Police detective Tom Thorne (David Morrissey) is on the case.  They make a lot of headway fast but things stall and some clever detective work is needed to bring this puppy home. Then one victim shows up that did not die but is trapped inside her own body due to her injury and can barely communicate. Can horne get enough from her to solve the case?

Thorne is a rather interesting character. He's sort of a loner with a thing for sappy country and wester songs. But he's one of those guys who sees things others don't and it puts him at the top of the list for solving crimes. This quality makes his fellow detective Kevin Tughan (Eddie Marsan) more than a bit jealous. Little by little Thorne makes things work. But when it all comes to head this outing falls apart like a cheap suit. This is a shame because it's an interesting premise with some nifty plot points. Morrissey does a good job as Thorne. He reminds me a bit of Liam Neeson. Eddie Marsan is always good and he does a fine job here up until they screw up his role in the final scenes. Amanda Root is Okay as ""sleepyhead."" Then there's Natascha McElhone as the chief doctor and love interest Anne Coburn. She's too pretty with hair and makeup to the 9s and never shows up in scrubs. She's always adorned in the latest of hip fashions.

I never really understood the motive of the killer. Maybe I just zoned out at the ineptitude of the final scenes and missed that part of it. But this is nowhere as good as it could, or should, have been given everything at its core. Don't bother with this unless your a hopeless mystery/thriller junkie who has watched everything else there is to watch.",1416355200,,1947,4.430167597765363

8417498,3,B0046XRCJY,"I watched ""Sleepyhead"" and the plot didn't make sense. I watched ""Scaredy Cat"" and the plot didn't make sense.  I re-watched both, paying close attention, and still the plots didn't make sense.  So I bought the books and read them, and the plots of the books made sense but are different than those on the DVDs; even the killers in the books are different characters than the killers on the DVDs.

The characters in both the DVDs and the books were intense in their interactions, which was interesting, but I've gotten rather tired of and impatient with sensitive and damaged police detectives spattering angst all over.  I found the police characters in ""Whitechapel"" much more believable--especially DS Miles, who is more the suck-it-up-and-tough-it-out type of detective.  I also found it interesting that in ""Thorne,"" the character of DI Tughan has been sanitized for television; in the two books, he is a serial sex offender who hasn't been caught, and in the DVDs, he's just smarmy (and well-played by Eddie Marsan).

I would say that, if you don't care much about the plot making sense, and you like watching the interaction of characters who don't like each other very much, then go ahead and give the ""Thorne"" DVDs a go.  But I found the books altogether more satisfying than the screen adaptations.",1368403200,,1308,4.891402714932127

8417500,3,B0046XRCJY,"I bought these hoping for something that levels with Inspector Lewis or Inspector Morse, this is close but they seem to feel the story is less important than imaginative distracting camera work.

8417501,4,B0046XRCJY,"With the summer television doldrums upon us, I found myself trolling OnDemand for something, anything diverting and engaging, when I stumbled upon the television adaptations of Mark Billingham's Thorne series.  Both stories based on Billingham's first two novels, each of theater film length, are terrific hunts for demented serial killers.  Both feature iconoclastic, rebellious, tormented, intense, acerbic DI Tom Thorne and his office of coppers, a couple of whom have it in for him.

In Sleepyhead, Thorne and the team, that includes his old boyhood friend pathologist and ME Phil Hendricks, rush to find a killer whose intent is transforming women into comatose veggies.  It's tough getting it right as they die on him.  But he does succeed once.  Thorne develops an interest in the girl and with the help of romantic interest Dr. Anne Coburn communicates wordlessly with her.  Lots of twists and turns, including a revelation of a seemingly foul deed in Thorne's past.

In Scaredycat, the better of the two, Thorne and the team, that features Sandra Oh as coke-snorting DS Sarah Chen, face a serial killer duo, though a fellow detective reminds Thorne these killers work solo.  Thorne blows him off, and the chase is on.

All performers are wonderful.  David Morrissey portrays Tom Thorne with intensity.  The film style, featuring plenty of effects that play with focus and perspective are unusual for television and always intriguing.  And, for Americans at least, there's a welcome change of location in London.  Fascinating not only to view panorama but also the interiors of London offices and flats.

As always, I'm more interested in the serial killer than ferreting out of him.  For this reason, I favor Scaredycat over Sleepyhead.

8417502,5,B0046XRCJY,"Now and then during channel surfing late at night there appears something new and unknown that results in making the viewer wish for more.  Such is the case for the series THORNE.  It is a high tension thriller of a series.

`Thorne' is DI Tom Thorne (David Morrissey) who in the Sleepyhead episode enters an investigation into a mysterious serial killer. His first three victims ended up dead. His fourth was not so fortunate. Alison Willetts (Sara Lloyd-Gregory ) is unlucky to be alive. She has survived a stroke, deliberately induced by manipulation of pressure points on the head and neck. She can see, hear and feel, she is aware of everything going on around her, but she is unable to move or communicate. In leaving Alison alive, the police believe the killer's made his first mistake.  And it is this kind of complex story-weaving that makes this a very tense and enjoyable series. Written by Dudi Appleton and Jim Keeble and directed with panache by Benjamin Ross, the large cast includes some very fine actors - David Morrissey is at the top of the list - that includes Eddie Marsan, Sandra Oh, Lily Loveless, Neil Kelly among others.  We can only hope that this 2010 series has more parts to it and that those episodes will reach our shores and TV screens.  Definitely recommended for lovers of high mystery and thrillers.

8417503,1,B0046XRCJY,"First things to be known.
i am a huge fan of Mark Billingham. He is a greatly talented writer and I will read every word he produces.
I enjoy the Tom thorne series of books.
But we are discussing the Tom Thorne adaptation for TV, at the moment.
Blazingly horrible. Terrible. As if a team went to work to to see if they could generate a travesty; a mis-characterization, a cartoon shadow of poor Mark's books and protagonist, Tom Thorne.
Every value in this production from adaption to, casting, to mediocre to poor acting, to lead weighted direction, to dreadful sound, EVERY VALUE was BAD.
How bad?
Bad enough to make me grit my teeth hoping that there would be a saving element. One never showed up.
Never.
I will continue to seek out Mark Billingham's new book issues, and run like a thief from any further encounters with the TV adaptations.
They do NOT deserve a second chance.
This adaption got one star for working in my DVD player.
It went downhill from there.",1322697600,4,968,4.537142857142857
