4084061,5,B0038ABWY2,"Ryan Hall is great at breaking down concepts and techniques into easily understandable terms. His videos always provide tons of ways to apply an attack with how to counter the defense to the attack as well. There are so many situations and scenarios that you will coming back to this DVD set to review them for a long time.

I recommend this DVD set to grapplers of all skill levels. There is sure to be something in this set that will change your game for the better.",1403568000,3,468,4.379310344827586
4084062,5,B0038ABWY2,Great dvd set. Hope he comes out with one with position control n escapes. He explains stuff pretty well. Good dvd,1394496000,2,114,4.476190476190476
4084063,5,B0038ABWY2,This is a great instructional! This the first of three of Ryan Hall's DVD sets I've bought. This guy is the real deal and has a great competition record to prove it. There's some really good tips on how to bring your triangle to the next level in this DVD. I highly recommend all of his sets!,1391644800,2,292,4.140350877192983
4084064,5,B0038ABWY2,"First DVD I've really bought to learn from and I'm glad I went with this one.

Ryan Hall does a great job of showing things to look for and do while also explaining very common misconceptions that are taught everywhere. Already I've been finding myself a lot more comfortable using the triangle as just a control situation without feeling like I'm going to be easily passed.

Well worth the money.",1365465600,3,397,4.6571428571428575
4084065,4,B0038ABWY2,"The triangle dvd set is pretty awesome overall but I think it is overpriced (I bought it at $89 plus shipping). You can get some apps out there for like 10-15% of the price and cover much of the same material. However, if you have the money then the set is solid.

Here is what I like:
-great explanations; very clear and thorough
-Disc 1 is a must for beginners like me. It walks you through how to finish the triangle (his method is different than the traditional method most people learn). Disc 1 covers the mechanics of the triangle and the variations of it (switch figure 4 and reverse triangle). He covers other stuff too. You can google it to get the chapter titles.
-Disc 2 was awesome too. The chapters on how to break posture were good for me.
-He gives a decent amount of set ups and different positions to set it up from.
-Maybe the best part for me was his stuff on how to control angles and posture. I haven't tried any of those techniques yet but they seem reasonable, logical and I hope to get working on those soon.
-Disc 3 was a bit advanced. Perhaps when I watch thru again I will get more out of it.

Here is what could be improved:
-I would love to see live footage WiTH commentary from him using slow motion and replay when appropriate to clearly demonstrate how he used the techniques in actually sparring and/or competition. Why? Well, for beginners like me, things don't always go as planned. It would be nice to see how he uses these techniques with resistance. For the price, I think this is fair.
-I would have like to have give more advice addressing more counters to the triangle. How do you counter certain counters? Granted, he gave a lot of big picture stuff with the posture/angle control but still, for guys slow like me it would have been a bit better for the price.

Overall the set is awesome. Could have been a bit cheaper in my opinion based on my previous comments on apps. If you are looking to improve your triangle then this is it. The great thing is that Hall goes on small tangents about other positions and submissions so you learn a lot more than just triangles. If you have the money then I recommend this set for beginners like me and probably even intermediate guys too.",1340496000,6,2221,4.385922330097087
4084066,5,B0038ABWY2,"I attended a Ryan Hall seminar last year in my home town. I'm a slow learner with a pathetic attention span, I have attended a few seminars and never took anything of benefit away. At Ryan's seminar I upped my game with a few easily applied and super logical techniques. The reason why is clearly demonstrated in this DVD... the guy is a thinker.

Rather than try and impress the viewer with dazzling set ups and finishes, he at first gives us a thorough explanation of the mechanics of this choke. This is done in a very concise manner and with a sound, scientific explanation for each aspect of the finish and set up. Even if you only watched disc one, your triangle finish will become about 10 times better.

The other two discs cover various control tactics and set ups, again all of these are backed up with solid physics and are very easy to follow due to the videos being well paced, each set up is broken down and repeated just enough to sink in. My triangle game has totally blossomed since buying this DVD set, much of the stuff contained here in goes against the basics that we are taught in the first month of BJJ but is clearly superior when applied to live sparring.

My only criticism is the omission of any live footage of Ryan applying these set ups and finishes in top level competition as watching his comp footage after seeing this DVD is a whole new experience. Also the thinly veiled rubber guard bashing throughout gets to be a bit much to be honest.

Simply put this will actually change your view of the triangle choke, I now view it as a position rather than a submission. It is the best instructional I have seen and a lot of its concepts will surely become the standard things we see at competitions in years to come. Well worth the considerable cost, also it arrived super quickly. Perfect.",1338336000,13,1819,4.453453453453453
4084067,4,B0038ABWY2,"Ryan Hall earned most of his early fame by using the triangle in tons of torunaments. I saw You Tube clips and advertisements long before I bought the video. The good thing about this training video is that his techniques can complement more traditional views on how to use the triangle or be used as a unique method. Ryan Hall seems like someone who uses technique to win. I did not give a five star rating because I have not been able to train that much since purchasing it. The few times I did, Hall's lessons showed promise on the mat. The school I train at, Laselva MMA, is a traditional BJJ school, so far as BJJ is concerned (I have not done the MMA program) and does not specifically teach Hall's methods. As with all developing martial arts, however, there is considerable crossover and the basics are all similar.",1337904000,,823,4.493333333333333

8391146,4,B0038ABWY2,"Content is great and immediately applicable. However video will skip over sequences. For example, you start the second DVD and it will talk about being on the 11th variation...so we just left the other 10 variations out of the DVD? Happens a lot. Another example is you'll hear Ryan say ""for the third and final one"" when it's really only the 2nd. So the DVDs are skipping things.",1528761600,,380,4.602941176470588

This DVD is the Bible of triangle choke knowledge. If you fully implement this DVD into your game you'll have the knowledge to finish a triangle in any situation. Ryan Hall is a genius at breaking down Jiu Jitsu strategy, technique and principles.",1430265600,2,495,4.963855421686747
