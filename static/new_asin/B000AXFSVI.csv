8080042,5,B000AXFSVI,"Ideal for learning the correct pronunciation of certain words and letters because there are exceptions to some rules; for example, the letter o is pronounced ""oh"", but in certain phrases where there is a ""KO"" it is pronounced kah.  After kinda learning the Russian alphabet, it is now easier for me to read the actual Russian phrase as the speakers are talking in Russian.  I also like how there is a female and male speaker because some words and phrases are both masculine and feminine.  I know my biggest challenge is going to be learning the vocabulary and then getting the speed of the actual speaking correct.  So far I haven't been putting in 12 or 16 hour days on this, but I have learned some and am learning more and more each day.

This product is certainly helping!!!!!!!!",1366416000,,784,4.611510791366906
8080043,3,B000AXFSVI,"This is a good product overall if you already know the alphabet, as the previous reviewer said. It also helps to know basic words so that stringing them together is easier. I would recommend this video only as a supplement to other basic materials because there are several typos throughout. I have found misspellings that are obvious if you're playing close attention and some other mistakes where the wrong word appears on the screen, though the pronunciation is correct. So be careful not to base your Russian on this product alone! Having said that, I borrowed it from my local library and don't regret it.",1345248000,2,610,4.819047619047619
8080044,5,B000AXFSVI,"It's a hard language to learn, and I bought this to supplement my text book and other materials.  Learn the russian sounds (alphabet) first and this will be a great help to you !  Have been to the country before and will be returning there
