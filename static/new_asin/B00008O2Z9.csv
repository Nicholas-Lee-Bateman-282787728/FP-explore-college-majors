7985867,1,B00008O2Z9,The fact that someone put money and time to produce this crap goes to show to the world that Jorge Olguin and Nicolas Lopez should be neutered for the sake of cinema.,1469059200,,166,4.21875
7985868,3,B00008O2Z9,"I have not heard good reviews about Troma so was not expecting anything special. Well, I didn't receive anything special. This is a VHS rip. Granted, the transfer is OK as is the audio. How do I know it's a VHS RIP? Well when it's letterboxed in 4:3 frame and the 'black' bars above the image have a green shade to them. it's a rip.  Not so bad if Troma told customers as such however I'll give 3 stars because unlike other companies, at least Troma hasn't plastered ""Digitally remastered"" on the sleeve. If you want this movie and can get it for a few bucks then worth it otherwise stay clear.",1424390400,,594,4.303571428571429
7985869,3,B00008O2Z9,A waste of money frist off it saids english it starts off in english then goes to something else. I didn't get to watch it because to me it wasn't worth it what few mens i did see,1405728000,,179,3.736842105263158
7985870,1,B00008O2Z9,"An incident happens during a graduation celebration and Angel Negro (Blanca Lewin), the weird girl goes missing off a cliff and her body is never recovered. Her boyfriend Gabriel (&Aacute;lvaro Morales) is grief stricken. Year later Gabriel is a coroner as bodies of his classmates start to show up. Gabriel goes Quincy as he suspects Angel, or her ghost is to blame.

The film moves slow. The who-dun-it aspect is not that great. The film does show some of the oldest looking fourth graders I have ever seen. This is not a horror film, but more like a sad mystery.

F-bomb. The film has a Troma opening which includes female nudity. The actual film shows dead male corpse nudity.",1403395200,,680,4.705882352941177
7985871,4,B00008O2Z9,"Forget this is not the best horror movie, forget this is not an excellent production and masterprice movie. Just get fun and know about the ""ghost"" involved there, guess who's alive and who's death. Try to discover what really happened. Don't waste the time studyng the screenplay, the production, the cameras direction or don't try to find faults. Just follow this story, enter to this mistery and get fun! I love this game. I loved to follow the case. I didn't ned subtitles, I sepak spanish and that's excellent to enjoy more.",1090368000,2,529,4.760869565217392
