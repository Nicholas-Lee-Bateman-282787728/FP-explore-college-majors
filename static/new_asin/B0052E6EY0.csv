4529827,1,B0052E6EY0,"OK, confession, I did not see this flick but others' comments have turned me away.  I can't stand the gratuitous and ignorant trashing of Wagner, who was a deeply compassionate man and who chose a Jew to be his final conductor (for Parsifal).  Also, two of his eight pallbearers at his funeral were Jews.  So Tony, lighten up. They weren't all Jewish Uncle Toms  ...",1408924800,4,366,4.584615384615384

4529829,5,B0052E6EY0,"I was fortunate enough to see this in a theatrical screening back in the 80s, it was an overwhelming experience. Prior to this release it was only available in a ""pan-and-scan"", poorly mastered VHS format. This DVD release allows the home viewer to see, for the first time, the original widescreen aspect ratio, and both the audio and video transfers are excellent. Wagner is one of my favorite composers and Burton is one of my favorite actors, so this combination could not have been better. Redgraves, although markedly more attractive than the ""real"" Cosima creates a portrait of a woman completely devoted to man whom she loves. The ""cameos"" by Guilgood, Richardson, and Olivier are perfect (note: this is the ONLY time all 3 ever appeared on film together), and the rest of the supporting cast is completely believable. This is definately an ""art"" film, with many abstract touches, flashback, flash forwards, etc that might make it difficult to follow on a first viewing, but on a second viewing the profundity of the editing can be appreciated. Some other reviews have commented on how hateful a person Wagner was - it's true, he WAS a narcissitic beast who lived only for himself and who held political/social views that by today's standards are almost embarrassing. But history is what it is, and for better or worse, Burton brings his character to the front; you might not ""like"" him very much after watching this, but you will have a very solid appreciation of who the man was. If I had one disappointment in the film it would be that there are actually very few recreated scenes of his operas being staged - but the entire film is scored with his music performed by Solti, so there is no lack of Wagner's music in this film. I cannot recommend it highly enough!",1402531200,16,1773,4.741100323624596
4529830,5,B0052E6EY0,A beautiful tribute to arguably one of the most accomplished artists of all times.  The Ring is probably the most complete work of art ever accomplished by any artist in any genre.,1378080000,,180,4.625

4529833,1,B0052E6EY0,"This is over 7 hours and comes on 3 discs. I'll admit something up front: I only got through the first disc. I really did want to like this. On paper, it looks like it should be fabulous: colourful historical character, great actors, great music, shot on location, etc. But I cannot bring myself to watch the rest of it. If you feel that disqualifies me from providing a review, I guess you should read no further. I wish you luck with your own viewing. For the rest of you, I am faced with a dilemma. Just how much detail should I provide, so that you don't think I'm simply an uneducated moron who is unable to appreciate ""art"". By the same token I don't want to waste too much more of my life on this film. So I've decided to just list out some of the problems with this film, rather than put them altogether into a cogent, well-structured argument. You can take from it what you will:

- The portrayal of Wagner as a spendthrift, vain, self important, emotionally cold, nasty bully is so relentless, that it quickly gets tiring. There is no contrast, no light and darkness. He treats everyone with scorn and contempt. So much so it's hard to imagine anyone loving him, or any woman wanting to have an affair with him. Whatever his faults, I find the portrayal hard to believe. And the allusions to Hitler in some of the Dresden scenes are altogether embarrassing and over the top.
- A lot of the scenes drag, much longer than is necessary, long after they've made the point they were trying to make, like the endless scenes of Wagner and Minna talking in their sitting room. And then we are presented with another scene that is essentially making the same point, but in another context. I realise some repetition is necessary to get across particular character flaws, but there's no need to beat your audience over the head with a sledgehammer. How many scenes do we need to establish his spendthrift manner? His German nationalism? His cruel treatment of his wife? Some judicious editing would have been nice. Making an ""epic"" doesn't mean that you just stuff everything you want into a movie, and exercise no critical judgment.
- There are a lot of long-winded speeches (Wagner talking at length, railing against anyone and everyone, with people patiently listening), or outright weird scenes and dialogue in the style of European art house, that just annoyed the hell out of me, e.g. where people suddenly cry out, or say something absurd. Like Wager standing in a crowded room at a function, screaming out, unnaturally, something like, ""Listen to me, damn you! Damn You! Listen to me! I'm Wagner!"" Okay, I get it, it shows he was desperate to be heard, that he felt like people weren't listening to him etc. But it comes across as clumsy and gauche. In another set of scenes, Wagner kept waking up from a nightmare and screaming: ""Nothing to do with her! Nothing at all to do with Mathilde Wesendonck!"" (his muse and potential lover). Okay, once I can forgive, but the scene repeated over and over? In another scene, also repeated ad nauseam, we see a dwarf blacksmith forging the famed ""ring"" in front of a fire. Speaking off which, there is one very odd scene where Wagner is talking to one his dalliances on a French beach and says, full of gravity, ""Where is there a blacksmith? Where? I need to hear the sound of metal being struck. I must learn to forge metal."" To which the lover responds, ""I must learn to walk."" They then walk along the beach, and she says, ""Richard, your words, your ideas, they fill me with confusion...love!"" He says with gravitas, ""Yes, love."" And she shrieks, ""I give it to you freely!"" all to the swelling strains of Lohengrin. I laughed out loud.
- The script is full of such purple prose, with people talking in a manner, and stringing words together, that is hard to take seriously. There's also a problem with Burton's delivery. It's like a theatre piece, as if he's on stage in some kind of Shakespearean drama. I just didn't buy it. It felt like I was watching an actor delivering a particularly bad script. It's as if he thought that every word uttered by Wagner was important, and that Wagner likewise must have thought that every word he uttered was important, even if he was just asking for toast and marmalade.
- Even when Wagner is quoting something that Wagner actually wrote, like his poem Siegfried, the extract is way too long. Okay, I guess the filmmaker wanted to establish just why it is that everyone in the scene is falling asleep or snoring, but do we really need that much to get it?
- Some of the scene progressions are unbelievably stupid and clichd. Like Minna telling Wagner ""I hate noise...bangs"" just before an explosion signalling the start of revolution in Dresden. To which she responds by dramatically turning her head and saying ""My God. It has begun."" Really?
- Some scenes and relationships with individuals are poorly set up and explained, like the love affair with Jessie Laussot. We're left with no explanation as to how this relationship came about (save for the ridiculous scene on the beach mentioned above), or what motivated Wagner other than a desire to get his rocks off.
- There's an awful sex scene, that includes a close-up, full-frontal (and totally unnecessary) shot of a woman's vagina, in the same art house style, replete with bushy, matted, curly orange pubic hair. Honestly.
- The film has a narrator. That's fine - the narrator is used to disclose elements of Wagner's story, and to explain some of the inter-relationships, but the tone is often the kind of tone that is used to tell bedtime stories to children. I found it cloying and annoying.
- Burton is way too old for the earlier scenes. I know, he was a great actor - yaddah yaddah - but it just doesn't work. It'd be like watching my grandfather trying to play me at 40. The problem is that we have an actor of advanced years trying to play a middle-aged Wagner.
- Some of the longer scenes start with music in the background, then the music suddenly cuts out when there is a shot change within the same scene. It's jarring and completely unexplained. I can only assume that when it was edited for television, the scene was broken up with an ad?
- Solti's conducting is a disappointment. Or maybe the sound just doesn't cut it these days? I was underwhelmed in any event.

Okay, I'll stop there. I think you get the picture. I rarely cannot watch something through to the end, but this qualifies for that distinction. Maybe in another era, as a television mini series, this might have worked. But not today.",1320796800,28,6562,4.602903501280957
4529834,5,B0052E6EY0,"Excellent film... who but Richard Burton to play the Great Richard Wagner?
Nice also to see Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson.  Those who have studied Wagner, will see a lot of modern political views at play in this lovely film but his music is so refined that one is able to enjoy his majestic music dramas,  despite the usual attempted character assasination.  This film is worthy of recommendation to all who appreciate Wagner and his music and able to distinguish fact from excessive distorted fiction.  All in the fascinating power that Wagner evokes to all,  friend or foe.",1225584000,10,587,4.83

8453832,1,B0052E6EY0,I have the earlier DVD set but was disappointed with the quality.  Is this new one a remastered version?,1485129600,,104,4.473684210526316
8453833,3,B0052E6EY0,"I love Wagner's music and expected a lot of it in this movie.  Unfortunately for me (I'm sorta' a classical prude) the first of 3 discs was full of Wagner's early revolutionary involvement and a truly X-rated scene of his escapades with a naked woman.  The next CD's proved more to my liking with Wagner's music in the background much of the time -- of course, he was getting older and a bit more wise and ""refined"". I must say, the acting was superb -- but I'd never exchange this DVD for the CD of Sir Adrian Boult's CD recording of Wagner's Overtures and Preludes.",1474329600,,567,4.390476190476191
8453834,4,B0052E6EY0,"What to say about this immense, involved and involving movie?  I first bought it as a vhs 30 years ago and believed for a long time that it was only 4:3.  Come to find it is full 35 mm 16:9.  Bought it a second time as 'the complete epic' on dvd.  But now I was hearing rumors of the 16:9 format and wondered when it would come out.  And here it is finally.  I have watched this show who knows how many times.  I love to tell people that it is the only time that you will see Sir Lawrence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson, and Sir John Gielgud together on the screen at the same time.  But still, why hasn't someone like criterion taken what by now is clearly a cultural artifact of the world and done it up as it deserves?  This most recent edition is still in need of cleaning, fuller audio (I mean, for heaven's sake, Solti!, yes!) and lots and lots of extra features.  Simply one of the great masterpieces of cinema.  Yes, Yes, I could go on and on here.  BLURAY DONE RIGHT...I AM WAITING!!!!!",1473984000,,994,4.173684210526316

8453838,5,B0052E6EY0,"Loved this film. It really gives me a feeling for what Wagner might have been like if I had lived in his time. Very careful attention to details. As a total Wagner addict I am familiar most of the details of Wagner's life, so it's wonderful to have these same details brought out in a film. A lot of money went into the making of this movie and really paying attention to detail. I was really impressed. My secret pleasure was in identifying  the musical excerpts on the first or second note -- a kind of game I played with myself. The acting was great, especially Richard Burton. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to get to know Wagner more as a man. I really appreciate this film.",1445731200,2,690,4.3076923076923075
