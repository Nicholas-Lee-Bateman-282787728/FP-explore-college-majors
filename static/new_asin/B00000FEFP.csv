7908364,3,B00000FEFP,"Arrived in great condition; but the tape jams periodically and has fuzzy spots.  I don't blame the seller... it is, afterall, an imported VHS.  Still, it's a unique film in the martial arts genre, and I'm glad I bought it.  The storyline is about a man and his daughter who ""adopt"" 3 other children, who are later sold into nefarious circumstances, and are now back for revenge.  That one of the abused children is forced to become a eunuch, is an interesting story in itself, as the character treatment is unusually contemporary, given the age of the film.",1439510400,,557,4.653061224489796
