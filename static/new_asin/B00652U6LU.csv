""Flying Deuces"" & ""Utopia"" has the Goodtimes Video menu at the beginning and is ripped from their DVD, the ""Classic Moments"" program has the ""GT"" bug at the bottom, so that was also obviously ripped from the Goodtimes video tape. ""Parade"" is a 30 minute edited version of ""Bonnie Scotland"". Poor quality. I recommend avoiding this one.",1463529600,,395,4.91044776119403

8493237,5,B00652U6LU,"Listen, I did not watch these movies when they made first viewing. However, I really like them. Imagine a comedy without 'F' bombs, without 'T&A'--you know what it is...  Comedy that it is not satire to pick on politicians, politics or other movies. Classic, original comedy of mishaps, misunderstandings and happy times. You will need to trust me on this.",1378166400,,356,4.933333333333334

8493239,4,B00652U6LU,"Interesting collection of Laurel & Hardy films the 2 main films Utopia(aka Robinson Crusoeland or Atoll K)& The Flying Deuces are available in one form or another from other labels, the 2 documentaries are intersting though film quality is not so good, like its been taken & recorded from the TV onto VHS tape. That said Utopia was the pairs last film together though funny at times they were showing their age, & Stan was very ill at the time & he looks gaunt & thin you have to wonder why they decided to go ahead & make it, their magic was still there but its not how I personally want to remember them. Shame Stan did not accept a part in Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World in 1963(he died in 1965)it would have been his only role in glorious Technicolor.",1329523200,2,752,4.265734265734266
