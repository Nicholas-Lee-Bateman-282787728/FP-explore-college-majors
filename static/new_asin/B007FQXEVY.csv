5082841,5,B007FQXEVY,The best actor in four of his greatest movies. I am a huge Bogie fan and this collection is great. My wife and I watch them over and over. Never get tired of seeing them especially when nothing is on that is interesting. It is a must have for any Bogie fan.,1359244800,3,257,3.9615384615384617
5082842,3,B007FQXEVY,"Not as great as I was expecting it to be. I love Humphrey Bogart, and the movies were enjoyable, an okay collection.",1358812800,,116,4.318181818181818
5082843,5,B007FQXEVY,"TCM and Warner keep on truckin' with these 4-great-films-for-cheap releases.  After buying some of the newer titles it appears they have officially abandoned their double-sided flipper discs and opted for reusing the original single-sided discs with same disc labels (BTW these collections are all re-releases, nothing new).  However they are housed in a stackable hub case which some people believe could scratch discs somehow.  I've never come across a disc that's been damaged in these cases so I much prefer it over the flipper discs.  With twice the discs (and subsequently the label artwork as well) it feels like you're getting just a little more for your money.

As for the films themselves, they are all quintessential classic cinema at it's finest.  While Bogie isn't the lead in 2 of them (The Petrified Forest, The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse) he is fantastic in the smaller roles.  All of them boast phenomenal casts with the likes of Edward G. Robinson, Ida Lupino, Bette Davis, Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers.  All Through the Night isn't really a gangster film but instead features Bogie as a good-natured kingpin gambler complete with a hilarious posse who uncovers an underground ring of Nazis - doesn't really fit in with the other movies but great stuff nonetheless.  All discs have some special features like Warner's ""Night at the Movies"" which presents you with a period-appropriate trailer, newsreel, short subject and cartoon just like you would have seen at the theater back then.

More 4-movie collections from TCM & Warner will most likely be on the way given the rate they are cranking them out now.  About 1/3 of the DVDs from their Warner Bros. Gangster Collections haven't yet been re-released in these moneysavers and they've got an incredible catalog of existing releases to pull from.  After passing on a lot of DVDs over the years, it's convenient to see some get a second life at a more economical rate.",1358208000,40,1938,4.984472049689441

5082869,5,B007FQXEVY,"Turner Classics are definitely the way to go if you like vintage movies.  Their extras are just as engaging as the movies themselves.  The prints they use are always high quality.  Sound quality is also top notch.  All the films come with subtitles.  Before we started watching these movies we had only seen a few Bogart films.  It's easy to see why he has such a stellar reputation.  The actors, direction, and stories attached to these films are miles beyond what we see today.  About the only thing they do better now is special effects and even CG can be cheesy.",1478304000,9,566,4.534653465346534

5082872,4,B007FQXEVY,"Painted Desert and High Sierra are above average flics of that era.  The other two are OK entertainment, but totally unnoteworthy.  Desert and Sierra are desirable additions to a Bogart collection, displaying the range of his talent.  The stories are quite good, but the screenplay rather uninspired.  The car chase in Sierra was quite good, and thankfully did not have any of the now required flaming crashes.  As usual for this era, nobody knew how to handle a firearm.",1476662400,,471,4.9113924050632916

Makes you wish each of the 4 would come out on Blu-ray...""All Through the Night"" is both suspenseful and funny, with Jackie Gleason & Phil Silvers --some years before either were TV stars-- in bit roles...The true classics are ""High Sierra"" with Bogie as the doomed parolee out to make a final score and ""The Petrified Forest"" in which he made a gigantic impact as Duke Mantee, the Dillinger-like escapee who takes control of a desert cafe.

5082922,3,B007FQXEVY,I purchased this dvd set because I'm a big Humphrey Bogart fan. I love the movie High Sierra and Petrified Forest but All Through the Night has got to be the worst Humphrey Bogart movie I have ever seen!  I don't know why they included Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse in this package because the star of the movie is Edward G. Robinson not Humphrey Bogart. All in all you get three good movies and one piece of junk movie.,1417305600,2,415,4.32051282051282

5082924,3,B007FQXEVY,"This collection is okay at best. The majority of the films were made before Humphrey Bogart became a film force. For example, for two of the films in this collection, Bogart was a supporting player and wasn't the central character. High Sierra is worth the purchase price. If you consider the other film as just a bonus, you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for more, then I suggest considering another collection.",1410825600,,423,4.808219178082192

5082932,4,B007FQXEVY,"Humphrey Bogart is excellent in all four of the films.  I was especially fond of ""All Through the Night"".  Bogey's portrayal of a gangster with a heart is excellent.",1384819200,,165,4.655172413793103
5082933,3,B007FQXEVY,"The one I had not seen and enjoyed the most was, as it turns out, his debut movie as a main character and where Bette Davis must have been 20 years old, if that!  These were not his best, or most famous roles and I can't say I'd highly recommend purchasing this group of four.  Although, High Sierras is always good. Unlike the Cagney Gangsters, where the group of four were all excellent, whoever made the selections for Bogart's movies should go back to the drawing board.",1384041600,,474,4.436781609195402
5082934,5,B007FQXEVY,"The petrified Forrest: while the main storyline was a romance, and bogie was a minor character, it was thoroughly enjoyable!
High Sierra: I loved it, kept me entertained! It was a simply delightful movie!
Dr. Clitterhouse: a good movie, weird premise but enjoyable.
All through the night: is a twisting plot involving nazis, sports betting and murder. Obviously filmed during World War Two.",1383264000,2,390,5.2063492063492065

5082938,5,B007FQXEVY,"Humphrey is at his best in Petrified Forest and High Sierra. These are earlier films before casablanca and after a lot of gangster early films, It shows the versatility and depth of acting Humphrey could do, such a talented actor.",1364515200,10,230,4.775
