5837734,5,B00DNQKF2G,"Like the first box set, this set includes 25-minute documentaries on each Doctor (#5, 6, 7 & 8), an introduction by Steven Moffatt at the beginning of each adventure, and each story has a widescreen feature-length version included with this set as well as the original aired versions.

Includes ""Earthshock"" with Doctor #5 Peter Davison. A great action-packed story that features the triumphant return of the Cybermen (the first in seven years) with a great emotional and heartbreaking farewell (or should I say death) of a companion. Certainly the best story in Peter Davison's first season. Five stars

Then we have ""Vengeance on Varos"" with Doctor #6 Colin Baker. Although I never found Colin Baker's run really that memorable, I have to say that ""Vengeance on Varos"" was certainly one of his better stories. Quite thrilling and entertaining, one of the best aspects of this adventure is the evil slug-like villain Sil played to perfection by Nabil Shaban. Four stars

Next we have ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" with Doctor #7 Sylvester McCoy. I've always loved Sylvester's Doctor and ""Remembrance"" was always one of my favorite Who stories. An action-packed adventure with a great story, impressive visuals for Dr. Who at that time, an all-star cast, and a lot of mystery that keeps you guessing until the end. Two rival Dalek factions are waging war with each other in 1963 London in an attempt to gain possession of an ancient Time Lord artifact left on Earth by the Doctor himself during his first incarnation. Now the Doctor must fight to save the universe from his oldest enemies. Five stars

Last we have ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" with Doctor #8 Paul McGann. Although there have been many who have criticized this story, I've always found it quite enjoyable. An action-packed adventure featuring the newly regenerated Eighth Doctor taking on his old Time Lord rival, the Master, in 1999 San Francisco. Can the Doctor stop his archenemy from bringing about the end of the world before the new millennium? Sure this one has got some plot holes in it, but I can forgive it for that because it's still a very entertaining adventure with some great action scenes, great visuals, a very scary Master, a great cast, and a great Doctor who sadly never got to make another onscreen appearance. Four stars

If you found and bought these DVDs individually, you'd spend a lot more money. I love that you have the option of watching each story as individual episodes or the edited version where it is shown as an unbroken story.

The special feature are truly pitiful! There is a feature where various people involved in Dr Who talk about that particular actor's portrayal of the Doctor. There is an introduction by Steven Moffat. That's it! There is no commentary, no still photos, bios or any of the other goodies that are usually included in Dr Who DVDs,

5 and 6 really didn't do much for me. Just could not get into them.

7, on the other hand, is really well made. Though, the poor Daleks really need a budget.

I feel very bad for 8. I do agree that he is one of the better Doctors. Darn shame he didn't get more of a chance.

Do yourself a favor, and watch the episodes, before watching the retrospectives. They assume you know everything that is going on, so spoilers abound for the episodes included.

Definitely worth picking up for the new Dr. Who fan.",1381449600,10,600,4.321428571428571
5837737,5,B00DNQKF2G,"BCC's Doctor Who is celebrating its 50th anniversary next month with the special ""The Day of the Doctor,"" but before then you can experience the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth doctors with today's release of Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited: Fifth - Eighth, starring Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann in four exciting adventures, Earthshock, Vengeance on Varos, Remembrance of the Daleks, and Doctor Who - The Movie, on four discs.

Earthshock aired in March 1982 and has the Doctor (played by Peter Davison) and his companions (Adric, Nyssa or Tegan) arriving on Earth in the future. They explore a few caves and run into Lieutenant Scott and his men, who claim the Doctor and companions killed Professor Kyle's exploration team. The Doctor convinces Scott that they didn't have anything to do with Kyle's disappearance and offers his assistance to help with the search, leading the Doctor to come face to face with the Cybermen.

Colin Baker plays the Doctor in Vengeance On Varos, which originally aired in January 1985. After the TARDIS comes to a complete stop in the middle of space, the Doctor and his companion (Peri Brown) go to Varos (formerly a prison planet) in search of Zeiton-7, which is what the TARDIS needs to run properly again. The planet is operated by the evil Governor and getting the Zeiton-7 will be more difficult (even deadly) for the Doctor.

Remembrance of the Daleks first hit the airwaves in October 1988 starring Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor, who (along with his companion, Ace) arrives in Shoreditch in 1963, where they track down the strange magnetic fluctuations near the Coal Hill School, which happens to be a grey Dalek. The Daleks have followed The Doctor through time in search of the Hand of Omega; all leading to the return of the creator and leader, Davros.

Seven years after the original BBC series ended, Doctor Who returned for one night on Fox and later aired on BBC One in the UK with Sylvester McCoy briefly returning to regenerate in Doctor Who: The Movie. Paul McGann took over the role of the Doctor for the made-for-television movie that finds the Doctor with no memory after the regenerations and is aided by Dr. Grace Holloway. To make matters worse, black ooze escapes from the box containing the remains of the Master and enters into the body of an ambulance driver; therefore regenerating into the Master, who is hell-bent on destroying the Doctor.

Each disc has the option to watch the original broadcast version or the widescreen special feature version with an introduction by Steven Moffat. There is also a 24-minute documentary on each disc. Inside the DVD case is a set of four Doctor Who fridge magnets.

I've been a Doctor Who fan since ""Rose"" aired on the Sci-fi Channel (now known as SyFy) in 2006; though I was aware of the previous incarnations, I had only seen the Doctor Who films with Peter Cushing at the time. With the 50th anniversary this year, BBC is releasing the best of each Doctor in three DVD set releases for both new and old fans. Earthshock started a bit slow for me, but the pacing picks up when the Cybermen are revealed, all leading to a shocking ending (I won't spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen the episode, but most fans are aware of who dies.) Vengeance on Varos is completely different than any other Doctor Who episode. Despite its slow pacing, it is cleverly written. Remembrance of the Daleks is the final appearance of the Davros and the Daleks in the original series run and just like other Dalek episodes, it is action-packed. I had already seen Doctor Who - The Movie, as it was released on a 2-disc set back in 2011, but there is a new documentary about the eight Doctor on this release. The movie was meant to be a reboot and a backdoor-pilot, but due to horrible marketing and a bad timeslot, it didn't put much of a dent in the ratings. I do admire the producers for connecting to the original series with Sylvester McCoy's cameo. Overall, Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited: Fifth - Eighth is a must have for any fan. I enjoyed watching each episode (or movie) and I recommend it to others.

""Revisted 5-8"" has 4 discs. Each Doctor has a celebratory documentary/Special looking back on his tenure. There are interviews, photos and clips from various series. For Doctors 5-7, each special is followed by a favorite series for that Doctor. Doctor #8 had only one show.  The Colin Baker selection, ""Vengeance on Varos"", is one of my top 10 Classic Doctor Who stories. In addition to being a good science fiction story, it comments on the human condition - Are we are no different from the Roman mob gleefully giving thumbs down to a gladiator as our afternoon entertainment?

5th  DOCTOR - PETER DAVISON (1982 -1984)
The Special commentators include Peter Davison, Steven Moffat, Hugh Bonneville (appears in 2 episodes in the modern series), Sarah Sutton (plays Nyssa), Mark Strickson (plays Turlough), David Tennant (plays the 10th Doctor), Nicola Bryant (plays Peri), Janet Fielding (plays Tegan), Marcus Wilson (series producer), Matthew Waterhouse (plays Adric) and Noel Clarke (plays Mickey Smith).
Fielding compares Davison's Doctor to the previous Doctors: ""There was clearly a decision to show him as much more emotionally engaged, and therefore he was bound to be more vulnerable.""

This special is followed by the series, ""Earthshock"" (1982).
It's the year 2526 on planet Earth. Eight scientists went down to survey a set of caves, and Professor Kyle is the only one who made it out alive. She returns to the caverns accompanied by soldiers, to collect her colleagues' bodies and find the murderers.

Nearby, the TARDIS lands in the caverns. The Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa exit to find that the walls contain fossilized dinosaur bones. Nyssa, not from Earth, asks, ""How could such a successful species die out so quickly?""
The Doctor: ""Initially, hypothermia, then starvation.""
Nyssa: ""Caused by what? An ice age?""
Doctor: ""The Earth collided with something from space.""
Tegan: ""An asteroid?""
Doctor: ""I don't know. I've always meant to slip back and find out.""

The science lesson is interrupted when the soldiers arrive and assume the Doctor is the murderer. They realize differently when two faceless androids start shooting at all of them. It's not until the very last minute of episode 1 that we see the culprits - it's the Cybermen!  The Doctor needs to save his favorite planet, and maybe he'll find out what killed the dinosaurs.

6th  DOCTOR - COLIN BAKER (1984 -1986)
The Special commentators include Marcus Wilson, Colin Baker, Steven Moffat, Nicholas Briggs (voice of the Daleks), Bonnie Langford (plays companion Mel) and Nicola Bryant. I thought this was the best Doctor Revisited Special yet, made more interesting because this Doctor could be brash and unlikeable. He may be the only Doctor who tried to strangle a companion, and he IS the only one to fix the TARDIS' Chameleon Circuit. Finally, the TARDIS could appear as something other than a blue Police Box!

This special is followed by the series, ""Vengeance on Varos"" (1985).
Once again, the TARDIS has problems and stalls, just like a car, in the middle of deep space. In the meanwhile, there's disturbing happenings on the planet Varos. The Varos Governor is in negotiations with Sil, the Galatron Mining Corporation representative. The Corporation mines the metal Zeiton-7 on Varos. It's an almost worthless ore, Sil reminds the Governor, and the corporation does Varos a favor to even bother at all. But the Governor holds out for a higher price.

Unfortunately for the Governor, his boss, the Chief Officer, is in cahoots with Sil. The end result is that the stoic Governor loses a vote of confidence, and the whole planet watches a live broadcast of his torture.

Back to the Doctor, who tells fellow traveler, Perpugilliam ""Peri"" Brown, that he's figured out what's wrong with the TARDIS. It needs Zeiton-7, an exceptionally rare metal that is found on only one planet. Exceptionally rare and valuable? The TARDIS limps over to Varos, lands near the torture entertainment stage, and the fun begins.

This episode is so well done. Sil, played with sibilant arrogance by Nabil Shaban, is a perfect bad guy. Eeeew, you just want to pour salt on him!

7TH  DOCTOR - SYLVESTER MCCOY (1987 - 1988)
The Special commentators are Sylvester McCoy, Marcus Wilson, Sophie Aldred (plays Ace), Bonnie Langford, Tom MacRae (writer ""The Girl Who Waited""), Nicholas Briggs and Steven Moffat.
Ace is a great companion. I tend to forget that she was just a teenager. Moffat says, ""Traditionally, ... the girls were for screaming. But not with the Doctor and Ace. She provides the muscle.... She blows stuff up, she doesn't scream and she clobbers people.""

This special is followed by the action-packed series, ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" (1988). The series starts with a brilliant, subtle intro. We view Earth from space and can hear snippets of historic 1963 radio broadcasts, such as John F. Kennedy, ""We all inhabit this small planet"" and Martin Luther King, ""I have a dream"". And then, as we pull back from further from the planet, we see a giant spaceship approaching Earth. An invasion in 1963?

The Doctor and Ace land in 1963, too, near 76 Totter's Lane, where the very first Doctor Who episode ""An Unearthly Child"" took place. It was on that 1st visit that the Doctor hid a powerful Time Lord relic. He's come back to retrieve it, and somebody else is trying to get it, too.

The Doctor invites himself into a black surveillance van, and Professor Rachel Jensen is impressed enough with his knowledge that she takes Ace and the Doctor along when she races to a 2nd source of trouble. It's a junkyard where the military, under Group Captain Gilmore, is trying to smoke out ""a hostile"" hiding in a shed. The Doctor tries to warn them that their weapons won't work against this adversary: ""You're not dealing with human beings here.""
Group Captain: ""What am I dealing with? Little green men?""
Doctor: ""No. Little green blobs in bonded polycarbite armor.""

It's a Dalek! What is one Dalek doing hiding in a shed by itself? Now the plot gets convoluted. It turns out there are Imperial Daleks and Renegade Daleks and they don't like each other one bit. Can the Doctor use that antagonism? And don't forget that creepy little girl we saw back at the school.  She'll be baaaack.

8TH  DOCTOR - PAUL MCGANN (1996)
The Special commentators are Daphne Ashbrook (plays Grace Holloway), Steven Moffat, Marcus Wilson, Yee Jee Tso (plays Chang Lee), Sylvester McCoy and Nicholas Briggs. The Narrator says, ""It was the 1990's. TV was ruled by Mulder and Skully. But for one night only, Doctor Who came back.""

This special is followed by the 90 minute American made-for-TV movie, ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" (1996).  The DVD will include the movie in two formats: widescreen & feature-length, and in its episodic original format.

In the introductory sequence, we learn that the Master was tried and executed on Skaro for his crimes. His last request was that the Doctor take his remains back to Gallifrey. ""It was a request they should never have granted."" But that's hindsight.  The 7th Doctor (played once again by Sylvester McCoy) is en route to Gallifrey, when something goes wrong and the TARDIS performs an emergency landing. It's San Francisco, Earth, New Year's Eve, 1999.

The Doctor exits the TARDIS, unaware that a slithery creature leaves its hiding place and follows him.  Fortuitously, the TARDIS landing saves a young man, Chang Lee, from a gangland execution. Un-fortuitously, the rival gang shoots the Doctor instead.

The Doctor is rushed to the hospital. It's not the bullets that kill him. It's the renowned heart surgeon, Grace Holloway, because she doesn't realize he has two hearts. In the morgue drawer (conveniently upsized), the Doctor regenerates.

Meanwhile, the snakey creature hitches a ride home with the ambulance driver. Poor man, he'll never snore again. The snake goes in through his mouth and takes over his body. It's the Master, and his borrowed body won't hold up for long. He's used up all of his Time Lord regenerations. His only option is to steal the Doctor's remaining lives.

The Doctor doesn't have to just save himself. As he tells Grace, ""The Eye of Harmony has opened. If I don't close it, get my TARDIS and the Master off this planet, this planet will no longer exist.""

For all that I like Paul McGann's Doctor, I can see why this movie didn't fireball-ignite a Doctor Who comeback. It doesn't have the charm of the Classic Doctors and suffers from American excess substituting for better dialogue. Why the Master's demonic eyes? He never needed them before. [Added later:  See Comment added to review by Grady Glover. I was wrong, there is a reason for the demonic eyes!]

If you are a newbie to Classic Doctor Who, you might be puzzled by a line where the Doctor says he is half human. This has never come up again, and most fans explain it away as hyperbole or figurative.

But though it's not my favorite, McMann's movie is still a 4-star Doctor Who for me. And there is good humor, such as a sequence with the poor morgue attendant, trying to explain to Grace how her very dead 2-hearted John Doe busted out.

NOTE: In promotional blurbs, the documentaries of each Doctor are described as being 40 minutes each. When I've timed them on my cable's OnDemand, though, they've been of varying shorter lengths. Give or take a minute, the Specials for the four Doctors in this set, including commercials and Moffat's special introduction, range from 25 to 31 minutes each.

5837744,4,B00DNQKF2G,"In 2014, I made a goal for myself...to watch all 50 years of Doctor Who; every available serial, episode, movie, and special...and I gave myself one year to do it. It took eight months, but I eventually achieved my goal, and just in time for the 50th anniversary special. I then decided to buy/own my absolute favorite serials/episodes from each Doctor, and these were some of them.

This DVD contains a famous serial/story from the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Doctors, and conviently, each one of them are my favorite stories from each Doctor's run (I guess there's a reason they chose these stories to feature in the ""Revisited"" specials).  The stories include:

EARTHSHOCK:  The Fifth Doctor and his friends investigate the mysterious disappearance of an archaeological team, only to discover the Cybermen want to destroy Earth, and will use any means at their disposal. Although the Tardis team saves the day, their victory comes at a VERY high cost.  The Cybermen were always my favorite Who villains (even more than the Daleks), and the Doctor's speech to them about the importance of emotions and being human is particularly memorable.  The dissapearing minors in Part One is effectively creepy, and the story's final end is beyond shocking.

VENGEANCE ON VAROS:  The Sixth Doctor and his companion, Peri, are cruising along through the galaxy, when the Tardis stalls out and is floating loose in space. The nearest planet is Varos, which happens to be a source of the mineral needed to get the ship moving again. But Varos is plagued by a severe food shortage, and if any planet resident tries to rebel against the evil Chief Officer, that rebel is tortured on live TV broadcast into every resident's home. The Tardis team must then navigate the hateful place that Varos is, get their hands on some precious minerals to reboot the ship, and help some of the planet's residents overthrow the evil Chief Officer.  The Sixth Doctor was, argueably, the least popular of all the Doctors, but none the less, he's at the top of his game in this one.  The other side villain, Sil, is an effective slime ball (literally), who, despite being a greedy jerk, is fun to watch.  This whole story is sort of like a precursor to the Hunger Games.

REMEMBERANCE OF THE DALEKS:  The Seventh Doctor arrives in 1960's London with his companion, Ace, and the two get caught in the crossfire of two Dalek factions, who are engaged in a deadly search for the Hand of Omega.  This is pretty much a no holds barred fight between the Doctor and the Daleks, while also presenting an allegory for the racist tensions at the time (white Daleks vs. black Daleks). Two memorable scenes include the Doctor mocking the Dalek leader's ""I'm going to take over the world"" speech, and Ace beating up a Dalek with a baseball bat.

and finally, DOCTOR WHO: THE MOVIE:  The Seventh Doctor is returning home to Gallifrey with the remains of his arch-nemesis, the Master. Forced off course, the Tardis arrives in San Francisco on New Years Eve 1999, where the Doctor is critically wounded in a gangland gun battle. At the local hospital, Dr. Grace Holloway fights--and fails--to save his life. Later, in the morgue, the Doctor comes back to life in his Eighth regeneration. But he is not the only one--the Master has also found himself a new body. As the clock counts down to the start of the new millennium, the Doctor and his new companions must stop the Master from destroying all life on Earth.  This was the Eighth Doctor's only adventure, and it was a TV movie pilot made in an attempt to relaunch the show in America. Treating it just as a pilot, with no prior knowledge of the show, it isn't that great, as there's alot of things left unexplained unless you've watched the show before.  But if you HAVE seen the show before, and just treat it as another story/adventure, it's pretty decent. Paul McGann does a really nice job as the Doctor, and it's a shame this was his only outing, because he showed alot of potential here.  The steampunk-ish redesign of the inside of the Tardis is also pretty cool.

The picture quality on all the discs are excellent, however, there's really nothing in the way of special features. The only extra stuff is a quick biography/behind the scenes history/recap of each Doctor that's about a half hour long each (and these played before the serials when they aired on TV).  That, and it gives you the option to either watch each episode of each serial seperately, or edited together as one, big, long movie as it aired on TV.

This DVD is pretty good as a starting point, if you want to get a friend into Doctor Who and teach them more about the show. And even if you ARE a long time fan, this is a nice way of having a bunch of the best stories all in one set.",1430092800,7,4773,4.643705463182898

5837755,4,B00DNQKF2G,"Though I would have preferred ""Caves of Androzani"" as Peter Davison's selection, ""Earthshock"" is a worthy alternative and is doubly notable as companion Adric's death episode.  The format here is to summarize each of these Doctors eras in individual featurettes and then show a story for each, presumably their signature story though fans, like me, could quibble.  The most notable of the bunch is the Doctor Who movie starring Paul McGann, his only appearance in the classic era as the Doctor ( or more accurately, the bridge era between classic and new Who).  The movie has even greater significance post-50th Anniversary, as McGann's Doctor was given an epic send-off and star turn in the magnificent ""Night of the Doctor"" prequel to the ""Day of the Doctor"" special anniversary story.  Had the show been in production in the Nineties, McGann would have been a very magical Doctor indeed.  Colin Baker is also underappreciated as a Doctor, number 6, and is now rehabilitated by fans as having been the victim of poor scripts and uninspired production in his time.  He is a larger than life actor and gives the role in enthusiasm and intelligence what it lacks in stories and support.  There are also surpisingly poignant moments in Sylvester McCoy's Dalek story, another of the Who Doctors let down by a show rudderless and and on the BBC's bad side.  All in all, this DVD release is a very good example of this era of Doctor Who, the middle years, if you will, and is well worth the price to own.",1402704000,5,1499,4.760617760617761

5837760,4,B00DNQKF2G,"Dr. Who is a little like James Bond.

Not just because it is another British show which has been around about 50 years, but because the title character has been played by multiple actors over those five decades. Unlike Bond, where they don't really even acknowledge the changes, each of the actors playing the time-traveling alien called Dr. Who is considered a different ""regeneration,"" with the changes receiving some fanfare and each version of the doctor displaying different traits and personalities, even though they're all ostensibly the same character.

The Doctor Revisited is a nice way to learn more about each of the different incarnations of Dr. Who. This second set covers Doctors five through eight, played by Peter Davison (1981-1984), Colin Baker (1984-1986), Sylvester McCoy (1987-1989), and Paul McGann (1996). There's four disks in the set with each containing a half-hour synopsis and a representative episode from one doctor. Originally aired on the BBC as part of the show's 50th anniversary celebration, each synopsis is similarly organized with the same narrative subheads and cover what made each doctor unique, who their ""Tardis Team"" companions were, as well as the major villains they faced.

I first started watching Dr. Who with Doctor four, Tom Baker, so when Peter Davison came along next, I stuck around and saw many of those episodes as well. It is noted that Davison was not only a well-known actor prior to this stint, he was also the youngest person to play the Doctor up to that point. Costumed in an antique cricket outfit with a stalk of celery attached to his lapel (which they never explain), he's young and dashing, but less self-consciously eccentric than his predecessor. He can and does go from sweet and innocent to steely resolve very quickly. Throughout his time on the show, he's surrounded by a bevy of young, good-looking companions, including the orphan Nyssa, Australian hothead Tegan, the child genius Adric, and later the slightly edgy Turlough, who was originally sent to assassinate the doctor. It caused quite shock at the time when one of these characters departed the show dramatically with a heroic death. Davison's time on the show also brought the return of redesigned Cybermen and new bouts with the renegade Time Lord, The Master.

Sixth Doctor Colin Baker was intended as the antithesis of Davison. His large and loud personality demands attention and is highly unpredictable, at least at first when the storyline has him highly disturbed by his regeneration. He even tries to strangle his companion. ""As terrifying as he is heroic and as dangerous as he is lovable"" is the way the documentary puts it. He also comes off as an arrogant and impatient showoff and his over-the-top colorful costume reflects his state of mind. American botanist Peri Brown, who also leaves the show in a shocking way, and fitness nut Malanie ""Mel"" Bush, are the doctor's companions during this doctor's time. Villains facing this doctor include the pugnacious Sontarans, who are much larger than they are in the revamped Doctor Who series of late, and midget businessman Sil, who represents the interests of big business in outer space.

Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy is sometimes comedic and even vaudevillian (he plays the spoons and does magic tricks), but he also has darker and more sinister moments and he ruthlessly manipulates both his enemies and his companions. At times, he reminds me of someone's scheming uncle. His costume seems pretty ordinary except for the question marks on his sweater and umbrella handle, which seem to indicate his inquiring mind. In addition to Mel, this doctor's other companion is tomboy teenager Ace, who makes her own explosives and in one episode famously attacks a Dalek with a baseball bat. Villains faced by McCoy's Doctor include a new breed of Dalek and a renegade female Time Lord called The Rani. More recently, I was happy to see McCoy show up as the eccentric wizard Radagast the Brown in Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies.

Until he was brought back for a very short online prequel to the 50th anniversary special in late 2013, McGann's time as the Doctor was limited to an American-made two-hour, made-for-television movie, which aired in 1996 and failed to revive the series. The movie was set on New Year's Eve 1999 in San Francisco and the Doctor has to thwart The Master's nefarious plan to take over his body, his Tardis, and the world. It should be noted that because it was actually filmed in Vancouver, this City by the Bay doesn't really look much like San Francisco.) The filmmakers cram a lot of ""Who-ness"" and background for uninitiated American viewers into this two hours and the documentary comments that McGann is very much a ""reset Doctor"" aimed at giving a new audience an idea of what the character is like. At the beginning, there's a glimpse of McCoy's Doctor and a Tardis which looks homier than it's ever seemed before. While his performance is short, McGann's Doctor is sensitive, exuberant, dynamic, physical, and even romantic, as the telefilm includes the character's first on-screen kiss. I don't like that the documentary gives no background on McGann and neither he nor Eric Roberts, who plays The Master, appear in the documentary. Instead, we get  Yee Jee Tso, who played Chang Lee, and Daphne Ashbrook, who played Grace Holloway, providing commentary. Ultimately, McGann's Doctor seems like a great start that never went anywhere, and it would be another nine years until the character was revived again.",1391731200,3,5536,5.017410228509249

5837765,5,B00DNQKF2G,"For many folks in my generation, it was somewhere during this era of Doctor Who that we were all introduced to the adventurous Time Lord. Starting in 1981, the run of Doctors five through eight carries fans right up to the reboot with Christopher Eccleston appearing as number nine. There were massive changes to be seen in these two decades (well, one decade really, there was quite a long break between 89 and 96.) Fashions changed, companions changed, and as usual the Doctor changed faces, but underneath it all he always stayed the irreplaceable character fans were emotionally tethered to through all those years.

'The Doctors Revisited  Five Through Eight' brings out some truly memorable representations of the Doctor. We see Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann all take a swing, with varying takes on the character and varying levels of success according to the fanbase. The box set includes a full story for each actor, plus a documentary talking about their time in the role and the people who tagged along for the ride. And what it ride it was.

Starting off with Peter Davison (1981-1984) we got a new, younger and much more dashing Doctor. He was the youngest actor to play him yet and to some it was a play to bring in more female viewers. Whatever the motive, Davison was much more than a pretty face in a blue box. In the story included for him, 'Earthshock', Davison also presided over the menacing return of the Cybermen, one of the Doctors long-standing and most unstoppable foes. This story also resulted in one of the most shocking twists of the show to date, in the death of a main character (which Ill keep to myself so youll be forced to check it out for yourself.)

Following him is Colin Baker (1984-1986) and the difference between him and Davison couldn't be more stark. Baker was brash, arrogant, abrasive and in the beginning generally angry over his regeneration. The show took a more violent turn and brought a truly dark edge to the role. In fact it was so dark that the BBC put the show on an 18-month hiatus complaining that the violence was too prominent. The story included in this set, 'Vengence On Varos', really doesnt pled the pacifist case well either. The Doctor uses a gun (not normal for todays incarnations), burns two soldiers alive with acid and generally doesnt play well with others. Also, the storyline gives a truly open look at the motivations of the audience, challenging them to say violence is bad while being glued to their screens watching it. Subtext is truly king in these episodes.

Next in line is Sylvester McCoy (1987-1989, 1996) who may look quite daffy and particularly reminiscent of Patrick Troughton (2nd Doctor), but there was a continuing depth brought out underneath the slapstick and vaudevillian characteristics he displayed. McCoy knew magic, which he showed off in various episodes, and early on seemed to find any reason to bring out his spoons for a brief musical interlude. Yet McCoy felt strongly about revealing the sadness and despair of being a character who was over nine hundred years old. Think of the people hes left behind, those lost to the annals of time, while he marches ever onward. That pathos is most definitely honored in the more recent incarnations and I don't believe the current show would be at all the same (or as good) without that direction from way back.

His story, 'The Remembrance of the Daleks', brings back once again the most famous of his arch-enemies, but I will admit if there is one thing these older episodes suffer from is the lack of quality CGI and special effects. When a Daleks head wobbles when it moves because the costume is not correctly fitting together, its pretty hard to be scared of them.

One scene in a diner with a lonely and pensive Doctor, there is a cameo that I was really thrilled by. Joseph Marcell played the late night counter clerk and while the name might not ring a bell, most people would surely recognize him by the role he came to play years later as Geoffrey Butler in 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' (seriously, did anyone know the butlers last name was Butler?)

This brings us to the final role handover in 1996. The show had been off the air for over six years and there was no sign of it ever coming back, so the BBC gave the rights over to an American company for them to make a TV movie for the audience stateside. Paul McGann jumped in those ever-growing shoes and absolutely knocked it out of the park. The most tragic thing in his run is that he only got to do it this one time. One TV movie, aptly titled 'Doctor Who: The Movie', and that was all we got, which once you watch it youll see why its such a terrible loss. He nails the charm, wittiness and affability in one ninety minute movie, making you think hed been in the role for years.

Taking on the antagonist cape this time is Eric Roberts (of 'Best of the Best' fame) who becomes the evil renegade Time Lord, The Master. Snakelike, venomous and played up like a classic nineties villain, Roberts does not disappoint. On the downside, the documentary for McGann is fairly limited and mostly redundant after watching the movie because theres no other footage to pull from.

For the Whovians out there, lets face it, you need to have this in your collections. It features some great behind the scenes tidbits and some real classic on-screen stories that will not let down the true fans and maybe even pick up one or two along the way.",1389744000,,5473,4.63298969072165

Then Peter Davison (The Fifth Dr.) came on & he became MY Doctor. I actually consider Baker & Davison my 2 Doctors, but Davison will always have my heart(s)! Colin Baker, although disliked by many, was likeable to me! Sylvester McCoy re-visited the 'whimsical' nature that was a reminder of Patrick Troughton's Second Dr., & I loved him. Then in 1989, after the Final Story ""Survival"" aired, Doctor Who was gone...until 1996 when Paul McGann was hired to play the Eighth Dr. for a Revived Series on FOX. Even Sly McCoy returned so we could see the actual Regeneration (we've seen ALL of The Doctor's Regenerations)! But alas,that ' Series Hopeful' didn't pan out either. Until 2005 when BBC brought the show back in full-force & it's success still rides high today, which brings me to my main point. Although I'm happy that whole new generations are discovering Doctor Who, all people today seem to know, or talk about is the Revived Series, i.e., 2005-Present! BBC's decision to commerate the 50th Anniversary of the show by releasing ""The Doctors Revisited"" 1-4, 5-8, & 9-11 was GENIUS! I own dozens of Doctor Who DVDs in my Film Library...the majority of being Baker & Davison's Stories. When I 1st saw this on amazon.com, I was intrigued. I thought that it was just a Retrospective Documentary of each Doctor--5-8, in this case, but when I found out that there was a Complete Story included in this 4-Disc Set, I had to look further. & what do you know? I didn't own any of the 4 Stories on the Set! I placed my order @ once, but what I actually GOT exceeded all of my already high expectations! The Retrospectives are AMAZING, w/ all  of the Doctors (w/ the exception of McGann) being interviewed, along w/ the Companions! Each Documentary is 30 minutes long & followed by the appropriate Dr.'s Story, shown in 2 viewing options; A) a Feature Cut w/ an Introduction by current Showrunner Setven Moffat. & B) the Broadcast Versions, divided up into the seperate Episodes (that's MY choice, as that's how I grew up w/ the show). This DVD BoxSet is NOT just for fans getting accustomed to Classic Dr. Who, it's also for the die-hards, like myself. Personally, I've only seen 3 Stories of the 2005-Present show. Really don't wish to see anymore for now. I'll buy ...""Revisited 1-4"", b/c I haven't any of those particular Stories on Disc eiither, & I LOVE the Retrospectives, but I won't be purchasing ""...Revisited 9-11"" anytime soon.

8595234,4,B00DNQKF2G,"Dr. Who The Doctors Revisited Part 2

This second 4-disc set samples doctors 5 through 8 of the old series for those who never watched it or want to reminisce.  I was particularly interested in Doctor 7 played by Sylvester McCoy from 1987-89, as I first met him as Rhadagast in The Hobbit and saw that hes a superb and entertaining actor.

Doctor 5 is Peter Davison from 1981-84. The episode on disc is Earthshock, which was originally shown in 4 parts in 1982.  While Western society was becoming familiar with the concept of alternative families, this Doctor Who accumulated his own alternative family from a hodge podge of places.  By the time Earthshock ran, the Tardis was getting rather crowded with a cast of 4 [2 males and 2 females].  The producers decided the ranks needed to be thinned a bit, so in this episode the young lad Adric is removed from the storyline by heroically saving the earth, but being blown up in a space ship packed with explosives.  That was a shocker for fans as a companion had never been killed off in show before this!
This story is set several centuries in earths future.  The villains here are Cybermen, who had not appeared for seven [actual] years.  Its a sad commentary on acting, dialog and directing when the robotic enemies are some of the best characters.  The acting of the humans in this episode is just terrible.  I also found this Doctors outfit frankly ludicrous and borderline offensive.  For some reason he decides a cricketers outfit under a full length, yellow jacket with red trim would strike the right look.  NOT!  He also has perhaps the most passive and inadequate personality of the various Doctors Ive viewed so far.  I ended  up having to skim through some of this episode as it just didn't hold my attention adequately.

Doctor 6 is a slight improvement as played by Colin Baker.  His outfit is even more extravagantly colorful than Davidsons, but its actually an improvement.  Instead of looking like a dallying dronelike Lord [play on words intended], he just looks bizarre enough to be believably alien.  This story is ""Vengeance on Varos"", written by a quite good screen writer who had done documentaries before this change of pace.  The story is meant to say something about totalitarian societies and pandering to mans worst instincts.  Naturally the Doctor and friends have to shake up this soulless culture.  Again however, the dialog, action, pacing etc. did not adequately hold my interest.

At last, Doctor 7: Sylvester McCoy.  His episode is Remembrance of the Daleks, an intriguing title.  I never was quite sure why this title.  Needless to say, the infamous Daleks [ex..termin..ATE!!! :-) ] are the baddies here, but they are Daleks with a difference.  This line of Daleks reappears later in Tennets period, Doctor 10.  McCoys human side kick is a young lady from what we in the States call the wrong side of the tracks, a misfit and an angry rebel before the Doctor takes her under his wing.  This pair plays differently from most Doctor-human dyads, because Ace [played by Sophie Aldred] is quite the scrapper and the Doctor truly relies on her to help him keep the upper hand against these Daleks.  The plot is complex as there are two different factions of Dalek, the humans [some helping the Daleks and others fighting against them for mankind] plus the Doctor and Ace.  McCoys Doctor underwent an interesting transformation over his episodes, starting out quite comedic but in later episodes, as depicted in this multi episode story, having a significant darker side too.  McCoy in addition to his fine acting skills and his great comedy, is also dexterous and his Doctor sometimes performs actual magic tricks, plays spoons like a musical instrument, and generally keeps the audience guessing what hes going to do next.  Apart from the crude special effects along the line of killer B sci-fi movies, this was definitely better than the first two discs.

Finally disc four shows us Doctor 8 played by Paul McGann.  This surely is the most uncharacteristic Dr. Who story ever produced.  It is the only Doctor Who story for the whole decade of the 1990s.  It was made as a TV movie not a series.  The story is just titled, Dr. Who-The Movie.  It was made in America rather than Great Britain.  I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, but the acting was generally quite good especially compared to many earlier episodes Ive seen.  The special effects and set designs were also a quantum leap better than most of what came before, as befits a movie.  The episode begins with Sylvester McCoy, the prior doctor, and shows his regeneration into Mc Cann.  The setting is San Francisco at the turn of the millennium: December 31, 1999 [although it aired in 1996, so when it came out it was set a few years in the future].  The arch-enemy is The Master.  The plot has the Doctor taking the remains of the Master back to their home planet of Gallifrey for burial.  Unknown to the Doctor the Master hasuhmastered a method of keeping his soul alive a while without a humanoid body.  It appears as a snakelike creature.  The Master manages to divert the Tardis to earth, where he intends to steal the Doctors body and continue living out his quest for power.

Theres the making of real drama here as the Doctor initially [after his regeneration into McGann] doesnt even remember who he is.  He has to simultaneously recall his true identity and thwart the Masters plans which, if carried out, will mean not just the end of the good Doctor forever, of course but all of planet earth as well.  Then lets throw in a romantic interest with a female surgeon and a redemption story with a young Asian gang member, who initially is duped by the Master but later realizes he needs to switch allegiance to the Doctor.  This is probably the strongest romance plot of any episode I've seen to date.  Each Dr. Who season seems to borrow concepts from other popular sci-fi shows [nothing surprising as every writer and director make use of what's already in the culture and tries to extend it in an interesting way] and in this one The Master has some resemblance to the Terminator, although he is not a cyborg.  This movie is played with only small touches of humor.  Romance is the main sub-theme and the suspense dominates.  The Doctor ends up in what appears a completely hopeless situation before things turn around.  The story line for The Master in this movie is not fully compatible with the Master as portrayed in later years, and there are places where the plot really strains continuity and credibility.  If you determine to just sit back and enjoy rather than demanding consistency and credibility, this is certainly the most entertaining of the four stories in this package.  Any fan of Dr. Who from whenever and wherever should see this movie.  Overall I give the package a B.  Like the entire series, the four episodes in this package get sequentially better as you go along.  The disc artwork is attractive.  Do not bother with the introduction, especially to Dr. Who-The Movie as it has nothing interesting to convey about character, filming or anythingit simply details the plot in minute detail, therefore being a massive half-hour spoiler!",1460592000,,7218,4.756234915526951
