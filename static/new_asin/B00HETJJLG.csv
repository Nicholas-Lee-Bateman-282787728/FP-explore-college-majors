6160622,4,B00HETJJLG,"Let me begin by saying that Robert Mitchum is my favorite actor of all time so it's difficult for me not to give this item 5 stars. However, I don't feel that the films chosen for this set are necessarily the ones that should have been. Where is Thunder Road? Where is Cape Fear? They could have picked films that better portrayed Mitchums acting. I had to buy two separate Robert Mitchum sets to get the films i wanted plus i still have to buy Cape Fear separately.  But of course i gave this 4 stars because Mitchum is always great no matter what.",1411689600,32,549,4.278846153846154
6160623,4,B00HETJJLG,The case is similar in design and as durable as ones costing much more. I am pleased with the style as well as the function,1475280000,,123,3.96
6160624,4,B00HETJJLG,Robert Mitchum what can you say other than he is an excellent actor,1474848000,,67,4.230769230769231
6160625,5,B00HETJJLG,"Four great movies from 1947 to 1960 with one of my favorite actors, the legendary Robert Mitchum, along with a host of great actors and actresses of all time.  A thrifty buy and well worth it for many enjoyable hours spent with Mitchum, Jane Greer, Kirk Douglas, Deborah Keer, George Peppard, Jean Simmons, Eleanor Powell to name a few.  Grab some popcorn!  Sit back!  Enjoy!",1470873600,,375,4.723076923076923
6160626,4,B00HETJJLG,"It would be tough to chose just 4 Bob Mitchum movies from the many good to great that he made in his time.  He is one of those true actors that plays the character as the writer or director envisioned, instead of just being himself.  There are a few actors that have a certain personality that is pleasant and endearing to folks and makes them feel comfortable.  Mitchum, is not in a film to make you feel comfortable watching good ol' Bob, he is there to BE the character, good, bad, likable, or despised.  A great actor that needs to have a full collection of all of his films offered, not just four.",1469059200,2,602,4.300884955752212

6160629,2,B00HETJJLG,"It's a little more than two stars and a little less than three.  If you LOVE film noir, then two of the films are just for you, Angel Face and Out of the Past.  Classic film noir done well.  Sundowners is really just okay.  Deborah Kerr has no business being in Sundowners.  Most of the accents in this film don't ring true.  The sheep shearing is probably the most entertaining part of the movie.  Home from the hill has good performances from the young stars, George Peppard and George Hamilton.  Eleanor Parker doesn't know how to give a bad performance.  It's a quirky film, I liked it, but don't know that I need to see it again.  Don't really need to see any of these again, if I'm being honest.  Robert Mitchum has a lot of better films under his belt than these, but for under $11.00 for the four of them, it's worth the price.  If you are a film noir buff, then this set is a bargain.",1465603200,4,893,4.218934911242603

6160647,4,B00HETJJLG,"Though only two of the movies are strong, in my opinion, they're more than worth the price -- you can toss the other two and it's still a great buy.

I'd always known Out of the Past to be one of the all-time great noirs, and it remains so (and was later remade into Against All Odds). But I'd never seen Angel Face, and what a superb noir that is as well. After watching it the first time, I then watched it with the commentary on and what an amazing back story (or back stories, there are so many) behind this impressive film!

If you like noir, you'll love these two gems!",1442707200,18,575,4.125
6160648,4,B00HETJJLG,Another great addition to my movie collection. My wife and I are enjoying watching these movies. Thank you!!!,1442534400,2,109,5.111111111111111
6160649,5,B00HETJJLG,"Robert Mitchum is one of my favorites.  Out of the past is thrilling.  Love his toughness, acting was great.  He was very underrated by the Hollywood community.  I watch these films frequently and see something new each time.  I really enjoyed his pairing with Deborah Kerr in several of his movies.  He can be tough but also very sweet.",1442534400,11,337,4.627118644067797

6160654,5,B00HETJJLG,If you like film noir movies you will like this four movie set that includes two great ones. Out Of The Past was my favorite of the two film noir ones and was worth the cost alone.,1437264000,7,180,3.891891891891892
6160655,5,B00HETJJLG,How do you beat Michum? Especially love the commentaries tied to the film noir films. Highly recommend this collection if you are a fan of Robert Mitchum.,1436140800,7,154,4.7407407407407405
6160656,5,B00HETJJLG,"Robert Mitchum's varied career is shown to great effect with this 4 movie collection with ""Out of the Past"" and ""The Sundowners"" two magnificent classics while""Angel Face"", directed by Otto Preminger and ""Home from the Hill"" are very fine, the latter is George Peppard's first big break in films  and is a family western directed by Vincente Minnelli in beautiful Cinemascope and Technicolor. This collection is a must if you love Mitchum or want to learn why so many people did.",1435190400,28,479,4.91358024691358

8632101,5,B00HETJJLG,Robert Mitchum in Out of The Past was great in this film with Jane Greer and Kirk Douglas! I enjoyed all the others as well! Check out an old film of his in Maria's Lovers with Nataska Kinsky ( unsure of the spelling of her name!) It's interesting.,1497225600,,248,4.1875
