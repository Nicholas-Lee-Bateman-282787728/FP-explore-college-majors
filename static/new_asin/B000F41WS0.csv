8117175,3,B000F41WS0,"I've started some Dill's Atlantic pumpkins indoors, and they're doing great. Being a first time grower of the giant pumpkins, I've been looking for how-to information to learn how to get the largest possible pumpkins.

This is the first DVD I've seen on how to grow giant pumpkins, and I like the format--it provides a visual viewpoint that is missing from printed material. However, it is filmed like a home video, with lots of jittery motion and a few exposure problems, so it can be difficult to view.

Jim presents in a nice friendly manner, but the material does not appear to be scripted in any way, so details are missing and the information is not well organized.

For example, Jim talks about trimming every-other side shoot, but never shows the process. In another scene he is talking about fertilizing and pest control behind a counter that is stacked with products, but he never formally introduces the products or specifically details the application regimen.

I think some extra planning could have made a huge difference in the quality and value of this DVD. If you looking for step-by-step info with lots of details you may be disappointed with this product. I'm not aware of many other DVD options on this topic, however, so if you want some insights from a proven champion pumpkin grower, adjust your expectations and enjoy the show.",1239321600,2,1351,4.8354978354978355
