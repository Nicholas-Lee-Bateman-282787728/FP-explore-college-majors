Similar but contrapuntal to A Nos Amours, a contemporaneous French initiation film with Sandrine Bonnaire also as a confused growing girl. Isabelle and Sandrine teamed up in 1994 for Claude Chabrol's Le Ceremonie, a modern-day loose adaptation of the 1933 Papin sisters' murderous rage.",1473120000,,412,5.555555555555555

Well, at least a good-looking version of the movie is finally available on dvd. Hopefully this print will get subtitled and released in the US or UK someday.",1432166400,,295,5.166666666666667
8187637,1,B000OY6I9E,"Whoever authored this crappy DVD ought to be taken out and shot.  I love this film and bought the DVD. The DVD froze a half hour into the film. It was a used copy, so I thought that there might be a tiny nick in the surface of the DVD. A year later I bought another copy - same thing.  What a shame that a great film was released as an unwatchable DVD! Don't waste your money on this Koch Lorber piece of crap. Maybe someday Criterion will release this classic. Until then, VHS is about the only hard copy that is useable.",1356566400,,522,4.058252427184466
8187638,4,B000OY6I9E,"Based upon a true story, an impoverished young girl, Violette Noziere (Isabelle Huppert), lives in a suffocating little flat in Paris with her parents.  She habitually sneaks out of her home to engage in sexually promiscuous behavior.  She has loving parents.  Her father and mother are sweet, affectionate, simple people. Her father, Baptiste, played by Jean Carmet is a retired railroad engineer.  His greatest joy is simply playing cards with his wife, Germaine(played by Stephane Audran), with Violette in attendance.

Unknown to her parents, at the ripe age of 18, Violette keeps a room in another part of Paris for liaisons with young men as a prostitute. Violette gets syphilis from an unknown client. She discovers from a medical student that the disease can be inherited and is able to convince her parents that it has happened in her case. Her parents never consult the doctor who made the diagnosis.  This would be incredible except that this movie is based upon a true story and they obviously prefer their daughter's version of the truth more than finding out for themselves.

Violette eventually falls desperately in love with a young man she meets in a bar named Jean Dabin (Jean-Francois Garreaud). Her ""love"" for this handsome yet unambitious young man finally unleashes the psychopathy which she has manifested with smaller bad acts earlier in the movie. It leads her to use her earnings as a prostitute to buy him suits, watches, and has her aspire to marry him.  She even steals her father's ring to give it to him as a present.  Dabin takes all of the bounty Violette provides him but remains totally emotionally uninvolved, leaving for the countryside.

While Dabin is gone Violette resolves that the only way to have him is to kill her parents and steal their savings. Violette uses packets of medicine supposedly prescribed by the doctor to treat the family's non-existent disease. In fact she is poisoning the parents. She engages in a grisly sociopathic feast after her attempted killing of her parents. Throughout the movie director Claude Chabrol uses flashbacks to create a purposeful confusion as to what is true and what is false in Violette's later version of events when she is arrested and tried for the murder of her father and the attempted murder of her mother.  The murder set off a true hysteria in France as the country tried to cope with a case of unfeeling and unprecedented parricide in 1933.

Huppert was only twenty-five when she made this movie. Director Claude Chabrol dressed her in black dress, hat and coat in the best tradition of the femme fatale.  But it did not take a lot of creative genius to do it. Her dress duplicates the dress of the real Violette you will find in the news of that day. This was the first of a number of films upon which Chabrol and Huppert collaborated.  You can see the brilliance of one of France's greatest actresses in the making in this early film.  It is chilling because it is real. A true Edgar Allen Poe horror story you will enjoy.",1336867200,2,3019,4.789980732177264
8187639,4,B000OY6I9E,"First let me tell you. I own the Koch-Lorber DVD version of this film. It is a terrible transfer. The picture quality is shockingly bad and the film is in 1.33:1 (but should probably be in 1.66:1, or even more than that). This is, unfortunately, the only DVD of the film with English subtitles, that I know off.

The film is based on the true story about Violette Nozire, and takes place in 1934. Violette, a teenager, plays the innocent young girl at home but spends her days and nights with men who desire her. Her life becomes complicated when she is diagnosed with syphilis and has to acquire a lot of money to keep her latest lover happy.

Violette is the first of many films Chabrol made with Isabelle Huppert in the lead (others include Story of Women, Madame Bovary, La crmonie and The Swindle). Isabelle Huppert is amazing in her role and it is mesmerising to watch her go from being so sexy and cold woman to an innocent and warm child. This is a dark and difficult drama, which tries to stay away from taking sides, but rather shows the mystery.

SPOILERS! Violette kills her father and defends herself by alleging that he had molested her. Chabrol's never tells us whether Violette is lying or not. Also was she always so cold or is she like this because she was molested by her father (if that happened at all) or is this personality changes do to syphilis? We are never told.

I gave the film 8/10",1275696000,2,1411,4.436293436293436
8187640,5,B000OY6I9E,"Violette Noizzere is a striking and devastating portrait based on real facts about a girl with a weird behavior due unsaid tragic events in her early adolescence. That sexual abuse will cause a fatal and ruthless vengeance with unpredictable consequences.

The amazing performance of Isabelle Huppert (one of my five beloved French actress ever) deserved her the Golden Bear Prize in Berlin 1976.",1248048000,2,396,5.285714285714286
