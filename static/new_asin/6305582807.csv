7893936,3,6305582807,"The film offered a respectable mystery plot, with lots of unexpected twists, right up to the end.
However, as another reviewer has already noted, the fight scenes were filmed ""off-center,"" clipped, or at strange camera angles, which I found for the most part distracting, removing most of the impact that these scenes might otherwise have offered.  For example, it wasn't unusual to see most of the figure of one of the fighters, but perhaps only the hand or foot of his opponent, in many of the fight scenes.
I bought this film on DVD.  The quality of the video and audio transfer is o.k., considering what the producers probably had to work with (without digitally re-mastering).  Being a die-hard kung-fu movie fan, I will no doubt watch The Massive again, but will store it on my second or third shelf.",1043971200,,806,4.742857142857143
7893937,4,6305582807,"This is the same movie as "" Murder of Murders "". The original Chinese title of the movie is "" The Jade Dragonfly "". Story is about six stolen jems by the famous ""Jade Dragonfly"". The police  head who was conducting the search turns out to be the one who stole the  six jems from the Jade Dragonfly. Good story and an interesting movie.",961286400,2,335,4.21875
7893938,3,6305582807,"This movie is pretty good, the story, and the fighting. The picture is not the greatest but at least you get chapter selection. The end fight between the hero and villian is pretty good. In which you see the twisting spear of  hate vs. the nine section sword! This is a must have for your Wu Tang DVD  Collection.",955756800,,313,4.288135593220339
