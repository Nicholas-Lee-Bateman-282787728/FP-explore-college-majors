8479117,1,B000KJTCG4,Very boring video.  I only watched three minutes of it before I could not take any more.,1424304000,,88,4.176470588235294
8479118,1,B000KJTCG4,"Had this been what i hoped for, this could have been great.  It is a warmed over, poor production that was obvioulsy made as a promo video for different USC athletes, and not for commercial value.  It should have been a dramatic revisit to athletes across the decades that brought unique highlights to USC football.  Could have used been great...it isn't.  Worth about the price that the used market has for it.",1173571200,2,411,4.666666666666667
8479119,1,B000KJTCG4,OTC The Legends of the USC Trojans appears to be a junior high school attempt at a sports documentary. The menu items do not work properly and some of the video appears to be a digitized version of a television recording. The volume of the music was inconsistent and competed with the monotone voice of the announcer. The text scrolling across the bottom of the screen was a major distraction to the video highlights.,1173398400,2,417,4.648648648648648
