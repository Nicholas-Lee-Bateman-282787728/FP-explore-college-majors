4331057,4,B004CZZZTA,"This review will center more on the quality of the video then of the film.

But, I would like to say that although obviously a ""B"" movie, I feel it's it has more to offer then many give it credit for. I thought it had some interesting moments. I did feel some of the dialog was a bit over the top but, overall, to me, it was an entertaining film, with some chilling moments (pun intended?)

Now looking at the cover art, you might feel this looks like a bootleg, however, don't let that scare you, this has a pristine sharp image. The film grain is pretty much intact, but this doesn't distract from an excellent overall look. If you've ever seen some of the copies floating around on different sites in the past, you'll truly appreciate how it this version looks.

The audio (mono) is equally crisp. Background sounds such as NASA background was very clean. I was surprised by this as I've never heard the movie this way before.

The only extra is the trailer which is likewise crisp and is interesting to watch.

The only downside is that because of the nice transfer, the stock footage is very VERY evident, but to fans of this period of science fiction, this will no doubt be quite acceptable.

If you are a fan of this film and have any fear of how it will look, have no fear. Go for it!

The title I gave  my review is from a line in the trailer.

I give this 4 stars mainly due to a lack of any extras and it being a DVD+R. A trend that seems a bit unfortunate, however, the silver lining is that this format may result in more of the obscure titles being released since there is no need to stock up on copies without knowing it if they'll sell.

If you aren't much into extras, this is about as good as it gets.

SUPPLEMENT - I did notice one thing as I watched this again. (I've also noticed it on a couple of other DVD-R movies I've seen as well). At the end of some movies, the recording seems to stop just shy (maybe only a couple of seconds or so, maybe even less) of the ACTUAL end. This abrupt cutoff IS noticeable. If anyone who makes these recordings ever sees this review, I would ask that they make sure the movie is COMPLETELY faded out before stopping the recording.

This is not enough of a problem to make me alter the overall feel I have for this DVD. Definitely still 4 stars. I just thought it was noticeable enough to be worth mentioning.",1325462400,25,2365,4.242761692650334

4331059,4,B004CZZZTA,"I really enjoy discovering ""new"" old science fiction movies that I've never seen before. One such movie is ""12 to the Moon.""

Consider the state of spaceflight when ""12 to the Moon"" came out in 1959. The Space Age, kicked off by the Soviet Union's launch of the first man-made satellite Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, had barely been born. A mere handful of primitive satellites were in orbit, and no human had flown in space. We knew very little about conditions on the moon. Scientists hotly debated whether its craters were meteorite impacts or volcanoes. As a historical snapshot rather than a ""how-to"" spaceflight movie, ""12 to the Moon"" reflects fairly well the technical and scientific knowledge of its day. It seems incredibly cheesy and nave today, but it's not bad when viewed as a record of the time it was made.

On the pro side of the ledger, most of the scenes on the moon are excellent. The sets are stark and hostile, with dramatic, low-angle lighting that looks a lot like sunlight in vacuum. The crisp, sharp video transfer adds to the grittiness. Yes, the ""mountains"" and ""craters"" are rougher and more jagged than we now know them to be, but virtually every other ""moon movie"" at the time made the same mistake. The ship ""Lunar Eagle 1"" is not a bad design, with details that make it look like a real object, not just a movie prop. The spacesuits are U.S. Air Force S-1-style partial-pressure suits that would  have been useless on the moon, but they add a touch of techno-realism to the proceedings, even with their ""invisible ray-screen"" faceplates instead of glass. The interior sets are reasonably well-equipped with gauges, gadgets and gimmicks, including lawn chairs that served as acceleration couches (hey, it was a low-budget movie, okay?).

The stock footage of rocket launches was mostly okay, although in one scene the rocket is a Thor rather than the Atlas that appears in most places. Audiences in 1959 wouldn't have known an Atlas or a Thor from a wheel of Jarlsberg cheese, and mixing stock footage of rocket launches was common in genre films of the period. Die-hard space geeks will enjoy the little ""cameo"" of Convair Test Conductor Curt Johnston, with his trademark string tie, in the blockhouse during the launch of Atlas 10-B SCORE on December 18, 1958.

On the minus side--well, while the 12 people on the flight were supposed to be an international crew, too many of the actors did nothing but stand around. A cast of three or four crewmembers would have been much more manageable, and would have tightened up the script considerably. Speaking of scripts--it's pretty bad, really. Other reviewers have summarized it, and I can only add that I think it fails in being too ambitious. A lot happens in 72 minutes, which means nothing gets enough detail to make sense, or to make compelling drama. Literally within three minutes of the end, several plot points remained unresolved. That the filmmakers attempted to tie them all up indicates how shallow the treatment is. A simpler plot and fewer actors could have made ""12 to the Moon"" a better picture.

But, all things considered, it's not bad. It's good enough that it will not be in my public library donation pile any time soon, and I'll probably watch it again occasionally. You'd never confuse it with great entertainment, but, considered as a historical document, it's quite watchable.",1394928000,5,3382,4.822413793103448
4331060,5,B004CZZZTA,this is a classic I haven't seen in years. It is a very worthy movie for its day. the effects of the time were great. I love it . thanks,1391385600,,136,3.566666666666667
4331061,4,B004CZZZTA,"Despite being a huge fan of 50's and 60's sci-fi movies, I somehow missed this one until it showed up on Turner Classic Movies a few years back.  Now, Columbia offers up a very nice print of this rare movie, and, for the most part, that's great news for us classic sci-fi fans.

Serious science-fiction films during the heyday of drive-in ""b"" films were pretty rare.  The decade got off to a great start with films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destination-Moon/dp/B000YSO9WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destination Moon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-The-Earth-Stood-Still-1951/dp/B000UL5YWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)</a>.  But the greater part of the 1950's gave us giant critters, alien invaders, and interstellar voyages that were far heavy on FICTION than SCIENCE.  So it's refreshing to find 12 TO THE MOON at the end of that decade, offering another thoughtful--in its own limited way--exploration of cosmic themes [Spoilers Ahead].

A truly international crew sets off to explore the moon, and find nothing but trouble when they get there.  But I give the writers credit for the crew idea, coming near the end of the Cold War.  Sure, everyone speaks fluent English, and there's never any doubt that the American Guy is in charge.  And while the 2 female crew members offer solid contributions to the team, an early scene of them showering (very chaste, don't get excited) seems a bit out-of-place.  Predictably, some prejudices surface, most notably between a German scientist and a crew member of apparent Jewish origin.

You want aliens?  Well, you'll get them. . .sort of.  The never-seen ""moon people"" communicate with the crew through a series of Chinese writings.  And while this is never mentioned, I think it's kinda cool because even in the late 50's, China had the largest population on Earth.  So might an alien race not assume that Chinese was the dominant language?  There's also the idea that the human race might not be the ONLY race on Earth worth studying: One of the few requests made of the crew is that they leave behind the pair of cats brought along for ""procreation"" experiments (although the felines' fate, as well of that of two crew members left behind, is left to the viewer's imagination).

As far as the A/V quality, I think it's safe to assume there will never be a better presentation of the film.  I viewed this on a Blu-ray player and 70"" HDTV, and the image was very sharp throughout.  Only a handful of stock footage scenes, and some unconvincing paintings during the ""big freeze"" finale lean toward the grainy side.  The mono soundtrack is very clear as well.  The DVD also includes the film's terrific theatrical trailer, which looks as good as the film itself.

Even if you're a big fan of the genre like I am, there's a good chance this rare film has eluded you.  I'll stop short of calling it a classic, but it IS a very well-made film that offers up an intelligent story, earnest performances, and good (if thrifty) effects.  Definitely recommended.",1379548800,5,3150,5.254

4331064,3,B004CZZZTA,"Made during the height of the space race in the early 1960s, TWELVE TO THE MOON offers an advertisement for international cooperation, not only between the Americans and the Russians, but between members of all nations.  An anti-Cold War statement, the film is now notable for the presence of some interesting actors in the cast, notably Tom Conway (George Sanders' brother) playing a Russian, and the Turkish actor Muzaffer Tema (in his only English language film) playing a Turkish astronaut.  The plot is hackneyed, but the film is an interesting curiosity nonetheless.",1353888000,,572,5.206521739130435

4331066,3,B004CZZZTA,"Warning: spoiler!  This film was made after Russia's two dogs in space flights, which are referenced in the script by the one Russian crew member, but before any manned flights in 1961.  It has the international idealism of the period, though some of the crew members have enough emotional baggage you wonder how they made the team to begin with.  The moon inhabitants are never seen.  After capturing two crew members for study, and demanding two lab animals to be left behind as well, they warn off the crew thinking that the daily bombardment of the moon by meteorites has been inflicted by the earth instead of being a natural phenomena.  When the crew re-enters earth orbit, the moon puts the North American continent into a deep freeze.  After two crew members make the ultimate sacrifice to return the climate to normal, the moon people decide that we can be friends in the future after all.",1337817600,14,898,4.7243589743589745

8424367,5,B004CZZZTA,"12 TO THE MOON -- one of those dopey, implausible-beyond-belief, so-utterly-moronic-it's-actually-WONDERFUL sci-fi thrillers, to whose series of preposterous events and fatuous dialogue you'll doubtless enjoy emitting one eyebrow-raising groan after another.  BUT, guess what, film score aficionados...

Right from the beginning of this epic turkey (and thereafter), I kept hearing musical passages that sounded as though they could only have been written by my beloved Miklos Rozsa. If film score music -- *especially* by Rozsa -- is ""your thing,"" you can imagine how enthralled I was. Going back to the credits, I discovered that the score to 12 TO THE MOON was written by Michael Andersen -- a composer, up until now, completely unknown to me. Looking Andersen up on imdb.com, I discovered, both to my amazement and delight, that Andersen actually studied with (and was no doubt influenced by) none other than Miklos Rozsa himself.

I realize this ""revelation"" will come across as an inconsequential trifle to most folks; however, for those of you reading this who wish to hear a bit of ""Rozsa"" written by someone else, this is one of those films you'll want to get ahold of immediately.",1441670400,,1190,5.1875

8424369,5,B004CZZZTA,"They certainly don't make them like this anymore!  Love the story, they cram a lot of doctors into a rocket and send them to the moon.  Along the way, they deal with angry sentiments from a Russian scientist and endure a Nazi rant from another.  They have an old geezer onboard and a whiz-kid better than a calculator.  Naturally, there are women as well as a standard loony/saboteur.  They land on the moon and quickly learn that it's made of kitty litter.  The craters look like giant barnacles (love the production values!).  Their helmets don't have face plates because they have been replaced with super-duper magic invisible force field thingies that keeps the air in.  They quickly claim the moon for ""everyone,"" incurring the wrath of the local inhabitants who saw it as a form of trespass.  These invisible moon-people kidnap a pair of lovebirds dumb enough to remove their helmets because they discovered a cave filled with air!!!  The others find gold and an EVIL stone they take onboard their vessel.  They receive a ransom note of sorts and told to get out.....but leave the cats behind (they didn't want the dog or the simians).  And just because they could, the invisible moon-people fast-freeze the U.S. (that'll teach us to interfere).  Hilarious.  Great fun.",1438819200,,1276,4.874418604651162

8424371,4,B004CZZZTA,"THOUGHTS: Surprisingly literate and thought-provoking sci-fi from a period when most films of this kind were bone-headed cheese fests. That's not to say that 12 TO THE MOON doesn't have its share of the chewy yellow product. It gets most of the science wrong and there are classic cornball scenarios, such as the mandatory ""maneuvering through a sudden meteor storm"" sequence that 99.9% of 1950's & 60's space operas have. That said, the real lure of this film is the respectful (for the most part) treatment it has for the concept of such an undertaking. This flight is basically an international, jointly funded & overseen project; sort of a United Nations space journey. Each member of the team represents the best & brightest of his or her country. In another burst of forward thinking on the part of the cerebral script, the two crew women are legitimate scientists in their own right, rather than the typical bosomy, beehive hairdo babes that giggle, fetch coffee for the men and bite their knuckles & scream. Surprising to see a crew that's comprised not only of male & female members but features a black actor in a prominent, dramatically meaty role, instead of the usual dim-witted Stepin Fetchit/Mantan Moreland comedy relief character we are often subjected to in films from that era. In fact, a sure sign that this isn't your typical 50's/60's outer space movie is that there is no comedy relief character or ""amusing"" moments to be found anywhere in this film. Very refreshing.

The script is imminently pithy in comparison to other product from the same time period. It almost comes across like an episode of Outer Limits or classic Star Trek. I had never seen or even heard of this film until I happened across it on the W-B Archives sight. I figured it would be another silly but fun ""Queen of Outer Space"" / ""Missile To The Moon"" type flick and took a chance... and was very pleasantly surprised at how seriously straightforward and good it actually was. Even my wife, who usually finds such stuff silly and boring, was pulled in and found herself watching all the way through. The actors here range from veterans to new faces I hadn't seen before (or since). As such, the acting talent runs the gambit from competently believable to stiff as a plank. The sets were pretty much what you've seen in many other such space flicks from the time, although they did maintain some verisimilitude with multiple levels tied to a central ladder up the middle of the ship. Speaking of which, the ship ""Lunar Eagle-1"" itself is quite familiar to outer space films, yet a step above most other miniatures. (At times I got the feeling that the film may have been filmed on the same interior spaceship sets as ""IT, THE TERROR FROM OUTER SPACE"" with only minor re-dressing, and I'm still not sure this in fact wasn't the case.) Thankfully, the producers of 12 TO THE MOON don't subject us to yet another stock footage V12 rocket launch to depict lift off, but treat us to a newly-lensed sequence that's pretty well executed. The brief scenes of the Lunar Eagle zipping through space are obvious double exposures, as the Christmas tree light stars are clearly seen bleeding through the fuselage of the ship, but these are kept to a minimum. Besides, after seeing so many similar shots in countless other space flicks, I'm pretty immune to it and almost expect it. The tail exhaust is full, believable and nicely-rendered, by the way. The lunar surface looks cool though, again, mostly incorrect. Since man hadn't been there yet when this was made, it was all obviously guesswork on the part of the writers & set designers. They threw in some wildly inaccurate rock formations that resembled corral reefs, deadly pumice stone quicksand pits, and oxygen-filled caves of ice. Silly, but cool.

The dangers to our crew and the resolution of said threats are surprisingly respectful to an adult viewer's intelligence. This was clearly not just a kiddie programmer film designed to fill the second half of a double feature bill. Kudos to the writers for having the courage to propose such advanced concepts, and doubly so to the production company & crew that stayed faithful to those ideas and saw them through. In some ways 12 TO THE MOON has much the same in common with the earlier DESTINATION MOON, albeit with a slightly more fantastical approach and, sadly, far fewer resources with which to pull it off. Still, this largely unknown film is well worth your time if you're a fan of this genre. It doesn't have styrofoam spider puppets or stunt men waddling about in rubber monster costumes (dog gone it!) but it is still very entertaining in its own way.

THE DVD: 12 TO THE MOON is one of those Columbia Pictures DVD-r deals, so be warned that older video players may have trouble with it. I've never had any issues with any DVD-r films from W-B Archives (where I bought this), but I've read of those who have, so buyer beware. The only bonus feature on the disc is the theatrical trailer. BOTTOM LINE: 12 TO THE MOON is a fun, engaging and decidedly non-typical adult entry in the time-honored Exploration Of Space genre of science fiction films. Its level-headed, non-sensationalistic approach to the fantastical subject matter gives this sci-fier a moderate-to-high replay value. If you can snag it used for cheap it's well worth it. 4 STARS!",1426896000,,5347,4.778378378378378
