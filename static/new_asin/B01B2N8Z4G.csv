8749122,5,B01B2N8Z4G,Very interesting and useful for the already knowledgeable martial artist.  I wouldn't recommend for a beginner unless they want to know what Kajubendo is all about by showing the practical application 'on the street' presentation but would be difficult for a beginner to learn from. To practice and present in street clothes and environment and following through to the 'end' of a threat shows the real intent and practical application of Kajukenbo.  I thought it was very good and almost like watching an action movie and waiting to see what's going to happen next. For the initiated you can compare what you know and what you may want to incorporate into your system.,1483315200,3,669,4.911504424778761
8749123,4,B01B2N8Z4G,"I'm a American Kenpo instructor for many years. I'm adding more advanced kenpo technqiues for fourth degree black. Kajukenbo was created by a Kenpo guy with added knowledge from a few other arts. I'm picking and choosing moves that I can incorporate in fourth degree. I get ideas, modify things and so on. It's not for a beginner, but someone trained in martial arts would learn new stuff here and there on the DVD.",1462665600,4,415,4.621621621621622
