8549603,5,B00AB2O11G,"I'm from New Castle, PA where the movie was shot. I missed it when it was in the theater and have been looking for a copy of the DVD for awhile now.

The acting is pretty good. It can be a little slow at times, but I think it fits the movie. I wouldn't consider it an action movie, more of a dark drama. The setting for the movie couldn't have been better, not because I was born in New Castle, but because New Castle is a drab and dark place especially in the winter when this movie is set. I watched it twice the night I got it. It was fun picking out people I knew and what places were shown.
