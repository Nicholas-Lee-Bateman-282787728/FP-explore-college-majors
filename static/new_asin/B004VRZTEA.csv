8443963,2,B004VRZTEA,"YOU CANNOT WATCH IN USA!

I don't know if we missed this on the description, but when we put the DVD into three different players (including a computer, DVD, PS4) we received the same encrypted error code -- this are only available to view in Europe. Super unfortunate because we were so excited when we received the DVDs!",1508976000,,322,4.551724137931035
8443964,5,B004VRZTEA,"Series 1 and 2 of this particular version is the best movie that matches the books. I feel it's the more dignified version of the series. It's not a cartoon nor a comedy. It portrays the British lifestyle in this imaginary story which is why I enjoyed it so.  The quaint lifestyles with proper manners and respect. The realistic family with it's imaginary living conditions. How they have such sweet family names. I think this one is closely more of what the author had attempted. I wish they had the American DVD. I saw this show on BBC in the states and couldn't wait to buy it. I attempted to tape it on VHS but it was from the TV and it didn't tape as clearly as it was seen on TV. I've tried to see if the libraries have it but no one does. I don't know if a UK DVD player would work over here even if we had adapters.  But, I want this movie for my library and can't seem to find away to purchase one I can use here.",1460592000,,922,4.032786885245901

8443966,5,B004VRZTEA,"In the states this was known as ""The Return of the Borrowers"". I know, I bought the VHS of ""The Return of the Borrowers"" just in case. They are the same thing.",1434844800,,159,4.0
8443967,2,B004VRZTEA,lousy picture quality---very grainy--sound is below standard --surprising since it is BBC production... I was very disappointed with this DVD and now I understand why it was so inexpensive,1371081600,,188,5.517241379310345
8443968,5,B004VRZTEA,"The Borrowers-Series Two is beautifully done. The actors interact like a real family,without exaggerated costumes or makeup.
I would recommend this film for all ages.",1360281600,,166,5.68
