3719414,1,B001NJY698,"I am trying to watch this show and have been trying to tonight, but it is so boring and uninteresting, I am not surprised so few people even know about this show, it is absolutely forgettable and totally a waste of time, DC should just stick with the known superhero's or create better new ones that will actually interest people and are more original and interesting. The concept of the show has possible substance, but a failed execution for a kids animated TV show.

3719415,4,B001NJY698,Being that it was a spin-off from Batman Beyond which I love I bought this wondering what it would be like.  It was a decent show and very kid friendly but didn't develop the characters very much or resolve itself.  It had great potential but didn't use it.,1393459200,2,257,4.333333333333333
3719416,5,B001NJY698,"I loved Batman Beyond, it was dark, gritty, tough and one of the best episodes introduced a robot, Zeta.  For those that don't know Zeta is part of the Greek alphabet, it's the 6th letter and based on the show Zeta is the 6th model of robot that the government of the future designed to assassinate someone, and you thought drones were bad.  This particular killer robot, however, like so many robots we've come to love, grows a conscience and decides that killing is bad; throw in a snappy, streetwise teenage girl, and you have a show.
Done in the same animation style as Batman Beyond but with a more upbeat and kid friendly hue, Zeta looks great, the writing is solid, or at least as solid as shows like this could be in those days, and the only disappointment that I have with the show is that because of bad sales they are not going to release season 2.  For that I think angry letters should be written to Warner Bros. but that's just me.  Still, fun show, great for the kids and adults alike, clever, funny, what's not to like?

3719421,3,B001NJY698,"I never caught Zeta when it aired, but I was introduced to the show through Batman Beyond, the series it spun off from.  The DVD heavily touts this association stating 'From the World of Batman Beyond' with 2 Bonus Episodes from BB featuring Zeta.

Despite coming from the same universe, Zeta has a completely different tone.  There's a few episodes that I really enjoyed, like Taffy Time, where a bounty hunter lures Zeta into a trap using Agent Lee as bait, and Ro's Reunion was a good one.  My least favorite episodes usually involved annoying kid genius Bucky, who tags along on 3 adventures.  I liked the introduction of the upgraded model that Zeta attempts to stop from carrying out an assassination but then returns, setting his sights on Zeta.  This one reminded me of Terminator.  Batman makes a guest appearance in that one, but it felt more like a ratings grab than actually having a good reason to write him into the show.

The featurette about making the show is OK, the most interesting fact being that Robert  Goodman originally created the show to be even darker than Batman Beyond but Kids WB forced them to make it more juvenile and target a younger audience.  I would have liked to seen what it could have been had it taken a more serious tone seeing as some of the eps are pretty silly at times, but the show still works based on the strength of the concept and the fact that it's pretty action oriented.

I would have preferred if they had put all the season one eps on here (it's missing Absolute Zero) as opposed to giving us the Bonus Batman eps which have been previously released.  It's a shame that this season didn't sell better because it means the chance of Season 2 releasing is slim and I would have liked to continue the series.",1245196800,14,1762,4.523659305993691
3719422,5,B001NJY698,"This show is fun. Not very original, but fun. It is one of those great shows that are safe for kids, but parents can sit and watch with them.

The series follows Zeta (Nicknamed Zee), a robot trying to find his creator. He is helped by a girl named Ro, who teaches him about humans.

The main draw of the series is the interaction between the witty and sarcastic Ro, and the easily confused Zee. The action is also exciting.

As a fan of the DC animated universe, it is also cool to see the expanded world of Batman Beyond.

This is only the first half of the show, hopefully it will sell enough to warrant a second release. I highly recommend it to fans of cartoons, Batman Beyond, and parents who want a quality series for their kids that won't drive them nuts.",1237852800,10,763,4.277777777777778

8327228,4,B001NJY698,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this largely unknown and forgotten spin-off of ""Batman Beyond.""  To be honest, I was basically unaware of its existence until recently--and I'm glad I discovered it, so that I could add it to my DCAU collection. (For the uninitiated, the DCAU--aka ""Timmverse""--is the long running shared continuity first established in ""Batman: The Animated Series"" in the 1990's, ""Superman: The Animated Series,"" ""Justice League,"" and ""Justice League: Unlimited,"" as well as several DC animated films, and the stylish retro-futuristic series, ""Batman Beyond."")  ""The Zeta Project"" is a direct spin-off of ""Batman Beyond,"" and like its progenitor, it is a DC property that did not begin as a comic book, but as a creation specifically for television.  I could be wrong, but I'm unaware of Zeta *ever* spilling over into the comics afterwards, which Batman Beyond did--as did Harley Quinn (Batman TAS), as we all know.  Although, set in the same futuristic world as ""Batman Beyond"" (the titular character, Zeta, was introduced in an episode of Batman Beyond), the adventures of the android, Zeta, and his human female sidekick, Ro Rowan, don't even feel like a ""comic book"" or DC series, per se.  It's pretty well a straight forward sci-fi action-adventure--and you wouldn't even know that it's related to the DC universe, except for when ""Batman Beyond's"" Terry McGinnis and old man Bruce Wayne show up for a single crossover episode in the second half of the season.  The rest of the time, ""The Zeta Project"" stands completely on its own as a serialized adventure in which Zeta (a runaway android being hunted by the government) and Ro (a street smart young woman who grew up as an orphan) watch each other's backs as they both try to unravel the mysteries of their pasts.  It shares a similar retro-futuristic art style with Batman Beyond, although not the same shadowy darkness (after all, it's not set in Gotham); it's colorful and bright--with a much more kid friendly feel.

I've seen some snarky comments regarding the fact that it is mostly geared towards younger viewers (as in younger that the Batman Beyond audience)--to which I say, ""So what?""  If you're going to disparage a show that aired on ""Kids' WB"" just because it's aimed at, well, kids...then you might want to recheck your own maturity.  Yes, it's aimed at kids and yet it's still very enjoyable for adults with well written stories and even a few bits of racy humor that that you *hope* gets past the kids.  There is more than a hint of romantic tension between the two leads.  Furthermore, some of the stories are actually quite (tonally) dark and intense for a kids' show--and that's when you begin to remember that this actually is set in the gritty world of Batman.  It's a wholly underrated gem in the DCAU and should be a part of every completest's collection...or you can simply enjoy this series on its own (and be surprised with Batman shows up).

There are some oddities to mention.  One is a continuity oddity between this series and ""Batman Beyond.""  When Zeta was first introduced in ""Batman Beyond,"" he had a different appearance, most notably his head.  In his initial BB appearance, Zeta had a strange U-shaped head.  Once he got his own spin-off series, Zeta had a more humanoid-shaped head (a definite improvement in his appearance).  The change is never referenced on screen, so we either have to assume that's what he always looked like (a retcon) or conjecture an in-universe explanation that he built himself a more aesthetically pleasing head--which would be consistent with his character and he would have the technical know-how.  I rather subscribe to the later.  When Zeta and Ro guest starred on a later episode of Batman Beyond, Zeta still had his ""new"" head and appearance from his own series.  Another oddity is the very odd and annoying comic relief character, Agent West--a young rookie government agent who is so incompetent, even his fellow agents ignore him.  He isn't funny at all--just annoying as hell.  His partner, however, a female Korean-American, Agent Lee, is competent, likable, and compassionate.

The final oddity is the DVD set itself (and this is where I knock off one star on what would otherwise be a perfect five).  The series is short--only twenty six episodes in total, spread across two very brief seasons--and yet this set is only Season 1 (13 episodes).  You have have to buy Season 2 separately--and they're a little pricey as set.  Compare that to the ""Batman Beyond"" box set, which comes as a complete series, all 52 episodes in one.  Furthermore, the strangest thing is that they come directly from Warner Brothers (this is a legitimate studio release, not a bootleg), and yet these over-priced discs are not even ""real"" DVD's.  Instead, they are cheaply burned DVD-R's which makes me a little concerned how long they will last over time without degrading--as well as limiting the sorts of machines that can play them.  That said, they played flawlessly on my Sony blu-ray player with excellent picture and sound.  I figure as long as I take proper care of them, they should be fine...hopefully.  I'm looking forward to cracking open Season 2!",1519430400,,5191,4.923076923076923
8327229,1,B001NJY698,"This series would earn a gold star if it were a middle-school project. On the other hand, if you're not a judge of middle-school projects, you should not have to go through the pain of watching it. Look, we all love the Timmverse and want to extend our fix. But this -- this is not worth it. Every aspect of it is fairly awful. So take my advice and spare yourself the pain.",1507680000,,374,4.136986301369863

8327236,3,B001NJY698,"The first couple of episodes are fine, but after that they verge too much on the line of cornball and implausible plots. I mean, there's actually an episode in which Zee(the titular robot) has to rescue a little girl that has wondered into the open door of a museum's nuclear reactor exhibit. That's right, we're supposed to believe that a museum in the future actually has a fully functioning nuclear reactor as an exhibit, and that it hires people stupid enough to leave the door into core open. Even for a kids' show, that's pushing it. That said, it is a nice way to expand the world of Batman Beyond, and it actually incorporates some of the characters from that show into its own DNA. So, if you're really into that show or are a DCAU completionist, then this is probably a worth the purchase.",1408320000,,799,4.517241379310345
