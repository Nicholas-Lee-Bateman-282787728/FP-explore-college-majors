6729296,4,B00O8J0KUY,"In this gripping, 87 minute, color, single disc, DVD, comes a drama that you won't soon forget. With Dolby Digital Sound the depths of the sea... speak forth, through the vengence of an 85-foot sperm whale that deliberately rams a Nantucket whaling ship. On November 20, 1820 in the Southeast Pacific, the whaling ship named 'The Essex' was effortlessly splintered by the fury of a whale, whose mate they had previously killed. Cast adrift more than a 1000 miles from any land, they braved the cruel elements, as best as they could. But eventually, in addition to being exposed to the elements, unquenchable thirst, hunger to the point of cannibalism and madness, set in. Coping as best as they could, only 8 members of the entire crew, survived. Three months after the fact, they were rescued by a British whaling ship. This epic, true life drama inspired Author Herman Melville, who penned the renowned novel 'Moby Dick', based on this account. Actor Martin Sheen, stars. This short film is graphic and sobering. But it re-tells the true story of actual events. Nina Kish",1430265600,6,1073,4.868852459016393

6729298,5,B00O8J0KUY,"This 87 minute movie is based on the story of the whaling ship `The Essex'. Martin Sheen narrates as he remembers his voyage as cabin boy. `The Essex' sailed out of Nantucket to hunt whales in the Pacific. It was rammed and sunk by a whale, which in turn inspired Herman Melville's `Moby Dick'.

The film and story itself are engrossing. The actors do a credible job in telling the story of whalers on an ill-fated voyage. It is a good drama and also serves as an instructive film on what life was like on a whaling ship.

There is a warning that there might be some disturbing scenes and for some that can hold true, both during the cutting up of a harvested whale and during the time the crew was adrift waiting for rescue.
Those who like films about the sea and sailing ships and especially that of whalers will enjoy this DVD. There are English subtitles, but no extras.",1425081600,7,874,4.388888888888889

3 STARS FOR SOME MODEST INACCURACIES

On August 12, 1819, the whaling ship Essex left Nantucket on what was expected to be a two and a half year trip to whale off the west coast of South America.  The tragedies that would befall them were heard by Herman Melville decades later and became the inspiration for one of the greatest English novels.  This is not ""the real life tale"" of Moby Dick.  It is merely the real life tale of a huge whale that, according to the Essex crew, was somehow imbued with a sense of vengeance.  Melville seizes on that phenomena to create something much greater.  This story hardly discusses Melville and his novel.  Also, in an attempt to cover a huge adventure in just 87 minutes, some artistic license is taken and the story has some minor changes from the history of the Essex.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  The Essex sets sail from Nantucket and encounters a squall after just a few days underway.  There is some damage to one of the four whaling skiffs and another is lost completely (these are used to chase the whales when harpooning).  Captain Pollard was previously 1st mate, but is now on his maiden voyage as Captain of the ship.  Rather than turning around to make repairs, he orders the crew to carry on.  Through a series of events, tensions grow further and there is conflict as 1st mate Owen Chase questions Pollard's decisions.  After rounding Cape Horn in 1920, they head for whaling waters and find them somewhat fished out.  There is more grumbling as the crew awaits the chance for a payday.  Finally, two sperm whales are spotted and one is harvested.  Unfortunately for the Essex, the second whale is not going to let that slide!

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: (Minor spoilers, but this is history you may or may not already know)  The Essex was an aging ship by this final voyage and slightly undersized for a whaler.  The ship sustained slightly more damage in the initial storm than the show portrays and did in fact lose a topgallant sail.  This doesn't really change the story.  There were numerous unusual events that caused discontent among the crew and harbored a feeling of bad omen long before the attack.  The fire at Charles Island (set by one of the crew as a joke) would have been a dramatic inclusion to the film but was skipped.  When the Essex reached the fished out waters originally planned, they were directed by other whalers to try a different region.  I believe this was prior to the Charles Island incident.  The actual whale attack, which happened after two of the whaling skiffs successfully harpooned part of a whale pod, was actually much more dramatic than the movie portrays.  According to the 1st mate, another whale from the pod seemed to lay on its side so it could peer at the ship, then turned toward the ship and rammed it.  Adding to the sense of human like vengeance and malevolence, the whale actually continued to ram the ship until it was fatally damaged.  Unlike the movie, the whale then disappeared never to return.  In the movie, we see the whale continue its dark and doggedly vigil on the castaway crew  as they drift in the surviving skiffs.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  As a sailing adventure and a movie pointing us to the real occurrence of the wreck, I thought it was a great success.  The historical accuracy is sacrificed in small snippets for the supposed benefit of the dramatic interpretation.  Unfortunately, that drama is actually not as good as real life (at least according to sailor accounts).  The movie has nice flow and action, but still slows at points.  Yet I will still suggest that 15 minutes could have been added to the film and made it more exciting rather than less.  The historical accuracy could have been enhanced with that addition as well.",1424822400,21,3833,4.672645739910314

8682582,5,B00O8J0KUY,This is if you want to see some shipwrecked guys barely living and a survivor or two.  S*** happens....Since its a true story I thought deserved the best of ratings.  the writer is the head whaler and hes absolutely convinced that the whale managed to sink his boat to get revenge.  I have no idea at this time how many other whalers managed to get a kill in and survive if whales are able to defend themselves.,1447027200,,411,4.311688311688312
8682583,5,B00O8J0KUY,"As a boy I read the story of the Essex, a whale ship that was rammed by a large sperm whale and sank, stranding the crew 2,000 miles away for any land.  I was fascinated by their story of survival as the men did what they had to do to stay alive.  They made a few mistakes I their judgment, but this can only be said in hindsight.  They were closer to the Sandwich Islands, now Hawaii, than South America, but they feared cannibals and decided to head for South America.  This live action documentary made this story live again for me.  To see the whale striking the boat and watching it sink was very exciting.  The BBC always produces excellent live action documentaries.  The show weaves live action reenactments of the story mixed with narration of the events.  I enjoy history and found this program to be everything I wanted it to be.  It is well produced and filmed.  The film is a very accurate retelling of the wreck of the Essex.  The documentary left out the more grizzly parts of the story.  After hearing the story and talking to the captain, Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick.  History is fun.",1439769600,2,1121,4.436274509803922

8682585,3,B00O8J0KUY,"Interesting how, as the days and weeks go by everyone's beard is neatly trimmed, and the initial haircuts at the start of the voyage get a bit mussed, but no one starts to look shaggy. The makeup just makes them all look ashen or sunburned, depending on how close to death an individual might be. Still, the film is more accurate than the upcoming Ron Howard movie. Extra points for that in my book.",1438214400,,399,4.405405405405405
