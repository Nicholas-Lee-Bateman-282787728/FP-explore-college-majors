7822877,5,6302191696,"This video is so cute and magical! Of course, Princess Gigi's talking animal friends were Swellow, Lucario, and Purrloin. I thought she has talking Pokemon. But at least the song, ""Reach for your dreams,"" was fun.",1424476800,,213,4.944444444444445
7822878,5,6302191696,"I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl. Now I'm 27. But I never knew what this movie was called until coming to Amazon and finding it here. The down side is that you're watching this via VHS and the quality of the tape is old. And just like the VHS, it skips and fades in certain parts of the movie over time with age.
However, I wanted this movie to last a life time for me. I was so happy with finding this product that I bought it, shipped it straight to my Dad in Australia (I live in the States) and told him to make a DVD copy of it for myself and my brother. He kept the VHS, but sent one to me and my brother.

Don't let the title fool you though. This isn't some little girl, barbie fantasy world. This is something that people of every age can watch, even the boys. There's lots of action in it and fighting, but that action is child's fighting. Literally, a bunch of children that were once adults goes up against the armed forces and starts turning all the grown-ups into children. This whole movie is absolutely funny and will have you laughing, but it also has it's serious parts.

I now have this on DVD, and the recorder recorded just as the VHS showed; skips and fades in certain parts of the movie.",1291593600,2,1233,4.154811715481172
7822879,4,6302191696,The only Gigi movies I saw was on the internet and they did not speak English.  I'm glad they made this movie and I enjoyed it very much.  The part I liked the most was when Gigi sang that nice song of reaching for your dreams in the end.,1284076800,,238,3.836734693877551
