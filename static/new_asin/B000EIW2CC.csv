8110589,3,B000EIW2CC,"There are 2 VHS's for sale here--one has the bosom in a red lace bra and the other in white, but the info detail says they are both rated R and they both are listed as running 90 minutes.

As for the DVDs, there are 4 for sale--all from other regions, which means they are PAL discs and even though the runtimes are listed as 94 minutes that may be just the same as the 90min. version once you factor in the conversion.

I've heard some people mention that there is a RATED AND an UNRATED version of this, and obviously the UNRATED version is the way to go...but really, the info on here is so piecemeal it's a joke trying to figure out which one of these to buy!",1306108800,3,663,4.092307692307692
