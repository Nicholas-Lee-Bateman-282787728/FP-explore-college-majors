8710006,5,B00VG3NX7W,"TNT should have never cancelled this fantastic reboot.  It was a fantastic series with a lot of drama, twists, turns and new revelations.  Josh Henderson was terrific as JR and Sue Ellen's son and a worthy heir to the Ewing empire.  Linda Gray stole every scene she was in and never let fans of the classic series down.  I truly hope Netflex or a new network like Pop sees what TNT did not and bring it back on the air to continue the story.",1431475200,7,441,4.214285714285714
