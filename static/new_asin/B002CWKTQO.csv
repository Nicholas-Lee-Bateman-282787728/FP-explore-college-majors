8364566,5,B002CWKTQO,"The superheroe suit business sure is tough! This anime has lots of comedy, and a pretty good story too! The Galaxy federation police is trying super suits, and to give them a work out they have released a few super villans from prison to go up against. Poor Suzuo, looks like finaly finding a job in this terrible economic crisses, is about to get him killed! As long as Tampopo gets her contract with the GFP, she's not worried about it. Good thing the super villans are super goofy. It makes for one wild ride as they all have hidden identities both the competing heroes and the supervillans, and unknown to them they all live in the same apartment complex as neighbors, and even get along as freinds. Great show and the packaging is decent to.",1382400000,,746,4.492647058823529
8364567,5,B002CWKTQO,"This anime is about an intergalactic police force called the Galaxy Federation Police (GFP) that has decided to use power suits to fight crime. Two companies each try to sell the their power suit idea to the GFP. The GFP is not certain as to which power suit they want to use so they decide to have a test on Earth to see which suit would be better. The test consists of having the two companies each select a human to wear a suit and the GFP will select some of their imprisoned criminals, release them on Earth, and have them fight the power suit users with whatever means they choose. All members of this test are told to keep their identities a secret. This helps add to the comedy as none of the test members realize that when they are not constantly fighting each other, they are all enjoying each others company as neighbors as they are the only tenants of a small apartment complex.

If you do find this anime enjoyable, there is a three volume manga that this anime was created from:

8364569,5,B002CWKTQO,"This is perhaps one of the funniest series I have ever stumbled across.  A young man, named Suzuo, is given the job of a lifetime.  He is asked to test a power suit.  He ends up living in the same apartment building as his rival and arch nemesis.  Through befriending them in his secret identity and fighting them in the power suit, this series is nothing but comic misunderstandings and will keep you laughing in all twelve episodes.  Totally worth the buy!",1295222400,2,458,4.536585365853658
