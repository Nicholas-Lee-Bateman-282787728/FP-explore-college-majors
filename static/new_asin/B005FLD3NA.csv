8470208,1,B005FLD3NA,"The horror......the horror.......seriously the worst WWII movie I've ever seen, and I've seen lots. Just the laughable technical inaccuracies are breathtakingly bad. An M14 rifle? Really? Run from this turd, it's stinking up the place.",1359590400,2,235,5.742857142857143
8470209,1,B005FLD3NA,"I searched for something good to say about this.
1. The photography is professional.  Those who did the actual photography the film knew their trade. Not outstanding but good.
2. The black and white footage from the WW2 era brought back memories.
3. It's fairly short. (But the memories linger on to haunt your sleep)

Good contender for the worst attempt at movie making in the last 20 years.",1335052800,3,393,4.681159420289855
8470210,1,B005FLD3NA,"the reason there is no trailer is because this movie is horrible.  the acting is bad, the filming is bad,  it is the worst movie ever",1321056000,6,133,4.076923076923077
8470211,1,B005FLD3NA,"I am always looking for an under the radar war film that gets little coverage and surprises the lucky few that get to see it. In this case though, the few who do watch it will most likely be very disappointed. I went against all of the reviews out there hating this film, but in the end - I fell in line and cannot find any redeeming values - at all.

The story follows what seems like a verbatim scene-for-scene of Saving Private Ryan where a group of Normandy soldiers get to go behind enemy lines to get someone. But really, when the wardrobe, props, writing and acting are all so cheesy and laughable - it becomes difficult to eye with objectivity. The gun battle effects started getting so poor, you really hope for there to not be another. They interlaced black and white stock footage to make up for them not being able to budget filming certain sequences, but since there are no supplements to speak of, I am not sure.

The picture clarity is fine, the 5.1 is almost a joke and as stated before there are no supplements. No sense in trying to recommend this to anyone, but if you still have your doubts look for the other reviews out there and so far 100% of them are summarizing the same sentiment: please skip this. Phase 4 will have to work harder at getting higher quality military films.",1320537600,8,1300,4.390041493775934
