3487057,5,B001B97VCO,"like a roller coaster ride with a Spanish watercolor concierge, if that's not too rustic. I love seeing his bravura strokes, and it was as inspiring as it can be.",1356480000,7,162,4.433333333333334
3487058,5,B001B97VCO,I take this book everywhere! It is a great reference for painting city streets and buildings...with a limited palette and there are some decent exercises. His DVD is even better and I understand he is writing a new book and making another DVD. If you really want to learn his style get both his book and DVD. They are excellent.,1250208000,15,328,4.483333333333333

8282353,5,B001B97VCO,"I need to work on developing deep shadow areas in my painting, so I went to the master Alvaro.  This DVD is wonderful.  It's full of insights.

I particularly enjoy the fact that he continuously discusses his color choices.  I have been in live workshops where the instructor did not do this, even when prompted over and over again.  It's invaluable to hear his choices as he paints.",1470873600,3,383,4.573529411764706
8282354,5,B001B97VCO,I took a workshop from Alvaro.  This is a great video to buy after his workshop to reinforce what you have learned.  He is a master watercolor artist and doesn't hold back in explaining his techniques.,1444867200,,201,4.555555555555555
8282355,5,B001B97VCO,"I have learned so much with this DVD it was a wise choice for me, I have watched it several times always learning  something new. My water color painting has improved,  I am more relaxed when I paint.
I highly recommend this DVD.

8282356,5,B001B97VCO,"Have viewed this video many times and there is always something new to discover and learn.  This video is a good investment for the watercolorist wanting to learn to paint better urban scenes.  If you can't attend one of his workshops, this video is a good choice.",1418083200,7,264,4.595744680851064
8282357,5,B001B97VCO,"Great for experienced watercolorists who needs to loosen up, stop noodling, and eliminate the unnecessary. While Alvaro does talk about his palette and some techniques, the value of this DVD is watching an inspiring, instinctive painter at work.",1409011200,2,245,5.473684210526316
8282358,5,B001B97VCO,"Many instructional DVDs will show you only one demo. This one contains 5!!! Great variety of subject matter, too. I  think it's geared more towards people who already have experience with water color which helps you understand his process and choices. It's an excellent video. Alvaro is a water color rock star.",1405814400,3,311,4.980769230769231
8282359,5,B001B97VCO,Alvaro gives you five good paintings.  I've watched it 4 times and it's 2hrs.  If you listen to what he says you really get into his head and how he paints.  Very worthwhile,1379548800,8,173,4.181818181818182
8282360,5,B001B97VCO,"Alvaro is truly inspiring and a delight to watch this talented artist.  As all masters, he demonstrates breath taking art with ease and fluidity.  You'll watch it again and again.",1367193600,3,179,4.933333333333334
8282361,4,B001B97VCO,It's an excellent video showing Alvaro's dynamic technic in watercolor but when he spoke of spitting on the painting he lost me,1363564800,,127,4.818181818181818
