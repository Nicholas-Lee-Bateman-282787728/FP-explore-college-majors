8295165,4,B001DWNUB0,"DVD Review: Referring to Image Ent. product. Excellent transfer quality, audio is neat and so forth.

Movie Review: Typical Japanese vs. Chinese martial arts movie filled with action, bloody violence and stuff. Nothing too innovative but it's a fun happy movie overall.

Conclusion: 5 stars for the DVD and 3 1/2 stars for the movie.",1413763200,2,333,5.036363636363636
8295166,4,B001DWNUB0,"Originally, ""The Thunderbolt Fist"" was the last release for Shaw Brothers at the end of 1972; several months earlier, the soon-to-be immortal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Boxer-aka-Five-Fingers-Of-Death/dp/B000MM0LE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Boxer (aka 'Five Fingers Of Death')</a>&nbsp;came out. ""KB"" is specifically mentioned because after having watched ""TTF"", I noticed many similarities between the two films.

If you've seen ""KB"" and ""TTF"" (or the Celestial trailer for ""TTF"", at least), then you know more than a few actors from ""KB"" are in this picture, too. Further research I did on this shows both movies have South Koreans for directors; Jeong Chang-hwa directed ""KB"", while Cheung Yat Woo (a.k.a. Chang I Hu) handled ""TTF""...or DID he? If you watch these two movies back to back, you will notice many instances where the look, the pacing, the editing of ""TTF"" (both films share a common film editor, among a few other technical people) echoes the directorial style Chang-hwa brought to ""KB"". It leads me to speculate that Chang-hwa may have assisted Woo in some way, including directing some scenes uncredited!

Considering the language barrier Chang-hwa went through in making ""KB"", it's possible he was helping out a fellow countryman for the same reason. Beyond the fact these were both Shaw productions, I say it's NO coincidence that distinctive FEEL of ""KB"" is felt in more than a few parts of ""TTF""! (If you've seen enough Shaw movies, you can't mistake ""KB"" for a Chang Cheh, Ho Meng-hua OR Sun Chung film, that's for definite.) Considering that the finished film is as solid as most Shaw productions are (given the budget), I felt I was watching anything BUT a ""rip-off"", so whether Chang-hwa added to this or not, it's still an entertaining movie.

In ""TTF"", you'll find a script that is influenced by ""KB"", ""One-Armed Swordsman"" and ""Fist of Fury"" (or any film where it's the Chinese versus the occcupying Japanese); how it's played out in its 91 minutes makes it stand out among lesser, hastily-produced ""quickies"".

Some find fault in the casting of Chuan Yuan (previously seen in Chang Cheh's ""Vengeance!"") as the male lead; looking at him on the cover of the DVD's case, he does resemble a cross between Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Bob Denver! Once you see Yuan in action, however, you'll notice he manages his fighting and acting equally well.

The young and lovely Shih Szu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shadow-Boxer/dp/B002C39T5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shadow Boxer</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deadly-Breaking-Sword/dp/B000JJSKW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deadly Breaking Sword</a>, and appeared with Yuan in ""The Lady Hermit"") gets top billing here because she was more established than Yuan; she keeps ""TTF"" afloat by having a convincing chemistry with her rugged-looking (in a ""Chen Kuan Tai"" way) co-star. Her fight scenes are very enjoyable by the energy she puts into Leung Siu Chung's fight choreography (though a rare bad camera angle, here and there, briefly ruins the illusion); she steals the picture every moment she's on (and has an amusing sequence where she makes like ""Robin Hood"") because she is absolutely NO ""damsel in distress""!

James Nam (he lost his eyeballs in ""KB"") plays the main Japanese adversary nasty enough that when his moment of reckoning arrives, he is so DESERVING of what he gets dealt to him (NO SPOILERS)!

Wong Chin Feng, Fang Mien, Tung Lam and Gam Kei Chu are among the many others in the cast; also, look for a couple of brief bits with Unicorn Chan, and watch for early, ""pre-fame"" appearances by Sammo Hung and [Alexander] Fu Sheng! (You'll find him within the 14-15 minute mark of the movie; I'll have to go back and see where Sammo is!)

For this Image DVD release to have ""TTF"" noted as ""a martial arts classic"" on the packaging, and yet contains NO credits for the [main] cast and crew, is being sort of contradictory, to say the least! Moreover, the front of the case shows Nam in a larger portrait than Yuan, and as Yuan appears in that shot, he looks anything BUT heroic! (It's the same pictorial layout on the original Hong Kong Celestial DVD issue, so it's not Image's fault, as is.) The widescreen picture is dazzling (by Image standards); as usual, I got more from the Mandarin dub (with subtitles) than the English dub, but anyone who loves their favorite Chinese actors speaking proper English will enjoy the latter.

Please don't let a LOUSY DVD sleeve prevent YOU from getting a fine action picture where the off-beat casting actually adds some SPICE to what could've been [potentially] routinely bland if other hands put different actors in the main roles! Those who have ""KB"" will want to check this out, too; regardless of WHOSE hands worked on this, they'll find much to appreciate about this veritable companion piece to the Lo Lieh classic! Not earth-shattering, but still recommended for all ""old school"" fans, and not to be missed by the followers of Shih Szu!

All the best, Brother Fang.",1268956800,5,5167,5.30562347188264
8295167,5,B001DWNUB0,"""Thunderbolt Fist"" is a very standard revenge-driven heroic martial arts movie with tragedy, cool training to achieve a ""special maneuver"", i.e. the THUNDERBOLT FIST (neat how they got that right there in the title, eh?). I don't use the word ""standard"" to knock the film in any way, though. Sure, it's a formula, but when it's done well I find it an entertaining one, and ""Thunderbolt Fist"" is a well done Shaw Brothers classic from 1972.
The DVD quality is excellent as have been all of Image Entertainment's Shaw Bros. releases. The audio is great (Original Mandarin or English-dubbed soundtracks) with English and Spanish subtitles, the video quality is great, and I look forward to more Shaw Bros. releases from Image (and Dragon Dynasty, Well Go USA, Jade Tiger, and Tokyo Shock as well)!",1241136000,,794,4.932835820895522
