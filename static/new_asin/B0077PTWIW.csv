8512092,4,B0077PTWIW,"Tom Palazollo's footage of the 1979 East Chicago Labor Day Festival, transports the viewer back to a time that might seem all-too-familiar or eerily fascinating depending on one's age. For those who lived through the late Seventies in Chicago, the bellbottom jeans and disco music are memories of a forgotten age, but to the initiated, like me, who grew up in a more contemporary version of the Windy City, the images are startling.
 I was most struck by the teenage beauty contest over who would lay crown to the supposedly-hallowed crown of Miss East Chicago. The answers that the contestants gave to questions were so foreign to my generation that I couldn't help but chuckle at their nave and humble sensibilities. When one participant is asked what her preferred occupation would be, she answers ""beautician."" I can't imagine a girl today would ever aspire to be a beautician, even if it was so popular just over 30 years ago. That is why this footage is so interesting and vital, because it shines a light on the glaring differences between the past and the present. But also, through the documentary, one gains an understanding of how innately similar we are now to those who celebrated Labor Day on that beautiful afternoon in 1979, even if a few of them wanted to be beauticians",1337040000,,1287,4.797297297297297
