7799332,5,1580193382,"Guided by the loving Holy Spirit, Pastor Bachelor presents a great, deep study on Walking through Revelations. This is an awesome dvd set. I just love to sit in front of the tv at my little kitchen table and take my bible and follow along. You will feel the experience of God's love through Jesus Christ and HIS Loving future plans for you and I to be in HIS Kindgom. This dvd is truly a blessing from the Lord, and I am glad I made the purchase. :)))))))",1321315200,,455,4.181818181818182
