He gets creative with some of the movements which is a nice change. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of the traditional exercises.",1355443200,2,310,4.271186440677966
8326363,5,B001D8LC6O,"This is as basic a DVD as you can get.  What it is missing? 1) Equipment needs identified.  In one workout, besides a Kettle bell, you need a pull-up bar and a strap to hold both you and your Kettle-bell.  2) On another DVD, you need two Kettle-bells of the same weight.  3) The first workout has the introduction to the DVD which should have been separate.

There is no music, no sexy girls, just this 54 year old stud who can work out hard and talk clearly during the workout.  He is the real deal and very legit.

This has four very good workouts that will enhance your stable of Kettle-bell/weight training even cardio workouts.

Is this the end all, be all for kettle-bell workouts?  No.

Am I glad I purchased this?  You bet!  Five Stars even without the sexy backups!",1343520000,4,774,4.373239436619718
8326364,5,B001D8LC6O,"I own 5 KB DVDs and this is my favorite by far. 4 great workouts. You should know that ""the crusher"" requires a pull-up bar and ""walk the bear"" requires two bells. Well worth the price! Steve Maxwell also has a lot of stuff on youtube if you like his workouts but you won't find anything like this.",1314057600,4,298,4.155172413793103
8326365,1,B001D8LC6O,"Though the exercises are indeed cruel, I was expecting more of a dynamic yet forceful workout, but it is too SLOW to be able to use it.",1313712000,3,135,4.037037037037037
8326366,5,B001D8LC6O,"Though new to kettlebells, I'd like to think that I am in pretty good shape.  Either way, these workouts were brutal yet fun due to the variety of exercises he includes and the interactive/instructional manner in which he does the video.  I already have a few more of his DVDs on order.",1306022400,5,286,4.480769230769231
8326367,5,B001D8LC6O,"This DVD is a great follow-on to Maxwell's 300 Kettlebell Challenge for those mid/advanced folks looking for more KB variety. The user is assumed to know basic kettlebell moves, such as swings, snatches, high pulls, TGUs, etc. This makes the instruction on disk 1 of 300 extremely helpful as a prerequisite. The new moves are mostly instructed-on-the-fly, so the first time or two may require an occasional pause/rewind to check that you are doing the exercise correctly.

The four workouts are:
1. Get Up & Go
2. The Crusher
3. Walking The Bear
4. Heaven & Hell

Workout #1 is intended to focus on the shoulders, yet is also a nice all-around workout, about 30min long. The first 10 min are a great warmup/stretch set of KB exercises, useful to begin any KB workout. Multiple variants (such as the gladiator) of the TGUs intermixed with variants of rows play the major role in the workout. Very good for stretching the chest too. As if that wasn't enough, it ends with heart-pumping interval swings.

Workout #2 focuses on pecs/arms/grip, but also includes lower-body exercises, including the pistol. Only the very first exercise is done as a kind of pullup using a KB hanging by a strap from a pullup bar. Too much for me, but that's ok, because he then gets rid of the chinup bar and uses the crush press instead for those of us mere mortals.  There is a pause point later on for a 3 minute rest between the upper body section and the lower body section of the workout. About 25 min.

Workout #3 requires two same-size KBs for Walking the Bear. Due to fitness level and a bad shoulder, this one is beyond me. Its only about 7 min long but its brutal.

Workout #4 is only about 16 min and is great when you want a brief intense all-around workout. The first part (the ""omelet"") is continuous multiple sets of 5-rep swings/high-pulls/snatch/clean-press/circular cleans/reverse lunges combos. The last 6 min is the Heaven & Hell, which are sets of swing/halo/no-momentum deck squat combos that really push the limit. You'll be lucky to last the 16 minutes.

For me, #1 and 4 are the workouts I go to. I also found his use and explanation of ""supersets"" of exercises helpful for when I want to combine some exercises into a unique routine.",1304208000,24,2238,4.650632911392405
8326368,5,B001D8LC6O,"I love kettlebell workouts, and this DVD set is awesome.  I copied it to my Itunes, and saved the workouts to my Itouch so I can use it at the gym.",1297641600,2,147,3.7419354838709675
8326369,4,B001D8LC6O,"This is a great workout video for kettlebells. THIS IS NOT AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO....I REPEAT THIS IS NOT AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO! it is also not for the faint of heart. No instruction on this video just great workouts that correlate to what your doing. No fluff here! Make sure you are proficient in the basic kettlebell exercises like; the swing, snatch, clean and press, and get ups before you buy this video. You may have to improvise on some of the exercises if you cannot do them. For example I cannot do a pistol squat, so I used my jungle gym to assist me and did not use the kettlebell. When I got better I did the pistols with the k/b like the workout intended. Steve Maxwell puts all the basic exercises into four workout plans that really tax your ability and strength endurance. If you can do the described kettlebell exercises then this video is for you. If you cannot do the basic kettlebell exercises, buy a basic kettlebell video first, master the exercises, then buy this video. In all, a little expensive, not intended for learning how to use a k/b, but worth the workout plans and motvation in keeping up with the ageless athlete himself Steve Maxwell.",1278115200,7,1171,4.580952380952381
8326370,5,B001D8LC6O,Excellent video. Good variety of exercises. For some exercises you will need more than on K-bell.,1231200000,8,97,5.125
