8366525,2,B002DZG86U,"I have ordered a couple of DVDs of Piano Guy.  BUT -- it may just be me.  I'm just learning chords.  I thought this would help, and that I would be playing ""Amazing Grace"" or something, and simple chords.  The advertisements to me make it sound like you'll be playing like a pro with practice.  Years ago, I played the piano for about 7 years, but I did not learn to play with the left hand using chords.  I do like trying to learn with chords, but I find ""Piano Guy"" too difficult to follow.  And to me he seems to talk the whole time.  When you are trying to learn something, and someone says, you can play the chord this way (so I watch and think, great, I've got it), then he's talking, and then says are you can play it this way, or even this way.  I could not keep up.  Just too confusing for me.  He's probably a very good teacher, but I want to learn the basic chords and play a couple of simple religious songs, but you can't learn when someone is talking the whole time and changing things around.  Would I recommend this?  No.  But that's me.  If you know chords and how to use, then yes, you would probably do good with this DVD.  But I do not plan to order any more of the DVDs.",1326326400,3,1191,4.047210300429184
