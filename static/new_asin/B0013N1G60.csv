8252254,1,B0013N1G60,"The whole tape was an advertisement for selling Dr Earth products, about 15 minutes worth.
It was talk, talk, talk about the benefits of his product over others and no gardening ideas were shown.
Nothing of gardening value at all.
I paid to see an ad.  How tremendously disappointing.
The blurb should have stated that it was all advertising.",1239580800,7,342,4.796610169491525
