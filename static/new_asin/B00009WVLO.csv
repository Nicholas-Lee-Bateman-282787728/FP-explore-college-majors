1894629,5,B00009WVLO,"James Woods actually looks pretty much like Guiliani and he acts beautifully as always but I must admit this movie could have been heaps better. Anyways, watching it means going back through september eleven again and it hurts just as when it first happened. It made me cry. Also there's things we never knew about Guiliani's life. According to the movie he made New York better than it was so...well done Rudy.",1067904000,2,411,4.722222222222222
1894630,4,B00009WVLO,"This film based on a book called 'Rudy' is sopposed to tell the inside story of 'Americas Mayor'.  It does a commendable job.  It looks at Rudy's early courtship of Donna Hannover.  It looks at Rudy's role in breaking the mafia and wall street, which gained him fame.  It looks at Rudies first dismall election campaign and the pogroms and upheavels of the Dinkins stagnation.  It looks at Rudy's many quirks and his affairs with Christine Latigano and his subsequent affair that ended his marriage.  The meeting with Ray Harding of the Liberal party is portrayed well as is the infighting on his campaign and his relentless crusade to cut useless jobs at city hall.
It looks at his conflict with Bracken and the Amadou Dialo killing.
Yet the movies failure is in its odd portrayel of Sept 11th.  Although the scenes are shocking the moves cinematography of the Sept 11th incident feels to much like a soap opera, rather then the 'real life' portrayel the directors were going for.  I think the scenes could have been better.  Nevertheless I loved the use of real footage from Sept 11th, soemthing we dotn see anough of.
I was dismayed not to see more of Rudys crusade against the Bums, against the honking and throwing Arafat out of the U.N as well as his attack on the diplomatic parking problems in N.Y.
Guliani was the biggest of the big mayors, like a modern day Laguardia.  THis is a great film but it does lack somethings and does miss the boat in some scenes.  The latigano affair was emphasized at the expense of losing coverage of some of the  great quirks and crusades of the Guliani era which cleaned up the city.",1067558400,3,1625,4.58477508650519
1894631,5,B00009WVLO,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be about football.  It's not.  It's about Rudy.  Rudy is also in The Lord of the Rings.  It's awesome when he gets carried by the tree people.  When I saw it in the theater I shouted ""AWESOME!"" and then someone hit me in the head with a Raisonette.",1064880000,5,284,4.090909090909091

7993767,5,B00009WVLO,"I saw this as a TV-Movie.
It is a good movie about Rudy Giuliani, who faced political and personal problems in his Life and career. But on Sept. 11th as Mayor of New York City He Led the people and City thru the worst tragedy  with his Leadership and compassion.
It tells how he led the people and city of New York to healing and recovery.
James Woods is excellent as Rudy GiuLiani.",1474156800,,382,4.232876712328767

7993769,4,B00009WVLO,"Wow- James Woods is amazing portraying the mayor.  The use of real footage of the September 11 attacks is just as brutal and difficult to go through as it was living through when it happened.  The movie gets the extra star for that.

However I have to agree with other reviewers that this film spends more time on the mayor's personal life than on many of his ""wars"" against crime in the city  (the removal of the squeegee guys, the panhandlers, the parking problems). (Though not necessary as part of the film I particularly remember the ad campaigns on the subways with the thought bubbles regarding panhandling).The film caught some of this during his war on the mafia and wall street but seemed to get lost later with more time spent on his affairs.  I don't particularly remember caring, even at that time, about whether he was having an affair but I definitely recall suddenly being able to walk around Times Square, particularly at night after a show, and not feel threatened by my surroundings.

Like others, I also feel the film misses somewhat on the rest of the 9/11 events, beyond the news footage from the day.  The press conferences, the way the mayor made you feel that he was there, guiding the city, carrying us through those days of turmoil, loss and confusion seems to be lost to the directorial choices made in the film.  Its a bit disappointing.

The special  features bonus documentary on the Day the Towers fell is a wonderful addition to the video.  It interviews and follows the stories and photos of various amateur and professional photographers who were at the World Trade Center that day.  An excellent addition and worth watching.",1428364800,,1660,4.725694444444445

7993771,3,B00009WVLO,"I recall meeting Rudy Giuliani at a book signing. The bookstore employees warned us several times that Giuliani will be unable to speak with us or personalize the signatures because the turnout was much greater than expected. When we got there, he very pleasantly asked us how we were, what our names were, gave us a personalized signature and wished us a good day. He struck me as someone who, generally, would be a decent person to work with. I realize he is a politician and politicians know its wise to be pleasant in public, but this side of Giuliani was missing from this documentary. The Giuliani of this documentary is an egomaniac who's abrasive 100% of the time. This documentary definitely gives you the feeling that you have to be obnoxious to get ahead.
The flashbacks between September 11 and the chronological depiction of his life were done unskillfully, at best.
Among the ""special features"" is a documentary on September 11 from the perspective of the photographers that was created with much more skill.
I can imagine some reasons to buy this DVD, certainly for a school library or as audiovisual material for a current events class. May be worth watching once. However, I doubt anyone would watch this more than once.",1078099200,3,1237,4.812206572769953
7993772,3,B00009WVLO,"I have always liked James Woods and I always will.  I did not much care for this film despite Woods' fine portrayal of Giuliani.  The film is watchable, and more than watchable, that I'll grant.  But it focuses obsessively on Giiuliani's marital problems and foibles, and only touches briefly on the truly wonderful things he did for New York.  Golly, you don't suppose the producers were Democrats, do you?  I mean, you could almost feel the pain of the producers of this film each time they were forced to discuss something intelligent that Giuliani did as mayor, and then of course the film would snap back to its main theme--that Giuliani was possibly a less-than-ideal husband or has other faults as a person, i.e. ego, ambition, vanity.  What great man or woman lacks these traits, anyway? Nothing wrong with including this as part of the film, but I felt that the story lacked balance and shows an underlying hostility to what Giuliani set out to and did accomplish as mayor of New York.
I was disappointed in the film and the only good thing about it is James Woods.  He makes the film watchable, but this movie falls far short of its potential.  Then again, one cannot realistically expect Hollywood to make a movie about conservative politics rescuing New York City from turning into an ungovernable mess.",1073001600,5,1315,4.762114537444934
7993773,3,B00009WVLO,This is a fascinating portrait of a complex political figure.  James Woods gives an incredible performance.  That said the film suffers greatly from an abrupt and weak ending.  I also didn't understand some the of characters...The people in his life.  Some of their motives and their backgrounds just weren't clear enough.  Worth seeing for the effective 9/11 sequences and for Woods'performance in the title role.,1070064000,3,414,5.3076923076923075
