5215727,3,B0090SVDRW,This film has a great storyline and wonderful cinematography but it is just missing something. The film is still worth a view.,1344470400,3,126,4.7727272727272725
5215728,5,B0090SVDRW,"This is so much more than simply a ""samurai"" movie with flashing swords and action.  The characters are well developed.  The story moves well and has strong emotional content.  For the discourse on honor and what honor truly is (i.e., being human and seeing all others as human, living with dignity and compassion), this movie is worth the cost to either rent on Amazon Video (which this one just did) or to buy when it is released (which this one intends to do).

The cinematography is spectacular and often breath taking, with a depth of atmosphere seldom seen in modern films.

The only complaint this one would have is with the closed caption translations of Japanese (as an example, ""I don't understand"" was often translated as ""I am sorry"" and in the context of the dialogue, such was not correct.  There are other examples however, for those who do not speak Japanese, the presented dialogue generally conveyed the story adequately).

This one is sorry that he can not give this film more than five stars.  It is a truly wonderful film far surpassing what one might expect from a film in this genre.  Miike-san did a subperb job.",1344038400,3,1136,4.696969696969697
5215729,5,B0090SVDRW,"Takashi Miike has done it again! Or has he? We know Miike for his taste in gory and disturbing films. Which is exactly why we love him for it. He crosses the boundaries, and tests his limits. In this film he spoke to us a bit differently, we didn't see too much action and blood in this beautiful movie, but what we did see is vengeance and love. a 10/10 in my book, were seeing a different side of Takashi again and we (the fans) hope he makes more like this classic piece.

5215959,5,B0090SVDRW,"Just saw this amazing film yesterday.  This film has little to no action despite what the trailer may have you think.  It's all story and is told very slowly but that does not mean that it is a boring film.  I could say that this is one of the best films I have seen.  The subtleties and events that happen in Hara-kiri packs more punches than most action films riddled with explosions and mayhem.  You will be in shock, horrified, sad, angry, and thrilled.  I'm a dude.  I don't cringe at the sight of blood often, but that scene early in the movie (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it) made my toes curl and I even had to turn away for a few seconds.  Such great acting and cinematography.  This is a very pretty film to look at.  I immediately watched the original version the next day, and I must say that both films are on par in terms of story.",1415750400,,865,4.1878787878787875
5215980,5,B0090SVDRW,"I find it rather interesting that the only two or three negative reviews found a handful of people who thought it helpful in spite of the overwhelming tide of positive ratings. I figured I'd put in my two cents. I saw the 1962 original before I even knew a remake had been made. It was, (and still is), a powerful, heart wrenching tragedy. It was/ is also a scathing critique of a culture that was built around a purely military mentality. No other culture, that I know of, created a complete society that was built around bravery, honor, and yes, death. The Japanese are the world's greatest perfectionists. As my sensei, who is Japanese, says. ""We not good at inventing things. We are good at perfecting what has been done.""

When I was first given this movie, I thought for a moment I'd been given a copy of the 1962 classic. We eagerly sat to watch it that evening. Initially, during the opening sequence, I thought they'd colorized. Once I saw the first actors enter into the scene I realized it had been remade. I sat back, a little skeptical, but open to it. Much to our delight, this remake is as wonderful as the original. The acting is superb! Is it better than the original? Of course not! Is it worse? Not at all. This remake is every bit as good as the original. They don't make movies like they did in 1962 anymore. And this update remains faithful to the original while adding more realism.

The samurai family in the remake are much poorer, grittier. You feel their poverty down to the bones. The scene where the father is trying to paste paper into the door to prevent the draft is moving and much warmer than the original is. You can feel little Kingo and Mihu's sickness. That's just for starters. The remake tears at the very fabric of a military culture gone awry just as much as the original. The fight between father and the three sadistic administrators is just as exciting and furious as in the original. But it's done in a bit much more realistic manner. Takei abandons the one-on-one scenario and makes it an attack on a group of friends/ colleagues on an outing. The final scene is as powerful and valient as the original. If you like Japanese cinema, and you like samurai movies, then get this film. There's no way you can't enjoy it.",1413417600,,2263,4.490291262135922
5215981,4,B0090SVDRW,"Amazing movie! The production design was spectacular. This was a triumph for Miike. This is quite simply a beautiful film, with good sword fights. The only complaint that I have is that it needed about two more large scale sword fights, and the middle third of the movie drags a bit and is too agonizing and mopey. Those things dragged this down to four stars, from what could have easily been a 5 star movie. I guess Miike didn't want to be unfaithful to the original. See this movie, though! It is rather brilliant, and actually far better than ""13 Assassins."" The movie plays like an elegant, visual haiku.",1412035200,,609,4.5963302752293576

5215985,5,B0090SVDRW,"An absolutely beautiful and haunting film from director Takashi Miike, who also directed '13 Assassins'; taken together, both movies stand as perhaps the best examples of samurai-cinema since director Akira Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune filmed 'Yojimbo', 'Sanjuro', and 'Throne of Blood'... or since director Masaki Kobayashi and actor Tatsuya Nakadai filmed the original 'Hara Kiri' in 1964. Kobayashi's masterpiece was a dark and tragic contrast to most of Kurosawa's films, and star Tatsuya Nakadai -- who was also in the Kurosawa classic 'Ran' -- gives his contemporary counterpart Ebiz Ichikawa a very difficult performance to match, transcend, or reinterpret. Ichizawa looks inward instead, with a brilliant and passionate portrayal rooted in the universal language of suffering.

The story takes place in 17th century Japan, a few decades after the bloodshed at the battle of Sekigahara in 1600 effectively consolidated political power. After some internal conflict, the Tokugawa clan assumes control, establishing a Shogunate that will rule for over 200 years, ending after the last samurai's of the last Shogun are defeated by the modern, rifle-bearing soldiers of the Emperor in 1867. The end of the Sengoku, or 'warring states', period of Japanese history meant peace for the people (it also often meant crippling poverty and famine, working themselves to death to pay the unreasonable, uncompromising taxes imposed by Edo), but it represented a long, slow decline for the hereditary Samurai class, many of them finding themselves without work, without money, without a Daimyo, and without a reason for living. Living by the Bushido code meant dying by the Bushido code, and the code demanded that a warrior who had failed his lord commit suicide by Hara-Kiri (or Seppuku). In front of noble spectators, the Samurai would use the shorter of his two swords, usually a tanto or wakizashi, to slice open his abdomen in a left-to-right motion, and sometimes extract his own intestines. At that point, his Kaishukunin (his appointed second, usually a warrior the samurai respects for his skills) would perform the merciful coup de grace, traditionally using a katana or dotanuki to deliver the 'kaishaku' decapitating stroke, a precise maneuver very different from cruder European decapitation. The result of the proper kaishaku stroke is the 'held head' -- dakikubi -- a thin layer of flesh keeps the severed head from rolling away, dropping forward against the chest instead.

Not a pleasant subject. Hara-Kiri reflected the level of devotion and mental fortitude that was required of the samurai, and remains a powerful image for modern viewers and readers trying to understand what drove the Samurai class. Takashi Miike has been a director of note for many years now, and films like 'Ichi the Killer', 'Fudoh: The New Generation', 'Crows Zero', 'Full Metal Yakuza' and 'Gozu' helped him earn a very large cult following. He has made many different kinds of films, but his affinity for shocking brutality and graphic, gruesome scenes ot torture, mutilation, and sexual violence has defined him as a controversial and cutting edge film-maker. His fascination with violence has helped to make '13 Assassins' and 'Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai' the visceral, sometimes difficult to watch, masterpieces that they are. They are by no means gratuitous, in my opinion, but they take the viewer into the darkest corners of early-Edo-period Japan, a time and place where human life was cheap to those in power, and poverty drove decent people to commit desperate acts.

The story begins with a master-less samurai, whose Daimyo has been disbanded by the Shogun, requesting of the head retainer of a neighboring Lord that he might use their courtyard to commit hara-kiri. Trying to dissuade the ronin, the older samurai tells him the story of the last man who came to the castle attempting a 'suicide bluff'. Thinking the Lord or his Retainer would be moved by the sight of such a noble warrior driven to such extremes through no fault of his own, and offer him employment or money rather than having his courtyard stained by such an unlucky act, as some had actually done, the skinny young samurai had his bluff called. They allowed him to bathe and eat, then gave him traditional funerary garb, and summoned him to the courtyard where they awaited his honorable death. The young man was obviously not expecting this... and what follows is one of the saddest, most excruciating, and haunting 20 minutes of film I've ever seen.

What happened to the young samurai, what happens with the older samurai who came from the same disgraced Daimyo's service, but claims not to know this unfortunate younger man, would be unfair of me to reveal. Suffice to say that it is impossible not to be moved by this film. Even if you know little of Japanese history, the story itself is clear enough. The samurai were not so different from The Knights Templar, or even Secret Service agents who have sworn to take a bullet and die for the president. Christian martyrs were willing to die horrible deaths for their beliefs, just like Buddhist monks. The story here is a universal one, and I will say that at the heart of this movie, lies the conflict between loyalty to a code, and loyalty to ones' wife and child. Or perhaps it asks the question: how can we allow ourselves to be defined by any code that asks us to turn our back on humanity -- our own humanity and the suffering of humanity?

A brilliant film, but very dark, and not recommended for anyone sensitive to blood and suffering; '13 Assassins' asks the same questions, is just as brilliant, and again has very dark and shocking moments that serve to burn the film into the viewers brain like 'Irreversible' by Gaspar Noe. It is lighter in tone, however. 'Hara-Kiri: Death of A Samurai': 92/100; '13 Assassins': 93/100",1410652800,3,5867,5.025693730729702

5216076,5,B0090SVDRW,"Being a fan of Japanese cinema in general and Kobayashi's original film in particular, I was a bit skeptical of this remake, and might not have bothered had it come from any other filmmaker.  But Takashi Miike is a true cinema rebel, and the one constant in his sprawling body of work is his capacity to surprise.  Here I thought he might find opportunities for spectacular violence and at least one outrageous action sequence, but was concerned to see if his usual over-the-top, anything-goes style would spoil such a classically elegant story of political rebellion examined through the lens of personal tragedy.

Once again, Miike the trickster caught me off-guard.  While Kobayashi's film is an ice-cold, austere indictment of what happens when a moral code of behavior becomes an anachronism, Miike's is surprisingly warm - which, naturally, makes the impending tragedy all the more heart-wrenching.  I've watched the original film's opening disembowelment scene at least half a dozen times, and while it's always cringe-inducing, it never moved me the way that Miike's treatment of the scene did.  In spite of my expectations, Miike kept it simple and focused, rather than painting the set in blood.  His restraint pays off in spades, and even though I knew exactly where the story was going, I found myself pulled in immediately.  Kobayashi's film is awe-inspiring, but never moved me to tears; Miike's, while less grand and stately, had me wiping my eyes before the final reel of explosive violence.

Overall, I was very impressed with Miike's restraint and compassion.  It's hard to compare this film to the original version, simply because no modern actor would be able to match Tatsuya Nakadai.  Ebizo Ichikawa doesn't even try to match Nakadai's soul-crushing intensity, which is probably for the best.  His approach to the role is much more gentle and human.  Miike as a filmmaker continues evolve in unpredictable directions, and while this film is not one of his masterpieces, it's certainly no embarrassment.  Diehard fans of the original film may find this a pale shadow of Kobayashi's film, while drooling Miike fans may find it boring, but these are the extreme ends of fan reaction.  More discerning viewers who can set aside their preconceptions should find plenty to admire in this new version.",1384300800,12,2316,5.08994708994709

 I felt that this was a remarkable film and a true masterpiece for Takashi Miike! What a wonderful direction he went with this film!!!! For those of you that like his horror, please keep an open mind. This man to me made me feel like I was transported back in time.

I love the fantasy style samurai movies, the over the top bloody movies, and the very strong Drama movies like twilight samurai.

This Film is a DRAMA and has no Action, no fights, nothing like that.
My big problem with it is that it start's out very interesting, very strong, the Plot is Strong until the End

The entire movie keeps you waiting for the final showdown, for a battle for Revenge, and it's advertised as such.
BUT, it ends with no blood shed, it ends meaningless, it just ends in a very Lame way, nothing Epic, no taking revenge, nothing going on interesting on Screen, they talk and talk and talk and in the end when you wait for the big fight the hero takes a wooden sword and just hits people a bit and that's it
And that's why I give it 2 stars, it's not good enough,

So if you think this is a cool samurai movie, it's not,
if you think it's a sword action film, it's not.

it's a drama with a stupid ending.",1379980800,,985,4.168421052631579

5216134,3,B0090SVDRW,"To remake a towering 50 year old classic film is gutsy and will obviously bring about criticisms and comparisons. Miike's effort, taken on it's
own, is a fine film, with beautiful photography and a well rounded cast, but compared to the original, it comes up short. Two key scenes illustrate this perfectly:
First, the Motome suicide scene. In both films, the scene is very graphic, a bit more so in the Miike version. But Miike, the clan counselor, Saito, can't bear any more and delivers the final blow out of desperate mercy. Kobayashi isn't so lenient and has Omodaka finish Motome off out of outrage because of Motome's act of ""insolence"".
Second, in the final scene, Hanshiro uses a bamboo sword....somewhat cunning and ironic, but that about sums up the main problem with the film....we are bludgeoned and pained by Miike's bamboo sword, unlike Kobayashi, who uses cold steel, never easing up, delivering the final blow square and unflinchingly to the solar plexus in the last minute of his film that leaves up, literally, quite breathless.
Yes, Miike's is a solid, poignant film, much like Kobayashi's. Both are broadly paced, meticulous and border on tedium at times, but Miike's is smaller scaled, more of a personal family tragedy, and lacks the ingredients that Kobayashi had: namely, Nakadai, Rentaro Mikuni and Toru Takemitsu, with his biwa scored edgy soundtrack. Kobayashi, on the other hand, uses cold steel relentlessly in his grand epic indictment of a large rigid government that exists only for it's own sake.",1378080000,4,1530,5.02755905511811

Sometimes hard times come - recessions, etc. and the ""feudal lord"" (employer) lets employees go.  Most have mortgages, utilities, food expenses, and car payments to pay.  Culture says you should be able to support your family.  Some feel shame, failure, discouragement and despair when they cannot find another ""feudal lord"" (employee).  Some use up their savings; some have no savings.  Some have no one to turn to; some are ashamed to ask for help; some are turned away when they ask for help.  Some jump out of buildings, some commit suicide; but, most keep going until they can find another way.

5216154,4,B0090SVDRW,"Takashi Miichi's remake of the iconic 1962 ""Hara Kiri,"" directed by Masaki Kobayashi, in color and 3-D for theater-goers, would surely be acclaimed as a near masterwork, a return to the cinematic artistry that made Kobayashi and Kurosawa sublime in their time. Unfortunately for Miichi, too many of us remember the original in all its black-and-white starkness and moodiness. Remaking Hara Kiri is as presumptuous as rewriting Hamlet or recomposing The Marriage of Figaro. The good news is that Miichi follows the script and the ineluctable timing of Kobayashi's classic almost scene for scene... until the climax, the furor that erupts in the last ten minutes. To compare the climactic scenes would constitute an atrocious spoilage, so I won't. But I will say that Miichi's finale discards the profound historical significance of Kobayashi's. Both films are quite worth seeing, believe me, even on successive evenings.

The most salient difference, nevertheless, needs to be expressed. The original starred Tatsuyo Nakadai, whose ferocity and intensity made him the Dark counterpart to the lustiness and mirth of Toshiro Mifune. Nobody could match Nakadai in this role; Ebizo Ichikawa earns my admiration for trying.",1370390400,6,1217,5.405263157894737

5216156,5,B0090SVDRW,"Hanshiro visits the house of a powerful lord to request a sacrificial suicide. Hanshiro is warned of the consequences he faces if he is bluffing through the story of Motome, the last samurai that requested a ""bluff suicide"". Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai is a superb tale of tragedy, vengeance, and honor.

I enjoyed the story in this film. It is a powerful film that subtly asks many questions. You don't have to watch this film for its compelling message; you can enjoy this film as the superb samurai drama it is. Some scenes will be hard to watch, both because of the violence and tragedy. It is not an action film, despite the superb final sequence/showdown, but it is often tense and violent; don't expect a film like ""13 Assassins"", and you shouldn't be disappointed. It is a fairly slow paced, but it always manages to move forward and keep the audience hooked. The film is beautifully shot, the cinematography is stunning, and the action is superbly choreographed. The film also features magnificent performances from the entire cast. I also loved the music in this film, all the way up to the credits.

Overall, Hara-Kiri is a brilliant and compelling samurai drama. As of 3/21/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, a purchase is highly recommended for fans of the genre, a rental for those weary about the slow pace.

5216321,4,B0090SVDRW,"When I heard that Miike Takeshi was doing a remake of Kobayashi Masaki's 1962&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harakiri/dp/B005D0RDCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harakiri</a>&nbsp;(Japanese title: ""Seppuku""), I had some trepidation to say the least. I love Miike. I love his over-the-top sensibilities, his ultra-violence Grand Guignols, not to mention his complete mind tweaks. But Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" is the opposite of everything Miike.

A slow, careful essay on the pointlessness of honor, Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" is up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B004D1CK32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>&nbsp;as one of the best samurai films ever made, one of the best Japanese films ever made--maybe one of the best films ever made, period. Kobayashi shows the hollowness of the word ""honor,"" and how elite classes and bureaucrats use ""honor"" and ""duty"" to manipulate and control, while showing none of those traits themselves. The film is a metaphor for Japan during WWII, or America during the Iraq war, or any time soldiers have died pointless, anonymous deaths for a cause their leaders assured them was ""honorable."" One top of that, the film is about 85% some guy kneeling and talking, and maybe 15% action at best.

And Miike Takeshi was going to remake that? In 3-D?

 I was shocked to see what a phenomenal film Miike created. He took Kobayashi's film and updated it in cinematography and visual splendor, while staying respectful to the original, true to its themes, and restrained in both tone and execution.

If you have never seen Kobayashi's film (And if you haven't, what is wrong with you? I can only assume that you hate great movies.), the story begins with the ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo appearing on the steps of the manor house of a rich and powerful lord. Like many of his class, Hanshiro has fallen into dismal poverty following the dissolution of his clan. He requests the use of the courtyard to commit honorable, ritual suicide and end his suffering like a warrior. From there, a complex story unfolds as the lord tells the story of another young samurai who recently made the same request, to which Hanshiro has his own story ready in reply. It is soon made aware that this is not a chance meeting, and that Hanshiro did not choose this particular lord's house blindly to make his final statement about life.

Miike's version, titled ""Hara-Kiri- The Death of a Samurai"" (Japanese title: ""Ichimei"" or ""A Life""), plays out an almost identical story. If fact, the only noticeable difference was that he pumped up the violence in the suicide scenes in somewhat typical Miike fashion. The effects are never too gory to distract, but he makes you feel the pain and appreciate the willpower necessary to slowly drive a bamboo stake into your own body. He added a few action scenes--some of the things that appear off-camera in Kobayashi's film are shown in-your-face in Miike's. And while Kobayashi's film is in black-and-white, contributing to its stark, bleak nature, Miike made full use of color and pageantry. This pushes the distance even further between the well-fed, wealthy lord and the desolate ronin Hanshiro.

The cast are all top-notch pros of the Japanese film industry. Kabuki actor Ichizawa Ebizo carries the film in the lead role of Hanshiro. Ichizawa does a fantastic job, with the only mark against him being his age. Really, he is too young. It isn't fair to compare him to Nakadai Tatsuya who originated the role--seeing as how Nakadai is one of Japan's greatest actors--but Ichizawa lacks some of the dead-eyed weariness necessary that comes with having lived and suffered too long. Even with that strike against him, however, Ichizawa masters the subtle complexities required of Hanshiro. Yakusho Koji (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babel/dp/B000P6PVLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babel</a>) plays the Lord Kageyu, and is perfectly suited for the role. Yakusho is a familiar face in Japanese film, a Miike regular, and a consummate professional. More of a surprise was Takenaka Naoto (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance/dp/B0002V7S34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance?</a>, in which Yakusho also appeared.), the ubiquitous clown that seems to appear in nine-tenths of Japanese films, bugging his eyes and cracking wise. Takenaka was all but indistinguishable in his costume playing Kageyu's advisor. He played the role straight with none of his usual antics.

The only real disappointment to Hara Kiri-Death of a Samurai was the ""in 3-D!!!"" tagline. This is just a gimmick, no more no less, and does not at all serve the story. This is not an action flick. This is not a large-scale picture. Remaking ""Harakiri"" in 3-D is like remaking 12 Angry Men in 3-D. It serves no purpose whatsoever. In his favor, Miike kept the 3-D subtle and unobtrusive, using it to add depth-of-field and little else. The film works 100% as well in regular 2-D, and possibly even better because you aren't encumbered by the glasses.

But I can see why he did it. The gimmick draws viewers, who would normally pass on the film. It worked to get my wife to go see it, who can't stand samurai films. But she was lured in by the 3-D, then won by the story.",1346371200,2,5386,5.4176610978520285
8533461,5,B0090SVDRW,"The cinematography alone is reason enough to watch this tale of Bushido in feudal Japan. I recently purchased Blade of the Immortal and this masterful samurai tale and am completely blown away.  This movie is powerful yet subtle as events begin to build to the action filled conclusion. I would compare this movie to the great western ""Unforgiven"".  The film centers on the family life of a samurai retainer who becomes a ronin following the whims of the Shogun.  If you are a fan of Takashi Miike do not hesitate and buy this work of art.",1520640000,,539,4.59375
8533462,5,B0090SVDRW,Between this movie in 13 Assassins I have completely been able to win over people that have never watch martial arts and Samurai films before. This is a long movie but worth every minute you put into it is fantastic the action scenes are great and the drama when it's there is on point. I think it's rare when a song or movie gets remade well but this is definitely a fantastic remake on the original. Highly recommended.,1518480000,2,421,4.410256410256411
8533463,5,B0090SVDRW,This is a really good movie and how they struggled and their unique way of sword fighting always fascinated me,1516924800,,110,4.55
8533464,5,B0090SVDRW,This was a surprisingly good movie. Has a slow pace to it but definitely pays off in the end. A little brutal in one scene but overall great movie,1516665600,,146,4.068965517241379
8533465,4,B0090SVDRW,"The 1962 film is my favorite film of all time, so I was very excepted to see the remake knowing it was just that.

This film is true to the original in plot, and is a good film and benefits from modern advances in cinematography and budget. Despite its obvious advantages, this film suffered from the zeitgeist of 21st century film. Beautiful special effects do not a great film make. This remake misses points on many of the subtle and fine points. Laconic phrases are replaced by conversations. The romance between Chijiwa and Miho is turned to 11. This film takes liberties with certain detail I wish were left alone. The original score replaced with a full orchestra.

Criticism not withstanding this is a good film. The plot is good, the lessons are valuable, and the cinematography is beautiful. I would recommend this film to my friends who do not enjoy classic samurai films as an introduction to the genre.

One odd point for anyone paying attention, there are many more cats in this version than the original.",1515283200,3,1019,4.713483146067416
8533466,5,B0090SVDRW,Movie will make you cry and cheer when revenge has been given. Guys if your woman (or if you are dating a twink) wants a tear jerker here is a movie you can watch with her (unless she can't read). You will be able to satisfy both your tastes for feelings and violence. A love story that ends in tragedy with a great ending even if it is a sad one.,1515024000,,347,3.9014084507042255
8533467,5,B0090SVDRW,"Why you should watch this remake of a classic.
It was as affecting as the kobayashi original. And a bit more grueling and sad.
Its in color. There are a few small additions to the story including a nice white cat, and the endings wild sprawl unfolds differently.",1514332800,,262,4.479166666666667
8533468,5,B0090SVDRW,Excellent remake.,1512691200,,17,8.0
8533469,3,B0090SVDRW,"Takashi Miike is of course one of Japan's acclaimed directors, but I have yet to find one of his works that I consider a great. Unfortunately, the original masterpiece ""Hara Kiri"" directed by Masaki Kobayashi is hard act to follow, and in this newer remake, Naoto Takenaka does a decent portrayal of a dark revenge obsessed master swordsman, but pales when compared to the original Tatsuya Nakadai's perfection.  Miike's version substituting a bamboo sword for steel in the final battle seemed unbelievable, sorry if thats a spoiler.",1510185600,,533,5.126436781609195
8533470,5,B0090SVDRW,Such a touching movie.  The back story leaves you in tears.,1508284800,,59,4.363636363636363
