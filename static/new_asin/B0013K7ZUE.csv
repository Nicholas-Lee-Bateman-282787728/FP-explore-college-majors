3113554,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I found this movie by accident, as an adult, and have watched it several times and given it as a gift twice. There's something irresistible about a kid searching for his parents (and lovers searching for each other), but moreso, it's August's relationship to music, how he hears/experiences it wherever he goes, that I find interesting and inspirational. As a writer, it's hard to tell others what words mean to me, so often I tell them to watch this movie to get an idea.",1510444800,,472,4.630952380952381

3113621,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This is one of my favorite ""feel good"" movies.  It's a love story told from the perspective of the three lead characters, who share their love of music: the orphan who believes his parents are alive and that his music will bring them together, the mother who thinks her son died at birth, and the father who got separated from his true love when her parents moved the family away, and he has almost given up hope that he'll ever find her.  It has that magic feeling that reminds me of being a kid and going to Disneyland.  Very heartfelt story with a bit of a fantasy flavor. It's a bit like ""Oliver"" with Robin Williams playing the Fagan role.  Although it's predictable, I enjoy the way the story unfolds.",1494892800,,707,4.415384615384616
3113622,3,B0013K7ZUE,"OK of you like a warm, fuzzy Hallmark type movie. You pretty much know right from the beginning everything will turn out ok. I liked the guitar playing and the music sections. The rest was over the top sugar coated.",1494806400,,215,4.4

3113631,5,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is a story both of excellent music and of the journeys of the human heart.  I won't spoil the movie for others by getting too deeply into the plot, but is well crafted and intricate.  Some of the guitar work is among the most innovative and startling of any that I've heard in 60 years of interest in the instrument.  August's organ solo and major symphonic debut piece might send chills down your spine.

Freddy Highmore is brilliant in the title role (a pseudonym from his street life in New York City).  He is well supported by Keri Russell as Lyla Novachek -- his mother --  Jonathon Rhys Meyers as Louis Connolly -- Lyla's lover for just one night and the father of August-- and Robin Williams as Maxwell ""Wizard"" Wallace, a small-time promoter and con artist who tries to exploit August in a ring of NYC panhandling kids to rival anything from David Copperfield. There is no way this intricate fantasy of a lost child prodigy can be regarded as low-key.  But it will engage and entrance you.",1492819200,,1009,4.541436464088398

The kicker is that the parts clipped out have benn included as ""extra"" features - really! So you get the ""whole "" movie included but good luck putting the clips back in. Same amount of recording time, not the same great movie. If you like watching an entire movie, this is not it - save your money for a better product!",1487894400,,567,4.40952380952381

After trying for 30 minutes, my family and I finally gave up as when the movie would play, it was completely pixelated and we simply couldn't watch it. We tried rebooting internet connection, buffering, nothing worked and we had very good internet signal. Usually when this happens, amazon is great at contacting via email to apologize and refund the charge, but sadly this didn't happen this time. Pretty disappointed in amazon with this one.

3113798,3,B0013K7ZUE,"I rented it the first time, it tugged at my heart strings. Then I bought it, re-watched, and felt it to be a poorly developed and simply preposterous story line. The kid being THAT much of a prodigy that he could be told what notes are then suddenly (same day and no further education) knows how to WRITE all the music on the wall was sheer ridiculocity. They could have put in things that required leaps of faith but not pure impossibilities and accomplished the same willing suspension of disbelief that carries the audience. This movie asked me to think of this boy as inhuman, which decreased the enjoyment, if only to me. I just kept thinking ""Oh come on!""",1468627200,,661,4.516666666666667

3113807,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time.  Perhaps because I'm a musician and so it is very meaningful to me.  It is a moving story about a boy who is born with an incredible gift, but is orphaned at birth.  He is convinced that if his parents hear his music they will come for him.  There is so much more to the movie than that but I don't want to ruin any of it for you!  I highly recommend this film.  Kerri Russell and Jonathan Rhys are amazing as August's incredibly talented musician parents.  Robin Williams also plays an amazing role as Maxwell ""Wizard"" Wallace, a vagrant musician who teaches homeless children music, and uses them as street musicians to make money for him.  Freddie Highmore plays Evan Taylor aka August Rush the orphaned boy searching for his parents. There are so many other amazing actors and actresses that I don't have space to name them all. I found the music in this movie to be fantastic as well and had to download the whole sound track!",1466726400,,977,4.388888888888889

3113812,5,B0013K7ZUE,"It's not a new movie, but it's extraordinary. Both a friend of mine and I (who watched the movie separately) were so moved at the end that we couldn't speak. Some of the reviewers at the time it was first released failed to grasp the point, I think. This is not fundamentally a sappy story about a family coming back together. Rather, it's a breathtaking celebration of the mystical nature of music and sound. It's effect was so powerful that everything I heard when I returned home after seeing the movie was magnified, and everything I did seemed to suddenly have a new rhythm to it.

The story line is superbly portrayed as well and is rich in imagination, colorful characters, music, artistic expression on so many levels in so many ways and where  the main characters, the unexpected happenings, and the suspense as it builds, hold your interest throughout. Finally, it is inspiring in its message that will have a different interpretation for every individual and remain hauntingly unforgettable as a tribute to hope, to music, to love, and to life itself.

This is a story about a boy who is gifted with music talent, a nautral and a genuis, who suffered adversity from birth yet became who is was meant to be regardless of what others tried to make him out to be because of his economic/social history and his musical intelligence.
This is a story of how small moments from caring adults can touch and change the life of a child in an instant.
I Strongly recommend this movie to adults and children, of all ages.
This movie is a strong reminder of how we are all connected and what you do counts!",1448150400,,658,4.272
3113974,2,B0013K7ZUE,"As a little girl, I loved going into the darkened theater to be transported by the images on the screen.  In those years, I'd surely have been enthralled by this magical story.  It would have appealed to my little girl imagination.

As an adult, however, I felt too often bored by this movie.  I understand that it's meant to be a metaphor for the ties that bind, as well as for the energies and connections in our lives that are invisible, and yet, they influence us.  Even as a metaphor, however, the movie seemed far too predictable--but again, only for an adult, because for a child, it'd be just fine.  Due to the predictable story line, the pace was often slow.  As an adult, I wanted to learn more about the parents than I did, although their acting was fine.  So was the boy's.  (As for the one villain, it really was hard to let go of how I regard Robin Williams in order to believe him in this nasty role.  I'd have preferred the casting of someone easier to picture as a flat out user.)

For a child who would genuinely wonder as the movie went along, how it'd all turn out, the pace would be just fine.  A child would likewise not notice that the boy was not actually playing the music he allegedly performed (but for this adult, me-thinks that aspect of the movie could have been far better crafted).

Even if I regard this movie as a metaphor, I am not persuaded.  I was put off by the fact that this was a fairy tale, but its setting was current reality.  That fostered too much incoherence for me, because there was no explanation for the basis of the ""magic.'  Consequently, the movie never successfully got me to suspend my sense of reality.  (To illustrate what I mean by that, even as an adult, I enjoyed the Superman movie series, which also featured ""magic"" within a realistic setting.  It worked for me, however, because the basis for Superman's magic had been well-established--so I was easily able to enter into reality suspension from the outset.)

Again, if I were a child watching this, such incoherence wouldn't even show up on my radar.  I'd simply go with the magic implied--unconsciously identifying with it as the kind of magic which naturally exists inside any child's imagination.  All children ""know"" that their parents will find them again if they are lost.  All children can believe in fantasies where playing one's own music can make an upside world become right again.

If I had children 11 or under to whom I wanted to show a movie, I'd be glad to show them this one.  I think it's a fine little family-type story---nothing stupendous, but still some wholesome entertainment.  Like a few of us dissenters here, I am thoroughly surprised that so very many adults went wild over this movie.  Had I not paid a few dollars to rent it, I really doubt I'd have stuck with it all the way through.  As it was, I paused the movie at least twice to return my reading.  I did eventually see it through to the end, but the effort was laborious.",1448064000,,2973,4.4860335195530725

3114023,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Good little family movie. Life is full of strange unexplainable/coincidental moments so it didn't really seem too out there for me and is no more or less plausible than any other movie I've seen, spiritual faith and life in general. It centered around a specific location and beyond the family's psychic connection with each other and the boys ability to know where to find them, I didn't really have to stretch my imagination. No one flew, turned blue and time didn't shift. The writers/director fit as much as they could into this movie without making it hours long and the soundtrack was great. As for the little boy, musically gifted people and those that are not can have genius children. Some people can see music like that. I know a man that sees notes as specific colors, not to mention people with forms of autism who have photographic memory and artistic talent. More than half the people who've watched this like it, so I'm thinking it's just personal taste. If you've watched this and hated it that's fine. That's life. You've tried something new and it's time to get over it. Buying or renting this movie costs less than taking a gamble at a theater, so it's really not that devastating and is more a case of self important whining. I've thrown away a few movies in my time that people thought the world of but I've never tried to stop people from making up their own minds.",1444694400,,1387,4.596774193548387

3114099,5,B0013K7ZUE,"When mention the word----music, I think it is my whole world. I began to learn the violin when I was four years old. So, everything about music all appeals to me. And August Rush is just a movie, which has music as its theme throughout the whole story.

In my perspective, the movie is highly worth to see because it full of positive energy. It can bring hope to those children who live in the orphanage and dream to find their parents. Always having faith and confidence is one of the most significant things the movie taught us. Whats more, for some people who are interested in music, especially classic music, like me, this movie can make us have a further understanding about the magic power of music. Music exists everywhere. It has life, and can lead us to close our dream.

About twelve years ago, Lyla, a young beautiful cellist encountered a handsome man by following the music. The man named Louis is also a musician. They fell in love with each other in the first sight and had a wonderful night. However, their background is so different that Lyla's father forced them to break up. Lyla was pregnant after that night. But before the baby was born, she had an accident. In order not to affect her career, Lyras father sent the baby to an orphanage and told her he already died. From then on, Lyla and Louis never saw each other again, and both of them give up their music career. Many years later, the baby grew up. He is a cute boy, and very sensible to music. Every sound in this world can become a graceful melody in his ears. He is optimistic and has a faith that his parents must be waiting for him. Therefore, he left the orphanage, and began his long journey to looking for his parents.

In the whole movie, the plot that touched me most is when August playing the guitar with Louis in the corner of a street. The boy totally doesnt know the man in front of him is just his father. However, because of music., they meet each other, because of family tie that exist come with birth, they feel uncomfortable when its time to say goodbye. In my opinion, this part is very successful, since it compounds two most important themes of this movie. We can easily feel how much power the love of music and blood relationship has.

According to all above, I think this movie suits everyone regardless of children or adult. Therefor, watching it, and you will gain a lot!",1441065600,,2379,4.4495412844036695

Have watched a lot of great movies with very talented casts, but none have ever touched me as this has. This movie is a modern, semi- believable' fairy tale love story. I have watched it more than five times and each time I watch it I fall deeper in love with the characters and the story. My top five movies in order are, August Rush, Dances with wolves, Legends of the fall, The notebook and Second hand Lions. They all involve the power of love. John Wayne is my favorite actor and Elizabeth Taylor my favorite actress. August Rush will never be removed from my top spot.

Keri was emotionally flat and her being in love with Jonathan's character seems, well, forced or suppressed.

3114311,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Freddie Highmore and Robin Williams combine for an interesting story where a young homeless boy holds onto hope that his parents will find him...all they have to do is hear his music.  Unbeknownst to him, his parents are both musicians - one a concert cellist and the other a singer in a ska band.  So the music courses through the young boy's veins.

Robin Williams skillfully plays a Fagin-like role as he leads/cares for/intimidates/profits from a group of homeless children in the city.

The music is mesmerizing, the story line is just believable enough to work, and the entire film is largely satisfying.

All in all a solid 4-star offering",1428192000,,646,4.836363636363636

3114313,2,B0013K7ZUE,"There is about 15 minutes worth of good movie, and that was at the end. The rest of it seems like a poorly organized, confusing attempt to take themes from an old Charles Dickens movie (Fagan, etc.) from Oliver Twist. Not worth the money and barely a 2 vs. 1. Not even good enough to give away, so we trashed it. The boy was good, as well as his Mother and Dad - the rest stunk.",1428192000,,378,3.986842105263158

3114356,4,B0013K7ZUE,"This movie is really awesome. I think it sends a good moral message about the beauty of life and the gift that children are. I really liked this film even though some parts of it I don't agree with (premarital sex for example), but what is interesting is that even though Lyla got pregnant, she decided to keep her child. Many people today would have told her to have an abortion or something but she kept it even though she did not have a father to raise her child with. This movie wonderfully shows the value and worth of the human person and that every child should have a chance to live. Later when Evan is grown up we as the audience are presented with a loveable character who is so gifted and talented with music, that we cant help but fall in love with his character. It is kind of sad however that such a talented and lovable kid is being raised in an orphanage when he deserves two parents who are committed in marriage. But this is seriously one of my favorite movies, its a feel good movie but at the same time it presents an accurate and realistic depiction of what happens in our society today, people don't want to have kids, people don't respect other human beings, etc, etc. This movie puts a personal character in our faces and helps us to see humanity and life for what it really is and how valuable and awesome it is to be human, and what a gift our lives are.",1425513600,,1380,4.270992366412214

Plot keeps you interested throughout the movie although parts of the story line just would not really happen in real life.

But the story, the determination, even the fears in life are spot on. My grandkids ages 5-10 not ready; maybe the 10 year old but will wait another year or 2.
So good to see Robin Williams again! A non-headlining role but always the perfect performance. Greatest lines from an obvious hard past life is his ""lecture"" to Julliard on music. Listen closely and fast. Perfect.
The kid, Freddie Highmore I think his name, have seen before The Sedgwick Chronicles and is simply GOOD in this. Why this movie did not get more of everything to get it out there is beyond me. Buy it.",1419465600,,738,4.556390977443609

3114481,3,B0013K7ZUE,"The unreality of music leading a kid to find parents he doesn't even know are alive initially made this movie too much of a stretch to take seriously.  Then we have all the musical improbabilities.  The first time the kid picks up a guitar, he starts playing a tapping, open tuned style.  But earlier we saw that same guitar tuned normally, so this would not have worked.  When Keri Russell ""plays the cello"", despite the quick edits, we can see she has no vibrato, and does not use the bow properly (except when they show someone else's hands doing it).  Jonathan Rhys Myers sings well, but his guitar chords look as if they were faked (I'm not sure about this one).  Then the kid is ""taught"" musical notation in twenty seconds by another kid, who says things like, see, it's f-a-c-e for the spaces, and e-g-b-d-f for the the lines.  How anyone who doesn't know music would have any understanding of that is bad enough, but the kid then starts writing notes on the paper, composing.  I thought he'd play the piano, but he has learned musical notation in 30 seconds.  He then starts playing the organ without ever being shown which notes on it correspond to the notes on paper.

Many people loved the music, but except for the Jonathan Rhys Myers songs, and the Kaki King guitar style, it was very unoriginal.  August's Rhapsody started with some Bach, and then included several other themes from classical and rock music.  To me it was very uninspiring, certainly nothing a young, cool musician would ever come up with.

But...despite all of this, the movie moved me at the end, and had me rooting for them all to get together, as I was overwhelmed (maybe manipulated) by the images and beauty of the ending.",1417305600,,1709,4.600660066006601

An open-tuned guitar just lying there waiting to be picked up and played--how often does that happen?
The drama around the circumstances of poverty and abandonment and estrangement from his mom by the kid served as a dark background that enhanced the difficulty of his achievements even more.

3114546,5,B0013K7ZUE,"On the surface, August Rush is a movie about a kid with amazing musical talents, in search of his parents who, due to tragic circumstances, don't know he exists. As a simple romance movie, it may seem to fall a little flat.

But August Rush is not meant to be a simple romance movie. For me, August Rush is a deeply spiritual movie about soul mates and the inter-connectedness between all things - living and non-living. The very first opening lines, spoken by the enchanting young star, Freddie Highmore, say, ""Listen. Can you hear it? The music. I can hear it everywhere. In the wind, in the air, in the light. It's all around us. All you have to do is open yourself up. All you have to do is listen."" This movie asks that of you. To really understand August Rush requires that you listen with your heart.

There are those that believe, spiritually, that God is actually everything. God is you, and me, and the flowers, trees, air, sky, etc. Scientists and mathematicians say that everything in our world - even the patterns in the air currents - can be expressed as a mathematical equation. There is even a theory now of the ""God Equation"". And of course, the connection between music and mathematics has long been studied by human beings. I believe that the creators of August Rush had all that in mind when they made this lovely movie.

Evan (Freddie Highmore) is an eleven year old boy, living at the Walden County Home For Boys - an orphanage. He doesn't fit in. His understanding of music and his unshakable belief that he can hear his parents out in the world set him apart from the other boys. They are jealous and intimidated by his faith and they lash out, calling him Freak. But Evan is undaunted, believing he gets the gift of hearing from his parents and that if he can learn to make the right music, they will hear him too.

His parents are Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), and Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). When they met, Lyla was an extraordinary cellist and Louis was the singer and lead guitarist in a rock band. They both heard the same music their son hears and they were drawn to each other in a soul mate kind of connection that led to one magical night of romance and passion (and the conception of their son).

When they awoke the next morning, they knew they were meant to be together forever. But when Lyla goes back to get her things, her father (William Sadler) comes down on her with an iron fist, stopping her from following her heart, and breaking Louis' when he sees them driving away. He leaves the band shortly after that - the music just hurts too much.

When Lyla turns out to be pregnant, her dad continues to convince her to stay for her own good. When Lyla wakes up from a frightening medical emergency that resulted in the birth of her child, her father tells her that the baby ""is gone"", leading her to believe it died. Lyla's heart is broken by the entire experience and she walks away from music, as well, becoming a teacher in Chicago.

Lyla and Louis never forget each other. They never stop sensing that something is missing from their lives. They don't know what it is, but they sense it, catching fleeting glimpses with their hearts.

Their son, however, believes completely. He runs away from the orphanage, determined to learn how to express his own music while listening for his parents to guide his journey. As all three of them open their hearts, they are drawn ever closer on an amazing journey of faith, beauty, and music that shows the patterns of inter-connectedness between the three of them (and around us all.)

I absolutely adore this movie. As a musical person and a spiritual person, August Rush speaks to me on multiple levels. I find it a joy to watch, no matter how many times I see it.

Watching the interweaving of circumstances and characters, the near misses they experience and the ways that they interact without even realizing they are doing it, moves me. I watch and I think about the patterns in my own life and the way things have worked out in seemingly mysterious ways at times. This movie makes me feel more connected to the magic all around me.

The cast is truly enjoyable. I am so impressed with Freddie Highmore. He comes across as an old soul in a young body, wise beyond his years and unafraid to believe. Terrance Howard is Richard Jeffries, the caseworker that teaches Evan to whistle and seems to be the first person who sees how special he is.

The late, great Robin Williams is Wizard - a ""broken elf"" kind of person who is an intriguing combination of light and dark. He clearly knows music, describing it to Evan as, ""God's little reminder that there's something else besides us in this universe, a harmonic connection between all living beings, everywhere, even the stars."" He is drawn to Evan because he sees that Evan knows the music too. Wizard's music was there the night that Lyla and Louis met and his influence brings Evan ever closer to his parents, even if that is not his conscious intention.

Jamia Simone Nash is Hope, an absolutely adorable girl that not only steals every scene she is in, she leads Evan to Reverand James (Mykelti Williamson). Mykelti has been a personal favorite of mine since seeing him as ""Bubba"" in Forrest Gump, and he is lovely in his small part as someone who cares deeply about Evan and his gifts, ultimately helping him to get into Julliard.

If you are a fan of music, you will certainly enjoy this movie on that level alone. But if you open up to it and listen with your heart, you just might love it the way I do.

It has a beautiful message that August says at the very beginning and very end of the movie, ""Music is all around us. All you have to do is listen."" This is basically the lesson of the story; its a beautiful lesson. The music is the most beautiful music Ive ever heard, especially August's symphony that closes the movie.

All of these emotions and needs were beautifully wrapped together by the creative developing sounds of music and melodies.  My husband and I have watched this CD whenever we found it playing on a TV channel. A visiting guest wondered how she could buy this CD. So I decided to check out Amazon. com to see if I could find the CD and order it as a surprise gift for my guest. Thank you Amazon!",1410393600,,709,4.496124031007752

The end of the movie is very inspirational! Also, it has some famous actors in it, which was surprising. NOTE: ROBIN WILLIAMS PLAYED A BAD GUY IN THE FILM, BUT DID AN EXCELLENT JOB! THE MOST GIFTED PEOPLE SOMETIMES HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS IN LIFE. HE WILL BE MISSED ALONG WITH OTHER ENTERTAINERS FROM THE PAST AND THE DECENT YOUNG ONES. I AM NOT INTO THE LATEST TV SHOWS AND MOVIES AND IF I WATCH ONE, IT HAS TO BE RATED G, PG AND MAYBE A FEW PG-13. I AM FINDING THAT THE COMMERCIALS ARE THE MOST ANNOYING WITH DRUGS, GUNS AND SEX. I HOPE SOMEONE PUTS OUT A BLOCKER FOR THEM!!! AND ""THEY"" WONDER WHY THIS IS A VIOLENT AND SEX-CRAZED COUNTRY!

A couple of the relationships between the characters are not as simple as they may initially seem. And one in particular that might appear to be one of ""taking advantage of"" needs to be looked at from all angles to see that it may be more symbiotic than you think at first.

Freddy Highmore is perfect in his role as a orphan (with a gift for hearing music in the world around him) on the loose in NYC searching for his parents. Robin Williams is oh-so believable as the less-than-honorable street musician who tries to exploit August's talent.  The story is a contrived and unbelievable - but if you view it as a fairy tale it's an highly entertaining film for adults as well as kids and may open up lots of interesting conversations.",1396828800,,516,4.537634408602151

Feels like the film ""Oliver"" to some extent, but more modern, less cloak/dagger and an inspiring love story weaved in such a way that inspires you to ""believe"" is that special something we all want to know is out there guiding our lives.

Great film, great for kids to watch (age 10+ kind of thing)

The movie truly is art in every sense of the word (the acting, the writing, the music, the filming, etc.). The only thing that I didn't like was that the whole thing is based on (small spoiler alert) the result of a hook up between two people which happens at the very beginning of the movie. I mean, seriously, if you met the man/woman of your dreams with whom you had so much in common on an emotional level, wouldn't you spend the night getting to know one another by talking rather than having unprotected sex on a roof? Call me conservative, and I know that the whole story line would be different, but I work with high schoolers and didn't like the wreck less message that this part of the story conveyed.",1395014400,,811,4.377483443708609

This is a movie for everyone-for family, for self, for anyone who loves music, who loves life, who has given up and needs a pick me up. From the very beginning I was uplifted by the music, and by the end I was crying by the music. One reviewer said this is a fairy tale, and it is-a modern day fairy tale--with everything a fairy tale needs! (Robin Williams playing a half-bad monster?) The young man who starred is just amazing. Kudos to everyone who had anything to do with 'August Rush'!",1393027200,,552,4.266666666666667

She said it was one of the best movies she had seen in years and wanted to purchase a few of them as gifts for people at church.

I think it could happen, but that is my humble opinion. Which is better, the music or the  movie? They are both equal and if you saw the theatrical version it is even better. It seems to me in this version something was cut out, but my memory could be slipping. Regardless it is a movie you should not miss.",1392336000,,479,4.150537634408602

3114981,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Music is my first love. It follows me everywhere I go, and I willingly let it. But most of the time, I am the one doing the following.

There is something about August Rush that I completely connected with. There is so much heart and soul in this film, that I become an emotional wreck ever time I watch it.

Freddie Highmore is so great! I have watched just about everything he has played in, and he continues to get better. I originally watched this movie because of Johnathan Rhys Meyers, because..well, do I really need an explanation. His voice is so, so incredibly sexy. And Robin Williams is beyond creepy in this part.

Anyways, the thought that music binds this entire family is beautiful. The way it all comes together in the end is spectacular. Again, I am an emotional wreck by the ending credits.

If you haven't seen August Rush yet, do it.",1389830400,,854,4.490322580645161

His family is also very musical. Big fan of his, he plays an awesome ""Valentine"" in ""City of Bones"".  The little boy, Freddie Highmore, Evan Taylor/August Rush does an excellent job acting in this film, as well as Keri Russell.  It is so happy when he is conducting his Rhapsody and at the end he knows he has played the music that brought his parents together and to him.  Robin Williams plays the Dark ""Olympic"" very well-I don't like it when he plays the bad guy.

I Love how they incorporated the sounds of nature and noise of the city for August to be able to put it into music!!!!  I love this movie mostly because of the music and how they show how this lonely young boy used these sounds to create such magnificent music!!!!! It was his peace, enjoyment, and the driving forces that he felt would lead him to his parents!!!!
 So Beautiful, Heartwarming, movie!!!!! The only thing I did not like is when the leader [for the homeless children ] swore!  I felt the producers did not have to add that language into this movie!  But it does show the reality of what runaways may have to endure if they make that choice to runaway, and hopefully this movie can not only uplift such Beautiful Music, but show young people, that running away is not the right choice, because even though in this movie it had a excellent ending, but in reality it does not work out in such good endings!!!!  I was very glad that that through the sounds he heard, he translated it to the most beautiful  music!!!! And I Loved how they used the music he created to find his parents who both  themselves loved music even it was different kind of music for the father!!!  This Is A Must own DVD or CD!!!!! I have not heard the CD yet, it is on it's way to my home as well as the DVD, and I FEEL THE DVD IS A EXCELLENT MOVIE [EXCEPT for the  1 or 2 swear words[s] I can not remember] it shows the reality of can happen to young people who run away! And it also shows a good ending for a very talented boy looking for his parents, and his parents looking for him!!!!  But If Nothing else would touch your heart for this movie,... the music will , and you would want to hear it over and over again!!!1  Thank You for letting me speak on this movie!!!",1388534400,,1890,4.202216066481994

Some critics miss the point, entirely. Actually, it may be more reality, than fantasy. Sometimes, people do reunite in what seem like a miracle situation. You have to open your mind. I just loved everything about the movie. The acting was good, but not overdone.  People just want to see a nice movie with people who persevere, even though as Freddie says "" They try & take away, the music"", & the desire to find, his parents. From the beginning you can tell all 3, of them know there is something missing, & strive to find, the answer. It seems most movies these days , have no ending, or you're disappointed,in the ending. August Rush had a perfect ending.",1388102400,,830,4.526666666666666

Freddie Highmore creates a wonderful character with a discovery of a hidden talent and love for music. The only thing I didn't like was his conducting style. He could have been coached much better to be more enthused and engaged in his method of utilizing the batton.

Each of the main actors had about two facial expressions through the entire movie.  It felt like watching a sub-par high school play.  To add to the bad acting, Robin Williams was cast as the arch nemesis and played the same exact role he has played in a dozen other movies (Robin Williams as himself?).  Ugh.  I am annoyed when people talk during a movie, but you could not help it with this one...there were so many funny things to comment on...and it is not a comedy.

Everything about this movie seemed contrived, forced, unbelievable and downright silly.  There could be a web-site devoted to all the plot inconsistencies that ran throughout.

On the plus side, the soundtrack was great.",1377907200,,965,4.712574850299402

As a member of a local orchestra I appreciate the classical aspects with the cellist/mother and as a woman who cannot do housecleaning with some rock n roll going in the background I like how the father/rocker finds a niche in everything around him.  Robin Williams acted his self-centered part well and it was fun to watch all the musical talent culminate.  If you listen there is music all around you -- that is no lie, and this film helps wake that feeling.  Yes, it is clich&eacute;d, but what can you do with 2 hours to weave a story?  This film does it about as best as it can be done.",1376870400,,871,4.41875

Wrong side of the tracks meets sophisticated cello player...(one caution is the immediate sleeping together but no nudity or sexual act involved.  Some cursing).

Robin Williams successfully plays the street hustler you want to like and hate at the same time.  Good acting, good storyline, great music, I think all will thoroughly enjoy.",1374019200,,543,5.056179775280899

As the movie progresses, you begin to hear August's music...the rhythm of life.  This movie captured me.  I rented it twice; shared it with a couple of other people that I know like music and finally bought it because I wanted to see it again and knew it belonged in my library of movies I like over and over again.

I'm not going to tell the story.  The story is good and it makes you want to dream again of good things.  Hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.",1372550400,,709,4.079710144927536

I was sorely mistaken, and am very glad that a friend recommended this film to me.  It has the depth you want in a great love story, but seldom find in most modern pictures.  I only wish the writers (or perhaps director?) had focused more efforts on the varying types of love capable within a family - you'll see what I mean - rather than introduce an outside business ""family"" structure as well.  But then again, maybe the contrast of the two adds to one's grasp of the familial love.  Either way, a true joy to watch as a family and as a couple.  Loved it.",1372032000,,689,4.3023255813953485

3115121,1,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush should come with a warning: you may contract diabetes from watching this movie. What a load of romantic cliches and completely irrational crap! Movies like this perpetuate the myth that a one night stand whom you never see again is really your One True Love and if you find each other again, it will be happily ever after all the way. Yeah, right. I'd like to see this couple in five years when her habit of alphabetizing the canned goods is driving him nuts, and his leaving the toilet seat up is making her crazy.

Leave your common sense at the door if your going to watch this, because you'll be asked to believe that a healthy white male baby wouldn't immediately be fought over by multiple families who want to adopt him, but would instead be placed in some mythical home for orphan boys, which hasn't existed since Oliver Twist, that a hospital system would allow a child to be given up by the mother with just a signature, and not a lengthy conversation about why she doesn't want to keep her baby, and that a grown crazy man is housing multiple street urchins who stay with him voluntarily. You'll also be asked to believe (spoiler alert - as if anyone with more than two brain cells can't figure it out from the beginning) that two people who met once will find each other, and their long-lost son eleven years later in a city of millions of people without much trouble at all. The breathless dialog and faux angst between and among characters is nauseating.

I kept looking for it to play again so I could DVR it, but it was never re-run again that I could find.  So I bought the DVD.  the music is excellent, the story, like August believes, is a fairy tale about music bringing people together.  Robin Williams is always a treat in movies like this, very talented, but not a scene stealer, he just makes all of the characters shine with him.  I recently got my first Big Screen HD TV with surround sound installed in my bedroom, so I just bought the Blue-Ray version and the Soundtrack on CD with free digital download. They both rock on my system, I'll probably have to get another copy of the Blue-Ray because I could watch it over and over again!  Just be sure to have a box of tissues handy.  It's just one of those little sleeper movies that grabs you and never lets go!  Go get it, you won't be sorry (just don't tell anyone that you don't want to know that you actually do have a heart find out!)",1367625600,,1046,4.113300492610837
3115154,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I watched August Rush for the first time on a Sunday late-afternoon while flicking through TV channels. Of course, I didn't caught it from the beginning, and that happened every time since, whenever I found it on TV. I decided to purchase the DVD, not only because I wanted to watch it in its entirety for once and for all but also because it had always touched me from the middle onwards, which was always the part caught by me.

Evan's life-journey, with the music inside him leading the way, had kind of a sad and beautiful impact on me. Another thing that allowed watching the movie from the beginning is that I was finally able to understand all the musical connections between Lyla, Louis and August. You could say that not being able to caught a movie right from the start takes some of its magic away. But in this case it was the opposite, because every time I became aware of a harmonic blending between two different performances or theme that eventually becomes part of August's Rhapsody, I couldn't help but cheering those special moments.

August Rush is a great movie all by itself. But being a musician and music lover too I felt the experience to be much greater than watching any other movie that has a complete different topic. So I recommend this DVD to anybody who'd like to witness a fairy-tale story and be soared by touching melodies.",1367539200,,1357,4.580246913580247

But then we come to the part where the kid finds this old guitar in the attic or something and immediately starts playing like Kaki King.  That's where I lost it. There is just no way this is going to happen no matter how much innate talent the kid has.  Kaki King plays her unique style on a finely tuned, custom-made instrument.  Nobody is going to pick up an old guitar and immediately sound like this.  Anyone who could believe this knows absolutely nothing about music.  There is just no way.

3115165,3,B0013K7ZUE,"Loosely based on Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, this family-friendly film tells the story of a young boy, Evan Taylor, who has grown up in an orphanage without knowing his parents. After running away from the orphanage, Evan, played by Freddie Highmore, changes his name to August Rush and begins a stint as a street musician working for a modern day Fagan named Wizard, played by Robin Williams. We are supposed to believe that Evan, now August, has an innate musical genius that allows him to hear music in the air and to pick up a guitar and immediately start playing it. He also teaches himself to read and compose musical scores in the space of an afternoon. On the basis of his musical genius, he is soon accepted into Juilliard as a twelve year old and  is asked to headline an outdoor orchestral concert in Central park. If you know the plot of Oliver twist, you can guess the outcome of this movie, as invisible forces move the characters toward its inevitable conclusion.
On the plus side, the movie is about the power of music, and features several heartfelt performances by Evan's father, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and by his mother, played by the beautiful Keri Russell.

I couldn't get this movie on Netflix or Hulu and planned to buy it with Amazon and saw the instantly option.  A huge mistake!  Huge.  In the future I will just purchase videos.  Amazon is good at purchases, but is out of its depth on the online video market.  By the way it is a great video - a terrific story.  I can't wait to watch it again when I actually have it.

The story begins with Keri Russel and Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing Lyla and Louis, 2 individuals involved in music in different ways.  Lyla is with the philharmonic and Louis is in a band.  They meet one night, have a deep connection and then Lyla is forced away by her father.  Lyla becomes pregnant and ends up in an accident.  Her father tells her the baby died, but we then turn to the baby turned into an 11 year old at a boys home.  The story then becomes about Evan (August Rush) and his journey throughout New York in order to play his music to find his parents.  There are some really great moments in the movie, but you have to be able to put doubt about Lyla hearing Evan's symphony and knowing that is her son aside and just enjoy the movie.",1361836800,,862,4.3105590062111805

It's a story of how music can affect us if we let it, how music can bring us together if we allow it to do so.  August's journey back to his parents is a lovely parable of the importance of passion in our lives, and the willingness to continue a journey even when things look their bleakest.

The parents become separated by twists of fate but in his heart he believes he actually hears the music of his parents calling out to him and pursues that feeling.

The film is charming and pulls on the heartstrings of the viewer. It's directed to your inner child. Plausibility doesn't come into play but rather we are encouraged to surrender to pure fantasy. We are also provided with an ""escape from realism"" that brings us down. It raises our spirits, giving us an emotional boost that most of us can benefit from.

All three of these actors were perfectly suited for their parts Freddie Highmore (""August"") Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Louis"") and Keri Russell (""Lyla""). Supporting actors, including Robin Williams, give very good performances as well. The music is incredible.

Will most definitely be on my favorite list. Have watched it repeatedly....LOVED IT!! every time. Even purchased the music which I rarely ever do.

In that sense it seemed reasonable to me that August ""heard"" his mother and father calling to him with music while he was living in an orphanage never having known his musician parents. Music connected them even when hopelessly separated and music brought them together in the end, proving more powerful than the greed and ambition that is in the world.

I have two children that are music majors with degrees from college and are now music teachers. This movie is about the love for music and what music means to many people.

Not all children given away turn out with such luck to find both of the parents who are still in love with each other after such seperation.  I love the way music is interperated.  Like the foreign film ""Beyond Silence"", this is my favorite children film.  Nowaday, children are so spoiled that they have no idea how their lives could possibly without their loving parents.  Many adults grow up also with the hurting child inside from the divorced or death of their parents.  This movie is very healing.  I am saving it for my mother, my boyfriend to watch.

The result is a child who the father does not know exists and the mother believes died stillborn in a car accident. In reality, the child was put up for adoption by the mother's controlling father. Now, years later, the boy August Rush is searching for parents that do not even know he exists. August, a musical prodigy who can hear music in the random sounds of everyday life, is convinced he can use his remarkable musical talent to reunite himself with the parents he has never known. He has a chance encounter with his father (neither knows who the other is) and both play guitars in a scene reminiscent of ""Dueling Banjos"" in Deliverance. In the latter half of the movie, the mother finds out from her father that her baby did not die in the car accident and she goes looking for him. But how can mother and son be reunited when neither knows the others name or location? Love of music will draw the father, the mother and the lost son together in one magical moment in space and time.

Yes, the movie is unrealistic. Yes, it has fairy tale elements. Yes, it is a combination of Oliver Twist (young orphan travels to London and meets the Artful Dodger, leader of a gang of pickpockets) and Harry Potter (young wizard orphan in search of knowledge about his dead parents). But the movie works to pull you in. The musical scenes are magical. This is a feel good movie with a happy ending.

A rollicking wreck of a script with a scary kid who might work well in a ""Friday the 13th"" movie. What's most irritating about it is that it tries so hard to be inspirational but the story about a kid with such ""talent"" that he can just pick up the guitar for the first time and play it masterfully or compose a complicated symphony that gets a huge production in NYC focusses on the glory of natural (read ""unnatural"") talents. Give me a story about someone who struggles against all odds, practicing and studying and working hard to be the best they can be. That would be inspirational.

3115328,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Now for starters, this film is very hyphy. When investors ""Keak Tha Sneak"" and ""Kool Keith"" decided to executive produce a film about music lovers, they had no idea what they were getting into. Apparently this was supposed to be a monumental film on the scale of ""Citizen Cane"" meets ""Transformers the Movie"" starring Kevin Spacey as a ten-year old orphan who discovers the magic power of death metal while being August Rushed in a cornfield. However, Spacey stepped out at the last moment to film ""Pay It Forward 2: Electric Boogaloo."" So instead we got this film about an actual orphan who directs wheat, to see how much it will yield. After meeting the pimp from ""Hustle and Flow,"" the young prodigy leaves and wanders into the woods, where he mistakes a wolf for a cello. Upon reaching the big apple, he meets Garp, who teaches him how to play acoustic versions of Tool songs on a wolf. I can't really recommend higher than five stars, because they won't allow me, but the score by Cannibal Corpse (working with famed rapper First Degree The D.E.) really boosts this film into a level of transcendence rarely seen in this era of big-budget blockbusters with no soul.

I can't actually believe how many good reviews it got, which just goes to show that one mans meet is another mans poison! I found it very sickly and just too cloying for my tastes.

The cast were great however (waste of a great cast IMO) - well except for Robin Williams who over acted commendably. Jonathon Rhys Myers was good and the child actor was amazing. Just a pity they had such a weak story to work with.

If you fancy checking it out though i would say to do so, it;s not an offensive film and obviously a lot of people really love it.

3115332,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is an eleven year old boy living in an orphanage. He has never known or met either of his parents, yet he has known most of his life that he was not supposed to be orphaned and both of his parents wanted him. He can hear things all around him, in musical tones whether it be words, wind chimes, the sound of honking horns or birds chirping, it all has a musical resonance to him. The kid is a profound musical prodigy waiting to develop. Although he has never played a musical instrument, the music is inside of him. His belief that his parents are out there somewhere and love him, as well as the music he feels his parents somehow gave to him, drives Evan to run away from the orphanage in search of them. What he finds is much more than he imagined was hiding inside of him all along.

There he meets a con artist whose street name is ""Wizard"" (Robin Williams), who once a prodigy like himself shares his ability to hear music in everything around him. Evan chances upon a guitar and masterfully begins to play as his natural talent becomes quite evident. ""Wizard"" changes Evan's name to ""August Rush"", partly to promote the boy's talent, and partly to disguise him as he learns Evan is a runaway and there is a search being conducted to find him. Through a course of events, the two are seperated and Evan (now ""August"") hides out in a church orphanage where his talent is quickly discovered and he is soon enrolled at Juliard School of Music where he composes a masterpiece the school solicits the New York Symphony Orchestra to perform.

Evan's parents were Lyla Novacek (Keli Russell) who at the time was an accomplished Cellist with the New York Symphony, and Louis Conelly (the very talented Jonathan Rhys Meyers) an Irish singer and songwriter, who met on one magical night in New York and fell deeply in love with each other. Due to horrible circumstances the two never met again. Both talented musicians left their field of music and pursued other avenues of life. One in San Francisco, the other in Chicago, far from the child neither one knows even exists. Can the faith that drives a child who thinks he can hear his parents through the music they gave him, possibly compose a reconnection of these three lives?

This movie is fantasy, and oftentimes throughout, it suffers moments of great lack of reality, nevertheless by then the viewers attention is captured in the awe of it's magic, and reality is no longer expected. The film is charming and pulls on the heart of the viewer to let go and believe in fairy tales. The music in this film is incredible. Highmore (""August"") gives a stellar performance of his character and steals the show completely. Not far behind him is the performance of Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Louis"") and Keli Russell (""Lyla""). All three of these actors were perfectly suited for the part in which they were cast, performing with incredible feeling and unique talent. The well orchestrated cast of supporting actors, including Robin Williams, give very good performances of their characters as well, bringing the script together in perfect harmony.

The DVD offers a scene selection feature as well as a few additional scenes which were edited out of the production. Most of these scenes fit perfectly into the script and a couple of them would have been helpful in their original place. The only negative I can give this film is that the ending was rather disappointing. It builds up for 113 minutes and just as the viewer is expecting to see the end result of a masterful script, the movie ends abruptly. The rest is left to your own imagination. Although it was all spelled out, and the right characters were in place for the moment they belonged in, the film does not deliver the visual crescendo the viewer is longing for. The audience is left screaming for an encore that is never given. I suppose the point was for the viewer to hear the music within themselves, nevertheless it would have been much more satisfying to have actually SEEN it!

A young orphan boy tries to find his parents. He ends up lost/homeless on the street. He is taken in by a pied-piper of young street musicians, who lives in a run down abandoned building. His parents had a love-at-1st-sight experience, but were pulled in different directions. I won't give the storyline away, but his mom didn't know he was alive. His dad never knew he existed. The boy knew that his mom and dad loved him and were trying to find him. He felt the only way he could find them was to create music so that they could hear it...and then they would find him.

I really appreciate how this movie takes you through several different levels of art/music: amateur, sophisticated,  orchestra, rock, blues, self-taught, refined, gritty street, gospel, etc.

In addition to what I thought were generally extremely limited acting skills, he displayed virtually no change of emotion throughout the entire movie, for which I blame the director. Being upbeat and hopeful are nice virtues to be sure, but this was ridiculous. And what kid, who is supposedly a musical prodigy no less, in his right mind would trade a free Julliard education to go back with Wizard? That was a patently stupid contrivance apparently used solely to extend the running time and ramp up the tension for the even sillier contrivance that brings them all together. Speaking of Julliard, do they routinely enroll homeless orphans who possess no identifying paperwork at all? Is that even legal?  Were they appointed his legal guardian by some competent authority or did they just assume the role on their own? Not one character in this movie came across as resembling a real human being in my opinion.

3115343,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I have read some 1 star reviews saying this is in no way a 5 star movie. These reviewers, if you read them are obviously music teachers or musicians that are the epitome of the bully in the orphanage. They have issues and can't accept that it's a movie and is fantasy. It is not based off real people. These people would try to force anyone with talent better than themselves to deny that talent out of jealousy. Fine, it is very exagerated that our boy can pick up sheet music and just know how to read it and compose a song in less than 1 day but like I said. It's a movie.
On to the review:
I love this movie. I am not going to start flashing names of artists they were copying for Freddie Highmore's style of playing but there are originators of it out there for longer than you think.
As we begin, we have Evan - Aka August Rush (Freddie Highmore) in an orphanage and he is bullied for being different. Flash to 11 yrs earlier to Keri Russell (Celebrated Julliard celloist) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (budding Rock star) meeting and having a one night stand. Keri is controlled by her father William Sadler so the relationship doesn't take off.
Back to Evan in the present - He leaves to find his parents by ""following"" the music.
Terence Howard is the child services rep trying to find him.
Robin Williams is the person who takes him in which is the ""Oliver Twist"" part. He gives Evan the name August Rush as a stage name but also to hide him from the authorities in order to use his talents. Not his best work but the character was not supposed to be outright violent or dangerous. He is a guy that you just don't know how off his rocker he is or how violent he COULD be.
The rest of the movie is a show of the close calls of the father, mother and Evan coming so close to meeting it will make you almost cry. You spend the movie beginning to believe that as long as Evan is playing, his mother and father will find him.
If you have no hope, don't watch it. Or, better yet, you should be watching it.",1297728000,,2005,4.196891191709844

He absolutely adores everything that has to do with music and this passion of his takes him on a quest for the two aspects he misses the most in life: his parents and a fair chance to play and enjoy music. As for the acting, the sweet and sincere leading character gives an amazing performance. Still, it's the high quality melodies that make this movie really stand apart.

The following sentence heard in the film sums up it's main message: ""Just listen!"" This is a great piece of advice for everyone living in our stressed up world today. How often do we ignore or neglect all the gentle voices around us: the singing of birds, the sounds of wind and the expressed honest hopes and expectations of the people around us.",1294444800,,844,4.48051948051948

3115348,1,B0013K7ZUE,"This is a review of the movie--not the DVD.

I first want to comment how astounding it is that the audience ""Fresh"" rating on Rottentomatoes.com for this movie is over 80%, whereas the critics have provided less than 35% positive reviews.  This is one where the audience needs to pull its head out of its rear and realize that a cute kid, a pretty actress, Robin Williams, and the IDEA of a good story do not a good movie make.

The concept of a wanted-but-lost child who is a musical prodigy searching for his parents, and entering into said concept as the audience with the faint promise of a happy ending, is all more than okay with me.  The problems I have is how much farther the movie demands I stretch the license I give it to ignore reality.  I'll buy that this kid can ""hear"" his parents, that he's the most gifted musical prodigy to have ever been born, that his grandfather is a mean and selfish man to the point of secretly giving the kid up for adoption, that somehow two people know they're ""meant for each other"" after a one-night-stand, and even (spoiler alert) that the boy can turn around at the end of his concert and see his parents and immediately know who they are.

I will not, however, buy that he can sight-read sheet music after a 7-year-old girl shows him what a quarter note is, or that an inner-city pastor can walk a kid through the front doors of Juilliard and get him enrolled in classes, or that such a young boy would be allowed to participate in such a high-profile concert when no one even knows who his parents are.  Also unforgiveable is the editing during the musical scenes, where the camera doesn't stop panning.  It's unforgiveable because 1) it's irritating, and 2) it's quickly obvious that the purpose is to try to distract you from the fact that the filmmakers couldn't be troubled to hire a very good musical consultant.  If you're a guitarist like me, or really any kind of musician, watching Evan and others ""play"" guitar is painful.  You hear solo parts when all the actors are doing is strumming, or hear the guitarist slide up on the neck and the actors move down, if at all.  Then there's the part when Evan touches a piano for the first time--it's clear as day that it's the wrong note.  And this isn't a perfect pitch kind of thing--the kid was not even at the right octave.  How is it that someone decides to make a movie that is built around music but can't be bothered to make it appear that the instruments are actually being played?

Like I said, the concept of the movie sounds beautiful, but its execution is gut-wrenching.",1291248000,,2585,4.472340425531915

3115352,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Loosely based on Dickins' ""Oliver Twist,"" Freddie Highmore plays a young boy lost in New York's childcare system, searching for his parents, who gave him up.  He runs away from the boys' home he grew up in, abused by the other kids, not the adults, who genuinely care for him.

Highmore has a gift of music, inherited from both his parents, and is quickly picked up by a Fagan like character played by Robin Williams, who sends kids out into Washington Square Park playing music for money.

Meanwhile, the boy's mother finds out that her son is still alive (she was lied to by her father, who forged her signature on the papers, giving him up.)  How the doctors and hospital went along with this is never explained, but the mother gives a decent performance, yelling at her father on his deathbed, ""Where is he?""  She goes to see child care services, who after running her through red-tape, finally help her try to track down her missing son.

Williams learns the state is looking for ""Evan"", and changes the boy's name to ""August Rush,"" a stage name.  The boy is quickly discovered by a priest who takes him to Juliard, and the boy is revealed to be a musical prodigy.

The tale follows Oliver Twist; Williams reclaims the boy from the school, claiming to be his father.  In the park, Freddie meets his real father, who convinces him to go to the planned concert anyway.  There, both parents are called by their son's music, and the mother recognizes him on stage from his photograph.

3115366,5,B0013K7ZUE,"The parallels between this movie and Oliver, which have been pointed out by other reviewers, in no way detracts from the charm of this movie. The story of a young boy who has been left to his own resources, and discovers a haven called music is inspiring and dramatic; I can most specifically relate to using music has a source of hope and promise as a boy!

The story proceeds with a series of flashbacks that explain how the situation developed that put our talented hero in an orphanage. His love of music, which was strictly generated within him, serves as a focal point for living that helps compensate for the difficulties which life has placed before him.

August is blessed with a remarkable talent for music that places him in the child prodigy category. Having no one that cares enough to help him, he must find music in all that surrounds him; as he listens to the ordinary sounds of life he translates that into music in his mind.

A basic part of his belief system is a complete, unshakable confidence that his parents love him and want him back. This notion is ridiculed by the other boys in the orphanage but his confidence is not compromised by that.

The story takes a big turn when August, who is actually named Evan Taylor, decides to follow the music and finds himself in the totally strange surroundings of New York City. This is where a boy street musician, the ""Artful Dodger"" character, befriends him and takes him to meet the ""Fagin"" character who in this story is called The Wizard, very well played by Robin Williams.

The pace of the story picks up from this point onward; the lives of all three, the mother, Lyla, played by Keri Russell, the father, Louis, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the son, August/Evan, played by Freddie Highmore are being drawn together by their shared love of music. I will only say that the ending does not disappoint!

The copy we watched last night was loaned to us by a friend; I placed an order for a copy of our own this morning with Amazon. I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. By the way, the sound on the disc is very good; there are instrumental solos including a pipe organ that sound fabulous, as well as an unusual blending of rock and classical music used to show the dramatically different lives lead by Lyla and Louis.

We thoroughly enjoyed the movie and found it captivating!",1276473600,,2364,4.561320754716981

I'm not an expert critic or even a musician but this movie kept my attention and I found it to be just a good movie for all ages to watch. I know its not all real but I guess just allowing my imagination to flow with the movie and with the characters in the movie I found it to be entertaining and well worth owning and watching over and over again. Too bad for those that are so serious about their music that found this movie offensive and unbelievable.  I'm not one of them I just liked the movie and the music no mater how not real some parts may have been thats the beauty of it for me.

3115371,5,B0013K7ZUE,"First I have to say I LOVE this movie.  I am somewhat cynical and rough around the edges, but this movie got to me.  ""August Rush"" is lovely fairy tale about a little boy, Evan Taylor, who has grown up in a state home, who is a musical prodigy.  Unbeknownst to him, he is the son of two musically gifted parents (played by the wonderful Kerri Russell and the brilliant Jonathan Rhys-Myers.  Evan is convinced he is still loved and wanted by his parents, and rightfully, as his mom was tricked into giving him up by her duplicitous father.  We meet the young lovers who connect on a rooftop, discussing music and the connection it is in their lives, only to be spearated.  Evan is sent away, his mother thinking he died in her emergency delivery.  Evan think he can reach them through music and he hears music in the most mundane of sounds.  The opening is a bluray delight(between image and audio) with Evan ""conducting"" the wheat colored fields of his orphanage as the wind pours through it.  He runs away one night to find his parent, convinced if he can play his music where it can be heard they will find him.  He meets a street grifter (a wonderfully dispicable Robin Williams) who tries to exploit his gifts to line his pockets and even gives him the stage name of August Rush.

The movie relies on a lot of coincidences and leaps in credibility, but the fairy tale tenor of the story makes this permissible as we feel we are watching a fable, but the genius of the movie is the realistic look and feel of the film and characters.  Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) is brilliant.  The film is set on his shoulders and he delivers.  He is winning, lovable, and as an actor, Highnmore has a poise well beyond his years.  The film is by turns, funny, aching, lyrical, and ultimately it has its moments of sheer joy, and it earns every one of them.

The films was a must-have for me on Blu-ray between the gorgeous cinematography and fabulous meoldic score by Mark Macina.  The film is stunning in 1080p.  There is not a single flaw on the print or the high-def transfer.  Blacks are inky, colors have wonderful saturation, and there is a light veneer or grain in the image retaining the film-like look.  The Dolby TrueHD sound is a revelation, as opposed to the lossy standard track.  The scene where August plays his rhapsody the church organ is booming, exciting, with enormous detail added.  This is a fine example of how high def only enhances and serves the story rather than special effects and explosions.  The current price of this disc makes it a no brainer if you are a fan of the film.  To those new to it, this is the way to see it.  It's perfectly suitable for children (my 8 yr old LOVED it), although it is not a children's movie.  Highest recommendation.",1274400000,,2811,4.495069033530572
3115372,5,B0013K7ZUE,"What a nice movie, a pleasant film.  There are lots of twists and turns in this, and I kept waiting for the Hollywood version of the Greek tragedy, but it didn't happen.  This flick will leave you smiling and maybe even a bit misty eyed, a great one to watch with your spouse or SO.

Music is the backdrop, and the acting is as superb as the story is improbable.  For once Robin Williams doesn't dominate the scenes but plays the part of the benevolent scoundrel, who you'd love to hate, but can't. Freddie Highmore, the ""orphan,"" will steal your heart and you keep rooting for him as he squirms and wriggles through one musical scene after another trying to locate the parents he is convinced are still alive - parents who all the officials assure him are no longer around.

The story will suck you in, the music, a seemingly wacky combination of classical, street and pop, will entertain you and you'll not want any interruptions while you enjoy the story. Very difficult not to rate as five-stars !!",1273708800,,1002,4.544444444444444

The plot, the actors, the music, the journey is just right for me.

It immediately jumped to my Top-5 all-time, and I consider this the Wizard Of Oz of movies about music.

There was a connection between them the second they met and on that day a musical genius was conceived. The day she gave birth, Lyla's father made a choice that he claimed was for both of them, but it was really a selfish decision. Lyla no longer had her son and she was separated from Louis.
Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) listened to sounds of the wind, city streets, etc and he would hear music. He was in a home for boys where his gift was not appeciated because they saw him as freakishly different. He wanted to be with his birth parents, not placed in someone's home. He had no anger because they gave him up, but was consumed with thoughts of where they could possibly be and he kept believing he could follow the music that would lead him to them.
I enjoyed August Rush. Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams)bothered me a bit, though. He acted like he cared about Evan but he didn't really want this boy to be happy. He deceived him and tried to fill his mind with doubt. Wizard's thinking was all messed up because he was scarred by the foster care system. He lived in an abandoned theater with homeless children he was supposedly taking care of but he was really using them.

3115399,1,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush was the cinematic equivalent of drinking straight from a bottle of Karo corn syrup.
First of all, the kid's style of guitar playing is strongly reminiscent of the late Michael Hedges so if you like that sound - and it is a very cool sound - try listening to the real thing and buy a Michael Hedges CD or go watch some of his video on YouTube.

Ok, now the ugly part... I'm a 54 year-old musician who believes music can found everywhere (one of this movie's themes).  I really related to the early part of the movie ""August"" is hearing melody and rhythm in various natural sounds (like the wind blowing through a field of grain)  When I was a teenager, long before the advent of sampling, I used to hear music in steam vents at an asphalt factory I worked at on the Pugent Sound.  I wanted to find a way to capture and execute that sound on strips of recording tape triggered by a keyboard (similar to a Mellotron in mechanics). I really do get the idea.  But then the movie disintegrates into a series of sappy situations and ""awakening"" events that are just too far fetched; this was perhaps the lamest, sappiest and most unbelievable drivel I have ever watched in my life.  Come on, did a junior high school drama enthusiast write this screenplay?

A good movie, especially fiction, has to find a way to suspend belief.  August Rush fails miserably. Sure, a savant could start playing an instrument almost immediately.  But a savant (even Mozart) couldn't sit down and start writing musical notation without even 5 minutes of study to understand the lexicon used.  That's just preposterous.  And even if the kid could do that impossible feat, how would he know the ranges and tunings of the various instruments when writing those parts.

It's too bad because with just a modicum of care and research this movie actually could have been made a little more believable.  The idea about music being every where really intrigued me and that's why I watched it.  August Rush was simply awful and an ordeal - a whirlpool of Karo corn syrup.  Yuck.

A captivating and well written story about two musicians who fall in love and a child with outstanding talent will conform an amusing and heartfelt canvas that will capture your heart without concessions.

Robin Williams is superb as the merciless mercenary of the low depths, who just wants to see money and a lot of fruitful opportunities around this hyper talented teenager.

And for those of us that are musicians, it captures the some of the magical effect that music can hold for the performer/listener. The performances, both acting and musical, are excellent...especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who is as gifted in real life as the main character.

Granted, over dramatized unrealistic fantasy is a game Hollywood has been playing ever since the motion picture industry was invented, I really felt the makers of this movie ran with it and managed to take it to the next level.  Aside from totally unbelievable yet predictable plot line, this movie seems to forget the reality that any serious musicians come to terms with - music is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  What's more, this movie seems to reinvent the term 'musical prodigy' as some kind of a monster who could play anything he hears in his head w/out any type of training.  I watched this film b/c few people mentioned it to me b/c I'm a guitar player.  I really regret renting it and having to sit through it.  I guess if I weren't a musician, I might have enjoyed it a little more.  But, I was really turned off by this movie b/c it was a total misrepresentation of how real music works.

Years before his parents had also been brought together when both ""heard the music"" as they were playing in two seperate concerts. As this movie progresses music continues to play as an important role as August learns how to play a guitar simply by looking at another kid playing, finds out how to write music, and finally writes his own rhapsody. As August is improving his ability and sharing his talent, his parents are each on a journey to discover they're love of music again.

It has a really great story, even though a lot of it is hard to believe. Like the fact that the boy never had any musical training, but can pick up a guitar for the first time and automatically just start playing it like a pro, or how he had never seen a note written down before in his life yet somehow is able to write an entire musical score in a half a days time.

I do want to say that the music in it is amazing. Very catchy, yet emotionally powerful.

All the same, this is a great family movie which is enjoyable and fun to watch as long as you don't pay too much attention to how impossible some of what happens really is. But hey, what else is fiction for other then to suspend reality a little bit?",1246233600,,884,4.017045454545454

Of course it would it not only be improbable, but preposterous for the story told in August Rush to happen in reality. Who cares? Is that the point of the movie? Not at all! The point is to rouse our child-like imagination and to unleash potential and motivate us to dream.

Evan is an 11 year boy, who lived all his life in an adoption agency, waiting all his life to find his parents, whom he is sure love him and can't wait to see him.
He listens to all the musical sounds in nature, which he believes will help him find his parents. His parents did not know he even existed, but they always sensed a feeling in the air that he does. He follows the music until he reaches New York. He learns how to play music there until he develops into becoming a genius musician. He joins one of the best music school there. After a short while he becomes a professional music compser. One night he composes music infront of thousands of people, turns his back and finds his parents looking at him with pride and love, and they finally get back together with him after long 11 years.

This movie is magnificent. The story is very original, the casting is great, and its very emotional and touchy as well.

A movie about the very precious relationship betwen parents and their children, particularly between a mother and her child.
We take our parents for granted, however there are many people who would wish to spend 1 day with their parents, when they can't.

Love your parents. Give them the care and love they deserve. You will not know how much they love you until you yourself become a parent.

3115435,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I have all of Alex O'Loughlin's work on DVD, so of course I had to add August Rush. I had seen it in the theater after discovering Alex on Moonlight. Alex would have been cast as the lead of this film, but was told that a ""bigger name"" was needed. Alex was still fairly new to the industry in the US after being a leading man in Australia. I admire his bravery, coming to the US and basically starting over from scratch. He is a brilliant talent, and should have had the lead in this movie. Since JRM was chosen due to his ""bigger name"", the part of Marshall Connelly was made larger for Alex since he made such an impression. In my opinion, as always, Alex outshines everyone else in this film. I saw it at the theater and then bought the DVD - just for Alex. Alex is Australian and can do any accent - his Irish accent as Marshall is impeccable. I actually have a friend who is Irish, and she said that it was funny that Alex's accent was better than JRM's, since JRM is Irish.  Alex also plays his own guitar and sings in the scenes where they show the brothers' band days, and his talent shines through there as well.
I have known people who didn't know who Alex was when they saw August Rush (Moonlight had just premiered. Then when they did see him in Moonlight and in some of his other movies later, they said, ""oh, that's the guy I liked so much in August Rush!"" No matter how small the part, Alex always makes an unforgettable impression.

I tend to see that kind of thing as a gift from God.  Do people hear music in every day living through ordinary sounds?  Of course.  I suggest that one not overthink this film.  It's not that kind of movie.  It's quite a fanciful tale but it really is very enjoyable.  Jonathan Rhys Myers is always wonderful and he does not disappoint here.  Robin williams is also very effective.  The music in this movie is eclectic.  If you don't like one tune you're bound to like one of the others.  This film took me by surprise.  There's no use in describing it to you.  Just read the synopsis and then view the film.  I found it quite interesting and men will probably see it as a ""chick flick.""  Okay,so, no harm done.

August Rush: [opening voice-over] Listen. Can you hear it? The music. I can hear it everywhere. In the wind... in the air... in the light. It's all around us. All you have to do is open yourself up. All you have to do... is listen.
=============================

August Rush is a fairy tale of a film, a really inspiring story of a boy in an orphanage who dreams of finding his parents--hearing music in the world and also inside himself that leads him ever onward in his quest. Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) likes music ""more than food"" and he has talent to burn. He is a musical prodigy with an incredible gift.

He goes to New York where, drawn to the music, he finds the lair of Wizard (Robin Williams)--a Fagin-like entrepenuer, but instead of grooming pickpockets like Aftful Dodger, he grooms buskers like Arthur (Leon Thomas III). Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace is a complex character, creepy and malevolent--but not entirely evil as he does believe in the power and grace of music. It is just that, when faced with someone as talented as Evan, he can't resist the temptation to exploit his talent. He does, however, give the boy a guitar and a flashy stage name: August Rush.

--------------
Wizard: You know what music is? God's little reminder that there's something else besides us in this universe, a harmonic connection between all living beings, every where, even the stars.
======================

Robin Williams, master of comedy, is also adept at playing creepy sociopaths, such as Seymour Parrish in One Hour Photo or Rainbow Randolph in Death to Smoochy. His Wizard is perhaps his best creepy sociopath yet, and he wins the best of show award here.

Meanwhile, Evan's mother Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), a cellist, is trying to find him, and his father, Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is trying to find Lyla. Louis is also a musician, naturally, and he sings and plays bass in a rock band. When the cops try to take down Wizard's squat, August rushes off and seeks sanctuary in a Gospel church. He hears some really good Gospel singing there, especially from a young girl named Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). She teaches him to read music, and about one second later he starts writing his Opus One, August's Rhapsody in C Major. Hope sees his music and goes to tell the Reverand about it. When they find him at the church organ, they hear his obvious talent and send him immediately to Julliard.

If this all sounds a little hard to swallow, it isn't. The film spins its fairy tale with such finesse that you are perfectly willing to suspend your disbelief. The music is great, especially the parts where August Rush discovers the guitar. Some really great singing by Jamia Simone Nash and Leon Thomas III, who both, by the way, have sung on The Backyardigans (who are HUGE to the toddler crowd, just ask my great nephew, Casson Hunter Porter). I wondered if Leon Thomas III was related to Leon Thomas who is known for his work with Pharoah Sanders, particularly the 1969 song ""The Creator Has a Master Plan"" from Sanders' Karma album. Thomas's most distinctive device was that he often broke out into yodeling. This style influenced James Moody and Tim Buckley, among others. It would have made for a really good story, but apparently the two Leon Thomases are not related.

Nevertheless, August Rush is quite inspiring, and fun for the whole family. Freddie Highmore did a fantastic job as August Rush, and I see that he was also Charlie Bucket in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Peter Llewelyn Davies in Finding Neverland--both with Johnny Depp. Add to that August Rush, and the young Mr. Highmore has made quite an impressive fairy tale triptych.

August Rush: Sometimes the world tries ot knock it out of you. But I believe in music the way that some people believe in fairy tales. I like to imagine that what I hear came from my mother and father. Maybe the notes I hear, are the same ones they heard, the night they met. Maybe that's how they found each other. Maybe that's how they'll find me. I believe that once upon a time, long ago, they heard the music and followed it.

I could feel his joy as he first played the guitar.... and as he first played the pipe organ, each with the skill seemingly gathered over years of time.  I wouldn't want to say too much about the story as you should experience it as I did, with little knowledge of the plot.  Just know that, if you enjoy music to any extent, this movie will captivate you, as it did me....",1232755200,,535,4.028301886792453

I had to turn it off at about the hour mark when the kid, upon getting his hands on a guitar for the first time, banged out music worthy of a skilled musician. Even used a piano style technique on the fretboard that would at least have gotten a nod from Eddie Van Halen. Please, give me a break. I get it. It's a fantasy. Maybe science fiction? Of course it takes hours of study and effort to get anything resembling music out of any instrument. Ok, maybe not a kazoo. I guess the sale of musical instruments will skyrocket now. If it left you with a warm and fuzzy feeling, I think that's great. Good luck when your child, expecting similar miraculous results, entertains you with their new electric guitar - or better yet, new violin.",1231632000,,886,4.279761904761905

3115463,4,B0013K7ZUE,"OK--this is a feel good movie and it was clean enough that I could watch it with my kids without having to fastforward which is always a bonus.

And I wanted to love the storyline. I just couldn't get myself to do it. It was like a really good cinematographer who decided to let his girlfriend write the script not because she could write, but because he truly loved her.

Others have pointed out all of the ""miracles"" that keep happening to make this movie have a happy ending. With just a tweak here and there it would have been better. The evil Dad could have been shown paying off the Irish musician to leave the daughter alone. And why has a perfectly normal kid been left without any kind of at least a foster home from infancy or did I miss that part? Just a few changes--storyline would have been better.

However, the idea that music is in the world all around us was just brilliantly portrayed. I also loved all of the music that was performed and so that more than made up for the nonsense.

A great movie--just leave your ideas of reality at the door before watching it.",1231545600,,1082,4.341584158415841
3115464,4,B0013K7ZUE,"This is a different sort of movie for me.  I tend to prefer movies with great dialogue and watertight plots - and this movie, although it has some important dialogue, is also significant for the dialogue that it leaves out.  It also has a plot that is so surrealistic that it requires suspension of belief.  And the montages, as everyone is rushing towards the concert in Central Park, are beautiful but I can't help asking things like, ""How did Mr. Jeffries get there in time?  Where was August's tuxedo?""

It was also interesting to watch the scenes which were deleted.  They contained talk and exposition - but the movie is a fairytale which requires faith rather than logic.  Another missing scene (not one of the deleted) why didn't Lyla, Louis and August say anything to each other at the end?  The answer was that words were insufficient - music and video had to capture what could not be expressed in words.

I recommend that watchers put aside their attachment to wit and logical consistency and pay attention to what works in the film. The film has the interesting premise that the universe is connected to each other through sound and music.  (I think it might be connected on other dimensions as well.)  We just need to listen, and we might become aware.

And, if you watch the movie carefully, you will pick up certain gems.  For example, it is Wiz playing down below when Lyla and Louis spend their only night together.  The expressiveness of the faces of the actors who play Louis and August are absolutley fabulous.  The one real musician - the girl who plays Hope - makes our spirits soar when she sings.

Appreciating this film requires a different approach.  It's like having to stand back when looking at paintings by Monet and Renoir.  It's not the same as appreciating the work of a photographer - but the film is beautiful and can give you a rewarding and illuminating experience.",1231372800,,1903,4.663663663663663

3115466,1,B0013K7ZUE,"So, so bad.  Sort of a ""Oliver Twist"" - boy deprived of his rightful destiny, in this case musical genius; and his misadventures while ""following the music"".  The film had so many plot holes that made it absolutely impossible to buy into the story.  I never believed from the get go that the two musicians fell in love, that they could never have found each other earlier, that a baby could be born and given to an orphanage without the mother's consent or even knowing what really happended, etc. etc.
The dialouge was insipid and contrived; the dialouge during the scene where the two musicians have their once in life time one night stand;actually made me cringe it was so melodramatic and stupid.
This movie is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen because of it's pretentiousness while it actually insults the intelligence of its audience.",1230940800,,852,4.782312925170068
3115467,1,B0013K7ZUE,"We rented this movie after my sister said it was her favorite movie of '08.  I found it completely unrealistic.  I wonder if anyone really musical was involved in creating the storyline of this movie.
One major flaw was Lyla's special invitation to be a featured performer after 11 years of not really playing the cello.  Is there a Julliard graduate out there who can confirm that after such a long lapse in practicing, there is any way that Lyla can brush up in (what appeared to be) a week, and give a stunning performance to a discerning audience?
Another impossibility is Evan/August's theory progress in one day.  It doesn't matter how amazing your genes are, you will not be writing 16th notes and more in your first day of composing if you've only been introduced to basic quarter notes in a beginner piano book.  How absurd!  And speaking of genes, although his parents were gifted musicians, Evan had ZERO exposure to music except in-utero and out in nature(??) until he was 11.  A musical prodigy may have musical genes, but is also heavily exposed to music.  Mozart began playing the harpsichord at age 3 and didn't begin composing until about 6.  He did not hop on the piano the first day and compose.
Just two examples of many absurdities.  Perhaps the greatest is the idea of two people pining after each other for 11 years after a one-night-stand.  Is this really ""great for the whole family?""  I found myself relating to Lyla's dad (being protective after the party-not forging signatures and lying), who was made out to be a villain in the movie.
I do think the boy did a great job acting.",1230768000,,1607,4.619718309859155

This phony, complacent, overwrought dreck lacks even that redeeming value.  If a cloying pastiche of clichs like ""August Rush"" doesn't insult your intelligence, nothing will.

Freddie Highmore is a talented child actor.  If you're a fan, you'd do better to catch his performance in ""Finding Neverland,"" a film worth watching.",1229990400,,600,5.0
3115471,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Freddie Highmore is wonderful as August Rush.  I can tell that the producers of this movie are huge fans of the movie Show Boat, particularly the 1936 version starring Irene Dunne.  The 1936 version departs from the book and other versions of the movie and the play, but it is considered the classic version of Show Boat.  I am a classic movie lover myself, and this movie is part of my video collection.  The relationship between the couples in both movies share common elements.  The naive, sheltered girl falls for the guy from the opposite side of the track.  Both have a talent for the stage.  She has an overbearing, overprotective parent.  The couple separate.  Years pass.  The child follows in the parents' footsteps.  The couple reunite in the audience on their child's big night on stage.  The movies even end the same way in the final scene.  The music in both is top notch.  There are other similarities, but there are also differences.  The big difference is that the child in Show Boat is always with the mother, but the child here is an orphan, and this movie centers around his efforts to find and reunite with his parents.

It was a regular unmarked blank that had a very good copy of the movie recorded on it. If it did not come from Amazon I would have assumed it was an illegal copy. I had to identify it with  a marker so it would not get mixed up with my many back up DVD copies of stuff I keep on my computer. Very strange.,1229731200,,447,3.806451612903226

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Boy musician (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meets girl musician (Keri Russell) and they make beautiful music up on the roof before going their separate ways
2. Little orphan boy (Freddie Highmore) hears music in the wind and feels a connection to the parents he never knew
3. Desperately seeking parents, he winds up in New York City where he is taken in (in more ways than one) by a man named Wizard (Robin Williams, channeling Fagin)
4. He discovers a previously dormant musical talent, and impresses everyone
5. Fairytale ending will leave you asking or more

This movie is actually a modern day fairy tale, with an incredibly talented cast and a fantastic soundtrack.  In fact, it is the music that makes it so special, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  This is one to own and watch over and over again.

This movie reminded me of Save the Last Dance even though they have very little in common on the surface.  There's that struggle and search for meaning, and artists finding happiness in the end.  I love to watch movies about gifted musicians and dancers living out their dream.

If you're looking for a movie with some good clean entertainment, this is your movie.  Keri Russell is one of my favorites.  I loved her in Felicity, so maybe I'm a little biased where she's concerned.",1229126400,,630,4.580357142857143
3115476,4,B0013K7ZUE,"""August Rush"" is a ""magic movie"".  It's a movie about the power of love and music, which ultimately seem much more powerful in this film than they are in real life.
The story is about Evan Taylor, a boy who lives in a home for children without parents.  Evan knows that his parents are out in the world, though, and he desires to find them, through the power of music, which he says they ""gave to him"".  And indeed, this music is very powerful as he sets out on a journey to find his parents--just two people--in New York City.
If I told anymore, I would give a lot of the story away.  So I'll just say, this movie is a feel-good film.  Practical thinkers probably won't enjoy it as much, since there isn't much practicality in it.  It's a Hollywood movie to the core--true, deep love is portrayed as a one night stand, and events take place that would never happen in the real world.  But that's what movies--and music--is for, right?  To transport viewers and listeners to a different world.  And if so, ""August Rush"" does a pretty good job of it.

(I also like to add in a bit about content in the films I review.  As a 16-year-old Christian girl, I always appreciate reviews that shed some light on the objectionable content in a film.  So below is a summary of things parents might want to take into consideration.)

Love between two people in this film is portrayed as one night together on a rooftop of New York under the stars.  You never actually see anything, but you know they did more than kiss because the girl is pregnant later on.  All you see are the two of them lying on a couch on the roof in each other's arms.

A few d-words are spoken, mostly by a little boy.  God's name is used in vain a few times.  If you watch the deleted scenes, there is one that shows a character yelling out God's name and the d-word at a little kid.

The character played by Robin Williams is a little threatening at times.  While he ""cares"" for the street kids, his character doesn't really come across as caring.  Instead, he seems like a greedy, abusive sort of man.  You wonder if it was supposed to be implied that he was on drugs.  Either that, or the dude was just kinda doodly in the head.",1228176000,,2194,4.297560975609756

Although this story is of different background thna I relate to previously, it is truly a heartwarming and lovely movie of courage and love.",1228176000,,393,4.628571428571429
3115478,5,B0013K7ZUE,This is a great urban type of fairytale story . The music really sets this tale apart from others like it. Really worth watching,1228089600,,128,4.375
3115479,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Have you ever stopped and listened to the sounds all around you?  Did you hear the crickets, the wind chimes, the sounds of the wind?  They create music, a symphony when all is put together.  It is so beautiful and majestic.  Even taking in the scenery that paints pictures before you, can add to the wonders of the natural sounds.  August Rush (2007) is the perfect movie to turn your attention to these everyday surroundings.  Not only is it a movie of music and the power it holds, but it is also a movie of love, whether it be romantic love, friendly love, or the love of a family.  August Rush has it.  Its story line is unique, and is harmoniously constructed.
 I give a great deal of credit to the writers, James V. Hart (screenplay), Nick Castle (screenplay and story), and Paul Castro (story).  I applaud the producers, the crew behind the movie, and the director, Kirsten Sheridan.  There were many camera angles used; most were close-ups, but some long shots were included.  There was a scene at the beginning of the film where both of these types of shots were shown.  Lyla Novacek, (Keri Russell), and Louis Connelly, (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), just met on the rooftop of a building, and the close-ups of their faces showed sparkles in their eyes, they both looked happy and free.  In this same scene, a long shot showed a man walking, later to be revealed as Wizard, (Robin Williams), on the sidewalk beneath them playing a harmonica.  The camera was zoomed out and in when necessary, and used in so many different angles.  At one point the camera zoomed out rapidly from a close-up on Russell, when she thought she saw her son.  The watcher could really get a feel for the characters throughout the movie.
 It was great to see the way the music carried emotions, the lighting formed a scene or character, and the shots told the viewer what to think and feel about what was being shot.  The different sets, especially the broken down theater, proved that the props and sets were well thought about.  The costumes were mainly modern day, and the accents of the actors fit who they were described to be.  For example, Louis was an Irish character, and that's just the accent he carried.  Symbolism came with the moon and music, which was the connection between Evan Taylor, (Freddie Highmore), Lyla, and Louis.  Wizard said a quote in the movie that revealed the role symbolism played in this particular film.  He said, ""Music is...God's little reminder there's something else besides us in this universe.  Harmonic connection between all living beings everywhere, even the stars.""  The setting took place in numerous cities.  They were, San Francisco, Chicago, and a few different cities in New York, all mentioned in the movie at least once.
 The movie started out with capturing the viewer as, Evan Taylor/August Rush, spoke while only a black screen showed.  He was an orphan who believed the music talked to him.  He even ran away from the orphanage because ""the music told him to.""  He was on the search of his parents, listening to the music to find his way.  Along the way, he met a boy named Arthur X, (Leon G. Thomas III), who introduced Evan to Wizard.  After discovering the musical prodigy that Evan was, and fearing that he would be taken away, Wizard gave Evan Taylor the name of August Rush.  August continued his journey with the help of other characters throughout the film. As he searched for Lyla, his mother, she, soon after, began the search for him, and Louis, his father, began the search for her.  The movie shows these three different lives and how they are intertwined.  Richard Jeffries, (Terrance Howard), winds up playing a big part in the paths of these characters.  August's life and search was the main focus though.  His search revealed yet another symbol, a necklace, which symbolized that he was on the right track in his journey.
  This original script will fill you with emotion, questions, and even wonder.  Lie back, and let the music take you away in this hope filled, love story.  Discover how a necklace showed that August was on the right track.  Embrace new levels of imagination as music brings magic to the film and opens you up to ideas you never thought possible.  Answer your own questions: Are Lyla, Louis, and August ever connected together?  Does the music bring them to the end of their search on a high note?  Follow the music and find out for yourself in August Rush.",1228003200,,4432,4.675291073738681
3115480,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Beautiful story in every way!  So what if it was completely improbable.  Maybe we could just look at this as a fantasy and sit back and enjoy the story and incredible music that comes along with the package.

3115482,3,B0013K7ZUE,"I wish Freddie Highmore was a better actor, otherwise I could have really fallen for this picture in a big way, but perforce the screenplay had to keep returning from more interesting byways to focus on August's plight, and my heart sank each time.  Funny thing too, for I used to like seeing Freddie in his other films: maybe he just isn't up to this particular part, for all he does here is widen his eyes with inexpressible delight every time he hears *music,* and then, as if that wasn't enough, those eyes widen further every time he hears mere *sound.*  Nick Castle, the screenwriter, is always bad with kids: he is the madman responsible for HOOK and also he directed the horrid movie version of DENNIS THE MENACE and should have been exiled to Neptune for those crimes.  And sorry, little Freddie just doesn't look like he could possibly be the son of Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.

Speaking of which, for me the picture lost dramatic plausibility the minute rich girl Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) lays eyes on emo musician Louis Connelly (Rhys Meyers) in the shadow of Washington Square Arch.  He invites her to climb up and sit by him.  Sorry, if he were the last man on earth you wouldn't catch me sitting on a high parapet next to Jonathan Rhys Meyers, I'd be too afraid he'd just tip me over the side of the building.  ANY stranger, but especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  There's something sinister and creepy about him, though maybe Lyla's drawn to him because of a similar streak in her own father (Bill Sadler, the sheriff from ROSWELL), who has a strange fixation on her that leads to terrible consequences.

I kept thinking there must have been scenes deleted from the movie, scenes covering the character arc of little Arthur (Leon Thomas III), whom we first see as the prize prodigy of crazy Wizard (Robin Williams), busking in Washington Square Park like a tiny rock star.  As the film progresses, it's rather like ALL ABOUT EVE, with Evan Taylor/August Rush gradually supplanting poor Arthur in Wizard's affections, and becoming super famous and desired, while Arthur just stands there looking glum.  Does he resent the white boy's success?  Is it a parable for American race relations--August even gets to keep the very guitar Arthur once played?  I think so, but it's almost as if they wanted to keep this aspect of the film muted--and in general, black children AND adults are nothing but helpful and kind to the lad of mysterious origins, August Rush, even saving his life on more than one occasion.  This must be why poor Terrence Howard (whom I hope they paid a huge sum to) gets to appear in the film as the helpful, kind social worker.  When you see him, your heart swells with sympathy, feeling sorry for the man who was once going to be the next big thing in the movies, and now he's playing a distant second or third fiddle to Freddie Highmore, sob.",1227139200,,2889,4.659448818897638

3115486,3,B0013K7ZUE,"""August Rush"" is the kind of film that everyone says you HAVE to watch, as it will 'change your life'. Despite being a fairly new release, it has achieved some sort of cult status on the home video circuit, and I predict that in a few years it will be up there with 'Field of Dreams' as a constant seller on DVD.

That said, I am not one for sappy mediocrity and obvious sentimentality, and this movie has loads of it. From the opening five minutes to the absolutely useless climax (yes, I know it worked for many viewers, but I thought it ruined the film), every scene is worked in such a way that you can't help but see the end coming from a mile away.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a fine looking human being, but he looked awkwardly out of place and insensitive in his role here, played out with obviously no passion. Far better is Keri Russell who plays the female lead - this is one actress who has so far been underutilized in general, and here she is no different. Freddie Highmore takes all the credit in his breakthrough performance here - its a finely nuanced performance by a young actor we should see more of.

On the surface, ""August Rush"" is the sad tale of a child who believes his birth parents are out there somewhere. Both his birth parents are musicians, and the child inherits their musical genius. The final scene is a spectacle, where the young boy 'brings together' his parents under a brilliant night sky, all while conducting a symphony. Its glorious, beautiful, etc, but somehow it still did not move me. I guess the really bad performances by Meyers and Russell during the last five minutes really capsized the film, which is a pity. The last scene, which SHOULD be really powerful, just comes and goes.

In the right hands, ""August Rush"" could have been an epic classic that could stand the test of time, and become a movie masterpiece. The way it is right now, its a sentimental middle-of-the-road film that could have been so, so much more.

The DVD has NO REAL extras... Added scenes are really it for additional content you may appreciate. (I don't count ""Scene Selection"" and ""Language Options"" as DVD Extras...) The DVD (not the movie) is why I gave this product 4 stars...

With that said... Here is the good.

There are 147 5 star ratings for this movie... and this movie is worth more IMHO. Here is my experience with this film.

Over a 2 week period:

My wife and I caught half of this on our Tivo.

Then we recorded it and watched two more times (on our Tivo).

Then we went and bought the DVD and watched it AGAIN, and each time we were reduced to blubbering tears of happiness... (Her not me... well I was a little choked up... but not as much as her.)

So the good in this movie demonstrates much of what is missing in our world today...

Faith, that things will be OK even when things look bleak.

Commitment, even when circumstances get in the way of being dedicated to an idea, dream, or a special person.

Serendipity, when many in our world feel like nothing good will happen to them. (Though they secretly hope it will.)

And Patience... something most of us just don't ever get to see on a daily basis...

August Rush is not just a story about a boy prodigy who tries to reconnect to his parents through a shared gift of music.  No, this is a story that teaches a lesson about being true to yourself and listening to those strong feelings that we all have from within.

Of course we are all not blessed with the musical genius that ""August"" possessed, but we do all have something from within that we can and should be passionate about, something we should have absolute and unwavering belief in.  We just need to listen to that inner voice and pursue that dream rather than following the masses because it is the ""right"" thing to do.

I thought the actors were well cast and for the most part were believable.  The story itself left me shaking my head a couple of times but that is okay- I still enjoyed it and the music was great.

While I enjoyed it overall, I would have liked it better if they focused more on this boy's musical talents as he was growing up, instead it starts after he is already a preteen, and the Movie focuses more on building to the climax of his musical talent bringing his lost parents together which was the end of the movie.  The best parts of the movie total about 15-20 minutes, and the rest of it seems like nothing more than filler.  This movie could have been so much better if the focus was more about the life and behavior of a growing child musical prodigy, rather than what is offered.  The ending alone, does make the movie worth watching, and it was the only part that got me involved emotionally.  I rate it four stars for the ending, the rest of it I would rate two stars.

3115495,2,B0013K7ZUE,"Well, August Rush wasn't terrible, but it just didn't do the job for this viewer. The movie tells the story of Evan (Freddie Highmore), a young orphan in a boy's home somewhere in New York state. Evan insists that he can hear music everywhere, that he knows his parents want him and will find him, that he doesn't want to be placed with a new family because he's already GOT a family.

Rewind 11 years to meet Lyla (Kerri Russell), a famed cellist, with a controlling father and an engagement to play with the New York Philharmonic. After her big performance, she meets Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the lead singer in a band, at a party. The two instantly click and share a passionate night together. However, the next day, Lyla's father forbids her from seeing Louis again and ships her off . . . somewhere.

Lyla later discovers she's pregnant due to her encounter with Louis, but cannot find him. A car accident late in her pregnancy lands her in the hospital. While Lyla is still unconscious, her father gives her baby up for adoption. When she comes to, he tells her the baby died as a result of the accident. The baby, of course, is Evan.

Back to the present - Determined to find his parents, Evan runs away from the orphanage. ""Following the music"" lands him in New York City, where he meets all sorts of unsavory characters, discovers his own musical talents, and searches for the missing pieces of his family.

While I think the initial concept of this movie was a decent one, it suffered in the execution. Too many plotpoints were thin or didn't make sense. Too many things seemed sooooo improbable that it kept me from fully engaging in the world of the movie. And it was so sugary sweet that I almost got a toothache.

All performances were pretty solid (though one does wonder why Louis' Irish brogue hasn't softened at least a little after living in the U.S. for 10+ years). I fully believe that, with a better script, this could have been a great movie.

3115500,2,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is set around the feel-good magic of mystical musical bonds that occur between 3 of the 4 main characters of the movie; a family physically separated but spiritually aware of one-another. Their link is pure wondrous fantasy and there's nothing wrong with that, but then we are presented with the mechanism with which the 3 will be united -- it is there that I find a huge difficulty in liking this movie.

I love music as a listener and performer and have always felt that it has a magical quality to it. But a good fantasy (for me) always takes an element of magic, such as the mystical musical bond between Lyla and her son and her one-night-stand lover, and presents its protagonist with some sort of challenge to perfect the magic.

Yet no fantasy challenge arises. Lyla's son, Evan, is simply magical, except when he's not, who's to tell? His instant, and I do mean instant guitar and pipe organ playing skills and musical notation skills were pure fantasy without effort. Evan, aka August Rush picks up a guitar for the first time and with no fine motor skills training channels the ghost of Michael Hedges (check him out if you liked Evan's style of guitar playing; frankly, I was offended by the artistic rip-off as the physically demanding and technically challenging techniques that Evan just pulls out thin air were invented by the late Mr. Hedges). He is befriended by a kindly reverend and a young girl, a refugee in the church, and immediately learns how to read and score music with no tutelage. There were opportunities to spend a few movie minutes here and there to make Evan's transformation from a non-musician to a guitar playing god more believable, but the director went for a lazy  prefab genius/magic boy route more often then not. Even when Evan/August winds up a musical ""student"" at his mother's alma-mater, Julliard, he is shown to be teaching the teachers almost from the get-go; no strain to perfect his magical musical ability.

But there is something, nay, somebody in Evan's way, somebody preventing him from uniting with his mystically gathering family. That somebody is a money-grubbing, lost-soul ex-musician, played by Robin Williams. This promising character could have added much more to the story. How did he lose his soul, could he get it back? Did he have a mystical tie to Evan's parents other than mere happenstance? In what way was his nickname, the Wizard, warranted? We'll never know, the character is instead used as a throw away impediment to Evan's quest to find family. And is about as menacing as a junk yard dog on a leash when he's not being a sympathetic character. In short, the ""wizard's"" story is a tepid voyage to nowhere.

So August Rush veers between reality and pure fantasy, with neither faction presented with any sort of conviction -- no hint of real struggle or conquest or even surprise as Evan is united with his mother and father at the end.

I find it interesting that there are so many high ratings for this movie, while at the same time reviewers frequently acknowledge that this movie is full holes (Those mentioned above are by no means an exhaustive list). Is this the price of a nice feel-good movie; to be sold on the idea that intellect and emotion are entirely at odds? If there's anything we should have learned by now from Disney/Pixar, it's that you don't have to overly dumb-down stories to your children to get them to appreciate fantasy and happiness; and adults shouldn't have to dumb-down their expectations for movies that appeal to all.

Great heart-warming spiritual premise merits two and a half stars, but the vision is sorely muddled by the half-baked efforts of the writers and director.",1222041600,,3693,4.778996865203761

Yes, there are a lot of incidents that could be viewed as ""unrealistic"" such as Freddie suddenly being able to write in musical notation after a 1-minute lesson from a little girl.  For me, I let these go as telescoping a time sequence.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Louis who has a charged one-night-stand with Keri Russell's character Lyla which results in the orphan scenario.

Since both Lyla & Louis are musicians, it follows that August's superb musical talent flowed from and connects him to his parents.  Terrence Howard has a subtle role as the social worker Richard Jeffries who seems behind the curve in helping the boy.

He makes the small role shine.  William Sadler from the ""Roswell"" TV show plays Lyla's dad Thomas Novacek.  He is really the heavy in the film with forging Lyla's name on an important document.  Robin Williams who earned his Oscar for ""Good Will Hunting"" has a difficult task as Wizard.  On one hand, we see his inspiration in music.  On the other, he's very greedy.  We want him to be nicer.  Marian Seldes has a nice cameo as the Dean of Julliard.  I found the film enthralling.

In fact, it's so warm and fuzzy (read: unrealistic) that you scream at the cynical voice within to shut-up! ""August Rush"" is such a movie. Watched this on DVD late last night and loved every single frame of the movie. It's so good that if I could lick the movie, I would.

Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is a musical prodigy who grows up in an orphanage believing that his parents are still alive. So he sets out on a quest to create music that will draw his parents to him. Along the way, he gets picked up by the ""Wizard"" (Robin Williams) who wants to exploit his musical talents for money. His parents are actually the famous concert cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish guitarist and lead singer from a rock band. He's the result of a ""one-night-stand"" 11 years ago. Lyla's father lied to her that the baby had died when in truth, he sent him to an orphanage.

The entire movie feels so unreal that it's almost like a song, a concerto. It celebrates music as the ultimate wordless communication between us. It celebrates the harmony of the universe, the music of the spheres, the sounds of the winds and the rhythms of our heartbeats. Granted, it's not for everyone - certainly not for the cynic at heart.

3115507,2,B0013K7ZUE,"I'd have enjoyed this movie more if... well, if it had been better! I was expecting a serious movie and was dealt a Dickensian (1/2 of this story is Oliver Twist), Hollywood fairy-tale where actors are merely props for the movie's symbolism: Keri Russell is sublime and disciplined classical music and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is hip and emotional Rock and Roll. A short-lived fling gives birth to Freddie Highmore, a super-gifted, musically inclined child who integrates both of his parents' artistic temperaments. They move through life longing for one another, both parents unaware of their boy's existence. Robin Williams plays an interesting character, the only complex one in the movie, who comes into Highmore's life during his time of need, gives him a name but whose relationship must eventually be abandoned. Williams' character also represents, to me, the stages of a career in music which in the end goes bad: Inspired and driven by love of the art initially, which then turns materialistic and self-destructive.

The original aspects could have, if they had been done correctly by writer/director Kirsten Sheridan, been interesting, yet from the writing board to the final product much was lost. What is beyond reproach are her sets and shots; she has the ability to create in her movies a world one wants to live in. I absolutly love her use of colors and light. Yet, using actors as chess pieces to tell a story is just bad film-making, I'd have expected better from her.

The problem is that once a writer or director decides to make symbols out of characters, the actor is trapped into playing the same note (and isn't that ironic?). That premise leads the movie to make several unbelievably stupid choices: After Rhys-Meyers abandons his super-hip band in New York (there was talk about ""going back to Ireland"") he finds an unlikely, super-cushy job in California. This type of overtly-privileged fantasy life is fine for the OC or 90210, not for a movie that wants to be deep. I can -grudgingly- let that go but when he runs into a former band mate years later we find that although the band broke up after he left, somehow they ALL end up living in California and within driving distance of each other! This is just insulting your audience. Beyond that, August Rush is just enervatingly sentimental; I haven't rolled my eyes at a movie so much since the English Patient.

This movie has heart, is beautifully shot, family friendly and even something you might enjoy if you are in the right mood. It is about a universe of sounds and how harmony brings us together, about integrating all the notes in our scale and the value of art, discipline, emotion and Love. Too bad there's a droning single note throughout the movie and an excessive amount of emotional sap that makes August Rush easy to be cynical about.",1219017600,,2826,4.846790890269151
3115508,2,B0013K7ZUE,"All I can say after seeing this highly recommended movie is...Puhleeze!!! Nearly every movie has some unrealistic ""hollywood"" aspects to it that stretch believability, but I have never seen anything that quite compares to August Rush in this way. Keri Russell is not very believable as a renowned concert cellist in the first place. On top of that, when she is playing a concert at the beginning and end of the film, she somehow knows that her true love, Jonathan Rhys-meyers, is playing a rock concert somewhere at the same time, and he knows that she is playing a concert at the same time, and their music is perfectly in sync, and somehow at the end of the film she knows that her son can hear her playing through a subway grate, and somehow the boy ends up running away from the evil Robin Williams just in time to make it to the concert to squeeze into a tux and direct the Juilliard orchestra playing his composition, and somehow he knows that his mom and dad are in the audience standing down in the first row... you get the idea. Everyone in the film must be clairvoyant I guess. This is pure sentimental pap.",1218153600,,1117,4.480392156862745

3115510,3,B0013K7ZUE,"I've seen great movies without a fraction of the potential storyline of this one. The idea for this movie was great!  Unfortunately, this movie wasn't. In almost every aspect of the movie, I feel the final product fell way short.  The story was developed very poorly, probably made worse by poor direction and bad editing. All I know is I didn't believe any of it. I didn't understand the notoriety surrounding the mother musician; her character was never developed so one could believe in her ability. They added to the disbelief by the few times they showed Keri Russell ""playing"" the cello; she didn't fake it very well... they could have done that better.  And I can think of a dozen of actors that have more musical ability and presence than Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He can't play, he can't sing, and the song they chose for him to ""write"" sucked. The actors conveyed no passion for their music or the feeling that music was really a part of them; Although I tried, I could never fool myself to believe they were musicians.  August (Freddie Highmore) was more convincing, but even he was way too deadpan and passionless (except occasionally when he was playing). Robin Williams had more passion and feeling than everyone else in the movie put together, but even his character seemed fragmented and untrue.  The story was developed poorly from beginning to end. This is so disappointing considering the potential this story had. The idea of music being all around us and in everything is powerful and compelling, and the idea of a prodigy like August developing and becoming public is thrilling. But this movie didn't convey these ideas well at all and was about the least powerful and compelling or thrilling movie I've seen in awhile.  This movie had no ring of truth to it at all.  The final production seemed rushed, superficial, disjointed, unconvincing and amateurish.  Although the movie was O.K., I was very disappointed.",1217548800,,1930,4.844984802431611

Aside from the great soundtrack, the juxtaposing of classical cello and electric guitar, and the riffs Evan/August creates on his guitar, there is also the poignant searching of Evan for his parents, and later his mother for him, and his father for his mother.  The three souls are joined and connected through music.  This is definitely a movie that you can watch over and over again, because of the freshness of the music, and rooting for the orphan to find his parents despite his circumstances.",1217376000,,765,4.765151515151516

This movie is the best depiction of a life being led by the Spirit of God that resides in all of us. A life pregnant with giftedness, purpose, and brilliance, as I believe all of our lives are. This movie beautifully depicts what can happen when you cut through fear, doubt, sadness, feelings of abandonment or unworthiness or whatever negative cloud that tends to hover over our lives as humans,  If we can defeat those spiritual enemies and approach life with the faith and innocence of a child as Jesus suggested, allowing ourselves to be guided by the truth and wisdom that God placed in us upon our conception and embrace our divine giftedness, we would all see miraculous and unimaginable things happen in our lives! This movie showed the mother, father and child listening to and following their intuition (which I believe is the voice of God)and allowing themselves to be led to the life God desired for them.  If anyone is low on faith, or has trouble understanding what being in relationship to The Father actually looks like, THERE IS NO OTHER MOVIE FOR YOU! and those, (like me) who periodically need to be reminded of the glorious and awesome nature of God's love-- this movie is one for the collection.",1217376000,,1336,4.705128205128205
3115514,4,B0013K7ZUE,"I have to admit, I stayed away from AUGUST RUSH due to the commercials and the negative reviews that appeared in my local newspapers and on some local television shows. It looked like it would be a bit too syrupy and critics warned it was too far fetched. I decided to save the money and wait for the DVD. After seeing the DVD, I'm sorry I waited so long to see this film. It's enchanting and heart warming and an all around feel good flick.

The story focuses on Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore), a young boy growing up in a New York home for children. His conception is the result of a romantic evening involving a classically trained musician  Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connolly, an Irish born member of  Celtic musical group (Jonathan Rhys Myers). Due to tragic and cruel circumstances, the young Evan is placed up for adoption but never seems to find a family. After being bullied at the home, Evan sets out to find his parents, believing that the music will guide him and the most of the film revolves around his journey.

Critics are correct in stating that the story is far fetched, and there are quite a few gaps and questions that remain unanswered, but this is the case with many movies, and we still love them, the reason being the actors make the film convincing and we tend to ignore the flaws. The reason AUGUST RUSH works is due to the wonderful performances of the actors, particularly the young Freddie Highmore. His performance is so appealing, we hope for the bets for the young man, knowing all the while that the film will have a happy ending. We also feel for Keri Russell's Lyla and Rhys Meyer's Louis Connolly is an all around good guy as well. Robin Williams' character ""Wizard"" is a bit creepy and a bit too one dimensional, to Williams' credit he does do his bets to bring the character to life. Another notable performer in the film is Leon Thomas III who plays Arthur, a gifted child performer living on the street who rescues the young Evan while unknowingly placing him in danger.

In many ways, AUGUST RUSH has a number of similarities to OLIVER TWIST (the novel more so than the musical film OLIVER!), Evan being similar to the innocent Oliver Twist, Wizard being similar to Fagin ,an d Arthur, a street child similar to The Artful Dodger, and some of the challenges the young Evan faces are Dickensian-like. Yet just as readers root for Oliver and want the best for him, the same holds true for the young Evan. We watch the film, hope for the best, and cheer for him all the way.",1217116800,,2524,4.502183406113537
3115515,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This movie is shockingly wonderful. So much belief in one child and the courage to stand out. This movie will make you cry, laugh, and think more about the life you live. It's at the top of my list.

3115517,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Evan Taylor is an orphan who knows his parents are out there looking for him. He hears music in everything. He is convinced that if he can play music, his parents will find him.

Evan's father, an Irish musician met Evan's mother, a cello player in a chance encounter. His mother, Lyla is told that her baby has died. His father, Louis was unaware that there ever was a child. Louis and Lyla long for each other. They both give up their music and can't find true happiness.

Evan runs away from the orphanage, saying he is following the music. He goes home with a street musician about his age, who plays for donations. Evan finds himself in a run down theatre, living with many other runaways. The leader, a man called the Wizard, discovers Evans talents, and gives him the choice spot as a street performer. He also names him August Rush, which sounds more like a performer's name.

August Rush follows the music he hears and walks into a church with a choir practicing. Evan can play the piano on his first try. His music leads him to perform his own symphany, in Central Park. August Rush is sure that if his music can be presented to a larger audience he will find his parents.

This is a sweet and happy film. The music is delightful. You will find yourself anxiously hoping for Evan to find his parents. You will also long for Lyla and Louis, who have both turned back to their music after eleven years, to find each other again.

I highly recommend this movie for children and adults. I have seen it two times and hope to watch it again. There are very few movies I will watch twice.

3115518,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This has to be one of the best movies I've seen that ties the connection that music makes to human emotion. Not only is the music inspired, but the performers are especially convincing. Jonathon Rhys Meyers has an amazing voice, Keri Russell, while not really 'playing' the cello has obviously studied well for this role, as her handing of the instrument and the body language she projects are passionate and convincing. Then there's Freddie Highmore, clearly the star of the movie. How does a kid of his age access such depth within himself to play a child prodigy with so much conviction and enthusiasm? Beats me, but he was a joy to watch in every scene.

The added bonus here, and for me the thing that catapults this movie to greatness, is the spiritual connections made throughout. They are made in several subtle ways, but those who are especially attuned to that sort of thing will find plenty of inspiration.",1216598400,,917,4.73125

Not surprisingly his mother is a concert cellist and his father is a singer and guitar player.  When Evan runs away from the orphanage, he is taken under the wing of a street hustler (Robin Williams) who gives him a guitar and begins his musical career.

3115523,5,B0013K7ZUE,"'August Rush' is, as best, hard to describe. It's not a musical, but it's a movie about music, where music forms the emotional backbone of the story. It's not a fantasy, but the story it tells has elements that can only be described as fantastic. It's not a 'family film' is the traditional sense, though it is a movie the the whole family can watch, enjoy, and appreciate on many levels.

'August Rush' tells the story of a young boy, conceived on a magical night between a pair of star-crossed lovers who seem to be fated never to meet again, and given up as an orphan at birth. Despite his hard life, the boy has a faith that is challenged at every turn. It is not a faith in a God or gods, not even a faith that his parents will find hom someday. What this boy believes in more than anything is a force that shapes his life and the story he tells us: he believes in music.

The boy's faith leads him to a story which is nothing less than magical. It leads him to New York, to discover his own talent for music, to new friends, to people who would use what he brings for their own ends, to those who actually care for him.  His belief and his ability and his determination lead him to hear the music all around him, and to express it in his own way.

'August Rush' tells a story that isn't heard very often today, a story of hope and belief and music and the simple ways that magic can be a part of our lives. Like any good fairy tale, 'August Rush' cracks open a door to simple magic and wonder, and invites us to walk through.

""All you have to do...is listen.""",1215302400,,1566,4.1551155115511555
3115524,5,B0013K7ZUE,"It's easy to point out the incongruities of Kirsten Sheridan's magical ""August Rush""...an 11-year-old who learns guitar in one night, and piano and musical composition in another...but this is not a movie for nitpickers, but for dreamers, and all of us who hear music in everything we experience. And boy, does this film deliver!

I wasn't surprised to see Nick Castle's hand in the screenplay, as he is an old hand at finding magic in our cynical world (he wrote and directed ""The Boy Who Could Fly""); here, we have the story of two incredibly gifted musicians, a Julliard-trained cellist (Keri Russell), and a self-taught Irish rock singer/composer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who bond under the stars in New York City, then are torn apart by families with their own agendas. She carries his child, but after an accident, her ambitious father (William Sadler) steals the newborn, dumps the baby into social services, and announces to the daughter that the child had died. What is MEANT to be, never happens, the lives of both musicians unravel, and they soon give up their gifts, for mundane careers...as their unknown child (the remarkable Freddie Highmore) grows into a musical prodigy, on a mission to find them.

The bulk of the film deals with the child's search, and the remarkable people he meets along the way, from a sympathetic welfare worker (Terrence Howard), to a gifted child guitarist and his Fagin-like mentor (Leon Thomas III and Robin Williams, who is creepy, but excellent), and finally, a powerful child gospel singer, and her pastor (Jamia Simone Nash and Mykelti Williamson). Dubbed 'August Rush' by Williams, the boy harnesses his prodigious musical talents, even as his parents individually renew their own musical careers, and are drawn back to New York City, and a tear-inducing, spectacular climax. Predictable? You bet, but I dare you not to be moved, anyway!

The performances are first-rate, particularly from the child actors, and the music is awesome. This is unabashedly a 'feel-good' movie, the perfect flick to pop into the DVD player when you're feeling down.

My only real quibble is the lack of Special Features; extended scenes are all that are offered, and this is a film I'd have loved learning more about...

""August Rush"" is a wonderful film that shouldn't be missed!",1215302400,,2308,5.015665796344647

I had to let my ""inner child"" take over at the contrived ending which was totally unbelievable but, who cares?  Watching it made you feel terrific - just turn your intellect off for a few minutes.  I would give this movie 5 stars for the entire movie, save the conclusion which was unbelievable but still moving.  I rented it on demand and will buy to add to my collection of other ""feel good"" movies.  This is one to keep and great for the entire family.  I think children would really enjoy it as well.  I felt it conveyed the way we musicians feel and ""hear"" music - or unfortunately for many people - who don't.  Studies have shown that our brains are ""hard wired"" for music appreciation and this film certainly shows that beautifully.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who has ever loved a piece of music and wants an escape from our daily drudge even if you must suspend belief.  As an opera lover, I do that all the time!

3115528,5,B0013K7ZUE,"A young boy (Freddie Highmore) growing up in an orphanage dreams of being found by his parents and survives by his innate gift for and love of music. When he runs away to New York to find them, he takes up with a group of kid street musicians led by the sometimes nurturing, sometimes dangerous, and always exploitative Wizard (Robin Williams). Under Wizard's guidance, the boy takes on the name August Rush, and while in New York he hones his skills at a genius's pace in the hopes that his long lost parents will follow the music to find him. Meanwhile, only just discovering that her son did not die at birth, August's mother (Keri Russell) is already on the search with the help of a caring social worker (Terence Howard), while August's father (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is seeking to find her, the lost love he has never forgotten.

When I first saw trailers for ""August Rush"", I had no idea that it was based on ""Oliver Twist"", something that quickly became obvious when watching it. However, I also underestimated how touching it would be, and that's even though I expected it to be very good from the get-go. Regardless of the fact that its story is predictable (if you know Oliver Twist at all) and slightly sappy (not as sappy as I was afraid it might be, though), this is one heck of a movie! It'll bring you to tears a lot. In fact, it'll send you up and down throughout as you root for August and his family to finally come together. But what makes this one so different than just being a modern-day Oliver Twist is the fact that August Rush is a musical prodigy, and this is well woven into the story and a huge part of it. It's significant enough to make the film as much about the love and magic of music as it is about modernizing a classic. So, don't be put off by the fact that the tale is an old one. The brilliant cast, music, and engaging story will soon have you forgetting that you're on a journey you've been through before.

The DVD is double-sided for widescreen and fullscreen and comes with a selection of deleted scenes as the only bonus features. Definitely a must-see, and for many, a must-own.",1214870400,,2123,4.441025641025641
3115529,4,B0013K7ZUE,"The first half hour of this movie is ridiculously slow.  I must admit that the first time I saw this movie, I was very bored at first.  And, the love story clich is nothing original.  ""Oh noes, my rockstar boyfriend is gone!!""  Seen it all before.

But, honestly, I got something much different out of this movie than most people seem to have gotten.  While other people seem to be focused on the love story, or that August is a musical prodigy, or that he is bound and determined to find his parents, or what have you, all of that seemed secondary to me.  To me, the real story is how music affects us all, no matter who we are or what kind of music we make.  August's dad is a guitarist and a rock singer who quits his music only to return later, because his life is incomplete without it.  His mother is a classically trained cellist who becomes a music teacher as well as a performer.  Wizard turns to music as a means to an end (teaching the children to play so they can make money for him) and as a source of comfort (playing the harmonica when he loses his best student).  All of the professors at Julliard are moved by the music that August creates.  Is music not the real star of this movie?  Freddie Highmore's character is just a facilitator.  Music the true star here.  Thus, I give this movie 4 stars.",1214697600,,1314,4.2631578947368425

3115532,4,B0013K7ZUE,"I rented this film first, watched it, adored the musicality of it, and then promptly ordered it (so much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores). Yes, it is a modern ""adaptation"" of OLIVER TWIST. Yes, Robin Williams' character of Wizard is creepy beyond belief (for a better dark portrayal, check out his anarchist character on a late episode of Law & Order: SVU from this past season-it ran in April/May). Yes, the characters of Lyla and Louis don't age in 10 years (how old are they supposed to be when they meet? 18, 20? Who knows?). I say all of these things to state that although we KNOW these things are highly unlikely to happen, that doesn't take away from the message of the film.

I enjoyed the sweeping view of NYC and it's outlying suburbs, all of the kid's inherent musical genius, and the universal THEME of wanting to belong to someone or something (in August/Evan's case, his family).

I knocked off 1 star because I thought Keri Russell could've shined a bit more and shown more range as Lyla Novacek. Also, I didn't see a need for Terrence Howard's social worker. Anyone could've played that part ably (perhaps I'm biased, but I haven't liked anything Howard's done since ""The Best Man""). Jonathan Rhys Meyers was a revelation as Louis Connelly though. What a talent (singing and acting)! The look that he gives August/Evan in the park after playing ""Dueling Guitars"" is so fraught with emotion-he knows this kid is special; he just can't put his finger on WHY.

The ending could've been extended a bit, and the DVD is short on special features (nothing at ALL about how the music came together for the film-what a shame since it's such an integral part of the movie). Overall I give it a 4-star effort. A great family film.",1214265600,,1741,4.609677419354838

Sure the story line was a bit hokey, and the little boy's playing of the guitar was not for real, but the music was just plain fantastic.  Sent chills up and down my spine the first time he picked up that guitar.

Far too often, movies are pure trash, full of sex, nudity, virtual intercourse, blood, violence, pure filthy language, denigration of various ethnic groups, genders, etc., obviously thrown together for the sole purpose of making a quick buck.

3115539,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I enjoyed this movie due to the fact I've worked with many foster care children in the past. The feelings this kid faces in the movie are faced by many children on a daily basis in our country: Why did they leave me?, Did my parents want me?, Will I ever find them?, If I move to a family or to another home will they find me if they look for me?... etc. Having a fantasy belief that their real parents will come back is one reason why many children resist adoption and try disrupting placements. What's sad is that the majority of the time that fantasy never comes true... and the kid is left alone and unloved.

The blu-ray version of August Rush is definitely worth the investment especially if you have a good sound system.

I usually watch suspense and intrigue types of movies and an occasional comedy as there aren't that many other types of movies that will hold my attention.

It's basically a twisted musical version of Oliver Twist. It's one of the strangest musical movies ever! something I care nothing about. It was infuriating how the boy kept missing his parents by just a little. Also, NOT RECCOMENDED FOR SMALLER CHILDREN, his ""parents"" got him doing something well, um,.........sexual. Half the movie was flash-backs and I do think they did them well, It's sooo easy to make flashbacks confusing.

3115555,1,B0013K7ZUE,"If you just open yourself to the music, you can pick up a guitar for the first time and within two minutes be an expert.  And within a few weeks, you will not only know the definition of the word rhapsody, you will be conducting an orchestra representing Julliard in Central Park to perform a rhapsody YOU wrote for thousands of awed listeners.  If you have a gift, it really requires absolutely no work.  You will just be good automatically.  You writing this down kids?  Make sure you tell this to your teachers when you tell them you haven't done your homework.  You are GIFTED...you don't need to do any work.
And you know what else?  If you are talented, good looking, cool, and perhaps have a little tortured soul thrown in, you can sit on a rooftop, meet a gorgeous female, tell her your name along with some ridiculously cheesy lines, and immediately have ""marital relations"" with her...and everything will turn out great in the end.
Great fun for the entire family!!!  Hooray!

So many disbelievable occurances happened in this farce of a film, but I think I should name one more.  Lyla's father signed away the baby, forging her name, which in itself is nearly impossible.  A doctor would have to witness her signing the papers.  But beyond that, does anyone realize how long the line is to adopt an infant in this country?  It's staggering.  So why was Evan still a ward of the state at 11 years of age?  Baloney...he would have been in the arms of a caring mother and father from day 1. Asking us to suspend our belief is one thing, but this film asked us to be idiots.

Oh, I must admit one of my shortcomings here. When Even (aka August)was fleeing from Wizard in the subway and his buddy, Arthur, yelled to him ""Run August Run"", I did not stand and immediately throw rotten food at the screen.  I really should have.

And if Freddy Highmore's agent is reading this....you should be fired for letting your client star in this joke of a film.  This film has ""career killer"" written all over it.  Kerri Russell is old enough to know better.  What was she thinking?",1211155200,,2076,4.497326203208556

3115565,4,B0013K7ZUE,"This was a great movie... that is, if you like movies that fall into your comfort zones.  And I do... sometimes.  To be honest, I'm generally more a fan of action, horror, teen comedy, etc.  So ""August Rush"" does not fit into my ideal of a good movie (and, for examples, I consider movies like The Dark Knight, Blade, Underworld, Oh Brother Where Art Thou, Friday the 13th, and American Pie great movies).  However, this movie was good as far as being a feel-good movie.  I have been stressed out, sick, and just generally sad over the past couple months, so this movie helped to lift my spirits quite a bit.

Admittedly, it is unrealistic and the plot depends wholly and completely on tons of deux et machinas.  Everything that happens just happens.  The father of the boy is never actually told that he is Evan's (August) father.  And until that concert in the park, the boy doesn't know that either of them are his parents, and yet he does know (what?).  The timeline of 11 years also does not help to make it realistic.

What this movie is trying to get across is that the boy is drawn by the music.  As a musician myself, I can relate to this sentiment.  It is true that music is out there, everywhere, and it controls those of us who listen.  The following line from Led Zeppelin's ""Houses of the Holy"" says it best:
""Let the music be your master.  Will you heed the master's call?""
That is the idea this movie tried to get across, and it's effort was good, if rushed and unbelievable.

Finally, I think this would have been much better as a novel.  At least, as a novel, there'd be much more room to explain much of what seemed like well-planned coincidences and serious and obvious deux et machinas.

So why do I give this movie 4 stars?  Because it is uplifting, helped me feel better, and it is a Comfort-Zone Bullseye.",1209945600,,1829,4.422155688622754
3115566,3,B0013K7ZUE,"I really struggled with the rating scale on this one, so I'll break it down a little this time.

Music: Outstanding.  Easily a 5/5.  Or maybe a 6/5.

Cast: Perfect.  5/5. Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers portray their characters quite nicely.  Freddie Highmore does an excellent job as ""August Rush"" but I have to say that Jamia Simone Nash stole the show with her larger than life voice (and the fact that she's just adorable). Robin Williams did a nice job in his role, however I didn't enjoy his character (see plot below).

Plot: 2/5. The one night stand on top of a building in the middle of the night with two people that didn't even know each other made it hard to feel a strong connection or desire to see them reunite more than eleven years later.  The creepy ""pimp"" character (Williams) was more than a little disturbing in my opinion, especially when he controlled a bunch of young children. Also I had a big problem with how the last scene of the movie played out. I do not wish to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see the movie, but the logistics of the entire ending scene I thought to be pretty outlandish even for a ""fairy tale"" movie.

Message: 4/5. Music transcending boundaries, not losing faith despite obstacles or disappointment, lamenting the fact that you weren't a child music prodigy...

Overall enjoyable. You've got to have a little appreciation for music in order to really like this one, as well as a little imagination and ability to overlook some of the outlandish portions of the plot.",1209859200,,1525,4.573529411764706

The story is WAY out there, so I took solace in the amazing soundtrack that Kaki King contributed to (the guitarist behind August's unique style).

This movie was made ridiculous in my mind (after all the previous cheese) when visually the piano keys went up in 3rds, and the notes played went down in steps. It was only a second, but it was up close and as a pianist I definitely took notice and it was hard to overlook. ""C'MON, SERIOUSLY?!""

On the plus side, the photography was nice, and the theme of orphaned boy finally uniting with his parents is nice.

On the down side, there was not enough of the classical side of music for me.  Further, the Irish accent of the father was hard to understand.  Overall the plot development seems too unrealistic, not that we all like fantasy now and then, but for some reason, this frustrated me in this film, and I haven't yet been able to articulate it.  Maybe the characters therefore weren't that believable?

Compare this with Sandy Bottom Orchestra and too me, there is no comparison.  I can watch this once or twice a month and never tire.  I will not give August Rush another viewing.  The difference between a five star and three star.",1207872000,,916,4.496969696969697

My wife liked the movie, but she's the one that likes all the sappy heartwarmers. I found this movie unbelievable. It reminded me of all those movies with computer scenes from the 80s like Weird Science where the character create a beutiful women just feeding the computer with pictures from different magazines. I suppose was interesting for those who knew nothing about computers in those days, like me.
Now, back to the movie, perhaps the most shocking part of this film was that Robin Williams plays the villain? Come on!..give me a break!..is actually difficult to hate this guy, is like Pee Wee Herman playing the role of a serial killer?
Anyhow, no one I know can learn the guitar in less than a minute and be enrolled in the Juilliard School in practically the same amount of time. You can not play a guitar by just slapping it. Not only that, but playing the organ the way he does the first time? give me another break! The kid also doesn't know how to conduct an orchestra.
Taking the movie for what it is, it will leave you with a warmed heart, and a new awareness of the music all around you.
Two out of five stars for Freddie's good job as a young actor, other than that everything was fairly disappointing. Most of the movie is pretty good, but the end is totally unrealistic. These two lovers hadn't seen each other for 11 years, and when they do, they hold hands and smile at each other. Thats it?.. no ""Oh my god I've finally found you!"" or..""I missed you so much!""..or maybe at least a  ""Oh hey, what's up?."" again, totally overrated.

HOWEVER, the story was nothing more than warm, fuzzy, fluff.  There were a lot of 'gaps' in the story and the realism was pretty lacking.  I understand this wasn't intended to be a documentary or anything like that, and I wasn't looking for spoon-fed information, I was simply disappointed with the 'movie' as a whole.  The acting side of things was pretty tragic.  Robin Williams was good, in a disturbing way (due to the character), but the storyline and 'depth' in the other characters was pretty shallow.
If you're looking for low-substance, warm, fuzzy, family film ... this one works well.

3115619,4,B0013K7ZUE,"A great family film. It only misses a 5 star rating because of some small confusions... like the need to listen very carefully to be aware of the passage of time. ie. Months pass when August is at Julliard and in the clutches of Wizard. You need to be aware of that. While the guitar playing seems to develop extremely quickly, again we must be aware of the passage of time and that the techniques employed are reasonable quick to learn when using DADGAD tunings. (Perhaps the biggest annoyance was seeing him play piano notes going in reverse to the actual sounds.) There are also 2 deleted scenes that might have been better restored - for understanding - even if it extended the length of the movie. 1. The scene where his mother goes to the orphanage and meets his friend. 2. The scene, underground, where Wizard realises that he has to let him go. All that being so, this is still a 'feelgood' movie where, like a fantasy, one has to suspend reality a little. And it is not beyond reality that perhaps a little 'Mozart-type' prodigy would absorb musical knowledge as quickly as the film suggests. (I have tutored musicians who have developed 10 years ability inside 2 years.) For a similar type story see 'Vitus' - in that film the playing is 'real'.... not faked!

That doesn't take anything away from the movie-you just have to turn off the rational part of your brain and enjoy the movie for what it is, a very entertaining story. The two 'hook up' afterwards at a party for a one night stand in which Lyla gets pregnant. Flash forward to Evan, an 11 year old boy living in a New York orphanage who is teased by the others because he hears music in his head which he believes is his mother & father calling him. Afraid of being adopted or sent to a foster home, he runs away to try and find his parents.

3115628,1,B0013K7ZUE,"I don't know where you were when you saw this, but I was trapped on a plane and almost hypnotized by how deeply rotten to the core it is. The term ""fairy tale"" keeps getting applied to this film, but real fairy tales are carefully crafted allegories, not excuses for insipid and unbelievable storytelling. To say that it is just overly sentimental is also far too kind because this kind of ""product"" is, of course, the result of multiple test-screenings and demographic considerations. In fact, if ever a movie wanted to pander and please every possible viewer / paying unit, it is this one. Stretched beyond thin, it is as if it was robotically assembled; ""pull heart-string A, add sweeping music, insert flashback B (in slow motion), etc."" And it STILL manages to sink even lower with yet another one-dimensional portrayal of a human, as caricatured by Robin Williams (who is as naturally ""street"" as Kathy Lee Gifford)!

Most offensive, however, is that ""August Rush"" ultimately purports to be about the universality and power of art as a mysterious and yet uniquely human language. Yet in it's air-tight bubble of calculated cliches and manipulative schmaltz, it has completely suffocated the very elements that allow for true art to exist. There is no better example of this than in how the film repeatedly illustrates the boy's relationship to music. In the very opening scenes, the director has chosen an internal voice-over to verbally explain how August feels about music in his world, rather than employ the almost limitless language of cinema to creatively show it. Oh, we get lots of sweeping MTV crane and helicopter shots, but this is not what I'm getting at. In this opening voice-over, August explains how music and rhythm is present in almost every facet of nature itself. It's hardly a new idea, but a potentially challenging and beautiful one to consider. Still, the filmmakers won't allow you to actually experience or engage with this philosophy first-hand, which they could have. Instead, for every visual example they provide; the wind, the birds, the urban environment, etc., they have chosen to lay ACTUAL music over, drowning out whatever discoveries you might have shared with August for yourself.

This film has nothing to do with art, or even human beings, really. It's a total betrayal of its subject matter and mistrusts its audience on every level. It offers no challenges or discoveries and, without these, there can be no fairy tales, only mounting successions of highly improbable coincidences, delivered D.O.A., in a pantomime of wonder. Anything by Ed Wood was more heart-felt than this!",1207094400,,2624,5.01605504587156
3115629,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Just like the baseball movie, this is about risk, confidence, and ultimately -- the concept of simply having faith. Being a musician helps -- knowing how music can flow through you; be part of who you are; change your perception of life. After this film I had tears streaming down my face -- as much for the movie experience as for those who will just never ""get"" this film. If you are a person who has no faith -- in anything, anyone or in a higher power, you will either hate this movie or be challenged to the max. Ask yourself -- is there anything you believe in enough to cast it all aside on faith? In this film, all three main characters did just that.",1207008000,,659,4.238095238095238
3115630,3,B0013K7ZUE,"Whether or not the implausible plot of director Kirsten Sheridan's 2007 ""August Rush"" makes much sense or not, the film moves with its own frenetic momentum; the urgent momentum of the music heard inside the head of its main character Evan Taylor a.k.a. August Rush (played by the serious Freddie Highmore of ""Finding Neverland""), musical genius extraordinaire of the caliber of a latter-day Amadeus Mozart.

Ordinary sounds like that of the grass blowing in the breeze and the wind hitting an old brass wind chime filter through this child's brain and transform to melodies of symphonic perfection.  From the first few opening frames of the film, there is no doubt in the mind of the viewer that Evan definitely possesses that quirky quality akin to all masterminds, be it the mathematical autistic savant speaking in logarithms or yet another John Nash hearing aliens speak to him through glimpses of magazine and newspaper text.  Through almost monotonous repetition, Sheridan insures that the audience immerses itself in sensing yet not fully understanding this wondrous creative treat--how often do we get to explore the mind of someone of higher perceptive powers?

Making use of his unique gift, Evan, living in a home for boys, decides that hearing his personal compositions will provide the means to bring his parents to him in a lyrical happy-ever-after.  We hear his music too (thanks to Mark Mancina's soundtrack) and like the fairytale rats of Hamlin follow this Pied Piper to the streets of New York City where Evan becomes synonymous with Dicken's Oliver Twist complete with an acoustic guitar toting Artful Dodger and somewhat manic-prone-to-violence Fagan (a cowboy hat wearing mutton-chopped Robin Williams.)

As Evan wanders through the arch in Washington Square and the abandoned Filmore East Theatre in pursuit of his music, we flash back and forth from the moment of his conception by rock star Louis (the ever intense Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and classical cellist Lyla (America's sweetheart Keri Russell.) Separated by factions that again seem conjured from a world replete with evil stepmothers, the two live their floundering lives in different cities fully conscious of the black hole created by their estranged existences.

As Evan's musical ability purrs into a startling fifth gear, the trio moves steadily towards each other like a convergence of heavenly bodies in the night sky in a somewhat wannabe facsimile of a Christmas miracle exemplified with a hopeful magical star. ZZZZzzzzzzz . . .

Bottom line?  Although ""August Rush"" assembles a fine group of actors to play out one boy's musical rhapsody with all the trimmings, the overall presentation seems overly slick--dusted with a coating of improbable sweetness that may work for family fare if a double dose of sugar is in order but does not contain enough real poignancy to satisfy an adult viewer.  Instead, the film mirrors a tale out of Dickens with all the convenient serendipity and none of the genuine menace to elicit human response or concern.  Highmore pours on the spacey-ness with an almost beatific grin and glow that the best of the litany of saints cannot duplicate while Russell and Rhys Meyers come together with a too-perfect simplicity that moves like a sticky snowball at the light speed of the music.  Williams plays this one too over the top for me--he tries for three dimensional when only one is needed.  Recommended for those who like sweet predictable fairytales.

The ending can seem a little open-ended like you want to see more of a conclusion, but at the same time it seems very appropriate when the main plot of the film is for August (Evan) to have his music bring his parents to him.

It consists of a young boy, wandering around looking for his parents, meeting people who's characters are never developed, staring wide eyed at everything he comes across, then finding his parents.  On the way we learn he is a musical prodigy, which provides the only redeeming quality of the film, the music.

3115641,2,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is a heart-warming, albeit painfully slow at times, story of an orphan boy - a pseudo-Oliver Twist - named Evan Tayler who is the definition of a socially awkward child.  While walking around the streets of New York he meets a wise talking, Boondocks-esque musical prodigy named Arthur who leads him to a group of other musical prodigies.  Evan is escaping from the life of social custody, and following the music in his ears has led him to this unlikely family of vagrant musicians, each with their own speciality (I think I saw a didgeradoo at one point).

These kids are living in an abandoned playhouse, and under the tutelage of a ghetto pied piper named Wizard (Robin Williams) who musically pimps all of the gifted youngsters under his watch.  And, wouldn't you know it, young Evan is a friggin guitar genius; so, he fits in quite well.  In no time at all he usurps Arthur for the Alpha position in the drifter family, and the prefered musical prostitute bringing in cash to Wizard - the musical, philosophical pimp who will do anything to keep his new found meal ticket.

(Yes, you read all of that right, and it's just as ridiculously unbelieveable as I have mentioned.  It's ""Ben Affleck saving the world in Armaggedon""-ridiculous.)

Meanwhile, we find out that Lila and Louis, both socially awkward musicians in their twenties, meet randomly one night at a lame party.  Louis is a guitarist for a somewhat popular band, and he doesn't seem to like crowds.  Yeah, a guitarist who doesn't like crowds.  Lila plays classical music, and the two have a incredibly pointless, random night together - sort of a poor man's Serendipity - and then they part ways the next morning.

Oops, he knocked her up.  Nevermind, it didn't happen.  Oh wait, yeah it did, but the father forged her signature up and gave the baby up for adoption.  (I only put it this way because this is the manner in which the movie gave these facts to the viewer)

In the end, Lila and Louis discover that Evan is their kid, and he is now a successful composer named August Rush who has attended Juilliard and is about to have his own symphony in Central Park...at eleven years old...where his mother just happens to be playing the cello after an 11-year hiatus...and the father just happens to be driving by after playing a gig during his recent refound love of music.  The entire ordeal is done with more foreshadowing and preposterousness than Dolly Parton walking around the corner.  Amongst all the barely connected storylines, they are all reunited happily ever after...despite the eleven year separation.

It's a feel-good movie great for the whole family, and by feel-good I mean completely unbelievable. And by completely unbelievable, I mean there's more realism in Starship Troopers.",1206489600,,2780,4.802521008403361
3115642,3,B0013K7ZUE,"This movie is an okay movie.  I think the music is beautiful, but the premise of the story is similiar to ""Oliver Twist"" in a lot of ways.  Freddie Highmore gives a masterful performance with a child-like innocence, but with a deep sense of maturity.  I was not huge on Jonathan Rhys Meyers or Kerri Russel's performances as they seemed weak compared to Highmore's.  Aside from that, the movie is long and there were definately parts that the movie could have gone without.  It's a very artistic movie and I was a little disappointed by this movie as I had rented it with very high expectations.",1206403200,,595,4.5754716981132075
3115643,4,B0013K7ZUE,"I really liked a lot about this picture - the music is lovely, and I  enjoyed the way that the soundtrack sort of put you inside our young hero's head - you can start to hear the music in a siren or a windchime or a pair of feet walking on wet pavement.  I also really enjoyed the fact that this film's universe isn't violent or cruel.  What a relief after the mean and vicious characters we've had to pay money to watch in other pictures this past season!  And I really like young Freddie Highmore.  It's good to see him in a picture where he's able to shine on center stage.

As to the plot, the similarities to ""Oliver Twist"" are too many to go un-noticed.  A young street musician plays the role of the Artful Dodger, bringing Our Hero back to an abandoned theater swarming with orphaned street kids.  The gang is headed up by a slimey, Fagin-esque Robin Williams, to whom the kids give the money they earn as street buskers.  Instead of a sympathetic magistrate, we have sympathetic social worker and a sympathetic minister of the gospel.

As in the Dickens novel, our young hero gets a taste of the good life at the Julliard School of Music, but Fagin (oops, Williams as ""The Wizard"") is tipped off by the Dodger, and drags our hero back into the street life.  Everything works out in a happy ending, though, and Oliver (oops, August) is happily re-united with his family.

I guess what keeps this from being 5 stars for me is just the blatantness of the story-lifting, and the predictability of it from that point of view.  I really did enjoy the picture, though, and I think it's a wonderful break from the ""gritty"" messes we're so often served up.",1206403200,,1656,4.425742574257426

3115646,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Whoever said a fairy tale had to be animated and include magic, wizards, dragons and the like?  Freddie Highmore sets us up for a fairy tale in the opening sequence, and we are given a whole new one.  And it's certainly a breath of fresh air.

Evan (Highmore) was separated from his mother at birth and sent to live in a boys' home.  He is considered a freak because he hears music in everything and believes his parents will come for him.  He runs away and finally finds a way to put what he hears in his head on paper, and later on show, hoping two certain audience members will be listening.  The music is the high point, as well as Highmore, Russell, and Rhys Meyers.  I highly recommend the soundtrack as well.

Is the story believable?  No, it's a Hollywood movie.  Is it a run of the mill fairy tale?  No.  Welcome to the 21st century.  Listen and enjoy the music.",1206316800,,871,4.302469135802469
3115647,1,B0013K7ZUE,"This film has been widely classified as ""a fairy tale"" for our times. But a fairy tale, as Bruno Bettleheim pointed out long ago, contains gritty elements of psychological realism and represents symbolically through its ogres and witches the dangers which all children confront on the road to maturity.

""August Rush,"" on the other hand is just an indulgent exercise in New Age Wish Fulfillment. It could more accurately be classified not as a fairy tale but, to put it mildly, as ""a vast betrayal of life."" Consider in this regard its opening. A rock musician scores after a first meeting with a classical cellist on the rooftop of a Greenwich Village flat. She learns after their one-night-stand that she's pregnant. Naturally, these two individuals of low responsibility, separated after their only encounter by a controlling Hollywood-type parent, continue to hunger for each over an eleven year period. Yeah, right! Similarly, the controlling parent allows his erring daughter to bear the child, but then forges her signature to give it up for adoption. Shades of pleasing everybody, ""Juno"" or ""Murphy Brown"" style. Out of wedlock liasons are given a pass, so as to be thought daring, but pregnancies are then carried to term, so as not to the offend the pro-life section of the audience. This is once again the Hollywood mentality, trying to have things both ways, beginning with the seemingly daring, but landing on a very neat, conventional trajectory.

The film, sad to say, goes from bed to worse. Children, I'm sure, would quickly see through its escalating preposterousness. Some weak-minded adults, on the other hand, interested in instant uplift, might be inclined to find it ""spiritual"" and ""exhilarating."" As Oscar Wilde said in another context, ""only a man without a heart"" could fail to laugh at the trials and tribulations of the characters in ""August Rush.""

The only bearable performance, for my money, is that of Freddie Highmore, a talented child actor. Unfortunately, however, he may be finding himself, like Haley Joel Osment earlier, pushed into bad roles that undermine his ostensible skills. ""August Rush,"" I'd argue, is Freddie Highmore's ""Pay It Forward."" One hopes he or his agents exercise a better choice over scripts in the future. The worst performance in the film, not surprisingly, comes from Robin Williams, who became an act rather than an actor in ""Good Will Hunting,"" and has yet to recover. Just like Dustin Hoffman in recent roles, he's here playing yet another caricature of a weirdo to diminishing effect. The one star is for Freddie Highmore.",1206144000,,2588,5.070422535211268

Sure, ya, Michael Clayton has Clooney - and some Brit woman we never heard of. But AR has Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell and the fabulous Freddie Highmore - to name a few.  Robin Williams is wiley as the Fagin-esque Wizard and the pizza thing reminds me of Oliver Twist ""Please Sir, I want more!""

3115649,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Have you ever watched a movie that left you simply speechless and fulfilled? Well, August Rush left me feeling that way! I vaguely remember when this movie was released, and not hearing a thing out it. But when it was released on DVD, I said ""what the heck, give it a try"". It was surprisingly, one of the best, well written and well thought out movies that I have read in a long time. I simply loved the story, the acting, the music...everything.

Evan (AKA August Rush) was always sure about two things in life, (1) he heard music in everything, and (2) his parents were looking for him! Starting with vivid imagery and personal narrative, Evan describes how he feels about his life and music, while always feeling different from everyone else. As he begins his personal journey, we see how truly special he is. We soon learn the story behind his birth (one night of passion between two musicians, Louis and Lyla), and how he was eventually put up for adoption, by Lyla's very over protective father, who thinks it is in her best interest. Escaping his group home and ""following the music"", Evan has a series of misadventures as others discover his genius. During his journey, Evan never gives up faith that he will find his parents. And while some try to use Evan (the Wizard, played by Robin Williams), some try to help him (Terrance Howard), some try to find him (Lyla), some befriend him (two lovable and equally talented kids) and some discover him (his unbeknowest father, Louis).

Since so many others have reviewed this movie, I won't say too much more except to watch this movie. You will smile, cry and laugh. It will leave you with a feeling of hope!",1206144000,,1663,4.595959595959596
3115650,5,B0013K7ZUE,"So, why another glowing review.  Everything has been said in the 60+ reviews already on this page and mine will likely never even be read!

Why? Because this movie engages the senses (an amazing score, lush cinematography) and touches the heart from start to finish in ways quite unexpected and rare for films these days. It's a stunner and it makes you want to stand up and clap with joy, (or go on record on Amazon with an enthusiastic review!!)

It is a beautiful fable, a metaphor for a deep and abiding truth that we are all interconnected and can 'listen' and 'hear' the harmonic of love that connects us.  The talented young actor who carries this film (Freddie Highmore) expresses the purity, innocence, and sense of wonder that lies within each of us -- evoked so beautifully in this timeless fable of 'yearning for Home' and 'dreams come true.' And any viewer (of any age - even the most jaded and cynical, I promise you) can relate to this universal theme and (perhaps in spite of oneself) feel uplifted.

This simple little film is a beauty.  It is more than the sum of its parts.  See this film, please!  You'll skip with a lighter step if you do.",1206144000,,1160,4.516746411483253
3115651,5,B0013K7ZUE,"If you have any love for music at all, you'll enjoy this movie.  There's a language that goes along with music...it makes the sounds that the soul wants to speak but can't find words for.  It sings of celebration, joy, hurt, anguish...and other depths of emotion that we can't even begin to explain.  This movie does a wonderful job of expressing that.

As a musician, I actually ached inside watching it because I understood what August heard in the world.  His musical pureness was exquisite.  He didn't understand the capitalist edge he had that Wizard tried to exploit because of his gift.  He didn't understand the importance and grandeur of his accomplishment at Juliard.  He simply heard the music and knew in his heart that it would serve him good in mending the broken relationships of his life.  That is the essence of music...touching the areas of life that otherwise would not be reached.

If you watch this movie with just your eyes, you may not be as delighted with it.  But watch it with your heart and you won't be able to help but stand and cheer!",1206057600,,1064,4.6063829787234045

3115654,3,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush would probably be considered an interesting film for most, but a fascinating film for music lovers.  A somewhat whimsical tale of a gifted child that never knew his parents.  Gifted in that the child hears music all around him, calling to him, almost begging to be recorded and played for others to enjoy.  Never knowing his parents because he was given up for adoption as a baby.  Hoping to somehow connect to his parents and feeling that perhaps music can bring everyone together.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers (of The Tudors and other works) is the father he never knew.  Working with his more natural accent as an Irish rock and roll band member.  Keri Russell (Felicity and others) is the mother who was a featured member of the Philarmonic.  The two 'hook up' at a party, but are kept apart by her father.  Both are obviously gifted musicians in their own right, so they will of course produce a child prodigy.

Mixed in along the way are roles for Robin Williams, Terrence Howard and others that cross paths with the various characters here.  Can fate bring the proper parties together, or can there be no happy ending?  I've probably spoiled (unintentionally) that with my review title, but you've also probably already figured that by the time you read this review or any of the others here (or perhaps you saw the trailers for this film when it was in theatrical release).

The film didn't last that long in theatres, apparently not being able to find it's own voice amongst the rush and crush of other choices that potential movie-goers had to spend their entertainment money on.  That's a shame as parts of the film would be wonderful to view on a big screen.  Not that the high definition transfer for the Blu-ray is bad (nor will the same transfer that will be used for the HD DVD release be), or even the image (by what I've seen) for the DVD version.  No, they translate just fine to the smaller screen, but perhaps could be better enjoyed on a larger canvas.

The film is obviously about music and the music dominates throughout.  Not overwhelmingly so, but it's obvious that sound is a key element here, and dialogue is used more sparingly in conveying the message and interaction between the characters in the story.  The music is well choosen throughout, and helped to earn the film an Academy Award Nomination for one of it's musical selections.  Unfortunately for this film, there was strong competition from several films, so the prize went elsewhere and the film continued to be largely ignored without the 'bump' of being an Oscar winner.

I've rated the film at 3 stars.  Yet again, I think this is a film that deserves a little better, but not that much better.  Some will quite obviously find it quite enjoyable and think that it deserves more.  I understand that thinking and wouldn't argue with those that love the film.  I think most people would enjoy it once through, but not feel compelled to watch it repeatedly.  I could be wrong, but part of what might convince me to purchase a film like this on disc would be having more to explore on the disc.  Unfortunately the studio apparently didn't feel compelled to add much to the disc for this particular under-performer.  A selection of deleted scenes is all that is there.  No making of, no mini-documentary on selecting the music for the film, composing or performing the music, making the actors look believable in being gifted musicians, or anything else.

For most people, I'd recommend renting first.  You may throughly enjoy the film and wish to purchase, but you also may feel it was not something you wished to spend too much money on owning.  Try before you buy here if you can.

A quick nit to pick here on the film.  The use of time within the film, showing events of the past to set up how these characters got to be where they are in modern time is fine, but in showing the characters before the title character is conceived and born the parental characters are later surprisingly unchanged and apparently haven't aged a bit.  I realize that depicting a passage of a little more than a decade isn't easy, but at the same time people change.  You don't appear the same at 20 as you would at 30, or at 25 versus 35.  I wish film makers would put a little more effort into noticing such little things so they don't become distractions to films like this, and so that viewers are given more of a sense of a passage of time.",1205971200,,4420,4.584713375796178

For this viewer the little film is tender and frequently requires suspension of belief, but in the end the idea of the story does indeed bring a tear to the eye.

Based on a story by Paul Castro and Nick Castle and transformed for the screen by Castle and James V. Hart, the premise is that of a fairytale, but an unusual fairytale built around the impact of music.  On one magic night in New York City classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and popular Irish guitarist/singer Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meet on a rooftop, languishing in their own disappointments with life and finding solace in each other's arms, and that night Lyla becomes pregnant, never to see Louis again, and struggling to keep her baby despite her father's demands to abort.  Lyla delivers her baby boy, but the child is immediately taken away (Lyla is told the child was stillborn).  'Evan Taylor' AKA August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is placed in an orphanage, longing for parents he believes he can 'hear' in the music of the spheres. Compelled to find his parents he escapes the orphanage after eleven years and is taken in by  Faginesque Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams) who teaches his street urchins the fine art of pick pocketing and playing music on the streets as buskers.  Renamed August Rush, Evan has uncommon musical talents and rapidly becomes a big money maker for Wizard while at the same time being discovered as a potential pupil for Juilliard by Reverend James (Mykelti Williamson) and his girl singer Hope (Jamia Simone Nash) with assistance from kindly social worker Richard Jefferies (Terrence Howard).  August Rush composes a rhapsody that is to be played in Central Park, a chance to place his music before the world and attract his parents, both of whom have returned to music careers after eleven years absence and learn of the existence of August Rush, their 'unknown son'. And yes, the ending is a happily ever after one...

Kirsten Sheridan directs with a sure hand and a keen eye toward make believe.  The cast is strong, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the musical score, a very mixed bag, provides a suitable background for the story.  This is one of those movies that asks us to go along with a lot of improbable events, but the pleasure of the experience is worth the journey.

Lyla (Keri Russell, of FELICITY), a concert cellist, and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish musician, meet on a New York City roof one evening. What with the moon being full, the two fall in love. And further shenanigans of the heart go down. But, the next morning, Lyla's controlling father speedily puts the kibosh on the romance before it really has a chance to flourish. When Lyla becomes pregnant with Louis' child and delivers, her father puts the baby up for adoption and tells Lyla that her baby had died. Louis's heartbreak and Lyla's tragedy cause them both to give up playing their music, even though Lyla would become a music teacher. So that was eleven years ago.

Cut now to the present, as a young orphan named Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) flees the Walden County Home for Boys. Evan is a weird kid, able to hear music from the most routine of noises in his environment. But he loves music more than food and believes that his parents aren't dead, that, in fact, if he follows the music, it'll lead him to his parents. He ends up following the music to New York City, and ends up in the clutches of Maxwell Wallace, more flashily known as the Wizard (Robin Williams).

The Wizard is an aging street hustler who takes in street kids with musical talent and makes them busk for a living (the Wizard gets a good cut of their earnings, you dig). Hanging out with the Wizard and his underaged worker bees, August Rush (as the Wizard would rename Evan) learns to play music for the first time, starting with the guitar. Further events unfold, and, soon enough, a pastor in church sees August wailing away on the pipe organ and is so impressed that he gets him into Juilliard. And from there it's a short step to this newly discovered musical prodigy conducting his own symphony to the New York Philharmonics in an outside concert in Central Park.

So many coincidences here that Bollywood is jealous. So, meanwhile, Lyla has discovered that her son is alive and begins a desperate search for him. She ends up in New York. Simultaneously, Louis has regained the itch to play his music and rejoins his old band. He also ends up in New York. And, by the movie's climax, everybody ends up in Central Park.

SPOILERS end.

Here's my two cents: Let's not get it twisted, AUGUST RUSH is meant to be a fable. And you have to buy into the film being a fable if you're gonna enjoy the viewing experience. Otherwise, it may get on your last nerve. Is this movie manipulative? Yes. Is AUGUST RUSH so ""sweet"" a film that diabetics aren't medically cleared to glimpse even its trailer? Hells, yeah. Do coincidences pile on more ridiculously than L.A. traffic on the 405 Freeway? Fo'shizzle! But I'm still giving it three stars. Mostly, I guess, it's 'cause I'm a sap, a sucker, a target audience. I just dig feel-good films and pictures which cling to the idea (or wish) that there's a higher purpose to things. That love and magic and music can carry the day. That wouldn't exactly suck, would it? Sue me, I got that optimist schtick going on.

But this is the part now where I kind of kick the movie in the groin. Thing is, man, are we ever asked to accept so many inconsistencies and leaps of logic. Yes, clearly AUGUST RUSH is intended to be a fantasy film, but even the most fantastical of fantasies must have some grounding, some rules to follow. AUGUST RUSH, in several scenes, just doesn't play fair. Since this is a fable, I get that Evan is able to suddenly, masterfully play the guitar (after messing about with it some during the night). I can swallow that. And the same with the piano. But I draw the line at Evan all of a sudden capable of composing maniacally after merely glancing at a music sheet (Is there, somewhere, a deleted sequence where he at least first studies notes and stuff for a bit?).

Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell punch in with some very good acting. And I truly wish they could've gotten more scenes together, as their characters are very engaging and rootable. The high points for me are actually the scene with Meyers and Russell having their cute meet and the scene with Meyers and Freddie Highmore dueting on guitars (easily the musical highlight of the film). Come to think of it, the musical sequences happen to provide some of the better parts of this film. And if Meyers is really doing his own singing, then color me truly appreciative. Freddie Highmore was pretty good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Neverland-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0007CNXUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000BB1MI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition)</a>. Here, he's the eponymous lead, but his acting, while sensitive, borders on being too precious. Next time, maybe ease up on the ethereal. The other two actors of note are Terrence Howard and Robin Williams. Howard is woefully underused as a concerned social worker and Williams is irritatingly overused (Seriously, Robin, what the hell happened? You were a decent actor for a while.). But Howard barely makes an impact, while Robin Williams checks in with one big fat hairy false note after another. He really doesn't do a good enough job of sinking into the skin of his role. So, when all's said and done, all I see is Robin Williams playing Robin Williams, and playing him awfully. I pretty much cringed everytime dude was on the screen.

A bit of fine tuning here, a bit of scene cutting there (like, all of the Robin Williams scenes), and, who knows, this could've been a much better film (Another thing that grated on me was the sappy and too abrupt ending). Still, if you can buy the outrageous premise and tolerate the incessant cloyingness and the rampant sentimentality...If you can not be annoyed at the film's blatant and clumsy attempts to orchestrate the audience's emotions (since every film does this)...And if you keep to heart the fact that AUGUST RUSH is a fable and so deserves a break from the Department of Keeping It Real, well, you might end up enjoying this. Me, even though I'm a bit horrified at the sheer over-the-topness of it all, I'm still leaning towards being generous. I see that this film wears its heart on its sleeve, and I salute that. And that it decided to go all balls out for what it wants, and that it fully commits to its music. Respect to that. I give props to the movie's hopeful message, which is that music unites. I'm just glad Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell were there to ground things. AUGUST RUSH, ultimately, ends up being flawed magic. But still magic.

And, by the way, that nine year old girl, Jamia Simone Nash, is a star waiting in the wings. She's got impressive pipes.",1205625600,,6915,4.882453151618399

The description talks about magic, but the greatest magic in it is love. It tells the story of a couple who is very talented musically.  Their talent comes from a passion they feel toward the music they hear around them, including the music from each other. This passion leads to a pregnancy, wanted by the girl, but unwanted by her father.  He's not a terrible villain.  He wants the best for her,and leads her to believe that her baby died during birth. The baby is a pleasantly odd little boy who hears the music around him. To the joy of the bullies in the children's home,he believes that some of what he hears is the music of his mother and father calling to him. The story unfolds as he leaves the home to search for the music. What unfolds has an echo of Oliver Twist, but not.  A wonderful movie!",1205625600,,931,4.395348837209302
3115669,5,B0013K7ZUE,First of all I have read a couple of other reviews and I don't think you need to write a synopsis of the whole plot line in a review.  This might take away from discovering the magic of a film to someone who hasn't seen it yet.  So that being said I will keep my review simple and to the point.  I found this movie to be amazing and awe-inspiring!!  I am a music teacher and I have always felt that music is my best friend.  Someplace to escape to when the world around me was not so great.  I do think that music connects us as human beings.  It is a God given gift and like August I can find music and all kinds of noise from the chirping of birds to the hustle and bustle of a busy city street.  If you believe in the power of music to bring people together than you must see this movie.  It will lift you up and help you to have faith in a world where life is often times difficult.,1205539200,,886,3.8777777777777778
3115670,5,B0013K7ZUE,"First of all I want to make it clear that I absolutely loved this movie.  The story is very beautiful and moving.  But the key to enjoying this movie is to realize that it is a fairy tale and not a typical drama or thriller.  Anyone familiar with musical theater or opera are used to suspending their normal skepticism to unlikely or even impossible plot situations and instead enjoying the heightened emotional reality that is portrayed.  This movie is not about clever plot twists or dialogue.  It is about the power of music and of love.  Those ideas are more important than even the characters in this movie.  For those of you who can not stomach the idea of that, then this movie is not for you.  But for those of you who enjoyed ""Across the Universe,"" ""Big Fish,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" hey, even ""Il Postino"" then you will probably have the artistic maturity to enjoy this film.

Being a professional musician and music teacher gave me in an interesting perspective on this film.  On the one hand, I can fully appreciate what the character Evan is implying with his line ""The music is all around you, all you have to do is listen.""  Music is simply sound, repeating vibrations in the air that are caused by all things that move.  Our music was at some point in the beginning derived from the sounds of nature, and I could tell that the composer tried to make the soundtrack sound initially more ""natural"" by using a lot of open octaves and fifths, the kind of harmony that is by far most prevalent in nature.  I was also deeply touched by the idea that the music ""of one's soul"" could attract another person.  The ancient Greeks believed in ""the music of the planets"" and the music of one's soul, in addition to our ""audible"" music.  The philosophers Plato, Boethius, Aristotle and others  came up with the ""doctrine of ethos"" which lies at the heart of this movie: that the harmonies of nature and the mind are inter-related with and affect the harmonies we create and enjoy in music.  The fact that music alone can elicit emotions in us proves that at least some of this ancient philosophy is true.

On the other hand, listening in closer to the soundtrack leaves me a little disappointed.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers is just barely good enough of a singer to get by as a professional musician--even for a rock singer--and his versions of ""Moondance"" and ""Something Inside"" start to sound like open mic at a karaoke night.  And I was sad to listen later to ""August's Rhapsody"" and find it is full of cinematic music cliche's and uninspired harmonic movement.  But I did not notice any of these things when I watched the movie (which is amazing for me) because of the effectiveness of the gestalt of the movie.  With a little effort to curb a desire to nit-pick, I enjoyed this movie so much that I would say it is one of the best I have ever seen.",1205539200,,2843,4.51171875
3115671,5,B0013K7ZUE,"So many reviews have focused on the ""Oliver Twist"" subplot to this film and failed to see the genius in the true structure.  August Rush is a clever inversion of classic Anastasia tales, where it is the parents, not the wayward child, who need to be reminded of whom they were meant to be.  On a spiritual level, this film has kinship to the legends of the reincarnation of the Buddha and the Christian emphasis on the importance of children in being able to perceive the heavenly realms.  Little Evan-August is music incarnate who seeks not only to restore his wayward parents, but to harmonize a discordant creation.

Schmaltzy and predictable, AUGUST RUSH will still manage to please most movie-goers. The basic ingredients make this so: a healthy helping of a cute young kid (Freddie Highmore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory/dp/B000BB96M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>), a dose of a busted-up, romantic, musical couple (Keri Russell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrubs/dp/B000AJJNI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrubs</a>, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Match-Point/dp/B000EQHXNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Match Point</a>), and the sprinkling of a slimy vagabond (Robin Williams,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Feet/dp/B00005JPCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Feet</a>).

Highmore has come a long way in his short life. Having immensely enjoyed his portrayal as Peter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Neverland/dp/B0007CNXUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Neverland</a>, I have followed the career path of this super-young-star with interest. Most recently he's starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00005JPNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spiderwick-Chronicles/dp/B00005JPXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a>, two blockbuster films. Whoever his agent is, they've done a fantastic job.

But Highmore has never taken on a role quite as focused as August Rush before. He tended to be overshadowed by the larger than life actors that played beside him (Johnny Depp, Anjelica Huston, etc.). But this time, the focus is all on his character, Evan/August Rush. His name change from Evan to August is affected by the wayward homeless musician ""The Wizard"" played by Robin Williams. The slime-factor is high for Williams here, higher than I've ever seen from him. This also made the story much more interesting and made you dislike Williams' Wizard character in the extreme.

The love story between Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is executed well if a bit distant and unrealistic. Their one night stand that results in a pregnancy becomes the culminating factor that binds all of the characters together. Well ...that ...and music, of course.

Evan (Highmore) is lost amidst the U.S. orphanage industry until he eventually makes good his escape. He carries with him only his belief that music will somehow connect him with his unknown parents. He's lived music his entire, short life, so whenever he comes into contact with an instrument (be it a guitar or a piano) he quickly grasps its workings and can play it within moments. A prodigy, he's soon called by those that know him. Pulling him away from his dreams, however, is The Wizard, a man who wants to personally capitalize on Evan's astounding abilities by prostituting him to the highest bidder ...the highest bidder willing to pay his manager (i.e., The Wizard).

Juilliard is offered up to Evan, and he quickly surpasses all those before him. But he still hasn't found his parents (who are also musicians), and a concert in New York's Central Park soon beckons them together. It's so sweet it'll make your eye-teeth ache.

Even with its overly-sweet beginning, middle, and end, August Rush is something of a must for those who enjoy unique musical playing and the process of melodious discovery.

3115678,5,B0013K7ZUE,"In the end, Faith is a yearning for Home that's stronger than Death itself. Many of the great spiritual sages have said this in some form, including Robert Frost, Frederick Buechner, Rob Bell and Jesus himself.

Of course, this all depends on how we conceive the idea of ""Home"" -- and ""August Rush"" takes the evolving ""music video"" genre into a transcendent, higher plane to explore one boy's profound yearning for a ""Home"" he never even knew, first hand. If you want something to be thankful for this year, buy this gloriously inventive movie that uses music as a metaphor for this abandoned boy's transcendent desire to reunite his shattered family.

Freddie Highmore plays August Rush, whose fantastical musical gifts turn the whole story into a fable about the deepest human desires for Home. The movie borrows liberally from ""Oliver Twist,"" with Robin Williams playing a desperate and, eventually, an absolutely despicable Fagin-like character. Williams is a street-savvy con man who teaches abandoned children to become street musicians in the hope of someday striking it rich by managing a true musical star.

At first, this Fagin discovers and befriends August -- but, when the boy's musical talents blossom, he winds up nearly destroying the boy.

While that may make the movie sound like a rewarming of leftover storylines, the homage to Charles Dickens only adds to the fairy-tale quality of the film. In fact, it's the magical fusion of musical styles throughout the movie -- from rock and folk to classical to jazzy new renditions of natural and urban soundscapes -- that make this a theatrical experience you won't want to miss.

Note to Rob Bell fans! If you love Rob's Nooma film, ""Rhythm"" -- well, ""August Rush"" is like a feature-length meditation on Rob's ""Rhythm"" theme. It's not as theological as Rob's reflection -- but it's the same message loud and clear with similar creative elements in the storytelling.

""August Rush"" opens with the abandoned boy who will become famous as a musical prodigy standing all alone in a lush green field of chest-high grasses, conducting the breezes that paint swirls in the moving sea of green and raise whooshing sounds into a symphony of natural noise.

He narrates the opening sequence, inviting us to: ""Listen! Can you hear it? The music? I can hear it everywhere,"" he says. ""In the wind. In the air. In the light.""

By the end of this film, you'll be hearing it, too, and soaring with little August as high as you'll let this glorious music carry you.",1205020800,,2512,4.894117647058824

Instead you suspend believe, get caught up in the story's mystical web and are transported to a land where dreams come true and the bonds of love and music draw you in completely.

The eclectic music was brilliant and mezmerizing.  The cinematography was thoughtful and well edited.  The actors were all well cast, (including  minor and supporting) all were compelling and believabvle in their parts, especially the brilliant young actor, Freddie Highmore who plays the boy music prodigy. The story builds at a nice pace, including the dramas of finding and losing throughout.  Sure the ending is predictable, but who cares when you have already been drawn in and you are rooting for that predictable end to happen?  It is magical and totally engaging, the kind of movie that makes you want to clap at the end (which my daughter and I did as did others in the theater.)  The trouble with critics (who see way too  many movies) is that they have lost their sense of wonder and delight, having already been there and done that from their perspective.

AUGUST RUSH was never meant to succeed on its plot.  It is the execution that makes all the difference.  As previously stated, when all the cinematic elements are right on:  acting, cinematography, editing, casting, music, direction, set and location, the result is a winner

I expected a somewhat emotional string playing feel-good movie along the lines of a long line of those that have gone before it. The previews didn't do it justice.

If you love music, if you love creativity, if you love against-all-odds feel good stories, you are going to want to see this film.

The impossibility of the yeah-right plot actually works if you get pulled into the story. Imagine a scene from Hook with the Lost Boys, imagine Fievel gazing at the moon singing ""Somewhere Out There"" and Pinocchio's longing to be real, and his imprisonment, and you get a sense of Evan aka August Rush's journey to becoming found. Add Mr. Holland's Opus and you have an idea of the pulling together of events into a symphonic ""no way, but if it could happen that would be so cool"" finale. There is a some cheese and some serious emotional strumming going on, but because the film is full of longing, searching, and seeking, which is pretty much the human condition, I found August Rush to be soul-marking like all things beautiful and poignant. If you are moved by music and art, if stories of lost being found, and wrongs being righted, and the good guys getting a break, then August Rush is for you.

Very little bleeping language, and sex is completely behind the scenes. Who says a film has to have sex and f-bombs to work? There is a bit of violence, a fight between brothers with thrown fists and some blood. A few scenes are scary because one particular character is emotionally unstable and throws a mean temper tantrum, so really sensitive kids may have an issue or two.

The entire film is love honoring and respectful of humanity, beauty and the audience. God is treated with respect as is the church. I saw so many spiritual allegories that I quit counting so I could absorb the film. The only things that bugged my cynical self were too many blank faced closeups. And when the laws of reality make something not even close to possible, i.e. during a packed-out, standing-room-only concert, two characters walk parallel through a mass of people toward the front of a stage and can actually get through and unmolested at that.

I couldn't buy this earnest film for one minute. I found the story,itself, to be so full of holes, that swiss cheese had better consistency than this film. I understand the premise of this film,and it is certainly not without merit,but I will only suspend belief only so far. AUGUST RUSH seemed to be a 2007 version of ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Annie"" with a neat and sharply edited soundtrack to make up for it's totally implausible premise. As a musician,myself,who went to conservatory,I could
not buy Keri Russell performing the Elgar Cello Concerto,much less getting an invite to the prestigious Central Park Concert after an eleven year hiatus from her cello. Only the ""being in sync with the universal rhythm"" could have pulled that one off. Jacqueline DuPre,as talented as she was,could not have done that in her lifetime! Evan,whose name is changed to ""August Rush"" by a Faginesque Robin Williams,learns instantly to play the guitar like a pro and his genius is discovered and exploited when he brings his tips back to Robin Williams, who houses UNDETECTED street urchin musicians in an abandoned Manhattan Theatre.
The final and biggest hole occurs at the end when Jonathan Rhys Meyers is musically drawn to the concert in the park where Evan ""August"" is conducting his inspired rhapsody that just came to him. Meyers serendipitously pushes his way to the front of the enormous crowd there to find Keri Russell after eleven years,he grabs her hand,nods to August....hello? did anyone ever tell him that HE was the father of this child?
For all of the smart editing and clever ideas that this film had, the story itself is pure ridiculous. The only thing that impressed me was that Jonathan Rhys -Meyers performed his own vocals. Highmore and Russell very obviously are not really performing and the quick edits hope to dazzle the viewer and keep them off balance from that fact. Some of the cuts of Russell playing both the Bach E Major Concerto and The Edward Elgar Concerto are deplorable with incorrect hand positions and simply on the wrong strings. Some people won't notice or even care about such things, but when you study music this film is like a history major seeing Ben-Hur with a wrist watch on! The editors were savvy to cut in and out in the music sequences in order to get that dizzying effect of the swirling of music, but all the guitar and cello coaching did not remotely pay off for me. Meyers was believable because he did his own work. This threw the believability factor of this film off for me. Meyers was spot-on, while Highmore and Russell were not. Why not find three REAL musicians?

Was this film destined to end on the right note? Yeah...there was never a doubt about it. It struck all the wrong chords with me. Cheesy and hokey are words that come to mind,but,hey,it's only a film .You won't get upset with my humble opinion as long as you are flowing with the rhythm of the universe. I am obviously out of sync and freely admit it! Here come the hateful votes...I can feel you wanting to push that button!",1199923200,,3664,4.696734059097978

I must admit, the first time I saw the movie, I walked away from the theatre unsure of how I felt, feelings of wonder and sarcasm battling one another, much like the dueling guitars in the park.
However, upon seeing it a second time, I was completely sold. I loved this movie and immediately went home and ordered the soundtrack.
I wish Hollywood made more movies like this.
Some may view the work as sappy and totally unbelievable. But the movie does accomplish it's goal of communicating with the audience through the music. Moreover, it assures people of their purpose and direction in the world, and sends a clear message to be brave enough to belive in something, to be brave enough to want more in the world.
It was a feel good movie with a message of hope and promise and faith. For two hours I forgot how defeated and weery the world had made me feel. Everyone should see this film.

3115696,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Not since Forrest Gump Have I cried so much at a movie. Not since Forrest Gump have I left a movie feeling so touched to my very core.

""August Rush"" is a sweet, captivating story about an 11-year-old musical prodigy and it showcases the power of his simple but persistent and steadfast faith to make the impossible, POSSIBLE. It's a story that is very well done, very tenderly told and incredibly inspiring and uplifting.

The music is wonderful and the acting is all first-rate. As another reviewer said, I'm not one for movie soundtracks, but this is one I plan to order straight away. The 11-year-old musical prodigy (played by Freddie Highmore) is a delightful actor for the part and while I'm one of those people who doesn't really care for flicks with cutesy kids, this movie melted my heart into a puddle of tears.

It also provides a keyhole peak at how truly gifted musicians ""hear"" and experience the world. Speaking as someone who has struggled and struggled to write a few simple books, it was a pleasure to have an insight on how a true genius views the typically laborious process of creation.

The prevailing theme that I took from this movie is this: If we could strip away the many layers of fear, doubt, regret, guilt and all those other dark, burdensome emotions then it'd be easier for us all to find our own ""Insular tahiti.""

I highly recommend ""August Rush"" for anyone who has a heart and I recommend it even more for people who want to see a movie that leaves them with a reassuring hope that sometimes, things really are ""too good NOT to be true.""",1197849600,,1573,4.5638297872340425

Twelve years later, that boy, who will go by the name August Rush (Highmore), is in an orphanage.  He runs away to New York, where he discovers he has musical talent.  He believes that if he can make his parents hear his music, they will find him.

""August Rush"" is hokey, but harmless.  It is a nice movie that will be enjoyed by many, but there is not much substance to it.

3115701,5,B0013K7ZUE,"11-year-old Evan wants nothing more in life than to find his parents, or for them to find him. Labeled a freak by his fellow boys home residents it isn't long before he finds himself on the streets of New York in search of the mother and father he never knew. Like a fish out of water, the sights and sounds of the city that never sleeps are at once overwhelming and intoxicating. In every thumping foot, squealing tire, barking dog and rattling chain he hears a rhythm. Music. Harmonics no one hears but him. He knows if he just follows the music somehow his parents will find him. What he doesn't know is that his parents have no idea he exists.

Ten years ago his mother, Lyla (Keri Russell), a gifted celoist, was a young prodigy herself when she met Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the talented lead singer and guitarist for an Irish rock band. Immediately they share a bond, and their night together changes everything. Can the power of music bring this family of strangers back together again?

Don't let the somewhat un-inspiring title August Rush fool you. This movie is a heart-warming film with a rich narrative, visually diverse settings, and a lush original music score. Freddie Highmore's spot-on performance as Evan, who soon takes up the moniker August Rush, immediately invokes our sympathy. We truly care what happens to this bright-eyed, innocent boy who hasn't let himself become jaded by his harsh environment. (If he looks familiar it's probably because of his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Finding Neverland fame. He played the lead child roles in both.)

But it's not just Highmore who carries this movie. Every actor nails their role beautifully. Keri Russell (perhaps known best for the TV show Felicity) is a natural on the screen, skillfully bringing to life the character of Lyla both as a naive young woman and a passionate mother. Robin Williams' supporting role as a music pimp to a brood of unwanted yet musically gifted children cinches that he can play the deeper roles right alongside his lighter comedy ones. You'll also want to take notice of Terrence Howard's performance as social worker Richard Jeffries, a man in the system who genuinely cares for the kids under his care but often finds his hands frustratingly tied.

A few times suspension of disbelief is called for as August Rush is more about the fantastic than the realistic. It's a little hard to believe Evan is able to play both the guitar and organ like a master (not to mention conduct an orchestra) without ever having seen or touched the instruments before in his life. But you really don't mind. This movie has enough heart to carry it above and beyond those moments. Its portrayal of music's magic, that powerful tug on the human heart and soul, sets it apart from your average film tackling the same subjects.

Parents will appreciate the filmmaker's tact in portraying Lyla and Louis' one-night stand. No more than the beginnings of a passionate kiss are shown. A few swear words (h-- and d--) probably aren't appropriate for youngsters since several are uttered by children, but they really did have their place in showing you the hard existence of some of the street kids.

August Rush reminds us that amidst the hardships there truly is some good left in this world. You'll come away from this movie with a greater appreciation of music's power, not to mention the power of love and family. Definitely worth seeing more than once.

3115704,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Some people hear the rhythm in a step, the strident beauty of a police siren, the whip of a powerline in the wind.  Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) doesn't get a decent night's sleep in the orphanage because of it.  His fellow inmates call him freak because he believes both his parents are living and they'll come for him--if only he call out with the music that connects them.

As he says, ""I believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales."" So, Evan decides after eleven years and some days to escape the orphanage and go find the music--and his parents.

Even ends up in New York City with zero street smarts.  He really doesn't even know how to cross the road. A fortunate encounter puts him near Arthur (Leon G. Thomas III), a street busker his age who's willing to help--for a price. Arthur introduces him to Wizard (Robin Williams) who gives musically talented street kids a place to stay in exchange for half their take. The Wizard quickly discovers that Evan, who he renames August Rush, is a prodigy and is making some plans for the lad.

Meanwhile, we learn that Even's mom Lyla Novacek (Kerri Russell) had only been with Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) one night. The Julliard educated cellist was in an accident while pregnant and her father decided to sign her name and give up her son--telling Lyla that he'd died.  Instead of the stage career her father envisioned, Lyla mostly gave up music and taught--til Julliard called her for a special concert in Central Park.

Louis has always longed for Lyla, the girl who got away.  He gave up his music and became a manager.  When he brings a girl to meet his family, they play a song he'd written for the band after Lyla's departure from his life.  He's determined to find Lyla.  When he believes she is married, he ends up in New York with no particular goals in mind except to find his music again.

""August Rush"" is just as much about the musical ties that bind us as the three people whose stories it tells.  In my opinion, the best performances were the kids: Evan-August, Arthur and Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). This trio kept you captivated and cheering.

Of course, the soundtrack is fabulous.  You have Kaki King on the guitar as well as vocals from John Legend and John Ondrasik (Five for Fighting fame). I'm ordering the soundtrack tonight and I really don't often like movie soundtracks well enough to order.

I wasn't the only person who'd give this film 5 stars.  This is one of the rare films I've attended where many of the audience stood and applauded at the end.  While this is a family film, I did notice that some of the younger children got restless and needed some explanation of what was going on.",1195948800,,2697,4.558091286307054

It's so inspirational, and the music is so different and amazing. I loved it. A beautifully made film with such a lovely message.

3115707,5,B0013K7ZUE,"""August Rush"" is a fairy tale. It doesn't have princes, princesses, evil stepmothers, witches, or big bad wolves, but it's a fairy tale nonetheless. And as such, it tells a story that resonates so strongly with its audience that it casts a magic spell. This movie is told in the language of music, and it exemplifies the harmonic connections between people, the rhythmic bonds that can never be broken in spite of distance and time. It's also told in the language of faith, of the belief that love will indeed conquer all. No, this is not a realistic idea, but that's not the point. Isn't it nice that we have films like this to escape to when realism is bringing us down? Isn't it wonderful when we find that one film that can raise our spirits? ""August Rush"" was that film for me, and I recommend it to anyone in need of a rejuvenating emotional boost.

The film stars Freddie Highmore as an orphan named Evan Taylor, a quiet yet determined musical prodigy. He was born as the result of a chance encounter between two musicians: an Irish rock guitarist named Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and a classically trained American cellist named Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell). While living in New York City, they met and separated through twists of fate--Lyla's controlling father (William Sadler) doesn't take the news of her unplanned pregnancy very well, and when she's hit by a car and injured, he uses that opportunity to make her believe that her baby did not survive. In reality, the baby was delivered and put into the legal system as a parentless orphan. Lyla and Louis go their separate ways, believing that they would never see each other again.

In the present day, their eleven-year-old son Evan lives in an orphanage with a number of broken-spirited boys. They're so disillusioned that they bully him into believing as they do. They constantly tell him that no one is coming for him, that his ability to hear music in everything makes him nothing more than a freak. And they will not stand for his belief that he actually hears the music of his parents calling out to him. But Evan refuses to sink to their level of hopelessness; he runs away to New York City, where the music seems to be beckoning him towards his destiny. It's there he meets Wizard (Robin Williams), a shady musician who houses a number of musically inclined children in an abandoned theater. He, too, is beaten down by life, so much so that he uses these children for his own financial gain. When he discovers Evan's natural ability to play the guitar, he gives him the pseudonym August Rush and forces him to perform in parks and on street corners.

Lyla, meanwhile, is living in Chicago as a music teacher. Single and without any children, she seems complacent yet stable in her new life. But all that changes when (1) she's offered a change to once again play with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and (2) she learns that her baby did not die eleven years ago. With a powerful yet unexplainable determination, she travels back to New York on a quest to find her long lost son, a quest that will hopefully be added by her playing of the cello. Hoping to help find Evan is Richard Jeffries (Terrence Howard), a social worker who met the boy when he was still living at the orphanage.

And then, of course, there's Louis, who has since gone on to be a businessman in San Francisco. His band members haven't forgiven him for leaving, least of all his brother, Marshall (Alex O'Loughlin). But worst of all, Louis hasn't been able to forgive himself, and upon seeing footage of himself performing on stage, he remembers the love he felt for Lyla. The memory is so strong that's he vows to reunite with her. This journey of finding lost love leads him from Chicago back to New York City, where he's inspired to rejoin with his band and restart his singing career. Much like his son--whom he doesn't know exists--Louis is a gifted guitar player; one can hear his passion and energy with every chord, and his music operates at the same frequency as Lyla's cello playing.

As you can probably tell, most of the film thrives on serendipity, and it gets more and more prominent with every passing scene. A kind-hearted pastor eventually takes Evan in, and when made aware of his musical genius, they send him to the Julliard School of Music. He composes a piece within the first six months of his stay, one that the faculty believes is good enough to be performed. Thus sets into motion the events leading to one of the most satisfying endings of any movie I've seen this year, a scene so touching that I was in awe. As I listened to Evan's ""August's Rhapsody,"" I felt as if I had been enveloped in the folds of hope, love, and happiness; the earthiness of the chimes blended perfectly with the smoothness of the violins and the energy of the guitars, all of which made his unwavering faith in the power of connection perfectly clear.

This is the magic of ""August Rush,"" a film so wonderful that I cannot recommend it enough. It's a modern day fable with a timeless message, and it comes across so well that I never once stopped to consider how implausible it is. Plausibility doesn't even come into play, here. What does come into play is the emotional impact, the sense that we can get something out of it if we surrender to pure fantasy. Evan opens the film by saying, ""Music is all around us--all we have to do is listen."" This is one of the year's best films, and if you keep that quote in mind when seeing it, you'll be more inclined to agree.",1195516800,,5529,4.574167507568113

3348118,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This is one of my favorite ""feel good"" movies.  It's a love story told from the perspective of the three lead characters, who share their love of music: the orphan who believes his parents are alive and that his music will bring them together, the mother who thinks her son died at birth, and the father who got separated from his true love when her parents moved the family away, and he has almost given up hope that he'll ever find her.  It has that magic feeling that reminds me of being a kid and going to Disneyland.  Very heartfelt story with a bit of a fantasy flavor. It's a bit like ""Oliver"" with Robin Williams playing the Fagan role.  Although it's predictable, I enjoy the way the story unfolds.",1494892800,,707,4.415384615384616

3348128,5,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is a story both of excellent music and of the journeys of the human heart.  I won't spoil the movie for others by getting too deeply into the plot, but is well crafted and intricate.  Some of the guitar work is among the most innovative and startling of any that I've heard in 60 years of interest in the instrument.  August's organ solo and major symphonic debut piece might send chills down your spine.

Freddy Highmore is brilliant in the title role (a pseudonym from his street life in New York City).  He is well supported by Keri Russell as Lyla Novachek -- his mother --  Jonathon Rhys Meyers as Louis Connolly -- Lyla's lover for just one night and the father of August-- and Robin Williams as Maxwell ""Wizard"" Wallace, a small-time promoter and con artist who tries to exploit August in a ring of NYC panhandling kids to rival anything from David Copperfield. There is no way this intricate fantasy of a lost child prodigy can be regarded as low-key.  But it will engage and entrance you.",1492819200,,1009,4.541436464088398

After trying for 30 minutes, my family and I finally gave up as when the movie would play, it was completely pixelated and we simply couldn't watch it. We tried rebooting internet connection, buffering, nothing worked and we had very good internet signal. Usually when this happens, amazon is great at contacting via email to apologize and refund the charge, but sadly this didn't happen this time. Pretty disappointed in amazon with this one. Would give zero stars if I could.",1483401600,,553,4.770833333333333

3348295,3,B0013K7ZUE,"I rented it the first time, it tugged at my heart strings. Then I bought it, re-watched, and felt it to be a poorly developed and simply preposterous story line. The kid being THAT much of a prodigy that he could be told what notes are then suddenly (same day and no further education) knows how to WRITE all the music on the wall was sheer ridiculocity. They could have put in things that required leaps of faith but not pure impossibilities and accomplished the same willing suspension of disbelief that carries the audience. This movie asked me to think of this boy as inhuman, which decreased the enjoyment, if only to me. I just kept thinking ""Oh come on!""",1468627200,,661,4.516666666666667

3348304,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time.  Perhaps because I'm a musician and so it is very meaningful to me.  It is a moving story about a boy who is born with an incredible gift, but is orphaned at birth.  He is convinced that if his parents hear his music they will come for him.  There is so much more to the movie than that but I don't want to ruin any of it for you!  I highly recommend this film.  Kerri Russell and Jonathan Rhys are amazing as August's incredibly talented musician parents.  Robin Williams also plays an amazing role as Maxwell ""Wizard"" Wallace, a vagrant musician who teaches homeless children music, and uses them as street musicians to make money for him.  Freddie Highmore plays Evan Taylor aka August Rush the orphaned boy searching for his parents. There are so many other amazing actors and actresses that I don't have space to name them all. I found the music in this movie to be fantastic as well and had to download the whole sound track!",1466726400,,977,4.388888888888889

3348309,5,B0013K7ZUE,"It's not a new movie, but it's extraordinary. Both a friend of mine and I (who watched the movie separately) were so moved at the end that we couldn't speak. Some of the reviewers at the time it was first released failed to grasp the point, I think. This is not fundamentally a sappy story about a family coming back together. Rather, it's a breathtaking celebration of the mystical nature of music and sound. It's effect was so powerful that everything I heard when I returned home after seeing the movie was magnified, and everything I did seemed to suddenly have a new rhythm to it.

3348419,5,B0013K7ZUE,"One of my Very Most Favorite movies...Seeing how he puts sounds he hears(everything)...into a his own symphony/beats...and hears sounds louder as his mind does...I haven't EVER Seen ANYTHING like this that made me feel more normal...and happy to be me...And: realize I have a gift...(Except I Definjitely don't have the gift he has of writing the music onto paper and having the knowledge of the notes, chords, etc...)..I guess it would have been Really good for me to go to a school of music at some point to gain that knowledge...while I was young, and had no brain injuries...*sigh...I believe everything happens for a reason, and this movie definitely brings me So Much Joy and Happiness...:-) I can hardly wait to get that $40,00 piano that isn't necessarily electric...(I Can hear AND Feel the difference...no matter how Nice they say they are), but that piano is natural with strings, hammers, But Also a digital system put in to Record whatever I sit down and play...and Then, I can take the disc out, and gp print out my music...(my therapy...where I get my emotions out...

Never has any filmaker, writer, director and acting so brilliantly combined a number of exrraordinary underlying themes or messages intertwined with the main theme that leaves you wondering, contemplating, and in awe of what you experienced watching this, for days, weeks, months, years following.  The story line is superbly portrayed as well and is rich in imagination, colorful characters, music, artistic expression on so many levels in so many ways and where  the main characters, the unexpected happenings, and the suspense as it builds, hold your interest throughout. Finally, it is inspiring in its message that will have a different interpretation for every individual and remain hauntingly unforgettable as a tribute to hope, to music, to love, and to life itself. It is a masterpiece that the creator or it must be of an incredibly outstanding, artistic and deeply aware mind.",1448582400,,923,5.1879194630872485

3348470,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This is a great movie that teaches people about how we are all connected, and in this movie music is that connection.
This is a story about a boy who is gifted with music talent, a nautral and a genuis, who suffered adversity from birth yet became who is was meant to be regardless of what others tried to make him out to be because of his economic/social history and his musical intelligence.
This is a story of how small moments from caring adults can touch and change the life of a child in an instant.
I Strongly recommend this movie to adults and children, of all ages.
This movie is a strong reminder of how we are all connected and what you do counts!",1448150400,,658,4.272
3348471,2,B0013K7ZUE,"As a little girl, I loved going into the darkened theater to be transported by the images on the screen.  In those years, I'd surely have been enthralled by this magical story.  It would have appealed to my little girl imagination.

As an adult, however, I felt too often bored by this movie.  I understand that it's meant to be a metaphor for the ties that bind, as well as for the energies and connections in our lives that are invisible, and yet, they influence us.  Even as a metaphor, however, the movie seemed far too predictable--but again, only for an adult, because for a child, it'd be just fine.  Due to the predictable story line, the pace was often slow.  As an adult, I wanted to learn more about the parents than I did, although their acting was fine.  So was the boy's.  (As for the one villain, it really was hard to let go of how I regard Robin Williams in order to believe him in this nasty role.  I'd have preferred the casting of someone easier to picture as a flat out user.)

For a child who would genuinely wonder as the movie went along, how it'd all turn out, the pace would be just fine.  A child would likewise not notice that the boy was not actually playing the music he allegedly performed (but for this adult, me-thinks that aspect of the movie could have been far better crafted).

Even if I regard this movie as a metaphor, I am not persuaded.  I was put off by the fact that this was a fairy tale, but its setting was current reality.  That fostered too much incoherence for me, because there was no explanation for the basis of the ""magic.'  Consequently, the movie never successfully got me to suspend my sense of reality.  (To illustrate what I mean by that, even as an adult, I enjoyed the Superman movie series, which also featured ""magic"" within a realistic setting.  It worked for me, however, because the basis for Superman's magic had been well-established--so I was easily able to enter into reality suspension from the outset.)

Again, if I were a child watching this, such incoherence wouldn't even show up on my radar.  I'd simply go with the magic implied--unconsciously identifying with it as the kind of magic which naturally exists inside any child's imagination.  All children ""know"" that their parents will find them again if they are lost.  All children can believe in fantasies where playing one's own music can make an upside world become right again.

If I had children 11 or under to whom I wanted to show a movie, I'd be glad to show them this one.  I think it's a fine little family-type story---nothing stupendous, but still some wholesome entertainment.  Like a few of us dissenters here, I am thoroughly surprised that so very many adults went wild over this movie.  Had I not paid a few dollars to rent it, I really doubt I'd have stuck with it all the way through.  As it was, I paused the movie at least twice to return my reading.  I did eventually see it through to the end, but the effort was laborious.",1448064000,,2973,4.4860335195530725

Life is full of strange unexplainable/coincidental moments so it didn't really seem too out there for me and is no more or less plausible than any other movie I've seen, spiritual faith and life in general. It centered around a specific location and beyond the family's psychic connection with each other and the boys ability to know where to find them, I didn't really have to stretch my imagination. No one flew, turned blue and time didn't shift. The writers/director fit as much as they could into this movie without making it hours long and the soundtrack was great. As for the little boy, musically gifted people and those that are not can have genius children. Some people can see music like that. I know a man that sees notes as specific colors, not to mention people with forms of autism who have photographic memory and artistic talent. More than half the people who've watched this like it, so I'm thinking it's just personal taste. If you've watched this and hated it that's fine. That's life. You've tried something new and it's time to get over it. Buying or renting this movie costs less than taking a gamble at a theater, so it's really not that devastating and is more a case of self important whining. I've thrown away a few movies in my time that people thought the world of but I've never tried to stop people from making up their own minds.",1444694400,,1387,4.596774193548387

3348596,5,B0013K7ZUE,"When mention the word----music, I think it is my whole world. I began to learn the violin when I was four years old. So, everything about music all appeals to me. And August Rush is just a movie, which has music as its theme throughout the whole story.

In my perspective, the movie is highly worth to see because it full of positive energy. It can bring hope to those children who live in the orphanage and dream to find their parents. Always having faith and confidence is one of the most significant things the movie taught us. Whats more, for some people who are interested in music, especially classic music, like me, this movie can make us have a further understanding about the magic power of music. Music exists everywhere. It has life, and can lead us to close our dream.

About twelve years ago, Lyla, a young beautiful cellist encountered a handsome man by following the music. The man named Louis is also a musician. They fell in love with each other in the first sight and had a wonderful night. However, their background is so different that Lyla's father forced them to break up. Lyla was pregnant after that night. But before the baby was born, she had an accident. In order not to affect her career, Lyras father sent the baby to an orphanage and told her he already died. From then on, Lyla and Louis never saw each other again, and both of them give up their music career. Many years later, the baby grew up. He is a cute boy, and very sensible to music. Every sound in this world can become a graceful melody in his ears. He is optimistic and has a faith that his parents must be waiting for him. Therefore, he left the orphanage, and began his long journey to looking for his parents.

In the whole movie, the plot that touched me most is when August playing the guitar with Louis in the corner of a street. The boy totally doesnt know the man in front of him is just his father. However, because of music., they meet each other, because of family tie that exist come with birth, they feel uncomfortable when its time to say goodbye. In my opinion, this part is very successful, since it compounds two most important themes of this movie. We can easily feel how much power the love of music and blood relationship has.

According to all above, I think this movie suits everyone regardless of children or adult. Therefor, watching it, and you will gain a lot!",1441065600,,2379,4.4495412844036695

Have watched a lot of great movies with very talented casts, but none have ever touched me as this has. This movie is a modern, semi- believable' fairy tale love story. I have watched it more than five times and each time I watch it I fall deeper in love with the characters and the story. My top five movies in order are, August Rush, Dances with wolves, Legends of the fall, The notebook and Second hand Lions. They all involve the power of love. John Wayne is my favorite actor and Elizabeth Taylor my favorite actress. August Rush will never be removed from my top spot. I sincerely bow to the people involved in the writing and production of this movie.",1440028800,,776,4.25

3348801,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Completely love this story. August is an adorable character. Jonathan is really good, and his and his son's music is fun to listen to. Robin was great and played that part well. Keri was emotionally flat and her being in love with Jonathan's character seems, well, forced or suppressed. Still it's a enjoyable rainy day movie if you don't want a lot of mushy.",1428710400,,359,4.625

3348808,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Freddie Highmore and Robin Williams combine for an interesting story where a young homeless boy holds onto hope that his parents will find him...all they have to do is hear his music.  Unbeknownst to him, his parents are both musicians - one a concert cellist and the other a singer in a ska band.  So the music courses through the young boy's veins.

Robin Williams skillfully plays a Fagin-like role as he leads/cares for/intimidates/profits from a group of homeless children in the city.

The music is mesmerizing, the story line is just believable enough to work, and the entire film is largely satisfying.

All in all a solid 4-star offering",1428192000,,646,4.836363636363636

3348810,2,B0013K7ZUE,"There is about 15 minutes worth of good movie, and that was at the end. The rest of it seems like a poorly organized, confusing attempt to take themes from an old Charles Dickens movie (Fagan, etc.) from Oliver Twist. Not worth the money and barely a 2 vs. 1. Not even good enough to give away, so we trashed it. The boy was good, as well as his Mother and Dad - the rest stunk.",1428192000,,378,3.986842105263158

3348853,4,B0013K7ZUE,"This movie is really awesome. I think it sends a good moral message about the beauty of life and the gift that children are. I really liked this film even though some parts of it I don't agree with (premarital sex for example), but what is interesting is that even though Lyla got pregnant, she decided to keep her child. Many people today would have told her to have an abortion or something but she kept it even though she did not have a father to raise her child with. This movie wonderfully shows the value and worth of the human person and that every child should have a chance to live. Later when Evan is grown up we as the audience are presented with a loveable character who is so gifted and talented with music, that we cant help but fall in love with his character. It is kind of sad however that such a talented and lovable kid is being raised in an orphanage when he deserves two parents who are committed in marriage. But this is seriously one of my favorite movies, its a feel good movie but at the same time it presents an accurate and realistic depiction of what happens in our society today, people don't want to have kids, people don't respect other human beings, etc, etc. This movie puts a personal character in our faces and helps us to see humanity and life for what it really is and how valuable and awesome it is to be human, and what a gift our lives are.",1425513600,,1380,4.270992366412214

Plot keeps you interested throughout the movie although parts of the story line just would not really happen in real life.

Robin Williams is barely mentioned in the cover/add but he has major role, somewhat as an antagonist and his character is kind of creepy.",1421280000,,423,4.5064935064935066

But the story, the determination, even the fears in life are spot on. My grandkids ages 5-10 not ready; maybe the 10 year old but will wait another year or 2.
So good to see Robin Williams again! A non-headlining role but always the perfect performance. Greatest lines from an obvious hard past life is his ""lecture"" to Julliard on music. Listen closely and fast. Perfect.
The kid, Freddie Highmore I think his name, have seen before The Sedgwick Chronicles and is simply GOOD in this. Why this movie did not get more of everything to get it out there is beyond me. Buy it.",1419465600,,738,4.556390977443609

3348978,3,B0013K7ZUE,"The unreality of music leading a kid to find parents he doesn't even know are alive initially made this movie too much of a stretch to take seriously.  Then we have all the musical improbabilities.  The first time the kid picks up a guitar, he starts playing a tapping, open tuned style.  But earlier we saw that same guitar tuned normally, so this would not have worked.  When Keri Russell ""plays the cello"", despite the quick edits, we can see she has no vibrato, and does not use the bow properly (except when they show someone else's hands doing it).  Jonathan Rhys Myers sings well, but his guitar chords look as if they were faked (I'm not sure about this one).  Then the kid is ""taught"" musical notation in twenty seconds by another kid, who says things like, see, it's f-a-c-e for the spaces, and e-g-b-d-f for the the lines.  How anyone who doesn't know music would have any understanding of that is bad enough, but the kid then starts writing notes on the paper, composing.  I thought he'd play the piano, but he has learned musical notation in 30 seconds.  He then starts playing the organ without ever being shown which notes on it correspond to the notes on paper.

Many people loved the music, but except for the Jonathan Rhys Myers songs, and the Kaki King guitar style, it was very unoriginal.  August's Rhapsody started with some Bach, and then included several other themes from classical and rock music.  To me it was very uninspiring, certainly nothing a young, cool musician would ever come up with.

But...despite all of this, the movie moved me at the end, and had me rooting for them all to get together, as I was overwhelmed (maybe manipulated) by the images and beauty of the ending.",1417305600,,1709,4.600660066006601

3349043,5,B0013K7ZUE,"On the surface, August Rush is a movie about a kid with amazing musical talents, in search of his parents who, due to tragic circumstances, don't know he exists. As a simple romance movie, it may seem to fall a little flat.

But August Rush is not meant to be a simple romance movie. For me, August Rush is a deeply spiritual movie about soul mates and the inter-connectedness between all things - living and non-living. The very first opening lines, spoken by the enchanting young star, Freddie Highmore, say, ""Listen. Can you hear it? The music. I can hear it everywhere. In the wind, in the air, in the light. It's all around us. All you have to do is open yourself up. All you have to do is listen."" This movie asks that of you. To really understand August Rush requires that you listen with your heart.

There are those that believe, spiritually, that God is actually everything. God is you, and me, and the flowers, trees, air, sky, etc. Scientists and mathematicians say that everything in our world - even the patterns in the air currents - can be expressed as a mathematical equation. There is even a theory now of the ""God Equation"". And of course, the connection between music and mathematics has long been studied by human beings. I believe that the creators of August Rush had all that in mind when they made this lovely movie.

Evan (Freddie Highmore) is an eleven year old boy, living at the Walden County Home For Boys - an orphanage. He doesn't fit in. His understanding of music and his unshakable belief that he can hear his parents out in the world set him apart from the other boys. They are jealous and intimidated by his faith and they lash out, calling him Freak. But Evan is undaunted, believing he gets the gift of hearing from his parents and that if he can learn to make the right music, they will hear him too.

His parents are Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), and Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). When they met, Lyla was an extraordinary cellist and Louis was the singer and lead guitarist in a rock band. They both heard the same music their son hears and they were drawn to each other in a soul mate kind of connection that led to one magical night of romance and passion (and the conception of their son).

When they awoke the next morning, they knew they were meant to be together forever. But when Lyla goes back to get her things, her father (William Sadler) comes down on her with an iron fist, stopping her from following her heart, and breaking Louis' when he sees them driving away. He leaves the band shortly after that - the music just hurts too much.

When Lyla turns out to be pregnant, her dad continues to convince her to stay for her own good. When Lyla wakes up from a frightening medical emergency that resulted in the birth of her child, her father tells her that the baby ""is gone"", leading her to believe it died. Lyla's heart is broken by the entire experience and she walks away from music, as well, becoming a teacher in Chicago.

Lyla and Louis never forget each other. They never stop sensing that something is missing from their lives. They don't know what it is, but they sense it, catching fleeting glimpses with their hearts.

Their son, however, believes completely. He runs away from the orphanage, determined to learn how to express his own music while listening for his parents to guide his journey. As all three of them open their hearts, they are drawn ever closer on an amazing journey of faith, beauty, and music that shows the patterns of inter-connectedness between the three of them (and around us all.)

I absolutely adore this movie. As a musical person and a spiritual person, August Rush speaks to me on multiple levels. I find it a joy to watch, no matter how many times I see it.

Watching the interweaving of circumstances and characters, the near misses they experience and the ways that they interact without even realizing they are doing it, moves me. I watch and I think about the patterns in my own life and the way things have worked out in seemingly mysterious ways at times. This movie makes me feel more connected to the magic all around me.

The cast is truly enjoyable. I am so impressed with Freddie Highmore. He comes across as an old soul in a young body, wise beyond his years and unafraid to believe. Terrance Howard is Richard Jeffries, the caseworker that teaches Evan to whistle and seems to be the first person who sees how special he is.

The late, great Robin Williams is Wizard - a ""broken elf"" kind of person who is an intriguing combination of light and dark. He clearly knows music, describing it to Evan as, ""God's little reminder that there's something else besides us in this universe, a harmonic connection between all living beings, everywhere, even the stars."" He is drawn to Evan because he sees that Evan knows the music too. Wizard's music was there the night that Lyla and Louis met and his influence brings Evan ever closer to his parents, even if that is not his conscious intention.

Jamia Simone Nash is Hope, an absolutely adorable girl that not only steals every scene she is in, she leads Evan to Reverand James (Mykelti Williamson). Mykelti has been a personal favorite of mine since seeing him as ""Bubba"" in Forrest Gump, and he is lovely in his small part as someone who cares deeply about Evan and his gifts, ultimately helping him to get into Julliard.

If you are a fan of music, you will certainly enjoy this movie on that level alone. But if you open up to it and listen with your heart, you just might love it the way I do.

It's a beautiful story about a boy who believes that if he plays music loud enough, his parents will find him. Its beautiful. I watched AI and Forrest Gump shortly before watching this movie; so far August Rush is the best out of all of those. It has a beautiful message that August says at the very beginning and very end of the movie, ""Music is all around us. All you have to do is listen."" This is basically the lesson of the story; its a beautiful lesson. The music is the most beautiful music Ive ever heard, especially August's symphony that closes the movie.

This music is good, the acting, well Robin Williams, I think was trying to look like Bono, and I am assuming that he was supposed to be a Fagin like Dickinson character and I that was done fairly well.

The end of the movie is very inspirational! Also, it has some famous actors in it, which was surprising. NOTE: ROBIN WILLIAMS PLAYED A BAD GUY IN THE FILM, BUT DID AN EXCELLENT JOB! THE MOST GIFTED PEOPLE SOMETIMES HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS IN LIFE. HE WILL BE MISSED ALONG WITH OTHER ENTERTAINERS FROM THE PAST AND THE DECENT YOUNG ONES. I AM NOT INTO THE LATEST TV SHOWS AND MOVIES AND IF I WATCH ONE, IT HAS TO BE RATED G, PG AND MAYBE A FEW PG-13. I AM FINDING THAT THE COMMERCIALS ARE THE MOST ANNOYING WITH DRUGS, GUNS AND SEX. I HOPE SOMEONE PUTS OUT A BLOCKER FOR THEM!!! AND ""THEY"" WONDER WHY THIS IS A VIOLENT AND SEX-CRAZED COUNTRY!

3349374,5,B0013K7ZUE,"It is entertainment, not a music documentary. As such it was very enjoyable. If you enjoy music, familial situations and unusual friendships you may enjoy this.

A couple of the relationships between the characters are not as simple as they may initially seem. And one in particular that might appear to be one of ""taking advantage of"" needs to be looked at from all angles to see that it may be more symbiotic than you think at first.

I cannot really say more without possibly spoiling it, so let me sum up:

3349384,4,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is a little cheesy, but such fun to watch.  Freddy Highmore is perfect in his role as a orphan (with a gift for hearing music in the world around him) on the loose in NYC searching for his parents. Robin Williams is oh-so believable as the less-than-honorable street musician who tries to exploit August's talent.  The story is a contrived and unbelievable - but if you view it as a fairy tale it's an highly entertaining film for adults as well as kids and may open up lots of interesting conversations.",1396828800,,516,4.537634408602151

The character is so rich with wisdom, feelings and authenticity. Any obstacle that stands in his way, he pushes through and not by force, more by a flowing reality that everything will be exactly as it should be.

It is a beautiful tale of true love, coming of age and of course, musical talent. No one could walk away from this film without a smile.

Feels like the film ""Oliver"" to some extent, but more modern, less cloak/dagger and an inspiring love story weaved in such a way that inspires you to ""believe"" is that special something we all want to know is out there guiding our lives.

Great film, great for kids to watch (age 10+ kind of thing)

I was inspired to pick up a guitar and play a bit after this film.  I have like ""zero"" musical talent - but I discovered - maybe that assumption I've had most of my life is in error.",1395705600,,597,4.076923076923077

The movie truly is art in every sense of the word (the acting, the writing, the music, the filming, etc.). The only thing that I didn't like was that the whole thing is based on (small spoiler alert) the result of a hook up between two people which happens at the very beginning of the movie. I mean, seriously, if you met the man/woman of your dreams with whom you had so much in common on an emotional level, wouldn't you spend the night getting to know one another by talking rather than having unprotected sex on a roof? Call me conservative, and I know that the whole story line would be different, but I work with high schoolers and didn't like the wreck less message that this part of the story conveyed.",1395014400,,811,4.377483443708609

3349478,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Music is my first love. It follows me everywhere I go, and I willingly let it. But most of the time, I am the one doing the following.

There is something about August Rush that I completely connected with. There is so much heart and soul in this film, that I become an emotional wreck ever time I watch it.

Freddie Highmore is so great! I have watched just about everything he has played in, and he continues to get better. I originally watched this movie because of Johnathan Rhys Meyers, because..well, do I really need an explanation. His voice is so, so incredibly sexy. And Robin Williams is beyond creepy in this part.

Anyways, the thought that music binds this entire family is beautiful. The way it all comes together in the end is spectacular. Again, I am an emotional wreck by the ending credits.

If you haven't seen August Rush yet, do it.",1389830400,,854,4.490322580645161

His family is also very musical. Big fan of his, he plays an awesome ""Valentine"" in ""City of Bones"".  The little boy, Freddie Highmore, Evan Taylor/August Rush does an excellent job acting in this film, as well as Keri Russell.  It is so happy when he is conducting his Rhapsody and at the end he knows he has played the music that brought his parents together and to him.  Robin Williams plays the Dark ""Olympic"" very well-I don't like it when he plays the bad guy.

I Love how they incorporated the sounds of nature and noise of the city for August to be able to put it into music!!!!  I love this movie mostly because of the music and how they show how this lonely young boy used these sounds to create such magnificent music!!!!! It was his peace, enjoyment, and the driving forces that he felt would lead him to his parents!!!!
 So Beautiful, Heartwarming, movie!!!!! The only thing I did not like is when the leader [for the homeless children ] swore!  I felt the producers did not have to add that language into this movie!  But it does show the reality of what runaways may have to endure if they make that choice to runaway, and hopefully this movie can not only uplift such Beautiful Music, but show young people, that running away is not the right choice, because even though in this movie it had a excellent ending, but in reality it does not work out in such good endings!!!!  I was very glad that that through the sounds he heard, he translated it to the most beautiful  music!!!! And I Loved how they used the music he created to find his parents who both  themselves loved music even it was different kind of music for the father!!!  This Is A Must own DVD or CD!!!!! I have not heard the CD yet, it is on it's way to my home as well as the DVD, and I FEEL THE DVD IS A EXCELLENT MOVIE [EXCEPT for the  1 or 2 swear words[s] I can not remember] it shows the reality of can happen to young people who run away! And it also shows a good ending for a very talented boy looking for his parents, and his parents looking for him!!!!  But If Nothing else would touch your heart for this movie,... the music will , and you would want to hear it over and over again!!!1  Thank You for letting me speak on this movie!!!",1388534400,,1890,4.202216066481994

Jonathan and Keri have gone on to THE TUDORS and THE AMERICANS but are wonderful as cellist and singer.

Some critics miss the point, entirely. Actually, it may be more reality, than fantasy. Sometimes, people do reunite in what seem like a miracle situation. You have to open your mind. I just loved everything about the movie. The acting was good, but not overdone.  People just want to see a nice movie with people who persevere, even though as Freddie says "" They try & take away, the music"", & the desire to find, his parents. From the beginning you can tell all 3, of them know there is something missing, & strive to find, the answer. It seems most movies these days , have no ending, or you're disappointed,in the ending.

GREAT music though!",1384473600,,333,5.403846153846154

3349569,1,B0013K7ZUE,"We have wanted to see this movie for years.  We are a musically talented family and appreciate many genres of music.  We were looking so forward to soaking the movie in through all things instrumental.  We were ready to be dazzled.  We were sorely and sadly disappointed.

Each of the main actors had about two facial expressions through the entire movie.  It felt like watching a sub-par high school play.  To add to the bad acting, Robin Williams was cast as the arch nemesis and played the same exact role he has played in a dozen other movies (Robin Williams as himself?).  Ugh.  I am annoyed when people talk during a movie, but you could not help it with this one...there were so many funny things to comment on...and it is not a comedy.

Everything about this movie seemed contrived, forced, unbelievable and downright silly.  There could be a web-site devoted to all the plot inconsistencies that ran throughout.

On the plus side, the soundtrack was great.",1377907200,,965,4.712574850299402
3349570,5,B0013K7ZUE,It's a beautiful story that our family truly enjoyed. I initially purchased it for my 9yr old son who is a guitar player. I wanted him to feel inspired by how well this young man plays. He was inspired. And he loved the story. Mission accomplished.,1377561600,,248,4.413043478260869

3349576,5,B0013K7ZUE,"As a church organist I especially love the scene where August Rush discovered the pipe organ and explored the stops/pedal board and then the light came in through the stained glass windows -- this is exactly how I felt when I was young and discovering the instrument for myself.  As a member of a local orchestra I appreciate the classical aspects with the cellist/mother and as a woman who cannot do housecleaning with some rock n roll going in the background I like how the father/rocker finds a niche in everything around him.  Robin Williams acted his self-centered part well and it was fun to watch all the musical talent culminate.  If you listen there is music all around you -- that is no lie, and this film helps wake that feeling.  Yes, it is clich&eacute;d, but what can you do with 2 hours to weave a story?  This film does it about as best as it can be done.",1376870400,,871,4.41875

Wrong side of the tracks meets sophisticated cello player...(one caution is the immediate sleeping together but no nudity or sexual act involved.  Some cursing).

Robin Williams successfully plays the street hustler you want to like and hate at the same time.  Good acting, good storyline, great music, I think all will thoroughly enjoy.",1374019200,,543,5.056179775280899

As the movie progresses, you begin to hear August's music...the rhythm of life.  This movie captured me.  I rented it twice; shared it with a couple of other people that I know like music and finally bought it because I wanted to see it again and knew it belonged in my library of movies I like over and over again.

I'm not going to tell the story.  The story is good and it makes you want to dream again of good things.  Hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.",1372550400,,709,4.079710144927536

3349612,5,B0013K7ZUE,"From the trailers I thought this movie was solely about a boy searching for his biological parents, and using music to find them.  I was sorely mistaken, and am very glad that a friend recommended this film to me.  It has the depth you want in a great love story, but seldom find in most modern pictures.  I only wish the writers (or perhaps director?) had focused more efforts on the varying types of love capable within a family - you'll see what I mean - rather than introduce an outside business ""family"" structure as well.  But then again, maybe the contrast of the two adds to one's grasp of the familial love.  Either way, a true joy to watch as a family and as a couple.  Loved it.",1372032000,,689,4.3023255813953485

3349618,1,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush should come with a warning: you may contract diabetes from watching this movie. What a load of romantic cliches and completely irrational crap! Movies like this perpetuate the myth that a one night stand whom you never see again is really your One True Love and if you find each other again, it will be happily ever after all the way. Yeah, right. I'd like to see this couple in five years when her habit of alphabetizing the canned goods is driving him nuts, and his leaving the toilet seat up is making her crazy.

Leave your common sense at the door if your going to watch this, because you'll be asked to believe that a healthy white male baby wouldn't immediately be fought over by multiple families who want to adopt him, but would instead be placed in some mythical home for orphan boys, which hasn't existed since Oliver Twist, that a hospital system would allow a child to be given up by the mother with just a signature, and not a lengthy conversation about why she doesn't want to keep her baby, and that a grown crazy man is housing multiple street urchins who stay with him voluntarily. You'll also be asked to believe (spoiler alert - as if anyone with more than two brain cells can't figure it out from the beginning) that two people who met once will find each other, and their long-lost son eleven years later in a city of millions of people without much trouble at all. The breathless dialog and faux angst between and among characters is nauseating.

I kept looking for it to play again so I could DVR it, but it was never re-run again that I could find.  So I bought the DVD.  the music is excellent, the story, like August believes, is a fairy tale about music bringing people together.  Robin Williams is always a treat in movies like this, very talented, but not a scene stealer, he just makes all of the characters shine with him.  I recently got my first Big Screen HD TV with surround sound installed in my bedroom, so I just bought the Blue-Ray version and the Soundtrack on CD with free digital download. They both rock on my system, I'll probably have to get another copy of the Blue-Ray because I could watch it over and over again!  Just be sure to have a box of tissues handy.  It's just one of those little sleeper movies that grabs you and never lets go!  Go get it, you won't be sorry (just don't tell anyone that you don't want to know that you actually do have a heart find out!)",1367625600,,1046,4.113300492610837
3349651,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I watched August Rush for the first time on a Sunday late-afternoon while flicking through TV channels. Of course, I didn't caught it from the beginning, and that happened every time since, whenever I found it on TV. I decided to purchase the DVD, not only because I wanted to watch it in its entirety for once and for all but also because it had always touched me from the middle onwards, which was always the part caught by me.

Evan's life-journey, with the music inside him leading the way, had kind of a sad and beautiful impact on me. Another thing that allowed watching the movie from the beginning is that I was finally able to understand all the musical connections between Lyla, Louis and August. You could say that not being able to caught a movie right from the start takes some of its magic away. But in this case it was the opposite, because every time I became aware of a harmonic blending between two different performances or theme that eventually becomes part of August's Rhapsody, I couldn't help but cheering those special moments.

August Rush is a great movie all by itself. But being a musician and music lover too I felt the experience to be much greater than watching any other movie that has a complete different topic. So I recommend this DVD to anybody who'd like to witness a fairy-tale story and be soared by touching melodies.",1367539200,,1357,4.580246913580247

But then we come to the part where the kid finds this old guitar in the attic or something and immediately starts playing like Kaki King.  That's where I lost it. There is just no way this is going to happen no matter how much innate talent the kid has.  Kaki King plays her unique style on a finely tuned, custom-made instrument.  Nobody is going to pick up an old guitar and immediately sound like this.  Anyone who could believe this knows absolutely nothing about music.  There is just no way.

3349662,3,B0013K7ZUE,"Loosely based on Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, this family-friendly film tells the story of a young boy, Evan Taylor, who has grown up in an orphanage without knowing his parents. After running away from the orphanage, Evan, played by Freddie Highmore, changes his name to August Rush and begins a stint as a street musician working for a modern day Fagan named Wizard, played by Robin Williams. We are supposed to believe that Evan, now August, has an innate musical genius that allows him to hear music in the air and to pick up a guitar and immediately start playing it. He also teaches himself to read and compose musical scores in the space of an afternoon. On the basis of his musical genius, he is soon accepted into Juilliard as a twelve year old and  is asked to headline an outdoor orchestral concert in Central park. If you know the plot of Oliver twist, you can guess the outcome of this movie, as invisible forces move the characters toward its inevitable conclusion.
On the plus side, the movie is about the power of music, and features several heartfelt performances by Evan's father, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and by his mother, played by the beautiful Keri Russell. Victorius's own Leon Thomas provides support in the role of Arthur, the August Rush equivalent of The Artful Dodger. Although hopelessly sentimental, August Rush is the most derivative, uninspired, unbelievable, predictable movie that will ever love.",1366243200,,1440,4.901639344262295

3349688,3,B0013K7ZUE,"Let me be up front right now.  This movie is more about faith and music connecting everybody than anything.  The story begins with Keri Russel and Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing Lyla and Louis, 2 individuals involved in music in different ways.  Lyla is with the philharmonic and Louis is in a band.  They meet one night, have a deep connection and then Lyla is forced away by her father.  Lyla becomes pregnant and ends up in an accident.  Her father tells her the baby died, but we then turn to the baby turned into an 11 year old at a boys home.  The story then becomes about Evan (August Rush) and his journey throughout New York in order to play his music to find his parents.  There are some really great moments in the movie, but you have to be able to put doubt about Lyla hearing Evan's symphony and knowing that is her son aside and just enjoy the movie.",1361836800,,862,4.3105590062111805

This sweet story has been superbly directed and edited to build tension with a lovely climax that leaves you wanting more. Appropriate for the entire family as an encouragement to reach for the stars in expressing your talent - very young audiences won't get as much from it and kids just entering the teen years need to be able to discuss some aspects with their parents, but overall, a lovely film about finding love and expressive the gifts you've been given.",1361750400,,559,4.77319587628866

Don't even need to play a note, but just to be appreciative of musical talent when you hear it. great direction and acting as well. the film may be a few years old now, but it's a nice, clean film to watch without the constant expletives and violence that plague so many films, even academy award nominees.",1359936000,,612,4.230769230769231

It is a fairy tale--even as a prodigy, what August accomplishes requires a huge suspension of disbelief, but it's a beautiful story wrapped around a wonderful synthesis of musical styles.  It's a story of how music can affect us if we let it, how music can bring us together if we allow it to do so.  August's journey back to his parents is a lovely parable of the importance of passion in our lives, and the willingness to continue a journey even when things look their bleakest.

The parents become separated by twists of fate but in his heart he believes he actually hears the music of his parents calling out to him and pursues that feeling.

The film is charming and pulls on the heartstrings of the viewer. It's directed to your inner child. Plausibility doesn't come into play but rather we are encouraged to surrender to pure fantasy. We are also provided with an ""escape from realism"" that brings us down. It raises our spirits, giving us an emotional boost that most of us can benefit from.

All three of these actors were perfectly suited for their parts Freddie Highmore (""August"") Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Louis"") and Keri Russell (""Lyla""). Supporting actors, including Robin Williams, give very good performances as well. The music is incredible.

Will most definitely be on my favorite list. Have watched it repeatedly....LOVED IT!! every time. Even purchased the music which I rarely ever do.

In that sense it seemed reasonable to me that August ""heard"" his mother and father calling to him with music while he was living in an orphanage never having known his musician parents. Music connected them even when hopelessly separated and music brought them together in the end, proving more powerful than the greed and ambition that is in the world.

I have two children that are music majors with degrees from college and are now music teachers. This movie is about the love for music and what music means to many people. It is a fairy tale, and quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. If you love music you will love this movie.  Signed, moved to tears!  P.S.

Not all children given away turn out with such luck to find both of the parents who are still in love with each other after such seperation.  I love the way music is interperated.  Like the foreign film ""Beyond Silence"", this is my favorite children film.  Nowaday, children are so spoiled that they have no idea how their lives could possibly without their loving parents.  Many adults grow up also with the hurting child inside from the divorced or death of their parents.  This movie is very healing.  I am saving it for my mother, my boyfriend to watch.

3349812,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Louis Connelly, an Irish musician burned out on music and Lyla Novacek, a professional cellist, share a chance magical evening. The result is a child who the father does not know exists and the mother believes died stillborn in a car accident. In reality, the child was put up for adoption by the mother's controlling father. Now, years later, the boy August Rush is searching for parents that do not even know he exists. August, a musical prodigy who can hear music in the random sounds of everyday life, is convinced he can use his remarkable musical talent to reunite himself with the parents he has never known. He has a chance encounter with his father (neither knows who the other is) and both play guitars in a scene reminiscent of ""Dueling Banjos"" in Deliverance. In the latter half of the movie, the mother finds out from her father that her baby did not die in the car accident and she goes looking for him. But how can mother and son be reunited when neither knows the others name or location? Love of music will draw the father, the mother and the lost son together in one magical moment in space and time.

Yes, the movie is unrealistic. Yes, it has fairy tale elements. Yes, it is a combination of Oliver Twist (young orphan travels to London and meets the Artful Dodger, leader of a gang of pickpockets) and Harry Potter (young wizard orphan in search of knowledge about his dead parents). But the movie works to pull you in. The musical scenes are magical. This is a feel good movie with a happy ending.

A rollicking wreck of a script with a scary kid who might work well in a ""Friday the 13th"" movie. What's most irritating about it is that it tries so hard to be inspirational but the story about a kid with such ""talent"" that he can just pick up the guitar for the first time and play it masterfully or compose a complicated symphony that gets a huge production in NYC focusses on the glory of natural (read ""unnatural"") talents. Give me a story about someone who struggles against all odds, practicing and studying and working hard to be the best they can be. That would be inspirational.

The acting and music are very good.  The blending of diverse styles of music when the rock concert and the classical cello were playing together ties in with a universal language theme running through the movie.

3349825,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Now for starters, this film is very hyphy. When investors ""Keak Tha Sneak"" and ""Kool Keith"" decided to executive produce a film about music lovers, they had no idea what they were getting into. Apparently this was supposed to be a monumental film on the scale of ""Citizen Cane"" meets ""Transformers the Movie"" starring Kevin Spacey as a ten-year old orphan who discovers the magic power of death metal while being August Rushed in a cornfield. However, Spacey stepped out at the last moment to film ""Pay It Forward 2: Electric Boogaloo."" So instead we got this film about an actual orphan who directs wheat, to see how much it will yield. After meeting the pimp from ""Hustle and Flow,"" the young prodigy leaves and wanders into the woods, where he mistakes a wolf for a cello. Upon reaching the big apple, he meets Garp, who teaches him how to play acoustic versions of Tool songs on a wolf. I can't really recommend higher than five stars, because they won't allow me, but the score by Cannibal Corpse (working with famed rapper First Degree The D.E.) really boosts this film into a level of transcendence rarely seen in this era of big-budget blockbusters with no soul. The film is also filled out by U2 singer ""Bono"" who plays the young man's father. Pay it forward indeed.",1308528000,,1275,4.646017699115045

3349827,2,B0013K7ZUE,"I was excited to see this film because I love fairy tales and those types of stories. This isn't really one. And compared to something truly wonderful like Pans Labrynth it's pedestrian and cliched.

I can't actually believe how many good reviews it got, which just goes to show that one mans meet is another mans poison! I found it very sickly and just too cloying for my tastes.

The cast were great however (waste of a great cast IMO) - well except for Robin Williams who over acted commendably. Jonathon Rhys Myers was good and the child actor was amazing. Just a pity they had such a weak story to work with.

If you fancy checking it out though i would say to do so, it;s not an offensive film and obviously a lot of people really love it.

Oh and it has Alex O'Loughlin in it for about all of three minutes but he steals the damn film with those minutes and he's very, very, very pretty here. So yeah two stars for Alex. It would have been one otherwise!",1308096000,,961,4.263736263736264

3349829,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is an eleven year old boy living in an orphanage. He has never known or met either of his parents, yet he has known most of his life that he was not supposed to be orphaned and both of his parents wanted him. He can hear things all around him, in musical tones whether it be words, wind chimes, the sound of honking horns or birds chirping, it all has a musical resonance to him. The kid is a profound musical prodigy waiting to develop. Although he has never played a musical instrument, the music is inside of him. His belief that his parents are out there somewhere and love him, as well as the music he feels his parents somehow gave to him, drives Evan to run away from the orphanage in search of them. What he finds is much more than he imagined was hiding inside of him all along.

There he meets a con artist whose street name is ""Wizard"" (Robin Williams), who once a prodigy like himself shares his ability to hear music in everything around him. Evan chances upon a guitar and masterfully begins to play as his natural talent becomes quite evident. ""Wizard"" changes Evan's name to ""August Rush"", partly to promote the boy's talent, and partly to disguise him as he learns Evan is a runaway and there is a search being conducted to find him. Through a course of events, the two are seperated and Evan (now ""August"") hides out in a church orphanage where his talent is quickly discovered and he is soon enrolled at Juliard School of Music where he composes a masterpiece the school solicits the New York Symphony Orchestra to perform.

Evan's parents were Lyla Novacek (Keli Russell) who at the time was an accomplished Cellist with the New York Symphony, and Louis Conelly (the very talented Jonathan Rhys Meyers) an Irish singer and songwriter, who met on one magical night in New York and fell deeply in love with each other. Due to horrible circumstances the two never met again. Both talented musicians left their field of music and pursued other avenues of life. One in San Francisco, the other in Chicago, far from the child neither one knows even exists. Can the faith that drives a child who thinks he can hear his parents through the music they gave him, possibly compose a reconnection of these three lives?

This movie is fantasy, and oftentimes throughout, it suffers moments of great lack of reality, nevertheless by then the viewers attention is captured in the awe of it's magic, and reality is no longer expected. The film is charming and pulls on the heart of the viewer to let go and believe in fairy tales. The music in this film is incredible. Highmore (""August"") gives a stellar performance of his character and steals the show completely. Not far behind him is the performance of Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Louis"") and Keli Russell (""Lyla""). All three of these actors were perfectly suited for the part in which they were cast, performing with incredible feeling and unique talent. The well orchestrated cast of supporting actors, including Robin Williams, give very good performances of their characters as well, bringing the script together in perfect harmony.

The DVD offers a scene selection feature as well as a few additional scenes which were edited out of the production. Most of these scenes fit perfectly into the script and a couple of them would have been helpful in their original place. The only negative I can give this film is that the ending was rather disappointing. It builds up for 113 minutes and just as the viewer is expecting to see the end result of a masterful script, the movie ends abruptly. The rest is left to your own imagination. Although it was all spelled out, and the right characters were in place for the moment they belonged in, the film does not deliver the visual crescendo the viewer is longing for. The audience is left screaming for an encore that is never given. I suppose the point was for the viewer to hear the music within themselves, nevertheless it would have been much more satisfying to have actually SEEN it!

A young orphan boy tries to find his parents. He ends up lost/homeless on the street. He is taken in by a pied-piper of young street musicians, who lives in a run down abandoned building. His parents had a love-at-1st-sight experience, but were pulled in different directions. I won't give the storyline away, but his mom didn't know he was alive. His dad never knew he existed. The boy knew that his mom and dad loved him and were trying to find him. He felt the only way he could find them was to create music so that they could hear it...and then they would find him.

I really appreciate how this movie takes you through several different levels of art/music: amateur, sophisticated,  orchestra, rock, blues, self-taught, refined, gritty street, gospel, etc.

In addition to what I thought were generally extremely limited acting skills, he displayed virtually no change of emotion throughout the entire movie, for which I blame the director. Being upbeat and hopeful are nice virtues to be sure, but this was ridiculous. And what kid, who is supposedly a musical prodigy no less, in his right mind would trade a free Julliard education to go back with Wizard? That was a patently stupid contrivance apparently used solely to extend the running time and ramp up the tension for the even sillier contrivance that brings them all together. Speaking of Julliard, do they routinely enroll homeless orphans who possess no identifying paperwork at all? Is that even legal?  Were they appointed his legal guardian by some competent authority or did they just assume the role on their own? Not one character in this movie came across as resembling a real human being in my opinion.

3349840,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I have read some 1 star reviews saying this is in no way a 5 star movie. These reviewers, if you read them are obviously music teachers or musicians that are the epitome of the bully in the orphanage. They have issues and can't accept that it's a movie and is fantasy. It is not based off real people. These people would try to force anyone with talent better than themselves to deny that talent out of jealousy. Fine, it is very exagerated that our boy can pick up sheet music and just know how to read it and compose a song in less than 1 day but like I said. It's a movie.
On to the review:
I love this movie. I am not going to start flashing names of artists they were copying for Freddie Highmore's style of playing but there are originators of it out there for longer than you think.
As we begin, we have Evan - Aka August Rush (Freddie Highmore) in an orphanage and he is bullied for being different. Flash to 11 yrs earlier to Keri Russell (Celebrated Julliard celloist) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (budding Rock star) meeting and having a one night stand. Keri is controlled by her father William Sadler so the relationship doesn't take off.
Back to Evan in the present - He leaves to find his parents by ""following"" the music.
Terence Howard is the child services rep trying to find him.
Robin Williams is the person who takes him in which is the ""Oliver Twist"" part. He gives Evan the name August Rush as a stage name but also to hide him from the authorities in order to use his talents. Not his best work but the character was not supposed to be outright violent or dangerous. He is a guy that you just don't know how off his rocker he is or how violent he COULD be.
The rest of the movie is a show of the close calls of the father, mother and Evan coming so close to meeting it will make you almost cry. You spend the movie beginning to believe that as long as Evan is playing, his mother and father will find him.
If you have no hope, don't watch it. Or, better yet, you should be watching it.",1297728000,,2005,4.196891191709844

3349843,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I could only say ""wow"" after seeing this film. August Rush is a highly beautiful film about a boy living in an orphanage. He absolutely adores everything that has to do with music and this passion of his takes him on a quest for the two aspects he misses the most in life: his parents and a fair chance to play and enjoy music. As for the acting, the sweet and sincere leading character gives an amazing performance. Still, it's the high quality melodies that make this movie really stand apart.

The following sentence heard in the film sums up it's main message: ""Just listen!"" This is a great piece of advice for everyone living in our stressed up world today. How often do we ignore or neglect all the gentle voices around us: the singing of birds, the sounds of wind and the expressed honest hopes and expectations of the people around us.",1294444800,,844,4.48051948051948

3349845,1,B0013K7ZUE,"This is a review of the movie--not the DVD.

I first want to comment how astounding it is that the audience ""Fresh"" rating on Rottentomatoes.com for this movie is over 80%, whereas the critics have provided less than 35% positive reviews.  This is one where the audience needs to pull its head out of its rear and realize that a cute kid, a pretty actress, Robin Williams, and the IDEA of a good story do not a good movie make.

The concept of a wanted-but-lost child who is a musical prodigy searching for his parents, and entering into said concept as the audience with the faint promise of a happy ending, is all more than okay with me.  The problems I have is how much farther the movie demands I stretch the license I give it to ignore reality.  I'll buy that this kid can ""hear"" his parents, that he's the most gifted musical prodigy to have ever been born, that his grandfather is a mean and selfish man to the point of secretly giving the kid up for adoption, that somehow two people know they're ""meant for each other"" after a one-night-stand, and even (spoiler alert) that the boy can turn around at the end of his concert and see his parents and immediately know who they are.

I will not, however, buy that he can sight-read sheet music after a 7-year-old girl shows him what a quarter note is, or that an inner-city pastor can walk a kid through the front doors of Juilliard and get him enrolled in classes, or that such a young boy would be allowed to participate in such a high-profile concert when no one even knows who his parents are.  Also unforgiveable is the editing during the musical scenes, where the camera doesn't stop panning.  It's unforgiveable because 1) it's irritating, and 2) it's quickly obvious that the purpose is to try to distract you from the fact that the filmmakers couldn't be troubled to hire a very good musical consultant.  If you're a guitarist like me, or really any kind of musician, watching Evan and others ""play"" guitar is painful.  You hear solo parts when all the actors are doing is strumming, or hear the guitarist slide up on the neck and the actors move down, if at all.  Then there's the part when Evan touches a piano for the first time--it's clear as day that it's the wrong note.  And this isn't a perfect pitch kind of thing--the kid was not even at the right octave.  How is it that someone decides to make a movie that is built around music but can't be bothered to make it appear that the instruments are actually being played?

Like I said, the concept of the movie sounds beautiful, but its execution is gut-wrenching.",1291248000,,2585,4.472340425531915

3349849,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Loosely based on Dickins' ""Oliver Twist,"" Freddie Highmore plays a young boy lost in New York's childcare system, searching for his parents, who gave him up.  He runs away from the boys' home he grew up in, abused by the other kids, not the adults, who genuinely care for him.

Highmore has a gift of music, inherited from both his parents, and is quickly picked up by a Fagan like character played by Robin Williams, who sends kids out into Washington Square Park playing music for money.

Meanwhile, the boy's mother finds out that her son is still alive (she was lied to by her father, who forged her signature on the papers, giving him up.)  How the doctors and hospital went along with this is never explained, but the mother gives a decent performance, yelling at her father on his deathbed, ""Where is he?""  She goes to see child care services, who after running her through red-tape, finally help her try to track down her missing son.

Williams learns the state is looking for ""Evan"", and changes the boy's name to ""August Rush,"" a stage name.  The boy is quickly discovered by a priest who takes him to Juliard, and the boy is revealed to be a musical prodigy.

The tale follows Oliver Twist; Williams reclaims the boy from the school, claiming to be his father.  In the park, Freddie meets his real father, who convinces him to go to the planned concert anyway.  There, both parents are called by their son's music, and the mother recognizes him on stage from his photograph.

3349863,5,B0013K7ZUE,"The parallels between this movie and Oliver, which have been pointed out by other reviewers, in no way detracts from the charm of this movie. The story of a young boy who has been left to his own resources, and discovers a haven called music is inspiring and dramatic; I can most specifically relate to using music has a source of hope and promise as a boy!

The story proceeds with a series of flashbacks that explain how the situation developed that put our talented hero in an orphanage. His love of music, which was strictly generated within him, serves as a focal point for living that helps compensate for the difficulties which life has placed before him.

August is blessed with a remarkable talent for music that places him in the child prodigy category. Having no one that cares enough to help him, he must find music in all that surrounds him; as he listens to the ordinary sounds of life he translates that into music in his mind.

A basic part of his belief system is a complete, unshakable confidence that his parents love him and want him back. This notion is ridiculed by the other boys in the orphanage but his confidence is not compromised by that.

The story takes a big turn when August, who is actually named Evan Taylor, decides to follow the music and finds himself in the totally strange surroundings of New York City. This is where a boy street musician, the ""Artful Dodger"" character, befriends him and takes him to meet the ""Fagin"" character who in this story is called The Wizard, very well played by Robin Williams.

The pace of the story picks up from this point onward; the lives of all three, the mother, Lyla, played by Keri Russell, the father, Louis, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the son, August/Evan, played by Freddie Highmore are being drawn together by their shared love of music. I will only say that the ending does not disappoint!

The copy we watched last night was loaned to us by a friend; I placed an order for a copy of our own this morning with Amazon. I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. By the way, the sound on the disc is very good; there are instrumental solos including a pipe organ that sound fabulous, as well as an unusual blending of rock and classical music used to show the dramatically different lives lead by Lyla and Louis.

3349865,5,B0013K7ZUE,I watched this movie on cable and only saw apart of it but when it came on again it was kind of late and I had to get up early for work but it was well worth watching the parts I missed the first time. I'm not an expert critic or even a musician but this movie kept my attention and I found it to be just a good movie for all ages to watch. I know its not all real but I guess just allowing my imagination to flow with the movie and with the characters in the movie I found it to be entertaining and well worth owning and watching over and over again. Too bad for those that are so serious about their music that found this movie offensive and unbelievable.  I'm not one of them I just liked the movie and the music no mater how not real some parts may have been thats the beauty of it for me.

3349868,5,B0013K7ZUE,"First I have to say I LOVE this movie.  I am somewhat cynical and rough around the edges, but this movie got to me.  ""August Rush"" is lovely fairy tale about a little boy, Evan Taylor, who has grown up in a state home, who is a musical prodigy.  Unbeknownst to him, he is the son of two musically gifted parents (played by the wonderful Kerri Russell and the brilliant Jonathan Rhys-Myers.  Evan is convinced he is still loved and wanted by his parents, and rightfully, as his mom was tricked into giving him up by her duplicitous father.  We meet the young lovers who connect on a rooftop, discussing music and the connection it is in their lives, only to be spearated.  Evan is sent away, his mother thinking he died in her emergency delivery.  Evan think he can reach them through music and he hears music in the most mundane of sounds.  The opening is a bluray delight(between image and audio) with Evan ""conducting"" the wheat colored fields of his orphanage as the wind pours through it.  He runs away one night to find his parent, convinced if he can play his music where it can be heard they will find him.  He meets a street grifter (a wonderfully dispicable Robin Williams) who tries to exploit his gifts to line his pockets and even gives him the stage name of August Rush.

The movie relies on a lot of coincidences and leaps in credibility, but the fairy tale tenor of the story makes this permissible as we feel we are watching a fable, but the genius of the movie is the realistic look and feel of the film and characters.  Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) is brilliant.  The film is set on his shoulders and he delivers.  He is winning, lovable, and as an actor, Highnmore has a poise well beyond his years.  The film is by turns, funny, aching, lyrical, and ultimately it has its moments of sheer joy, and it earns every one of them.

The films was a must-have for me on Blu-ray between the gorgeous cinematography and fabulous meoldic score by Mark Macina.  The film is stunning in 1080p.  There is not a single flaw on the print or the high-def transfer.  Blacks are inky, colors have wonderful saturation, and there is a light veneer or grain in the image retaining the film-like look.  The Dolby TrueHD sound is a revelation, as opposed to the lossy standard track.  The scene where August plays his rhapsody the church organ is booming, exciting, with enormous detail added.  This is a fine example of how high def only enhances and serves the story rather than special effects and explosions.  The current price of this disc makes it a no brainer if you are a fan of the film.  To those new to it, this is the way to see it.  It's perfectly suitable for children (my 8 yr old LOVED it), although it is not a children's movie.  Highest recommendation.",1274400000,,2811,4.495069033530572
3349869,5,B0013K7ZUE,"What a nice movie, a pleasant film.  There are lots of twists and turns in this, and I kept waiting for the Hollywood version of the Greek tragedy, but it didn't happen.  This flick will leave you smiling and maybe even a bit misty eyed, a great one to watch with your spouse or SO.

Music is the backdrop, and the acting is as superb as the story is improbable.  For once Robin Williams doesn't dominate the scenes but plays the part of the benevolent scoundrel, who you'd love to hate, but can't. Freddie Highmore, the ""orphan,"" will steal your heart and you keep rooting for him as he squirms and wriggles through one musical scene after another trying to locate the parents he is convinced are still alive - parents who all the officials assure him are no longer around.

The story will suck you in, the music, a seemingly wacky combination of classical, street and pop, will entertain you and you'll not want any interruptions while you enjoy the story. Very difficult not to rate as five-stars !!",1273708800,,1002,4.544444444444444

The plot, the actors, the music, the journey is just right for me.

Here it is nearly 1:00 a.m. and I am so alert. Really I feel energized with that kind of ""you can do it"" energy. I love when a movie gives me something positive. It's like a sort of nourishment.

I've just finished watching this movie and I feel like I can watch it all over again. I am uplifted, energized, hopeful, creative, and just filled with something that is inspiring and encouraging.

I do enjoy Freddy Hightower (Finding Neverland).  Found Kerri Russel to be a breath of fresh air.  Loved the music!
True, the story line is highly improbable, but it will remain a favorite and, once again, I do have to rebuy it since I can't find my copy.  Most likely loaned it to someone for their viewing pleasure!

It immediately jumped to my Top-5 all-time, and I consider this the Wizard Of Oz of movies about music.  PG-rated only because of slight thematic elements, it's still worth watching with kids who are old enough to understand real-world (these days, that's around 7).  Watch the movie!

There was a connection between them the second they met and on that day a musical genius was conceived. The day she gave birth, Lyla's father made a choice that he claimed was for both of them, but it was really a selfish decision. Lyla no longer had her son and she was separated from Louis.
Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) listened to sounds of the wind, city streets, etc and he would hear music. He was in a home for boys where his gift was not appeciated because they saw him as freakishly different. He wanted to be with his birth parents, not placed in someone's home. He had no anger because they gave him up, but was consumed with thoughts of where they could possibly be and he kept believing he could follow the music that would lead him to them.
I enjoyed August Rush. Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams)bothered me a bit, though. He acted like he cared about Evan but he didn't really want this boy to be happy. He deceived him and tried to fill his mind with doubt. Wizard's thinking was all messed up because he was scarred by the foster care system. He lived in an abandoned theater with homeless children he was supposedly taking care of but he was really using them. It was a good thing Richard Jeffries (Terrance Howard) cared about what happened to Evan.

3349896,1,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush was the cinematic equivalent of drinking straight from a bottle of Karo corn syrup.
First of all, the kid's style of guitar playing is strongly reminiscent of the late Michael Hedges so if you like that sound - and it is a very cool sound - try listening to the real thing and buy a Michael Hedges CD or go watch some of his video on YouTube.

Ok, now the ugly part... I'm a 54 year-old musician who believes music can found everywhere (one of this movie's themes).  I really related to the early part of the movie ""August"" is hearing melody and rhythm in various natural sounds (like the wind blowing through a field of grain)  When I was a teenager, long before the advent of sampling, I used to hear music in steam vents at an asphalt factory I worked at on the Pugent Sound.  I wanted to find a way to capture and execute that sound on strips of recording tape triggered by a keyboard (similar to a Mellotron in mechanics). I really do get the idea.  But then the movie disintegrates into a series of sappy situations and ""awakening"" events that are just too far fetched; this was perhaps the lamest, sappiest and most unbelievable drivel I have ever watched in my life.  Come on, did a junior high school drama enthusiast write this screenplay?

A good movie, especially fiction, has to find a way to suspend belief.  August Rush fails miserably. Sure, a savant could start playing an instrument almost immediately.  But a savant (even Mozart) couldn't sit down and start writing musical notation without even 5 minutes of study to understand the lexicon used.  That's just preposterous.  And even if the kid could do that impossible feat, how would he know the ranges and tunings of the various instruments when writing those parts.

It's too bad because with just a modicum of care and research this movie actually could have been made a little more believable.  The idea about music being every where really intrigued me and that's why I watched it.  August Rush was simply awful and an ordeal - a whirlpool of Karo corn syrup.  Yuck.

Years before his parents had also been brought together when both ""heard the music"" as they were playing in two seperate concerts. As this movie progresses music continues to play as an important role as August learns how to play a guitar simply by looking at another kid playing, finds out how to write music, and finally writes his own rhapsody. As August is improving his ability and sharing his talent, his parents are each on a journey to discover they're love of music again. The end of this movie is an emotional thrill and the final song will break your heart everytime.

It has a really great story, even though a lot of it is hard to believe. Like the fact that the boy never had any musical training, but can pick up a guitar for the first time and automatically just start playing it like a pro, or how he had never seen a note written down before in his life yet somehow is able to write an entire musical score in a half a days time.

I do want to say that the music in it is amazing. Very catchy, yet emotionally powerful.

All the same, this is a great family movie which is enjoyable and fun to watch as long as you don't pay too much attention to how impossible some of what happens really is. But hey, what else is fiction for other then to suspend reality a little bit?",1246233600,,884,4.017045454545454

3349927,5,B0013K7ZUE,"""The music is all around, all you have to do...is listen"", August Rush

Evan is an 11 year boy, who lived all his life in an adoption agency, waiting all his life to find his parents, whom he is sure love him and can't wait to see him.
He listens to all the musical sounds in nature, which he believes will help him find his parents. His parents did not know he even existed, but they always sensed a feeling in the air that he does. He follows the music until he reaches New York. He learns how to play music there until he develops into becoming a genius musician. He joins one of the best music school there. After a short while he becomes a professional music compser. One night he composes music infront of thousands of people, turns his back and finds his parents looking at him with pride and love, and they finally get back together with him after long 11 years.

This movie is magnificent. The story is very original, the casting is great, and its very emotional and touchy as well.

A movie about the very precious relationship betwen parents and their children, particularly between a mother and her child.
We take our parents for granted, however there are many people who would wish to spend 1 day with their parents, when they can't.

Love your parents. Give them the care and love they deserve. You will not know how much they love you until you yourself become a parent.

3349932,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I have all of Alex O'Loughlin's work on DVD, so of course I had to add August Rush. I had seen it in the theater after discovering Alex on Moonlight. Alex would have been cast as the lead of this film, but was told that a ""bigger name"" was needed. Alex was still fairly new to the industry in the US after being a leading man in Australia. I admire his bravery, coming to the US and basically starting over from scratch. He is a brilliant talent, and should have had the lead in this movie. Since JRM was chosen due to his ""bigger name"", the part of Marshall Connelly was made larger for Alex since he made such an impression. In my opinion, as always, Alex outshines everyone else in this film. I saw it at the theater and then bought the DVD - just for Alex. Alex is Australian and can do any accent - his Irish accent as Marshall is impeccable. I actually have a friend who is Irish, and she said that it was funny that Alex's accent was better than JRM's, since JRM is Irish.  Alex also plays his own guitar and sings in the scenes where they show the brothers' band days, and his talent shines through there as well.
I have known people who didn't know who Alex was when they saw August Rush (Moonlight had just premiered. Then when they did see him in Moonlight and in some of his other movies later, they said, ""oh, that's the guy I liked so much in August Rush!""

August Rush: [opening voice-over] Listen. Can you hear it? The music. I can hear it everywhere. In the wind... in the air... in the light. It's all around us. All you have to do is open yourself up. All you have to do... is listen.
=============================

August Rush is a fairy tale of a film, a really inspiring story of a boy in an orphanage who dreams of finding his parents--hearing music in the world and also inside himself that leads him ever onward in his quest. Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) likes music ""more than food"" and he has talent to burn. He is a musical prodigy with an incredible gift.

He goes to New York where, drawn to the music, he finds the lair of Wizard (Robin Williams)--a Fagin-like entrepenuer, but instead of grooming pickpockets like Aftful Dodger, he grooms buskers like Arthur (Leon Thomas III). Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace is a complex character, creepy and malevolent--but not entirely evil as he does believe in the power and grace of music. It is just that, when faced with someone as talented as Evan, he can't resist the temptation to exploit his talent. He does, however, give the boy a guitar and a flashy stage name: August Rush.

--------------
Wizard: You know what music is? God's little reminder that there's something else besides us in this universe, a harmonic connection between all living beings, every where, even the stars.
======================

Robin Williams, master of comedy, is also adept at playing creepy sociopaths, such as Seymour Parrish in One Hour Photo or Rainbow Randolph in Death to Smoochy. His Wizard is perhaps his best creepy sociopath yet, and he wins the best of show award here.

Meanwhile, Evan's mother Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), a cellist, is trying to find him, and his father, Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is trying to find Lyla. Louis is also a musician, naturally, and he sings and plays bass in a rock band. When the cops try to take down Wizard's squat, August rushes off and seeks sanctuary in a Gospel church. He hears some really good Gospel singing there, especially from a young girl named Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). She teaches him to read music, and about one second later he starts writing his Opus One, August's Rhapsody in C Major. Hope sees his music and goes to tell the Reverand about it. When they find him at the church organ, they hear his obvious talent and send him immediately to Julliard.

If this all sounds a little hard to swallow, it isn't. The film spins its fairy tale with such finesse that you are perfectly willing to suspend your disbelief. The music is great, especially the parts where August Rush discovers the guitar. Some really great singing by Jamia Simone Nash and Leon Thomas III, who both, by the way, have sung on The Backyardigans (who are HUGE to the toddler crowd, just ask my great nephew, Casson Hunter Porter). I wondered if Leon Thomas III was related to Leon Thomas who is known for his work with Pharoah Sanders, particularly the 1969 song ""The Creator Has a Master Plan"" from Sanders' Karma album. Thomas's most distinctive device was that he often broke out into yodeling. This style influenced James Moody and Tim Buckley, among others. It would have made for a really good story, but apparently the two Leon Thomases are not related.

Nevertheless, August Rush is quite inspiring, and fun for the whole family. Freddie Highmore did a fantastic job as August Rush, and I see that he was also Charlie Bucket in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Peter Llewelyn Davies in Finding Neverland--both with Johnny Depp. Add to that August Rush, and the young Mr. Highmore has made quite an impressive fairy tale triptych.

August Rush: Sometimes the world tries ot knock it out of you. But I believe in music the way that some people believe in fairy tales. I like to imagine that what I hear came from my mother and father. Maybe the notes I hear, are the same ones they heard, the night they met. Maybe that's how they found each other. Maybe that's how they'll find me. I believe that once upon a time, long ago, they heard the music and followed it.

Even used a piano style technique on the fretboard that would at least have gotten a nod from Eddie Van Halen. Please, give me a break. I get it. It's a fantasy. Maybe science fiction? Of course it takes hours of study and effort to get anything resembling music out of any instrument. Ok, maybe not a kazoo. I guess the sale of musical instruments will skyrocket now.

And I wanted to love the storyline. I just couldn't get myself to do it. It was like a really good cinematographer who decided to let his girlfriend write the script not because she could write, but because he truly loved her.

Others have pointed out all of the ""miracles"" that keep happening to make this movie have a happy ending. With just a tweak here and there it would have been better. The evil Dad could have been shown paying off the Irish musician to leave the daughter alone. And why has a perfectly normal kid been left without any kind of at least a foster home from infancy or did I miss that part? Just a few changes--storyline would have been better.

However, the idea that music is in the world all around us was just brilliantly portrayed. I also loved all of the music that was performed and so that more than made up for the nonsense.

3349961,4,B0013K7ZUE,"This is a different sort of movie for me.  I tend to prefer movies with great dialogue and watertight plots - and this movie, although it has some important dialogue, is also significant for the dialogue that it leaves out.  It also has a plot that is so surrealistic that it requires suspension of belief.  And the montages, as everyone is rushing towards the concert in Central Park, are beautiful but I can't help asking things like, ""How did Mr. Jeffries get there in time?  Where was August's tuxedo?""

It was also interesting to watch the scenes which were deleted.  They contained talk and exposition - but the movie is a fairytale which requires faith rather than logic.  Another missing scene (not one of the deleted) why didn't Lyla, Louis and August say anything to each other at the end?  The answer was that words were insufficient - music and video had to capture what could not be expressed in words.

I recommend that watchers put aside their attachment to wit and logical consistency and pay attention to what works in the film. The film has the interesting premise that the universe is connected to each other through sound and music.  (I think it might be connected on other dimensions as well.)  We just need to listen, and we might become aware.

And, if you watch the movie carefully, you will pick up certain gems.  For example, it is Wiz playing down below when Lyla and Louis spend their only night together.  The expressiveness of the faces of the actors who play Louis and August are absolutley fabulous.  The one real musician - the girl who plays Hope - makes our spirits soar when she sings.

Appreciating this film requires a different approach.  It's like having to stand back when looking at paintings by Monet and Renoir.  It's not the same as appreciating the work of a photographer - but the film is beautiful and can give you a rewarding and illuminating experience.",1231372800,,1903,4.663663663663663

I never believed from the get go that the two musicians fell in love, that they could never have found each other earlier, that a baby could be born and given to an orphanage without the mother's consent or even knowing what really happended, etc. etc.
The dialouge was insipid and contrived; the dialouge during the scene where the two musicians have their once in life time one night stand;actually made me cringe it was so melodramatic and stupid.

3349964,1,B0013K7ZUE,"We rented this movie after my sister said it was her favorite movie of '08.  I found it completely unrealistic.  I wonder if anyone really musical was involved in creating the storyline of this movie.
One major flaw was Lyla's special invitation to be a featured performer after 11 years of not really playing the cello.  Is there a Julliard graduate out there who can confirm that after such a long lapse in practicing, there is any way that Lyla can brush up in (what appeared to be) a week, and give a stunning performance to a discerning audience?
Another impossibility is Evan/August's theory progress in one day.  It doesn't matter how amazing your genes are, you will not be writing 16th notes and more in your first day of composing if you've only been introduced to basic quarter notes in a beginner piano book.  How absurd!  And speaking of genes, although his parents were gifted musicians, Evan had ZERO exposure to music except in-utero and out in nature(??) until he was 11.  A musical prodigy may have musical genes, but is also heavily exposed to music.  Mozart began playing the harpsichord at age 3 and didn't begin composing until about 6.  He did not hop on the piano the first day and compose.
Just two examples of many absurdities.  Perhaps the greatest is the idea of two people pining after each other for 11 years after a one-night-stand.  Is this really ""great for the whole family?""  I found myself relating to Lyla's dad (being protective after the party-not forging signatures and lying), who was made out to be a villain in the movie.

I am a classic movie lover myself, and this movie is part of my video collection.  The relationship between the couples in both movies share common elements.  The naive, sheltered girl falls for the guy from the opposite side of the track.  Both have a talent for the stage.  She has an overbearing, overprotective parent.  The couple separate.  Years pass.  The child follows in the parents' footsteps.  The couple reunite in the audience on their child's big night on stage.  The movies even end the same way in the final scene.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Boy musician (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meets girl musician (Keri Russell) and they make beautiful music up on the roof before going their separate ways
2. Little orphan boy (Freddie Highmore) hears music in the wind and feels a connection to the parents he never knew
3. Desperately seeking parents, he winds up in New York City where he is taken in (in more ways than one) by a man named Wizard (Robin Williams, channeling Fagin)
4. He discovers a previously dormant musical talent, and impresses everyone
5. Fairytale ending will leave you asking or more

This movie is actually a modern day fairy tale, with an incredibly talented cast and a fantastic soundtrack.  In fact, it is the music that makes it so special, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  This is one to own and watch over and over again.

3349973,4,B0013K7ZUE,"""August Rush"" is a ""magic movie"".  It's a movie about the power of love and music, which ultimately seem much more powerful in this film than they are in real life.
The story is about Evan Taylor, a boy who lives in a home for children without parents.  Evan knows that his parents are out in the world, though, and he desires to find them, through the power of music, which he says they ""gave to him"".  And indeed, this music is very powerful as he sets out on a journey to find his parents--just two people--in New York City.
If I told anymore, I would give a lot of the story away.  So I'll just say, this movie is a feel-good film.  Practical thinkers probably won't enjoy it as much, since there isn't much practicality in it.  It's a Hollywood movie to the core--true, deep love is portrayed as a one night stand, and events take place that would never happen in the real world.  But that's what movies--and music--is for, right?  To transport viewers and listeners to a different world.  And if so, ""August Rush"" does a pretty good job of it.

(I also like to add in a bit about content in the films I review.  As a 16-year-old Christian girl, I always appreciate reviews that shed some light on the objectionable content in a film.  So below is a summary of things parents might want to take into consideration.)

Love between two people in this film is portrayed as one night together on a rooftop of New York under the stars.  You never actually see anything, but you know they did more than kiss because the girl is pregnant later on.  All you see are the two of them lying on a couch on the roof in each other's arms.

A few d-words are spoken, mostly by a little boy.  God's name is used in vain a few times.  If you watch the deleted scenes, there is one that shows a character yelling out God's name and the d-word at a little kid.

The character played by Robin Williams is a little threatening at times.  While he ""cares"" for the street kids, his character doesn't really come across as caring.  Instead, he seems like a greedy, abusive sort of man.  You wonder if it was supposed to be implied that he was on drugs.  Either that, or the dude was just kinda doodly in the head.",1228176000,,2194,4.297560975609756

3349975,5,B0013K7ZUE,This is a great urban type of fairytale story . The music really sets this tale apart from others like it. Really worth watching,1228089600,,128,4.375
3349976,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Have you ever stopped and listened to the sounds all around you?  Did you hear the crickets, the wind chimes, the sounds of the wind?  They create music, a symphony when all is put together.  It is so beautiful and majestic.  Even taking in the scenery that paints pictures before you, can add to the wonders of the natural sounds.  August Rush (2007) is the perfect movie to turn your attention to these everyday surroundings.  Not only is it a movie of music and the power it holds, but it is also a movie of love, whether it be romantic love, friendly love, or the love of a family.  August Rush has it.  Its story line is unique, and is harmoniously constructed.
 I give a great deal of credit to the writers, James V. Hart (screenplay), Nick Castle (screenplay and story), and Paul Castro (story).  I applaud the producers, the crew behind the movie, and the director, Kirsten Sheridan.  There were many camera angles used; most were close-ups, but some long shots were included.  There was a scene at the beginning of the film where both of these types of shots were shown.  Lyla Novacek, (Keri Russell), and Louis Connelly, (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), just met on the rooftop of a building, and the close-ups of their faces showed sparkles in their eyes, they both looked happy and free.  In this same scene, a long shot showed a man walking, later to be revealed as Wizard, (Robin Williams), on the sidewalk beneath them playing a harmonica.  The camera was zoomed out and in when necessary, and used in so many different angles.  At one point the camera zoomed out rapidly from a close-up on Russell, when she thought she saw her son.  The watcher could really get a feel for the characters throughout the movie.
 It was great to see the way the music carried emotions, the lighting formed a scene or character, and the shots told the viewer what to think and feel about what was being shot.  The different sets, especially the broken down theater, proved that the props and sets were well thought about.  The costumes were mainly modern day, and the accents of the actors fit who they were described to be.  For example, Louis was an Irish character, and that's just the accent he carried.  Symbolism came with the moon and music, which was the connection between Evan Taylor, (Freddie Highmore), Lyla, and Louis.  Wizard said a quote in the movie that revealed the role symbolism played in this particular film.  He said, ""Music is...God's little reminder there's something else besides us in this universe.  Harmonic connection between all living beings everywhere, even the stars.""  The setting took place in numerous cities.  They were, San Francisco, Chicago, and a few different cities in New York, all mentioned in the movie at least once.
 The movie started out with capturing the viewer as, Evan Taylor/August Rush, spoke while only a black screen showed.  He was an orphan who believed the music talked to him.  He even ran away from the orphanage because ""the music told him to.""  He was on the search of his parents, listening to the music to find his way.  Along the way, he met a boy named Arthur X, (Leon G. Thomas III), who introduced Evan to Wizard.  After discovering the musical prodigy that Evan was, and fearing that he would be taken away, Wizard gave Evan Taylor the name of August Rush.  August continued his journey with the help of other characters throughout the film. As he searched for Lyla, his mother, she, soon after, began the search for him, and Louis, his father, began the search for her.  The movie shows these three different lives and how they are intertwined.  Richard Jeffries, (Terrance Howard), winds up playing a big part in the paths of these characters.  August's life and search was the main focus though.  His search revealed yet another symbol, a necklace, which symbolized that he was on the right track in his journey.
  This original script will fill you with emotion, questions, and even wonder.  Lie back, and let the music take you away in this hope filled, love story.  Discover how a necklace showed that August was on the right track.  Embrace new levels of imagination as music brings magic to the film and opens you up to ideas you never thought possible.  Answer your own questions: Are Lyla, Louis, and August ever connected together?  Does the music bring them to the end of their search on a high note?  Follow the music and find out for yourself in August Rush.",1228003200,,4432,4.675291073738681

And I'm quickly becoming a Jonathan Rhys Meyer fan.  For me the point of the film is to reflect the power of music and how it tends to connect people more than anything else in life.  Frankly it punched all my sappy buttons and I just loved it.",1227830400,,593,4.315315315315315
3349979,3,B0013K7ZUE,"I wish Freddie Highmore was a better actor, otherwise I could have really fallen for this picture in a big way, but perforce the screenplay had to keep returning from more interesting byways to focus on August's plight, and my heart sank each time.  Funny thing too, for I used to like seeing Freddie in his other films: maybe he just isn't up to this particular part, for all he does here is widen his eyes with inexpressible delight every time he hears *music,* and then, as if that wasn't enough, those eyes widen further every time he hears mere *sound.*  Nick Castle, the screenwriter, is always bad with kids: he is the madman responsible for HOOK and also he directed the horrid movie version of DENNIS THE MENACE and should have been exiled to Neptune for those crimes.  And sorry, little Freddie just doesn't look like he could possibly be the son of Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.

Speaking of which, for me the picture lost dramatic plausibility the minute rich girl Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) lays eyes on emo musician Louis Connelly (Rhys Meyers) in the shadow of Washington Square Arch.  He invites her to climb up and sit by him.  Sorry, if he were the last man on earth you wouldn't catch me sitting on a high parapet next to Jonathan Rhys Meyers, I'd be too afraid he'd just tip me over the side of the building.  ANY stranger, but especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  There's something sinister and creepy about him, though maybe Lyla's drawn to him because of a similar streak in her own father (Bill Sadler, the sheriff from ROSWELL), who has a strange fixation on her that leads to terrible consequences.

I kept thinking there must have been scenes deleted from the movie, scenes covering the character arc of little Arthur (Leon Thomas III), whom we first see as the prize prodigy of crazy Wizard (Robin Williams), busking in Washington Square Park like a tiny rock star.  As the film progresses, it's rather like ALL ABOUT EVE, with Evan Taylor/August Rush gradually supplanting poor Arthur in Wizard's affections, and becoming super famous and desired, while Arthur just stands there looking glum.  Does he resent the white boy's success?  Is it a parable for American race relations--August even gets to keep the very guitar Arthur once played?  I think so, but it's almost as if they wanted to keep this aspect of the film muted--and in general, black children AND adults are nothing but helpful and kind to the lad of mysterious origins, August Rush, even saving his life on more than one occasion.  This must be why poor Terrence Howard (whom I hope they paid a huge sum to) gets to appear in the film as the helpful, kind social worker.  When you see him, your heart swells with sympathy, feeling sorry for the man who was once going to be the next big thing in the movies, and now he's playing a distant second or third fiddle to Freddie Highmore, sob.",1227139200,,2889,4.659448818897638

3349983,3,B0013K7ZUE,"""August Rush"" is the kind of film that everyone says you HAVE to watch, as it will 'change your life'. Despite being a fairly new release, it has achieved some sort of cult status on the home video circuit, and I predict that in a few years it will be up there with 'Field of Dreams' as a constant seller on DVD.

That said, I am not one for sappy mediocrity and obvious sentimentality, and this movie has loads of it. From the opening five minutes to the absolutely useless climax (yes, I know it worked for many viewers, but I thought it ruined the film), every scene is worked in such a way that you can't help but see the end coming from a mile away.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a fine looking human being, but he looked awkwardly out of place and insensitive in his role here, played out with obviously no passion. Far better is Keri Russell who plays the female lead - this is one actress who has so far been underutilized in general, and here she is no different. Freddie Highmore takes all the credit in his breakthrough performance here - its a finely nuanced performance by a young actor we should see more of.

On the surface, ""August Rush"" is the sad tale of a child who believes his birth parents are out there somewhere. Both his birth parents are musicians, and the child inherits their musical genius. The final scene is a spectacle, where the young boy 'brings together' his parents under a brilliant night sky, all while conducting a symphony. Its glorious, beautiful, etc, but somehow it still did not move me. I guess the really bad performances by Meyers and Russell during the last five minutes really capsized the film, which is a pity. The last scene, which SHOULD be really powerful, just comes and goes.

The DVD has NO REAL extras... Added scenes are really it for additional content you may appreciate. (I don't count ""Scene Selection"" and ""Language Options"" as DVD Extras...) The DVD (not the movie) is why I gave this product 4 stars...

With that said... Here is the good.

There are 147 5 star ratings for this movie... and this movie is worth more IMHO. Here is my experience with this film.

Over a 2 week period:

My wife and I caught half of this on our Tivo.

Then we recorded it and watched two more times (on our Tivo).

Then we went and bought the DVD and watched it AGAIN, and each time we were reduced to blubbering tears of happiness... (Her not me... well I was a little choked up... but not as much as her.)

So the good in this movie demonstrates much of what is missing in our world today...

Faith, that things will be OK even when things look bleak.

Commitment, even when circumstances get in the way of being dedicated to an idea, dream, or a special person.

Serendipity, when many in our world feel like nothing good will happen to them. (Though they secretly hope it will.)

And Patience... something most of us just don't ever get to see on a daily basis...

This moving is truly deserving of the ""Truly Moving Picture"" award on the back of the DVD.

August Rush is not just a story about a boy prodigy who tries to reconnect to his parents through a shared gift of music.  No, this is a story that teaches a lesson about being true to yourself and listening to those strong feelings that we all have from within.

Of course we are all not blessed with the musical genius that ""August"" possessed, but we do all have something from within that we can and should be passionate about, something we should have absolute and unwavering belief in.  We just need to listen to that inner voice and pursue that dream rather than following the masses because it is the ""right"" thing to do.

I thought the actors were well cast and for the most part were believable.  The story itself left me shaking my head a couple of times but that is okay- I still enjoyed it and the music was great.

While I enjoyed it overall, I would have liked it better if they focused more on this boy's musical talents as he was growing up, instead it starts after he is already a preteen, and the Movie focuses more on building to the climax of his musical talent bringing his lost parents together which was the end of the movie.  The best parts of the movie total about 15-20 minutes, and the rest of it seems like nothing more than filler.  This movie could have been so much better if the focus was more about the life and behavior of a growing child musical prodigy, rather than what is offered.  The ending alone, does make the movie worth watching, and it was the only part that got me involved emotionally.  I rate it four stars for the ending, the rest of it I would rate two stars.

3349992,2,B0013K7ZUE,"Well, August Rush wasn't terrible, but it just didn't do the job for this viewer. The movie tells the story of Evan (Freddie Highmore), a young orphan in a boy's home somewhere in New York state. Evan insists that he can hear music everywhere, that he knows his parents want him and will find him, that he doesn't want to be placed with a new family because he's already GOT a family.

Rewind 11 years to meet Lyla (Kerri Russell), a famed cellist, with a controlling father and an engagement to play with the New York Philharmonic. After her big performance, she meets Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the lead singer in a band, at a party. The two instantly click and share a passionate night together. However, the next day, Lyla's father forbids her from seeing Louis again and ships her off . . . somewhere.

Lyla later discovers she's pregnant due to her encounter with Louis, but cannot find him. A car accident late in her pregnancy lands her in the hospital. While Lyla is still unconscious, her father gives her baby up for adoption. When she comes to, he tells her the baby died as a result of the accident. The baby, of course, is Evan.

Back to the present - Determined to find his parents, Evan runs away from the orphanage. ""Following the music"" lands him in New York City, where he meets all sorts of unsavory characters, discovers his own musical talents, and searches for the missing pieces of his family.

While I think the initial concept of this movie was a decent one, it suffered in the execution. Too many plotpoints were thin or didn't make sense. Too many things seemed sooooo improbable that it kept me from fully engaging in the world of the movie. And it was so sugary sweet that I almost got a toothache.

All performances were pretty solid (though one does wonder why Louis' Irish brogue hasn't softened at least a little after living in the U.S. for 10+ years). I fully believe that, with a better script, this could have been a great movie.

3349997,2,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is set around the feel-good magic of mystical musical bonds that occur between 3 of the 4 main characters of the movie; a family physically separated but spiritually aware of one-another. Their link is pure wondrous fantasy and there's nothing wrong with that, but then we are presented with the mechanism with which the 3 will be united -- it is there that I find a huge difficulty in liking this movie.

I love music as a listener and performer and have always felt that it has a magical quality to it. But a good fantasy (for me) always takes an element of magic, such as the mystical musical bond between Lyla and her son and her one-night-stand lover, and presents its protagonist with some sort of challenge to perfect the magic.

Yet no fantasy challenge arises. Lyla's son, Evan, is simply magical, except when he's not, who's to tell? His instant, and I do mean instant guitar and pipe organ playing skills and musical notation skills were pure fantasy without effort. Evan, aka August Rush picks up a guitar for the first time and with no fine motor skills training channels the ghost of Michael Hedges (check him out if you liked Evan's style of guitar playing; frankly, I was offended by the artistic rip-off as the physically demanding and technically challenging techniques that Evan just pulls out thin air were invented by the late Mr. Hedges). He is befriended by a kindly reverend and a young girl, a refugee in the church, and immediately learns how to read and score music with no tutelage. There were opportunities to spend a few movie minutes here and there to make Evan's transformation from a non-musician to a guitar playing god more believable, but the director went for a lazy  prefab genius/magic boy route more often then not. Even when Evan/August winds up a musical ""student"" at his mother's alma-mater, Julliard, he is shown to be teaching the teachers almost from the get-go; no strain to perfect his magical musical ability.

But there is something, nay, somebody in Evan's way, somebody preventing him from uniting with his mystically gathering family. That somebody is a money-grubbing, lost-soul ex-musician, played by Robin Williams. This promising character could have added much more to the story. How did he lose his soul, could he get it back? Did he have a mystical tie to Evan's parents other than mere happenstance? In what way was his nickname, the Wizard, warranted? We'll never know, the character is instead used as a throw away impediment to Evan's quest to find family. And is about as menacing as a junk yard dog on a leash when he's not being a sympathetic character. In short, the ""wizard's"" story is a tepid voyage to nowhere.

So August Rush veers between reality and pure fantasy, with neither faction presented with any sort of conviction -- no hint of real struggle or conquest or even surprise as Evan is united with his mother and father at the end.

I find it interesting that there are so many high ratings for this movie, while at the same time reviewers frequently acknowledge that this movie is full holes (Those mentioned above are by no means an exhaustive list). Is this the price of a nice feel-good movie; to be sold on the idea that intellect and emotion are entirely at odds? If there's anything we should have learned by now from Disney/Pixar, it's that you don't have to overly dumb-down stories to your children to get them to appreciate fantasy and happiness; and adults shouldn't have to dumb-down their expectations for movies that appeal to all.

Great heart-warming spiritual premise merits two and a half stars, but the vision is sorely muddled by the half-baked efforts of the writers and director.",1222041600,,3693,4.778996865203761

His pure dedication toward following the music and how that always leads him to a better place is amazing.  Yes, there are a lot of incidents that could be viewed as ""unrealistic"" such as Freddie suddenly being able to write in musical notation after a 1-minute lesson from a little girl.  For me, I let these go as telescoping a time sequence.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Louis who has a charged one-night-stand with Keri Russell's character Lyla which results in the orphan scenario.  Rhys-Meyers won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a mini-series for ""Elvis.""  Keri Russell was stunning in the independent film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waitress-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000VY1EYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waitress (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Since both Lyla & Louis are musicians, it follows that August's superb musical talent flowed from and connects him to his parents.  Terrence Howard has a subtle role as the social worker Richard Jeffries who seems behind the curve in helping the boy.  We get a sense of an overloaded social services system where people fall through the cracks.  Howard is an incredible actor from his appearance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-Eyes/dp/B00005NRO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel Eyes</a>&nbsp;to what National Board of Review called a ""Breakthrough Performance"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;to his Oscar-nominated performance in ""Hustle & Flow.""  He makes the small role shine.  William Sadler from the ""Roswell"" TV show plays Lyla's dad Thomas Novacek.  He is really the heavy in the film with forging Lyla's name on an important document.  Robin Williams who earned his Oscar for ""Good Will Hunting"" has a difficult task as Wizard.  On one hand, we see his inspiration in music.  On the other, he's very greedy.  We want him to be nicer.  Marian Seldes has a nice cameo as the Dean of Julliard.  I found the film enthralling.  By the end as the parents are drawn through the crowd toward their son by the music, tears were rolling down my cheeks.  ""August Rush"" is a sentimental and romantic film that has grains of truth that are also inspirational.  This is a film I want to own.  Bravo!",1221004800,,3209,6.653846153846154
3349999,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Once in a long while, you get a movie that's so unabashedly sentimental and sweet that you tell yourself it really shouldn't work but it does. In fact, it's so warm and fuzzy (read: unrealistic) that you scream at the cynical voice within to shut-up! ""August Rush"" is such a movie. Watched this on DVD late last night and loved every single frame of the movie. It's so good that if I could lick the movie, I would.

Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is a musical prodigy who grows up in an orphanage believing that his parents are still alive. So he sets out on a quest to create music that will draw his parents to him. Along the way, he gets picked up by the ""Wizard"" (Robin Williams) who wants to exploit his musical talents for money. His parents are actually the famous concert cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish guitarist and lead singer from a rock band. He's the result of a ""one-night-stand"" 11 years ago. Lyla's father lied to her that the baby had died when in truth, he sent him to an orphanage.

The entire movie feels so unreal that it's almost like a song, a concerto. It celebrates music as the ultimate wordless communication between us. It celebrates the harmony of the universe, the music of the spheres, the sounds of the winds and the rhythms of our heartbeats. Granted, it's not for everyone - certainly not for the cynic at heart.

3350004,2,B0013K7ZUE,"I'd have enjoyed this movie more if... well, if it had been better! I was expecting a serious movie and was dealt a Dickensian (1/2 of this story is Oliver Twist), Hollywood fairy-tale where actors are merely props for the movie's symbolism: Keri Russell is sublime and disciplined classical music and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is hip and emotional Rock and Roll. A short-lived fling gives birth to Freddie Highmore, a super-gifted, musically inclined child who integrates both of his parents' artistic temperaments. They move through life longing for one another, both parents unaware of their boy's existence. Robin Williams plays an interesting character, the only complex one in the movie, who comes into Highmore's life during his time of need, gives him a name but whose relationship must eventually be abandoned. Williams' character also represents, to me, the stages of a career in music which in the end goes bad: Inspired and driven by love of the art initially, which then turns materialistic and self-destructive.

The original aspects could have, if they had been done correctly by writer/director Kirsten Sheridan, been interesting, yet from the writing board to the final product much was lost. What is beyond reproach are her sets and shots; she has the ability to create in her movies a world one wants to live in. I absolutly love her use of colors and light. Yet, using actors as chess pieces to tell a story is just bad film-making, I'd have expected better from her.

The problem is that once a writer or director decides to make symbols out of characters, the actor is trapped into playing the same note (and isn't that ironic?). That premise leads the movie to make several unbelievably stupid choices: After Rhys-Meyers abandons his super-hip band in New York (there was talk about ""going back to Ireland"") he finds an unlikely, super-cushy job in California. This type of overtly-privileged fantasy life is fine for the OC or 90210, not for a movie that wants to be deep. I can -grudgingly- let that go but when he runs into a former band mate years later we find that although the band broke up after he left, somehow they ALL end up living in California and within driving distance of each other! This is just insulting your audience. Beyond that, August Rush is just enervatingly sentimental; I haven't rolled my eyes at a movie so much since the English Patient.

This movie has heart, is beautifully shot, family friendly and even something you might enjoy if you are in the right mood. It is about a universe of sounds and how harmony brings us together, about integrating all the notes in our scale and the value of art, discipline, emotion and Love. Too bad there's a droning single note throughout the movie and an excessive amount of emotional sap that makes August Rush easy to be cynical about.",1219017600,,2826,4.846790890269151

Nearly every movie has some unrealistic ""hollywood"" aspects to it that stretch believability, but I have never seen anything that quite compares to August Rush in this way. Keri Russell is not very believable as a renowned concert cellist in the first place. On top of that, when she is playing a concert at the beginning and end of the film, she somehow knows that her true love, Jonathan Rhys-meyers, is playing a rock concert somewhere at the same time, and he knows that she is playing a concert at the same time, and their music is perfectly in sync, and somehow at the end of the film she knows that her son can hear her playing through a subway grate, and somehow the boy ends up running away from the evil Robin Williams just in time to make it to the concert to squeeze into a tux and direct the Juilliard orchestra playing his composition, and somehow he knows that his mom and dad are in the audience standing down in the first row... you get the idea.

In almost every aspect of the movie, I feel the final product fell way short.  The story was developed very poorly, probably made worse by poor direction and bad editing. All I know is I didn't believe any of it. I didn't understand the notoriety surrounding the mother musician; her character was never developed so one could believe in her ability. They added to the disbelief by the few times they showed Keri Russell ""playing"" the cello; she didn't fake it very well... they could have done that better.  And I can think of a dozen of actors that have more musical ability and presence than Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He can't play, he can't sing, and the song they chose for him to ""write"" sucked. The actors conveyed no passion for their music or the feeling that music was really a part of them; Although I tried, I could never fool myself to believe they were musicians.  August (Freddie Highmore) was more convincing, but even he was way too deadpan and passionless (except occasionally when he was playing). Robin Williams had more passion and feeling than everyone else in the movie put together, but even his character seemed fragmented and untrue.  The story was developed poorly from beginning to end. This is so disappointing considering the potential this story had. The idea of music being all around us and in everything is powerful and compelling, and the idea of a prodigy like August developing and becoming public is thrilling. But this movie didn't convey these ideas well at all and was about the least powerful and compelling or thrilling movie I've seen in awhile.  This movie had no ring of truth to it at all.

After seeing the DVD, I'm sorry I waited so long to see this film. It's enchanting and heart warming and an all around feel good flick.

The story focuses on Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore), a young boy growing up in a New York home for children. His conception is the result of a romantic evening involving a classically trained musician  Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connolly, an Irish born member of  Celtic musical group (Jonathan Rhys Myers). Due to tragic and cruel circumstances, the young Evan is placed up for adoption but never seems to find a family. After being bullied at the home, Evan sets out to find his parents, believing that the music will guide him and the most of the film revolves around his journey.

Critics are correct in stating that the story is far fetched, and there are quite a few gaps and questions that remain unanswered, but this is the case with many movies, and we still love them, the reason being the actors make the film convincing and we tend to ignore the flaws. The reason AUGUST RUSH works is due to the wonderful performances of the actors, particularly the young Freddie Highmore. His performance is so appealing, we hope for the bets for the young man, knowing all the while that the film will have a happy ending. We also feel for Keri Russell's Lyla and Rhys Meyer's Louis Connolly is an all around good guy as well. Robin Williams' character ""Wizard"" is a bit creepy and a bit too one dimensional, to Williams' credit he does do his bets to bring the character to life. Another notable performer in the film is Leon Thomas III who plays Arthur, a gifted child performer living on the street who rescues the young Evan while unknowingly placing him in danger.

In many ways, AUGUST RUSH has a number of similarities to OLIVER TWIST (the novel more so than the musical film OLIVER!), Evan being similar to the innocent Oliver Twist, Wizard being similar to Fagin ,an d Arthur, a street child similar to The Artful Dodger, and some of the challenges the young Evan faces are Dickensian-like. Yet just as readers root for Oliver and want the best for him, the same holds true for the young Evan. We watch the film, hope for the best, and cheer for him all the way.",1217116800,,2524,4.502183406113537

3350014,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Evan Taylor is an orphan who knows his parents are out there looking for him. He hears music in everything. He is convinced that if he can play music, his parents will find him.

Evan's father, an Irish musician met Evan's mother, a cello player in a chance encounter. His mother, Lyla is told that her baby has died. His father, Louis was unaware that there ever was a child. Louis and Lyla long for each other. They both give up their music and can't find true happiness.

Evan runs away from the orphanage, saying he is following the music. He goes home with a street musician about his age, who plays for donations. Evan finds himself in a run down theatre, living with many other runaways. The leader, a man called the Wizard, discovers Evans talents, and gives him the choice spot as a street performer. He also names him August Rush, which sounds more like a performer's name.

August Rush follows the music he hears and walks into a church with a choir practicing. Evan can play the piano on his first try. His music leads him to perform his own symphany, in Central Park. August Rush is sure that if his music can be presented to a larger audience he will find his parents.

This is a sweet and happy film. The music is delightful. You will find yourself anxiously hoping for Evan to find his parents. You will also long for Lyla and Louis, who have both turned back to their music after eleven years, to find each other again.

I highly recommend this movie for children and adults. I have seen it two times and hope to watch it again. There are very few movies I will watch twice.

3350015,5,B0013K7ZUE,"This has to be one of the best movies I've seen that ties the connection that music makes to human emotion. Not only is the music inspired, but the performers are especially convincing. Jonathon Rhys Meyers has an amazing voice, Keri Russell, while not really 'playing' the cello has obviously studied well for this role, as her handing of the instrument and the body language she projects are passionate and convincing. Then there's Freddie Highmore, clearly the star of the movie. How does a kid of his age access such depth within himself to play a child prodigy with so much conviction and enthusiasm? Beats me, but he was a joy to watch in every scene.

The added bonus here, and for me the thing that catapults this movie to greatness, is the spiritual connections made throughout. They are made in several subtle ways, but those who are especially attuned to that sort of thing will find plenty of inspiration.",1216598400,,917,4.73125

His two passions in life are music and finding his parents, whom he is convinced are looking for him.  His parents are actually unaware that he is alive, since his father never knew of his existence and his mother was separated from him by birth, falsely told that he was dead.  Not surprisingly his mother is a concert cellist and his father is a singer and guitar player.  When Evan runs away from the orphanage, he is taken under the wing of a street hustler (Robin Williams) who gives him a guitar and begins his musical career.  There are lots of things in the movie that are very implausible, but this doesn't detract from a lovely story which is a real tearjerker and very satisfying viewing.",1216339200,,776,4.514285714285714

3350020,5,B0013K7ZUE,"'August Rush' is, as best, hard to describe. It's not a musical, but it's a movie about music, where music forms the emotional backbone of the story. It's not a fantasy, but the story it tells has elements that can only be described as fantastic. It's not a 'family film' is the traditional sense, though it is a movie the the whole family can watch, enjoy, and appreciate on many levels.

'August Rush' tells the story of a young boy, conceived on a magical night between a pair of star-crossed lovers who seem to be fated never to meet again, and given up as an orphan at birth. Despite his hard life, the boy has a faith that is challenged at every turn. It is not a faith in a God or gods, not even a faith that his parents will find hom someday. What this boy believes in more than anything is a force that shapes his life and the story he tells us: he believes in music.

The boy's faith leads him to a story which is nothing less than magical. It leads him to New York, to discover his own talent for music, to new friends, to people who would use what he brings for their own ends, to those who actually care for him.  His belief and his ability and his determination lead him to hear the music all around him, and to express it in his own way.

'August Rush' tells a story that isn't heard very often today, a story of hope and belief and music and the simple ways that magic can be a part of our lives. Like any good fairy tale, 'August Rush' cracks open a door to simple magic and wonder, and invites us to walk through.

""All you have to do...is listen.""",1215302400,,1566,4.1551155115511555
3350021,5,B0013K7ZUE,"It's easy to point out the incongruities of Kirsten Sheridan's magical ""August Rush""...an 11-year-old who learns guitar in one night, and piano and musical composition in another...but this is not a movie for nitpickers, but for dreamers, and all of us who hear music in everything we experience. And boy, does this film deliver!

I wasn't surprised to see Nick Castle's hand in the screenplay, as he is an old hand at finding magic in our cynical world (he wrote and directed ""The Boy Who Could Fly""); here, we have the story of two incredibly gifted musicians, a Julliard-trained cellist (Keri Russell), and a self-taught Irish rock singer/composer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who bond under the stars in New York City, then are torn apart by families with their own agendas. She carries his child, but after an accident, her ambitious father (William Sadler) steals the newborn, dumps the baby into social services, and announces to the daughter that the child had died. What is MEANT to be, never happens, the lives of both musicians unravel, and they soon give up their gifts, for mundane careers...as their unknown child (the remarkable Freddie Highmore) grows into a musical prodigy, on a mission to find them.

The bulk of the film deals with the child's search, and the remarkable people he meets along the way, from a sympathetic welfare worker (Terrence Howard), to a gifted child guitarist and his Fagin-like mentor (Leon Thomas III and Robin Williams, who is creepy, but excellent), and finally, a powerful child gospel singer, and her pastor (Jamia Simone Nash and Mykelti Williamson). Dubbed 'August Rush' by Williams, the boy harnesses his prodigious musical talents, even as his parents individually renew their own musical careers, and are drawn back to New York City, and a tear-inducing, spectacular climax. Predictable? You bet, but I dare you not to be moved, anyway!

The performances are first-rate, particularly from the child actors, and the music is awesome. This is unabashedly a 'feel-good' movie, the perfect flick to pop into the DVD player when you're feeling down.

My only real quibble is the lack of Special Features; extended scenes are all that are offered, and this is a film I'd have loved learning more about...

""August Rush"" is a wonderful film that shouldn't be missed!",1215302400,,2308,5.015665796344647

3350024,4,B0013K7ZUE,"The previous reviews relating the plot and very strong cast are excellent and I agree with them.  I had to let my ""inner child"" take over at the contrived ending which was totally unbelievable but, who cares?  Watching it made you feel terrific - just turn your intellect off for a few minutes.  I would give this movie 5 stars for the entire movie, save the conclusion which was unbelievable but still moving.  I rented it on demand and will buy to add to my collection of other ""feel good"" movies.  This is one to keep and great for the entire family.  I think children would really enjoy it as well.  I felt it conveyed the way we musicians feel and ""hear"" music - or unfortunately for many people - who don't.  Studies have shown that our brains are ""hard wired"" for music appreciation and this film certainly shows that beautifully.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who has ever loved a piece of music and wants an escape from our daily drudge even if you must suspend belief.  As an opera lover, I do that all the time!  This film makes it very easy to do!  To see it and hear it - is to love it.",1215043200,,1110,4.258373205741627
3350025,5,B0013K7ZUE,"A young boy (Freddie Highmore) growing up in an orphanage dreams of being found by his parents and survives by his innate gift for and love of music. When he runs away to New York to find them, he takes up with a group of kid street musicians led by the sometimes nurturing, sometimes dangerous, and always exploitative Wizard (Robin Williams). Under Wizard's guidance, the boy takes on the name August Rush, and while in New York he hones his skills at a genius's pace in the hopes that his long lost parents will follow the music to find him. Meanwhile, only just discovering that her son did not die at birth, August's mother (Keri Russell) is already on the search with the help of a caring social worker (Terence Howard), while August's father (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is seeking to find her, the lost love he has never forgotten.

When I first saw trailers for ""August Rush"", I had no idea that it was based on ""Oliver Twist"", something that quickly became obvious when watching it. However, I also underestimated how touching it would be, and that's even though I expected it to be very good from the get-go. Regardless of the fact that its story is predictable (if you know Oliver Twist at all) and slightly sappy (not as sappy as I was afraid it might be, though), this is one heck of a movie! It'll bring you to tears a lot. In fact, it'll send you up and down throughout as you root for August and his family to finally come together. But what makes this one so different than just being a modern-day Oliver Twist is the fact that August Rush is a musical prodigy, and this is well woven into the story and a huge part of it. It's significant enough to make the film as much about the love and magic of music as it is about modernizing a classic. So, don't be put off by the fact that the tale is an old one. The brilliant cast, music, and engaging story will soon have you forgetting that you're on a journey you've been through before.

The DVD is double-sided for widescreen and fullscreen and comes with a selection of deleted scenes as the only bonus features. Definitely a must-see, and for many, a must-own.",1214870400,,2123,4.441025641025641
3350026,4,B0013K7ZUE,"The first half hour of this movie is ridiculously slow.  I must admit that the first time I saw this movie, I was very bored at first.  And, the love story clich is nothing original.  ""Oh noes, my rockstar boyfriend is gone!!""  Seen it all before.

But, honestly, I got something much different out of this movie than most people seem to have gotten.  While other people seem to be focused on the love story, or that August is a musical prodigy, or that he is bound and determined to find his parents, or what have you, all of that seemed secondary to me.  To me, the real story is how music affects us all, no matter who we are or what kind of music we make.  August's dad is a guitarist and a rock singer who quits his music only to return later, because his life is incomplete without it.  His mother is a classically trained cellist who becomes a music teacher as well as a performer.  Wizard turns to music as a means to an end (teaching the children to play so they can make money for him) and as a source of comfort (playing the harmonica when he loses his best student).  All of the professors at Julliard are moved by the music that August creates.  Is music not the real star of this movie?  Freddie Highmore's character is just a facilitator.  Music the true star here.  Thus, I give this movie 4 stars.",1214697600,,1314,4.2631578947368425

3350029,4,B0013K7ZUE,"I rented this film first, watched it, adored the musicality of it, and then promptly ordered it (so much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores). Yes, it is a modern ""adaptation"" of OLIVER TWIST. Yes, Robin Williams' character of Wizard is creepy beyond belief (for a better dark portrayal, check out his anarchist character on a late episode of Law & Order: SVU from this past season-it ran in April/May). Yes, the characters of Lyla and Louis don't age in 10 years (how old are they supposed to be when they meet? 18, 20? Who knows?). I say all of these things to state that although we KNOW these things are highly unlikely to happen, that doesn't take away from the message of the film.

I enjoyed the sweeping view of NYC and it's outlying suburbs, all of the kid's inherent musical genius, and the universal THEME of wanting to belong to someone or something (in August/Evan's case, his family).

I knocked off 1 star because I thought Keri Russell could've shined a bit more and shown more range as Lyla Novacek. Also, I didn't see a need for Terrence Howard's social worker. Anyone could've played that part ably (perhaps I'm biased, but I haven't liked anything Howard's done since ""The Best Man""). Jonathan Rhys Meyers was a revelation as Louis Connelly though. What a talent (singing and acting)! The look that he gives August/Evan in the park after playing ""Dueling Guitars"" is so fraught with emotion-he knows this kid is special; he just can't put his finger on WHY.

The ending could've been extended a bit, and the DVD is short on special features (nothing at ALL about how the music came together for the film-what a shame since it's such an integral part of the movie). Overall I give it a 4-star effort. A great family film.",1214265600,,1741,4.609677419354838

This movie was pure entertainment, not intended to do more than that, and in this day and age, with all the stresses we all face, entertainment and fun is quite useful.  Sure the story line was a bit hokey, and the little boy's playing of the guitar was not for real, but the music was just plain fantastic.  Sent chills up and down my spine the first time he picked up that guitar.

Far too often, movies are pure trash, full of sex, nudity, virtual intercourse, blood, violence, pure filthy language, denigration of various ethnic groups, genders, etc., obviously thrown together for the sole purpose of making a quick buck.

The feelings this kid faces in the movie are faced by many children on a daily basis in our country: Why did they leave me?, Did my parents want me?, Will I ever find them?, If I move to a family or to another home will they find me if they look for me?... etc. Having a fantasy belief that their real parents will come back is one reason why many children resist adoption and try disrupting placements.

The story plot is portrayed in a believable series of events and Robin Williams also does a good job portraying the semi-villain in this movie. This is a bit of a tear-jerker but pleasant none-the-less and with the inevitable happy ending.,1211241600,,315,4.962264150943396
3350051,1,B0013K7ZUE,"I didn't really want to watch this movie to begin with, and sure enough, it was horrible.  First of all, I believe the child was insane.  It's basically a twisted musical version of Oliver Twist. It's one of the strangest musical movies ever! something I care nothing about. It was infuriating how the boy kept missing his parents by just a little. Also, NOT RECCOMENDED FOR SMALLER CHILDREN, his ""parents"" got him doing something well, um,.........sexual. Half the movie was flash-backs and I do think they did them well, It's sooo easy to make flashbacks confusing.  All, in all, strange dumb movie; do not listen to all the other 5 star reviews, I hated it.",1211155200,,660,4.721739130434782
3350052,1,B0013K7ZUE,"If you just open yourself to the music, you can pick up a guitar for the first time and within two minutes be an expert.  And within a few weeks, you will not only know the definition of the word rhapsody, you will be conducting an orchestra representing Julliard in Central Park to perform a rhapsody YOU wrote for thousands of awed listeners.  If you have a gift, it really requires absolutely no work.  You will just be good automatically.  You writing this down kids?  Make sure you tell this to your teachers when you tell them you haven't done your homework.  You are GIFTED...you don't need to do any work.
And you know what else?  If you are talented, good looking, cool, and perhaps have a little tortured soul thrown in, you can sit on a rooftop, meet a gorgeous female, tell her your name along with some ridiculously cheesy lines, and immediately have ""marital relations"" with her...and everything will turn out great in the end.
Great fun for the entire family!!!  Hooray!

So many disbelievable occurances happened in this farce of a film, but I think I should name one more.  Lyla's father signed away the baby, forging her name, which in itself is nearly impossible.  A doctor would have to witness her signing the papers.  But beyond that, does anyone realize how long the line is to adopt an infant in this country?  It's staggering.  So why was Evan still a ward of the state at 11 years of age?  Baloney...he would have been in the arms of a caring mother and father from day 1. Asking us to suspend our belief is one thing, but this film asked us to be idiots.

Oh, I must admit one of my shortcomings here. When Even (aka August)was fleeing from Wizard in the subway and his buddy, Arthur, yelled to him ""Run August Run"", I did not stand and immediately throw rotten food at the screen.  I really should have.

And if Freddy Highmore's agent is reading this....you should be fired for letting your client star in this joke of a film.  This film has ""career killer"" written all over it.  Kerri Russell is old enough to know better.  What was she thinking?",1211155200,,2076,4.497326203208556

3350062,4,B0013K7ZUE,"This was a great movie... that is, if you like movies that fall into your comfort zones.  And I do... sometimes.  To be honest, I'm generally more a fan of action, horror, teen comedy, etc.  So ""August Rush"" does not fit into my ideal of a good movie (and, for examples, I consider movies like The Dark Knight, Blade, Underworld, Oh Brother Where Art Thou, Friday the 13th, and American Pie great movies).  However, this movie was good as far as being a feel-good movie.  I have been stressed out, sick, and just generally sad over the past couple months, so this movie helped to lift my spirits quite a bit.

Admittedly, it is unrealistic and the plot depends wholly and completely on tons of deux et machinas.  Everything that happens just happens.  The father of the boy is never actually told that he is Evan's (August) father.  And until that concert in the park, the boy doesn't know that either of them are his parents, and yet he does know (what?).  The timeline of 11 years also does not help to make it realistic.

What this movie is trying to get across is that the boy is drawn by the music.  As a musician myself, I can relate to this sentiment.  It is true that music is out there, everywhere, and it controls those of us who listen.  The following line from Led Zeppelin's ""Houses of the Holy"" says it best:
""Let the music be your master.  Will you heed the master's call?""
That is the idea this movie tried to get across, and it's effort was good, if rushed and unbelievable.

Finally, I think this would have been much better as a novel.  At least, as a novel, there'd be much more room to explain much of what seemed like well-planned coincidences and serious and obvious deux et machinas.

So why do I give this movie 4 stars?  Because it is uplifting, helped me feel better, and it is a Comfort-Zone Bullseye.",1209945600,,1829,4.422155688622754
3350063,3,B0013K7ZUE,"I really struggled with the rating scale on this one, so I'll break it down a little this time.

Music: Outstanding.  Easily a 5/5.  Or maybe a 6/5.

Cast: Perfect.  5/5. Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers portray their characters quite nicely.  Freddie Highmore does an excellent job as ""August Rush"" but I have to say that Jamia Simone Nash stole the show with her larger than life voice (and the fact that she's just adorable). Robin Williams did a nice job in his role, however I didn't enjoy his character (see plot below).

Plot: 2/5. The one night stand on top of a building in the middle of the night with two people that didn't even know each other made it hard to feel a strong connection or desire to see them reunite more than eleven years later.  The creepy ""pimp"" character (Williams) was more than a little disturbing in my opinion, especially when he controlled a bunch of young children. Also I had a big problem with how the last scene of the movie played out. I do not wish to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see the movie, but the logistics of the entire ending scene I thought to be pretty outlandish even for a ""fairy tale"" movie.

Message: 4/5. Music transcending boundaries, not losing faith despite obstacles or disappointment, lamenting the fact that you weren't a child music prodigy...

Overall enjoyable. You've got to have a little appreciation for music in order to really like this one, as well as a little imagination and ability to overlook some of the outlandish portions of the plot.",1209859200,,1525,4.573529411764706

The movie is one of a kind with an original plot, great actors (the kid is amazing) and even if you don't like the story (which in my opinion is beautiful) it is all worth it just to hear the music... It should go for the oscar for best soundtrack wow. On the purchase there's no much to say since amazon's service has always been excellent on timing and quality of the products.

The way the movie catapolted you into it felt a lot like Mr. Hollands Opus. Know one could not be cheering for the character at the movie's end. His love of music was insperational and driven. We have recommened it to several family friends and have borrowed ours out as well.  Why it did not do better at the box office is beyond me.

Overall I found it hard to suspend disbelief enough to really enjoy this movie. The story is WAY out there, so I took solace in the amazing soundtrack that Kaki King contributed to (the guitarist behind August's unique style).

This movie was made ridiculous in my mind (after all the previous cheese) when visually the piano keys went up in 3rds, and the notes played went down in steps. It was only a second, but it was up close and as a pianist I definitely took notice and it was hard to overlook. ""C'MON, SERIOUSLY?!""

Despite everything, it's a movie I haven't been able to get out of my head since, and I'd love for my kids to watch it someday.  (Hopefully the fact that it's on HD DVD won't deter them!)",1208908800,,832,4.286624203821656

Before you know it, this kid can play every instrument in the universe, he is accepted at Juliard and composes a symphony for the Cetral Park public performance.  And of course, it all ends up happy.  There is no focus to this movie since it wants to cover too much.  Story may be good for a book but it is too unbelievable for the movie.

If you saw that, this isn't quite that bad. I found myself sitting there saying ""they're not going to..."" and they always did. Seriously embarassing with some terrific music and terrific actors. Blame the script and the Director. Oh, and someone explain to me how Loren Mazel taught this kid to direct. The kid did a great job faking the guitar he couldn't play, but the conducting was beyond terrible. Walk outside and stare at a brick wall.

On the plus side, the photography was nice, and the theme of orphaned boy finally uniting with his parents is nice.

On the down side, there was not enough of the classical side of music for me.  Further, the Irish accent of the father was hard to understand.  Overall the plot development seems too unrealistic, not that we all like fantasy now and then, but for some reason, this frustrated me in this film, and I haven't yet been able to articulate it.  Maybe the characters therefore weren't that believable?

Compare this with Sandy Bottom Orchestra and too me, there is no comparison.  I can watch this once or twice a month and never tire.  I will not give August Rush another viewing.  The difference between a five star and three star.",1207872000,,916,4.496969696969697

My wife liked the movie, but she's the one that likes all the sappy heartwarmers. I found this movie unbelievable. It reminded me of all those movies with computer scenes from the 80s like Weird Science where the character create a beutiful women just feeding the computer with pictures from different magazines. I suppose was interesting for those who knew nothing about computers in those days, like me.
Now, back to the movie, perhaps the most shocking part of this film was that Robin Williams plays the villain? Come on!..give me a break!..is actually difficult to hate this guy, is like Pee Wee Herman playing the role of a serial killer?
Anyhow, no one I know can learn the guitar in less than a minute and be enrolled in the Juilliard School in practically the same amount of time. You can not play a guitar by just slapping it. Not only that, but playing the organ the way he does the first time? give me another break! The kid also doesn't know how to conduct an orchestra.
Taking the movie for what it is, it will leave you with a warmed heart, and a new awareness of the music all around you.
Two out of five stars for Freddie's good job as a young actor, other than that everything was fairly disappointing. Most of the movie is pretty good, but the end is totally unrealistic. These two lovers hadn't seen each other for 11 years, and when they do, they hold hands and smile at each other. Thats it?.. no ""Oh my god I've finally found you!"" or..""I missed you so much!""..or maybe at least a  ""Oh hey, what's up?."" again, totally overrated.

HOWEVER, the story was nothing more than warm, fuzzy, fluff.  There were a lot of 'gaps' in the story and the realism was pretty lacking.  I understand this wasn't intended to be a documentary or anything like that, and I wasn't looking for spoon-fed information, I was simply disappointed with the 'movie' as a whole.  The acting side of things was pretty tragic.  Robin Williams was good, in a disturbing way (due to the character), but the storyline and 'depth' in the other characters was pretty shallow.

3350116,4,B0013K7ZUE,"A great family film. It only misses a 5 star rating because of some small confusions... like the need to listen very carefully to be aware of the passage of time. ie. Months pass when August is at Julliard and in the clutches of Wizard. You need to be aware of that. While the guitar playing seems to develop extremely quickly, again we must be aware of the passage of time and that the techniques employed are reasonable quick to learn when using DADGAD tunings. (Perhaps the biggest annoyance was seeing him play piano notes going in reverse to the actual sounds.) There are also 2 deleted scenes that might have been better restored - for understanding - even if it extended the length of the movie. 1. The scene where his mother goes to the orphanage and meets his friend. 2. The scene, underground, where Wizard realises that he has to let him go. All that being so, this is still a 'feelgood' movie where, like a fantasy, one has to suspend reality a little. And it is not beyond reality that perhaps a little 'Mozart-type' prodigy would absorb musical knowledge as quickly as the film suggests. (I have tutored musicians who have developed 10 years ability inside 2 years.) For a similar type story see 'Vitus' - in that film the playing is 'real'.... not faked!

That doesn't take anything away from the movie-you just have to turn off the rational part of your brain and enjoy the movie for what it is, a very entertaining story. The two 'hook up' afterwards at a party for a one night stand in which Lyla gets pregnant. Flash forward to Evan, an 11 year old boy living in a New York orphanage who is teased by the others because he hears music in his head which he believes is his mother & father calling him. Afraid of being adopted or sent to a foster home, he runs away to try and find his parents.

3350125,1,B0013K7ZUE,"I don't know where you were when you saw this, but I was trapped on a plane and almost hypnotized by how deeply rotten to the core it is. The term ""fairy tale"" keeps getting applied to this film, but real fairy tales are carefully crafted allegories, not excuses for insipid and unbelievable storytelling. To say that it is just overly sentimental is also far too kind because this kind of ""product"" is, of course, the result of multiple test-screenings and demographic considerations. In fact, if ever a movie wanted to pander and please every possible viewer / paying unit, it is this one. Stretched beyond thin, it is as if it was robotically assembled; ""pull heart-string A, add sweeping music, insert flashback B (in slow motion), etc."" And it STILL manages to sink even lower with yet another one-dimensional portrayal of a human, as caricatured by Robin Williams (who is as naturally ""street"" as Kathy Lee Gifford)!

Most offensive, however, is that ""August Rush"" ultimately purports to be about the universality and power of art as a mysterious and yet uniquely human language. Yet in it's air-tight bubble of calculated cliches and manipulative schmaltz, it has completely suffocated the very elements that allow for true art to exist. There is no better example of this than in how the film repeatedly illustrates the boy's relationship to music. In the very opening scenes, the director has chosen an internal voice-over to verbally explain how August feels about music in his world, rather than employ the almost limitless language of cinema to creatively show it. Oh, we get lots of sweeping MTV crane and helicopter shots, but this is not what I'm getting at. In this opening voice-over, August explains how music and rhythm is present in almost every facet of nature itself. It's hardly a new idea, but a potentially challenging and beautiful one to consider. Still, the filmmakers won't allow you to actually experience or engage with this philosophy first-hand, which they could have. Instead, for every visual example they provide; the wind, the birds, the urban environment, etc., they have chosen to lay ACTUAL music over, drowning out whatever discoveries you might have shared with August for yourself.

This film has nothing to do with art, or even human beings, really. It's a total betrayal of its subject matter and mistrusts its audience on every level. It offers no challenges or discoveries and, without these, there can be no fairy tales, only mounting successions of highly improbable coincidences, delivered D.O.A., in a pantomime of wonder. Anything by Ed Wood was more heart-felt than this!",1207094400,,2624,5.01605504587156
3350126,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Just like the baseball movie, this is about risk, confidence, and ultimately -- the concept of simply having faith. Being a musician helps -- knowing how music can flow through you; be part of who you are; change your perception of life. After this film I had tears streaming down my face -- as much for the movie experience as for those who will just never ""get"" this film. If you are a person who has no faith -- in anything, anyone or in a higher power, you will either hate this movie or be challenged to the max. Ask yourself -- is there anything you believe in enough to cast it all aside on faith? In this film, all three main characters did just that.",1207008000,,659,4.238095238095238
3350127,3,B0013K7ZUE,"Whether or not the implausible plot of director Kirsten Sheridan's 2007 ""August Rush"" makes much sense or not, the film moves with its own frenetic momentum; the urgent momentum of the music heard inside the head of its main character Evan Taylor a.k.a. August Rush (played by the serious Freddie Highmore of ""Finding Neverland""), musical genius extraordinaire of the caliber of a latter-day Amadeus Mozart.

Ordinary sounds like that of the grass blowing in the breeze and the wind hitting an old brass wind chime filter through this child's brain and transform to melodies of symphonic perfection.  From the first few opening frames of the film, there is no doubt in the mind of the viewer that Evan definitely possesses that quirky quality akin to all masterminds, be it the mathematical autistic savant speaking in logarithms or yet another John Nash hearing aliens speak to him through glimpses of magazine and newspaper text.  Through almost monotonous repetition, Sheridan insures that the audience immerses itself in sensing yet not fully understanding this wondrous creative treat--how often do we get to explore the mind of someone of higher perceptive powers?

Making use of his unique gift, Evan, living in a home for boys, decides that hearing his personal compositions will provide the means to bring his parents to him in a lyrical happy-ever-after.  We hear his music too (thanks to Mark Mancina's soundtrack) and like the fairytale rats of Hamlin follow this Pied Piper to the streets of New York City where Evan becomes synonymous with Dicken's Oliver Twist complete with an acoustic guitar toting Artful Dodger and somewhat manic-prone-to-violence Fagan (a cowboy hat wearing mutton-chopped Robin Williams.)

As Evan wanders through the arch in Washington Square and the abandoned Filmore East Theatre in pursuit of his music, we flash back and forth from the moment of his conception by rock star Louis (the ever intense Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and classical cellist Lyla (America's sweetheart Keri Russell.) Separated by factions that again seem conjured from a world replete with evil stepmothers, the two live their floundering lives in different cities fully conscious of the black hole created by their estranged existences.

As Evan's musical ability purrs into a startling fifth gear, the trio moves steadily towards each other like a convergence of heavenly bodies in the night sky in a somewhat wannabe facsimile of a Christmas miracle exemplified with a hopeful magical star. ZZZZzzzzzzz . . .

Bottom line?  Although ""August Rush"" assembles a fine group of actors to play out one boy's musical rhapsody with all the trimmings, the overall presentation seems overly slick--dusted with a coating of improbable sweetness that may work for family fare if a double dose of sugar is in order but does not contain enough real poignancy to satisfy an adult viewer.  Instead, the film mirrors a tale out of Dickens with all the convenient serendipity and none of the genuine menace to elicit human response or concern.  Highmore pours on the spacey-ness with an almost beatific grin and glow that the best of the litany of saints cannot duplicate while Russell and Rhys Meyers come together with a too-perfect simplicity that moves like a sticky snowball at the light speed of the music.  Williams plays this one too over the top for me--he tries for three dimensional when only one is needed.  Recommended for those who like sweet predictable fairytales.

3350138,2,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is a heart-warming, albeit painfully slow at times, story of an orphan boy - a pseudo-Oliver Twist - named Evan Tayler who is the definition of a socially awkward child.  While walking around the streets of New York he meets a wise talking, Boondocks-esque musical prodigy named Arthur who leads him to a group of other musical prodigies.  Evan is escaping from the life of social custody, and following the music in his ears has led him to this unlikely family of vagrant musicians, each with their own speciality (I think I saw a didgeradoo at one point).

These kids are living in an abandoned playhouse, and under the tutelage of a ghetto pied piper named Wizard (Robin Williams) who musically pimps all of the gifted youngsters under his watch.  And, wouldn't you know it, young Evan is a friggin guitar genius; so, he fits in quite well.  In no time at all he usurps Arthur for the Alpha position in the drifter family, and the prefered musical prostitute bringing in cash to Wizard - the musical, philosophical pimp who will do anything to keep his new found meal ticket.

(Yes, you read all of that right, and it's just as ridiculously unbelieveable as I have mentioned.  It's ""Ben Affleck saving the world in Armaggedon""-ridiculous.)

Meanwhile, we find out that Lila and Louis, both socially awkward musicians in their twenties, meet randomly one night at a lame party.  Louis is a guitarist for a somewhat popular band, and he doesn't seem to like crowds.  Yeah, a guitarist who doesn't like crowds.  Lila plays classical music, and the two have a incredibly pointless, random night together - sort of a poor man's Serendipity - and then they part ways the next morning.

Oops, he knocked her up.  Nevermind, it didn't happen.  Oh wait, yeah it did, but the father forged her signature up and gave the baby up for adoption.  (I only put it this way because this is the manner in which the movie gave these facts to the viewer)

In the end, Lila and Louis discover that Evan is their kid, and he is now a successful composer named August Rush who has attended Juilliard and is about to have his own symphony in Central Park...at eleven years old...where his mother just happens to be playing the cello after an 11-year hiatus...and the father just happens to be driving by after playing a gig during his recent refound love of music.  The entire ordeal is done with more foreshadowing and preposterousness than Dolly Parton walking around the corner.  Amongst all the barely connected storylines, they are all reunited happily ever after...despite the eleven year separation.

It's a feel-good movie great for the whole family, and by feel-good I mean completely unbelievable. And by completely unbelievable, I mean there's more realism in Starship Troopers.",1206489600,,2780,4.802521008403361

3350140,4,B0013K7ZUE,"I really liked a lot about this picture - the music is lovely, and I  enjoyed the way that the soundtrack sort of put you inside our young hero's head - you can start to hear the music in a siren or a windchime or a pair of feet walking on wet pavement.  I also really enjoyed the fact that this film's universe isn't violent or cruel.  What a relief after the mean and vicious characters we've had to pay money to watch in other pictures this past season!  And I really like young Freddie Highmore.  It's good to see him in a picture where he's able to shine on center stage.

As to the plot, the similarities to ""Oliver Twist"" are too many to go un-noticed.  A young street musician plays the role of the Artful Dodger, bringing Our Hero back to an abandoned theater swarming with orphaned street kids.  The gang is headed up by a slimey, Fagin-esque Robin Williams, to whom the kids give the money they earn as street buskers.  Instead of a sympathetic magistrate, we have sympathetic social worker and a sympathetic minister of the gospel.

As in the Dickens novel, our young hero gets a taste of the good life at the Julliard School of Music, but Fagin (oops, Williams as ""The Wizard"") is tipped off by the Dodger, and drags our hero back into the street life.  Everything works out in a happy ending, though, and Oliver (oops, August) is happily re-united with his family.

I guess what keeps this from being 5 stars for me is just the blatantness of the story-lifting, and the predictability of it from that point of view.  I really did enjoy the picture, though, and I think it's a wonderful break from the ""gritty"" messes we're so often served up.",1206403200,,1656,4.425742574257426

Evan (Highmore) was separated from his mother at birth and sent to live in a boys' home.  He is considered a freak because he hears music in everything and believes his parents will come for him.  He runs away and finally finds a way to put what he hears in his head on paper, and later on show, hoping two certain audience members will be listening.  The music is the high point, as well as Highmore, Russell, and Rhys Meyers.  I highly recommend the soundtrack as well.

3350144,1,B0013K7ZUE,"This film has been widely classified as ""a fairy tale"" for our times. But a fairy tale, as Bruno Bettleheim pointed out long ago, contains gritty elements of psychological realism and represents symbolically through its ogres and witches the dangers which all children confront on the road to maturity.

""August Rush,"" on the other hand is just an indulgent exercise in New Age Wish Fulfillment. It could more accurately be classified not as a fairy tale but, to put it mildly, as ""a vast betrayal of life."" Consider in this regard its opening. A rock musician scores after a first meeting with a classical cellist on the rooftop of a Greenwich Village flat. She learns after their one-night-stand that she's pregnant. Naturally, these two individuals of low responsibility, separated after their only encounter by a controlling Hollywood-type parent, continue to hunger for each over an eleven year period. Yeah, right! Similarly, the controlling parent allows his erring daughter to bear the child, but then forges her signature to give it up for adoption. Shades of pleasing everybody, ""Juno"" or ""Murphy Brown"" style. Out of wedlock liasons are given a pass, so as to be thought daring, but pregnancies are then carried to term, so as not to the offend the pro-life section of the audience. This is once again the Hollywood mentality, trying to have things both ways, beginning with the seemingly daring, but landing on a very neat, conventional trajectory.

The film, sad to say, goes from bed to worse. Children, I'm sure, would quickly see through its escalating preposterousness. Some weak-minded adults, on the other hand, interested in instant uplift, might be inclined to find it ""spiritual"" and ""exhilarating."" As Oscar Wilde said in another context, ""only a man without a heart"" could fail to laugh at the trials and tribulations of the characters in ""August Rush.""

The only bearable performance, for my money, is that of Freddie Highmore, a talented child actor. Unfortunately, however, he may be finding himself, like Haley Joel Osment earlier, pushed into bad roles that undermine his ostensible skills. ""August Rush,"" I'd argue, is Freddie Highmore's ""Pay It Forward."" One hopes he or his agents exercise a better choice over scripts in the future. The worst performance in the film, not surprisingly, comes from Robin Williams, who became an act rather than an actor in ""Good Will Hunting,"" and has yet to recover. Just like Dustin Hoffman in recent roles, he's here playing yet another caricature of a weirdo to diminishing effect. The one star is for Freddie Highmore.",1206144000,,2588,5.070422535211268

3350146,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Have you ever watched a movie that left you simply speechless and fulfilled? Well, August Rush left me feeling that way! I vaguely remember when this movie was released, and not hearing a thing out it. But when it was released on DVD, I said ""what the heck, give it a try"". It was surprisingly, one of the best, well written and well thought out movies that I have read in a long time. I simply loved the story, the acting, the music...everything.

Evan (AKA August Rush) was always sure about two things in life, (1) he heard music in everything, and (2) his parents were looking for him! Starting with vivid imagery and personal narrative, Evan describes how he feels about his life and music, while always feeling different from everyone else. As he begins his personal journey, we see how truly special he is. We soon learn the story behind his birth (one night of passion between two musicians, Louis and Lyla), and how he was eventually put up for adoption, by Lyla's very over protective father, who thinks it is in her best interest. Escaping his group home and ""following the music"", Evan has a series of misadventures as others discover his genius. During his journey, Evan never gives up faith that he will find his parents. And while some try to use Evan (the Wizard, played by Robin Williams), some try to help him (Terrance Howard), some try to find him (Lyla), some befriend him (two lovable and equally talented kids) and some discover him (his unbeknowest father, Louis).

Since so many others have reviewed this movie, I won't say too much more except to watch this movie. You will smile, cry and laugh. It will leave you with a feeling of hope!",1206144000,,1663,4.595959595959596
3350147,5,B0013K7ZUE,"So, why another glowing review.  Everything has been said in the 60+ reviews already on this page and mine will likely never even be read!

Why? Because this movie engages the senses (an amazing score, lush cinematography) and touches the heart from start to finish in ways quite unexpected and rare for films these days. It's a stunner and it makes you want to stand up and clap with joy, (or go on record on Amazon with an enthusiastic review!!)

It is a beautiful fable, a metaphor for a deep and abiding truth that we are all interconnected and can 'listen' and 'hear' the harmonic of love that connects us.  The talented young actor who carries this film (Freddie Highmore) expresses the purity, innocence, and sense of wonder that lies within each of us -- evoked so beautifully in this timeless fable of 'yearning for Home' and 'dreams come true.' And any viewer (of any age - even the most jaded and cynical, I promise you) can relate to this universal theme and (perhaps in spite of oneself) feel uplifted.

This simple little film is a beauty.  It is more than the sum of its parts.  See this film, please!  You'll skip with a lighter step if you do.",1206144000,,1160,4.516746411483253
3350148,5,B0013K7ZUE,"If you have any love for music at all, you'll enjoy this movie.  There's a language that goes along with music...it makes the sounds that the soul wants to speak but can't find words for.  It sings of celebration, joy, hurt, anguish...and other depths of emotion that we can't even begin to explain.  This movie does a wonderful job of expressing that.

As a musician, I actually ached inside watching it because I understood what August heard in the world.  His musical pureness was exquisite.  He didn't understand the capitalist edge he had that Wizard tried to exploit because of his gift.  He didn't understand the importance and grandeur of his accomplishment at Juliard.  He simply heard the music and knew in his heart that it would serve him good in mending the broken relationships of his life.  That is the essence of music...touching the areas of life that otherwise would not be reached.

If you watch this movie with just your eyes, you may not be as delighted with it.  But watch it with your heart and you won't be able to help but stand and cheer!",1206057600,,1064,4.6063829787234045

3350151,3,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush would probably be considered an interesting film for most, but a fascinating film for music lovers.  A somewhat whimsical tale of a gifted child that never knew his parents.  Gifted in that the child hears music all around him, calling to him, almost begging to be recorded and played for others to enjoy.  Never knowing his parents because he was given up for adoption as a baby.  Hoping to somehow connect to his parents and feeling that perhaps music can bring everyone together.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers (of The Tudors and other works) is the father he never knew.  Working with his more natural accent as an Irish rock and roll band member.  Keri Russell (Felicity and others) is the mother who was a featured member of the Philarmonic.  The two 'hook up' at a party, but are kept apart by her father.  Both are obviously gifted musicians in their own right, so they will of course produce a child prodigy.

Mixed in along the way are roles for Robin Williams, Terrence Howard and others that cross paths with the various characters here.  Can fate bring the proper parties together, or can there be no happy ending?  I've probably spoiled (unintentionally) that with my review title, but you've also probably already figured that by the time you read this review or any of the others here (or perhaps you saw the trailers for this film when it was in theatrical release).

The film didn't last that long in theatres, apparently not being able to find it's own voice amongst the rush and crush of other choices that potential movie-goers had to spend their entertainment money on.  That's a shame as parts of the film would be wonderful to view on a big screen.  Not that the high definition transfer for the Blu-ray is bad (nor will the same transfer that will be used for the HD DVD release be), or even the image (by what I've seen) for the DVD version.  No, they translate just fine to the smaller screen, but perhaps could be better enjoyed on a larger canvas.

The film is obviously about music and the music dominates throughout.  Not overwhelmingly so, but it's obvious that sound is a key element here, and dialogue is used more sparingly in conveying the message and interaction between the characters in the story.  The music is well choosen throughout, and helped to earn the film an Academy Award Nomination for one of it's musical selections.  Unfortunately for this film, there was strong competition from several films, so the prize went elsewhere and the film continued to be largely ignored without the 'bump' of being an Oscar winner.

I've rated the film at 3 stars.  Yet again, I think this is a film that deserves a little better, but not that much better.  Some will quite obviously find it quite enjoyable and think that it deserves more.  I understand that thinking and wouldn't argue with those that love the film.  I think most people would enjoy it once through, but not feel compelled to watch it repeatedly.  I could be wrong, but part of what might convince me to purchase a film like this on disc would be having more to explore on the disc.  Unfortunately the studio apparently didn't feel compelled to add much to the disc for this particular under-performer.  A selection of deleted scenes is all that is there.  No making of, no mini-documentary on selecting the music for the film, composing or performing the music, making the actors look believable in being gifted musicians, or anything else.

For most people, I'd recommend renting first.  You may throughly enjoy the film and wish to purchase, but you also may feel it was not something you wished to spend too much money on owning.  Try before you buy here if you can.

A quick nit to pick here on the film.  The use of time within the film, showing events of the past to set up how these characters got to be where they are in modern time is fine, but in showing the characters before the title character is conceived and born the parental characters are later surprisingly unchanged and apparently haven't aged a bit.  I realize that depicting a passage of a little more than a decade isn't easy, but at the same time people change.  You don't appear the same at 20 as you would at 30, or at 25 versus 35.  I wish film makers would put a little more effort into noticing such little things so they don't become distractions to films like this, and so that viewers are given more of a sense of a passage of time.",1205971200,,4420,4.584713375796178
3350152,5,B0013K7ZUE,"My family watched this movie and found it outstanding.  When it was over both my wife and I agreed that there was defiantly a family resemblance between this story line and the movie ""Oliver"" from the novel Oliver Twist.

3350154,4,B0013K7ZUE,"AUGUST RUSH will not go down in history as a profound film: many will even go so far as to dismiss it as kitsch, maudlin, and a simpleton take off on 'Oliver Twist', and other pejoratives. For this viewer the little film is tender and frequently requires suspension of belief, but in the end the idea of the story does indeed bring a tear to the eye.

Based on a story by Paul Castro and Nick Castle and transformed for the screen by Castle and James V. Hart, the premise is that of a fairytale, but an unusual fairytale built around the impact of music.  On one magic night in New York City classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and popular Irish guitarist/singer Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meet on a rooftop, languishing in their own disappointments with life and finding solace in each other's arms, and that night Lyla becomes pregnant, never to see Louis again, and struggling to keep her baby despite her father's demands to abort.  Lyla delivers her baby boy, but the child is immediately taken away (Lyla is told the child was stillborn).  'Evan Taylor' AKA August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is placed in an orphanage, longing for parents he believes he can 'hear' in the music of the spheres. Compelled to find his parents he escapes the orphanage after eleven years and is taken in by  Faginesque Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams) who teaches his street urchins the fine art of pick pocketing and playing music on the streets as buskers.  Renamed August Rush, Evan has uncommon musical talents and rapidly becomes a big money maker for Wizard while at the same time being discovered as a potential pupil for Juilliard by Reverend James (Mykelti Williamson) and his girl singer Hope (Jamia Simone Nash) with assistance from kindly social worker Richard Jefferies (Terrence Howard).  August Rush composes a rhapsody that is to be played in Central Park, a chance to place his music before the world and attract his parents, both of whom have returned to music careers after eleven years absence and learn of the existence of August Rush, their 'unknown son'. And yes, the ending is a happily ever after one...

Kirsten Sheridan directs with a sure hand and a keen eye toward make believe.  The cast is strong, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the musical score, a very mixed bag, provides a suitable background for the story.  This is one of those movies that asks us to go along with a lot of improbable events, but the pleasure of the experience is worth the journey.

Lyla (Keri Russell, of FELICITY), a concert cellist, and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish musician, meet on a New York City roof one evening. What with the moon being full, the two fall in love. And further shenanigans of the heart go down. But, the next morning, Lyla's controlling father speedily puts the kibosh on the romance before it really has a chance to flourish. When Lyla becomes pregnant with Louis' child and delivers, her father puts the baby up for adoption and tells Lyla that her baby had died. Louis's heartbreak and Lyla's tragedy cause them both to give up playing their music, even though Lyla would become a music teacher. So that was eleven years ago.

Cut now to the present, as a young orphan named Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) flees the Walden County Home for Boys. Evan is a weird kid, able to hear music from the most routine of noises in his environment. But he loves music more than food and believes that his parents aren't dead, that, in fact, if he follows the music, it'll lead him to his parents. He ends up following the music to New York City, and ends up in the clutches of Maxwell Wallace, more flashily known as the Wizard (Robin Williams).

The Wizard is an aging street hustler who takes in street kids with musical talent and makes them busk for a living (the Wizard gets a good cut of their earnings, you dig). Hanging out with the Wizard and his underaged worker bees, August Rush (as the Wizard would rename Evan) learns to play music for the first time, starting with the guitar. Further events unfold, and, soon enough, a pastor in church sees August wailing away on the pipe organ and is so impressed that he gets him into Juilliard. And from there it's a short step to this newly discovered musical prodigy conducting his own symphony to the New York Philharmonics in an outside concert in Central Park.

So many coincidences here that Bollywood is jealous. So, meanwhile, Lyla has discovered that her son is alive and begins a desperate search for him. She ends up in New York. Simultaneously, Louis has regained the itch to play his music and rejoins his old band. He also ends up in New York. And, by the movie's climax, everybody ends up in Central Park.

SPOILERS end.

Here's my two cents: Let's not get it twisted, AUGUST RUSH is meant to be a fable. And you have to buy into the film being a fable if you're gonna enjoy the viewing experience. Otherwise, it may get on your last nerve. Is this movie manipulative? Yes. Is AUGUST RUSH so ""sweet"" a film that diabetics aren't medically cleared to glimpse even its trailer? Hells, yeah. Do coincidences pile on more ridiculously than L.A. traffic on the 405 Freeway? Fo'shizzle! But I'm still giving it three stars. Mostly, I guess, it's 'cause I'm a sap, a sucker, a target audience. I just dig feel-good films and pictures which cling to the idea (or wish) that there's a higher purpose to things. That love and magic and music can carry the day. That wouldn't exactly suck, would it? Sue me, I got that optimist schtick going on.

But this is the part now where I kind of kick the movie in the groin. Thing is, man, are we ever asked to accept so many inconsistencies and leaps of logic. Yes, clearly AUGUST RUSH is intended to be a fantasy film, but even the most fantastical of fantasies must have some grounding, some rules to follow. AUGUST RUSH, in several scenes, just doesn't play fair. Since this is a fable, I get that Evan is able to suddenly, masterfully play the guitar (after messing about with it some during the night). I can swallow that. And the same with the piano. But I draw the line at Evan all of a sudden capable of composing maniacally after merely glancing at a music sheet (Is there, somewhere, a deleted sequence where he at least first studies notes and stuff for a bit?).

Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell punch in with some very good acting. And I truly wish they could've gotten more scenes together, as their characters are very engaging and rootable. The high points for me are actually the scene with Meyers and Russell having their cute meet and the scene with Meyers and Freddie Highmore dueting on guitars (easily the musical highlight of the film). Come to think of it, the musical sequences happen to provide some of the better parts of this film. And if Meyers is really doing his own singing, then color me truly appreciative. Freddie Highmore was pretty good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Neverland-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0007CNXUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000BB1MI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition)</a>. Here, he's the eponymous lead, but his acting, while sensitive, borders on being too precious. Next time, maybe ease up on the ethereal. The other two actors of note are Terrence Howard and Robin Williams. Howard is woefully underused as a concerned social worker and Williams is irritatingly overused (Seriously, Robin, what the hell happened? You were a decent actor for a while.). But Howard barely makes an impact, while Robin Williams checks in with one big fat hairy false note after another. He really doesn't do a good enough job of sinking into the skin of his role. So, when all's said and done, all I see is Robin Williams playing Robin Williams, and playing him awfully. I pretty much cringed everytime dude was on the screen.

A bit of fine tuning here, a bit of scene cutting there (like, all of the Robin Williams scenes), and, who knows, this could've been a much better film (Another thing that grated on me was the sappy and too abrupt ending). Still, if you can buy the outrageous premise and tolerate the incessant cloyingness and the rampant sentimentality...If you can not be annoyed at the film's blatant and clumsy attempts to orchestrate the audience's emotions (since every film does this)...And if you keep to heart the fact that AUGUST RUSH is a fable and so deserves a break from the Department of Keeping It Real, well, you might end up enjoying this. Me, even though I'm a bit horrified at the sheer over-the-topness of it all, I'm still leaning towards being generous. I see that this film wears its heart on its sleeve, and I salute that. And that it decided to go all balls out for what it wants, and that it fully commits to its music. Respect to that. I give props to the movie's hopeful message, which is that music unites. I'm just glad Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell were there to ground things. AUGUST RUSH, ultimately, ends up being flawed magic. But still magic.

And, by the way, that nine year old girl, Jamia Simone Nash, is a star waiting in the wings. She's got impressive pipes.",1205625600,,6915,4.882453151618399

This passion leads to a pregnancy, wanted by the girl, but unwanted by her father.  He's not a terrible villain.  He wants the best for her,and leads her to believe that her baby died during birth. The baby is a pleasantly odd little boy who hears the music around him. To the joy of the bullies in the children's home,he believes that some of what he hears is the music of his mother and father calling to him. The story unfolds as he leaves the home to search for the music. What unfolds has an echo of Oliver Twist, but not.  A wonderful movie!",1205625600,,931,4.395348837209302
3350166,5,B0013K7ZUE,First of all I have read a couple of other reviews and I don't think you need to write a synopsis of the whole plot line in a review.  This might take away from discovering the magic of a film to someone who hasn't seen it yet.  So that being said I will keep my review simple and to the point.  I found this movie to be amazing and awe-inspiring!!  I am a music teacher and I have always felt that music is my best friend.  Someplace to escape to when the world around me was not so great.  I do think that music connects us as human beings.  It is a God given gift and like August I can find music and all kinds of noise from the chirping of birds to the hustle and bustle of a busy city street.  If you believe in the power of music to bring people together than you must see this movie.  It will lift you up and help you to have faith in a world where life is often times difficult.,1205539200,,886,3.8777777777777778
3350167,5,B0013K7ZUE,"First of all I want to make it clear that I absolutely loved this movie.  The story is very beautiful and moving.  But the key to enjoying this movie is to realize that it is a fairy tale and not a typical drama or thriller.  Anyone familiar with musical theater or opera are used to suspending their normal skepticism to unlikely or even impossible plot situations and instead enjoying the heightened emotional reality that is portrayed.  This movie is not about clever plot twists or dialogue.  It is about the power of music and of love.  Those ideas are more important than even the characters in this movie.  For those of you who can not stomach the idea of that, then this movie is not for you.  But for those of you who enjoyed ""Across the Universe,"" ""Big Fish,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" hey, even ""Il Postino"" then you will probably have the artistic maturity to enjoy this film.

Being a professional musician and music teacher gave me in an interesting perspective on this film.  On the one hand, I can fully appreciate what the character Evan is implying with his line ""The music is all around you, all you have to do is listen.""  Music is simply sound, repeating vibrations in the air that are caused by all things that move.  Our music was at some point in the beginning derived from the sounds of nature, and I could tell that the composer tried to make the soundtrack sound initially more ""natural"" by using a lot of open octaves and fifths, the kind of harmony that is by far most prevalent in nature.  I was also deeply touched by the idea that the music ""of one's soul"" could attract another person.  The ancient Greeks believed in ""the music of the planets"" and the music of one's soul, in addition to our ""audible"" music.  The philosophers Plato, Boethius, Aristotle and others  came up with the ""doctrine of ethos"" which lies at the heart of this movie: that the harmonies of nature and the mind are inter-related with and affect the harmonies we create and enjoy in music.  The fact that music alone can elicit emotions in us proves that at least some of this ancient philosophy is true.

On the other hand, listening in closer to the soundtrack leaves me a little disappointed.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers is just barely good enough of a singer to get by as a professional musician--even for a rock singer--and his versions of ""Moondance"" and ""Something Inside"" start to sound like open mic at a karaoke night.  And I was sad to listen later to ""August's Rhapsody"" and find it is full of cinematic music cliche's and uninspired harmonic movement.  But I did not notice any of these things when I watched the movie (which is amazing for me) because of the effectiveness of the gestalt of the movie.  With a little effort to curb a desire to nit-pick, I enjoyed this movie so much that I would say it is one of the best I have ever seen.",1205539200,,2843,4.51171875
3350168,5,B0013K7ZUE,"So many reviews have focused on the ""Oliver Twist"" subplot to this film and failed to see the genius in the true structure.  August Rush is a clever inversion of classic Anastasia tales, where it is the parents, not the wayward child, who need to be reminded of whom they were meant to be.  On a spiritual level, this film has kinship to the legends of the reincarnation of the Buddha and the Christian emphasis on the importance of children in being able to perceive the heavenly realms.  Little Evan-August is music incarnate who seeks not only to restore his wayward parents, but to harmonize a discordant creation.  And the film as well as it's protagonist succeed!",1205539200,,669,4.6923076923076925
3350169,3,B0013K7ZUE,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

Schmaltzy and predictable, AUGUST RUSH will still manage to please most movie-goers. The basic ingredients make this so: a healthy helping of a cute young kid (Freddie Highmore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory/dp/B000BB96M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>), a dose of a busted-up, romantic, musical couple (Keri Russell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrubs/dp/B000AJJNI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrubs</a>, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Match-Point/dp/B000EQHXNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Match Point</a>), and the sprinkling of a slimy vagabond (Robin Williams,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Feet/dp/B00005JPCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Feet</a>).

Highmore has come a long way in his short life. Having immensely enjoyed his portrayal as Peter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Neverland/dp/B0007CNXUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Neverland</a>, I have followed the career path of this super-young-star with interest. Most recently he's starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00005JPNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spiderwick-Chronicles/dp/B00005JPXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a>, two blockbuster films. Whoever his agent is, they've done a fantastic job.

But Highmore has never taken on a role quite as focused as August Rush before. He tended to be overshadowed by the larger than life actors that played beside him (Johnny Depp, Anjelica Huston, etc.). But this time, the focus is all on his character, Evan/August Rush. His name change from Evan to August is affected by the wayward homeless musician ""The Wizard"" played by Robin Williams. The slime-factor is high for Williams here, higher than I've ever seen from him. This also made the story much more interesting and made you dislike Williams' Wizard character in the extreme.

The love story between Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is executed well if a bit distant and unrealistic. Their one night stand that results in a pregnancy becomes the culminating factor that binds all of the characters together. Well ...that ...and music, of course.

Evan (Highmore) is lost amidst the U.S. orphanage industry until he eventually makes good his escape. He carries with him only his belief that music will somehow connect him with his unknown parents. He's lived music his entire, short life, so whenever he comes into contact with an instrument (be it a guitar or a piano) he quickly grasps its workings and can play it within moments. A prodigy, he's soon called by those that know him. Pulling him away from his dreams, however, is The Wizard, a man who wants to personally capitalize on Evan's astounding abilities by prostituting him to the highest bidder ...the highest bidder willing to pay his manager (i.e., The Wizard).

Juilliard is offered up to Evan, and he quickly surpasses all those before him. But he still hasn't found his parents (who are also musicians), and a concert in New York's Central Park soon beckons them together. It's so sweet it'll make your eye-teeth ache.

Even with its overly-sweet beginning, middle, and end, August Rush is something of a must for those who enjoy unique musical playing and the process of melodious discovery.

Just don't eat any chocolate while watching it.",1205366400,,3769,6.936708860759493

Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are great. Russell's performance is truly excellent. She is cellist who becomes pregnant after one night with a bad singer. Throughout the movie, she searches for her son. Freddie Highmore is a fantastic actor. His face never lost that innocence and hopefulness that made the movie fantastic. The story was absolutely beautiful and hopeful. Yes, the movie is sentimental and full of events that are way too coincidental or do not make sense. But, so what? The movie is absolutely beautiful, and the plot and visual representations are enhanced through the music.

3350173,4,B0013K7ZUE,"Freddie Highmore as a guitar-playing Oliver, Robin Williams as Fagin, and even an Artful Dodger by the name of Arthur. The movie is indeed excellent, yet predictable (and completely satisfying).",1205193600,,194,5.5
3350174,5,B0013K7ZUE,"August Rush is a movie that will make you believe in love, miracles, and music. My favorite movie of all time.",1205193600,,110,4.285714285714286
3350175,5,B0013K7ZUE,"In the end, Faith is a yearning for Home that's stronger than Death itself. Many of the great spiritual sages have said this in some form, including Robert Frost, Frederick Buechner, Rob Bell and Jesus himself.

Of course, this all depends on how we conceive the idea of ""Home"" -- and ""August Rush"" takes the evolving ""music video"" genre into a transcendent, higher plane to explore one boy's profound yearning for a ""Home"" he never even knew, first hand. If you want something to be thankful for this year, buy this gloriously inventive movie that uses music as a metaphor for this abandoned boy's transcendent desire to reunite his shattered family.

Freddie Highmore plays August Rush, whose fantastical musical gifts turn the whole story into a fable about the deepest human desires for Home. The movie borrows liberally from ""Oliver Twist,"" with Robin Williams playing a desperate and, eventually, an absolutely despicable Fagin-like character. Williams is a street-savvy con man who teaches abandoned children to become street musicians in the hope of someday striking it rich by managing a true musical star.

At first, this Fagin discovers and befriends August -- but, when the boy's musical talents blossom, he winds up nearly destroying the boy.

While that may make the movie sound like a rewarming of leftover storylines, the homage to Charles Dickens only adds to the fairy-tale quality of the film. In fact, it's the magical fusion of musical styles throughout the movie -- from rock and folk to classical to jazzy new renditions of natural and urban soundscapes -- that make this a theatrical experience you won't want to miss.

Note to Rob Bell fans! If you love Rob's Nooma film, ""Rhythm"" -- well, ""August Rush"" is like a feature-length meditation on Rob's ""Rhythm"" theme. It's not as theological as Rob's reflection -- but it's the same message loud and clear with similar creative elements in the storytelling.

""August Rush"" opens with the abandoned boy who will become famous as a musical prodigy standing all alone in a lush green field of chest-high grasses, conducting the breezes that paint swirls in the moving sea of green and raise whooshing sounds into a symphony of natural noise.

He narrates the opening sequence, inviting us to: ""Listen! Can you hear it? The music? I can hear it everywhere,"" he says. ""In the wind. In the air. In the light.""

By the end of this film, you'll be hearing it, too, and soaring with little August as high as you'll let this glorious music carry you.",1205020800,,2512,4.894117647058824

3350179,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Went in knowing this movie was sentimental, plot-simple and without a close hold on reality.  Fair enough. Instead you suspend believe, get caught up in the story's mystical web and are transported to a land where dreams come true and the bonds of love and music draw you in completely.

The eclectic music was brilliant and mezmerizing.  The cinematography was thoughtful and well edited.  The actors were all well cast, (including  minor and supporting) all were compelling and believabvle in their parts, especially the brilliant young actor, Freddie Highmore who plays the boy music prodigy. The story builds at a nice pace, including the dramas of finding and losing throughout.  Sure the ending is predictable, but who cares when you have already been drawn in and you are rooting for that predictable end to happen?  It is magical and totally engaging, the kind of movie that makes you want to clap at the end (which my daughter and I did as did others in the theater.)  The trouble with critics (who see way too  many movies) is that they have lost their sense of wonder and delight, having already been there and done that from their perspective.

AUGUST RUSH was never meant to succeed on its plot.  It is the execution that makes all the difference.  As previously stated, when all the cinematic elements are right on:  acting, cinematography, editing, casting, music, direction, set and location, the result is a winner
The movie is refreshingly rated PG with nothing to offend anyone.

I found this movie to be incredible from the story line to the music to the development of the plot line.  The climax was a tear jerker even though you knew all along he was going to be reunited with his parents but the process by which this happens just keeps you filled with hope.

I expected a somewhat emotional string playing feel-good movie along the lines of a long line of those that have gone before it. The previews didn't do it justice.

If you love music, if you love creativity, if you love against-all-odds feel good stories, you are going to want to see this film.

The impossibility of the yeah-right plot actually works if you get pulled into the story. Imagine a scene from Hook with the Lost Boys, imagine Fievel gazing at the moon singing ""Somewhere Out There"" and Pinocchio's longing to be real, and his imprisonment, and you get a sense of Evan aka August Rush's journey to becoming found. Add Mr. Holland's Opus and you have an idea of the pulling together of events into a symphonic ""no way, but if it could happen that would be so cool"" finale. There is a some cheese and some serious emotional strumming going on, but because the film is full of longing, searching, and seeking, which is pretty much the human condition, I found August Rush to be soul-marking like all things beautiful and poignant. If you are moved by music and art, if stories of lost being found, and wrongs being righted, and the good guys getting a break, then August Rush is for you.

Very little bleeping language, and sex is completely behind the scenes. Who says a film has to have sex and f-bombs to work? There is a bit of violence, a fight between brothers with thrown fists and some blood. A few scenes are scary because one particular character is emotionally unstable and throws a mean temper tantrum, so really sensitive kids may have an issue or two.

The entire film is love honoring and respectful of humanity, beauty and the audience. God is treated with respect as is the church. I saw so many spiritual allegories that I quit counting so I could absorb the film. The only things that bugged my cynical self were too many blank faced closeups. And when the laws of reality make something not even close to possible, i.e. during a packed-out, standing-room-only concert, two characters walk parallel through a mass of people toward the front of a stage and can actually get through and unmolested at that.

Otherwise, it's a keeper.",1201910400,,2334,4.600961538461538

3350188,2,B0013K7ZUE,"There is a certain beat that goes on in the universe;a certain music that if one is atuned to it will bring everything just right. Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) knows this;he feels this with every fiber of his being,and this orphan knows that the voice of his parents,both musicians (Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) both call out to him at night. He has never known them,they have never known him (in fact Russell thinks he is dead and Meyers never was informed of a pregnancy as far as I could tell)but he feels them in the talking of the wind,the watching of the moon,the moving of the wheat in the fields...etc.

I couldn't buy this earnest film for one minute. I found the story,itself, to be so full of holes, that swiss cheese had better consistency than this film. I understand the premise of this film,and it is certainly not without merit,but I will only suspend belief only so far. AUGUST RUSH seemed to be a 2007 version of ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Annie"" with a neat and sharply edited soundtrack to make up for it's totally implausible premise. As a musician,myself,who went to conservatory,I could
not buy Keri Russell performing the Elgar Cello Concerto,much less getting an invite to the prestigious Central Park Concert after an eleven year hiatus from her cello. Only the ""being in sync with the universal rhythm"" could have pulled that one off. Jacqueline DuPre,as talented as she was,could not have done that in her lifetime! Evan,whose name is changed to ""August Rush"" by a Faginesque Robin Williams,learns instantly to play the guitar like a pro and his genius is discovered and exploited when he brings his tips back to Robin Williams, who houses UNDETECTED street urchin musicians in an abandoned Manhattan Theatre.
The final and biggest hole occurs at the end when Jonathan Rhys Meyers is musically drawn to the concert in the park where Evan ""August"" is conducting his inspired rhapsody that just came to him. Meyers serendipitously pushes his way to the front of the enormous crowd there to find Keri Russell after eleven years,he grabs her hand,nods to August....hello? did anyone ever tell him that HE was the father of this child?
For all of the smart editing and clever ideas that this film had, the story itself is pure ridiculous. The only thing that impressed me was that Jonathan Rhys -Meyers performed his own vocals. Highmore and Russell very obviously are not really performing and the quick edits hope to dazzle the viewer and keep them off balance from that fact. Some of the cuts of Russell playing both the Bach E Major Concerto and The Edward Elgar Concerto are deplorable with incorrect hand positions and simply on the wrong strings. Some people won't notice or even care about such things, but when you study music this film is like a history major seeing Ben-Hur with a wrist watch on! The editors were savvy to cut in and out in the music sequences in order to get that dizzying effect of the swirling of music, but all the guitar and cello coaching did not remotely pay off for me. Meyers was believable because he did his own work. This threw the believability factor of this film off for me. Meyers was spot-on, while Highmore and Russell were not. Why not find three REAL musicians?

Was this film destined to end on the right note? Yeah...there was never a doubt about it. It struck all the wrong chords with me. Cheesy and hokey are words that come to mind,but,hey,it's only a film .You won't get upset with my humble opinion as long as you are flowing with the rhythm of the universe.

""August Rush"" is a sweet, captivating story about an 11-year-old musical prodigy and it showcases the power of his simple but persistent and steadfast faith to make the impossible, POSSIBLE. It's a story that is very well done, very tenderly told and incredibly inspiring and uplifting.

The music is wonderful and the acting is all first-rate. As another reviewer said, I'm not one for movie soundtracks, but this is one I plan to order straight away. The 11-year-old musical prodigy (played by Freddie Highmore) is a delightful actor for the part and while I'm one of those people who doesn't really care for flicks with cutesy kids, this movie melted my heart into a puddle of tears.

It also provides a keyhole peak at how truly gifted musicians ""hear"" and experience the world. Speaking as someone who has struggled and struggled to write a few simple books, it was a pleasure to have an insight on how a true genius views the typically laborious process of creation.

The prevailing theme that I took from this movie is this: If we could strip away the many layers of fear, doubt, regret, guilt and all those other dark, burdensome emotions then it'd be easier for us all to find our own ""Insular tahiti.""

I highly recommend ""August Rush"" for anyone who has a heart and I recommend it even more for people who want to see a movie that leaves them with a reassuring hope that sometimes, things really are ""too good NOT to be true.""",1197849600,,1573,4.5638297872340425

Twelve years later, that boy, who will go by the name August Rush (Highmore), is in an orphanage.  He runs away to New York, where he discovers he has musical talent.  He believes that if he can make his parents hear his music, they will find him.

""August Rush"" is hokey, but harmless.  It is a nice movie that will be enjoyed by many, but there is not much substance to it.  If you can accept that music and fate bind these characters together, your enjoyment level will be higher.  In fact, musicians will be more likely to appreciate the film and its love of music.  Non-musicians may find it cheesy.",1197417600,,958,4.648809523809524

Aside from a few overly sappy moments - and a pitifully miscast Robin Williams - this was a treat for the eyes and ears that should not be missed. I personally think that Freddy Highmore should gain an Oscar nomination for his work here. The score also deserves a nomination, by the way. It is simply breathtaking.

3350198,5,B0013K7ZUE,"11-year-old Evan wants nothing more in life than to find his parents, or for them to find him. Labeled a freak by his fellow boys home residents it isn't long before he finds himself on the streets of New York in search of the mother and father he never knew. Like a fish out of water, the sights and sounds of the city that never sleeps are at once overwhelming and intoxicating. In every thumping foot, squealing tire, barking dog and rattling chain he hears a rhythm. Music. Harmonics no one hears but him. He knows if he just follows the music somehow his parents will find him. What he doesn't know is that his parents have no idea he exists.

Ten years ago his mother, Lyla (Keri Russell), a gifted celoist, was a young prodigy herself when she met Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the talented lead singer and guitarist for an Irish rock band. Immediately they share a bond, and their night together changes everything. Can the power of music bring this family of strangers back together again?

Don't let the somewhat un-inspiring title August Rush fool you. This movie is a heart-warming film with a rich narrative, visually diverse settings, and a lush original music score. Freddie Highmore's spot-on performance as Evan, who soon takes up the moniker August Rush, immediately invokes our sympathy. We truly care what happens to this bright-eyed, innocent boy who hasn't let himself become jaded by his harsh environment. (If he looks familiar it's probably because of his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Finding Neverland fame. He played the lead child roles in both.)

But it's not just Highmore who carries this movie. Every actor nails their role beautifully. Keri Russell (perhaps known best for the TV show Felicity) is a natural on the screen, skillfully bringing to life the character of Lyla both as a naive young woman and a passionate mother. Robin Williams' supporting role as a music pimp to a brood of unwanted yet musically gifted children cinches that he can play the deeper roles right alongside his lighter comedy ones. You'll also want to take notice of Terrence Howard's performance as social worker Richard Jeffries, a man in the system who genuinely cares for the kids under his care but often finds his hands frustratingly tied.

A few times suspension of disbelief is called for as August Rush is more about the fantastic than the realistic. It's a little hard to believe Evan is able to play both the guitar and organ like a master (not to mention conduct an orchestra) without ever having seen or touched the instruments before in his life. But you really don't mind. This movie has enough heart to carry it above and beyond those moments. Its portrayal of music's magic, that powerful tug on the human heart and soul, sets it apart from your average film tackling the same subjects.

Parents will appreciate the filmmaker's tact in portraying Lyla and Louis' one-night stand. No more than the beginnings of a passionate kiss are shown. A few swear words (h-- and d--) probably aren't appropriate for youngsters since several are uttered by children, but they really did have their place in showing you the hard existence of some of the street kids.

August Rush reminds us that amidst the hardships there truly is some good left in this world. You'll come away from this movie with a greater appreciation of music's power, not to mention the power of love and family. Definitely worth seeing more than once.

3350199,5,B0013K7ZUE,I thought that this movie was great. I loved the story line and the fact that I was able to watch a movie without swearing in it. It is an excellent family movie and gives hope to those who believe that if you try hard enough and have a little faith and imagination you can do great things.  I can not wait until I see it again and can purchase a copy when it comes out.,1196467200,,370,3.8684210526315788

I started crying the minute the movie started, and it was not just sadness, it was a strong emotion I just couldn't resist.  What an amazing movie, Freddie Highmore's performance wonderful, as always.  He really got to me!",1196035200,,352,4.223880597014926
3350201,5,B0013K7ZUE,"Some people hear the rhythm in a step, the strident beauty of a police siren, the whip of a powerline in the wind.  Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) doesn't get a decent night's sleep in the orphanage because of it.  His fellow inmates call him freak because he believes both his parents are living and they'll come for him--if only he call out with the music that connects them.

As he says, ""I believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales."" So, Evan decides after eleven years and some days to escape the orphanage and go find the music--and his parents.

Even ends up in New York City with zero street smarts.  He really doesn't even know how to cross the road. A fortunate encounter puts him near Arthur (Leon G. Thomas III), a street busker his age who's willing to help--for a price. Arthur introduces him to Wizard (Robin Williams) who gives musically talented street kids a place to stay in exchange for half their take. The Wizard quickly discovers that Evan, who he renames August Rush, is a prodigy and is making some plans for the lad.

Meanwhile, we learn that Even's mom Lyla Novacek (Kerri Russell) had only been with Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) one night. The Julliard educated cellist was in an accident while pregnant and her father decided to sign her name and give up her son--telling Lyla that he'd died.  Instead of the stage career her father envisioned, Lyla mostly gave up music and taught--til Julliard called her for a special concert in Central Park.

Louis has always longed for Lyla, the girl who got away.  He gave up his music and became a manager.  When he brings a girl to meet his family, they play a song he'd written for the band after Lyla's departure from his life.  He's determined to find Lyla.  When he believes she is married, he ends up in New York with no particular goals in mind except to find his music again.

""August Rush"" is just as much about the musical ties that bind us as the three people whose stories it tells.  In my opinion, the best performances were the kids: Evan-August, Arthur and Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). This trio kept you captivated and cheering.

Of course, the soundtrack is fabulous.  You have Kaki King on the guitar as well as vocals from John Legend and John Ondrasik (Five for Fighting fame). I'm ordering the soundtrack tonight and I really don't often like movie soundtracks well enough to order.

I wasn't the only person who'd give this film 5 stars.  This is one of the rare films I've attended where many of the audience stood and applauded at the end.  While this is a family film, I did notice that some of the younger children got restless and needed some explanation of what was going on.",1195948800,,2697,4.558091286307054
3350202,5,B0013K7ZUE,"I went to see this movie without having seen any reviews (a friend convinced me to go), and so I didn't know what to expect. It didn't take me very long to be engrossed in the film, but the highlight was definitely when the lead character, 11-year-old Evan Taylor, starts playing the music he hears. It's so inspirational, and the music is so different and amazing. I loved it. A beautifully made film with such a lovely message. I appreciate a previous review that explained that the movie is a fairy tale. And it is, full of the sweetness, vitality and greatness that we all hope for in real life.",1195948800,,599,4.454545454545454

3350204,5,B0013K7ZUE,"""August Rush"" is a fairy tale. It doesn't have princes, princesses, evil stepmothers, witches, or big bad wolves, but it's a fairy tale nonetheless. And as such, it tells a story that resonates so strongly with its audience that it casts a magic spell. This movie is told in the language of music, and it exemplifies the harmonic connections between people, the rhythmic bonds that can never be broken in spite of distance and time. It's also told in the language of faith, of the belief that love will indeed conquer all. No, this is not a realistic idea, but that's not the point. Isn't it nice that we have films like this to escape to when realism is bringing us down? Isn't it wonderful when we find that one film that can raise our spirits? ""August Rush"" was that film for me, and I recommend it to anyone in need of a rejuvenating emotional boost.

The film stars Freddie Highmore as an orphan named Evan Taylor, a quiet yet determined musical prodigy. He was born as the result of a chance encounter between two musicians: an Irish rock guitarist named Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and a classically trained American cellist named Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell). While living in New York City, they met and separated through twists of fate--Lyla's controlling father (William Sadler) doesn't take the news of her unplanned pregnancy very well, and when she's hit by a car and injured, he uses that opportunity to make her believe that her baby did not survive. In reality, the baby was delivered and put into the legal system as a parentless orphan. Lyla and Louis go their separate ways, believing that they would never see each other again.

In the present day, their eleven-year-old son Evan lives in an orphanage with a number of broken-spirited boys. They're so disillusioned that they bully him into believing as they do. They constantly tell him that no one is coming for him, that his ability to hear music in everything makes him nothing more than a freak. And they will not stand for his belief that he actually hears the music of his parents calling out to him. But Evan refuses to sink to their level of hopelessness; he runs away to New York City, where the music seems to be beckoning him towards his destiny. It's there he meets Wizard (Robin Williams), a shady musician who houses a number of musically inclined children in an abandoned theater. He, too, is beaten down by life, so much so that he uses these children for his own financial gain. When he discovers Evan's natural ability to play the guitar, he gives him the pseudonym August Rush and forces him to perform in parks and on street corners.

Lyla, meanwhile, is living in Chicago as a music teacher. Single and without any children, she seems complacent yet stable in her new life. But all that changes when (1) she's offered a change to once again play with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and (2) she learns that her baby did not die eleven years ago. With a powerful yet unexplainable determination, she travels back to New York on a quest to find her long lost son, a quest that will hopefully be added by her playing of the cello. Hoping to help find Evan is Richard Jeffries (Terrence Howard), a social worker who met the boy when he was still living at the orphanage.

And then, of course, there's Louis, who has since gone on to be a businessman in San Francisco. His band members haven't forgiven him for leaving, least of all his brother, Marshall (Alex O'Loughlin). But worst of all, Louis hasn't been able to forgive himself, and upon seeing footage of himself performing on stage, he remembers the love he felt for Lyla. The memory is so strong that's he vows to reunite with her. This journey of finding lost love leads him from Chicago back to New York City, where he's inspired to rejoin with his band and restart his singing career. Much like his son--whom he doesn't know exists--Louis is a gifted guitar player; one can hear his passion and energy with every chord, and his music operates at the same frequency as Lyla's cello playing.

As you can probably tell, most of the film thrives on serendipity, and it gets more and more prominent with every passing scene. A kind-hearted pastor eventually takes Evan in, and when made aware of his musical genius, they send him to the Julliard School of Music. He composes a piece within the first six months of his stay, one that the faculty believes is good enough to be performed. Thus sets into motion the events leading to one of the most satisfying endings of any movie I've seen this year, a scene so touching that I was in awe. As I listened to Evan's ""August's Rhapsody,"" I felt as if I had been enveloped in the folds of hope, love, and happiness; the earthiness of the chimes blended perfectly with the smoothness of the violins and the energy of the guitars, all of which made his unwavering faith in the power of connection perfectly clear.

This is the magic of ""August Rush,"" a film so wonderful that I cannot recommend it enough. It's a modern day fable with a timeless message, and it comes across so well that I never once stopped to consider how implausible it is. Plausibility doesn't even come into play, here. What does come into play is the emotional impact, the sense that we can get something out of it if we surrender to pure fantasy. Evan opens the film by saying, ""Music is all around us--all we have to do is listen."" This is one of the year's best films, and if you keep that quote in mind when seeing it, you'll be more inclined to agree.",1195516800,,5529,4.574167507568113
