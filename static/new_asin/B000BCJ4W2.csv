8085117,5,B000BCJ4W2,"Same as my review for Beginning Myofascial Release- this is a great DVD that really shows how to help change someone posture and alot more. It is clearly filmed, has great graphics that help to clarify the information. This DVD is a great value for the money. All the technques I could apply immediately into my practice.

8085119,2,B000BCJ4W2,"See my review on ""Beginning Myofascial Release"". This is supposed to be ""Advance"". There's nothing advanced about it. Some of the techniques aren't even myofascial release they are muscle energy instead!",1073088000,,203,5.580645161290323
