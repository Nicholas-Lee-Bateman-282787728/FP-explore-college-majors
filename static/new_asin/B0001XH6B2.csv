2042716,4,B0001XH6B2,"I wonder whatever happened to Dalton McCrary.... This collection is the best golf instruction I've ever had.

I've been taking golf lessons ever since I was six years old. Too frequently my instructors cluttered my thoughts with all the things I had to do.

Dalton simplifies everything. He also explains why it will work.

For the first time in my life, I was consistently getting into the correct positions, without thinking and I could not help but swing squarely through the ball.

The film quality is fairly amateur but the instruction is easy to follow and easy to replicate.

Within just a couple of tapes, after doing a couple of drills, I really was hitting the golf ball as straight as I could point.

I lost about 5-6 yards in distance on my irons, but this is more than compensated for by playing mostly in the short grass.

I wish this was available on DVD. I had to quit playing for several years due to back injuries. Now that I'm healed, I'd love to get my hands on another copy as a refresher.",1357257600,,1010,4.4863387978142075
2042717,5,B0001XH6B2,"I have been using Dalton's system for 16 years now.  I am a scratch golfer.  I will tell you that this swing is easier to understand than any other but it like all the other still requires practice.  One benefit to this swing is that after a few years and the muscle memory takes hold then it is pretty easy to take off sometime and still be able to stripe it.  You need to follow all of Dalton's steps exact though.  Also, you need to move the ball back in your stance just a little.  Maybe an inch or less.  The rollling of the LEFT HAND ONLY is the key.  You must learn to keep the right hand out of the swing if you are going to do this swing.  It will work but you have to put in the time.  I think this swing is easier to practice than any other.",1355961600,3,752,3.888157894736842
2042718,5,B0001XH6B2,"I can't even begin to count how many golf books I've read and golf videos I've watched in the last two years since getting serious about the game. I found Dalton's tape series at a thrift store, purchased it because it was cheap, and didn't get around to pulling out the old VCR and watching it for months.

I watched these for the first time about four days ago, have been to the range twice since, and WOW!! Much straighter and much longer with my irons! This is an entirely different way to swing the club, but it's simple! As Dalton says multiple times in his strong West Texas drawl, ""Golf is NOT rocket science, folks!""

This series works off of the premise that typical golf swings have a point at the bottom of the golf swing where the clubface is square to the target line for only a few inches - if ever. Swinging the club with Dalton's method will give you a square-to-target line travel distance of up to 40 inches!! Essentially, your swing will become very upright with this method. Dalton points out that most golfers' lie angles on their irons are WAY too flat, even with the swings that they currently use. A simple demonstration shown in this series is more of an observance that most golfers have probably never made - hit an iron until you have dirtied up the face with several of your swings, and then look at the dirt line. If dirt in your grooves starts low at the hosel and is in higher grooves out near the toe, that's how far you're digging into the turf with the toe of your club during your swing. That dirt line on the face is flat with the ground at impact. The toe digs in, your clubface opens at impact, AND you'll hit it on the toe of the club. So... Step 1 with this method (you probably need to anyway), is get the lie angle of your clubs fixed! They may need to be bent four degrees upright, or maybe even more. You can get improvement in your swing without altering your clubs, but don't fail to get your clubs altered if you're REALLY serious about throwing darts at the flag - every time.

Bottom Line: This tape series from 1998 is truly amazing! After you see how simple it is and do it yourself on the range several times, you're going to wonder how much time (and money) you have wasted watching DVD after DVD from the famous instructors, taking notes, taking lessons, etc. Get it, get your lie angles adjusted, and start peppering that flag!",1343865600,2,2384,4.364864864864865
2042719,5,B0001XH6B2,This lesson series is a must-see for any golfer who can't seem to break 100.  If you use the advice contained in the lessons you will lower your handicap by at least ten strokes.,1328054400,,178,4.235294117647059
2042720,5,B0001XH6B2,"A very entertaining look at some new thoughts on the golf swing. Fairly easy to pick up on Dalton's fundamentals. Comes  with about 4 tapes including secrets of the flat stick, and a written manual, and a small guide to drills, etc that you can take with you to the range. I would recommend this to anyone and I've probably seen just about every decent intructional package.",1238457600,3,374,4.582089552238806

8017938,5,B0001XH6B2,I thought the series of tape made a lot of sense for me. It really has helped me get to the left side. I have basically eliminated my slice. I am hitting 15 to 18 fairways every time I play.,1489190400,2,190,3.775

8017942,4,B0001XH6B2,Mr. McCrarys has a unique perspective on the golf swing which I found both enjoyable and informative.,1448582400,,101,5.0
8017943,5,B0001XH6B2,"This Video Series was excellent.  On October 18th 2014, the day after I went through all 4 videos, I shot my best round all year.  I shot an 88 on a tough course....It was extremely helpful in showing me where my hands and arms need to be in relation to my shoulders on my back swing.",1413676800,,284,4.053571428571429
8017944,4,B0001XH6B2,"Wished it was available in dvd, but it is a wonderful aid to hitting a straight ball cured my slice",1395878400,,99,4.0
8017945,5,B0001XH6B2,"The package was in great condition, obviously well taken care of.  The tapes were great.  He has a very unique style but his technique of pushing the club back vs pulling it back to the 1 position was very helpful.  He advocates a very upright swing and if you have ever seen any videos from Don ""the serge"" trehan, is very similar.  Jack Nicklaus had a very upright swing and it worked for him.  Bottom line is with the rotational swing, you rely on your core turning and the club is only square a couple of inches before the strike and what Dalton McCrarry is teaching is to have the club square a foot or more before impact and also through the hit and the ball will not curve but go straight.  The good thing is he really reinforces his technique through extensive drills and it really starts to sink in.  You will hear 1 and roll in your sleep.",1387497600,,849,4.26875
8017946,5,B0001XH6B2,"I worked on this for 1 month, and it works.  You will lower your score and after a lifetime of slicing I am now hitting it straight.",1375660800,,132,3.888888888888889
