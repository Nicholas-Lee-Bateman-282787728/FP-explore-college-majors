It provides an in depth review of gold, how it's recovered and demonstrates a variety of wet and dry methods of recovery.  When I first stared this I watched this over and over.

A couple of good tips on where to find gold in rivers, but that's all. Like I said, internet research is preferable to this DVD!",1273276800,7,304,4.169491525423729
