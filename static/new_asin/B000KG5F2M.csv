8156352,5,B000KG5F2M,Les is an entertaining speaker with great wisdom. It's worth every penny if you wish to continue moving up the ladder of success.,1390089600,2,129,4.6521739130434785
8156353,2,B000KG5F2M,Sounds like a southern baptist preacher. I almost thought that he was going to burst into song. Too smarmy for me.,1374969600,,114,4.476190476190476
8156354,4,B000KG5F2M,"I love Les Brown. Perhaps I have seen too many Les Brown videos, so this video had a lot of the same material he has used in his other speeches.  Les Brown has such great stories and examples to help me get motivated.  He keeps you thinking about which direction your life is headed, and how to set goals and make a change.",1337644800,4,323,4.111111111111111
8156355,5,B000KG5F2M,"On yesterday, I had the privileged to watch this dvd on a big screen at a Conference Les Brown had at Jesus House DC. It was an awesome experience to watch him stir up the crowd and everything within me. I was pumped to the max after watching this event, ready to accomplish the things I have always wanted to. In this dvd, he shared so many advises, so many types of success it is simply an awesome material to have in my library. We left the building with our mind completely changed for the better after he spoke following the dvd presentation. My heartfelt Gratitude to both Les Brown and Pastor Ghandi of Jesus House DC for exposing us to such priceless and tremendous knowledge.

8156356,5,B000KG5F2M,"This was such a great DVD! I really got a lot out of it.  I saved a lot of money buying the DVD, as opposed to going to the live seminar. It was cool to see the audience interacting with Les Brown, I felt like I was right there.  I stopped it a few times to take notes and consider what he was talking about, too.  I recommend it.

But hearing his story was incredible, Live Full & Die Empty is such a powerful philosophy... and it's so easy to relate to.  He has some awesome stories about his past and what he's done to get to this stage in his life...  you never feel like he's preaching or exaggerating at all.  He genuinely wants to see everyone enjoy life and be as successful as he is - so great!",1194480000,10,703,3.9785714285714286
