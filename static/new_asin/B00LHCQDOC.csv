8665918,5,B00LHCQDOC,I love this priduct sooo much. I comes with all the luxuries in very flatteringly packsging. It works splendidly with such convenience. And not to mention extremely affordable.

8665919,4,B00LHCQDOC,"I always like getting more than one movie in a package. Cloverfield is good, if you understand that this isn't just a monster movie, but also about what young people might think and do if in this situation. Well made. Dark City is in a bracket all it's own. I had not seen this one before, but was pleasantly surprise because it is on the fringe. I would have loved to have been in the mind of the writer that came up with this story line! Script is okay as was the casting, but worth the money.",1464566400,2,495,4.11340206185567
