8318819,2,B001LNG6S0,this blue ray never showed a full subscription of the wildlife. I bought it because of the Blu-ray cd player purchased and wanted to see how the 1080p looked.,1398988800,,158,4.482758620689655
8318820,5,B001LNG6S0,"Awesome documentary. It focuses on how animals born with unusual colors (i.e. mutations) have a much harder struggle than normal. It mostly follows 3: a white lion, a white baboon, and a yellow crocodile. It also explores other animals and what life without pigmentation, camouflage, etc. is like for them.

Its African narrator adds a fresh dimension to the film by blending the science with local lore. For example why the leopard and the monkey are now enemies but once were friends and why, in African lore, there are animals with unusual colors: the messengers.

Well worth your money.",1273536000,2,590,4.94949494949495
