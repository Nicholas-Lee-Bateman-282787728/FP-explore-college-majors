8273804,3,B0019F02VC,"It tells the story BUT the animation is completely outdated.  It may be inappropriate for children under the 5 grade, there are parts that may even be scary for younger children.  (For example: When the Prodigal Son visits a fortune teller?)  I am sure there are better versions of this story.  My advice would be to keep searching.",1405296000,2,332,4.672413793103448
8273805,2,B0019F02VC,"We own several of the nest family videos and even though I know they use their imagination to create a 30 minute DVD, I wish they stayed close to the biblical account as much as possible. The most beautiful part about the story of the prodigal son is that the Father had been waiting for his son every day. In this version of the story, the dog is the first one to see the son coming in the distance and not the father. It completely ruined a wonderful story! I was very disappointed. We don't watch this video at our home anymore.",1334620800,7,531,4.215686274509804
8273806,4,B0019F02VC,"I'm not sure why the other reviews on this DVD are so bad.  This is NOT the series with Charleton Heston and the boy on the camel.  This series was produced by a Mormon company with input from Christian denominations so that they could also be a useful tool for all family who want to teach their children the Bible.  This movie is true to Scripture (obviously with some artistic license to make it a half hour, but it brings the story to life and doesn't change the story at all).  It's not up to today's animation standards, but my young children aren't such connoisseurs that they didn't enjoy watching it.  Maybe they just don't watch enough television or movies.  I appreciate this whole series, and I think this DVD is a valuable resource for teaching my children about God's love.",1328400000,6,787,4.546099290780142
