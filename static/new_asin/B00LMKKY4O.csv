8666715,2,B00LMKKY4O,"To start off, I loved Soap. I was sad when Robert Gillaume left the show halfway through, so I bought this to see a continuation of the Benson character. Oh boy, was that a bad idea.

Benson is almost nothing like Soap. It does share a couple actors in non-related roles, but the flow, writing style, and presentation is nothing like the frenetic, intertwining, multi-episode arcs that make Soap so wonderfully unique.

Instead, it's a formulaic sitcom, where Benson (Robert Guillaume) is hired as the new butler for an inept governor. Guillaume does well in this show, and his character wasn't changed overly much from Soap. It's amusing to see him in a battle of wills with the housekeeper, and the archetype of the bumbling politician is humorous, but the show doesn't have much substance, which is a huge letdown when comparing with its parent show.

I watched the first disc or so, and couldn't watch any more. It's a cute show, but I don't recommend it if you are looking for an expansion into the Soap universe and its wonderful insanity.",1520553600,,1045,4.730769230769231
