8425720,5,B004DN2Y5Y,this was a gift for a big WWE fan and he really loved it. He is a knucklehead  too so it was the perfect gift. WWE really utilizes the dvd  as a great tool in there arsenal.,1446422400,,173,3.6486486486486487

8425723,1,B004DN2Y5Y,im a fan of the attitude era but since wwf no longer wwf now wwe vince has gone too pg and he owns hours upon hours of amazing storylines and matches and he releases dvds like this vince destroyed his own company from the inside i can see why now i hate him and the wwe iv seen alot of bloodshed and over the top storylines but this dvd is just a lame and boring release thanks vince for destroying my childhood,1331337600,,411,4.024390243902439
8425724,3,B004DN2Y5Y,"Several of the clips in this dvd are funny, but some aren't at all. What really bugged me about this dvd is that they wasted about 10 minutes on the McMahon-Donald Trump feud, which ended in Vince getting his head shaved. I didn't really find that segment funny at all. Same goes for the lame Hornswoggle clips. The Bushwhackers, Rock, and DX clips were good. All in all, it's okay, but unless you're a BIG wrestling fan, I'd suggest renting it over buying it.",1303171200,3,460,4.488095238095238
8425725,3,B004DN2Y5Y,"Just like how WWE did with John Cena's recent movie in ""Legendary"", WWE quietly released a DVD called ""Knucklehead Moments"" in support of Big Show's movie ""Knucklehead.""  Big Show host this set along with Josh Matthews & is a ""no frills"" set in that it goes for around an hour with no bonus extras & is just strictly highlights & video packages of past funny moments in WWE history.  With the exception of a moment with the Bushwackers, there were no moments on here that happened BEFORE the ""Attitude Era"" which means if your expecting funny moments from the likes of Bobby Heenan then you won't find it here while some of these clips are just repeats from other sets like the SmackDown 10th Anniversary DVD.

Here's a listing of all the ""Knucklehead"" moments on this set:
-Santino gives a swimsuit exhibition to the divas
-Hornswoggle vs. Chavo Guerrero who has one hand tied behind his back
-Chris Jericho reads his list of 1,004 holds
-Big Show's impressions of Fat Bastard & Hulk Hogan
-Al Snow & Steve Blackman together as ""Head Cheese""
-Pat Patterson & Gerald Brisco vs. Mean Steve Posse
-The Rock's famous insults
-Mean Gene Okerland having a cookout with the Bushwackers
-DX vs. Spirit Squad in a handicap elimination match from Saturday Night's Main Event
-Vince McMahon gets his haircut at WrestleMania 23

As I said earlier, this is one of those ""under the radar"" releases that was originally put out as an extra to get people to buy the ""Knucklehead"" movie (same way they did with the ""Legendary Moments"") so I didn't expect much effort put into here but  I still have to say though that some of these moments weren't funny to me while others made me think ""that's the best they could pick out with him?""  In the end, if you don't already have these moments on DVD, actually remember & was entertained by most of these moments & have some spare cash you won't miss then I would give this a watch but otherwise, pass on this.",1302480000,7,1937,4.6
8425726,1,B004DN2Y5Y,"Why WWE releases trash like this is beyond me... couldn't they have put out a ""Best of Georgia"" or ""Best of Mid Atlantic"" instead? McMahon owns thousands and thousands of hours of classic wrestling and this is the best he (or his paid flak) could come up with? Groan... How 'bout a look at Harley Race? Or Jack Brisco? Or the Funks? ANYTHING but silly garbage like this!!!",1301011200,8,372,4.485294117647059
8425727,5,B004DN2Y5Y,"i just finished watching this dvd and i must say the wwe did a great job. i hope they release more dvds like this in the future. not only do they have goofy moments but you also get three matches. 1)chavo guerrero vs hornswoggle funny match 2)the goons vs the mean street posse one of my all time favorite matches. and 3)dx vs the spirit squad elimination match, i will say this match is way overplayed. all in all very entertaining and enjoyable dvd.",1297382400,6,451,4.380952380952381
8425728,1,B004DN2Y5Y,"I typed it before and I'll type it again,They sure got the name right. It makes fools out of wrestlers we like and look up to. It's dvds like this that give wrestlers and wrestling promotions a bad name. If you want to see wrestlers and/or wrestling promotions at thier worse? Go watch either a WCW tape from 1999 and/or 2000 or The Pro wrestling Gone Wrong dvd. Same diffrence. I give this dvd a 0 out of 10.",1295654400,11,409,4.189873417721519
