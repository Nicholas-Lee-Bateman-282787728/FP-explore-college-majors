5737844,5,B00CSW08NC,"I adore movies of this type.  Disasters on a screen are fun, if not in real life.  Well acted, even the creepy guy who was convinced he knew what was going on and knew better than anyone.  So sad when he died. yawn. On to the good stuff; a new family working together to solve the crisis.",1381104000,,288,4.017543859649122
5737845,3,B00CSW08NC,"Well, not for sure if this was fun because I live in Seattle and it was fun to connect with known scenery.  Or - if it was another disaster film, this time placed in Seattle.  There was a different spin but it didn't seem plausible as far as such quick outcomes.  It would be fun for the teens and preteens though, because young people make major contributions in survival.  It doesn't push the brain or stress much... so why not?  Enjoy while conversing and having fun with friends over popcorn.",1380758400,2,496,4.466666666666667
5737846,2,B00CSW08NC,"Not a very well done movie. I just did not entertain me. Special effects were ok, that's about all. Sorry to say.",1380412800,,113,4.181818181818182
5737847,1,B00CSW08NC,My wife loves disaster movies so we bought this movie at Wal*Mart. The special effect was awful the story line made no sense. The problem wasn't with the actors so much as the writing and the special effects. Don't bother to buy this movie. We should expect more from movie makers this day and age its not 1980 anymore. Now if it could be put on an episode of 'Mystery Science Theater' it would be great love that show ;-),1379289600,2,422,4.2875
5737848,3,B00CSW08NC,Story line was good but the acting was less than OK. The no-name actors did better than the known names.,1378944000,2,104,4.25
5737849,4,B00CSW08NC,"The special effects where alright same with the cast,but they could of kept the family stuff out of this,and the hole things starts out as A UFO which is thought to be A metorite which starts some thing odd with the weather. The rock from space turns out be A space craft of unknown origin. Which turns out from earth from A very long time ago,which had some strange cargo which causing the odd weather,and as usually A team of scientist come and save everyone as always.",1378080000,4,471,4.425287356321839
5737850,1,B00CSW08NC,"Maybe I shouldn't have watched Star Trek Into Darkness right before watching this movie and expected too much.

The usual lame script, direction, special effects, and acting from the Syfy Channel. At least with their other movies they seem to be able to get some B List actors who make an attempt to salvage the movie. They probably read this script and passed. This movie had the formula family issue and then they come together in the end and save the world (or in this case Seattle) but was more clumsy and predictable by the lightweight actors. Instead of spending your money on watching Seattle get saved, I would spend the money on a double latte from a Seattle coffee company instead. Not a deep review but this is all the time and thought I wanted to spend on it.",1377561600,13,771,4.507142857142857

5737861,3,B00CSW08NC,"Clearly in a genre movie like this, none of us are seeking high drama, and this one delivers the thrill of the chase with a side dish of sarcastic humor as the disaster progresses.  It was obviously filmed at least in part in Seattle, so it was fun to see the actual places in the movie too.",1464566400,,291,4.105263157894737

5737871,1,B00CSW08NC,"Wow, I saw that it was rated up there, and I realized it was going to be a B, but was not prepared for how bad B it was.  The acting, along with the unbelievable scenarios, and a teenage girl providing solutions to people majorly experienced in their fields, all because she learned some chemistry in high school...  ROFLMAO  I remember chemistry in high school...  definitely nothing in that class alone to even come close to the kind of knowledge that this chick had ... again above and beyond those in their experienced fields.

This storm was some countries mad science project that some how in a sane moment saw the light and sent this horrible nightmare of man's doing into very deep space. Now we are safe...oh how they thought until the space craft drifted to earth and was pulled in by Earths gravity. You need to watch how the story is laid out",1439769600,2,473,4.325842696629214

5737900,4,B00CSW08NC,"It's an amazing movie with great dramatics. They should have stopped the superstorm from forming with water before the storm got worse. If that were the case, then the movie wouldn't have lasted as long.",1416787200,,203,4.828571428571428
5737901,2,B00CSW08NC,"This is one of those low budget Sci-fi movies, where a mystery object crashes in Seattle and the only people who have a clue of what is going on is the couple with the most bratty teenagers ever.  You got the government type who is against our would be saviors.  The couple  of characters that we just know are not going to live to see the end credits but who come on the hero's side.
""Seattle Superstorm"" is one of those Sy-Fy movie you watch once and then forget about and not really worth owning.",1415491200,2,499,4.231578947368421

5737903,3,B00CSW08NC,"I'm almost certain this could never happen.  Those pesky Russians lobbed something into space eons ago and wouldn't you know it, it belatedly/suddenly heads for Seattle one rainy day and has to be shot down, which creates an even bigger mess, because there was a really bad experiment on-board.  Thank goodness it happened on a day when scientist Tom (Esai Morales) and his intended (Ona Grauer as Lt. Cmdr. Emma) were in town with their bickering teens so they could handily save the world (and what was left of Seattle).  And what a break, a Russian geezer (Jay Brazeau) happens to be passing by and it turns out that he's just the guy needed to explain the biological weapon they shot down.  Too bad they first have to deal with a megalomaniac dope with a gun he's not afraid to use.  He's miffed because they won't let him blow something up.  How rude.

I had oodles of fun watching this mess of epic proportions.  The characters were all stock.  Just about everyone is plucky.  The dialog is very gung ho.  Ona Grauer does macho like no one can or should.  The story is fanciful.  People run and scream.  I saw more close-ups of shoes than I ever wanted to.  At least it had a dandy moral: the family that saves together stays together!

It's crap but it's funny crap.",1415145600,15,1273,4.493449781659389
5737904,3,B00CSW08NC,A soon to be new family - mother (a Major in the service) with one daughter and father (a scientist) with one son will marry soon.  The soon to be new family kids hate each other and don't want this marriage to take place.  They are all in Seattle close to the Space Needle.  The parents are teamed up to find out what this is and how to stop the heavy rains and hurricane-force winds before it annihilates the whole planet.  It's a pretty good story.,1413158400,3,451,4.209302325581396
5737905,5,B00CSW08NC,"I ordered this today. I am a collector of schlocky disaster/monster/horror ""B"" movies from The Asylum and other
crank-'em-out-this-week movies. I prefer the titles that cost less than $13 [for superstitious reasons]. I cannot be-
lieve that I missed THIS one (I just ordered it after searching previous orders).

I'm popping some corn right now in anticipation of how CHEESY this will be. If it sucks, I'll edit this and tell you ALL

The solution to the storm was so obvious to them, yet they couldn't figure it out till the end??  Not many storm shots in the movie, and bad script lines throughout.

5737919,1,B00CSW08NC,"1. Really bad science - not even up to middle school level. All of it and there was a lot just thrown in for no reason other than sound bites.
2. Stilted, robotic acting. A lot of unemotional read a line; cut and edit; read another line, etc. No more than a line at a time; sounded like memorized moments before. Stupid dialogue only possible from script writers who have no clue about real life conversations at any level.
3. Really bad visual effects/graphics; seemed more cartoonish than real. Especially the missile launched; falling debris; smoke columns; fake electrical storm; fake tornado.
4. Produced out of B.C. and probably filmed there with a few, repeated over and over, boring cut scenes taken from a Seattle tourist promo.
5. The usual fake few people running in a panic dropping groceries (cheap to drop) and locking as if they're really posing for the cameras. Usual fake debris flying about.
6. Predictable ending with the stereotypical teen coming up with an idea to save the world and it works.
7. In the credits it seemed as if every other person was an assistant to someone (brave of them to agree to have their names listed), even one called ""Best boy"". They'e assistants because the budget called for lots of free on the job training help.",1385424000,10,1263,4.693693693693693
