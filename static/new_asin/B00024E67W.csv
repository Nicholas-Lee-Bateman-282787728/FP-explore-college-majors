2062103,2,B00024E67W,"WARNING:  I think this dvd is most likely a bootleg!  I had an idea of this when I first looked at the case and then opened it.  The dvd comes in a very generic case, just the photo you see in the listing (w/ a back-cover photo also), no additional info. or inserts.  Also the photos look like collage shots from the movie, which could be made by almost any laser printer.  When I looked at the actual dvd playing surface it is a purplish-blue color, which indicates it probably is a burned copy.
When I actually tried to watch the dvd, that's when I was certain it was/is an unofficial dvd copy.  It first starts out in English, then switches over to subtitles, and switches back and forth in some spots. These subtitles are hardly readable because they are white and can't be seen when the film's background is white-ish or light.  Picture quality is not very good either (got me how they can say it's remastered in the ad).  It's really too bad this isn't an official release because I was dying to see this movie.  However, because of the quality of this dvd, I could hardly finish watching it.  Fyi to all you people out there; the official U.S. releases for Jackie Chan are on Dimension, New Line, Touchstone, Columbia Tri-star or 20th Century Fox/Fortune Star Home Video.  Also Tai Seng Video if they're Asian releases made available for the U.S. market (many are dubbed but majority are subtitled).  I learned my lesson on this one and I'm only going to get the official, authorized releases.",1107388800,4,1500,4.5353159851301115

2062106,5,B00024E67W,"Dark Jackie. Yes, pretty much that sums it all up in Thunderbolt, a not-so-easy-to-find film of Jackie Chan's. It was made right after his hit ""Rumble in the Bronx"" when his ankle was still broken and as I understand it (which could be wrong) Aaron Kwok, trained by Sammo Hung, did some of the stunt doubling. I like Aaron, so this is okay by me. Now, as the title states, this is not your average happy-go-lucky Jackie film. He smiles all of twice in this film, is angry and driven, and I love it! Jackie works as a master mechanic in an autoshop his father runs. In his free time, Jackie helps the police with illegally upgraded cars. At one point, a bad guy named Cougar (What's with the animal bad guy names??) goes racing around,  kills a cop at a blockade, Jackie jumps in a car to chase him down and, while not a racecar driver like Cougar, manages to best the baddie. The baddie is carted off to prison where his evil minions break him out not too long after. In the interim, a lovely female reporter stalks Jackie to get an interview about his brave act. Well, once Cougar is free, he wants revenge of course, and a rematch, so in one of the most brutal 6 minutes I've ever seen, Cougar tears Jackie a new one using a crane and Jackie's own house. Jackie's whole family is there as well, and all get the snot kicked out of them. One of his two sisters is kidnapped and one goes vegetable from shock and damage. His father, too, suffers a heart attack and Jackie rushes him to the hospital where only an injection, sneakily executed by a doctor, calms Jackie down. Cougar kidnaps both sisters, using them as insurance that Jackie will take his challenge to race him in a high-profile professional race. (I am not a racing fan, so I'm not sure if it was grand-prix, or what.) Of course, obstacles get in the way: the reporter gets a crush on Jackie and messes a few things up even as she tries for a good story that would threaten Jackie's sisters' safety, Jackie doesn't have a car that will work for what he needs, he's in emotional turmoil over his father and sisters, etc... How does it end? Watch and find out! As an avid Jackie fan, I own most of his movies and this one is in my top fave 8. It's awesome and I love Jackie's darker, angstier side. (He's scary when he's mad.) Plenty of action, too, and one of the coolest fights scenes ever in a casino full of Pachinko games. Don't get this movie hoping for light and laughs, it's not like that. This is grittier, edgier and awesome. I don't even mind the small romance subplot. Get it!",1084406400,3,2550,4.334728033472803
2062107,2,B00024E67W,"This movie is not very good. The villains are completely ineffective. The action is mostly bad with a few highlights. Jackie was recovering from his foot injury due to jumping onto the moving hovercraft from Rumble in the Bronx when he made this film so a stunt double was employed multiple times during Jackie's fight scenes. I typically don't mind the use of stunt doubles but in this film, it is so jarringly obvious. Jackie looks nothing like that guy and has a completely different style. Also, one fight scene has an extended use of blurry slo mo that hurts the eyes, not to mention the frequent wirework. There are some interesting character bits and a great race early on in the film but the plot and screenplay are underwhelming. The smiling scene is potent but the film has too many flaws. There are great snippets of action and the story never becomes too boring. I would only recommend this film if you are a huge racing fan.",1470441600,,937,4.583333333333333
2062108,3,B00024E67W,"Jackie Chan was not particularly happy with the results here and it is completely understandable.  It was created as Jackie's ode to racing analogous to Steve McQueen in Le Mans (1971).  Chan had a contract as spokesman with Mitsubishi (which allowed him nice little goodies like have access to prototypes and even Jackie Chan Limited Edition EVO vehicles.) which you would see prominently in this film as well as many other films of his.  But with his previous ankle injury in Rumble in the Bronx forcing him to be doubled by Chin Kar-lok in many of the action scenes and a runaway budget because of the expenses of filming in Japan where transport costs alone were quite high (they would finish the driving scenes in Malaysia) I am sure Chan was worried this was going to be an expensive failure and his own personal Howard the Duck (1986).  At the time it was the most expensive Hong Kong film costing about 25 million US Dollars (near 200 million HK Dollars) with the demolished cars about 2 million of that.  Opening day it took in a then record breaking 4 Million HK dollars and overall took in 45 million HK Dollars.  While it was never going to make its money back from the Hong Kong market, if they had worked more on the script and had a better finale it might have had better success globally.

Because of deadline issues involving this film, Sammo Hung was asked to choreograph the fight scenes.  This was the first time Hung and Chan had worked together since the lovely (sarcasm) Island of Fire (1991).  If you look at the credits you will notice several action choreographers, several car stunt coordinators, three script writers and Gordon Chan as director.  But Gordon Chan lost or never really had control over this film and the movie feels too much like the American idiom took many cooks in the kitchen.

The script is the rub.  Jackie Chan stars as Jackie Foh a racecar driver, mechanic, detector of illegal street car modifications for the police and, of course, martial artist who is highly protective of his two sisters and somewhat of his dad (director Chor Yuen.)  He runs afoul of Warner Cougar Kaugman (Thorsten Nickel) when he chases him an ultimately gets him caught by the police in an actually decent racing sequence.  He helps get him arrested and later lies to cop Steve Cannon (Michael Wong) about seeing him hit a policeman.  Cougar is not angry about being put away.  He only wants to race him and beat him.  To make sure he races him he escapes a high security jail, kidnaps Foh's two sisters, and puts his dad in the hospital while almost killing Jackie by ripping his makeshift house apart.  This will lead to a showdown in Japan between the two.  Obviously there is much more to the plot but there are so many loose angles, unneeded characters and boneheaded decisions that to chart it would make it look more convoluted than a chart explaining the sleep levels in Inception (2010).

Besides the script woes there is also a powerhouse of acting between Michael Wong and Thorsten Nickel.  Almost like a dream team of Marlon Brando and Charles Laughton.  Wong shows the worst way to hold a pistol which reminds me of the Simpsons episode Trilogy of Error quote Hey Chief, can I hold my gun sideways?  It looks so cool. Wong is also faster than bullets.  He also pulls out a gun on an unarmed Jackie Foh.  I have picked on Wong in past reviews, but he can be effective in such films as Beast Cops (1998: also by Gordon Chan.)  However here the acting is atrocious from many of the actors.  This can be forgiven if the plot was more coherent and not seemed like it was made from several screenplays put into a blender and then pasted together by a non-literate drunk or like a pop version of the Exquisite Corpse (see Mysterious Object at Noon (2000) or better yet watch something else.)  Probably best to put away the logic detector when watching this.  Also put away the critical detector as well, especially before the finale.

The pachinko parlor fight scene is awesome and is rightfully the most well-known aspect of this movie.  Ken Lo (Jackie Chan's bodyguard at the time) is quite an accomplished kicker.  While this does not top his work in Drunken Master II, he is always fun to watch.  The wirework is effectively done here used mostly to emphasis severe blows and helping out with airborne combination kicks.  Almost for this scene alone I can see why this film was nominated for Best Action Choreography for Hong Kong Film Awards though I am begging to feel that High Risk should have been nominated instead (Rumble in the Bronx would win).  It won that category for the Golden Horse awards.  Because of the previous ankle injury he is doubled much more than usual throughout the film in the fight scenes.  It could have done without the prolonged shaky slow motion that plagues the rest of the film.  But the inventiveness and that beautiful climatic scene of spherical destruction elevates this to one of the best choreographed fight scenes of the year and most likely a scene you will want to replay several times.

This is not a good film and one of Jackie Chan's worst of the 1990s.  It has a porous script (Thorsten Nickel stated he never even saw a script) and a hilarious use of a deux ex machina, bad acting, not a particularly good soundtrack for the film with an occasional soft piano that feels like it belongs in a 1970s Hollywood comedic drama, a ponderous pace, and a poorly editing and undercranked racing finale that felt more Benny Hill than Days of Thunder that should have been the highlight of the movie.*  Why add a comedic romantic aspect to what is supposed to be a serious race?  The movies redeeming values is an excellent pachinko parlor fight scene, one good fight scene within the garage and one bodacious house destruction scene giving new meaning to phrase mobile home. Unfortunately there is not much more though unless you like Michael Wong and I know you do.

I have the New Line Home Entertainment R1 Enhanced DVD.  There is an English dub and a Cantonese dub.  The Cantonese dub is preferable because you will hear a combination of Japanese, English and Cantonese that was spoken during the filming.  There are three subtitles: one Spanish, one for the English dub and one that is more appropriate for the Cantonese dub which avoids the phantom titles lines spoken only in the English dub but does not show any English spoken but still appears to be dubtitles.  You can hear Jackie Chan's real voice in the Cantonese dub where he speaks both English and Japanese as well, though he is not in the English dub.  The menu only gives you one choice of English subtitles, but depending on which language you choose it seems to choose the correct pairing.  This is a dual-sided disc which one side has the widescreen (2.35:1) and the other one has the full-screen.

* Producer Chua Lam explained in an interview in Jackie Chan: Inside the Dragon: If you go to Japan to shoot, you'll know why things cost so much.  After shooting there for a few weeks, there were so many injuries and costs ran so high that we had to move to Malaysia to finish the scene.  In slowing down the cars, we could shoot everything just once, and then speed it up for the finished product.",1452124800,,7245,4.607170693686672

2062119,2,B00024E67W,"Jackie Chan flicks rarely escape my notice.  Especially one from the mid-'90s, where his output was consistently exciting.  I had heard so little about ""Thunderbolt"" that when I found it used/cheap I had almost completely forgotten that it even existed.  For a few dollars I couldn't pass it up and while I don't necessarily regret purchase, the ambiguity of the film's hype became more and more apparent as it played.  To call this uneven would be a drastic understatement.

The film starts in Tokyo where Hong Kong mechanic Foh (Chan) and his team are working at a Mitsubishi testing facility before heading home, where he resides with his father and two younger sisters.  When not working on cars he helps local police nab fast & furious street racers.  While out with the fuzz one night, a driver known as Cougar (Thorsten Nickel), who the cops are already after, leads them on a high-speed chase that results in one dead officer.  While revealing his impeccable driving skills, Foh helps capture Cougar, who wants nothing more than to get out of jail and race Foh at some big rally, back in Tokyo.

The opening credits should've indicated that something was off, as director Gordon Chan's (""Fist of Legend"") name appears several mentions before ending with ""A Jackie Chan Film"". I brushed it off and watched anyway, wondering about a half hour into the thing why I hadn't heard more about this flick, as I was totally into it.  ""Not enough fights"" was the hypothesis I used to temporarily comfort myself.  That theory was contradicted within a few minutes by a terrific Chan-against-many fight that, apart from a few dubious camera angles, was flawless.  Now I couldn't give crap-one about auto racing but this flick was rockin' until, just moments later, it takes an abrupt turn with Foh fabricating a statement to keep Cougar detained before an excessively violent jail-break, followed by Foh and his family being put in semi-sadistic peril.  Cougar kidnaps the two sisters and leaves pops in cardiac arrest with the threat of their death should Foh not show in Tokyo.  Foh gathers his team and goes about getting a car for the big race.

There's more involving a romance/media sensationalism subplot but fans of Chan want to see the action and, sadly, there's not enough of it to go around.  Other than the good fight that I mentioned earlier there is only one other.  While large scale and ambitious, taking place at a Tokyo casino and involving several opponents, including a group of Yakuza, its inclusion of nearly two sustained minutes of blurry slo-motion pulls the energy right out of it.  There is no climactic fight either.  It ends with a race.  A rather boring one.

In the film's defense, there were production problems galore and Chan was still injured from ""Rumble In The Bronx"" when filming took place.  But why a movie is not good should never concern a viewer.  That's for the producers.  Let Leonard Ho worry about that crap!  I would think that Chan's integrity would prevent him from doing action scenes with a double, especially during his vintage era, but nope.  This is especially wasteful when a fan like me becomes aware that the stunts & fights are a collaborative effort between the stunt-teams of both Chan and Sammo Hung!  Again on the uncharacterisic scale, Hung's choreography comes off much more Corey Yuen-like than his own history would dictate.

This Golden Harvest production comes to DVD from New Line Cinema with very good quality.  Flip-disc full or widescreen option with languages available in original Cantonese or English dubbed.  Spanish or English subtitles available, too.  No special features except for some DVD-ROM stuff that I didn't bother checking out.  This would be a good film if you could turn it off after about 37 minutes.  Everything after that is questionable and I cannot recommend it except to Chan completists.  The fact that the film is relatively humorless is refreshing but if you want to see a good, serious Chan flick with only two fights, check out ""New Police Story"" instead.

The insert looks like it was printed using a home printer. The description of the movie isn't accurate either! Jackie is described as, ""a top race car driver in Hong Kong,"" when he's actually a mechanic who attended a Mitsubishi driving school in Japan. There is no ""Triad boss from Macao"" in this movie and Jackie doesn't have a girlfriend either! I don't know where the description for this movie came from, but the creators of this bootleg version weren't even trying!

2062133,3,B00024E67W,"An odd choice it may be, but in many ways Thunderbolt is my favorite Jackie Chan film (but not his by a very long shot) even though it's far from his best. It's a very slow starter but once it gets going has some of his best stunts, not least because this time it's not played for laughs and when the punches land, people really get hurt. The step-printing in some scenes is a bit irritating and there is one obvious bit of doubling (the fight in the Pachinko parlour is partially shot with a double when Chan was in hospital: the style of fighting and movement is noticeably different), but it's a satisfyingly down and dirty car-chases-and-fights number thanks to the Sammo Hung choreographed fights and Frankie Chan's car stunts. Indeed, there's one amazing car stunt in the final race that has to be seen to be disbelieved, with car flipping over midair and landing upside down on top of another car as it races by: how the hell they shot that for real is beyond me.

Unfortunately, Funny's Taiwanese release may be the uncut Hong Kong version with Cantonese soundtrack and 2.35:1 transfer, but the English subtitles are burnt-in and thanks to a poor transfer often very hard to read.

2062136,4,B00024E67W,"Thunderbolt is made in 1994, not 1995, I'm not chinese, but I saw the movie when I was 4 years. Thi s movie is all about action and drama. Chinese people like to make movie that have action and drama, they pretty much don't care about how the viewer understand the story, but understand the action, not the words. This movie is rent if you can find them at blockbuster, but why not spent $17.99 without looking for it. If you saw the Fast and Furious, this movie made before the Fast and Furious, and they use no special effect, and the best racing movie I've ever see. But forget about the racing, is the action is very Hollywood like, not joking, it the truth. Shooting and moving house is had very good action-effect realistic movie. The moving house is when Jackie Chan's in a Truck storage and sleep in it. The Bad guy pick his room up and crush to his Father and sister roomes. But most chinese movie had few or no good guy die in the movie, because if they did have alot of good guy die in the movie,than is not chinese movie and end up like making very sucky Hollywood movie that were made by the chinese. This movie is worth your time. See it! Buy or rent's your choice. It's all about racing, fighting, shooting, Japanese gambleming, and coolest.",1177718400,,1256,4.348936170212766
2062137,3,B00024E67W,"Here be SPOILERS.

Made in 1995, THUNDERBOLT is the redheaded stepchild of Jackie Chan's film oeuvre; it's not your typical happy-go-lucky Jackie Chan flick. This film spews out a vigorous blend of frenetic car chases, pulse-pounding fight sequences, and, oddly enough, a dramatic acting turn by Jackie Chan. THUNDERBOLT tells the story of former race car champion Chan Foh To (Jackie Chan) who ends up on a gangster's crap list. It all starts when Foh, now an auto repair mechanic, accompanies his father, who, every now and then, is called upon by the police to identify specially modified cars which are then towed away on suspicion of illegal street drag racing. On one such occasion, Foh witnesses a speed racer who evades capture and fatally runs down a policeman. Later, Foh engages the same speedster in a hazardous street race and manages to lead him straight to the police, where he is summarily apprehended.

Things get even more serious when it's discovered that the speed freak is none other than Warner ""Cougar"" Krugman, an influential criminal wanted by Interpol. A bribery attempt by Cougar's henchmen fails to dissuade Foh from coming forward as a witness against Cougar. However, Cougar means to get his vengeance on against Foh and, furthermore, aims to get another shot at racing him. With those intentions in mind, he kidnaps Foh's two younger sisters. But Cougar underestimates the resiliency and determination, not to mention the driving skills and arse-whoopin' talent, of Chan Foh To...

Don't mistake THUNDERBOLT for one of Jackie's patented, lighthearted comedy-action romps. He's pretty serious here as he and the dramatic storyline dismiss all tendencies to go for the giggles. As apropos to Jackie Chan's films, the action sequences are again exhilarating to watch. I understand that some if not most of the stunts are, this time, performed by a double as Jackie had incurred an ankle injury in his prior feature RUMBLE IN THE BRONX and wasn't able to fully step up to the plate. But the stunts mostly don't suffer for it as we get to murmur appreciatively at the high standard sequences in Foh's garage and in the pachinko parlor (for pachinko, think pinball machines). One complaint is that, at times, the action director resorted to that disjointed, blurry, slo-mo stuff - I'm not impressed. Meanwhile, the film's somber tone really sinks in during Cougar's traumatic razing of Foh's residence and place of business. I had never seen Jackie so beat up and so vulnerable as in that sequence and also in the ensuing emotionally wracked scenes at the hospital. Jackie has never invested so much emoting than when he was grieving over his cardiac-arrested father or, subsequently, when he is questioned by intrepid Interpol agent Steve Cannon (Michael Wong, who, by the way, doesn't really look Caucasian).

Another move off the beaten path for Chan (or, at least, in my viewing experience of his flicks) is the minutiae in which he involves the viewer regarding race car driving. This movie contains a decided element of THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, which THUNDERBOLT does precede. There are two races showcased here: a fairly exciting one early on which takes place in the streets of Hong Kong, the other an extended (it's friggin' 13 minutes long!) official race car competition on a Japanese speedway. Now, NASCAR fans might warm to the auto chases, but, to me, it only meant that a bit of human kinetic vitality was drained away to make room for the vroom-vroom! energy of the film and, now, there's even less time for further fight scenes.

As mentioned, Jackie's acting is above par this time, and I must say the audience's viewing experience will be enchanced by screening the film in sub-title format, rather than in dub. Jackie, like most actors, instantaneously improves as an actor when seen and heard in his native language. Anita Yuen is the half-hearted romantic interest/obligatory female fluff here and plays the annoying, go-getter reporter Amy Yip, who kinda redeems herself at the end. Thorsten Nickel portrays the villain Cougar the same way a cabbage would portray the villain Cougar, and he unwittingly provides most of the rare humor that's in the film. Nickel's pretty dang abysmal.

I'm giving THUNDERBOLT three stars. I feel the only things that hold it up are Jackie's unusual foray into serious drama (which might draw in the curious) and the always reliable chop-socky beatdowns. The plot is blah, the pace of the film is jarring at times, and there aren't enough good acting performances. It's also the fact that I found out Jackie didn't do all his stunts this time out. And, maybe, in the end, I really was too disconcerted by the lack of Jackie's brand of over-the-top comedy. Yeah, maybe that's it.",1169337600,,4759,4.96486825595985
2062138,4,B00024E67W,"I was very excited when I found out Thunderbolt had finally been released to dvd.  I was only able to find this title on cable television, and to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it exceeded my expectations.  The dvd release fortunately has a sharper image quailty than I expected too (I am used to most martial art dvds still having a fuzzy quailty).  The down side is the terrible dubbing, but if you can get used to that, Thunderbolt is an enjoyable experience.

The most notable aspect of this movie is that it focuses more on racing than fighting, which is what we come to expect from Jackie Chan.  I expect that Chan has a passion for racing and cars and wanted to do this movie to have some fun with that.  If you are looking for some good ol' Chan fight scenes, there are a few that are ok.  The really good scene is a nice lengthy fight scene in a Chinese casino.  Chan fights off an army of men including the same guy he faced off for 15 minutes in The Legend of Drunken Master.

If you like racing movies, this one actually pleases.  Near the beginning of the movie is a decent street race at night on the highway streets between Jacki Chan and his racer nemesis in the movie.  The final action scene in the movie, is not a Chan fight scene or stunt, but a rather lenghty - and good - race on the race track (kinda like Days of Thunder).  The only downside to the scene was that a few shots were clearly sped up on the film, but the suspense and crashes were great.

The last thing to mention about Thunderbolt is the violence.  Its a bit bloodier than I am used to seeing for a Chan movie.  Some crazy things happen that made me squirm a bit the first time I watched this.  Apparently cable television didn't have a problem with it (ha).  I still don't believe its enough for an R rating, but its definetly more violent than most Chan films.

Overall Thunderbolt is an extremely underrated and perhaps undiscovered Jackie Chan movie.  Expect the usually cheesiness with dubbed movies here, but other than that, its a great flick.",1155859200,,2057,4.351706036745407
2062139,4,B00024E67W,"This is not your typical Jackie Chan light-hearted family-fun film (at least the ones I've seen have been). There's more than just a little violence here. I was quite surprised! The gunfight scenes and the scene of jackie getting a bloody beating by his own home (you'll have to see it) and the endangerment of his family's lives...NOT for little ones!! Not to mention the story is a bit slow-starting (they probably wouldn't be awake to see the violence anyways...not that I'D take that chance, though) but it gains momentum as the film progresses.

The action in this film is great!! The pachinko parlor scene was the hallmark of this movie (you'd think it'd be a race, since this IS a racing movie, huh go figure)...AWESOME fight scene! Cleverly planned, filled with light, sound and creative props!

Then there's the racing scene! Even though we ALL know Jackie's character is poised to win in the end, there STILL were suspenseful moments that had me on edge!!! And those crash scenes were REALLY something else!! Wow!!

It's a good mix of action, stunts and a touch of suspense (as if seeing Jackie isn't good enough of a reason)....P.S. it's got some hilarious outtakes at the end!",1151280000,3,1188,4.785365853658536

2062141,4,B00024E67W,"An odd choice it may be, but in many ways Thunderbolt is my favorite Jackie Chan film (but not his by a very long shot) even though it's far from his best. It's a very slow starter but once it gets going has some of his best stunts, not least because this time it's not played for laughs and when the punches land, people really get hurt. The step-printing in some scenes is a bit irritating and there is one obvious bit of doubling (the fight in the Pachinko parlour is partially shot with a double when Chan was in hospital: the style of fighting and movement is noticeably different), but it's a satisfyingly down and dirty car-chases-and-fights number thanks to the Sammo Hung choreographed fights and Frankie Chan's car stunts. Indeed, there's one amazing car stunt in the final race that has to be seen to be disbelieved, with car flipping over midair and landing upside down on top of another car as it races by: how the hell they shot that for real is beyond me.

Best of all, despite the listings on most sites and some of the reviews posted here before the disc came out, New Line's DVD is the uncut Hong Kong version with optional English or Cantonese soundtrack and in a great 2.35:1 transfer.",1146355200,2,1205,4.4772727272727275
2062142,3,B00024E67W,"You have got to admit it. The movie moguls in Hong kong can put a great action movie together.

All the thrills and spills you could ask for - stunning sequences of car chases, fight scenes to die for, martial arts action. The works in fact.

The trouble is the screenplay is inept as is the acting. Jackie Chan looks like he is on some sort of medication the whole time and although there is a touch of levity about it, the movie is dark and violent.

Too long too, this film is clearly being released to build on his successes in the USA and perhaps as a prelude to the release of Rush Hour 3. The bit I laughed at the most was the portrayal of the Hong Kong Governor (with the grey hair it can only be meant to be Chris Patten) thrown into the front seat by a sudden brake and humiliated with his backside in the air. Probably just goes to show what the indigenous residents thought of handing the territory back to mainland China.

Not one for the kids.",1137715200,4,957,4.184782608695652
2062143,4,B00024E67W,"This is the best version of Thunderbolt out there. New Line Cinema finally got it! This version is UNCUT, has the original language, with English subtitles, and a good quality picture!

The audio is good enough. The Dolby 5.1 English dub here is brand new and has Jackie's character called ""Foh"" instead of ""Alfred"" like in the old English dub. Even those who were speaking English originally (except the undercover cop killed by Cougar at the beginning) were completely dubbed over by new actors. Their line delivery is quite atrocious sometimes! Also, this might have been my imagination, but it felt to me like some sound effects were missing in the fight scenes for the English dub. I can confirm that the fight scene sound effects were modified slightly, as well as the score in some places, but nothing too drastic. Everyone's screams and grunts were dubbed over too! Geez, was it worth the extra work?!

The original Cantonese/English/Japanese dialog track (which contains a little bit of post-sync dubbing, but is mostly sync-sound the vast majority of the time) is given a 2.0 stereo treatment here. Sound effects and dialog are loud and clear, but the score is unfortunately drowned out!

There are three sets of subtitles for this movie. The first set is an English DUB-title, which is when the subtitles follow the dubbed script (subtitles will also appear where no one is speaking every now and then). The second set are Spanish dubtitles. The third set of subtitles are an English translation of the foreign dialog. These subtitles, however, do not appear where English dialog is spoken. And you can only select these subtitles from the menu.

BUY THIS! Let American companies know that the only videos we will take are ones that are treated with respect like these!

As for the movie itself, it's...okay. Out of 5 stars, I give it 3.5. I recommend buying this only if you're a die-hard Jackie Chan fan. For the casual fan, be prepared to see Jackie's face hidden in a lot of the fight scenes, because Jackie IS using a double here, A LOT! Even though this was released before ""Rumble in the Bronx"", it was filmed after, and he was still recovering from his broken foot/ankle. And I guess this movie couldn't wait. However, this movie has some of the best choreography EVER. Very intricate and hardcore. It's just a shame Jackie Chan couldn't do many of the cool stunts.

The car races, on the other hand, are not very good. They're obviously sped up, probably because the drivers weren't contractually allowed to go beyond a certain speed limit.",1137628800,28,2560,4.806818181818182
2062144,2,B00024E67W,"A silly story, bad acting (or should I say overacting), & overblown, unbelieveable action sequences featuring Jackie Chan, the guy who ""does all his own stunts"", being doubled throughout the fight scenes (production was rushed & Jackie was still recovering from his ""Rumble In the Bronx"" broken ankle); not exactly Jackie's best work. Recommended only for diehard J. C. fans, & even then only as a rental (there's a reason New Line Cinema, who purchased the rights to Thunderbolt way back when it was being made, never bothered to release it theatrically). Sammo Hung's fight choreagraphy is cool, though too over the top, but the editing is very choppy in an effort to make Jackie's doubles less obvious.",1137369600,,705,4.983050847457627
2062145,5,B00024E67W,"Dark Jackie. Yes, pretty much that sums it all up in Thunderbolt (A.K.A. Dead Heat), a not-so-easy-to-find film of Jackie Chan's. It was made right after his hit ""Rumble in the Bronx"" when his ankle was still broken and as I understand it (which could be wrong) Aaron Kwok, trained by Sammo Hung, did some of the stunt doubling. I like Aaron, so this is okay by me. Now, as the title states, this is not your average happy-go-lucky Jackie film. He smiles all of twice in this film, is angry and driven, and I love it!

Jackie works as a master mechanic in an autoshop his father runs. In his free time, Jackie helps the police with illegally upgraded cars. At one point, a bad guy named Cougar (What's with the animal bad guy names??) goes racing around, kills a cop at a blockade, Jackie jumps in a car to chase him down and, while not a racecar driver like Cougar, manages to best the baddie. The baddie is carted off to prison where his evil minions break him out not too long after. In the interim, a lovely female reporter stalks Jackie to get an interview about his brave act. Well, once Cougar is free, he wants revenge of course, and a rematch, so in one of the most brutal 6 minutes I've ever seen, Cougar tears Jackie a new one using a crane and Jackie's own house. Jackie's whole family is there as well, and all get the snot kicked out of them. One of his two sisters is kidnapped and one goes vegetable from shock and damage. His father, too, suffers a heart attack and Jackie rushes him to the hospital where only an injection, sneakily executed by a doctor, calms Jackie down.

Cougar kidnaps both sisters, using them as insurance that Jackie will take his challenge to race him in a high-profile professional race. (I am not a racing fan, so I'm not sure if it was grand-prix, or what.) Of course, obstacles get in the way: the reporter gets a crush on Jackie and messes a few things up even as she tries for a good story that would threaten Jackie's sisters' safety, Jackie doesn't have a car that will work for what he needs, he's in emotional turmoil over his father and sisters, etc... How does it end? Watch and find out! As an avid Jackie fan, I own most of his movies and this one is in my top fave 8. It's awesome and I love Jackie's darker, angstier side. (He's scary when he's mad.) Plenty of action, too, and one of the coolest fights scenes ever in a casino full of Pachinko games. Don't get this movie hoping for light and laughs, it's not like that. This is grittier, edgier and awesome. (Though many claim this is movie is just a shameless plug for one of Jackie's other passions, racing.) I don't even mind the small romance subplot. Get it!",1132876800,12,2673,4.354709418837675
2062146,1,B00024E67W,"This review pertains to the crappy product from the CineVu edition.

WARNING:  This is the worst DVD version of a movie I own (over 200).  Shame on Amazon for selling such low grade product (the movie is most definately not remastered).  When I found this movie I was excited to order it after watching the TNT version with dubbing and clear picture.  The ""remastered"" picture looks like someone recorded the master copy from a VCR tape that had played on a loop for 15 years.  Totally unwatchable.  You can't even read the subtitles half the time because they are so washed out.  I felt the pit of my stomach drop when the credits came up.

Now out 15 bucks, though a cheap lesson was learned:  Amazon does not check the products for accuaracy.
