2984308,5,B000WMA6HS,"Congratulate Fox on separating their enormous full collection of Ford's work at the studio with three smaller but potent boxes:  The Classics, The Silents, and The Comedies.  Although these classics have already been issued, the addition of 1939's ""Frontier Marshall,"" which was the precursor to ""My Darling Clementine,"" in a beautifully remastered version, and the documentary ""Becoming John Ford"" are worth the price of the whole set (I bought it at Amazon for $24.99!).  In fact, the Ford documentary also includes ""The Battle of Midway"" with additional footage, ""December 7th,"" and the much-neglected ""Torpedo Squadron"" (1942). Commentary has also been added to ""Drums Along The Mohawk.""

All these films represent ""must have"" classics for your collection.  The packaging is compact and colorful.",1202428800,28,800,5.524590163934426
2984309,4,B000WMA6HS,"I can only assume that the apparent short shrift that Ford's arguably finest film, ""Young Mr. Lincoln"",seems to be getting from the ""Ford at Fox"" folks (it's not included in the ""Essential Ford"" box, and seems to have  been only begrudgingly included in the main set)is due to a possible licensing agreement with Criterion, who put out the (excellent)double-disc release of the film last year. Since I already own the Criterion disc, I guess I just resent the implication that ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" is somehow considered ""essential"", and ""Mr. Lincoln"" is not..Oh well, a minor quibble, I suppose. I wish Fox would include Dwan's ""Frontier Marshall"" in the main ""Ford at Fox"" box (as they apparently are in the ""Essential Ford"" set)..But when all is said and done, who cares?

Included are:

2984344,5,B000WMA6HS,There is no one better then John Ford....  And all of the movies in the set are classic's that everyone should see.  Grapes of Wrath most of of all.  This movie is a look at our history from a very bad time and it is very relevant to what is going on in our world now.  Besides one of the best directors ever a collections of some of the best talent.  I very much recommend this to anyone who is interested in great movies that are not just about special affects.,1416441600,3,463,4.043956043956044
2984345,5,B000WMA6HS,"So far I have only watched ""The Grapes of Wrath"". It is one of the most heartfelt movies you will ever see. The Joad family struggling through the hardships of the dust bowl and depression are forced to begin new lives out West. The journey and what they had to endure are like, ""wow"". What is really incredible is that there were thousands of families and individuals who endured these rough times. The camps in California that they had to survive in were kinda horrific...the way they were treated. Only getting paid 2 cents for every crate of fruit they picked...unreal. Henry Fonda at his best by far...one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie makes me appreciate what I have when you behold what little they had...yet they moved forward....amazing testimony to that generation's tenacity and fortitude to overcome the difficult trials that life threw at them. I am looking forward to watching the rest of the movies in this collection. If they are all as good as this first film it is a collection worth keeping and watching over and over",1412985600,2,1053,4.697297297297298

While Ford's Westerns are probably better known than his other films, ""The Quiet Man"" pairs John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in a wonderful story....perhaps not politically correct today, but worth watching for the cinematography, humor and Irish settings.",1402704000,,394,5.238095238095238
2984347,5,B000WMA6HS,"I did enjoy this DVD set, especially, ""My Darling Clementine"", which features Henry Fonda, as well as others.  I thought this was a good set of early John Ford films.  I found this to be a good addition to my library.",1395619200,,217,4.2682926829268295
2984348,5,B000WMA6HS,"Great to have a batch of John Ford classics all gathered in one box. No need for me to write volumes about the brilliance of Ford and his films. The more times I see them,  the more I marvel at the quality and fully understand why he is a filmmaking legend.  This collection contains genuine classics: The Grapes of Wrath, How Green Was My Valley and My Darling Clementine.  Also the rather unsung but very good Drums Along the Mohawk and the terrific Nick Redman documentary Becoming John Ford which includes his wartime documentaries. There's lot of fascinating extras including extensive audio commentaries on all the features by such Ford experts as Joseph McBride, Scott Eyman, Redman and Julie Kirgo, The excellent Daryl F. Zanuck: 20th. Century Filmmaker biography is also in this collection.  Added is a bonus disc Frontier Marshall, directed by Allan Dwan, an inspiration for Ford's later ""Clementine"".

However, this box also contains Ford's hard-to-find award-winning documentaries, December 7th, Battle of Midway and others. That's what caught my eye, here.  Evidentally, the movie master was never happier when he was on-the-scene, holding the camera to his eye (and, at one point, taking shrapnel for his troubles!)

2984377,5,B000WMA6HS,"Sifting through the various packages which are available on DVD of John Ford's filmaking at 20th Century Fox, this set is probably the one which offers the most reliable entertainment, the highest standard of films and the best value. It is worth noting that all of the films, with the exception of ""Frontier Marshall"" (not a Ford film), represent Ford at his best while he worked within the constraints of the studio system (not necessarily a bad thing) and in collaboration with Darryl F. Zanuck, the studio head and as strong minded as Ford. All of the films have extensive and informative reviews under their individual titles, so here a few random comments:

- ""Frontier Marshall"", a B grade western directed by Alan Dwan, is a precursor to ""My Darling Clementine"". It demonstrates the difference between an assembly line western with a tight budget and the achievements of Ford with a much bigger budget and a much better cast for the lyrical ""My Darling Clementine"". Everything about the latter is superior, possible with the exception of an amusing Binnie Barnes in the part modified for Linda Darnell which Darnell played so artificially.
- Ford preferred not to work with conventional stars and Claudette Colbert undermines ""Drums along the Mohawk"". While she acts the part, she never looks the part. With her reputation for vanity, the false eyelashes etc are absurd.
- ""How Green was My Valley"" contains a really good commentary with geriatric Anna Lee, one of the stars of the film, adding her comments.

All of the prints are in great condition and the documentaries provide invaluable information about the films, the studio and Zanuck. The dud of the set, if you discount ""Frontier Marshall"", is the documentary, ""Becoming John Ford"", a prototype of pretentious and tedious film making. You will learn much more about Ford himself by watching the documentary attached to ""How Green was My Valley"" in which Roddy McDowell, Maureen O'Hara and Anna Lee appear or listening to the very detailed commentary on ""My Darling Clementine"".  This disk also contains a pre-release cut of the film and the differences are carefully analysed. It gives a rare opportunity to understand how Zanuck could use his editorial skills to enhance a narrative.",1231804800,24,2252,5.016042780748663
2984378,5,B000WMA6HS,"John Ford and Frank Capra were masters of their craft and all of their films from the 30's and 40's still hold up today.  In this  Ford set I particularly enjoyed How Green was My Valley and the Grapes of Wrath because issues they dealt with are as current  today in 2008.

Bravo!",1207958400,5,280,4.226415094339623
2984379,4,B000WMA6HS,I'd previously seen all these movies and played one of the DVDs after buying the set.  Image quality was very good for a remastered 70 year old film.  Amazon shipped super fast even with free shipping.,1207699200,9,201,4.555555555555555
2984380,4,B000WMA6HS,"Buy the box set for ""Clementine"" and ""Grapes of Wrath"".  The other films are mediocre.  Ford and John Wayne (instead of Henry Fonda) make a better boxed set with their western triolgy plus ""Stagecoach"".  But, I did not hesitate to buy this set.  Here's what you get: ""Frontier Marshall"" with Randolf Scott is not Ford's best, nor does Scott stand out as Wyatt Earp.  It is a highly fictionalized part of Earp's life, which begs the question ""Why not film Earp according to the facts of his life?""  It looks like it was done by all concerned to fulfill studio contracts.  'My Darling Clementine"" is closer to the Earp saga (roughly 30% accurate).  Forgetting that it is about a fictional Wyatt Earp, the western itself is one of Ford's best, and Henry Fonda's best.  The cinematography is surperb, but the absence of multiple close-ups is notable, and regrettable. Also, Ford disagreed with the final cut.  Included in this box set are Ford's original film scenes without the additional music and added scenes -- you might agree that his version carries more impact.  ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" is rather boring, which is a surprise for a John Ford film, and the genre.  There is no build up to the indian battle scenes, therefore no excitement, no anticipation.  It is a routine melodrama about a married couple on the frontier.  Nothing special.  At any time during this film, you may feel free to get and go to the kitchen and order a pizza, without missing anything important in the film.  ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a standard John Ford drama. The critics have vacillated over the years with regard to the quality of this John Ford film.  It has never received a ""10"", at the most a ""7"" and with the passage of time, today a mediocre ""4"". ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" is a powerful film, both for Ford and Fonda.  Critics have claimed that Ford was pro-communist, or at least an extremely pink socialist.  The film definitely cries out for the workers of the world to unite.  As a depression era drama, it hits all bases to tear your heart out. The cinematography is matched only by ""Clementine"".  But in this film Ford paints graphic pictures with close-ups of every lead.  At times it is almost film noir. It is better casted than any other film in this boxed set.  This film is a definite ""10"" and has stood the passage of time to keep it in the top 100 films of all time.  It is said that Stalin's favorite American picture was ""Clementine"" and FDR's was ""Grapes Of Wrath"". It is recorded that both watched their Ford favorites over 20 times.  Perhaps FDR was inspired to formulate his ""New Deal"" after the 20th viewing.  Buy this boxed set used, to get full value.",1203033600,13,2666,4.571729957805907

It is worth noting that all of the films, with the exception of ""Frontier Marshall"" (not a Ford film), represent Ford at his best while he worked within the constraints of the studio system (not necessarily a bad thing) and in collaboration with Darryl F. Zanuck, the studio head and as strong minded as Ford. All of the films have extensive and informative reviews under their individual titles, so here a few random comments:

- ""Frontier Marshall"", a B grade western directed by Alan Dwan, is a precursor to ""My Darling Clementine"". It demonstrates the difference between an assembly line western with a tight budget and the achievements of Ford with a much bigger budget and a much better cast for the lyrical ""My Darling Clementine"". Everything about the latter is superior, possible with the exception of an amusing Binnie Barnes in the part modified for Linda Darnell which Darnell played so artificially.
- Ford preferred not to work with conventional stars and Claudette Colbert undermines ""Drums along the Mohawk"". While she acts the part, she never looks the part. With her reputation for vanity, the false eyelashes etc are absurd.
- ""How Green was My Valley"" contains a really good commentary with geriatric Anna Lee, one of the stars of the film, adding her comments.

All of the prints are in great condition and the documentaries provide invaluable information about the films, the studio and Zanuck. The dud of the set, if you discount ""Frontier Marshall"", is the documentary, ""Becoming John Ford"", a prototype of pretentious and tedious film making. You will learn much more about Ford himself by watching the documentary attached to ""How Green was My Valley"" in which Roddy McDowell, Maureen O'Hara and Anna Lee appear or listening to the very detailed commentary on ""My Darling Clementine"".  This disk also contains a pre-release cut of the film and the differences are carefully analysed. It gives a rare opportunity to understand how Zanuck could use his editorial skills to enhance a narrative.",1231804800,24,2252,5.016042780748663
3218875,5,B000WMA6HS,"John Ford and Frank Capra were masters of their craft and all of their films from the 30's and 40's still hold up today.  In this  Ford set I particularly enjoyed How Green was My Valley and the Grapes of Wrath because issues they dealt with are as current  today in 2008.

Bravo!",1207958400,5,280,4.226415094339623
3218876,4,B000WMA6HS,I'd previously seen all these movies and played one of the DVDs after buying the set.  Image quality was very good for a remastered 70 year old film.  Amazon shipped super fast even with free shipping.,1207699200,9,201,4.555555555555555
3218877,4,B000WMA6HS,"Buy the box set for ""Clementine"" and ""Grapes of Wrath"".  The other films are mediocre.  Ford and John Wayne (instead of Henry Fonda) make a better boxed set with their western triolgy plus ""Stagecoach"".  But, I did not hesitate to buy this set.  Here's what you get: ""Frontier Marshall"" with Randolf Scott is not Ford's best, nor does Scott stand out as Wyatt Earp.  It is a highly fictionalized part of Earp's life, which begs the question ""Why not film Earp according to the facts of his life?""  It looks like it was done by all concerned to fulfill studio contracts.  'My Darling Clementine"" is closer to the Earp saga (roughly 30% accurate).  Forgetting that it is about a fictional Wyatt Earp, the western itself is one of Ford's best, and Henry Fonda's best.  The cinematography is surperb, but the absence of multiple close-ups is notable, and regrettable. Also, Ford disagreed with the final cut.  Included in this box set are Ford's original film scenes without the additional music and added scenes -- you might agree that his version carries more impact.  ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" is rather boring, which is a surprise for a John Ford film, and the genre.  There is no build up to the indian battle scenes, therefore no excitement, no anticipation.  It is a routine melodrama about a married couple on the frontier.  Nothing special.  At any time during this film, you may feel free to get and go to the kitchen and order a pizza, without missing anything important in the film.  ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a standard John Ford drama. The critics have vacillated over the years with regard to the quality of this John Ford film.  It has never received a ""10"", at the most a ""7"" and with the passage of time, today a mediocre ""4"". ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" is a powerful film, both for Ford and Fonda.  Critics have claimed that Ford was pro-communist, or at least an extremely pink socialist.  The film definitely cries out for the workers of the world to unite.  As a depression era drama, it hits all bases to tear your heart out. The cinematography is matched only by ""Clementine"".  But in this film Ford paints graphic pictures with close-ups of every lead.  At times it is almost film noir. It is better casted than any other film in this boxed set.  This film is a definite ""10"" and has stood the passage of time to keep it in the top 100 films of all time.  It is said that Stalin's favorite American picture was ""Clementine"" and FDR's was ""Grapes Of Wrath"". It is recorded that both watched their Ford favorites over 20 times.  Perhaps FDR was inspired to formulate his ""New Deal"" after the 20th viewing.  Buy this boxed set used, to get full value.",1203033600,13,2666,4.571729957805907
