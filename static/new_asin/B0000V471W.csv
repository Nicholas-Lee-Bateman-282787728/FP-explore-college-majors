1948433,5,B0000V471W,Got hooked on him years ago with tapes from our local library. Glad to see that the individual mysteries are on DVD at a reasonable price.  A different take on crime solving from that era and Sir Derek Jacobi has Cadfael down pat.,1307491200,,230,4.348837209302325
1948434,4,B0000V471W,"If you've read the books, then this series will definitely appeal. It's a great interpretation of the Cadfael stories and there is plenty of attention to detail.

In particular, Abbot Radulfus, Prior Robert and Cadfael himself all have perfect castings.

The only downsides are that the relationship between Cadfael and Hugh doesn't really take on a life in this series - they tend to find themselves more at odds with each other than they do in the books and there are some very strange name and plot changes that deviate from the genius of the books.

If you can just ignore those details (or if you haven't read the books) then you'll love watching this.",1176681600,,657,4.695652173913044

8003388,5,B0000V471W,"Excellent. the right guys come out on top. The time is correct, and the attitudes are right for the era ( in which people didn't think they had a right to live forever ), a strong start for a great series ... sammy",1414540800,,214,4.0
8003389,5,B0000V471W,"Like forensics? Try this series on for size! We're talking 12th century forensics and a new way of seeing things. Great series, great actors. 12th century England never looked better!",1391817600,,183,5.133333333333334
8003390,5,B0000V471W,"Cadfael Is always down to earth and practical:
that's why I like Derek Jacobi's portrayal of
his character before the Reformation",1379203200,,129,5.190476190476191
8003391,4,B0000V471W,"I am never disappointed in Brother Cadfael movies.  The mystery who will be killed, who did it, how will Brother Cadfael find the murderer all add to the appeal.  It is so interesting to see the monks go about their lives cloistered away from the world but not quite something always happens to interrupt their peaceful contemplative existence.  I highly recommend the Brother Cadfael movies.",1363392000,,392,5.0
8003392,5,B0000V471W,"My sweetie got me into this when it first appeared on TV.
I'm not usually into mysteries, esp. murder mysteries; but the acting and cinematography is awesome.
Now that I own the entire BBS production of Ellis Peters' stories; I'm going to have to read the books.
Anything that translates this well to a television format must be a great read.
It doesn't matter if you like murder mysteries or not; this series is well worth watching.",1360540800,,433,4.636363636363637
8003393,5,B0000V471W,"If you are a Cadfael fan, then this one will really please you.  This is one of the more tense and better plotted of the Cadfael mysteries.  The choices of Cadfael also make this a stimulating piece on an intellectual level because you realize that during that time frame what he did was dangerous.  Politics is the name of the game in this storyline.  There are factions who are for and against the king.  Cadfael is only for Him...his king.  The title of this episode makes sense almost immediately and therein lies the clue to a problem.  In the midst of battle, someone has been murdered.",1349913600,,592,4.528301886792453
8003394,5,B0000V471W,"There is really nothing of significance that can be said after Atheen M. Wilson's excellent review of this film other than to suggest that people seeking an opinion of the film read this review. This is the first film in the Cadfael TV series, although it is the second book that Ellis Peters wrote about this rather clever and worldly, although also religious, monk. Thus, the producers of the film used it to inform us about Cadfael's past as a knight during the crusades and his fighting in Jerusalem. It is now 1138 in England. Cadfael is told to bury 94 bodies of supporters of Queen Maud who had been hanged by King Steven, but discovers that there are 95 bodies and one was not hanged. The plot reveals much about the civil war between Maud and Steven, about how Hugh Beringer becomes a friend of Cadfael and is appointed sheriff, how Cadfael saves huge amounts of money for Queen Maud, a woman, and a man, and solves who killed the 95th man and why he did so.",1343260800,2,967,4.438202247191011
8003395,4,B0000V471W,"The basic premise is that Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) is a Benedictine monk in Shrewsbury Abby. The year of this episode is 1138, but I think this was the first in the series. He saw a lot of life before he joined the order, and is very good at observation and deduction. When King Stephen (Michael Grandage) orders the execution of 94 ""traitors,"" Cadfael is given the task of arranging for the burial. But there are 95 corpses: one too many. He examines them all and finds that while 94 did indeed die by hanging, one died by garroting. But when Cadfael points out that there has been a murder victim placed among the corpses of the prisoners, the King and his sheriff are inclined to treat it as trivial. However, Cadfael points out that this would be bad for the King's reputation, he is given four days to discover the facts of the murder and the murderer. After that, the King and his men are moving on, presumably the murderer among them.

I did not understand the politics of it, but apparently a good many people in Shrewsbury believed that King Stephen was not the rightful king, and attempt to smuggle some treasure to Queen Maud in Wales. I didn't follow that part at all, but just kept track of who was on Maud's side and who on Stephen's. Or appearing to be, in either case.

Needless to say, Cadfael finds the murderer, who is brought to a 12th century sort of justice.",1336780800,,1378,4.442687747035573
