2633444,5,B000HC2LX0,"This series on the Natural world is as good as it gets ! Anyone who has not viewed this magnificent set of DVDs has no idea what they are missing.

The recent series ' Planet Earth ' - also remarkable - is not as intense, is not as defining, and is not as awe inspiring as is this production !
Secondly, the Planet Earth item focuses more on the action of the predator claiming its victim ... I assume to match today's demand for violent, shocking viewing. This Atlas of the Natural World avoids this unnecessary predator/prey activity, going only as far as showing up to where the prey will notescape - moving on without the blood, gore & deaths. A very pleasant surprise to those of us who realize this predator/prey activity is there but don't need to always see the details of the killing/death.

All of that, plus the man who has no peer - David Attenborough !

Being an educated, professional male of 60 years, I can say this : I have NEVER seen better than this program on the natural world ... EVER !!
Words such as ' stunning, breath taking, awe inspiring, and beautiful ' would be the ones I will use to describe this outstanding & refreshing product !!",1207353600,6,1163,4.4
2633445,4,B000HC2LX0,"I knew prior to ordering this set, sight unseen, that it would be very good but it surpassed my expectations. The BBC is probably the foremost producer of outstanding nature documentaries and in this series lies the proof. The BBC Atlas explores how geology, and human history among other factors formed the Continents as we know them today. It covers how humans altered and adapted to life in North & South America and Antarctica with fabulous visuals and amazing photography. Ranging from pre-history right up to the 21st century we see how man and animals have co-existed through the ages and adapted to the environment as it has gone thru various changes. All the various narrators of segments are excellent, especially Sir David Attenborough. I highly recommend both sets.",1196553600,13,777,5.0310077519379846
2633446,5,B000HC2LX0,"This series has very good explanations of how wild life is affected by the environment; how it affects their life style, behavior, diet, etc. The greatest diversity of environments and creatures of any nature series I have ever seen. Fantastic cinematography. No gory scenes of predators killing prey. Just a broad coverage of the web which makes up all life in the Americas. Many of the natural  environments and life styles are now extinct and can only be seen in this nature series. A scientific presentation with great humor and appeal. I own a large library of nature and wildlife DVD; this is one of the very very best. I have waited for this one to come out on DVD for a long time.",1189123200,12,688,4.548387096774194
8138193,5,B000HC2LX0,"I hink the BBC Atlas series is the best they ever done, even better than Planet Earth. You can actually see scenes in Planet Earth that were taken from the Atlas Series.",1526428800,,169,4.3125
8138194,2,B000HC2LX0,Lots of yak and not much cool videography. Very heavy on native Spiritism... seems like propaganda for all non-christian circle of life sorts.,1522281600,,142,5.217391304347826
8138195,5,B000HC2LX0,"This is a large compilation of several documentaries produced over the better part of two decades.  The BBC's treatment of  this type of material changed along the way.  The earlier films on North America and Central America were in part historic and ethnographic, describing how humans used and often exploited the wildlife they encountered.  Those two documentaries also described how European settlers (mostly English, French and Spanish) exploited and brutally subjugated the native populations in their territories.  At times, the narrative was painful to watch.  The story of the domination of native peoples by European and American (United States) settlers is important and needed to be told to correct the inadequacies of the history books used in grade schools, but it was just not what I bought this series for (i.e., nature documentaries).  Nevertheless, ""Wild South America"" and ""Life in the Freezer"" were both amazingly beautiful, and well worth buying the collection for.  In general, the collection will provide viewers many hours of interesting and informative viewing.",1498348800,,1086,5.461077844311378

8138199,5,B000HC2LX0,"""Wild South America"" makes it worth; great documentary, recommended for all ages, this continent is beautiful and unexplored, buy it!!!",1389657600,,135,5.8
8138200,4,B000HC2LX0,Great cinematography and narration. Some of the footage is very old though. But the length of the video makes it a great value. I like the extra information pop out windows,1380758400,,172,4.580645161290323
8138201,5,B000HC2LX0,"This video is great! I ordered it when I watched the one I bought before this. And it was way worth it. It's just as great as the first one I ordered before it. If you look into it you'll see what titles it has and the episodes are in each disc. I love this video and I'm going to get the rest of them for my collections. You'll love this video just as much as I have and I promise you , so will you. A wonderful six disc set for a great price. If your a wildlife fanatic like me, buy this set and enjoy watching them over and over again. You'll love it like I have.",1356480000,,566,3.764705882352941
