8527289,4,B00006LPGE,"A rare teen slasher type of flick from Korea. I saw this one at a special midnight showing shortly after its release there. In accordance with US-made horror/slasher films, the cast is a group of 20-somethings and the most promiscuous are the ones that don't make it to the final credits

The group who met through an Internet chat room, decide to spend the summer together at a rented beach house to get better acquainted with each other. Apparently though, a former member of the chat group who used the screen name ""Sandmanz,"" committed suicide when he was ousted from the group and has the others divided over why he chose to take his own life. The killings continue one-by-one until the remaining members of the group believe Sandmanz is actually still alive and in their presence. The prime suspect leads you to believe he's too obvious to be Sandmanz, but don't forget, that same premise was used to make you think that Billy Loomis couldn't have been the killer in the first film of the Scream trilogy.

Kim Min-seon, who's probably the best known of this cast, is limited to the film's opening scene, where her character is the killer's first victim. Lee Eun-ju, who committed suicide in February of 2005, has a very brief, non-speaking role at the end of the film. However, it wasn't until after her death, that I saw her listed as one of the film's ""stars.""",1441756800,,1368,4.648760330578512
8527290,4,B00006LPGE,"Took me a long time to purchase this just because I was basing it off most of the bad reveiws on this. I'm not sure what was so bad about this, I really enjoyed it. There was plenty of scares and nudity. This was a good homage to 80's slasher films and South Korea didn't dissapoint on this one.",1426550400,,295,4.016949152542373
8527291,2,B00006LPGE,"At first glance ""Bloody Beach"" (""Haebyeoneuro gada "") looks like it might be a good bit of escapism slasher-horror.  A bunch of cute girls at the beach running around in bikinis and getting killed in new and interesting ways...hey, it's a classic formula.

The only real twist on the formula is the premise of internet chat groups.  The kids of ""Bloody Beach"" are a member of one such chat group, dedicated to swapping advice on beach trips, and they decide to meet in real life for the first time by heading out together for a beach vacation.  Even though they are a cheery bunch, the group has something of a dark secret.  One group member, who went by the user name Sandmanz, committed suicide after being kicked out of the chatroom.  Or so everyone believes!

One of the group (Min-sun Kim, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento-Mori/dp/B000FZEQFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento Mori</a>, in a brief cameo) never makes it to the gathering as she receives a mysterious email while on the train, as well as a knife to the throat.  The remaining members of the group think that she simply never showed up, and continue on their beach adventure.  One by one they receive the same email from the mysterious Sandmanz, and one by one they begin to disappear.  It soon becomes clear that Sandmanz is not as dead as everyone though, but is in fact one of the beach club themselves! Shocking!

Clearly, director In Soo Kim was attempting a home-grown version of popular films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer/dp/6305017115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/630521610X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>.  He even assembled a cast of popular fresh-faced Korean drama stars to participate, like Jae Hee, the heartthrob from ""Delightful Girl Choon-Hyang"" and Dong-kun Yang from ""White Valentine.""

Due to Korean film standards ""Bloody Beach"" is a ""clean"" teen slasher flick.  That means no nudity and very little blood.  The girls do look nice in their bikinis, and there is one changing-room scene where they are in their underwear, but that is as far as it goes. Most of the ""kills"" happen off screen as well, which means you get a close up of a scared face, a quick shot of a flashing knife, and then a splash of blood from off-camera.

The subtitles on ""Bloody Beach"" are quite clunky as well, which doesn't help the film.  It looks like the translator might be a non-native English speaker, as the phrases are awkward and the language is often far too formal for the situation.  Sometimes subtitles are off enough that they unintentionally create comedy, but here they are just...not right.

""Bloody Beach"" was actually released in 2000, only a few years after those teen slasher flicks so the movie is not quite as late to the party as its 2010 US release would make it seem.  And maybe if I had seen ""Bloody Beach"" back then I might have enjoyed it more, but it is a little bit too late for that particular zeitgeist.

With a short ninety-one minute runtime, ""Bloody Beach"" isn't too much of an investment in time but there also just isn't a lot here to recommend it.  Maybe if you are looking for a ""clean"" slasher/horror film it would be OK to show to thirteen-year olds you might give this a chance.  Otherwise there are far better films in the genre.

Oh, and a final note; The box cover for ""Bloody Beach"" has what looks like animation stills on it.  I had thought that maybe the film mixed animation with live-action, but that isn't the case.  Really, I am not sure why the box cover has so much animation on it, but it doesn't appear in the film.",1266969600,2,3813,5.14935064935065
