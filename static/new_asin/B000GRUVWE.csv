2616831,5,B000GRUVWE,"An excellent supplement for beginning and advanced drummers. Baker gives his own unique explanation of, not only  his theory; but the rudiments as well. An added plus; demonstrations of some of the finest drumming you will ever see. The exercises at the end are progressive in their complexity but are well thought out for the beginning student.
A great instructional DVD.",1357948800,,372,5.098360655737705
2616832,5,B000GRUVWE,Can someone please respond as to when this DVD was recorded. Is it an expanded interview of the famous '68/69 Good bye Cream dvd ?,1302998400,,130,4.24
2616833,5,B000GRUVWE,Ginger has a very natural approach to drum instruction without doubt one of the best drummers on the planet. All drummers whether beginner or master level should watch & listen to Ginger on this DVD. It is clear to watch and the sound is very good.,1274140800,,248,4.413043478260869
2616834,5,B000GRUVWE,"I may be a little biased as I have been a fan of Ginger Baker since his days in Cream and he was my inspiration when I first started to play so many years ago. This video really breaks down his style of playing and is a real revelation for players that have tried to copy his style by watching his concert videos or listening to his recordings. When taken in it's components his style is heavily based on the rudiments. This shouldn't have surprised me as in the ""Goodbye Cream"" concert DVD he mentions this in his interview segment but here it's broken down in lesson format and explained in great detail. He takes basic rudiments and breaks them up over the various components of his his kit making something that's usually very dry and boring sound really fantastic. He really is a good teacher. I have to confess that after high school I never used the rudiments much in my drum kit playing but Ginger really makes you realize the importance of this even to the modern drummer.

I was always impressed with the way Ginger kept his hi-hat going when both his hands and right foot are busy playing complex rhythms. He really is a true ambidextrous player and you get to see that in great detail here. I was also impressed by the fact that he plays different time signatures on his 2 bass drums at the same time. Not your average double bass player. He is the master. I also like how his left foot constantly moves back and forth from the hi-hat pedal to the left bass drum pedal and he does it all seamlessly. You'll never see his playing style better illustrated then it is on this DVD and it puts it in your grasp with enough practice. It's also worth mentioning that the special features new to this DVD edition are the slow-mo/loop section for every lesson on the DVD. This is an indispensable feature for learning these lessons.

If I had any negative to say that would be that the new introduction recorded for this DVD edition by Hot Licks founder Arlen Roth mentions that a booklet that contains all the lessons are included with the DVD. I purchased a new sealed copy and mine did not come with this booklet.

In conclusion I'd simply say the same thing the back of the case for this DVD does, ""A must have disc for all drummers!""",1273017600,4,2241,4.408212560386473
2616835,5,B000GRUVWE,"I'm not the most experienced drummer in the world, but I have watched Ginger Baker for some time.  He is just a interesting as John Bonham or Mick Fleetwood etc.  You will appreciate the lessons from this video if you are a serious rock drummer.  Cream set all in motion and this is the ""MAN"" who did it on the drums.  Lots of beginner rudiments (man that will sink it), really, you can see
why you need to practice and use them.  I've seen alot of videos where the instructor was afraid to mention rudiments for fear we would all run off and hide.  Well unfortuneately if you don't spend the time practicing them, you lose.  Great video get it, practice it, play it live for your friends,
who knows maybe it will be the difference in your attitude (about play)?",1255910400,3,762,4.361702127659575
2616836,5,B000GRUVWE,"Being a Ginger Baker fan since I was like 2, I saw this while looking for drum dvds.  He demonstrates how to apply rudiments to the kit well.  Funny thing was in the African rhythms, he had something in his mouth he had to spit out.  That cracks me up.  HE is very real, not arrogant, so it is more friendlier to work with.  Now let me get back to practicing my Mummy, Daddy's!",1216598400,2,377,4.04054054054054
2616837,5,B000GRUVWE,"To understand Ginger Baker's playing style (as opposed to merely copying it), one has to understand (at least) 3 things: 1) Drum rudiments, both as a tool of developing technique and as musical elements (applied to the drum kit); 2) African-inspired polyrhythmics; 3) Ambidexterity.

This DVD has information on all three, presented by the man himself. It is also well-annotated and has a section with slowed-down beats to help break the stuff apart. Also interesting are the parts where Baker discusses drum tuning, plays alongside a music number, and introduces a couple of creative sound effects by re-arranging some of the elements of his kit.

For anyone interested in gaining - and appreciating - essential rock drumming skills with a musical, artistic touch this is a must. Fans of Ginger Baker will buy this DVD because of his accent alone.",1199059200,14,848,5.05
2616838,4,B000GRUVWE,"I wasn't expecting much from a drummer who, while excellent, has generally played in free form, jamming type music.  I was very surprised.

Ginger does an excellent job of showing how the very basic rudiments are all you need to become a master drummer on the drumset.  He applies about a dozen or so rudiments but then shows how simple variations on them can really sound unique -- and that describes his drumming style, unique and approaching a John Bonham like simple sound which is deceptively complicated.

If you want a constant motivation to practice your rudiments, this will give it to you.  It does for me -- after 15 years of drumming.",1194134400,15,646,4.68141592920354
2616839,5,B000GRUVWE,"I'm a guitarist, not a drummer, but I purchased the Boss DR880 drum machine for some upcoming projects and needed to learn as much about drums as possible.
I bought other videos & teaching aids, but nothing was more helpful and interesting than this DVD with Ginger Baker.  Of all drummers, Ginger Baker's style has intrigued me the most, so that has a lot to do with why I found it interesting.  Buy it.  If you like Baker's style you will not at all be disappointed.  toddm7atcomcas",1187827200,10,484,4.528735632183908

8134207,5,B000GRUVWE,"Terrific DVD, exceeded my expectations. I'm not a drummer but this pulled back the curtain for me. Drumming is not a mystery now, but is even more fascinating. Really enjoyed Ginger Baker.",1434326400,,188,4.90625
8134208,5,B000GRUVWE,"I purchased this DVD. I have many hot lick videos. Seems like I will always buy the hot licks video of certain drummers of choice. But this one really stands out of all of them I would say for just the musical stand point alone. Ginger shows almost all the rudiments here with examples of how they are useful and employed to the kit with a style. Counting and understanding time signatures and the concept of how mathematical it really is yet with simplicity and how realitve each time signature is to 4/4 timing and just knowing where the 1 count is. This is drumming laid out in a nut shell. Independance. He covers that too.  If you search the knowledge to learn drums you will be shown these three to four concepts no matter where you try to find it.
I really enjoyed the source of Ginger Baker! A very interesting individual to say the least!

 -The only thing I didn't like about this package is that Arlon Roth within the intro states that there is an instruction booklet that is included with this. All my other hot licks DVDs seem to as I remember. This one however did not. I checked the dvd on my computer to see if there was a PDF file as well , but none! But at least it is edited across the screen and I have a paradiddle book so I will get by.",1430870400,,1258,4.211618257261411
8134209,3,B000GRUVWE,"Not as inclusive as it might be. If you're a drummer and a Ginger Baker fan you might want to add it to your collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED is anything from Tommy Igoe, from setting up your drum set to all points in between.",1428192000,,224,4.232558139534884
8134210,5,B000GRUVWE,I've been a Cream fan since they first got together. It's so great to see Ginger put out an instructional dvd and give us the rundown on pretty much how he plays the drums. Lots to learn and practice here. Way to go Ginger and good luck at your upcoming London concert in May 2014. :^),1397001600,,285,4.107142857142857
8134211,5,B000GRUVWE,"excellent dvd, i recomended this for all drummers, for begginers and advanced drummers, Ginger Becker i think is one of the best drummers of the world, he play in the style of rock music and jazz music, and his technique is very complete, 100% recomended!",1383868800,,255,4.688888888888889
8134212,5,B000GRUVWE,"After watching the documentary Beware of Mr. Baker, I decided to check out a little more of his drumming style.  I had low expectations for this video, but was pleasantly surprised to find it interesting and informative.  I would never have guessed Ginger was a master of the basic rudiments!  This is probably not the definitive drum technique DVD, but it was a fun look at a drummer who has played an interesting part in rock history.  Certain drummers have a style which is easy to recognize (Steve Gadd, for example).  Seeing this video reminded me of that fact because Ginger has a very distinctive style.",1379721600,,610,4.716981132075472
8134213,4,B000GRUVWE,"Ginger Baker covers every rudiment that could be used. However, the best parts are when he talks about rhythms, tunings, and double bass technique. This guy has been through a lot and knows his business. I have played drums for 40 years in jazz, rock, latin, big band, and country with some success. I still learned something. You will too.",1378339200,,340,4.683333333333334
