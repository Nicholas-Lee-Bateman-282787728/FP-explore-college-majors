8252502,4,B0013P6TLK,"For non Spanish speakers the premise of the movie was hard to nail down. There were three interwoven story lines dealing with those outside the main stream. One involved a man recently released from prison who had been a chess teacher before. A second with a social worker supervisor who is a single mother having trouble with her son, who refuses to leave his room, and with the pressures of her job. The third is about a Cuban refugee who has been in Spain for some time and is trying to get to the US where he has relatives. He smuggles Cuban cigars and other items into Spain. He is involved with the wheelchair bound wife of the man for whom he does much of his smuggling. We are never told how she came to be in the wheelchair.

There is cross contact by all of the characters as each of the story lines plays out. As with nearly all French and Spanish films there is little resolution to the situations posed at the ending other than the social worker seems to have worked out her problems with her son if not her job.

As a big fan of Leonor Watling I liked the movie with all its convoluted meandering. As in almost all her films there are the obligatory two or three nude scenes.",1372204800,,1189,4.28

The movie is dated within modern cinematic techniques in that it uses the confluence of three lives to press a story. Hopefully this is now also pass in Spain where it stuck longer than any European country since introduced into popular cinema by Amores Perros. Most of the violence here is cerebral yet tangible, disturbing and un-resolved. The characters use each other to behead their dilemmas of which they have authored. The film astutely binds a great knot to make central climactic point instead of waiting for the end. Unlike many movies where the characters centrally focus their lives on the role developed by the script,  their lives are fully occupied with real issues having little to do with the plot. The plot or story line has become a nuance for their daily idiosyncratic goings-on. A mother so entrenched emotionally with connecting refugees with lost families is 'burdened' with her son's angst and passive anger. The root of the son's rebellion? Or the reason a wheelchair bound wife has taken a lover? The answers are hinted but provide no catharsis. One thing is clear: change is painful but rewarding for those who must grow of their obsession. A subtext that is explored both carnally and psychokinetically is the meaning of love and its adequacy. The film keeps this thematic element subtextually never allowing it to crush the script with sappy unreasonable dialogue.",1364774400,,1527,4.96484375
