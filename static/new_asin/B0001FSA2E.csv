8011763,4,B0001FSA2E,"This was a great purchase.  Probably the most well done and informative instructional DVD I've watched.  Makes you want to get on the mountain!  Recommend to anyone who wants to advance their snowboarding abilities.  Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!",1285804800,,259,5.095238095238095
8011764,1,B0001FSA2E,"My first one star review:
I think I paid $5 for this including shipping, and it wasn't worth it.
Section one says the ollie is the basis of many tricks.  So, when you do an ollie, do this with the board (video of someone doing an ollie shown a couple of times)  If you want to do a backside 180, ollie, then turn your head so your body will follow.  (video...)  Front side....same thing. . .
I think that about covers it.

The section on building jumps:
If you want to build a jump, make sure the landing slopes down.  Steep and deep is best.  Use a shovel to build your jump and step on it to pack it down and make it solid.  Seriously, that's all it tells you.  None of the other sections is as good as the instruction you can get find youtube for free.  There is nothing in the ollie section telling you to shift your weight forward then back to load the tail, or to spring off the tail and pull your leg up.  On the jump building section, the kids probably don't know how to describe what they're doing in terms on how wide a jump should be, should the ramp portion be flat or concave, what is a good starting angle...  zip, nada, nothing...

Jeremy Jones on the jib section is sort of funny.  His advice, dull your edges, but not if it's a new board your mom just bought you, and don't dig in your edge, especially your leading edge, or it'll suck.  He does say some stuff about looing at the end of the rail, and he talks about how he approaches the rail making his board angle and the front of the rail a triangle, but unfortunately, it seems to be an off the cuff section that wasn't clear or well thought out.

I suspect this was a class project or something a few kids working at Burton threw together many years ago.  I know it's tempting to get this because it's so cheap, but don't.  The only good to come from my buying it is that I can now, hopefully, save you from doing the same thing.",1285459200,,1902,4.122282608695652

8011766,1,B0001FSA2E,"Laim video - alot of bark with no bite.
No technical info what so ever, just fluff.
Just some big names dudes making an appearance.

If you have never riden before and looking for inspiration to get pumped, then it may do the trick.
Or If you have riden once or twice, you may give it a try.
But being a newbie, you shouldn't be looking to do tricks anyway, your goal is probably trying to make it down the mountain without hitting some old guy and getting sued.

Otherwise, if you are looking for some useful tips to learn a trick, forget it.
By the time you are at the level to attempt to try a trick, you will probably already know what is in this video.
It is only the Basics of the basics to basic boarding tricks..
basically, it is really basic information for the non-basic boarder.
But I guess that is why it is called getting started for the beginner.
I just thought the title  meant the ""begining of learning tricks"", not ""beginning to snowboard"".
Thumbs down for me.",1198627200,3,977,4.327868852459017
8011767,5,B0001FSA2E,"I have had a chance to view this DVD twice since purchasing it last week and I'm very pleased.  Unlike most - if not all - other instructional snowboarding videos on the market, Todd Richards' Trick Tips Vol. 1 does not start the viewer with how to get into your bindings, fall over properly, and make your first frontside turn.  Richards and Co. thankfully skip over such basic knowledge (which most any rider would outgrow after two or three visits to the slopes anyways) and after a very brief segment on safety, jump right into park and halfpipe basics.  Todd and righthand man, Billy Anderson, tackle straight airs, 50/50 rails, as well as method, mute, tail, indie, and stalefish grabs, as well as other park essentials.  As for the halfpipe, Todd and Billy introduce such basics as dropping in, speed control, transitions, kick-turns, ollies, and then progress to 5 different backside grabs and 5 different frontside grabs.
I really enjoyed this video.  One of the first things that caught and kept my attention was the candid, off-the-cuff humor between Todd and Billy.  Laughs make learning easier, and this DVD is no exception.  The quality of the DVD was respectable as well.  I own a few instructional martial arts videos which look as if they were produced by the practitioners themselves with no additional or professional help.  Although you won't find any Spielbergian special effects or emotional John Williams soundtrack here, the little graphics and music that were used were modern and complemented rather than distract from the presentation of the film.
My review isn't complete without testing the taught techniques of this DVD, but being in Seattle in mid-June leaves me little to no opportunity save a lengthy trip to Mt. Hood, which probably won't happen.  The good news is this video has provided me with the know-how, inspiration, and confidence to try out these techniques as soon as I hit the hill.
This great DVD spurred me to inquire about Volume 2, and I e-mailed producer Morgan Stone of 900 Films.  Coincidentally, they were just wrapping up voice-overs for Volume 2 as I e-mailed last week.  It's essentially finished but won't be available until Thanksgiving of 2003.  Morgan wrote some of the things Volume 2 would cover, such as frontside, backside, and switch 180's, 360's, and 540's.  I wouldn't be surprised to see frontside and backside railslides either.  Maybe they'll save the inverted stuff for a future Volume 3?  If so, I should best buy a helmet, and start nailing the basics in Volume 1!",1055635200,23,2537,4.92018779342723
8011768,5,B0001FSA2E,"Who isn't?  This DVD was excellent for settling those butterflies and giving me an idea of what to expect.  It'll put you one step ahead on the learning curve.  This was my first season hitting the park and pipe.  The video was great, first to give me a little confidence and create a shred-thought (kinda like a swing thought for you golfers), and then as a review to make it automatic.  It's a real instructional video, not a ""watch someone jump off a cliff and dream that I can do that"" video.  Its only drawback--I want more!  When's Vol. 2 coming out?
Note, keep in mind that this is for beginner tricks--jumps, rails and grabs in the park and pipe.  No spins, no flips, nothing excessively extreme, so don't expect too much.  After watching it, you may think you can master most of this in a couple of days--not (I'm glad I withheld my review until after the season).
On the flip side, if you aren't confident with your edges (say, at least comfortable (not, ""well I think I can make it"") on black diamonds or difficult blues), the vid won't help you, and learning that well first on the slopes will make your (and everybody else's) park experience much nicer--remember shred-iquette.  Until then, the vid is great for inspiration.
To Amazon: the video title isn't ""Snowboarding Basics,"" it's ""Snowboarding Park and Pipe Basics.""  That's kinda like the difference between ""Jumping Basics"" and ""Base Jumping Basics.""",1049587200,22,1421,4.735772357723577
