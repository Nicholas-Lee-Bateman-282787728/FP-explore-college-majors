8243610,5,B00122M2Q0,"4 solos, each a little different with plenty of Hendrix-like phrases. The DVD is well done and easy to follow. There is no tab but none is needed with the clear explainations of each lick.",1235433600,2,188,4.4
8243611,1,B00122M2Q0,"First I wanted to say that I'm a big fun of Jimi Hendrix blues style (and also Danny Gill fun), and this DVD was a big disappointed to me.

I think that Danny gill could have done better research and take some licks and attitude from Jimi Hendrix ""Blues"" album as a sample, which fit best to the definition of ""Slow Blues"".

Second Jimi Hendrix used to play the minor and major pentatonic scale, and not major scale modes. (If we really want to stay authentic)

And the most impotent issue is that it's even close to sound or look like the late Jimi Hendrix blues style.",1234396800,2,570,4.308411214953271
8243612,5,B00122M2Q0,"First, the instuctor, Danny Gill is a very pleasant guy and has an easy, properly paced manner which makes following along very easy. I've played guitar for a long, long time, am self taught, learning by ear. I no longer gig, but, still loving to play, have recently took to picking up a few instruction DVD's to try a learn what it actually is I've done by ear all these years and so with that said, I've seen a few of these types of videos. This is probably the best of all I have viewed. If you're a young aspiring guitarist or a capable, but, unschooled player like myself you can't go wrong with this product. You'll pick up some very cool licks, facts and suggestions that will give clues to blend with what you do now. Finally, what you'll learn here with a couple of sessions will save you hundreds of hours of fretting it out yourself with tabs/CD's MP3, whatever you use. Straight up, money very well spent and I'll look for anything this guy puts out.",1231718400,,962,4.379888268156424
8243613,3,B00122M2Q0,"I bought this DVD after getting the Quick Licks Jimmy Page key of C. I had so much fun learning the other one that I thought this one would be just as good. Not the case...at least for me. I popped it in and went through the material checking out the performances. I just wasn't that impressed. Sure there is some new material and some cool licks, but overall, not that interesting of a DVD. The Jimmy page DVD had way more melodic sounding phrases and better sounding material in general. To be honest, I haven't actually made the effort to sit down and go through the lessons because I'm not that interested in the material. I wouldn't say this was a HUGE dissappointment and completely useless though. Just not what I expected.",1228780800,8,730,4.496240601503759
8243614,5,B00122M2Q0,"The Hendrix slow blues is a great way to learn the masters signature licks. Its not the exact same licks that are in Red House but I was not expecting that anyway. Its a very Hendrix sound. The only downside is that there is no tablature, but saying that, it is very easy to follow on screen. Everything is explained. I recommend this dvd.",1216339200,2,339,4.3125
8243615,5,B00122M2Q0,"bought both new Quick Lick's(2008) dvd's by Danny Gill The Jimmy Page in the key of ""C"" and the Hendrix Quick Licks in the Key of ""B""> The reason it is in the key of ""B"" is because the solo's are based on the Classic Blues song Red House. And Danny Gill delivers another great teaching performance with skill and easy to understand explainations as to how & why Hedrix used certain slurr's and string bends.
The solos learned from the dvd can be used in all types of blues soloing in all the different key's that the blues are generally played in. Here is a dvd that shows you all of the classic Hedrix'isms and unique solo structure and timming that he was famous for.

The other great offering on this dvd is the Backing Track that sticks true to the original Red House blues song. As well as the addition of blues scales taught by Mr Gill as well.

I love it and use the backing track to warm up with before playing my own creations. This will be a valuable addition to you instructinal dvd collection, and is well worth the price of admission.",1209859200,6,1047,4.309644670050761
