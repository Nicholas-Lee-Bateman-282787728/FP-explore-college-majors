843293,3,6304342098,"A suave and oh-so-manly Bedouin chief named Tamerlane (Jeff Chandler) in on the hunt for a magnificent wild black stallion, Shazada (played by Diamond), who's rumored to be the fastest in the Tunisian desert. A fiery, tomboyish redhead, Princess Tanya of Tunis (Maureen O'Hara) is also after Shazada - she wants the horse so she can outrun two brutal brothers (Lon Chaney Jr. and Buddy Baer), one of which she is being forced to marry. No one in the cast is an Arab - not even the horse - but Flame of Araby is fun 50s fantasy.

843294,3,6304342098,"Pretty mediocre stuff here. The best asset of this movie is the presence of Jeff Chandler. Chandler gets my vote any day, but not this film. If you like costumes deserts and horses you might otherwise enjoy this film. Gossamer filming at its best. Jeff Chandler was an American icon. Jeff Chandler was a rugged, virile leading man characterized by his steel gray wavy hair, high cheekbones and a muscular physique.  He starred in action films from the late 1940s into the early 60s, often as American Indians, hoodlums and cavalrymen. Not an obliging star, Chandler often rebelled against Universal's mediocre action projects he was often relegated to and was suspended on several occasions. Chandler deserved better roles than he was given in the likes of  ""SIGN OF THE PAGAN"" and ""YANKEE PASHA."" In his best roles Chandler was the introverted enigmatic and stoic leading man of high uncompromising character. This can be seen in his performances in ""AWAY ALL BOATS,""  ""FOXFIRE,"" ""RAW WIND IN EDEN,"" ""THE JAYHAWKERS,"" ""RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE"" and ""MERRILL'S MARAUDERS."" He left us much too early at age 42.",971308800,21,1107,5.005434782608695
843387,4,6304342098,"I found this movie quite funny. Maureen O' Hars delivers her typical fiery acting quite well. Jeff Chandler makes a very good Bedouin. Some of the scenes are very picturesque. Lots of laughs from Tamarlane's right hand man. Tanya's (O'Hara) father is poisoned, and her cousin demands that she choose between the two pirate captains for a husband. She abhors them both, as well as her cousin, whom she suspects of murdering her father. She plans to capture the wild black stallion and race him against the two pirate captains. She declares that whoever wins the race shall decide up in whom she bestows heart and hand. Unfortunately, Tamarlane (Chandler) refuses to yield the stallion's capture to Tanya. The two have an argument, and Tanya returns to the palace forlorn and hopeless. The ending is quite good, but I will leave it to your imagination. I would recommend the movie. It is one of the good old movies.",1413936000,5,913,4.784810126582278

843395,4,6304342098,"While I would not call this movie excellent, or even great, it's really pretty good.  I have to admire that they really didn't use a set, it was mostly shot outdoors.  Yes, California had to substitute for Arabia, but oh well.  I'm not a horse lover, but the horses were beautiful.  The only thing I can say I didn't care for was the hero, Tamerlane, for much of the movie, appeared to be much more interested in acquiring & taming the black stallion, rather than acquiring & taming the heroine, Princess Tanya.  She seemed to be the instigator of their relationship, poking & prodding him along the way.  Funny thing, Arab princesses aren't typically flame haired, so I was surprised they didn't issue her a dark wig, since I don't think she's ever colored her hair a different color for a movie.

All in all, on the 1-10 scale, I'd put this movie at about an 8.5-9.0.  Maureen's costumes were gorgeous (her costumes always were), the acting is adequate considering this movie had pretty basic plot, the horses looked amazing, and Jeff Chandler's build was stunning.  Would like to have seen some swordfighting, some swashbuckling would have been in order.  Thus the 4 star rating.  See my review of 'Bagdad', the 'companion' movie to 'Flame'.",1171152000,11,1244,4.73953488372093
843396,1,6304342098,"Regrettably, there's no provision for awarding this a zero. This film was a waste of Technicolor and an even bigger waste of the talents of its two principals. What were the directors thinking when they put two A stars, Chandler and O'Hara, in this B picture? In their utterly unconvincing and unengaging portrayal of Arabs all the participants are obliged to backwards-speak almost every line of dialogue (""How come you . . . ."").

My wife got it right when she observed that any minute Danny Kaye will pop up and show us, yes, we were right, it was intended to be a comedy. But it wasn't. Now that's laughable.",1166659200,4,612,4.5636363636363635

7868019,5,6304342098,"OK!  Am I a movie critic? No.  I do know what I like because I am a 70 year old grandmother of six and Mom of two daughters.  We are lovers of movies.  We go as a family to a lot of the blockbuster movies of today.  How about an ""old movie"" from the past, probably I would go by myself. ha-ha  Flame of Araby was a really good movie, at least to me.  The color seemed good, sound was very good and the storyline by todays' standards would seem outdated and cheesy.  I loved it.  Two of my favorite stars are in the movie.  Jeff Chandler was a poster guy for me years ago and when you add the beautiful, talented and firey Maureen O'Hara to the mix, you have a terrific movie (just my opinion)  Thank you Amazon.com for making it available for me to order and enjoy for years to come. It came securely packaged in the time frame promised.",1434672000,6,837,4.07361963190184

7868022,5,6304342098,Love this adventure/color movie starring MAUREEN O'HARA! In the early 1950's O'HARA was at the height of her mature beauty. Her beauty and the color carry the film. MAUREEN made these B movies in between waiting for her A movie assignments. It is great that she did this as it showcased her redheaded beauty to perfection. Her costumes & technicolor beauty in her Universal B movies are reason alone worth buying this DVD!,1417219200,,422,4.794520547945205
