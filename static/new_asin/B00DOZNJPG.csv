8595592,5,B00DOZNJPG,"What an underrated film.  I absolutely love horror films especially anthologies, which is difficult to find good ones.  I really enjoyed the stories, setting, characters, choreography, etc.  I do enjoy when things tie together at the end to see things as a whole.  I wanted to see more of Lacy that feisty shark that had to be my favorite story.  The first story though made me very sad, but each one is very creative.  A great addition to any collection.",1528329600,,455,4.625

8595594,2,B00DOZNJPG,"I KIND OF enjoyed it, but it wasn't scary. The last one gave me the chills but that's about it. All the other were just like ""A guy gets murdered"" or ""But the little kid survives at the end."" Really soft core tasteless stuff that has a very simple uninteresting plot. I can go to sleep the same night I watched it and even take out the garbage at like 3am. In fact, I'm going to go do that right now. Because I just watched the whole thing alone in the dark.... And I'm going outside in the dark. And not be paranoid and on edge. Meh... Just Meh, man...",1470182400,,553,4.036363636363636
8595595,5,B00DOZNJPG,"All of the shorts in this anthology film are a lot of fun.  My favorite was ""A Scent to Die For"", very funny and very gruesome.  Loved it!",1461369600,,138,3.892857142857143

8595597,3,B00DOZNJPG,"Like most anthology films, you have to take the good with the bad if you decided to watch it.  Different directors, different styles all mesh up to make an uneven film, no matter how much you try to string the story lines together.  Not bad for low budget horror, if you're a fan of the genre.",1399852800,2,293,4.214285714285714
8595598,4,B00DOZNJPG,"Saw this on the Chiller Network.  A great, original anthology.  I enjoyed every segment (which is unusual for anthology films).  My favorite segments were the first and last (Smell and Hear).  Definitely going to be checking this out on Blu-Ray.  Worth repeat viewings.",1372809600,8,269,5.162790697674419
