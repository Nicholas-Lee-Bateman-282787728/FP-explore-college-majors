8251576,5,B0013KSC38,"I bought it because I lived during the time of Norumbrga.  It brought back many fond memories of my evenings at the Ballroom
with the Big Bands and the enjoyable outings to the Park.  I have passed it around to my many friends who remember those
days , and they have loved it too.",1366156800,2,280,4.166666666666667
8251577,5,B0013KSC38,"For anyone who ever frequented the famous Norumbega Park, this video is a MUST HAVE. It's historic in its content with beautifully captured photos and films from early days right up until it closed in the 60s. If you ever rode the Merry-Go-Round, paddled a canoe on The Charles or danced to the music of the big bands at the Totem Pole, it's a trip down memory lane that's a positive treasure.",1336694400,3,393,4.472222222222222
