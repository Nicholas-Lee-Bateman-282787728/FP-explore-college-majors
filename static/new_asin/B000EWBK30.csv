Session 1-2 - Intermediate - 52 min
A simple white walled room with Romy & a muscular guy demonstrating the poses. Romy voice overs mostly only the Sanscrit names, not always the English names of the poses, she tells you when to inhale/exhale which is great, she gives moderate physical cues on how to do the pose only, there is no spirituality at all. She does not tell you the benefits of the pose & her cuing is off, sometimes tells you way before she is doing the pose, sometimes they are already on the next pose she JUST told you to go into. Though she speaks as calm as she can, I still had trouble understanding her, not do to production values which seemed moderate sometimes & high on others, but her voice itself was monotoned. I especially heard her Sanscrit names wrong & even stopped to look it up on the computer so
sure she said the wrong one, but realized on the next pose that is was just poor enunciating. The guy always uses blocks, if I state it, she uses blocks as well.
Sun Salutations - 20 min - starting at nice moderate pace she she starts with cat/cow & light stretching before slowly doing part of sun salutation A & holding downward dog for longer time. She then does full A about 4x speeding up to a power yoga pace. She then does sun salutation B also at a power yoga pace.
Standing Poses - 18 min
Triangle, side angle, warrior 2, twisted prayer/twisted side angle, half moon using wall, standing wide angle fwd bend & then pose w/1 arm over & 1 under, fingers gripping behind back & then pose w/gripping toes, pyramid pose w/blocks, revolved triangle w/blocks, tree, warrior 3 using wall, standing Padangusthasana (holding foot w/hand)  w/strap, prep for revolved Padangusthasana (bent knee & turn torso), child's, dolphin, dolphin w/1 leg raised
Seated/reclined Poses - 12 min
very low boat, knees to chest stretch, modified thread the needle, hero pose w/eagle arms, downward dog, locust, child's, bridge, sitting fwd bend, 1 legged sitting fwd bend, easy sitting spinal twist, butterfly, sitting wide legged bend
Relaxation - lying down for barely 1 min
At first she was at a good pace, but her voice seems very stiff & I didn't like that. She seems to see yoga as physical exercise, not any passion which I need to sense. She seems stiff here & there & don't think she's ready enough to be an instructor. She seems to follow the yoga pose order by the book which is good though.

Session 2 - Advanced

Relax - lying down 2 min
The first 10 min her cuing is great, when she tells you the next pose, you see them going into it themselves, but then her cuing gets worse again. She gives only the Sanscrit names most times which as I said, was hard to tell the difference which name she said as I know them somewhat by heart. I did love the flow of the poses, her not using herself & the choice of the 3 students were great & Heath & Tara were very skillful. I'd love this if I could do it w/someone else's voice over.

This dvd is good for intermediates & advanced students who don't want any cuing other then Sanscrit & some English names, only breathing help on sun salutations, basic body posture cues poses that you can pretty much see anyhow, no new age/spiritual info, emphasis on physical aspect of yoga only for strengthening/flexibility & a stiff/bored voice over.

Rest & Restore - 35 min
Romy alone in a room w/sunlight pouring in using a voice over showing various meditative poses using blankets, wall and/or blocks to either sit up cross legged in different ways, laying down sideways, using blankets for a modified child's pose, using blocks under her neck/spine for deeper stretch lying supine, etc. She speaks very fast/hurried sometimes rushes to keep up with a camera angle & you can tell she is reading off a script. Her body fidgets which does not induce calm as well as her voice is stiff.",1197763200,3,5759,4.642156862745098
8114856,5,B000EWBK30,"This DVD is the best substitute I have found for practicing at home between yoga classes or when I can't make it to class.  I have taken Romy's classes for a couple of years, and have built more strength and flexibility with her than with any other teacher.  Her classes are sequenced to warm you up properly, to build energy and avoid any strain on your joints or muscles.

The sessions are taught in a ""Vinyasa Flow"" style.  The DVD includes a level 1-2 (intermediate) session, a level 2 (more advanced) session, a ""relax & restore"" session, and pose descriptions.  The level 1-2 poses are performed by Romy and one other person; the level 2 poses are perfomed by three people, who demonstrate beginner, intermediate, and advanced versions of the poses.  The audio is in English and in Spanish.",1146787200,7,796,4.690647482014389
