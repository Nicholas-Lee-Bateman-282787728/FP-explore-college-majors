8412061,1,B00005V4Y3,"Live At Wetlands, N.Y.C. seems to fit well with the rest of the Dolemite Collection in that it is a rambling mess.  The whole thing seems to be shot in a late 80's, early 90's cheap video format.  It has that low rent look about it, which is fine, it gives it character.  The ""Wetlands"" club appears to be no bigger than a two car garage, which they frequently show the crowd who seems to be uninterested in what is going on.  They occasionally gyrate, clap or barely cheer.  Moore's hype man goes on and on for the first 5 minutes about how Moore is ""The World's Most Versatile Entertainer"".  When Moore takes the stage all he does is spew out references to how great his genitalia is, and about all the women he has conquered.  When he doesn't have a 2nd grade type rhyme come to mind about his privates; he starts singing his own theme song which seems to be mostly inaudible, something about ""..the bad man Dolemite.""  The ""songs"" he sings are just as bad as the jokes, I for sure wouldn't call it Blues.  Just a loose collection of words and phrases that do not make much/any sense.  At one point he states he doesn't even remember all the words to his own songs.  He also claims this is him restarting his career which died 35 years ago, but then all he does is make reference to the other films in the Dolomite Collection and 40 year old recycled jokes.

Don't you need new material to re-launch a career?  Moore claims he didn't even know this was being video taped and begins to insult the cameraman with bad jokes.  Then half way through the show turns into an infomercial where Moore attempts to sell ""Dolomite Back scratchers"" for $3 each, at which time he demonstrates by scratching his buttocks with one.  He then sings the rest of his ""songs"" while holding his microphone and back scratcher, until finally retiring to his merchandising table with t-shirts emblazoned with his face and Dolemite back scratchers..  My final recommendation is to stay clear of this title unless you are a hardcore Rudy Ray Moore fan or are trying to complete the Dolemite Collection to have as a conversation piece.",1290902400,,2110,4.5131578947368425
