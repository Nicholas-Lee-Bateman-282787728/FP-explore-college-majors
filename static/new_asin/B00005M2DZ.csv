8179947,2,B00005M2DZ,The quality is not as good as I expected. I have the entire loony tunes collection and many of these less expensive alternatives the sound was out of sync for a few of these cartoons. I recomend the Classic Cartoons (asin B00063QD6G) instead it is a full two hours and the quality is much better (and it is less money). Or buy the looney toons Golden Collection (it is more money this one) but the quality is good.,1099958400,3,414,4.32051282051282
