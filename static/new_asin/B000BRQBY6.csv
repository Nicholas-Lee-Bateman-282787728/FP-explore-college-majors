8091570,4,B000BRQBY6,I got this dvd when I got my first horse. I found it very helpful since I know almost nothing about training a horse and could understand the logic of the instructor. I would like to have seen a bit more on body language and utilizing a whip since I don't use a rope. Customer service was very repsonsive too.,1195603200,16,309,4.166666666666667
