5449366,5,B00ALTQRLQ,"Are you a parent and your children love the Nickelodeon animated series ""Max & Ruby""?

To be released on March 2013 is the ultimate ""Max & Ruby"" animated collection titled ""Max and Ruby: A Bunny for Every Season"" featuring 48 sweet bunny stories on four DVD's which take place during the four seasons in East Bunnyhop.

What is ""Max and Ruby""?

""Max and Ruby"" is an enjoyable, fun, animated children's series that can easily be appreciated by young and old. I mean this is in true sincerity as I have had the opportunity to watch this series when my son was 1-years-old and then most recently as my son was hooked on the series once again at age 7.

The children's animated series was created by author/illustrator Rosemary Wells who based the series on her two daughters and the experiences they had with friends and in school. The series debuted in 2002 (the pilot was shown on TV back in 2001 on Noggin) and continues to air with a total of four seasons being shown on Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon.

""Max and Ruby"" revolves around seven-year-old Ruby and her younger three year-old brother Max. Typically, the stories revolve around Ruby working on a project and Max somehow trying to get her attention (or cause a disturbance) and easily distracting her. But somehow, whenever Ruby gets into a jam, her younger brother ends up helping her out in some form.

""A Bunny For Every Season: A 4-DVD Collection"" comes with the following DVD's:

JUDGMENT CALL:

For many parents who have young children who love ""Max and Ruby"", the latest DVD release of ""Max and Ruby: A Bunny for Every Season - A 4-DVD Collection"" is probably the biggest release for the animated series yet.

Featuring a theme of the four seasons, there are so many episodes included on this latest set and will no doubt keep your children occupied during the spring, summer, fall or winter time.

If there was one children's show that I literally watched my son grow up to, it would be ""Max & Ruby"". Nickelodeon (and Noggin) had various shows for children in the early-2000s from ""Dora the Explorer"" and ""Blue's Clues"" but there was something about ""Max & Ruby"" that captured my son's attention when he was younger.

But what I enjoyed about the series is its fun but innocent nature.  Children can learn about teamwork and also brother/sister relations, decision-making and more.

It's important to note that the series is not educational in the sense when compared to ""Blue's Clues"", ""Go Diego Go!"", ""Dora the Explorer"" or ""Yo Gabba Gabba!"". There is no host nor are their characters who are directly speaking to the audience. It's a cartoon that has a simple short storyline and it helps that these episodes are short, are easy to follow and for the most part, are safe and enjoyable.

And with ""Max and Ruby: A Bunny for Every Season - A 4-DVD Collection"", you get 48 mini-episodes on DVD for less than $20.  Definitely a great price for a DVD set that your younger children will love.

Overall, ""Max and Ruby: A Bunny for Every Season - A 4-DVD Collection"" is a enjoyable DVD for the children.  If you are a parent looking for a perfect children's DVD for any season or also a fun, safe DVD for your young children, I definitely recommend ""Max and Ruby: A Bunny for Every Season - A 4-DVD Collection"".",1364601600,24,8852,4.640745501285347
5449367,4,B00ALTQRLQ,"My toddler loves Max and Ruby so when I saw this coming out I knew it would be a perfect Easter gift. I have only watched one of the discs so far: winter. My only complaint with that disc is that it has the Christmas Passed episode where they take down the decorations/tree/etc but the disc doesn't contain the actual Christmas episode where Max sees Santa.

The other issue I have is that the box does not list the episodes and there is NO insert listing the episodes. I'll have to go through the discs and make my own list. I'm surprised this wasn't included in a 4-disc set.",1363651200,4,577,4.293577981651376
5449368,5,B00ALTQRLQ,"Great collection of Max & Ruby favorites!!
Max and Ruby is not just entertaining, it teaches little ones about sharing, cooperation and family love.",1398729600,,148,5.208333333333333
5449369,5,B00ALTQRLQ,"This is a great value for how many shows they have.  We got rid of cable, but we wanted our daughter to still have her favorite show, so we got this set and another Max and Ruby set and that solved the problem for less than 1/2 the price of a month of cable.  We're watching it now.  It's a classic.",1398211200,,299,3.8688524590163933
5449370,5,B00ALTQRLQ,EXCELLENT VIDEO FOR CHILDREN AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES IT!!!!!!!!! I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL OF THESE FOR HER AND THEY AREN'T VIOLENT AND THEY TEACH GOOD LESSONS FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS ENTERTAIN!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE DVD'S!!!!!,1393286400,2,234,5.351351351351352
5449371,5,B00ALTQRLQ,"Our granddaughter just turned two and she loves Max & Ruby. We have several of the books and DVDs and she is enthralled with all of them. Max & Ruby are her favorite DVDs--she doesn't want to watch anything else. Highly recommend this and any other Max & Ruby items. The simple, low key and pleasant stories are perfect for little ones. Too much on tv/dvd for kids today is frenetically paced, high energy, loud and obnoxious. Not so with Max & Ruby. Our granddaughter is a very busy two year-old yet Max & Ruby always hold her interest without the loud, attention grabbing tactics of some shows. Sweet stories in the books match up to some of the DVDs. Max & Ruby always show tolerance and understanding even when little brother Max is getting under big sister Ruby's skin....and the stories always end up with little Max having something to offer his bigger and ""all-knowing"" sister Ruby. Our granddaughter even plays pretend Max & Ruby story lines on her own.....so fun to watch her incorporate their antics into her own play. Based on our granddaughter's love of all things Max & Ruby, I highly recommend this item.",1392336000,,1119,4.656565656565657

If you have never seen or watched Ruby and Max before I encourage you to check them out.

8553411,5,B00ALTQRLQ,"My 2 year old enjoys Max & Ruby very much. This is a good deal 4 dvds which are like 98 mins each, (392) total surely to entertain your child for a long time, ideal for long car trips also. It is a very calming show, and it is cute and fun. I would recommend for people looking into purchasing a Max & Ruby dvd, that you make sure to buy the Nick Jr versions. Not only talking about this dvd but any. The Treehouse dvds of Max & Ruby only contain 4-5 episodes which is just a waste imo since the shows are already short.
Anyways very cute show,  no issues or complaints here :D",1402790400,,577,3.9741379310344827
