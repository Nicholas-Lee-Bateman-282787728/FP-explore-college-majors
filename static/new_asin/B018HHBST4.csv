8742349,1,B018HHBST4,"I love David Dorian Ross and have many of his DVDs. I was looking forward to learning the Tai Chi 24 form. However, after ordering this set twice, I have now returned the second set because the DVDs were not produced/burned properly. They quit in the middle. This is the fault of the production/distribution company, Lightworks. I have not been able to reach them and wish I could let them know that their production process is flawed. Amazon was very efficient regarding the return process, both times.",1527206400,,503,4.793103448275862
8742350,2,B018HHBST4,"I like the content of these videos, that is wonderful, but my 2 stars is for the quality of the video. The images are very grainy/pixilated and not easy to view. I have to take all the sharpness out of my television so I can watch as a blurry image, which is better than grainy. I sent them back to get a new copy, and my second set is no better.",1523577600,,346,3.887323943661972
