4255413,5,B0043DMJKY,"This is by far my favorite Yoga DVD I own. But it is challenging, don't let that stop you, you just need to know your limit and adjust the poses to your level, which Shiva will talk about. The yoga matrix is awesome, you can select the modules you want to do, therefore creating a session that focuses on the areas you want to do that day and also lets you creat a long or short session. This is probably  not the DVD for a beginner but really is a GREAT DVD.",1316476800,2,459,3.989130434782609
4255414,5,B0043DMJKY,"Shiva Rea knows what she's doing!  Programmable workouts that work your body out and get your blood flowing.  It's just as good as a class session, only you can extend or curtail your workouts as your schedule permits.",1316131200,,218,4.7105263157894735
4255415,4,B0043DMJKY,It was a really well put together video.  But a different type of yoga than I am used to.  Easy to follow with a wide variety combos for a unique workout!!!,1308614400,,156,4.0
4255416,4,B0043DMJKY,"This will pass as a sort of taste-test;it is made up of one or more practices from some of Shiva's other yoga videos. Like with the rest of her videos you can keep your routine fresh with the Matrix option where you can combine whichever practices you want depending on your time and needs, but it also has three pre-set practices, which are all over 50mins.

So if you're new to Shiva's teaching AND are at an intermediate/advanced yoga level (most of the exercises are somewhat fast and require greater yoga knowledge and flexibility), this would be a great way to get a feel of her style and decide which of Shiva's videos you'd like to try in full(the menu tells you which video each exercise if from)",1301011200,8,705,4.5078125
4255417,4,B0043DMJKY,"This is my first Shiva Rea DVD and I am very pleased. The yoga matrix is awesome! There's lots of variety (so I don't get bored) and some unique poses or sequences that Shiva Rea offers that I haven't seen in my many years of yoga. I've had this DVD for a couple weeks, used it more or less daily (for between 30-60 minutes), and I already feel more flexible and that my strength is building. If you know what you're doing you can modify easily for the more advanced poses. I also wonder if I will ever be able to do a headstand! The best thing about doing yoga at home is that I can fit into my schedule much more frequently than squeezing in studio classes whenever I can and this DVD makes it fun and interesting. The only thing I don't love about this DVD is that there is no real easing into the practice, other than the twisting sequence, and it would be nice to have a something a little more gradual, starting with some breathing, then some cat-cows and few downward dogs, for example, would be great to get a body ready for a more challenging practice.",1300838400,26,1061,4.257425742574258
4255418,4,B0043DMJKY,"I love Shiva, live or on DVD, and was excited to get the Kalari Vinyasa that is shown the preview of the DVD. Sadly, my DVD arrived and I have yet to find this particular section in the Matrix or any of the pre-set practices.
I love Shiva's practices but am really disappointed that the preview on Amazon is not on the actual DVD. Still love the practices included but I feel really short changed!",1300752000,3,397,4.306666666666667
4255419,5,B0043DMJKY,"This is an excellent Shiva Rea DVD. I have most of her DVDs and am especially enjoying this newest one. It is beautiful to watch and incredibly challenging at times. You can make your own practice as long or brief as you like with the custom matrix or just use one of her own preset programs. I always feel strengthened, balanced, and uplifted by Shiva Rea's unique and empowering approach to Yoga, and am very happy with this latest release. I like to mix it with Rodney Yee's latest AM Yoga and his meditation DVD, for a Yin/Yang approach... Enjoy!!",1296691200,3,551,4.52
4255420,5,B0043DMJKY,I love all of Shiva Rea's dvd's and this is one of my favorites! There's over 3 hours of yoga and you can set it up to do it how you want which is amazing. I highly recommend this dvd! It's lots of fun and you'll feel great doing it. Check out other Shiva Rea dvd's as well. She's amazing and I love the way she flows all of the moves together. Amazon has great deals on her stuff so check it out.,1295827200,9,397,3.7951807228915664

4255426,5,B0043DMJKY,I love this more than any other DVD I have. After several years I still come back to it. Great if you are more advanced and want to be challenged. I rely on this pretty heavily when I need a good stretch.,1422489600,,204,3.880952380952381

4255430,4,B0043DMJKY,"I didn't love this DVD as much as her vinyasa flow DVD. Like the vinyasa flow DVD, this one is also a compilation of sequences, but sequences from previously released DVDs (including some from the vinyasa flow). That probably gives it a bit more diversity, but I think that also makes it a little more disjointed. That said, you get to pick and choose which sequences you want to do, so I guess it's really only as disjointed as you make it. I think I've just noticed myself drawn to a handful of the flows on this DVD and haven't found it as enjoyable as a whole. I LOVE Shiva Rea though. Her verbal cues and adjustments are like poetry. This DVD also has the benefit of including an inversion practice which some of the others do not.",1406246400,,736,4.340579710144928

4255433,2,B0043DMJKY,If you are looking for a inspiring but unstructured yoga format this is for you. Personally I prefer precise instruction and not the choose what you free flow of Rea's style. This is good for a meditation but confusing and all over the place as far as comprehensive instruction is concerned.,1397779200,,291,4.7254901960784315
4255434,5,B0043DMJKY,This arrived ahead of time.  It was in fine condition.  I'm very excited to use this CD.  It is a great addition to my collection,1396483200,,129,4.08
4255435,3,B0043DMJKY,It's not fun to be in down dog and have to crane your neck up to see what's going on. I will have to memorize the routine so I can stop hurting my neck to look. I prefer Kathryn Budig because she is always descriptive but has a very lovely voice! I never have to crane my neck up in an awkward way to see what I need to be doing! And I have been doing yoga for 6 years now (on and off since I was 15) but these last two years I have really stuck with it but it's important to have a good instructor that guides you properly or your left disappointed. I really wanted to enjoy this dvd.,1394064000,,585,3.80327868852459
4255436,2,B0043DMJKY,"I've been practicing yoga for over 6 years and this is different than anything I've experienced... But not in a good way. Some of her moves are impossible to keep good form and alignment in, like ""swimming"" on the floor. There is a lot of movement that is not very well controlled. I can see the appeal of this style as freeing but I feel it may be detrimental (to your practice and/or body) if you are not super aware of your own alignment.",1393372800,,441,4.261904761904762

4255438,2,B0043DMJKY,I should have followed other reviews.  This disc assumes you know her style and leaves you in the dark.  Would not recommend it.,1392595200,,128,4.521739130434782

4255440,5,B0043DMJKY,"This is a great DVD but I would say it is not for beginners or anyone who is easily discouraged. I have been doing yoga for 20 years and love this DVD, but I don't know too many people who are a flexible an Shiva Rae, so don't despair if you are just starting out. Great DVD.",1389139200,,275,3.8421052631578947
4255441,5,B0043DMJKY,"I really like this you can feel the benefits just after one time of popping the dvd in BUT it is very face paced and you need a good amount of space for these work outs, I think it's good for people that already have been doing yoga otherwise your going to be very overwhelmed it's quick and she does not explain the precise movements so you DO have to look at the screen while your on the ground spinning your legs all over the place! Overall fun but I can see this being very difficult for a first timer.",1385078400,,506,4.07
4255442,5,B0043DMJKY,Shiva is fabulous.  I have many of her CDs. She has beautiful backgrounds and is an excellent teacher.  This is just challenging enough.,1384300800,,136,4.869565217391305
4255443,4,B0043DMJKY,It's a pretty good video but feels a little to serrate from my own practice.  Not my favourite yoga video,1383523200,,105,4.25

4255445,5,B0043DMJKY,"Shiva is an excellent instructor and delivers clear cues, whether you practice Yoga for the exercise or spiritual aspect or both. Some poses are way out of my league, but she has something for everyone, offering many options without halting the creative flow of the asanas. I feel rejuvenated after a 20 minute session, and wobbly but happy after 40+ minutes. Love the way you can mix up smaller routines into a greater whole. Like any home exercise practice, don't push yourself beyond your current physical limits. I fell on my head attempting flying crow!",1378252800,,558,4.88421052631579
4255446,5,B0043DMJKY,I love this DVD. She Riva has taeken me into some fantastic asanas. I have achieved much with yhis DVD.,1375833600,,103,4.2
4255447,5,B0043DMJKY,I love this challenging yoga video. And you can customize your workout. I am a dance instructor who is looking for yoga to help with stretching and this has given me more material to use on my students.,1375315200,,202,4.342105263157895
4255448,5,B0043DMJKY,"Over the last 10 years, I have purchased several Yoga practice videos, including those produced by Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest, Tony Horton, Rodney Yee, Tony Sanchez, Shiva Rea, and Seane Corn. I have enjoyed them all immensely, yet, I have found a particular excitement following Ms. Rea's Yoga Flow, which has taken much redundant linear motions out of her practices.

This video has challenging segments, however, it also allows me permission not to push the limits, while offering me great potential for growth. A number of the postures will probably never be attained by my body, but, I am offered more gentle alternative positions.

Ms. Rea is a phenomenal athlete.",1373414400,2,670,5.081818181818182
4255449,2,B0043DMJKY,"I'm a level 1/2 so I've been doing it for a while, have a little experience but my strength and flexibility isn't great.
I was after some basic routines, mainly being interested in vinyassa, where I could strengthen and deepen my practice and got Shiva Rea because of the good reputation she has and how well her DVD's rate but, I've had it on twice and turned it off within a few minutes each time
This is yoga for an althete, someone not interested in the spiritual side of yoga and with a serious degree of strength, fitness and flexibility. Flapping my arms around vigourously for 10 minutes is not my thing, dozens of push ups with a few yoga poses in between is not my thing, the silly upbeat music is not my thing
If you're a practicer who wants a calming, uplifting but still practice which will help you improve your asanas and pranayama this is not for you, same for beginners, look elsewhere.
If you're seriously fit and want to try some yoga poses but don't necessarily want the oms and namastes then this just might be for you",1369699200,7,1039,4.416666666666667
4255450,2,B0043DMJKY,"I seriously don't understand why there is never a single solid shot of any of the poses. The camera is consistently moving, panning, fading in and out, close-ups... Just stay in one spot! She isn't able to explain things well. Even though I've been doing yoga for several years off and on, I had to stop midway and just watch to know what in the world she meant. She also moves far too fast for my tastes. There needs to be time to settle into a pose. Wouldn't recommend this video at all. I'd return it, but the video itself works, and the refund on it wouldn't be worth it.",1368403200,4,575,4.236363636363636
4255451,5,B0043DMJKY,It's fun and fresh. I love the workout options and she has lots of active new moves to challenge me.,1365379200,,100,4.05
4255452,5,B0043DMJKY,I love the yoga matrix and challenging moves.  Shiva is the best at getting you in the zone to make your time sacred.,1363651200,,117,4.086956521739131
4255453,5,B0043DMJKY,"Fast delivery, no purchase problems, reasonable price, and quality item. The DVD is exactly as the description says and I am very happy with my purchase.

4255454,1,B0043DMJKY,"the yoga itself can be a challenge, but i am picky on this dvd. her voice isn't soothing at all and she always has on this goofy fake smile. very annoying. we aren't doing yoga to look cute and smile. that is what she represents. i couldn't even make it through a workout. not recommended at all.",1361232000,5,296,4.2105263157894735
4255455,5,B0043DMJKY,A friend loaned me this DVD to try out for days I just couldn't make it to the gym. I was pleasantly surprised at the combos of workouts and the challenging poses! Shiva Rea is so inspiring and makes these moves and poses seem so easy.,1360454400,,235,4.130434782608695
4255456,4,B0043DMJKY,"I consider myself a medium to beginner level student of yoga and I found this video very challenging but not impossible.  I've been practicing on an off for years, but have recently begun practicing regularly again about 6 months ago.  The set up of the DVD is great, you can choose from so many different practices and put them all together for a 10 minute hip opener or a 90 minute session.  The music and scenery are very cool.  But she's tough.  Watch out for the surfing segment with 12 sets of 12 chatarangas.  And you'll probably sweat.  Try it in your garage during the summer!!!!",1358294400,,588,4.490566037735849

The music is great, and I feel like Shiva is an inspiration.",1350432000,,349,3.8732394366197185
4255458,3,B0043DMJKY,"This workout was too challenging for me. Many of the routines were long, which is fine for some people, but not a good idea for me. I wanted something that I could do for 10 minutes before work and 10 minutes before bed. This was not it. I am sorry that I purchased it. Additionally, I found it difficult to keep up with the instructor, which made me feel frustrated rather than relaxed. However, I didn't give it a terrible review (i.e. only one or two stars) because I can see the value in this DVD for some users. People who want a longer workout or a more physically challenging / strenous workout may enjoy this item.",1344902400,3,622,4.3247863247863245
4255459,3,B0043DMJKY,"I bought the DVD to add to my library. I have been practicing for years and am a certified instructor, but I haven't been doing much lately. I have sensitive knees and am always conscious of protecting them. Having said this, the yoga flow was kind of neat. It offered many poses that were designed by Shiva Rea, but the instruction on pose correction wasn't low. I really enjoyed the Krija beginning and the Water Abs were challenging (mentally and physically). The Fire and Water flow was too difficult for my knees as it is lots of knee balance (using the knee as balance point for the body in a lunge). The rest of it was really cool- the matrix does offer personalization and the scenery is lovely. I did wonder at one time how they rippled the sand after she walked into the mat surface..lol and I lost concentration wondering about the logistics. NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!",1343347200,2,873,4.56687898089172
4255460,5,B0043DMJKY,"First I have to agree with some other reviewers that this DVD tends to be more for the intermediate to advanced crowd. Though there are some beginner modifications, most of the routines would be generally too advanced for beginners to really get the most out of in my opinion.

That said, I think the routines are fun, challenging, interesting, and invigorating. I also think they are very classy and well done. I think she does a good job of queueing when you are going to be faced away from the screen, and I didn't find it a problem to follow.

I also really like the yoga matrix idea so I can mix and match depending on how I'm feeling that day, just do a quick 20 min or extend to 90 min if I need it. I usually prefer to do yoga in a classroom setting, but now that I am a mom it's not always easy for me to get away from home. These DVD's are my go-to when I need a yoga fix and baby is napping. I will be buying more of Shiva Rea's DVD's!",1342569600,,946,4.026595744680851
4255461,4,B0043DMJKY,Great product. I really like the matrix option to create a workout.  Would not reccomend for people new to yoga or just learning.,1335225600,,129,4.608695652173913
4255462,3,B0043DMJKY,"The DVDs are interractive and able to customize your own routine, but overall not super impressed with the workouts.

4255463,1,B0043DMJKY,I was so excited to receive this DVD and I couldn't even make it through the first 5 minutes.  Unless you are advanced in your practice - don't even bother!  I sent it back the next day.,1328572800,6,186,4.0
4255464,2,B0043DMJKY,"This is not the DVD for me. I work with and watch Yoga DVDs so that I can LEARN how to do poses, or do poses better. This DVD has little of that. The voice-over primarily tells you what pose is coming up next and how to prepare for the transition. Very little on correct technique. If you are an advanced Yogi and are just looking for different Vinyasas to try and are not interested in instruction then perhaps you may enjoy this DVD.

One thing I DID like about this DVD is the set locations are BEAUTIFUL! Also Shiva herself is beautiful and wears some attractive outfits. Definitely some eye-candy, but not what I look for in a Yoga video.",1327968000,3,643,4.31404958677686
4255465,5,B0043DMJKY,"I am a professional metaphysiacl consultant. In all my years I have never found anything as powerful for restoring energy and clearing the chakras as this DVD from Shiva Rea.

  I had the Shakti DVD which is very traditional but did not like it as much due to all the arm poses. Arm poses +severe carpal tunnel= PAIN. In Shakti also Shiva Read moved to fast for my liking.

  In this DVD however she focuses on meditation, stretching and building energy. I needed that the most esp with my job. I life coach as many as 50 people a week. That can be a huge drain on my energy. This DVD really helps me restore and recharge",1327881600,4,621,4.264957264957265
4255466,2,B0043DMJKY,"I consider myself a beginning/intermediate yoga student and have multiple power yoga DVDs.  All of Shiva Rea's DVDs seemed to get very good reviews so I was excited when my Power Flow Yoga came in the mail.  There is what they call a ""yoga matrix"" on this DVD, which lets you put together your own routine, and then there is 3 already put together routines about an hour each.  I am not familiar with Shiva Rea or any of her sequences so I chose an already put together one called Core Power.  The opening sequence was basically just doing 500 push-ups.  I'm not talking about a flowing sequence with a couple yogi push-ups added in.  It's pretty much just 12 push-ups, rest, downward dog over and over and over.  I literally could not do it.  So I stopped the DVD and decided I was going to make my own routine with the yoga matrix.  The one and only option for an opener was called Twisting Kriya so I chose that and a couple other things, pushed play.  Twisting Kriya is a sequence of throwing yourself from side to side to warm up.  By the time it was over I felt like throwing up and decided this was NOT the DVD for me.  Shiva Rea's style seems to be a lot more free than most yoga instructors and I discovered that, while good for some people, I need more structure and peacefulness in my practice.  This DVD is very challenging, which I actually love in a DVD and didn't give Power Flow Yoga 2 stars for being too hard.  I gave it 2 stars because I didn't care for the style of yoga, which seems more free-flow dance than vinyasa.  If you can, rent a Shiva Rea DVD from the library, borrow one from a friend, or watch Shiva online before buying this DVD because you really have to like her style of yoga to get anything from it.",1326240000,107,1736,4.25

4255469,5,B0043DMJKY,"I own several Shiva Rea DVDs and of course they're all great.  The one thing that makes this one stand out is that the pre-set practices are all around 1 hour long, which I feel is perfect.  I felt like the pre-set practices on the other dvd's were a little long for me.",1320796800,,270,4.0754716981132075
4255470,4,B0043DMJKY,"This DVD has 3 full length yoga workouts and you get a lot for your money since this is a combination of her fluid power, daily energy and surf yoga soul dvds.

But this yoga dvd is very very difficult and i consider myself a intermediate yogi and this was so hard i couldn't just do a few of the sections. That said the name on the dvd is power yoga and that is exactly what you get.

May be i will grow into them but write nopw they feel very difficult. But you have all the things in this dvd that shiva rae's dvd is known for, beautiful cinematography,breathtaking music and shiva's voice as peaceful as ever.

I took one star out for how difficult it is and the cuing not allowing enough time to get into a pose. Of course it is vinyasa but i still feel it could be slower and therefore add to the experience.",1318809600,3,814,4.1069182389937104
4255471,5,B0043DMJKY,"Though I own almost all of the discs that are combined on this one, I find that I use this disc. At first, I was disappointed that there was no new material on this disc (I pre-ordered it before I realized what it was), I am actually happy I got it. The yoga matrix allows me to comine short sets from many discs that I would otherwise not bother doing (by changing discs in the middle of the routine.) They basically picked the best routines from each disc, but it is just nice to be able to combine routines that I really like.",1318204800,14,529,4.145631067961165
