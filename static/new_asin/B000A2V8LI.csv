They were near the end of a short tribute to their star of the month (Dec. 2012) Barbara Stanwyck which I had seen before, so I waited to see what they were showing next.  When Ben Mankiewicz began his introduction to the movie I was intrigued, since I always thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RIDE-THE-HIGH-COUNTRY/dp/B000BT96DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY</a>&nbsp;was Sam Peckinpah's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WILD-BUNCH/dp/B000Q6GX90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WILD BUNCH</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CROSS-OF-IRON/dp/B00F5WYDUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CROSS OF IRON</a>) first film.  After watching and enjoying the movie, which I enjoyed greatly and would give 3 1/2 stars, I looked for a DVD. According to most reviews there is no decent release available at this time (except for a German import), and being spoiled from just viewing TCM's gorgeous undamaged Panavision and Pathe Color print (which might hint at a planned future ""official"" release), I will delay a detailed review for a later date.  I do, however want to explain my review title, and the inspiration behind it. SMALL SPOILER ALERT AHEAD! In the beginning of the film, Brian Keith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REFLECTIONS-IN-A-GOLDEN-EYE/dp/B007I6KMAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE</a>) walks into a saloon, a finds a man (Chill Wills (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GIANT/dp/B00GT85OLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GIANT</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-ALAMO/dp/B0048HW20C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE ALAMO</a>) in a atypical evil and, sorry, chilling role) hanging from a noose and precariously balanced on a small whiskey keg. The members of a card game explain that Chill is a card cheat, but Brian notices a scar on his wrist and begins to forcibly save him, which happens, but in a rather unexpected way. Soon after, Brian, Chill and now Steve Cochran (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHITE-HEAT/dp/B00BUALYHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHITE HEAT</a>) are riding into Gila City, and we're shown a wide shot of the town's main street, lined by buildings and busy with the hustle and bustle of everyday life, including a group of kids playing in the dusty thoroughfare. Brian is then distracted by a poignant harmonica, and the point-of-view shot moves to the upper right and we see a kid about the same age as the ruffians below, but standing on a building's roof dressed in a suit alone playing the harmonica.
