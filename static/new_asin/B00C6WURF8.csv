5692193,5,B00C6WURF8,"As a professional in the field of developmental disabilities, I am always challenged with effective ways of communicating the very simple notion that people with intellectual or developmental disabilities can and ought to be an integral part of our social universe, that they can contribute to a community in powerful ways, if we will allow that to happen, and that everyone gains from such relationships.  I have not encountered a film that communicates this more effectively than ""A Friend Indeed--The Bill Sackter Story"" which I have lent to many people who have been deeply moved by it.  The challenge is to get people to wrap their minds around the idea that someone with a developmental disability can be a genuine friend.  This film does that, and the fact that it's a documentary gives it considerably more credibility than a made-for-TV movie.  It is superbly produced and written, powerful, honest and moving.",1371427200,2,919,5.066225165562914
5692194,5,B00C6WURF8,"This Documentary tells the true story of Bill Sackter! Way beyond the films or the books, this is the real deal. A must have for fans of Iowa History, and People with disabilities overcoming all and becoming heroes. Want to help the world out a little? Buy this and show it to as many people as you can.",1370995200,2,303,4.241379310344827
5692195,5,B00C6WURF8,"This IS my favorite documentary of all time... Our busy lives get swallowed in this complex world. The need to be someone or something is totally overshadowed by this simple man's ability to overcome any and all obstacles with a smile.

Bill moves as if he alone leveled eroded bricks on his winding road that at one time only led to his own nowhere. We are blessed to be part of his ""somewhere"" and to be invited to smile along.

 Lane has spent a decade, Barry spent a few of his own to bring this masterpiece to a grateful audience.

Having bought quite a few copies as gifts for family and friends, This will be the one I ""try"" to keep!

If not, I'll keep on giving. That's simple and brilliant.",1366675200,7,699,4.305343511450381

5692197,5,B00C6WURF8,"""A Friend Indeed"" captures the influences that enabled an intellectually disabled man to become a beloved friend of many people from diverse backgrounds. It bridges the gap of fear some have of interacting with special needs populations. The documentary acknowledges the importance of community support and encouragement as well as the personal relationship. Those who ""invested"" in Bill's life received dividends that would last a lifetime. The DVD's extras provide further insights. Truly inspirational!",1365984000,4,505,5.837837837837838
5692198,5,B00C6WURF8,"""A Friend Indeed -- The Bill Sackter Story"" is, hands down, the single most inspiring documentary I have ever seen !

Upon my initial introduction to this extraordinary documentary four years ago, I promptly purchased three DVDs of  ""A Friend Indeed -- The Bill Sackter Story"" (one for my own DVD library, and two for gifts to friends).  Today, in honor of what would have been Bill Sackter's 100th birthday, I purchased six more of these DVDs as gifts of enlightenment and inspiration to even more friends and family members.

If my home was ablaze and I only had enough time to rescue five of my nearly 400 DVDs as I fled that inferno, this would definitely be among them !

Should you fail to experience the wonderfully full range of human emotions while viewing this poignant documentary, you clearly need to head down that Yellow Brick Road to beseech the Wizard for a heart.",1365724800,14,880,4.651612903225806

5692200,5,B00C6WURF8,"This is a great film. I saw the movies about Bill with Mickey Rooney from the early 80's, so I knew a little something about Bill Sackter's life. It was amazing to learn so much more about the real Bill. It was inspiring to see he was so full of joy and love, even though life had been very cruel to him for so many years. I would highly recommend this film.",1483488000,,358,3.986111111111111

5692208,5,B00C6WURF8,"I recommend this video to everyone. It is not only heartwarming, but illustrates how a simple kindness such as a mere hello can lead to improving another life forever. Most people look away from those with disabilities. This documentary illustrates How looking away not only harms the disabled. but those ignoring them as well. They are cheating themselves from knowing some of the most endearing, kind and appreciative people on the planet. A high percentage of the learning disabled can be functional and productive citizens...If only they had an advocate. A few people in this film made the decision to advocate for Bill, and in doing so, changed the lives of many. The givers of a bit of time, received just as much joy in their lives as Bill did. It is difficult to teach compassion and personal change,  but ""A Friend Indeed"" provides one of the the best examples of a starting point to begin enriching all of us who share this planet.",1473206400,,941,4.737804878048781

5692214,5,B00C6WURF8,"Bill Sackter found a lot of good Samaritans in his time here, and he made us better Samaritans by knowing him. He taught us, If you are unsure of someone , take the time to get to know them.

5692215,5,B00C6WURF8,"Bill was a dear friend of mine . . . the first person I met in Iowa City when arriving as a new Social Work student at the University of Iowa in 1976. He embodied what it meant to be fully human --- warm, caring, joyful, funny, sincere . . . He was defined by who he was and how he treated people, not by his job status or education level. He was wise and deeply spiritual --- despite having experienced so much sadness in his life he retaining a childlike sense of wonder and the ability to ""burst into song"", on his harmonica, of course!"" ""A Friend Indeed"" captures the ""REAL Bill"" through the use of actual video footage of Bill throughout his adult life, as well as still photographs and interviews with people who knew him well. I feel honored to be included among those interviewed, but more honored (and simply lucky!) to have met Bill and gotten to know him so well. Each year my band participates in his Birthday celebration, but on almost a daily basis I think of him and smile.",1468800000,,988,4.317204301075269

5692217,5,B00C6WURF8,"A Friend Indeed....I loved this documentary.  I, myself, have a son with special needs.  I teared up many times as I watched this true story of a man who had been locked away as ""usless"" in society, come out and learn to live in the real world.  I loved his humor, compassion, dedication and soft heart!  The documentary is very well done!  There are many good people in this world, both those that need a hand up and those who are willing to help. Thank you for sharing this story as it really happened! (This documentary makes me want to find the movie version of ""Bill"" to watch  how he is portrayed in that version)  But this true documentary is the best!
Please share this DVD with your family and friends. I did! The world needs to see the GOOD things that happen!",1468627200,,770,4.3426573426573425
5692218,5,B00C6WURF8,"I loved this video. It shows you that no matter what you face everyday doesn't have to be an obstacle. Also that you never know what you might do that will help others, whether trying to or not. Just because you are different doesn't mean you should be treated that way.",1468195200,,270,4.313725490196078
5692219,5,B00C6WURF8,"A Friend Indeed, The Bill Sackter Story is a fantastic documentary. The only thing that I could think of that wasn't wonderful about this film was that the introduction is VERY long and drawn out. It does set the tone for the film fairly well though, so push through it everyone, it's worth it! Bill Sackter was a mentally handicapped man that was forgotten in an institution for forty-four years. That, in itself is horrible. The few things that he is able to tell about his time there show that it was an even more horrible place to live. So, how this sweet, talented, outgoing man came from there, no one knows. The fact that he came from a place like that and ended up who and where he was is amazing. I am glad to have had the opportunity to watch this film. I watched it with my kids, who really enjoyed it and also had a lot of questions (the older one did anyway). It made for some fantastic teachable moments. This film makes you wish you could go back in time and give this man a hug, but you can't. What I can do is use his story to teach my children to have empathy and to love the special people around them, even if they do act different. How many documentaries do you walk away from smiling? How many of them make you smile each time you remember it? This one does. Bravo. Well done.

5692222,5,B00C6WURF8,"What a touching documentary! After watching this, I wish I had known Bill Sackter. The man had the amazing ability to keep a positive attitude and befriend everyone he met. He overcame the adversity of his birth defect and became someone that everyone can admire and respect. His life and his story changed the way many people look at others who have mental disabilities. What an inspiration.

This documentary is filled with anecdotes, images, video, and audio of the real Bill Sackter, who was portrayed by Mickey Rooney in a made for TV drama simply entitled Bill, which was released in 1981. Bill was fortunate to come across some wonderful people who helped him to make the most of a life that may have turned out much differently after having spent 44 years in a mental institution.

A Friend Indeed moved me greatly. It made me laugh, cry, smile, and gave me great perspective on this man's amazing journey from darkness into the light. We should all be so lucky to have a friend like Bill Sackler. I can't recommend this documentary enough.

I received the DVD free in return for my honest review. My reviews are done in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations, and I never guarantee a favorable review. I have personally tested this product.",1467072000,,1259,4.739726027397261

5692224,5,B00C6WURF8,"Heartwarming, inspirational and a beautiful story!!!
I am in love with Bill even though he is no longer with us and I love Barry and his wife and their community for being good ""real"" unselfish people. Although Bills energy is so pure, simple, loving and beautiful it's so contagious I don't think these people had a choice. He warmed won their hearts in the simplest way! As he won mine through this documentary.
I cried and laughed and was inspired and I watched all of the bonus features the end.
The difference between Bill when he first met Barry and his wife  and after is amazing! He was given love and gratitude and help setting him up with a place to live and he was able to flourish and share his love, gratitude and talents with others in a way that is very touching and will stay with me for a while if not forever.
This film is some great footage of Bill and Barry that Barry captured from the  70's and 80's which is so great!  What a BEAUTIFUL documentary film!!! 5  plus stars!!!

I was given a copy of this film to watch, review and leave my honest feedback",1466294400,,1074,4.323383084577115
5692225,5,B00C6WURF8,"This is an amazingly charming story of Bill Sackter... a gentle man who was placed in an mental institution at the young age of 7.  He spent 44 years in that institution..shut away.  It is hard to hear how he was taken away from his family at such a young age and just forgotten.  That said, the story is very uplifting.  The story's focus is actually about how happy and content Bill was, even though he had lived through such difficulty.  It inspired me in many ways.  Bill loves wigs, loves his harmonica, loves the people in his life.  He is a gentle man who is simple in many ways, but on the other hand is so wise beyond his years.

As the story goes, there is a point where Bill gets ill and the Morrow family take him in as a family member.  This transformation is lovely, and honestly is so touching.  Bill learns to make coffee and he finds that it gives him a purpose and gives him the opportunity to talk with others.  People simply enjoy his company.  He just is magical, and so many folks gravitate to him.  Upbeat, loving.  So eager to please others...thinking of others.  I wish we all had more of this perspective to life.  What a lovely and inspiring story.",1465776000,,1175,4.321100917431193
5692226,5,B00C6WURF8,"I enjoy documentaries and when I read about Bill Sacker I was interested in seeing this film.  Wow!  A great documentary that will make you laugh and cry at Bill's remarkable story.  Thank goodness for Barry Morrow and his wife and all the people who befriended Bill in his life after being institutionalized for 44 year.  A man with a tragic life beginning, we can certainly learn from his positive outlook and good heart, and the strength to look forward and not back in his life. I never saw the film with Mickey Rooney and Dennis Quaid, but I am glad I saw A Friend Indeed - The Bill Sackter Story.  Bill brought positive attention to mental disabilities, and disabilities in general. I am so glad Bill was surrounded with such good friends and was able to have a productive life after being institutionalized.  I received this DVD for free and I recommend this documentary.  It is heartfelt and will encourage people to be better humans. It certainly did for me.",1465603200,,967,4.619883040935672
5692227,5,B00C6WURF8,"I can honestly say I didn't know what to expect as I'd never seen the movie, Bill. I was very pleasantly pleased. I really don't want to go into details but, it's great how one man just simply was himself and lived his life to it's fullest. We all could learn a lot from his life and how one man overcame his difficult upbringing and won not just the hearts of a city, nation and gratitude of the president but, changed the way society treated people with disability.

You can watch it with and without commentary.

5692229,5,B00C6WURF8,"I was offered a copy of this DVD if I would give my honest opinion and review it. The DVD arrived the next day after I placed my order. Usually I get items in 2 - 3 days. Kind of surprised it came so fast. After dinner, I popped it into the DVD player. Was glad I was alone because I think I used a whole box of kleenex. Probably looked like Rudolph. My Dad always told us that it is not how much money you have, how smart you are but who you know that can change your life. He is right. It happened to Bill Sackter. Had he not had certain people come into his life; it would have been much different. I had a family member who was born with challenges and she died at the age of 22. Her mother always worried that if she died before her daughter that she would be harmed. I know it broke my sisters heart when Merle died but at the same time she was relieved. She didn't want her in a institution but took 24 hours a day care for her. So I watched this film with a different perspective than most. Even though I cried I truly enjoyed the filming and the story. Very very heartwarming and gave me hope that maybe their are still a lot of good people in the world.",1465084800,2,1163,3.953191489361702
5692230,5,B00C6WURF8,"I have seen this video many times and each time I appreciate it more.

But I was privileged to hear adoring stories of this wonderful human being.  I saw the film when it was introduced in Iowa City, purchased a DVD and also saw the film on public TV.  It is a wonderfully encouraging story about Bill and the people who knew him best.  The whole world should see this story and attempt to be the loving person that was Bill Sackter.  It is worth watching over and over.",1464739200,,548,4.376237623762377
5692232,5,B00C6WURF8,"The Bill Sackter story perfectly captures a time in our history when people were not a part of the broader community. I was familiar with the made for TV movie with Mickey Rooney but it was so much more powerful to get to see the real Bill Sackter and learn from his experiences.  Sadly, there were many ""Bill Sackter's"" that didn't make it out of the institution or weren't allowed to become the person they were meant to be.  This movie is a wonderful story of people who recognized the inherent humanity of Bill Sackter and the wonderful relationships that ensue.

As a Social Worker working with individuals with disabilities, Bill's life story gives a person a glimpse into what a person's life was like during the years people were sent to the state hospital.  Bill's story shows what can happen if a person can receive the support and love we all deserve.  I would highly recommend everyone seeing the Bill Sacter Story.  No one should forget what happened to our most vulnerable people during the years they were housed in the state hospitals.",1464566400,,537,4.621052631578947
5692234,5,B00C6WURF8,"This amazing story of an orphan who spent 44 years in a mental institution before emerging into a world he could barely comprehend and who went on to gain nation-wide fame would excel as a work of fiction, The fact that it is all true is even more remarkable. The life of Bill, self identified as a crack-headed man, never learned how to read and could only manage to write the first three letters of his name, has been exquisitely captured by Lane Wyrick using film taken throughout his life by Barry Morrow who later gained fame as a screen-writer. Here is a word of warning: when watching the film keep a box of tissue handy. A Friend Indeed produces abundant laughter but also a goodly amount of tears. In a society increasingly characterized by hatred and division A Friend Indeed offers a deeply moving story of love and joy. Dont miss it.",1464566400,,845,4.529411764705882

5692245,5,B00C6WURF8,"Bill Sackter was surrendered to a mental institution by his parents when he was very young. He grew up in confinement, and ended up living there for a total of 44 years. Eventually the policies were changed and he was released out into the world. He came to know Barry Morrow, a young college student, who helped him with some of his day-to-day challenges, but that's not really the value of this DVD.

Much more interesting is how Bill helped Barry. Though he had suffered and even been subjected to some terrible abuse in his own life, Bill lived as a constant reminder to everyone around him that the world was full of wonder and magic and good people. Even now, years after his death, Bill's positive vibe comes through in this presentation, still managing to share his energy and his love with all who see it.

Do check out this video. As Bill would say, ""It'll make you feel like two cents, buddy!""",1393459200,3,904,4.5060975609756095

5692248,5,B00C6WURF8,"I was 18 year old when the TV drama ""Bill"" aired in 1981. The movie was promoted as Mickey Rooney playing a retarded man. No other info was given. It aired two nights before Christmas. It was awesome. You got to hear that it was an Iowa story, that happened at Iowa City. The Bill TV movie beat every show that night in ratings. The next day, every morning talk show and news show was talking about it. Barry and Bill were overnight celebrities.

I am 50 years old now, and just purchased the documentary. The documentary is very moving, very touching, and the music score really is a gem. The story is a living testament on how human beings should treat each other. So many lessons can be learned from this movie, and at the same time entertains the heck out of you.

Anyone that has seen the movie ""Forrest Gump"" and has said to themselves that the Forrest Gump story could never happen will find out that they were wrong. It did happen, even before Forrest Gump was a story. In Bill Sackters case, it is not a story. It is true. That's what makes this story so special. This is a must see. I truly mean that.",1376697600,9,1111,4.285714285714286

8577837,5,B00C6WURF8,"Very touching story..
I cried in the end.
Really effected me emotionally and got me to thinking about a whole lot of things.  I'm so grateful this man had Jesus in his heart cause that's what saved him.  God blessed him in abundance with people that saw his light shine in the darkest of places you could be.
He blessed all those that reached out as much as they blessed him. A moving story..  You will look at all people in a different way now.
God bless all of you.",1514851200,,467,4.166666666666667

8577841,5,B00C6WURF8,"I first saw the documentary at the World Premiere in June 2008 and was impressed by Lane Wyrick's incredible story-telling and the music by Peter Bloesch. This film is inspiring, poignant and funny--I think Bill Sackter would be pleased! We bought the film so we could share this amazing story of friendship and how inclusion with those who have disabilities benefits the whole community. Many thanks to Barry & Bev Morrow, gracious & supportive friends to Bill and this production.",1497571200,,482,5.0375
8577842,5,B00C6WURF8,"I was in high school when the movie version of Bill's life aired on television and it left a real impression. Over 30 years later I recognized the story and ordered this documentary. Be warned that some of it is tragic and painful to learn, but there is such joy and love and hope and goodness that that will be the take away. I think this should be required viewing- as one person noted, Bill looked like a homeless and frightening man- but all he needed was someone to see beyond the surface and get to know the person. So glad that Bill found so much love in his later years.",1497139200,,578,4.216216216216216
