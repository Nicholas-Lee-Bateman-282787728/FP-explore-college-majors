2247928,5,B0007XBMA2,"""Moonlighting"" truly is one of the best television series of all time. It was extremely creative, loaded with great humor and drama, and occasionally some action and intrigue. It faltered a bit in its last two seasons, but even they are worth 5 stars.

The premise: Maddie Hayes (Cybill Sheperd) is a former model running a nearly bankrupt detective agency. David Addison (Bruce Willis) convinces her to run the agency together as partners instead of shutting it down.  They bumble their way through many mysteries, solving most of them. Maddie and David couldn't be more different - Maddie is conservative, reserved, preoccupied with being responsible, and slightly repressed and uptight. David is spontaneous almost to a fault, and not terribly responsible.  These stark personality differences lead to some very funny banter in every episode.  Yet, both have big hearts, and over the course of Seasons 1 and 2, they fall very much in love - even though they cannot admit it - especially to themsevles.

In the typical episode, David and Maddie work on a case. However, there's much more going on. Events in the case parallel events in one or both of the main characters' lives, or their relationship with each other.  It's obvious that the writers, directors, cast and crew are having a great time making this show.  The writing is very clever, and as the series progresses, the characters occasionally show awareness that they are characters on a television show - to great humorous effect. In later seasons, there are episodes that have themes - such as a black and white film noir take-off, and a hilarious modernized version of Shakespear's Taming of the Shrew. In its first two seasons, Moonlighting is a bit more conventional - though still innovative and still one of the finest television programs ever.

Moonlighting has other strengths.  One is Agnes DiPesto, the delightfully quirky receptionist that answers every phone call with a different rhyme.  Another is a roster of great guest stars, like Orson Wells, Tim Robbins, Dana Delany, Whoopi Goldberg, and many more (and the ones I named are all in the first two seasons, so you'll be seeing them on this DVD set).  Moonlighting also features great music - not just the classic theme song by Al Jarreau.  Nearly every episode has great classic tunes.  The first two seasons include songs by Little Richard, Patsy Cline, Smokey Robinson, Otis Redding, The Rolling Stones, The Temptations, The Isley Brothers, and Gene Kelly, and many others.

The picture and sound quality are excellent for a 20-year-old TV show, and better than when these episodes were broadcast on Bravo in recent years.  This set is a great value, too, considering that you get a total of 23 episodes (all 5 episodes from the brief Season One, which began late in the year, plus 18 episodes from Season Two, which ran a regular fall-to-spring schedule).  The DVD extras are a lot of fun, especially two short documentaries (one for each of the first two seasons) that feature interviews with Bruce, Cybill, the actress that plays Miss DiPesto, and some of the writers and crew members.  They all have interesting stories to share about their experiences making Moonlighting.

Highly recommended.

If you're curious about why it has taken so long for Moonlighting to come to DVD, it's because Lions Gate had great difficulty securing the necessary rights to all of the songs featured in the various episodes.  The music came from a variety of different sources and record labels, some of which have gone bankrupt or been taken over by other corporations in the last 15 years.  A few years ago, Lions Gate considered releasing Moonlighting on DVD without music, but this was unacceptable to Glenn Caron, the series' creator.  Finally, they obtained the necessary rights to all of the songs that so greatly enriched this wonderful show. They also got Bruce Willis & Cybill Sheperd involved in some of the DVD extras, and now we can finally see the result of all this hard work!",1110067200,304,4010,4.936011904761905

2247930,5,B0007XBMA2,"I never thought I would be hearing the original theme song again.  I NEVER missed an episode of Moonlighting, NEVER!  It was a well written show that did not get enough mention.  Even with today TV, few shows can be put on the same level as Moonlighting.  This show is a must have and is long overdue.  And for those of you who haven't had the pleasure of seeing Maddie Hayes & David Addison (Cybil Shepard & Bruce Willis respectively) in action, Get the DVD, pop some popcorn, press play and wait until you here, ""Some Walk By Night, Some Fly By Day...."" Enjoy!",1109980800,14,562,4.365384615384615
2247931,5,B0007XBMA2,"Those of us that grew up watching this show in the mid to late 80's remember it fondly.  The undeniable chemisty that existed between the characters of Maddie (Cybill Sheppard) and David (a young Bruce Willis with actual hair) kept us coming back again and again, and remains one of the best TV matchups of all time.  The humor and creativity behind this series is so superior that it holds up still 20 years after its initial airing.  From the breaking of the fourth wall to acknowledge the watching audiences' existence to the almost slapstick comedy that happened in nearly every episode, this series set the bar extremely high for all series that followed.  For all that have waited patiently through all the false promises of this series being released on DVD, your patience is finally being rewarded.  A heartfelt ""Thank You"" to Lions Gate studios for finally allowing this show to finally see the light of day again on DVD.  Now they just need to hasten the release of the remainder of the seasons to DVD.  I look forward to once again seeing arguably the best episode of the series, ""Atomic Shakespeare"" (""I HATE IAMBIC PENTAMETER!"") from season 3, in all its hilarious glory on DVD.",1109980800,17,1191,4.72463768115942
2247932,5,B0007XBMA2,"It seems like an eternity waiting for this on DVD! I have them recorded on VHS but it's not the same. I hope there will be lots of extras, commentary tracks would totally rock, especially if they got Bruce and Cybill to do commentary.  I cannot wait until all 5 seasons are release so I can watch them again and again.  The best thing about this show was that it was well written and acted, witty, and broke down the 4th wall with comments top the audience, but never seemed to over use there little devices.  And the creativity, especially the episode ""The Dream sequence always rings twice"" introduced by Orson Welles (the day he died!), the Lady In the Iron Mask, and Camille (with Whoopie Goldberg!). if you are a fan of the show, Bruce Willis or Cybill Sheppard this set is a must (thank goodness it was not put out by Goodtimes Video).",1109894400,10,841,4.412903225806452
2247933,5,B0007XBMA2,"Thanks to Bruce Willis this DVD set is being released!

Can't wait!

This tv-series revolutionized television (e.g. actors talking to the tv audience). If you know it you already love it and if you didn't watch it live you have to own this set anyway. You get the most wonderful on screen chemistry between the two main characters - don't miss it. I hope they'll include many extras especially the bloopers and outtakes that aired after a few episodes - take my word for it, you WILL enjoy ""Moonlighting"".

Watch out for fabulous Bruce in ""Witness for the Execution""! Can't wait for the next set (including ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"").",1109894400,8,637,4.7207207207207205

This was the best they have ever looked and the broad spectrum of plots/spoofs took them both into every aspect of a character, from spoofing The Taming Of The Shrew, to  Play Misty For Me, and the sultry Cybil singing a torchy love song to a Bogart-Willis black and white parody. Great writing, This series paved the way for witty dialogues that you see now in CASTLE.",1407715200,,534,4.804347826086956

2247984,4,B0007XBMA2,"This show was one of my favorites growing up . . . at least the first two seasons. I can remember watching the ""TV Movie"" that was the pilot. A lot of people now don't realize watching that that a CD Walkman around that time was a big technology innovation. That pilot episode definitely had and reminds me of the ""80s feel"". Love it. Anyway the first two seasons were fun. They were fresh. But as we approached the third, fourth, and fifth seasons it was almost like the writers wanted to make people miserable (it went down hill exactly at the end of ""Blonde on Blonde"" in season 3). It was just plots designed to jerk the audience around. Also some say that it was because of a writer's strike. Obviously that is not true. Some say it was because Shepherd was pregnant. I never got that one. If she can have her parts ""in Chicago"" with the parents why not in LA? It was totally bad writing and bad writing decisions. I was turned off by then. It was only now all these years later that I have actually seen some of the later episodes and even know how it ended. And by that time Willis was a big movie star and rubbing elbows with Hollywood. So their acting/chemistry was the equivalent of sleep walking to me. But the writers totally ruined what was a fun show by by the end. I can see why it ended. At least they all stayed with the show to the end. Not something that most do started around that time and to date.",1402531200,2,1419,4.220588235294118

The whole series was great, except the last year--it did not quite measure up and it was time to end the series. They were both ""naturals"" in their roles.

2248005,1,B0007XBMA2,"""Moonlighting"" was a great show.  Bruce Willis, back when he was cool.  Cybill Shepherd, back when she was relatively young.  Shepherd was never a great actress but she did have the knack for looking good on camera.  And she and newcomer Willis had a good chemistry in the show.

The best asset to ""Moonlighting"" was the writing.  Of course, it was cutting edge for the time, and that which is closest to the cutting edge dulls the fastest.  In many ways the show ""Moonlighting"" was cloned from, the already successful ""Remington Steele,"" holds up better in retrospect.

While there was much breaking of the ""fourth wall"" (such as talking to the camera, reference to the script or the writers, etc.) Willis and Shepherd never broke character.  And sometimes the writers were simply intent on showing what wiseacres they were, such as producing, out of nowhere, a show modeled after a Shakespeare play.

Seasons one and two are really the first six episodes (a pilot t.v. movie and five additional episodes in the first season) and a full season.  Well, as full as ""Moonlighting"" ever got.  Based on the first six episodes, ""Moonlighting"" promised to be one of the best series ever.  And the second season seemed to confirm it.  The third season started well, introducing Curtis Armstrong (""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Better off Dead"") as a love interest to the receptionist, and ""Atomic Shakespeare.""  Then, at the end of season three, the show started to wobble and it never recovered its balance until it limped away for good after season five.

The first three seasons of ""Moonlighting"" are still pretty good television, compared to what we have in the twenty-first century;  and this is not nostalgia talking.

But the DVD to ""Moonlighting"" has proven very disappointing.  I have had two sets of Seasons 1 & 2 and disk four on each one refuses to load or play.  And I had the same problem with disk three of season 3;  only, watching the shows in order, I had Season 3 too long to return it!  Bummer.

One bad disk 4 in a set might happen by accident.  But having the same disk refuse to work twice, plus a disk on the next season doing the same?  I never had that trouble with ""Remington Steele"" or any other show I've tried.  It sounds like shoddy workmanship on their end.

So, beware.  It's a great show, but the DVDs are rip-offs.",1350345600,6,2339,4.65281173594132

2248009,2,B0007XBMA2,"Judgement: RENT, don't BUY Season 1 and 2. The episodes are too uneven, two boring one and two average ones for every good episode. I normally transfer my DVDs to digital files to run directly off my computer's huge 2 terabyte hard drive used for storing videos; this gives me more freedom to choose what to watch. After watching Season 1, only 2 episodes remain (judged re-watchable). Season 2 has four episodes remaining on the drive.

Rationale: David Madison reminds me too much of my most obnoxious students - who badger and annoy when they are told NO as they try to get you to change your mind. Gee, am I describing a BRAT? When Maddie says NO to David, off he goes into his badgering - sometimes he is funny (in Season 3 he is funny) but most times NO. Personally, I feel no empathy for Maddie since when David starts his brat mode it is a sure thing that she will give in.

Comedy: Physical comedy is the show's major comedy strength; most of the verbal comedy seldom works (the quips remind me of the style used in the Die Hard movie series by Bruce Willis). The absurd seems to be the key to the better episodes - greater absurdity often leads to fun.

Detective Strength: No sleuthing depth, it is just a facade for the interplay between the characters. This is not Columbo!

Acting: The leads are good actors and what they are asked to say is the weakness. David trying to be extra cute with his quips seldom works. The support actors, especially in the Blue Moon office are excellent and add fun to the episodes.

2248013,5,B0007XBMA2,"At its best, Moonlighting channeled the scenes from His Girl Friday where Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell famously smart talked right over the top of each other for line after line of dialog. Moonlighting became famous for that, as well as other bizarre but interesting and amusing behaviors from the leads and the agency staff.

At its worst, in the last couple of seasons, Moonlighting became brooding and somewhat depressing. Of course, as with many shows like this, the never released sexual tension between the male and female leads (David and Maddie) was what drove the show. The show ""Jumped the Shark"" at the same time the writers made the mistake of letting David jump Maddie. It was all downhill from there.

But the first seasons were glorious and inventive, some of the best TV series entertainment ever.

2248014,3,B0007XBMA2,"I remember greatly enjoying this show in the 80s, saw it on Amazon for a good price, and so bought it. Someone else mentioned the packaging is chintzy. Yup; but I didn't buy it for the packaging. The biggest reason to buy this DVD is: Cybill Shepherd. They dress her beautifuly and every head shot of her is a money shot. She's just gorgeous. She also has a youthful gee-whiz way of delivering her lines which is very fetching. Bruce Willis' character is OK. If I remember that this was the 80s, and a child of its time, the gimmicks are easier to tolerate. Their sexual chemistry is often entertaining, but sometimes too cute by half. The biggest negative of this show (first two seasons) is the poorly written plots. There are holes in the logic you could drive a truck through. Several times I barked at the TV an exasperated ""Give me a break!""

They did do some innovative things in this show: inside jokes, talking to the camera, allusions to movies, etc. I don't disparage that. And there is a large dose of crackling, sometimes simultaneous, dialogue between the two principals. And did I mention Maddy is gorgeous? The down side: it can get old, and stupid plot development.

How unique the show was.  Just because of the characters Maddie & David & how the show was written.

Course, we can go into the later seasons when none of the seasons had the normal.

The banter between the characters.  A totally 1980's show.  The music.  The woman's clothes

I know there are a lot of comic elements to the show, such as Miss DePesto (but her voice is so grating, all the time!) and the characters talking TO the camera and TO the audience, but I think the show could have been better without these elements.  More of a concentration on the business side of things (such as the cases they have to solve, for example, and why there are so many employees doing nothing) could have made the show stronger.

So a while later I finally decide to watch it, and just before I start the first disc I mentioned this to my mom.  She says that I loved this show when I was little.  I personally don't remember it, but ok, I believe her,  but I'm still not expecting much from this oh, so 80s looking show.

After starting though, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the banter between David and Maddie.  They are both hilarious in their biting, witty sarcasm.  And once they started referring to the fact that they are in fact on a tv show, and this might be a little risque considering they're not on cable, etc, they truly won me over.  Now I'm looking forward to getting the rest and listening to them talk their way out of more trouble and into more cases.  And the only time the fact that it was filmed in the 80's stood out was when I paid attention to the wardrobe.

2248019,1,B0007XBMA2,"I ordered and received from Amazon Moonlighting Seasons 1, 2, and 3 in two different disc binders, each of which was sealed with shrink-wrap plastic. These containers, before they're opened, are very pretty to look at, with Bruce and Cybill shown as die-cut figures against the NYC skyline and an enormous harvest moon. (So far, so good).

I discovered, however, once the plastic wrap was broken on the box containing 1 and 2, that the cardboard-and-plastic binder for the discs was extremely poorly designed and manufactured. When I opened the booklet, two of the plastic inserts holding discs pulled free from the thin cardboard spine acting as a hinge, and they clattered to the floor. I own hundreds of DVDs in just about every kind of DVD container ever designed. And this is probably the worst of the entire lot. The only thing securing the plastic inserts to the cardboard folder is a thin bead of what appears to be rubber cement, which I was able to pull free of the cardboard like a stretchy worm.

I didn't view the videos and didn't open the second package. Within hours of receiving it in the mail, I attempted to return all of it for a refund. When I encountered resistance on the Amazon return site (which wouldn't provide a UPS return label), I phoned the company and explained the situation. The person I spoke to also resisted me, but after some discussion, he agreed to make it right and provide a refund. I certainly do understand that Amazon is not a free lending library for DVDs. I'm not at all sure that Amazon understands that a customer can have a truly valid reason for returning an opened DVD and requesting a full refund, or that the DVD container is just as much a part of the purchased product as the DVDs themselves.

The only effective way to hold together the components of seasons 1 and 2, once they're opened and have fallen apart, is with several rubber bands. If you're fine with that kind of workaround, you may find the product to be a good bargain. Since I haven't viewed the videos, I can't comment on that aspect.

The manufacturer must have gotten a clue by the 5th season to keep the package straight forward and safe for the disks. The packaging for Seasons 1-4 are bare cardboard covers with glued plastic pages that fall out as soon as the shrink wrap is removed.

Ms. Shepherd is certainly beautiful to behold, and, unlike many runway models, she has acting talent and intelligence.  She is what makes this work--for me, at least.  Mr. Willis isn't bad (pardon the litotes), but the writers made him just a bit too smart-mouthed with the wisecracks.  That wasn't the actor's fault.

The stories are full of action, which sometimes or often takes the place of genuine drama.  Unfortunately, moviemakers frequently do this, and perhaps that is what many viewers want.  Real drama takes place behind the eyes and countenance of good actors, not in gun duels or fistfights.  Alas, subtlety is lost on many.

2248036,5,B0007XBMA2,"Twenty years down the road, here's how Moonlighting holds up:

Brilliantly.

Who would have thought that Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, essentially playing themselves, would have fallen so easily into the modern-day Nick-and-Nora routines created for them by an amazing stable of writers?  Yet they did, and the writing is a big reason why.  Alternating goofball antics, look-arent-we-silly scenes with truly moving ones, the Moonlighting creative team made Maddie Hayes and David Addison one of the great showbiz couples.

Not everything worked.  The pastiche episodes, such as the homage to Taming of the Shrew and the black-and-white noir tribute, flirt with brilliance, and one is indebted to Caron and Co. for being so audacious as to try such innovative stuff at all.  Some of the self-consciously cute bits -- reading fan mail, talking to the camera -- get a wee bit tiresome, but once Maddie and David get back into the whirl of their latest case, it's all good again.

Others have noted that the series went downhill quickly because of Caron's unwillingness to adhere to network budgets and timetables,  Shepherd's and Willis' egos, etc.  In later seasons, Allyce Beasley and Curtis Armstrong carried many episodes virtually alone, and while both were charming in small doses, they reached overkill quickly.  More critically, although the sexual teasing between Maddie and David was a powerful force in the show, Caron and the writers didn't know how to keep them apart forever.  Once David/Maddie finally hooked up, everything REALLY became problematic, starting with that famous seduction scene as Maddie/David knock over furniture to get to each other -- at the time, Moonlighting fans were uncomfortably aware that Shepherd was pregnant with twins during all that knockabout filming!  Then Caron and Co. really didn't know what to do with their characters, introducing one weird plot twist after another to reconcile the Maddie/David situation, all the while relegating the mysteries to the background.

And we fans just sighed and waited for the end, which wasn't long.

But the glory of the series is probably enhanced by its brevity.  For its first three seasons, this was the best show on television.  And watching it now, you'll be amazed at how the writing and directing match the best of what's on contemporary TV,  minus the tons-of-violence that modern tastes demand in such shows -- violence which would, in the case of Moonlighting, have merely gotten in the way of much more interesting goings-on.",1199836800,3,2525,5.177339901477833
2248037,5,B0007XBMA2,"Well, one can really tell the ""life"" of a concept or product by the reviews and timeliness of it being reviewed.

As, I tend to review a lot of ""oldschool"" DVD sets, due to my own habits, its nice to see this product so much in the collective ""now"" of so many fans.

This show is ""timeless"" need-less-to-say.  The humor, the mix of personalities between the characters Mattie and David, the story-lines, the constant breaking of the 4th wall, between the actors and the audience.  It all boils down to great humor and a great show.  I recommend this highly to all lovers of great television programming.

2248050,1,B0007XBMA2,"I Netflixed this and was surprised at the results. Cybil Sheppard was likable, but Bruce Willis, the one for whom I thought I'd like the show FOR is abrasive (not ""fun"" abrasive) and generally hammy. I could not like the show because I could NOT like his character. Worse still, the chemistry between the two is simply cold and awkward. Totally lacking the spirit and warmth of Remington Steele and Miss Laura Holt. The humor is grating and sometimes embarrassing.

For some reason certain shows just seem stuck in the time period they arrived in and Moonlighting is by far one of the, uh, stuckiest. The sound cues feel like they were yanked from Terminator One (not a good thing).

There is a brief interview section on Disc One where they brazingly put down other shows of the time period and gloat on how they created something ""different."" If cold, dated, and impersonal is ""different"" than I guess they did. I would wager many here who give this 5 stars viewed it in its original time frame and have been fans all along, though I must say looking at this from the outside, it is quite honestly, a train-wreck.

2248052,5,B0007XBMA2,"Moonlighting is a smart & sophisticated show that debuted with a short six episode season in 1985.  The show revolves around Maddy Hayes (Cybil Shepherd) a fashion model who is bilked out of her money by a shady accountant.  She is forced to start selling off her assets, one of which is the Blue Moon Detective Agency.  She is going to sell that as well until she is drawn in by the charismatic David Addison (Bruce Willis).  She joins the agency and together they get involved in screwy cases.  The sexual tension between Maddy & David is the crux of the first two seasons.  The will they or won't they vibe permeates the show.  The show itself harkens back to the witty comedies of the 30's & 40's where the banter between David & Maddy is smart and high-brow.  The show had some quirky episodes like a flashback to a 1940's murder show in black & white (and containing an introduction by Orson Welles).  The show was a critical smash, but did not catch on with the general public in large part to numerous production delays that postponed many episodes and stalling any momentum the show gained.",1140566400,2,1099,4.538071065989848

2248055,4,B0007XBMA2,"Moonlighting was a television show that premiered on March 3 1985 and was carried by the channel ABC.  It lasted through five seasons.  Moonlighting is a perfect example how good writing, talent and chemistry come through and have TV viewers wanting more and more of one show.  Moonlighting is also a perfect example of how can a top show reach bottom and fail to further please the audiences, due to lack of commitment as well as evaporation of that magic chemistry.

It is a long awaited event by fans throughout the world.
Moonlighting is finally out on DVD.  Personally, I have had it with my videotaped versions of the show.  I needed to relive the magic of that show from the beginning through the help of a Digital Version.  The Episodes run very wonderful and it is a pleasure to hear crystal clear the musical theme on every beginning.  The picture is crystal clear and the audio is digital stereo (not 5.1 surround as it is stated by the technical characteristics).  Still, at some points you will notice the audio changing from stereo to mono and stereo again.

Another issue that comes up in this DVD collection of the two first seasons is the fact that some episodes have been altered.  It seems ridiculous to have episodes altered when transferring to DVD especially if you examine the reason that this is done.  For example, in the episode ""A funeral for a doornail"" in the sex shop scene, there is furniture superimposed in front of Maddie the moment she is reading a dirty magazine.  Clearly there was no reason for that type censoring because the front page of the magazine was visible and at the bit offensive for the prudish back in the `80s.  Was there a legal issue with the magazine this time around?  One can only speculate.  And why did they provide us the classic episode ""The Lady with the iron mask"" with a newly recorded soundtrack?  Was it that difficult to gain the rights for the musical themes that were played on the original episode?  For people who are new to Moonlighting such issues may be trivial, but for people who have fond memories of that TV series such things matter.

So what can we do?  We were so anxious for the release of Moonlighting so we can not be stopped by such minor technicalities.  I rushed and bought the DVD collection of the two first seasons as soon as I could, not to mention I have already pre-ordered Season 3.  No true fan can be left behind from such a treat of their favourite television show.

Do I need to advertise the show?  To people who are familiar with there is no reason at all.  This show has many fans through out the globe.  Do I need to advertise the show to younger and unfamiliar generations?  Surely enough by saying that television dialogue, character development and television entertainment is at its best rolled into this old series.

We can only hope in the future that the episodes will all be restored in their original form and further more, there will deleted scenes, and there will be the teaser 15 to 30 second TV ads and much, much more.  The has to be a second time around of doing a professional job on the inclusion of all this trivia because I am almost certain that like me, a great deal of fans will buy them all over again.  Just try to keep away from anniversary editions that appear every five years and include a new item that has been recently discovered.  Pretty much, I feel we have all had it with the predatory marketing that started as a business trend during the late `90s.",1134950400,9,3487,4.522364217252396
2248056,4,B0007XBMA2,"This show, while centered around a detective agency, is really about people- Maddie Hayes (Cybil Sheppard) and David Addison (Bruce Willis).  Mattie portrays someone overly intellectual and organized while David portrays someone overly at the other end of the spectrum.  Together they show the need for both characteristics in moderation through hilarious antics caused by the extremes.  On top of this theme, there is tons of chemistry, not just between Maddie and Dave, but also between both of them and the audience.  This was the first show I could remember that broke the cardinal rule of TV and not only failed to ignore the audience, but they actually address the viewers directly at times.",1134259200,,697,5.087719298245614

The episode ""The Lady in the Iron Mask"" contains a chase originally scored to the ""William Tell Overture.""  In fact, this extremely memorable scene has now been set, on DVD, to ""filler"" music; the Overture does *not* accompany the scene on DVD.

I understand companies' concern with keeping DVDs affordable, particularly as customers can be very exacting about the amount of money they will pay for a DVD set.  So while I was disappointed (as the scene itself is one of the more memorable in the annals of television history), I accept this change and simply wanted other customers to be aware, since many companies are strangely (and unfairly) mum about changes sanctioned in the course of transferring programs to DVD.",1126396800,12,813,4.869565217391305

This collection contains the first 2 (really, first one and a half, Moonlighting was a mid year replacement) seasons of the show.  They represent the very best episodes, when the tension between Maddie and David was almost palpable.

I was very pleasantly surprised when I started this series.  My memories of Moonlighting are (for the most part) of the later seasons, which simply weren't as good.

One minor complaint.  Some of the episodes have the shorter opening and closing that was used when the show was in syndication.  The opening on the show, with the great Al Jereau theme sone, deserves to be seen and heard in its entirety.

Sadly, this captures the show at its best.  With a few exceptions, things went down from here.  Like Cheers before, it was the tension between Maddy and David that made things great.  Once they got together, it just wasn't the same show.",1126396800,8,1089,4.703703703703703

I wasn't sure if I still would love the show after all those years (I haven't seen it more then ten years) and all I can say, buying the DVD box was definitely the best investment I did in a long time. The show has lost nothing of it's congeniality. If I see a film or show I once loved several years later, I often ask myself, why oh why did I ever liked this. Not with Moonlighting, the show has lost nothing of it's magic, the dialogs are still great, the fast talking wit is still unbelievable well done, the bantering just blows me away and the chemistry between Cybill and Bruce ... let's put it this way, twenty years and uncountable TV shows later they are still the hottest TV couple.

The picture and sound look great, and the features are nice to have.

As someone else posted, i was disappointed that they were not able to use the William Tell overture for the chase in ""Lady in the Iron Mask""... the humor of the chase loses its timing, which goes to show how effective music is to any show.

Also, a minor point i noticed that not many would, was in the episode ""Funeral for a Door Nail"". When Maddie is reading the dirty magazine in the store, a phony bookcase is superimposed over the scene to block the magazine cover..it looked very obvious. i checked my vhs tape, and the women on the cover was fully dressed, so it seemed odd they felt they needed to edit this scene, and badly at it too.

Once I got past the disorienting time travel to the fashion/hair of the 80s, I fell in love all over again.  I feel like a teenager again.

2248102,5,B0007XBMA2,"I still have what I consider to be the best episodes of ""Moonlighting"" on tape (albeit, Beta tapes).  So when I watched the first two seasons of Glen Gordon Caron's seminal dramedy series that first aired in 1985 and saw the rest of the show I found myself wishing that we did some television shows the way they do in Great Britain.  A ""series"" across the pond is what we call a season here, and a show like ""Coupling,"" for example, might do only six episodes in a season.  Well, the first season of ""Moonlighting"" only had five episodes after the pilot movie, and like most series the other writers had problems getting a handle on the show's uniqueness.  Only ""The Next Murder You Hear,"" written by Peter Silverman, is on the same level as the pilot.  ""Moonlighting"" was pretty good, but it had its low points and imagine how great it would have been if these were the six episodes that made up the second season:

(8) ""Brother, Can You Spare a Blonde?"" (Written by Caron), in which David's brother Ritchie (Charles Rocket) stops by for a visit; (10) ""Money Talks, Maddie Walks"") (Written by Kerry Ehrin & Ali Marie Matheson), where Maddie finds out that the accountant who embezzled her fortune is running a casino down South American way; (11) ""The Dream Sequences Always Rings Twice"" (Written by Debra Frank & Carl Sautter) is the monochromatic episode, introduced by Orson Welles, where we get Maddie and David's different takes on an unsolved murder mystery from 1946; (15) ""Portrait of Maddie"" (Written by Ehrin & Matheson) in which a painting of Maddie is a clue to a stolen masterpiece and an episode which features the longest period of time without dialogue in the show's history; (21) ""Every Father's Daughter is a Virgin"" (Written by Bruce Franklin Singer) has Maddie's mother (Eva Marie Saint) and father (Robert Webber) paying a visit, and David finding out something about Maddie's father she does not want to know; and (22) ""Witness for the Execution"" (Written by Jeff Reno & Ron Osborn) surprises us by coming up with a reason for David and Maddie to finally kiss.

This is not to say that there are not other episodes in the running (e.g., ""My Fair David"" and ""In God We Strongly Suspect"") and if somebody wants to argue there should be eight episodes or even ten (add ""Atlas Belched"" and ""Funeral for a Door Nail"") I will not say thee nay.  But given the problems they had shooting their 140 pages scripts and getting new episodes on each week, I cannot help but think that the show would have been even greater if we they had not wasted precious time on less than stellar episodes, such as the painful ""Camille"" that wastes Whoopi Goldberg and Judd Nelson in a story that abuses the show's post modernistic tendency to break the fourth wall.

For my money ""M*A*S*H"" became the original television dramedy with its first season episode ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet.""  As a Detective Comedy/Drama ""Moonlighting"" is clearly a dramedy as well, but a large part of its uniqueness as a television series was because of it being decidedly postmodern.  There was the verbal self-reflexivity in which David and Maddie were clearly aware they were television characters, the musical self-reflexivity where ""Moonlighting"" employed an incongruous juxtaposition of the musical soundtrack and the action on screen (using ""The William Tell Overture"" for the chase scene at the end of ""The Lady in the Iron Mask"") or sometimes it fits (e.g., when David listens to ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"" while trailing Maddie's father), and the show's intertextuality as it plays with the boundaries of the Situation Comedy and the Detective genres.  Then there are all references to other texts such as films, songs, novels, etc., through episode titles (e.g., ""My Fair David,"" ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice""), dialogue, musical cues, and visual techniques.

Picking up all these references was what made watching ""Moonlighting"" fun as David and Maddie slowly but surely fought their verbal duels on their way to their inevitable kiss in the parking garage.  If there is a ""mistake"" to be found in some of the early episodes it is the idea that the detective part of the show was as important as the relationship between the two stars.  But coming up with an actual mystery for the Blue Moon Detective Agency to solve was not as important as the fact the case would gave David and Maddie something to fight about.  If she was not going to end up slamming a door over the case of the week, then the writers are missing the point.  But then the strangest thing about watching the ""Moonlighting"" pilot is being shocked at how slow the two stars are talking at that point.

The key thing is that when ""Moonlighting"" was good during those first two seasons it was great, and even when it is not so good, there are usually a couple of good one liners buried in it to be enjoyed.  Cybil Shepherd and Bruce Willis apparently ended up not being able to stand each other off camera, but their on screen chemistry is undeniable (I was pleasantly surprised Willis showed up to do an audio commentary track for ""My Fair David,"" not to mention his remembering the ""You de-Daved him"" line).  Therefore it is probably a good thing that they did not do the less is more approach.  Still, a ""Moonlighting"" that was written only by Glen Gordon Caron would have been something to watch (think a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" written only by Joss Whedon).

So when is Season 3 coming out?",1120521600,10,5469,4.734736842105264
2248103,4,B0007XBMA2,"Moonlighting was my favorite television show of the 1980's.  However, I did not realize how much I liked the show or how much I missed it until it came out on DVD and felt that I had to get it.  I was a little worried, though, about how aged it must seem.

 What caught me by surprise is how funny Bruce Willis is in the show.  His performance is even more amazing when you consider that he was completely unknown before coming onto the show because he immediately comes across as the star of the show.

Almost everything about the show is great: The title song by Al Jarreau, David Addison's unorthodox meathods of getting clients and solving cases, and of course the constant, highly-charged clashes between David and Maddie.

My only (slight) complaint is that the writing is rather weak until the last show of the first season. (To me it seems that the pilot, while hilarous, has a plot that is a blatant rip-off of ""The Marathon Man."") Also some of the dialogue dips dangerously close to banality at times (what am I saying? It was a TV show after all).

Overall, the shows strengths more than make up for the few kinks that had to be ironed out in the early shows.  I bought this DVD with a few concerns about whether it would still be any good.  After watching this first installment I will definitely buy the next one.",1120435200,5,1326,4.419753086419753

And of course, the sparks generated by the unbelievable chemistry between Cybill Shepherd & Bruce Willis. I can't wait for them to release the rest of the episodes.

The DVDs themselves are great, I especially enjoy the extra features, i.e. commentary from the cast & crew.  It would be awesome if they'd add the outtakes, deleted scenes, and such on the next DVD set.",1119916800,3,683,4.483870967741935
2248105,5,B0007XBMA2,For some reason this show hasn't been picked up by Nic @ Night or TV Land........Loved it when it was on and missed it ever since. Next month Remington Steele comes out. These two shows on DVD......now we're talkin',1119571200,3,215,4.538461538461538
2248106,5,B0007XBMA2,"I heard that the reason this TV series took so long to be released on DVD was because of the difficulty and expense of securing the rights to all the songs that Bruce Willis sings throughout the series. They could have rushed out a DVD where they edit out his little ditties (much like MTV did with ""The Real World New York"" on DVD), but I'm so glad they didn't. That was a major part of the appeal of the show for me. Bruce Willis singing got me to buy his two albums when I was a teenager. He was my idol at the time, as I wanted to be like David Addison...the coolest guy in the universe!

I haven't seen this show in 15 years, so it has been amazing to watch again after so much time has passed. Its like meeting again with an old friend. So many details that I had forgotten, yet some memorable scenes that are awesome to view again (I remembered most the ""Limbo Rock"" scene, the scene where ""This Old Heart of Mine"" plays when David reignites an old flame, and lines like, ""a coffin in a hearse--call Mike Wallace!"" or the Seusslike dialogue about a Chinese man with a mole on his nose). Relive all this and more! This collection represents the first two seasons, when the show was fresh, funny, clever, original, and the best thing on TV (before the battles between Cybill and Bruce became so disruptive that the show focused on secondary characters like Miss Dipesto and her boyfriend).

In watching these shows again, its easy to see what's great about it and what wasn't great about it. The battles between David Addison and Maddie Hayes were what made this show immensely watchable. The fast-talking wit and clever references to pop culture tidbits always kept the viewer alert and needing to watch again to catch everything. The only thing that doesn't hold up well were the cases. Many of them weren't that well thought out, though there were often twists upon twists. However, in terms of crime solving cases, this wasn't the show for a serious look at that. This show is all about Maddie and David, the tensions between them, their polar opposite personalities that ignited a firestorm between them. Once the show made them sleep together, it went downhill in a hurry. It ran for 5 seasons, but the first three are worth owning to watch again and again. Hope that they will release the other seasons on DVD soon...but until then, I'll continue to watch these classic episodes of my favorite show of all time.",1119398400,6,2423,4.517084282460137
2248107,5,B0007XBMA2,"The funny thing about this show is, since it ended in 1989 it never really hit it big in syndication, unlike other shows (Seinfeld , Cheers, Everybody loves Raymond etc...) I'm 35 now, and can honestly say that there were a few episodes that I hadn't seen since Junior year of high school. I agree with all the 5 Star reviews about how wonderful this show was, so I won't repeat the same positive comments.

  There is a part of me that wishes the show could have lasted just a few more years, but in hindsight it ended at the right time. When the show ended in May of 1989, Bruce Willis was already on his way to becoming a movie star.  He hit it big with the first ""Die Hard"" in the summer of 1988. It would have been almost impossible to go on location to make movies and still find time to do a TV show.

  I'm kind of partial to Season 3, (I can't wait for it to be released). It seems all my favorite episodes are from that season.",1119398400,5,937,4.087431693989071
2248108,5,B0007XBMA2,"I watched these shows in the 80s and loved them then, and they are still funny and fresh 20 years later.  I agree with those that say the pilot is the weakest of these shows; the writers continued to improve as time went on and the line delivery of the actors improved as well.  It's almost funny the way they light Cybill Shepherd!  It's not as if she was ancient; after all she was only 35 when the show started.  But I digress.  I also agree that it's unforutnate that they replaced the ""William Tell Overture"" (aka ""the Lone Ranger"") in the ""Lady in the Iron Veil"" eppy. The piece of music was okay for a chase scene, but it lacked the comedic element.  (**found out via an online source that this was simply an error made at the studio; they used the clip with the ""mockup"" music by mistake.  I hope someday they'll release a new DVD set with the correct music). However.  The show is still funny, Bruce is still extremely charming, and IMO, makes the show.  It's so hard to believe that the idgits at ABC didn't want him!  Cybill did a great job...at the time, no one knew she could do comedy.  Wonderful show, regardless of the few little flaws of the DVD set. I am happy to own the entire set, even though it didn't really have that great an ending.",1119312000,2,1257,4.283898305084746
2248119,5,B0007XBMA2,"Okay, so I was totally OBSESSED with 'Moonlighting' from when I first started watching it at 15 years old. I videotaped nearly every episode at the time because I knew even then that they would certainly be worth watching again and again due to the intense could-cut-the-sexual-tension-with-a-knife onscreen chemistry of Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis, the classic comic moments, clever plots and storylines along with the wide variety of music that drove them, and OF COURSE... that fast, witty dialogue with all its sharp innuendo, imbedded (and not-so-imbedded) jokes, honesty, intelligence, and utter silliness. So, after much campaigning and petition-signing by rabid 'Moonlighting' fans like me (Until recently, I had had NO IDEA that such an avid internet community for this show existed out there!), including the addition of my own signature/comment to the infamous online DVD campaign petition, we have been rewarded with a gorgeous DVD box set of the first two seasons + pilot of this seminal show. I guess that tenacity pays off!

Now, about the DVD set itself...

First of all, I think it was a smart move by Lion's Gate to only release the first two seasons at this point in order to gage buyer response. Hopefully, if this DVD set's sales go well, we will be rewarded yet again with the rest of the series' run on DVD. I know this feels like this should be a given for most fans. However, it might be better not to take this kind of stuff for granted. Lion's Gate needs to make money, plus, honestly... and I hate to say this as a devoted fan... the first two seasons were OVERALL a better product than the last three seasons anyway, with things really starting to go south somewhere in the middle of Season 4. So, I'm pleased that we at least get almost half--the BEST half--of the series' total episodes NOW.

Lion's Gate did an absolutely awesome job with the packaging. It elicited no less than a gasp of delight from me when I opened mine (pre-ordered via Amazon). It's not your typical cheesey TV show DVD case. It looks like the graphic designers really put some thought into this particular piece. It's a thing of true beauty with the die-cut silhouette of David and Maddie on the front cover against the clear plastic window cut out to cleverly show the moon in the background that's actually screen-printed on the first DVD of the six total in the package. The other five DVD's themselves are also ""moons"" but are also printed with great photo images of the cast members--Cybill, Bruce, and Allyce Beasley (the ditzy Blue Moon receptionist ""Agnes Dipesto"").

The episodes themselves are absolutely stunning. It's so satisfying to see them in crisp, full color... obviously much better than they ever looked via the original TV broadcast on ABC (my parents didn't have cable TV until about a year into the series so my VHS recordings of the first two seasons are totally grainy from horrid antenna reception... yikes!) and of course, not chopped up with commercial breaks as they were on ABC or in syndication. Plus, the better sound quality allows me to catch snippets of conversation, etc. that I wasn't able to before. The episodes are now as they were truly meant to be seen... as mini movie masterpieces. Even the soft-filtered shots of Cybill Shepherd (for the sake of disguising her age--although she really didn't need it!) aren't distracting but rather beautiful and magical. She and Bruce Willis looked so good together in all their 80's glory; big hair, big shoulder pads, big Ray Ban sunglasses, and all! She was so gorgeously blonde and he was soooo cute back in the day. I love how within the episodes' commentaries, the show's creator (Glenn Gordon Caron), directors, producer, and writers collectively and repeatedly remark in these awe-inspired tones on how beautiful she looks. I also enjoyed how often Cybill gushes about how cute Bruce was (and is!) during her commentary along with Mr. Caron on the ""Every Daughter's Father is a Virgin"" episode.

Speaking of the commentaries by the actors and behind-the-scenes folks... they are indeed wonderful and reveal some great human aspects of the show. I just wish there were MORE of them! In fact, if I was to do a separate rating on the DVD's extras themselves, I would give them 4 stars instead of 5. It would have been fantastic if they could have had Bruce and Cybill commenting TOGETHER on at least one of the many episodes. I hear that Bruce and Cybill are on better terms since Anchor Bay's pilot episode DVD release in '03 (where apparently Glenn and Bruce did a commentary with some anti-Cybill sentiments contained within) so why wasn't it do-able for THIS release??? Also, just where the heck are the ""Deleted Scenes"" and ""Gag Reel/Bloopers"" per Amazon's product description?!? Are these hidden via a DVD ""Easter Egg"" format??? Because if they're there, I sure haven't found them yet. If anyone knows, please post as such because I'm totally puzzled. Oh well! I'm not complaining too much though. The DVD's three featurettes--""The Story of Moonlighting - Parts 1 & 2"" and ""The Moonlighting Phenomenon""--make up for these missing(?) elements.

This DVD set is a MUST HAVE for any 'Moonlighting' fan but also a lovely treat for anyone who didn't have the pleasure of experiencing it in its 80's heyday. The fun romance of Dave and Maddie makes this nostalgic journey quite delicious!",1118793600,11,5383,4.864776444929117
2248120,5,B0007XBMA2,"In a landscape dominated by Dynasty and Hill St. Blues, Moonlighting was a breath of fresh air when it debuted on American television in 1985. It was a detective show that provided a funny, witty alternative and ambitiously took the screwball comedy popular in the `30s and `40s and gave it a contemporary spin that has never been duplicated as successfully on mainstream TV since.

The first two seasons feature Moonlighting in its purest form: sharp and focused. What makes the show work so well is the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. They banter and bicker furiously like a couple straight out of a Howard Hawks screwball comedy. Their exchanges are delivered fast with dialogue often overlapping that is very funny.

The writing on the show is very good. The dialogue is crisp with a snap and pop to it. In ""Next Stop Murder,"" an homage to Agatha Christie murder mysteries, Blue Moon's chipper, rhyming receptionist, Miss DiPesto (Beasley) wins a contest to participate in famous mystery writer J.B. Harland's murder mystery train. David and Maddie drive her to the station and accidentally get stranded on the train with a real murder to solve. Here is a memorable exchange in the episode:

Maddie: ""I was not born yesterday!""

David: ""It's true. I had lunch with her yesterday. If she'd been born I'd a noticed.""

It isn't only the words but how Willis delivers them that makes what he says so funny. And yet, the show isn't wall-to-wall comedy. There are sober moments of drama and, of course, romance. The show even addresses David's lack of maturity in ""My Fair David,"" where Maddie bets him that he can't act like a mature professional for a full week. This episode features some of the funniest bits between Shepherd and Willis in the show's entire run.

This excellent 6-DVD set features top notch transfers and a nice collection of extras, featuring the participation of the three regulars (Willis, Shepherd and Beasley), for fans to enjoy.

The first DVD features an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" by writer/creator Glenn Gordon Caron, director Robert Butler, editor Artie Mandelberg and producer Jay Daniel. Completists and fans that have the Anchor Bay DVD should hold onto it as there is a different commentary with Caron and Willis.

""Not Just A Day Job - The Story of Moonlight Part 1"" takes a look at the first season. ""Moonlighting Pilot Promo"" features a collection of vintage TV ads for the first episode of the show.

The third DVD includes an audio commentary on ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice"" by director Peter Werner, co-writer Debra Frank and Caron. The met a lot of resistance from the network who didn't want them to shoot in black and white with ambitious musical numbers.

There is also a commentary for ""My Fair David"" with director Will Mackenzie and Bruce Willis. They point out the continuity goofs on Willis' tie and tend to spend more time watching the episode then commenting on it.

The fifth DVD features an audio commentary on ""Twas the Episode Before Christmas"" by director Werner, Daniel and Allyce Beasley. Daniel provides a wealth of production information and trivia.

Also included is an audio commentary on ""Every Daughter's Father is a Virgin"" by Cybill Shepherd and Caron. They talk about how an episode is put together while the actress is refreshingly

candid about the times when she lost her cool.

The sixth DVD features ""The Story of Moonlighting Part 2"" which focuses on the second season. Caron used the show's success to spend additional money on more ambitious episodes. However, they didn't always meet their scheduled air dates with scenes being written on the spot.

""The Moonlighting Phenomenon"" has fans, critics and crew members gush about the show and talk about its significance. It was created during the conservative `80s and how it started off with mediocre ratings (it was one of many detective shows on at the time) but over the summer it was rediscovered via reruns and took off.",1118707200,17,3984,4.898959881129272
2248121,2,B0007XBMA2,"I watched Moonlighting when it first aired but i didn't remember a single episode except for the black-and-white one, and that's mainly because it was so over-hyped at the time. Generally the show is over-written and performed, and it never stops smirking.",1118707200,5,256,5.119047619047619
2248122,5,B0007XBMA2,"Although I was too young to remember Moonlighting from it's original run on TV in the 1980s, I became a big fan of the show after catching reruns on the Paramount Comedy Channel here in the UK. I've never really been a fan of detective TV shows because they all seem the same to me, but Moonlighting had something special that grabbed my attention. It was fresh, spunky, witty, clever and ORIGINAL. It was unlike any other show of it's genre that I'd seen before, hooking me in instantly with it's class, charm and intelligence and wonderful sense of fun. Since there were no DVDs of ML back then, I had to make do with buying the few official VHS tapes that had been released, and evnetually got desperate enough to buy my favourite episodes from traders online when the Paramount Commedy Channel stopped airing the show. I always hoped that DVDs would come along, and waited, and waited. Now they're here, in my possession having just arrived this morning, I can safely say that the waiting was worth it and the DVD boxset is better than I could've hoped for.

The box itself is GORGEOUS (the pics online do NOT do it justice, trust me), with exceptional cover art that far exceeds most DVDs. Usually DVD boxart is crude and uninspiring but ML's packaging reeks of quality, thought, effort and care to the point where it looks very pretty on my shelf. Inside, there are six discs that are very easily accessable - too often I have a battle removing DVDs from their packaging when I go to watch them but not here thankfully.

All the episodes from seasons one and two are here, including the two hour Pilot movie, which is a treat because more often than not, pilot movies aren't included in boxsets. This is very complete, and the picture quality is superb, as is the sound.

The special features are amazing and a real treat for any ML ""die hards"" like me. We get a two part documentary, ""Inside Blue Moon Detective Agency: The Story Of Moonlighting"", another documentary called ""The Moonlighting Phenomenon"", and audio commentary on four episodes (The Pilot, The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice, My Fair David and 'Twas The Night Before Christmas) by cast and crew. There is no possible way this boxset could be any better than it is, it's the most perfect, complete set I've seen and I am so thrilled to own it.

If you like ML at all, I beg you to buy this DVD because the more this one sells, the more likely we will see future seasons released. ML is too good to suffer the fate of most TV shows and only release a couple of seasons - EVERY episode of ML deserves to be on DVD. This set is WELL worth the money, I can't recommend it enough!",1118707200,9,2650,4.480331262939958
2248123,5,B0007XBMA2,"Watch the pilot of Moonlighting with the knowledge that it is by far the weakest part of this terrific show - as pilots often are.  (The bad guys practically twirled invisible mustaches trying to look their baddest.)  Establishing the main characters was the prime function of the pilot and it works well on that level.  All the other shows are much better.  Moonlighting is focused on Maddy and David, their rapid-fire banter, David's ultra-hippness, Maddy's flashing comic anger and how very pretty they both were.

Do not watch this DVD for plot or for mystery, although the opening scenes of all shows were excellent - classy and often a colorful hat tip to film noir (can there be such a thing).  It is not hard to figure out who dunnit - but I doubt many would bother as the enjoyment of the show is watching the 2 main characters talk to each other.  There is always one scene in a moving car as well as scenes in the office during which the characters verbally parry and thrust. Additionally, there are physical comedy and sight gags that work as well as the verbal quips.

Do not miss Bruce at his bruciest and Cybil becoming a first class comic actress.  Together they were very special indeed.

I most highly recommend this series.",1118188800,11,1242,4.6045454545454545

2248125,5,B0007XBMA2,"First of all I would like to commend Amazon.com for getting my order to me in two days even using the free super saver shipping, beating their estimate by a week.  I've been waiting for this release for a long time!  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I did not have this on tape nor do I have cable so it has been many moons (no pun intended?) since I last saw any episodes except the pilot.  I've watched the first three episodes so far and I am happy I bought the set!  I won't repeat the episode details since so many others have done that except to say that Bruce and Cybil were perfect casting.

As for the DVD's, the picture quality is very good.  One reviewer commented that the sound level was low and after watching three episodes, I've found that the level on the first two is higher than on the third one.  It isn't muffled, just lower so turning up the volume is an easy fix.  Also, thank you to Lion's Gate for (1) giving this volume a decent price, unlike the greed that is associated with the release of Northern Exposure's seasons; (2) using single-sided discs with classy labeling; (3) having a nice package for the DVD's; and very importantly, (4) not bombarding us with ads and other unnecessary garbage that we are forced to watch or else flip through at the beginning of the discs!  Instead it goes right to the menu, which is what all of us want.  Nice job!  Moonlighting was a wonderful series and Lions Gate did the DVD's right.  I can't comment about the missing or substituted music clips since that may have been beyond their control.",1118016000,19,1563,4.407665505226481
2248126,5,B0007XBMA2,"I am a big fan of Moonlighting and was greatly disappointed when the reruns were no longer showing in the US as I didn't save the tapes I had from the early 1990 reruns.  I am thrilled that Moonlighting is now on DVD and will buy it anyway it comes.  My only hope is that they release the rest of the seasons in the near future as well.  I look forward to seeing the ""Taming of a Shrew"" episode as well as ""Man on Mulberry Street"" episode which are two of my favorites, but again, I'm just happy to have the first half for now.",1117929600,6,527,4.0
2248127,4,B0007XBMA2,"I am going to cut and paste a quote from Sharon, another reviewer whose review appears below, because she perfectly sums up my feelings on a particular issue...  My own comments will follow.

""'Lady in the Iron Mask' had one of the classic chase scenes of all time. Originally during that scene, the music being played is ""The William Tell Overture"" ( otherwise known as the Hopalong Cassidy theme ). Perfectly timed, the scene was hilarious. They had some other music playing and I know it sounds stupid, but it wasn't as funny.""

Now I remember reading several places that this box set wasn't released a few years ago because it seemed like it was going to be nearly impossible to get all the music rights/clearances and the show's creator wouldn't allow it to be released without the original music.  Well, to expand on what Sharon stated above, the ""Lady in the Iron Mask"" chase scene was, in my opinion, ""Moonlighting""'s funniest moment.  I find it interesting they could get the rights to the Pet Shop Boys, the Rolling Stones,  and all the classic Motown tracks, but NOT to ""The William Tell Overture""?  Then again, ""The Price is Right"" stopped using ""William Tell..."" in one of its games (The Race Game) some years back too.  Maybe Mr. Tell's publishing rights cost too much?  If anyone knows the reason why it was changed, PLEASE post it here.  I don't mean to sound ungrateful, it's just that one of my favorite television moments ever was totally ruined by the deletion of that piece of music.  I only hope when they release future seasons, the great usage of Janet Jackson's ""Nasty"" and the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" aren't altered.  Music was, as you can tell, an INTEGRAL part of ""Moonlighting"".  Fortunately, the music was intact for the shows' second funniest chase scene, which is in ""Camille"", starring Whoopi Goldberg.  That is by far my favroite episode in this set!  The juxtaposition between Camille being chased and the assassination attempt is just visually and audially(sp?) stunning.

Now onto the rest of it...  Great, great great!!!  The packaging, start menu, etc. are just wonderful.  There's no scene selection feature, but I don't miss it at all.  The featurettes are done greatly as well.  The episodes with commentary are not listed in the episode description booklet that comes inside, but that is only a minor annoyance.  I haven't listened to any of the commentary yet, but seeing that Bruce, Cybill, and Glenn Caron all participated, it should not disappoint...  ENJOY!!!",1117929600,11,2506,4.8584905660377355
2248128,4,B0007XBMA2,"Watching the black and white episode (when David and Maddie have separate dreams about a crime that took place back in the 1940's) brought back a lot of memories for me.  How great the writing was on this show.  How much I thought David was the coolest character on TV.  And lastly, how great the two character's chemistry was.  The 6 disc set will bring back lots of memories for those of you who loved the show and will be refreshing to those that only know the post Die Hard (or even post Pulp Fiction) Bruce Willis.  Must buy if you enjoy 80's TV shows.  Now if only Family Ties could be out on DVD....
Last note, would have liked 1 or 2 more extras to be included in the set (perhaps they are being saved for future DVD releases).  Also, would have liked to have seen Cybil and Bruce be in the same room at the same time when they were being interviewed to see if they still HATE each other.  :)",1117843200,6,900,4.161849710982659

The commentaries are wonderful for repeat viewing, and believe tha Doctah when she tells you, you WILL watch these episodes several times. The humor has more layers than an onion. It simply never gets dull or stale. I've waited twenty years for a product like this and I am utterly pleased.

The is no William Tell overature in the climatic chase scene.  And quite frankly, it sucks now as it has lost a portion of the humor.  I also believe that the music is different in another episode, and the bloopers of the Dr. Suess-ish rhyme is not at the end of the episode, ""The Murder is in the Mail.""

2248141,5,B0007XBMA2,"My wife bought me ""Moonlighting,"" my personal favorite TV series of all time, as an early Father's Day present!  I'm really enjoying the great verbal interplay between the leads -- it's very reminiscent of the wonderful screwball comedies of Preston Sturges and Howard Hawkes.

The first season is the most 'plot driven' of the series.  By season two, the great dialogue, romance and office nonsense had become predominant, which in the case of Moonlighting, was all to the better!

Truly, this wonderful show was only nominally a 'detective' story and used the detective plots for sight gags and madcap moments.  Also, I had forgotten how good a singer Bruce Willis was; not in a professional way, but in off-the-wall singing!

I had taped these off the original ABC airings and so far have not noticed any cuts.  I haven't cued them up because my tapes of the first 3 seasons were destroyed in a house fire...  Thus, getting these replacement DVDs of the first 2 seasons was a godsend.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves great dialogue and verbal banter.  The chemistry between the leads belies Cybill's comments that they never 'slept together.'  There's a lot of 'tension' between the two leads which gives the romantic tension believability and, of course, the off-stage tension between the two was tabloid fodder for years.

Buying this series is like buying 24 movies and, thus, one hell-of-a bargain!  TVonDVD just doesn't get much better!",1117756800,5,1462,4.942622950819672

Bruce Willis is just perfect as David Addison and he and Cybill (no matter what was going on behind the scenes) are perfection together. I remember waiting and waiting for them to just kiss already! The dialog just doesn't get any better than this either. Watching 15 min of this show is like digesting 60 minutes of standard fare. The give and take and the screw-ball antics are done to perfect timing. Agnes DePesto as the secretary is a treasure; no other side-kick like this gal! I can't recommend this DVD set enough.

Needless to say, I was disappointed. When I started playing the DVD, no closed captions are shown. I wouldnt have bought the DVD set if I knew closed-captions weren't included. I don't understand why the creators of the set labeled it as CC enabled. Unless there is a different area of the DVD needed to go to to put the captions on, but I sure can't find it. If there is anybody there who can help me with this situation, I would appreciate it. [...]. Thanks in advance to anyone who can solve this problem for me.",1117670400,4,783,4.157894736842105
2248145,5,B0007XBMA2,"This was a great TV show, but admittedly, when I watched it in the 1980s, I didn't get some of the jokes. My favorite episode was ""The Lady in the Iron Mask,"" and I was in sixth grade when I first saw it. Now the show is even better to me--I am really enjoying this DVD set. The background music gives the show a ""movie quality,"" as the score is reminiscent of classic Hollywood film scores. The writing is superb, and the timing of the actors' lines is just right. For younger people who did not see the show when it was being aired, I think you will find it entertaining today, and you can get an idea of how far television (for the most part) has declined since then.

There have already been some great and insightful reviews of this product, so I will not reiterate the details about DVD extras. One thing that I have not seen mentioned in the reviews so far is that this DVD set is a great value in terms of packaging. When ""Sex and the City"" released the abbreviated 5th season, there were tons of complaints from fans about the high price of the DVD set, with just a few episodes. The packaging of ""Moonlighting,"" however, includes both the first season (which is basically a half-season) AND the second season for one great price.",1117584000,4,1239,4.363636363636363
2248146,5,B0007XBMA2,"When Bruce Willis' appeared on ""Moonlighting"" he was an unknown actor who had done a ""Twilight Zone"" and a variety of miscellaneous guest appearances. You knew from his first scene he was going to be a big star. He had charisma. Former model Maddie Hayes (Cybil Shepherd) wakes up one morning to discover her accountants have ripped her off. She's broke. All she has left are the businesses she invested in. Her lawyer advises her to visit each one, sell it or close it down to liquidate the assets and become solvent again. When she visits the City of Angels Detective Agency (later the Blue Moon Detective Agency) she tries to do the same thing. Only David Addison (Bruce Willis) the manager of the agency has other plans in mind. He woos Maddie convincing her to not only keep the agency open but gets her involved in their latest case and wets her appetite for the biz and man does she get a buzz out of it.

Featuring top notch writing, direction and performances ""Moonlighting"" became a surprise hit for ABC. Unfortunately, by the 3rd season Willis and Shepherd were butting heads and the show had run into a creative dead end so ""Moonlighting"" became a hit series that experienced a brief, bright creative life and then faded away. Luckily, syndication kept the show alive for fans. Willis has gone on to bigger things and Shepherd has revived her several times since then but nothing could quite capture the magic of the original pairing and the first two marvelous seasons of the series.

 Lion's Gate has done an extensive restoration on ""Moonlighting"". The series looks and sounds better than most series from the early 80's. There's occasional analog defects in the form of dirt and noticeable grain in some episodes but, on the whole, the show looks sharp with vivid colors and images. Interestingly, some of the episodes here run a bit short which leads me to suspect that the syndicated versions were used for the set although I haven't seen the series in so long I don't know which ones they may have used. If that's the case, I would guess that it was inadvertent and they also probably went with whatever prints were available on the release time table they had for the series. The audio is also quite good and, although the box states it's stereo, I don't recall the series being broadcast that way. My guess is that stereo masters were prepared and then mixed down to mono for the original broadcast episodes. The dialog is occasionally muffled and flat sounding and the volume is also quite low for most of these episodes.

We get three exceptional featurettes all of which have the participation of the original cast and/or crew of the series. ""Not Just a Day Job"" focuses on the creation of the show and the first season. There's interviews with Cybill Shepherd, creator/writer/producer Glenn Gordon Caron, director Robert Butler (who shot the pilot episode and, curiously shot many of the pilots for some of the most memorable shows from the 60's, 70's and 80's including ""Star Trek""), Bruce Willis, Allyce Beasley and the staff writers for the first season. It's quite a comprehensive look at what made the show so successful. ""Not Just a Day Job"" appears on the first disc of the set.

""The Moonlighting Phenomenon focuses on the success of the show and its afterlife in syndication. A variety of folks from members of the Moonlighting Fan Club to creator Caron discussing why the show remains popular and has continued to resonate with fans. Caron discusses how he felt it was time to take the air out of detective shows which were ubiquitous on the networks during the 80's. Cybill Shepherd talks about the way that the show constantly broke down the TV ""4th wall"" cluing in the audience on the action and humor of the series pointing out that only certain characters (such as David Addison) could do it.  Willis is pretty quiet throughout the interview but does make a couple of pointed comments about the chemistry of the show. Allyce Beasley points out that the work load was on Shepard and Willis the most since the network saw them as the focus of the show. The resulting pressure created conflicts between the two stars but also created additional ""magic"" on the screen. Like Lennon & McCartney the two of them were perfect from the first moment together on screen.

""Inside Blue Moon Detective Agency""  has Caron pointing out that the network was making a huge profit on the series and how he pushed to have money ploughed back into the series. He also resented doing 22 episodes a year and the pressure of doing the series like any other TV show. Caron's issue was that the show cost more than other TV series. The network's issue was the fact that the show didn't always make its airdate. They literally would finish some episodes  before the show was scheduled to air. Shepherd felt that the series was so dense that it was like shooting a movie on a TV schedule. The inside joke was that they would make it up in their shots driving the car. By the way, you can spot the fact that they were rarely ""driving"" during these scenes but the chemistry and magic was there so they kept it. We also discover how Caron ended up having Orson Welles introduce the infamous black and white episode. Sadly, Welles died one week after the episode was shot. It would have been a blast to have him direct or write one episode of the series even though he was at the end of his career.

Commentary tracks are tricky to do effectively. Luckily, we get five here that are memorable and very well done. The pilot features Caron, pilot director Butler, producer Daniels, editor Mandelberg throwing out trivia throughout the entire 45 minute episode. ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice"" featuring Peter Werner, Debra Frank (co-writer of the episode) and Glenn Gordon Caron also ranks pretty highly up there. Still, for my money the best of the commentary tracks are those by Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis on ""Every Daughter is a Virgin"" and ""My Fair David"" respectively. The two reveal quite a bit about the day-to-day production of the series but also some their issues during production as well.

A great 80's show that has aged very, very well, ""Moonlighting"" still has the magic. Lion's Gate has done a terrific job putting together this set. I'm happy to report they went to great lengths to restore the episodes here.  The extras are great here as are most of the commentary tracks. I didn't find the packaging as much of an issue as one reviewer and felt it was good overall (particularly when compared to many other boxed sets where the discs are released as dual sided and face each other in the set insuring they'll get scratched).",1117497600,17,6665,4.692044482463644
2248147,4,B0007XBMA2,"I was and still am a huge Moonlighting fan and it is because I loved the show so much that I noticed something in one of my favorite episodes that ruined the scene. ""Lady in the Iron Mask"" had one of the classic chase scenes of all time. Originally during that scene, the music being played is ""The William Tell Overture"" ( otherwise known as the Hopalong Cassidy theme ). Perfectly timed, the scene was hilarious. They had some other music playing and I know it sounds stupid, but it wasn't as funny. I watched the episode I had taped on VHS and what a difference. I cannot understand why they felt the need to tamper with perfection.

The rest of the DVD is good. I didn't care for the disc holders, they are kind of cheap looking, and the discs are not clearly marked. You need a magnifying glass to read them. The extras are great and of course the episodes are wonderful. I will forgive them there errors, the show is as funny as ever. It has definitely stood the test of time.",1117497600,12,982,4.308108108108108
2248148,5,B0007XBMA2,"Moonlighting was one of the most clever and stylish shows on television. I am so thrilled that it is finally available on DVD. The chemistry between Cybill Shephard and Bruce Willis is unmatched, which is odd considering the rumors that befell them regarding their apparent strife behind the scenes. This discord is not apparent watching the episodes, in which their chemistry is phenomenol.

The physical comedy in Moonlighting simply doesn't exisit in today's television programs. The writing is quite humorous and the supporting cast is genuinely talented. Even the storylines surrounding the supporting cast members are enjoyable.

All in all, a fantastic show and a welcome addition to my DVD collection.",1116979200,6,709,5.378378378378378
2248159,5,B0007XBMA2,"There were 5 seasons of Moonlighting, and there were a few ""glitches"" during that time (namely, the one where some goofus thought it would be ""interesting"" to have Maddie marry a less-than-sexy guy), but oh, the good times were twice as good, by comparison.  I have been writing TPTB regularly, seeing the other TV shows that have already made it to DVD, and I fully expect to buy each and every one as they're released.  (I've never forgotten the film noir story, or their take-off of Taming of the Shrew, and I can't wait to see it all again.) Thank you, to whoever finally made the right decision.  I can't wait for the end of this month!!!  (Bruce Willis, with a full head of hair......hubba, hubba, hubba!)",1116979200,5,711,4.574803149606299

I watched Moonlighting when it was on (probably part of the reason my grades in highschool weren't so hot) and I have all the episodes on Beta tape. I can't find anyone to fix my Beta player and I've been without Moonlighting for way too long.  This show started my almost 20 year love of Bruce Willis (and I'm only 32!).

Moonlighting was and always will be one of the most clever and well written romantic comedies on tv.  I've never seen anything come close and have missed it desperately.

2248164,5,B0007XBMA2,"I remember being so miffed when ""Moonlighting"" came out because it kind of spelled the beginning of the end for ""Remington Steele.""  I read Pierce Brosnan once said that this show was what ""Remington"" was supposed to be, probably because Glenn Gordon Caron, who also created the short-lived ""Now and Again,""

was a writer-producer on ""Remington"" the first season.

But as I watched this show, which I wanted to hate, I really loved it.  David and Maddie Hayes had great chemistry, the writing was great (introducing the snappy, fast-paced dialogue that a show like ""Gilmore Girls"" has on it), etc.  I could go on and on, but the main thing for me about the show was that it was - FUN!!  In fact, probably the last really well-done, not-taking-things seriously detective show on TV.  I haven't seen anything since, and in fact, would love to see a show more like it and ""Remington"" on TV.

Alas, much like ""Remington,"" this show fell into the trap of what happens once the two leads consummate their sexual lust and get together - your show goes in the dumper.  That, along with Caron's writing style of delivering script pages at the last minute, cast bickering, etc. ended what was a really fun and funny show.  I will be adding it to my collection, and you should, too, just as a reminder of what escapist TV can be all about. We're so caught up in making things realistic on shows now that producers have forgotten that people deal with reality in their everyday lives.  Like so many viewers, I wanna watch a show because the characters are likeable, worth watching, and the plots don't take themselves so seriously.  Maybe we'll get back to that someday, but, alas, not today.",1115251200,10,1680,4.657627118644068
2248165,5,B0007XBMA2,"I am so excited over the prospects of getting the first 2 seasons of Moonlighting on DVD. I set aside Tuesday nights every week to tape and watch the show. I didn't miss one episode. Like many, this was my first exposure to Bruce Willis. Since then I have been a ""Die Hard"" fan. And as far as Cybill Shephard goes, I have been a fan of hers forever. The combination of the music, the plots, and especially the bantering between Maddie and David made this show a must see. One of my favaorite David Addison expression is ""You can lead a horse to water, but it doesn't make him a duck"". My children got tired of hearing me say that, but you would be surprised how many situations it fits.

2248166,5,B0007XBMA2,"Moonlighting came in 1985 and had a great impact in all the fiction written for television since then. Why? Well.. let's see...

It all started as the basic detective formula: two incompatible oddballs brought together having to solve one case in each episode - basically the same premisse present in most of the shows until then.

But there is more than meets the eye.

Moonlighting introduced new values such as MUSIC.... no other show had such a dramatic use of music as Moonlighting. Here, the usual ""chase music"" present in all shows were changed for Motown, blues, old rock classics and other kinds of music that where always used to a dramatic effect. The choice of each song we hear throughout the seasons was cleverly made... It means that most of the shows that came after... from CHINA BEACH to SEX AND THE CITY to SIX FEET UNDER owes a lot to the way Moonlighting started to use music. I just feel sorry that the producers never released a bigger soundtrack on cd because the CD that came in 1987 was far from its potential....

More...

Moonlighting opened up the TV narrative to the inner mind of the characters... in the sence that from then on, everything was possible in terms of what's going on inside the characters and the way we see it on the screen. The usual voiceover narration (that's as far as TV shows went until Moonlighting) was replaced by dreams, animation, musical numbers, richer editing, etc... again, Moonlighting opened the path to the great TV fiction we see today. THE SOPRANOS owe a lot to that.

More...

No other TV show relied upon the viewer's bond to the characters as Moonlighting... you can see that by the incredible number of ways fiction and reality merged during many episodes... many times, David Addison adressed the audience directly. Many times the characters show the sets and the fact that they are in a TV show... something that 99% of the TV shows at that time could not do. It is true that Moonlighting was not the only show to do that. SLEDGE HAMMER, many times did the same... but Moonlighting wasn't only a comedy...

...It was perhaps one of the first TV shows to blend different genres that were usually kept separated. Was it comedy? Was it detective-genre like MAGNUM P.I.? Was it romance? It was certainly not fantasy... but there was a lot of fantasy in it.

...It was one of the first TV ""self-aware"" shows that even paid homages to Cinema (Film noir, great musicals, keystone cops... just to name a few).

It was also one of the first TV shows that actually had great supporting roles with plots and conflicts on their own.

Moonlighting brought also more mature themes and an increasingly complexness to the leading character's motivations. And in this sence it is fascinating to see that in Moonlighting we have a detective show where many episodes go by where Maddie and David do not have cases to solve... where the spotlight is in their relationship.

It is like the show started as a formula and drifted to something richer, more complex, newer...

TODAY, fiction is miles beyond Moonlighting... but the show remains fascinating as an example of a TV product where everything is right. I trully believe Moonlighting had an important role in the development of TV fiction into what we see today.

By the way... this DVD edition has been long anticipated by many fans like myself... It seems that it took a long time to secure the rights to all the great songs in the episodes... but now that everything is in order... let's enjoy the perfect chemistry between Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis... the last heirs of Katherine Hapburn and Cary Grant...

Simply great!!!!!!!!!",1111968000,132,3647,4.730283911671925
2248167,5,B0007XBMA2,"These DVD's have been long anticipated. As the webmaster of the popular Moonlighting site, [...] I think I can speak for the entire fan community when I say, ""These babies are way overdue!""

""Moonlighting"" was a smart, sassy and very popular series in the mid to late 80's. Maddie Hayes and David Addison were the ""hot"" couple on TV back then. When this show first aired, it created such a buzz not only for its innovative scripts and the creative risks it took--but for the phenomenal casting of Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis in these roles.  They were all the rage in 1986 & 1987 and no one that lived through the 80's could possibly have gotten through the time without knowing who they were.

The fans of the series have been loyal and new fans have been born out of more recent airings on cable channels both here in the US and overseas.  Their persistance and work have paid off with the release of these DVD's.

Season One has in addition to the Pilot, 5 episodes that deal with Maddie and David trying to survive with few or no clients.  And the ones they do have are usually not what they seem to be on surface.  There are some really funny scenes as the two banter and investigate.  The well-known ""Looking for a man with a Mole on his nose scene"" is in a season one episode.

Season two delivers 18 great episodes as the pair get to know each other better and better, the most famous one being the black and white episode ""The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice.""  Other notable episodes include a very funny Christmas episode complete with Mary, Joseph, Three Kings and a camel; the episode with the wacky chase scene with Maddie, David, a client, and her husband all dressed in identical black dresses with a veil as they race after each other to the tune of the William Tell Overture;  the Buenos Aires trip with Maddie and David at a casino, the hilarious ""My Fair David"" which features a contest to see if David can act like a mature adult; as well as the episode with the first real kiss shared between the duo.

The music in the episodes is also a notable part.  There are Motown classics, pop tunes, as well as Big Band era tunes sung by Cybill Shepherd ala Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda"".

Some of the exciting guest stars in seasons one and two included Dana Delany, Tim Robbins, Orson Welles, Barbara Bain, Mark Linn-Baker, Whoopi Goldberg and Judd Nelson. You also get to meet David's goofy brother aptly played by SNL alum Charles Rocket and Maddie's parents, the wonderful Eva Marie Saint and the late Robert Webber.

So don't delay in ordering these; TV this good only comes around once in a Blue Moon.

Added to on April 3, 2005.  I just noticed that so far  the Amazon.com listing doesn't mention the extras  that have  been announced for this release.  So I will list them here  for those  that want to know.

The list has been announced  to include:

Cast and Crew commentaries including Glenn Gordon Caron, Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis;
Not Just A Day Job - The Story of Moonlighting;
The Moonlighting Phenomenon;
Deleted Scenes;
Gag Reel

This sounds like a nice mix of fun and informative extras.
