8578751,5,B00C8EVNXE,I don't think that there is a kids show performer that wouldn't benefit from the material on this DVD. The two huge things that I got from viewing it is Ken's seamless use music/sound effects via the MP 3 Tech. The other big thing that I got from this is the amazing power of using puppets in your show.,1447372800,,303,4.1525423728813555
