I have watched the video and for the most part the information is accurate, fair, and most importantly unbiased.  I think A & E did and exceptional job at documenting the infamous Hatifelds and McCoys.  For more information on the Hatfields and McCoys visit our web site real-mccoys.com
Thanks.

One part however that I disagree with is the  downplaying of the Civil War and its effect on the feud. This debate will  go on forever no doubt.  Fact is that most of the McCoys were of the Union  Army and most of the Hatfields were of the Conferate Army. When the war was  declared over the sons of these two families had to come back into the same  valleys and try to live as neighbors...so..""do the math"".",955929600,2,557,4.2075471698113205
