7979753,5,B000087HCH,This movie was  great. The movie was not my usual type of movie however it did capture my attention. I was very surprised to find I enjoyed every minute of it. Wonderful service too. It can't be beat!,1372809600,,200,4.2631578947368425
7979754,3,B000087HCH,I guess I expected more from a William Shattner movie. It was OK but could have been much better.,1273449600,,97,4.157894736842105
7979755,4,B000087HCH,"Mr. Shatner produces, directs and stars in this b-grade sci fi story that frankly is better than one might expect. Yes, b-grade, but Shatner brings his sense of fun and adventure to this 'area 51' alien story. Is he a good guy or a bad guy or simply a guy with his own agenda? You have to watch it, but here's my opinion....

I was told by some that this film was not very good. I beg to differ. If judged as a b-grade sci fi it was more than good. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not since Trek has Shatner done sci fi in such a gut-level fun way. And yes, I saw the pretrek Incubus when it was released, and Groom Lake is far better a watch in my opinion, not to mention it's in English.

Groom Lake is a Saturday afternoon in an archair with popcorn and soda.",1233619200,6,755,4.026666666666666
7979756,5,B000087HCH,"I found this ""gem"" to be highly entertaining. Sure, it is not the best movie, but if you are a Shatner fan you've got to see it. The gospel singer is especially good, though it was a shame that most of her scenes were cut.",1196035200,5,222,3.9555555555555557
7979757,1,B000087HCH,"I agree with some of the other customers.  This movie was absolutely theee worst!!  The acting was bad, the script was bad,

the whole plot was bad!!  But you know what? I'm gonna buy it!

The reason is it was filmed in our home town in Arizona and my

son got to be in the movie!  He was the one who saved the alien from the evil man's clutches and freed the alien off of the tow truck where he was imprisoned.  So in a sense, my boy was the hero of the movie!  So that's why I'm buying this classic! Maybe some day my boy will make it big and someday say ""remember when....?"".",1141776000,3,578,3.9565217391304346
7979758,1,B000087HCH,"Absolutely the worst sci-fi movie ever made. The filming is much to close up and more suited to x-rated movies. Script, acting and directing aren't much better and the special effects (or the lack of it) are very low-budget. Don't buy or even rent this. See ""Communion"", ""Roswell"", ""Fire in the Sky"" or ""Intruders"" for some serious UFO stuff.",1060560000,5,342,4.813559322033898
7979759,1,B000087HCH,"This movie has three different plots, none of them concluded, a lot of forgiveness by the audience needed. Even then...",1044316800,,119,5.0
7979760,1,B000087HCH,"This science fiction love story is set against the backdrop of a small desert town in southeastern Arizona, where a young woman named Kate (who has a terminal illness,) sets out to prove the existence of extraterrestrials, thereby reaffirming that life does not end with the death of our physical bodies.
In the movie, Kate and her husband Andy travel to an eccentric desert town called Groom Lake on the outskirts of a military base. The town, made famous by tall stories of UFO and alien encounters, lures the young couple in. Soon they find themselves witness to strange events and sightings. Ultimately, their investigation brings them face to face with a military conspiracy and the truth behind the alien mystery.
With this film, William Shatner (the director) is channeling the ghost of Ed Wood - only without the considerable talents (relatively speaking) of Vampira or Bela Lugosi to save the day. Because of, or in spite of, the fact that this film was shot entirely on video, the lighting, depth of field, and overall image quality are very poor.
And the acting! Terrible! And the writing! Intolerable! And the directing! Insufferable!
We're talking weapons-grade stinker here!
Watching this film, I've learned that terminally-ill women are supposedly driven to a sexual frenzy when their whiney husbands recklessly roll their SUVs down mountainsides. I've learned that Tom Cruise look-alikes were lonely in school & didn't get any attention on Valentine's day, thus making them sensitive. I've learned that aliens love to ""rip the pussies"" out of cows, thus giving Mr. Shatner a giggly opportunity to make a movie that thinks it sounds ""all growed up"" like ""South Park.""
I've also learned that the aliens from the ST-TNG episode ""Encounter at Farpoint"" do moonlighting work in low-budget films. (I swear, the alien acending to space looked exactly like the tentacled, saucer-shaped critter form that episode.)
I hope that Saddam doesn't get hold of this bomb, because if he does, we're all dead.",1042243200,5,2007,5.084848484848485
