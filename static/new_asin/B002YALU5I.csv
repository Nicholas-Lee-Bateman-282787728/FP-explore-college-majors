8384110,5,B002YALU5I,A wonderfully engaging video series that is very informative! It gives practical instructions for keeping carnivorous plants and has a magnificent overview of many species available in the hobby! I ended up purchasing all 3 Volumes and have thoroughly enjoyed each. When I re-potted my Nepenthes and took cuttings for propagation I re-watched portions of Volume 3 several times. I could re-watch the species overviews many many times as they are so well done and do a great job of showing the diversity. A must watch for anyone interested in keeping carnivorous plants!,1417564800,,569,5.129032258064516

8384112,5,B002YALU5I,"This is part two of the Carnivorous Plant growing series put out by the two gentlemen at [...]. And once again it is a very highly informative teaching DVD on the art of successfully growing carnivorous plants, mainly sundews and butterworts. The instructions are very concise and taught from the perspective that you know absolutely nothing about these specialized plants. And they do it in a manner that does not give you the feeling that they are ""talking down"" to you. They explain in a very calm friend-to-friend conversational tone everything you need to know to succeed in growing these plants. If you are going to try to grow these plants, it should be required that you also obtain this DVD. You will not regret it.",1279584000,2,724,4.753968253968254
8384113,5,B002YALU5I,"Everybody knows about the Venus Flytrap but this DVD teaches you how to grow a REAL carnivorous plant!

Sundews are amongst my favorite carnivorous plants because they really do catch a lot of prey.  The Flytrap is fun to watch move so quickly but these plants are more effective in removing those pesky little nats and things that get in your face.  Oh, and they move too (just not as quickly)!  They are beautiful and now, with this DVD, they are easy to grow.

I've tried growing butterworts in the past but didn't have much success.  However, now I have this DVD so I know I can succeed at growing them.  I think it's time to try a butterwort again -- just because this DVD makes growing these plants easy.

I have a ""green thumb"" but carnivores were still difficult to grow.  Watching the DVD is engaging and entertaining and educational.  It was difficult giving up on everything I thought I knew about growing these plants.  But I did as told.  Now, someone's telling me the right things to do and my plants are healthy and even produce blooms!",1278633600,2,1051,4.502645502645502
