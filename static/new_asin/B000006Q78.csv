7904928,4,B000006Q78,"Although this video was produced in 1993 immediately following the first World Trade Center bombing, it predicted the likelihood of more to follow.  The video begins by portraying the group responsible for the bombing and how their leader, a sheik living and preaching death warrants in New York and New Jersey, helped orchestrate the attack.  The expose cites several menacing flaws within our system like the fact that the INS issued a student visa to the sheik just prior to the attack, even though he had been on the FBI's list of identified terrorists connected with the assassination of Anwar Sadat.
The video goes on to describe Aum Shinriko, the group who released a deadly sarin gas attack in a Tokyo subway, as well as a U.S. citizen who taught the IRA to make proximity fuses for their bombs.  The over riding themes throughout the film were that U.S. openness would make it terribly easy for terrorists to operate within our borders and that technology was making it easier for terrorists to collude with each other.
Good solid account of terrorism, although a bit dated.",1018742400,,1083,4.8432432432432435
