The bad, the host of the show kept pointing out that it was the democrats that were for slavery and then pointed out that the democrats of today are for abortion.  What does that have to do with black heroes.  Maybe you have another agenda.",1453420800,,301,4.339285714285714

8363757,5,B002CA68K2,"I almost fell out of my chair when I saw and heard some of the well documented stories of oppression and who was responsible. Numerous examples of oppressive government officials and pitiful representation. This honest display of accurate history tells parts of the American story that seems to have been locked away. Not only is injustice strongly and clearly documented here, but there are many examples of unsung Revolution era and civil war era American heroes of African decent who fought for freedom, liberty, God given equal rights and unity in America. Their stories were taught to generations past, but the educational system seems to be no longer interested in telling the stories on this DVD. Black history month and Hollywood seem to ignore these great contributors to the American liberty story as well, but that's no reason for you to.

There are stories of patriots who greatly assisted the American victory against the British. There are stories of judicial activism and abuse of power by some politicians. There are inspiring stories of some who worked hard and achieved great things after abolition was the law of the land. From bondage to the revolution through the Civil War and on through the civil rights laws of the 1960s, this DVD brings heroes, documents and history out into the light for all to see. Enlightening and Inspiring.",1259193600,7,1354,4.991150442477876
