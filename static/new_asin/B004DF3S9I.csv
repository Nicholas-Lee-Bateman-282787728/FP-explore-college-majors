8425253,5,B004DF3S9I,"i did this workout on VHS tape when i was stationed aboard the USS Acadia in San Diego.  excellent workout video because tamilee webb explains what part of your stomach muscles you are working on.  the original VHS tape just had the three sections of ab workouts; now this workout is on dvd ( have it in my workout collection) and it now includes how you can make your ab workout more intense by adding exercise equipment such as an exercise ball or an aerobic step to your workout.  tamilee says toward the end of the dvd, even though the hairstyle and workout outfits have change, the workout does not. this is a must for your dvd collection. five stars is my vote, also, this comes in a three pack along with buns of steel three, and arms and abs of steel",1479686400,,758,4.323943661971831
8425254,5,B004DF3S9I,"I had this back on VHS way back when and it was such a go to. At that time, I didn't have kids and had the time to hit the gym - but this was still a great addition to my cardio and gym routine. Now I have 2 kids under 2 and it's a savior... I cut it down to 30 minutes of just the squats/lunge portion and I am always sore the next day. my husband can always tell when I have been making time to squeeze it in ;) ... I loved it 15 years ago and I still love it today!",1377129600,,468,3.466666666666667
8425255,5,B004DF3S9I,Good product just like the original VHS. I would recommend it for anyone. Good exercise product to do at home.,1353801600,,110,4.55
8425256,5,B004DF3S9I,This is the best ab workout.  Easy to follow and very effective.  Have been using this for years.  Was thrilled when it was put into DVD format.,1347926400,3,144,4.2592592592592595
8425257,1,B004DF3S9I,"This product does not actually contain any of the Buns of Steel workouts which is why I gave it one star. It does contain the original Abs of Steel workouts which feels slightly outdated. I would not recommend this as in my opinion it is not what it advertises. If you are interested in the Abs of Steel workout I would suggest Tamilee's ""The Best of Tamilee: Abs, Abs, Abs."" as it has 7 of her best abs workouts updated for your viewing pleasure. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TATL9G/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00",1344988800,,518,5.105882352941176
8425258,5,B004DF3S9I,Excited about this DVD. I wore out my VHS copy of this work out and really love the DVD. Easily go from warm up to work out.,1340323200,2,124,3.6296296296296298
8425259,5,B004DF3S9I,This was great! It was the same exercises that I used many years ago but just on DVD! It includes some extra tips on how to get more out of the workout.,1310947200,5,152,3.78125
8425260,4,B004DF3S9I,"I must have misunderstood the video description, as I thought the DVD included both the Buns of Steel and Abs of Steel workouts.  Alas, it does not, it only includes the Abs of steel. Recently, my physician released me from surgical restrictions, so I have not seen results yet, as I have just begun to use the DVD regularly. Certainly, I can feel the burn and I know that the video helping me to strengthen the muscles that have been weakened. 4 stars and not 5 because I haven't been using it long enough to confidently say that this video will help me to lose inches.",1304899200,,570,4.377358490566038
