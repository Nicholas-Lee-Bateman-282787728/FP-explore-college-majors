7000778,4,B00T5DYUTK,Very suspenseful.  Kept me guessing. Great flic.,1433116800,5,48,5.857142857142857
7000779,3,B00T5DYUTK,The movie was ok the lead actress I forget who she is was really annoying to me I guess you really have to watch the movie to know what i mean all in all it was a good movie a lot of violence and it was exciting,1431648000,,211,3.5106382978723403
7000780,2,B00T5DYUTK,"The reviews I read before purchasing this were very vague and now I understand why - The plot is weak and unoriginal. There is something happening at the house across the street - and it is something we have definitely seen before in everything from books, horror movies, to lifetime movies. The main character is severely depressed and angry and we don't learn the reason why until the end of the film. This makes it difficult to sympathize with her/understand her reasoning behind her actions. I would have offered up her story sooner in the movie to help us build a connection with her. Since everything is so vague for the first half of the movie, you really have to motivate yourself to keep watching. I would definitely save your money and wait until this becomes available on Prime.",1431043200,9,789,4.683453237410072

7000782,3,B00T5DYUTK,"Okay, the plot is lame, and the fact that Eric Roberts is in this movie makes it even worse-or so I thought. The main actress in the movie does an awesome job and I hope that she gets a chance to act in a decent movie one day. What a waist of talent.",1429315200,5,250,3.7358490566037736
7000783,1,B00T5DYUTK,$6.99 is way too much for this low budget PPV movie. This should have been free for Prime members.,1428969600,3,98,4.2105263157894735
7000784,5,B00T5DYUTK,Nothing better than moving to a new neighborhood and starting over until you realize there is something evil is going on in the house across the street.  Never expected the twist and turns -- a weird sense of chill comes over you!  Recommend!,1428883200,4,242,4.604651162790698
7000785,1,B00T5DYUTK,"Not no but HELL no! This movie was terrible. It look like it was shot on someone's home video camera.  Aside from a few ""twist"" that simply didn't work, nothing was explained properly, and had enough plot holes to drive a Mack truck through.",1428710400,2,241,4.4772727272727275
7000786,4,B00T5DYUTK,"I enjoyed this psychological thriller that's a throwback in many ways to movies of the past.  Some nice performances from a number of recognizable names and faces (Ethan Embry, Courtney Gains, Alex Rocco) and a story that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat until the climactic moment.",1428624000,4,292,4.84

8700438,5,B00T5DYUTK,The House Across the Street is very good film with a slow burn intensity with an exciting payoff at the end.  I definitely recommend this to anyone to check out.,1461369600,,161,4.366666666666666
8700439,5,B00T5DYUTK,"Jessica Sonneborn Performs Her Magic in Portraying a Beautiful & Troubled Young Woman with a Mysterious Past !!!!
If this were a Major Production, there is no doubt in my mind, that SHE would be Competing for an Oscar for this Explosive Role !!!
  This Story is a Brilliant Psycho-Thriller than keeps the viewer guessing & questioning throughout the Movie !
The Cast is Supplemented with the Always Intriguing Presence of Eric Roberts; & the Late Great Alex Rocco, putting in another Dead-On Performance !
  The Story Ties all the leads up at the Surprising End; & Still Leaves You with Some Questions that You have to work out for Yourself >
a Sign of a Great Flik !!!",1456099200,,669,4.5966386554621845

8700441,4,B00T5DYUTK,"I liked it. Kept me guessing, eerie and strange characters. It was very moody.  A little slow in parts, but overall a fun thriller.",1441238400,,131,4.458333333333333
8700442,1,B00T5DYUTK,Not very good,1440806400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8700443,2,B00T5DYUTK,"Not worth the money.  Amature performancces and boring script,",1437264000,,62,5.888888888888889
8700444,2,B00T5DYUTK,"Amy (Jessica Sonneborn) leaves Kansas where nothing ever happens to a small town where nothing ever happens. She notices odd things going on at the house across the street. Off of her anti-psychotic meds, she investigates to dismay of the neighbors and police. Oh yeah, there is a missing girl.

The film was rather boring. The script lacked decent lines and Jessica Sonneborn was not convincing. Note the knife on DVD cover....think gun instead. I could compare it to other films, but that would ""ruin"" the ending. Also the sound recording picked up a lot of distracting background noise.

Soft 2 stars. No swearing, sex, or nudity...I think. There were some single frame flashbacks that I didn't pause. $9.76 US WALMART",1437177600,5,721,4.950413223140496
8700445,1,B00T5DYUTK,Good story line but the movie itself is pathetic...poor acting  ...definiely not worth paying for.,1433376000,,98,5.533333333333333
