8334275,5,B001PQN7WQ,"This man is an excellent teacher. As a beginner bassist, there are so many unanswered questions. John Sternal tries his best to help you understand . God knows how many books I have bought to help me understand music theory on bass guitar. Very simple stuff but if you don't have good direction it could be frustrating. I am so happy I bought this DVD. He covers rhythm, intervals, tells what a melody is, what is a harmony, explains the circle of fifths which I had no clue how to use, chord extensions, key changes, triads and beyond because he explains how many sharps or flats is in each 12 notes scale pattern . Good stuff. This is a must have for beginner to intermediate bass players. Having a strong foundation is extremely important . And I am very grateful for this DVD. I am a very inquisitive player, I simply just don't want to play, I want to understand what I am doing and why this or that.",1464998400,3,905,4.3609467455621305
