The narration is mediocre, the comedy is corny at times, and not all of the footage is fantastic. You could relate this video to a compilation of silly YouTube animal clips set to live, comical narration; the animal kingdom's version of ""America's Funniest Home Videos."" Animal Bloopers is no 2005 ""March of the Penguins."" However, I have owned this movie since its release, and watched it until I was eight years old. I enjoyed it because I was a ""zoology fan"" of sorts, and just liked learning about animals. So if you have children around and need an educational yet fun way to amuse them for a while, this is one movie I would recommend. It is clean, cheap (from what I see the price is here on Amazon), and humorous, but not void of educational value. For instance, when describing the goofy animal behaviors in the video, the narrator will attach a few brief words of zoological fact which offer reasons for the behaviors. Overall, I would say Animal Bloopers is certainly not a waste of money on animal lovers from ages four to ten. Some adults (moms and grandparents come to mind) might think it is cute, or even chuckle-worthy, but I imagine most would not find its imperfections very worthwhile.

Alternatively, if you are looking for a more informative and educational zoology-based video, look around for the Reader's Digest: Natural World of Animals VHS set. They have GREAT picture, smooth and clear (if not slightly dramatized) narration, and enjoyable background music that doesn't detract from the rest of the film.

We also have Bonkers For Babies which is not as impressive but still worth seeing for the educational value.",1053907200,,277,4.791666666666667
