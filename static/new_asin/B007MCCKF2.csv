8519495,3,B007MCCKF2,"This 4-Disc collection features these two Documentary Series: AMAZING WAR MACHINES and VICTORY BY AIR. In all, Aviation and History buffs will find over 14 Hours of interesting documentaries. I think this is a decent DVD Set, but it could have been a lot better. The main problem is with the second series, VICTORY BY AIR; the narration is terrible. This is not only my opinion, read the reviews for this documentary here on Amazon, most people agree that the narrator is, at best, very odd. Also the quality of the footage is not great. I still think aviation buffs will enjoy watching this documentary, but the narration ruined the fun for me. The other series you'll find on this set, AMAZING WAR MACHINES, is a lot better and the narration for this one is very good. So overall this is a decent collection, but I think it could have been a lot better.
