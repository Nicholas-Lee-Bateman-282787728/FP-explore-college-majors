1581426,5,B00005JNTY,My sister and I love this show and we watch it together over the phone. Since it comes from the same people that wrote My So Called Life we are a bit afraid that we are going to get screwed again and there will only be one season or it will get cancelled. So we fans need to stick together and keep this show going and vote for it to be released on dvd.,1106438400,,353,3.7837837837837838
1581427,5,B00005JNTY,This is an awsome show that me and my girlfriend love to watch together. Unfortunatly we havn't been able to keep up with it as much as we'de like too. We've missed some show and it sucks because it's our favorite show. We both really hope they put it on DVD.,1106006400,,259,4.098039215686274
1581428,5,B00005JNTY,"Life As We Know It is a great show for any teenager. It is very realistic but the way the situations are dealt are much less ""chessy"" than other televisions shows.

The show circles around the main character named Dino Whitman, and around his two best friends Ben, and Jonathan. He is your average jock. He likes girls. He likes sex. And he likes sports. Same as all the rest? No. In this show we see all the different emotions he goes through. From breaking up with his longtime girlfriend, to watching his parents marriage break apart. Sean Faris (who plays the character), is an excellent actor, and portrays Dino in a very positive and refreshing way.

All the actors are very good, and not at all overacting, which is nice to see. The storylines are very addictive, and very sexually oriented. In this short first season we see Ben and Mrs. Young (a school teacher) have a sexual relationship, a mother and gym coach having a short affair, people wanting to have sex, lying about sex, and so on.

This series has amazing potential, and i'm glad that the first season will be released on dvd. I RECOMMEND IT!",1105920000,3,1112,4.55
7942070,5,B00005JNTY,"I LOVED Life As We Know It.  It was funny and it dealed with problems that teens have today.  It wasn't fair that the show was put on at the same time as The OC.  Sean Faris (Dino), Chris Lowell (jonathan) and Jon Foster(ben) were fabulous on this show and i hope it is put on dvd.",1113004800,,281,3.8947368421052633
7942071,5,B00005JNTY,"I was SOOOO disappointed to find out this show was canceled. You can't expect a new show to gain an audience when putting it up against established shows like Survivor and The Apprentice with such large fan bases.

BRING LAWKI TO DVD! Then I can enjoy all the episodes all over again, as well as the two unaired shows I have yet to see!",1112832000,,336,4.25
7942072,5,B00005JNTY,"This was my favorite show ever!! Right after i watched the first episode i knew it was my FAV. show, and i loved it! I never missed a epiosde!! All the characters were so awesome, and all the guys really hot! I would LOVE if LAWKI was on DVD. So many people would buy it!",1111881600,,271,3.9454545454545453
7942073,5,B00005JNTY,"This was a great show that just wasn't given much of a chance!  Only 10 aired episodes that were rarely advertised and always went on random hiatus for 3 weeks at a time, going up against some of the top shows including The Apprentice, CSI, and the OC is not what I would consider giving a show a fair chance to gain an audience.  This show was fantastically drenched in sex and other affairs, and was interesting from beginning to end.  The quirky relationships between the characters was cute and constantly had me laughing.  I would love to see this dvd come out so I can see the last two unaired episodes.",1111104000,,609,4.410714285714286
7942074,5,B00005JNTY,The Life as we know it DVD will be great! This is the best written drama to be shown in years.,1111104000,,94,3.5238095238095237
7942075,5,B00005JNTY,"When I first heard about this show I wasn't interested or going to watch it based on what my friend said it was about. But when an add popped up on my screen about 5 minutes before the first episode aired I decided I'd give it a shot and watch it. When it was over I knew I was already hooked on the show and wouldn't ever miss an episode. There were quite a few things about the show which intrigued me, from Dino's sex addiction to Jonathan's love for Deborah but in the end what really got me into the story was Ben's infatuation with his English teacher, Ms. Monica Young.

Their relationship is one rarely seen on TV but with how the writers portrayed their interest in one another it's a relationship which viewers are able to fall in love with and realate to real life. A lot of people out there are close minded to a teacher student relationship but after seeing them interact with each other it's impossible not to get caught up in the belief that they're in love.

There are so many angles and storylines interwined on this show, it's hard not to get lost in all of the goings-on. The three main characters, Jon, Dino and Ben are all head over heals obsessed with sex and everything which it contains, but what teenage guy isn't? Something about this show draws viewers in and makes it possible for me and thousands of other teenagers to relate their lives to what goes on in the show. This show is different than any other show about teenagers out there. It's as if they aren't even TV characters, they're just three guys taken out of high school and recorded then put on TV for everyone to watch what happens in their lives.

From the beginning I had a hunch that this show would never make it past the first season (if we were even lucky to get a full season). I also didn't expect to get caught up and so involved with a show so much after the ending of Friends but it turns out that I did. I was so glad to hear that we might be getting the DVD and since it's our last ray of hope for the show I'm praying we get this as a keepsake and momento.",1109376000,3,2059,4.207594936708861
7942076,5,B00005JNTY,This is the best show and hopefully DVD ever. This show is amazing especially because of its cast dealing with Sean Faris and Jon Foster. Sean Faris is the best actor and is a total hottie so many teens like the show. This show was a big hit on ABC and should be put on DVD. It talked about three 16 year old boys' life dealing with sex and highschool. Every young adult should see it. I know I miss the show and many others do. By putting it on DVD we'll be able to see it at home so I feel you should put this show on DVD. It really sucks how they haven't aired the last two episodes and with the DVD you'll be able to see them so that works out great. Write to the show or send an email to amazon saying you want to buy the DVD to show that it has loyal viewers and they'll put it on DVD or add another season. I love Life As We Know It!!! Do what ever you can to save LAWKI !!!!!!,1109203200,,884,3.7837837837837838
7942077,5,B00005JNTY,"I loved life as we know it. It was my favorite show because it related to many teens across the country. It dealt with peer pressure and other situations that I am/was common to in my life. I hope this show will come out on DVD, because it is greatly missed, atleast by me and a lot of my friends. It would be wonderful to be able to see the show once again, and it would deffinitley be a collectible.",1109116800,,401,4.025
7942078,5,B00005JNTY,Life as we know it is the best teen drama out there. It's so more realistic and the kids aren't stuck up and rich like they are on the O.C. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD to see all the extras and see the 2 unaired episodes.,1108771200,,232,3.66
7942079,5,B00005JNTY,I LOVE LAWKI!!!!! its sooo much like my life & friends. same peer pressure & situations i live everyday. unfortunately this show got cancelled :*( so the dvd is a keepsake,1108771200,,171,4.548387096774194
