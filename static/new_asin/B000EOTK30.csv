8112443,2,B000EOTK30,"The problem for a beginner like me, trying to learn ""Alice's Restaurant,"" is that Gilewitz goes too fast with his instruction. He talks fast and shows all to quickly the chords, and which strings to strike. I got lost right away. I prefer Mike Herbert who has instruction in ""Alice's Restaurant"" and other pieces. Instruction done slowly for the beginner, with tablature provided. Richard Gilewitz isn't a good teacher for the beginner, I'm sorry to say.",1195603200,,454,4.9868421052631575
