8686014,5,B00P0KH29C,"While I haven't purchased this disc, I wanted to take a moment to comment on one of the seller's other items (which I have purchased): the handmade reproduction of the 'official' Mystic Knights of the Sea building plaque that was both outside the door of the lodge and inside Kingfish's office. This is a gorgeous reproduction that is beautifully made and every fan of the old television show (1951-1953) will appreciate it. Check it out, you won't be sorry.",1469923200,,458,4.810126582278481
