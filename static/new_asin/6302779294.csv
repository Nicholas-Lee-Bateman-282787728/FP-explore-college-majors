510332,5,6302779294,"Ignore the recent Matt Damon/Franke Potente GenX-ified bastardization of Robert Ludlum's wonderful book because the Richard Chamberlain/Jaclyn Smith version is the only version that actually faithfully adheres to core details and elements of the novel.  If you really want to appreciate the Jason Bourne Series, read the trilogy, and then go out and buy this DVD.  There isn't enough space here to recommend the mini-series highly enough or to explain just how thorough and horrid a mutilation the recent film really is of both the characters and the story.",1025913600,27,557,5.247191011235955
510333,4,6302779294,"I just spent 17 bucks going to see the 2002 release of this story.  Had I known it was going to be so bad I would have spent the money buying this on tape.  I remember watching this when it first ran on tv, and I agree with most of the current online reviews.  Considering it was done when it was done and for the medium it was done in, it wasn't a bad production at all.  I loved the book and was very intertained by the mini series.  The current release is a farce and I hope that I can save a few people some money.  Get this on tape and stay home on the couch.  The 2002 Bourne Identity will make it to tv much sooner than you think.",1024272000,7,637,3.816793893129771
510334,5,6302779294,"I've read the book, viewed the tv movie and watched the newly released remake movie.  I enjoyed the remake, however the book was so much better than the story told in the remake movie.  A lot of the intrigues were lost, but the movie was updated to our current time and technologies.
Although the tv movie was not totally true to the book, I want to see it again.  It is the closest you'll get to the book without reading it. Richard Chamberlain, at the time the tv movie was aired, was a convincing lead character.  I read the book years after seeing the the TV movie and felt that although he was not the Bourne character as written in the book, he worked out fine for the movie.
I guess this discussion about Richard Chamberlain and Matt Damon is similiar to the reasons Anne Rice objected to Tom Cruise in Interview with a Vampire.  Tom Cruise was fine in the movie, but once you read the book you realized he was defintely miscasted as the Laestat character as written in the book.
When you read the book and get the full story, sometimes it changes your perception about the characters. Richard and Matt may be fine in the movie, but once you read the book, your perspective about the casting may change.",1024272000,7,1210,4.408071748878924
510335,5,6302779294,"Well I wanted to give Matt Damon a chance so I just saw the remake. Almost totally untrue to the book. In the original movie and book, Bourne is a construct that Treadstone is using to draw out an international terrorist and killer. The remade of the movie changes the entire premise of the the story. Since I can't give away the plot I'll just have to say that I was very disappointed that Ludlum's fine work was butchered so badly by the remake with Damon. Let's hope that the original will come out on DVD soon and put this poor remake to rest. I definately wouldn't pay to see it again.",1024272000,5,590,4.276785714285714
510336,5,6302779294,"The book is one of the few that i really treasure and much to my delight, it was turn into a tv miniseries with two of my fave actors, Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith--the King & Queen of Miniseries! This is a well-made action/thriller with beautiful and haunting music by Laurence Rosenthal and piercing photography by Tony Pierce. Acting wise, both actors are superb. Jaclyn Smith is excellent as the Canadian economist kidnapped by Bourne. The scene where she is trying to escape from Bourne, running and trying to grab moving cars' doors is one of the highlights and the time where she was being assaulted by the guy who is going to kill her is well executed. Richard Chamberlain is superb, although not my first choice, and he deserves the Golden Globe nomination for the role. Their on screen action scenes where Chamberlain used Smith as a hostage, running inside the car park, will grab you in your seat! This is a violent, explosive, screaming with thrill and suspense espionage. A definite must for lovers of this genre!",998697600,14,1035,4.787709497206704
510337,4,6302779294,"For people who have read the book by Ludlum, this movie will come at first as a bit of a disappointment. Chamberlain seems somewhat old for the role of Bourne and the plot has been greatly simplified. On the other hand,  there are still enough turns to keep the attention and the supporting cast  does a good job of filling out their somewhat two-dimensional characters.  If you forget about the book, this is really quite a good movie. It is a  bit overlong and especially the beginning has been stretched to much, but  there is a lot of suspence and action so on the whole nobody needs to be  bored.",951350400,5,601,4.418181818181818
510338,4,6302779294,"Except for a slight but noticeable change of events at the end of the movie this film remains true to the book.  Good acting along with a good  story makes for a good time and that is what happened here.  By filming on  local in various European settings the viewer enjoyes a beautiful piece of  work.  Not the best international intrigue movie ever written, for that  check out THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, but close to it.",940809600,,421,4.3896103896103895
510339,4,6302779294,"Based on what is arguably Robert Ludlum's best novel, and in truth one of the best of all spy thrillers ever written.  Richard Chamberlain gives one of the stronger performances of his illustrious career as a man that knows  less about himself than the viewer does at the beginning, and remains that  way for almost the entire movie.
Why is he able to immediately break down  a gun when prompted?  Why do men try to kill him for no reason?  Why is he  able to quickly defeat these attackers with fighting skills he never  remembers learning?  Why does he instinctually shoot a man in the throat?  And ultimately, what does all of this have to do with an international  terrorist known only as Carlos?  The pacing is superbly handled, exposing  bit by little bit of information as we learn more about this mysterious  man.
Great pacing, compelling mystery, exotic locales, and one of the  most exciting finales ever made by a TV studio, The Bourne Identity is  definitely a cut about the rest when it comes to television productions.  For those of you that think all TV movies are despicable (a belief that I  have adhered to for a very long time), know this: The Bourne Identity is  one of a rare breed of TV movies that is actually worth your time.",930700800,4,1249,4.545045045045045

510521,4,6302779294,"I first saw this movie on television many years ago, long before the Matt Damon Bourne Identity appeared on the screen, and even with the impressive production of the 2002 Damon-Liman collaboration, this 3-hour 1988 television movie remains my favorite adaptation of Robert Ludlums 1980 thriller. For one thing the extra hour plus that Chamberlains production has on the Damon effort gives the production a greater opportunity to focus on the very human conflict and remain more faithful to the source novel. One of the things that felt so jarring of the later effort was how it diverged so sharply from the Ludlum source. Of course world events had moved on in the 22 years between Ludlums book and Damons film so I understand they had to do some updating. This works to the benefit of the Chamberlain starrer which had no such encumbrance. The story details the struggle of a man washed up on a shore in southern France and nursed back to health by an alcoholic doctor (wonderfully played by Denholm Elliott) to regain his memory and recall his real name. Along the way he kidnaps and eventually befriends a beautiful doctor (of economics) played by my favorite of Charlies Angels Jaclyn Smith and evades pursuers working for the famed international assassin Carlos. Of course, to provide much more of a synopsis would spoil the enjoyment of the surprises of this film, but fans of the Damon actioner should be aware that, while this TV miniseries does feature some action sequences, the action is not the main emphasis of the movie, the concentration is most definitely on the human drama and intrigue (which I greatly enjoyed). All in all this is well worth a look-see and I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1393113600,2,1707,4.8493150684931505

510525,5,6302779294,"I still have a VCR player and though the quality on my 5' screen is not great, we enjoy the movie. DVD is much more expensive and the VHS is fine; great price. It is closer to the book than the latest film, all three are great and I highly recommend the original book as a great thriller.

I like the movie with both actors,  Richard Chamberlain and Matt Damon.  They are both very good actors and the ending of the

I tortured myself through hour and hour of it (188 minutes), and it proved to be consistently weak and ineffectual. It feels lacking in strength and force, the espionage premise is marked by an absence of style, the acting feels misused, its just not believable. Richard Chamberlain also did not seem that comfortable with his gun or handling himself when attacked. Chamberlain and Smith were not plausible characters - Smith was too ""superficial"", as was Chamberlain.

This film seems without preparation, it seems like romance not an Adventure entertainment film, if nothing else, it seems like an incompetent version of the Robert Ludlum story. This was a clumsy, almost without any definite aim, direction, rule, or method film.

510628,5,6302779294,"If you've read & enjoyed the multi-layered, intricate tapestry that was a NY Times #1 Best Seller, then you will enjoy this INCREDIBLY faithful adaptation !
Fitting so much of the novel's 523 - 608 pages of intricate DETAIL into a mere three hours is IMPRESSIVE !
I just finished the last page of the novel, then watched this TV Movie. There were many details & nuances where they could've cut corners & simplified, yet they didn't ! There were only 4 points where they ""went Hollywood,"" but without sacrificing fidelity to the tone of Ludlum's original novel.
Director Roger Young & Teleplay/Screenplay author Carol Sobieski did an outstanding job !

This originally aired on ABC in two, 2-hour parts on Sunday: May 8, 1988 (Mothers' Day) and Monday: May 9, 1988. Sobieski's writing (and Jaclyn Smith's performance) make this version subtly ""more accessible"" for women gathered around a TV screen in 1988.
While the three-hour length may be a bit much for some viewers to do ""in one sitting,"" the DVD divides the movie into ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"" (reflecting the original air dates), which easily supports a ""two-night viewing experience.""

This was a far more nuanced adaptation, when compared to the 2002 Damon theatrical movie, where they threw out so MUCH of the detailed backstory.
(By his own admission, 2002 Director Doug Liman jettisoned much of the novel's content in an attempt to modernize it, and conform it to his own beliefs & family experience regarding US foreign policy)

Even down to ""Bourne's"" age. Some ""rough math"" based on the details of the book (Career, Nam, 1st Wife & Kids. Medusa, Tam Quan: 3-25-68) sets ""Bourne's"" D.O.B. as late as 1938 (apx).
That would mean by the time of the novel: 1980, he'd be at least 42.
By 1988, the 53-year-old Chamberlain (ironically born 1934) might have been a bit old to play the mid-forties ""Bourne.""
However at the time of the theatrical movie's shooting in 2000, 30-year-old Damon was also TOO young...

For Future Buyers: My only surprise was the (2002 Warner Video Standard) Snap Case. I had never seen one (much less opened one) before ! While it IS more ""eco-friendly,"" I was surprised at how fragile it seemed to be. I can see why the ""Keep Case"" became the industry standard. This is not a ""bootleg,"" this is simply the packaging that Warner Video was using in 2002 (Original Barcode 085392356522)

BOTTOM LINE: If you enjoy seeing most of the details of the 1980 novel meticulously & realistically transferred to cinema - this is the adaptation for you.
If you lack the time, or patience, and enjoy more of a fast-action movie, super-fast special effects, without as many layers to either the story or characters, go with the 2002 Doug Liman/Matt Damon movie, which clocks in 67 minutes shorter.",1364342400,2,2765,4.812631578947369

510660,5,6302779294,"I always thought this was the best movie that Richard Chamberlain made during his entire career. About 10 years ago I watched the remake with Matt Damon, but was extremely disappointed. I just didn't care for the actors and hated the short scenes which were making it hard to follow the plot. But the new generation of movie directors seems to think short scenes = more suspense. Well, they are wrong.
Since then I watched the original with Chamberlain & Jaclyn Smith a few times more and read the book. Great thriller and a very good novel. 10 stars!",1321401600,,551,4.575757575757576
510661,5,6302779294,"Based on of Robert Ludlum's suspenseful spy novel, this 1988 two-part TV movie begins with a man being shot in the head and falling off of a ship at sea, which subsequently sinks. The man washes ashore in Port Noir, France, and is found and cared for by Dr. Geoffrey Washburn, an alcoholic English doctor. The man can't remember his name; his nonfatal but nonetheless critical head wound has rendered him an amnesiac. Dr. Washburn also discovers, surgically implanted into his patient, microfilm with an account number for the Gemeinschaft Bank in Switzerland.

Bidding his benefactor farewell, the man travels to Switzerland in the hopes of rediscovering his identity. At a hotel whose name he inexplicably remembers he discovers his name is ""J. Bourne"" and that he works for an organization called Treadstone 71. More, but not enough, is revealed at the Gemeinschaft Bank where Bourne learns that the ""J"" stands for Jason, and that he is a rich man with fifteen million dollars to his name. But he still has no idea what Treadstone is, or why he recognizes the American man being interviewed on TV about the recent assassination of Ambassador Howard Leland.

Leaving, Bourne suddenly finds himself the target of hired killers posing as bank employees. He flees with the assistance of Dr. Marie St. Jacques, a Canadian economist in Switzerland for a conference. The pair, constantly dodging the killers from the bank, track down various informants who know little but suggest Bourne is connected to a notorious Spanish assassin named Carlos, and, worse, that Bourne may have been hired by Carlos to kill Ambassador Leland!

Is Bourne really who he - and everyone else - thinks he is? Is he a murderer? Did he kill Leland for Carlos? Just who exactly is Carlos? Why are the men from the Gemeinschaft Bank trying so hard to kill Bourne? Who do they answer to? What is Treadstone? And why does Bourne recognize the American from the television? All these questions and more will be answered by the time the film's three-hour runtime draws to a close in a satisfying (if a little jostling) finale in New York City, but not before more chases, shootouts, car crashes and tons of political intrigue and double-crosses.

A much more thoughtful and cerebral film than the remake starring Matt Damon, 'The Bourne Identity' is a bit slow in places but is never boring, and has plenty of twists and turns and surprises to keep viewers guessing. Richard Chamberlain is capable and likable in the lead role, and the supporting cast includes familiar faces like Denholm Elliott as the amusing and kindly Dr. Washburn, Shane Rimmer as stern, no-nonsense American Army General Conklin, Anthony Quayle as French General Villiers, and Wolf Kahler as the cold-blooded assassin nicknamed ""Gold Glasses.""",1313280000,3,2784,4.967811158798283
510662,1,6302779294,"A lot of reviews here loved this, but I'm sorry, this is just pathetic 80's kitsch miniseries. Cleaned and sanitized for TV, the screenplay is nothing more than a redaction of the book. Now that has pleased all the ""authoritarians"" who post here heaping praises for its adherence to the book, but it just does not work when you're doing that to get past the censor board. Chamberlain is woefully miscast as an action hero simply because somebody wanted to give him another chance to be bare-chested for the ladies. He was outstanding in earlier mini-series (yeah, THAT one especially, all the girls loved THAT one). I myself really enjoyed The Counte of Monte Cristo, that's actually one of my favorites that he's done. That's the type of role where he shines. But he's not capable of being perceived as a trained assassin. It's actually laughable. Smith is passable in her role, and I think she really tried to give it a good go but again the screenplay doomed everybody from the start. One glaring rewrite was after the rape, they gave Smith a gun so she could go Charlie's Angels on the bad guy, another huge mistake. And don't get me started on the crappy love scene...that was oh...so...bad.
As I said, it is very true to the book. So much so, any of you reading this review could have done as well. Just grab a pen and start crossing out stuff until you hit 3 hours of taping. What really has to happen to bring a book to the screen is to capture the essence of the book without deviating too far from the story line. And when I read the book, I had a picture of a grittier and meaner side of Jason Bourne. Now, I'm not going to tout Damon's series, it is more in line with what I thought the the book felt like, but yes it is waaaaay different because it was so updated to modern technology and the usual over-blown super-human capabilities that just ain't so. So much so, I am suprised they even bothered to call it Bourne, but they stole just enough of the plot concept to be forced to have to give credit where credit is due. It's a shame Ludlum himself wasn't around to give his opinion. I wonder if he ever said what he thought of the Chamberlain production. He was smart enough not to buy back the rights and every exisitng inch of film like Len Deighton did after the adaptation of his Game, Set & Match (which kept me riveted for 13 weeks on PBS).
My advice is to pass on this, I wish I had but I got suckered by the over-praising of most of the reviews here(you people are too sentimental and are not being objective). It's 3 hours I wish I'd never spent.",1307923200,3,2571,4.358333333333333

I found all the scenarios to be not only credible, but engaging.  I felt the female lead, Jackyn Smith,  made the transition from fearful victim, to co-conspiriter very believeable.  The Richard Chamberlain character was most engaging as the amnesiac who could not remember what we'd already been shown in the opening scenes.  I enjoyed the Doctor and the children in the early scenes as Jason is recovering from his physical injuries and venturing out into the village and onto the shore line.  I enjoyed the development of the plot and the suspense with which the Jackal is introduced and ultimately revealed and finally dispatched.  I liked the action scenes and the way Jason finally recovers his memory and identity.  I will enjoy watching this series many times over.",1273881600,6,914,5.006622516556291

I tortured myself through hour and hour of it (188 minutes), and it proved to be consistently weak and ineffectual. It feels lacking in strength and force, the espionage premise is marked by an absence of style, the acting feels misused, its just not believable. Richard Chamberlain also did not seem that comfortable with his gun or handling himself when attacked.  Chamberlain and Smith were not plausible characters - Smith was too ""superficial"", as was Chamberlain.

This film seems without preparation, it seems like romance not an Adventure entertainment film, if nothing else, it seems like an incompetent version of the Robert Ludlum story.  This was a clumsy, almost without any definite aim, direction, rule, or method film.

510747,3,6302779294,"As a deep fan of the Damon/Bourne series, I simply had to get this earlier version.

There are many similarities in the plot line: amnesia after the fall from the boat, the suspense of fighting killers who are a complete mystery, and the gradual recovery of the human inside.  Even the final action sequence - shooting up a stairway - is similar.

But the themes of this version are far far less dark.  Many of the bureaucratic operatives (often with the same names) in this are good guys, though expedient brutes are certainly present.  Not only is the Bourne-created persona in an entirely different circumstance that I do not want reveal as it is very fun to piece it together, but his mission has a much clearer focus.  Moreover, the nature of Bourne's training and what he went through are very different and in my opinion less interesting than the Damon version.  And his amnesia is due to a simple bump on the head, which radically alters the character's motivation and search.  Finally, in the end, it really is over, everything resolved and explained and for the most part happy - with some very interesting additions to David Webb's background - rather than the splendidly ambiguous ending to the Damon series.

I do not think I will watch this over and over to savor as I do the Damon series.  The chemistry between Chamberlain, who is a truly fine actor, and Smith does not quite ring true in my viewing.  While startlingly beautiful, Smith simply cannot compare to the complex personality as portrayed by Franka Potente in the Damon series.  Nonetheless, for a TV series, the Chamberlain version is extremely high quality, though I would never have sought it out on its own.

Recommended.  I guess now I will have to read the books.",1204761600,5,1745,4.697368421052632

It's only on watching the original that one realises how today's cinema has put such a demand on actors in terms of physical fitness in order to engage in far more explicit violence, and sex!

It's been extremely unkind of the promoters of the new Bourne trilogy not to mention that they take after a far more gentle Jason Bourne! What's more they also chronicle the same events!

I'm old enough to have watched the other Chamberlain miniseries of the era, but have no memory of this one. I found it entertaining, and surprising in how close it followed the first book. Chamberlain was a believable enough Bourne, but not nearly as menacing as the new Damon incarnation. It was sometimes a little hard to imagine Chamberlain as the Medusa killer from the VietNam War. Chamberlain would have made a better Bourne for the third book in the series, where Bourne is fifty. Jacklyn Smith was a pretty good Marie, and the intelligence and strength of the character was as it is in the book and a sharp contrast to the Marie played by Franka Potente in the first two movies. My only gripe with Smith was that she didn't come across as Canadian- more of a West Coaster. If you're one of those that belong to the cult that thinks Jacklyn Smith was the ""hottest"" Angel, you'll want to watch it for her performance alone.

I'm a car person, so I found the 80's fashions less distracting than the squared-off peculiar style of 80's cars. No one in the movie was wearing rubber band bracelets and balloon pants, just a few ""Golden Girl"" padded shoulders on Smith. The locations were great for a miniseries and you always knew and felt the stroy was taking place in Europe. Like I said earlier, it was entertaining to watch.

510782,4,6302779294,"Although filmed in 1988 The Bourne Identity is still very actual, the fight against terrorism being very much on today's agenda as well.  The two parts movie takes us mainly to Zrich, Paris and New York,  to locations so beautifully chosen as to make  the viewer wish he could visit them.

  A man looses his memory after being shot and enduring serious injuries. The story is his search of identity intelligently intertwined with the unfolding of an international secret services action to capture Carlos, a famous terrorist and assassin who kept the CIA and other intelligence agencies around the world on their toes for years.  The writers of the script certainly had an arduous  task condensing the complex plot, their talent created a compelling story, a sharp dialogue without ever confusing the viewer.

As mentioned  The Bourne Identity unfolds in three different cities. In each of them new elements and characters are added thus making the pace of the show pick up momentum until it reaches a cathartic peak on E 71st street.

The actor in the title role with whom we take the thrilling trip,  rather rollercoaster ride, could only be Richard Chamberlain. His unique acting arc displays, with intensity, finesse and perfection, loving moments -- his face melting with love and crying for sadness when his failing memory catches glimpses of the past,  his handsome and young body surrendering to the  talented and attractive Jaclyn Smith who falls under the spell of this intriguing man --  and tough and violent moments paired with callousness, cold blood, swiftness of reactions, distress and cruel realisations  as well as a formidable physical shape.  Richard Chamberlain IS Jason Bourne and he is the one who keeps the viewer's attention tense during the entire movie.

One of my preferred scenes is one confronting a French General played by the much missed Anthony Quayle and Jason Bourne/Richard Chamberlain, two great actors among the greatest, on stage and on the screen; so powerful a scene, it grips you, one almost forgets to breathe .... Magnificent acting, soldiers  !

The Bourne Identity ends with a moral note, Jason Bourne/Richard Chamberlain once his mission accomplished questions the violence and the need for men to become monsters to fight monsters.  In the very last scene, full of symbolism,  our hero, tightly holding the arm of Marie  St. Jacques/Jaclyn Smith walks out of a cemetery towards a new life where he hopes to make peace with himself and be capable of love again.

A last word to say that Martin Rabbett is coproducer, adding his great talent to the list of those who made The Bourne Identity a big success.",1156636800,6,2655,4.968253968253968

a) the books where set in a different era (70's 80's) and the ideas could not have transfered well to the late 90's/ 00's. main point being the vastly different technology we have now and the prominance of computers, satellite tracking etc.

b) the screenplay was written by ludlum himself before he died (just after the film was released or finished i believe)and was onset as an advisor. think theres an interview on the dvd with him. he realised that it couldn't be a straight adaption for the reasons laid out before and that the film would only be 90 min +. so don't use the its not faithful to the original argument. it was never intended to be. it was an interpretation. this miniseries was hardly spot on (well more so than the current film but the acting was way hammier which is always a killer in my book)

After watching the Chamberlin version, I came away wondering if the movie studio that put together the newer film wasn't trying to milk as much milage as they could out of a younger, sexier looking actor for their remake.  This Bourne is older, more experienced, and surprisingly, a lot more believable in this role.  No, the explosions weren't as visually catastrophic but the action never drags, not for one minute.  I purchase and watch DVD's for their plot line and content and have been disappointed a number of times by 70's and 80's movie-making attempts.  This one far outshines most from its genre.  One of the best DVD purchases I've ever made.",1138924800,12,968,4.818181818181818
510786,5,6302779294,"Having watched both the 1988 TV mini series and the 2002 movie remake, I can truly appreciate what marvelous job this 1988 version was.

The 2002 movie remake just pales in comparison. Comparing the 2 versions side by side, you feel the 2002 version feels more like an independent film on steroids more than anything else. While this 1988 version is much more cultured, sophisticated. The 1988 version actually grips you in its intensity.

And Richard Chamberlain, what can I say, one of the truly great actors to ever grace the screen in recent memory. In comparison Matt Damon feels more like a rebellious school kid, lacking Chamberlain's finess, culture, and sophistication.

I give this mini series 5 stars. Highly recommended.",1135468800,9,732,5.033057851239669
510787,5,6302779294,"I was excited when I heard that a remake of the Bourne Identity was set to be released in 2002.  But I was disappointed when I saw it.  I prefer the original TV version to the remake, which I consider a good example of a big budget revamp that really shouldn't have been billed as Robert Ludlum's Bourne Identity since it barely kept even a minimum of the original plot.  Personally I think they should have put more effort into updating the original instead of rendering it nearly unrecognizable to anyone who read the book.",1108425600,10,525,4.505263157894737
510788,4,6302779294,"Richard Chamberlain turns in an excellent performances in this made for TV version of Robert Ludlums great novel ""The Bourne Identity"". Jaclyn Smith shouldn't be an actress. Fortunately she is not carrying the movie. The other support cast is magnificent, and quite honestly beat out the Matt Damon versions in that respect. Fans of the Damon movie versions may not find quite as much action or special effects as in the new versions, but this TV version still is very well done. Considering the price and when this version was released, it has held up very well. This version is not the same either other than the overall premise, so even those that have seen the new version should find this one interesting. This version is truer to the book and Chamberlain is truer to the character. Fans of the Tom Clancy books and movies should enjoy it too. I own the newer versions as well and I thoroughly enjoyed this version. If you are a fan of Richard Chamberlain or spy dramas you will definitely want to get this one. Be sure to pre-order Ice Station Zebra too.",1104105600,10,1060,4.613756613756614
510792,4,6302779294,"I am another one of those people who did not check out the 1988 mini-series (why it is called a mini-series rather than a two-part made-for-television movie I do not know) based on Robert Ludlum's novel until after they had seen the 2002 theatrical thriller starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente.  For that matter I also saw the 2004 sequel, ""The Bourne Conspiracy"" before I got to this DVD where the main roles are played by big time small screen stars and top drawer beautiful people Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.

The character that we will come to know as Jason Bourne (Chamberlain) is shot on a fishing boat off the coast of France, falls overboard, and is washed ashore.  He is taken care of by Geoffrey Washburn (Denholm Elliott), a defrocked doctor who is able to save Bourne's life and help him uncover the first clues as to solving the mystery of his identity.  When they are attacked the question of his identity seems rather pressing, and ""Bourne"" heads off to investigate the first clue in Zurich.  But just as the first pieces are beginning to fall into place guys with guns start showing up and shooting at Bourne and he ends up taking a hostage, a Canadian economist named Marie St. Jacques, who in the end becomes the one person he can really trust and the proverbial much, much more.

The first part is better than the second part, because it focuses primarily on the mystery of Chamberlain's character discovering who he ""is,"" although all information is suspect, especially when it looks like Bourne is not just any trained assassin but the infamous Carlos.  Granted, Chamberlain was 53 at that point and too old for the role, but it is actually one of his better performances as the King of the Mini-Series.  Early on he has to pretend that he knows more than he does in order to get more information, and I like the bit he does when he is trying to dredge up information on places.  Eventually he gets to the point when he has enough confidence to start putting the screws to people as he gets closer and closer to the truth.  So, he might be too old but he is definitely doing more than just standing around and look pretty this time around.

The flaw in this version of ""The Bourne Identity"" is the romance between the two main characters.  I know it is a Hollywood staple that this sort of thing is supposed to happen, and when you have a pair this good look it is one of those consummations devoutly to be wished you hear so much about, but I just did not buy it when Marie decides the appropriate reaction to everything that has happened to her is to throw her self as Jason.  Aesthetics aside, it is just too much of a jump to bridge the first half and second half of the story.  Then there is the way Marie embraces the mission, which certainly speaks well for Canadian women because usually the female character in this position is neither as intelligent nor as brave.

The second half becomes a race to see if Bourne can get the bad guys before the bad guys or the good guys get him.  Things get a little muddled and it is not surprising that Bourne starts to lose it as everything starts coming down on his head.  The action sequences are basically people shooting each other, so that will seem rather tame after the big set pieces in the Matt Damon films, but the point here really is the mystery rather than the action, which is why this version of ""The Bourne Identity"" is well suited to television.  You will also appreciate it the more you remember the Cold War mentality that it reflects.",1099267200,16,3535,4.488299531981279
510793,5,6302779294,"From the startling opening to the heart stopping climax, 'The Bourne Identity' is a  riveting psychological thriller. Very true to Ludlum's book. Chamberlain is convincing in his role as Jason Bourne & Jaclyn Smith remains beautiful as the leading lady. Absolutely Terrific!",1096070400,4,274,5.523809523809524
510794,4,6302779294,"Unlike the Matt Damon movie (which I adore), this version of the Bourne Identity is very true to the book, with the only changes being some simplifications that didn't hurt the plot a bit.  So if you liked the book, I recommend the miniseries.  I think you'll enjoy seeing it come to life.  I certainly did.

I did not think Richard Chamberlain was miscast, as some have said.  I actually think he was probably more what Ludlum had in mind when he wrote the character-a sophisticated, well-traveled, well-trained assassin, reminiscent of James Bond.  I also think that Jaclyn Smith was more the Marie that Ludlum intended, as well.  Their chemistry worked for me.",1091664000,10,663,4.814159292035399
510795,5,6302779294,"After watching the dvd version of Matt Damon's version of ""The Bourne Identity,"" I can't help myself but watch again(!) the tv miniseries version. The new version is the typical action movie of the current trend to suit the taste of today's movie lovers and I can't disagree with the new audience liking it(I enjoyed it!)and it's hard not to make a comparison but the main reason why this miniseries version is, I believe--and I know most fans will agree-- is the two stars, Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. Both stars had a chemistry that Matt Damon and Franka Potente lack. Don't get me wrong, both Damon and Potente are good but the XXX factor doesn't click at all.
Anyway, it's great having both in my collection and maybe years from now, I'll do another review and make a comparison --just in case things changes......",1056153600,5,828,4.7172413793103445
510796,2,6302779294,"I don't know where all the glowing reviews are coming from but I couldn't be bothered to finish this snoozer.  The dialogue is as mono/bisyllabic as you can get and on par with your average Aaron Spelling production.  Chamberlain is a cold blooded killer just because he says so and not because anything we see of him.  The producer/director were too busy making him available to Jacklyn Smith to fall in love with and they take every opportunity to make googly eyes at each other.  ""I just need to be held"", she says.  Puh-leeeez!!!
I accidentally rented this one confusing it with the theatrical movie.  I want those two hours of my life that I wastes back.",1046822400,13,659,4.589743589743589
510797,3,6302779294,"Ok, so the book was really complex. This movie captures some of that complexity; a great deal more than the newer version does.
However. It's a TV miniseries, with no sense of humor at all (this doesn't mean you won't laugh - check out the love scene), and a limited effects budget. And some really overblown acting in places. And it still manages to be way more faithful to the book.
I seem to remember it being so much better... It helped that I was a kid and living in the 80's at the time and didn't know any better, I suppose. It's still really good, but that's more an effect of sticking to Robert Ludlum's plot than anything. And his plot was really superb, so that does go a long way toward making up for the other stuff.
Go read the book.",1035676800,10,747,4.230769230769231
510798,4,6302779294,"I read the book, and saw the recent movie with Matt Damon, which was full of ""special effects"" and short on Ludlum. This DVD is the reverse: it is a good story translated into a near great viewing experience. Why? Because it follows some long standing rules about story telling. It has characters that are believeable and a plot that moves briskly, but not at the high speed of the recent film. Richard Chamberlain is a consistantly good actor and he gives an excellent rendition of Jason Bourne here. Jaclyn Smith is an OK actress who is good enough so as not to drag down the pace of the film by being an unbelieveable character. The remainder of the cast, including Denholm Elliott, Donald Moffat and Anthony Quayle, all perform well, as would be expected of such excellent actors. The tranfer of a television ""miniseries"" to DVD is excellent, with one irritating exception; The pauses for commercials are still in place, when some judicious editing would have been an easy fix. Two other (minor) negatives are the score and the romance angle: the former is terrible, sounding saccharine in places where it shouldn't, and generally out of place in a film like this. The love scenes, especially the first, are like the worst of 80's soaps.. However, leaving the nitpicking aside, this is a nearly great visual experience. One BIG plus is the detail in filming European cities; it's fantastic. Seeing the intact WTC, in the new YOrk shots is a grabber though, at least to me.

An introductory scene with a body (Richard Chamberlain) sinking slowly in the water. It may have a few holes in it. It is found and unceremoniously dumped at the door of a doctor (Denholm Elliott). As he recovers from his wounds we realize he has amnesia. People are out to kill him. He had a capsule embedded in his body that contained what looks like a code. He must find out how he is and why people are out to get him. In the process it looks more and more that he is a well known terrorist.

The Bourne in the movie is much nicer than the book version. You have to make allowances for the transformation to the screen. However he does a lot more borrowing instead of stealing and is not as vicious with people on his travels.",1504742400,5,1023,4.268041237113402
