8041970,5,B0006OBPT0,"One of the best films I've ever seen. A poignant look at nomadic life in Mongolia's Gobi desert. The people, culture and animals in this film are beautiful - I cannot rave about this film enough; this one is not to be missed.",1413763200,,225,4.255813953488372
8041971,5,B0006OBPT0,"I have been severaly dissolutioned with the fare at most movie theatres and movie rental houses recently.  No sooner do I watch a movie, than I quickly forget it.  Then I saw ""The Story of the Weeping Camel.""  What a spectacular piece of film.  I was moved to tears, and humbled by the experience.  It is hard to put into words, all I know is that I was transfixed to this piece of art.  No movie theatrics here.  This quiet and poignant piece is a testament to how closely linked we are to the world around us and how much we are at its mercy.  In a place like the Gobi Desert, this is never more obvious.  As an archaeologist I appreciated the fact that I was watching history taking place, as the traditions of one generation are passed down to the next.  In a world where history is loosing its foothold, where the traditions and cultures of the past are being forsaken for the sake of profit, it is interesting to see that there is still hope...that such a beautiful story will live on like an archaeological artefact.",1107388800,2,1023,4.365079365079365
