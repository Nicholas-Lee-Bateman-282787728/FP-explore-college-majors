3520647,5,B001CY5N1E,The TV show is fun. It shows a family that is supportive of one another. You can tell the love each other very much. They seem to be a very fun family. It's a good TV show with alot of good laughs.,1230940800,,197,3.7142857142857144
3520648,2,B001CY5N1E,"my wife made me watch the kardashians when it first came out and I admit I liked it right away and we have been watching ever since. naturally we couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd. I couldn't be more disappointed with the dvd because its shown exactly as shown on E. I was looking foward to hearing the exact language and other things they can't show on tv. If I wanted to see it this way, all I have to do is watch the reruns which E shows all the time. I feel like I wasted my money on it!",1230681600,25,497,3.8349514563106797
3520649,4,B001CY5N1E,"Ok, a guilty pleasure.

I got into watching the show when it came on.

Course, you have only a short season of 8 episodes.

A down side-EPISODES AS THEY AIRED ON E!  THEY SHOW BE UNCUT.

Ok extras-1 extra program & episode commentary by the older sisters.

I will purchase season 2 when it is released & will watch the 3rd season when aired spring of 2009.

Yes, I guilty pleasure I would say I watch.",1228867200,,401,4.197368421052632
3520650,4,B001CY5N1E,"Although they don't always get along - hey, what family does? - this is a family that genuinely loves each other. And they're fun to watch. Kimberly is hot. Her sisters are cute, and Bruce is a hoot!

One note, the extra episode ""Junk in the Trunk"", which aired at the end of Season 2, is slightly different here than what aired on E!. There are a couple of added segments, but there are also a couple of missing ones too, like the prank the brother plays with his girlfiend on his mom, and Kourtney surprising Khloe w/ info on her acting class partner. Wonder why the changes were made.",1224028800,12,587,4.336363636363636
3520651,5,B001CY5N1E,"This is another of those programms that hook you in and you cannot look away.  I don't know how I get myself into these things, but this one is fun and light and addictive.
Kim is really only famous for being a friend (ex?) of Paris Hilton and I don't know what else for ... however, now with this show, she's getting more recognition (even though she's off DWTS).  This show focuses mainly on her, and then her other K sisters Kourtney and Khloe.  They are actually a very likeable family and not quite as ditzy as you'd think.  This is only a short season, but you get a good idea about their life and I can't wait to see season 2.
This is the way this season pans out.
1 - I'M WATCHING YOU - The family throws an anniversary party for Mom and Dad, while Kim talks about her s.x tape on the Tyra show.
2 - MANAGING MOM - Kris hires a nanny to help around the house, while Kim contemplates firing her mom as her manager.
3 - BRODY IN THE HOUSE - Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Frances gets the Kardashian gals to model his new bikini line, while Brody Jenner babysits the kids.
4 - BIRTHDAY SUIT - Kim bares her bootylicious body for a Playboy spread.
5 - REMEMBERING DAD - As the anniversary of her dad's death approaches, Khloe stars to spiral out of control.
6 - YOU ARE SO PREGNANT DUDE - The girls set out for Sin City.  Kourtney gets the results of a pregnancy test.
7 - HELPING HAND - The family takes in a homeless man, and Rob goes on a date with a Playboy Playmate.
8 - THE PRICE OF FAME - Another s.x scandal rocks the Kardashian household.
While these girls aren't the ideal role models for kids out there, if you treat this as fluff and not the way you'd like to live your life, then this show is fine.  I enjoy it purely for the entertainment factor and as I said, the family as a whole is likeable.  I love their quaint house and the love you see that they all share.  It's a great escapism show and I really like it.",1224028800,24,1930,4.087301587301587

Kendall and Kylie are precious in the first show as they start out as young girls and as the show progresses you see them grow right before your eyes, now they are famous. I only have the first 3 seasons and Kourtney and Khloe take Miami. Just received it today, have already watched it.
They also include a DVD with Kim getting married. If you buy any of the Kardashian seasons the first is a must. Not forgetting to mention Kris Jenner. She is something else. A true Scorpio.",1436832000,,750,4.1438356164383565

For the most part, the Kardashians are a highly relatable family - who just so happen to have a daughter (Kim) who found fame through being seen with ""the right people."" For all of you who have negative opinions of the Kardashians but haven't seen their show, I highly recommend you see this. You just might change your mind. :)",1386547200,,611,4.321739130434783

3520718,3,B001CY5N1E,"Pretty awful, and I watched every single one during a recent heatwave we had here in Maryland.  Blame it on my brain being fried, blame it on my being part Armenian, blame it on...okay, I've always been pretentious and haughty and now I'm down in the dirt with the other reality show watchers!

Kim Kardashian, self-styled celebrity-for-being-a-celebrity, daughter of O.J. Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian (wasn't he the one who sped away with the bloody bag of clothing??)is the centerpiece of this ""family"" reality show, along with sisters Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall, Kylie, and brother Rob.  Mother Kris, a ruthlessly ambitious ""stage"" mother who takes 10% of her daughter's earnings, promotes the beautiful Kim's career - everything from a Playboy centerfold to the Indianapolis 500 -- any opportunity to showcase the exotic beauty and her plastic surgery.  The other two daughters form a sort of Greek chorus as they fight, curse (omg the language, but the demographic for this will not be shocked), have some fake ""crisis"", then bond as a family.

You have to feel sorry for Bruce Jenner, Kris' second husband.  No matter what he thinks, Kris and the girls do the opposite.  There is a big pretense in the family that his opinion counts (""Don't tell Bruce!"" Khloe begs after getting a DUI), but really they could care less what Bruce thinks.  He has obviously given up, throws his hands up in the air, and runs errands for the family.  What a thing to happen to an Olympic athlete.

You despise them, and you despise yourself, but it's like eating bad junk food -- you can't stop.  And if you're part Armenian, you shake your head and say, well, at least they've put Armenians on the map.  But is this how we want people to think of us(yes, I'm smiling as I write this).

At least the girls get behind some good causes and Kim has tried to promote the recognition of the Armenian holocaust as such.  She's a better ""celebrity"" than Paris Hilton, and I'm sure I'll watch Season 2 as well!",1307577600,3,1991,4.75
3520719,1,B001CY5N1E,"Q: Do you know what happens when you're home alone with the flu, and the DVD player is broken?
A: You end up watching stuff like ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians.""

And&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keeping-Up-with-the-Kardashians-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001CY5N1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keeping Up with the Kardashians: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;is best appreciated when your brain is soaked with Nyquil. This reality show chronicles the daily lives of the famous-for-being-famous Kardashians, but it's so painfully contrived and scripted that it feels like a really dull sitcom, starring a really creepy family.

So, the family in question involves sex-tape socialite Kim Kardashian and her equally vapid sisters Kourtney and Khloe, her creepy brother Robert (who comments on ""hot"" nude pictures of his own sister... eww!), flaky younger half-sisters Kylie and Kendalls, freaky stage-mom Kris (who pressures her daughter into a nude Playboy shoot), and Kris' long-suffering husband Bruce Jenner.

So as the series goes on, they deal with sexy nannies, photo shoots (both Girls Gone Wild and Playboy), Kris' defects as a manager, Khloe getting arrested for a DUI on the anniversary of her father's death, makeovers for the homeless, puppies, a pregnancy scare, a near-wedding in Vegas, and a FBI investigation into Kourtney's leaked sex photos.

""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" is allegedly a reality show, but I'm not really sure about that. It's painfully and obviously clear that everything in this show is scripted, without a single moment of spontaneity. Even worse, it's BORING -- most of it is about the family hanging around complaining, posing sexily, or partying.

Plus, every episode has a crisis that is tidily resolved and never referred to again (Khloe's DUI). And they have some kind of moral at the end like ""lying to your spouse is bad,"" ""kindness is good,"" ""driving and driving is bad,"" etc. Is this a sitcom?

It doesn't help that few people in the Jenner/Kardashian family are really likable; you end up feeling sorry for Bruce Jenner for having to deal with this on a daily basis. Kim, Kourtney and Khloe are all vapid, whiny and hopelessly spoiled, and none of them seem to be able to show ANY convincing emotions (Kourtney experiences a pregnancy scare, a near-wedding AND a sex scandal... but never changes expression).

Worst of all is Kris, the reptilian stage-mom -- one hilarious scene has her pretending to cry over her ex-husband's death, dabbing at the corners of her perfectly made-up, dry eyes. Seriously, was the intent to make us hate her? She repeatedly lies to her husband, and constantly tries to sexually peddle her daughters to the public!

""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" is a tedious reality-sitcom that never lets you forget that everything is scripted, especially since none of the Kardashians can act. Pass it by.",1286150400,18,2927,5.417582417582418
3520720,4,B001CY5N1E,"KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS is something shouldn't like [it's obviously scripted, despite being flogged as a fly-on-the-wall show], but I watch anyway.

The Kardashian family are: Mum Kris Jenner, Her husband Bruce [Olympic gold medal winner], Kris' older children; Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloe, Robert [their father is late L.A. power attorney Robert Kardashian] and Kris' and Bruce's daughters Kylie and Kendall.

Most of the episodes center around Kim [she's the one with the T&A and her own best-selling sex tape], although she is actually boring and very me-me-me. She keeping referring to herself as famous, but this is the recording of the first season, she was just known as 'the girl in that sex tape' at this point... Robert is another weak link - he seems nice, but doesn't do anything when he's
onscreen, but luckily he's away in uni most of the time.

What keeps me viewing is Khloe's sense of humour. She is hilarious and whenever she pairs up with Kourtney you know there is bound to be something worth watching about to happen. Khloe is the standout on the show and since she and Kourtney are so good together they now have a spin off show [Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami] too, which often outperforms this show for ratings in the US.

Bruce is also very funny, but he is often drowned out by the girls, which is a shame. Momager Kris is much more likable then I thought she would be and is feisty. Kylie and Kendall don't really get too much screen time, but as they're in their early teens I think Bruce and Kris are being responsible in limiting their exposure.

Episode 1: I'm Watching You
Kim prepares her first big TV interview, where she'll have to discuss her sex tape and everyone helps to set up a anniversary party for Bruce and Kris.

Episode 2: Managing Mom
Being a busy working mum [she owns a store and is manager to Bruce as well as Kim] starts to take it's tole on Kris, so she hires a nanny. Meanwhile Kim debates firing her as her manager.

Episode 3: Brody in the House
As the girls and Rob all go to Mexico for a saucy shoot, Bruce is told that they're taking a vacation. When he finds out that they're doing a shoot for a swimwear range owned by the creator of 'Girls Gone Wild' he goes after them and asks his son Brody Jenner to stay at the family home to look after Kylie and Kendall.

Episode 4: Birthday Suit
Playboy ask Kim to pose for them, much to Bruce's dismay, but as he says ""Why ask for my opinion? You're going to do what you want anyway"". Kim decides to only do it if she doesn't have to take her clothes off, but this is Playboy - do you think they'll be happy with that?

Episode 5: Remembering Dad
As the anniversary of her father's death approaches, a emotionally fragile Khloe is arrested for a DUI. Luckily the camera crew are on hand to recreate the drama. Literally. There's even a disclaimer at the start of the episode disclosing that ""this episode features recreations of actual events"". See? Not scripted at all - pure reality!

Episode 6: You Are So Pregnant, Dude!
Kourtney takes a pregnancy test and there is a wild weekend for the girls [and Rob] in Vegas - will a classy Vegas wedding be involved for one of them? Meanwhile Kris buys Kendall a puppy and instructs her to keep it hidden from poor Bruce, who said no...

Episode 7: Helping Hand
Khloe asks Kris what she should do about the homeless man outside the girls store and is told to show some compassion. So she and Kourtney take him to the family home to clean him up.

Episode 8: The Price of Fame
Kim is devastated when she learns that some old photos she stole and later misplaced of Kourtney as a teenager wind up in the wrong hands. Is Kourtney about to be the next Kardashian 'Superstar'? Kris wastes no time in phoning lawyers and involving the FBI in tracking down the shots of the underage Kourtney.",1283126400,,3836,4.472103004291846
3520721,5,B001CY5N1E,I love watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  I watch it on tv every sunday.  I have never seen it from the beginning. I bought season 1 and 2 at the same time. Can't wait to watch them.,1278460800,,190,3.973684210526316
3520722,2,B001CY5N1E,"The Kardashians are a family of pseudo-celebrities, most of whom seem to believe that they are more celebrity than reality suggests. This show is actually somewhat amusing in its offensiveness. Not South Park or Family Guy offensiveness, mind you; stupid offensiveness. Offensive to the extent that you almost feel your IQ dropping as you watch it.

To go out on a limb, it is probably pretty accurate to suggest that this show was, to some extent, the brainchild of Kris Jenner, the ""mom"" of the family who also prides herself in being her daughter's manager. If ever there was a human being who needs to live vicariously through her family, it is Kris Jenner. Her behavior, whether scripted or not, is inappropriate for someone her age (or, for that matter, any age). Her husband, Bruce Jenner, seems to be along for the ride, expressing more conservative views, but still clearly satisfied by the pseudo-celebrity fame this show brings him. Interestingly, Bruce is the closest thing to a real celebrity in this show thanks to an Olympic win several years ago.

The real reason to watch Kardashians is because of the three older daughters. If you could bottle up shallowness and compress it into a trilogy of people, these three are it. They all come off as thinking that they are indeed celebrities when the reality is totally different. Kim is known because of a ""leaked"" sex tape a few years ago, and her sisters are known because of this show at best.

As for the DVD, the product presents no more than what is seen on E!. It contains the censored broadcast version of the show, and offers little in the way of extras. Even if you turn your brain off for a few hours, Keeping Up with the Kardashians is still mired in the disgusting and shallow lifestyle it glamorizes, and for that reason, the show (and this DVD) suffers.",1273449600,18,1829,4.691588785046729
3520723,4,B001CY5N1E,"I'll admit it, I'm a bit addicted to this show. It's funny and very entertaining. The Kardashian sisters are lovable and goofy, their mom Kris is just as funny, their brother Rob is adorably handsome, their little sisters Kendell and Kylie and hilarious and step dad Bruce...well he's Bruce, but even he has his funny moments. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I would've loved it to see it uncensored and have more extras. I would've loved to see new behind the scene interviews with the family, and maybe talk about how the show came about and maybe more outtakes from the show, but other than that it's still worth the money..",1264118400,,642,4.543103448275862

As a regular Amazon customer I was surprised to receive my KUWTK season 1 dvd and find that it will not play on any on my dvd players.

Especially Khloe! I like that it talks about a family and shows how they great they are together even if they are fighting or joking around, it shows that family is very important. This show always cheers me up!!",1252713600,,389,4.27027027027027

3520728,5,B001CY5N1E,this show is one of the hottest shows on E! beside kim being really hot kendal is probably the hottest of the show and who wouldnt want to make love to her and even that cover for their first season is a little suggestive. if you want a really hot show to watch watch this and all of the episodes on this show are cool and keeps you wanting more so im saying this is a first class show for everyone,1244332800,,398,3.925925925925926

I bought the DVD recently and since I have been home from work after knee surgery I have been watching it. I was watching some of the commentaries and they are just as funny as the show. I would highly recommend this DVD. They are funny and pretty down to earth for having lots of cash. They really seem to be a tight knit family too, rare these days. But if you are looking for some entertainment to escape every day life and problems, Keeping Up With The Kardashians is it. Can't wait for season 2!",1232755200,2,670,4.161538461538462

8290406,3,B001CY5N1E,"It's bittersweet to see how this show began, it was seemingly just a fairly normal family with a few of the participants (mom and second daughter) who seemed extraordinarily publicity hungry and media-savvy, and how they managed to become a mega-brand. I watched because I was curious about Bruce, to be honest. One of my life-long closest friends went through his, now her, experience, and I guess I wanted to try to see if there were signs, to try to understand. You could see pretty clearly that Kendall was going to grow up to become a beautiful, super-model worthy star, and that Bruce was treated like an afterthought even though he was actually the only one who had genuinely achieved anything of consequence, and that achievement was phenomenal. Otherwise, I think it would have been difficult to predict what the rest would go on to become. These early days were kind of sad to watch, really. The beginning of Scott and Kortney's relationship, Bruce being the protective and loving father. The rest, I won't comment on, it is what it is.",1520467200,,1046,4.7845303867403315
