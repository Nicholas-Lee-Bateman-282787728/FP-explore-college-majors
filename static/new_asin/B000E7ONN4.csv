8106947,1,B000E7ONN4,"""In the year 2889"" is the worse, I like the original with Richard Denning(Governor of the Original Hawaii Five 0),
and Michael""Touch""Connors(Mannix).  ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" is just so low budget it is silly!!",1362873600,,221,5.314285714285714
8106948,2,B000E7ONN4,"IN THE YEAR 2889 is a post-apocalyptic, sci-fi epic by schlock-maestro Larry Buchanan. After the nuclear holocaust, an elderly man and his daughter host a group of other survivors in their incredibly well-lit home. This film suffers from being overly talk-y, and from its distinct lack of action (like all Buchanan movies). The true ""horror"" begins when a humanoid mutant -that looks like a man in a melted Ben Franklin mask- arrives on the scene. Expect a lot of dullness, but if you enjoy movies like LAST WOMAN ON EARTH or THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED (the original Roger Corman movie that this one rips off), then this one might not induce coma...",1361059200,2,646,4.725663716814159
8106949,2,B000E7ONN4,"What they mean is that it was recorded on to dvd from whatever garbage source material they had.  It was only ""digitaly transfered"".
  The color was horribly red.  A simple filter to boost the blue and green would have helped.  Also the contrast was wayy over the top.
  I know for a fact that there is a better version of this movie out there because I saw it on cable (possibly encore or turner classic movies?)  a few years ago.
  I only got this for the lovely Quinn Oharra pool scene which I remember quite well.
  Not sure if the grind house dvd that has that other movie on it is a different version or not.  Doubt it.",1338163200,,625,4.194915254237288
8106950,2,B000E7ONN4,"In the Year 2889 should have been called In the Year 1967 because it does not rise beyond the year it was released. The script has more love/sex subplots than a soap opera and holes big enough to drive trucks through. The acting sometimes rises above a B-movie but the script seldom allows much opportunity. Unfortunately, it is not a good, bad sci-fi film or so ridiculous as to be entertaining.

Allegedly, there are some mutant zombies created by radioactive fallout from atomic bombs dropped on Japan. For some unexplained reason the zombies are congregating around a house in the United States. And, just to make things interesting, the zombies cannot live if touched by regular water, especially rain. Somehow they have managed to avoid rain for years or decades until the fateful day at the end of this film.

I doubt you will remember this movie more than two hours after watching and certainly will not have an epiphany from the experience. If I could, I would have given the film 2.5 stars but not 3 stars. It may entertain you but there are many other bad sci-fi films that are far more enjoyable.",1218240000,2,1108,4.676923076923077
