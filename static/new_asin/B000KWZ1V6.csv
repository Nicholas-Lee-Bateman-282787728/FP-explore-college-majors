8159273,3,B000KWZ1V6,"Inspector Conan, the ace detective trapped within the body of a first-grader, solves more difficult cases.  Constrained by the necessity of maintaining the illusion that he is nothing more than an unusually intelligent child, he usually explains his solution to the case by tranquilizing his guardian, Detective Mori, and simulating his voice.  Why doesn't anyone think it strange that they are being addressed by a slumped figure with eyes closed and lips unmoving?  If logical lapses like this bother you, then avoid this series.",1175472000,,531,5.2976190476190474
