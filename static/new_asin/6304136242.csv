789058,4,6304136242,Man this is clasic slasher movie making at work. Mike runs around does tons of damage and kills people. If you like the others this will fit right  in your collection. It's not as scarry as the original but it has great  gore factor.,915840000,,233,4.2727272727272725
789190,3,6304136242,"Although the Halloween series is certainly not my favorite horror franchise, I have to give them credit for being somewhat more ambitious than most. Despite a plethora of failings in front of and behind the camera, The Curse of Michael Myers isn't just an effort to rehash previous movies, nor to add a little bit of visual style and say it's something new. Instead, there is more of an effort to tie together plotlines then pretty much any horror series ever,and to build a new kind of movie echoing but not repeating the previous films.
Yeah, it fails to do most of that. But the mess that's created in it's place is at least an entertaining one that isn't a carbon copy of 30 others",1463875200,,685,4.488

 SPOILER

If you like the end of long chases, Michael finally kills Jamie in the beginning of this movie.
Not saying I wanted her to die, but it was a wonderful conflict that extended beyond two movies, and did not need a big ending with fire works. In fact, it ends in a barn. Not too climatic, but the suit fits.

If you enjoy slasher films and anything with Michael Myers, you should watch this. Minus one star because it has a bit of a cliffhanger ending that leaves much to be desired.",1416528000,,583,4.284403669724771

789624,3,6304136242,"This one is NOT the scariest of the series. In fact it FLOPPED at the box office. Although it was crucial for the explanation of his reasoning to kill his family and was the last movie in which the late Donald Pleasance was in, it wasn't ANYTHING I thought it would be. I get that ""Tommy"" is all grown up and he remembers his past, but the characters are stupid! Who is ""Kara?"" and why is she in this getting slapped by her dad? The score was amazing though: pretty intense music for the running parts. But this film didn't make any sense to me at all. And what's worse, is that Donald Pleasance passed away before finishing it. The beginning begins with ""Jaime"" from Halloween's 4 & 5 having a baby. (It wasn't even Danielle Harris) nor close to looking like her. Then she tells Michael when he catches her, that he can't have the baby. Then so long ""Jaime!"" The only thing that kept me watching this movie was Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasance. I'll tell you one thing though, it's a lot better than ""Resurrection!"" Nevertheless it was a complete failure at the Box Office.",1414800000,,1072,4.41919191919192

789743,3,6304136242,"Why doesn't anyone ever call the police in 90's slashers? They all suffered from this. This movie occurs after Halloween 1,2, 4&5 so Michael has succeeded at multiple killing sprees with high body counts. Government officials would be all over this guy, but instead once again lots of gaps appeared to allow a creepy druid cult to kidnap him and his victim for at least a year. Later when he resurfaces people bring up his name fairly often as being around somewhere, but this doesn't trigger some kind of huge national alert that the most prolific killer ever is once again stalking the streets of doomed old Haddonfield.

I like the cult aspect, as Mikey's perpetual undeath has never been even remotely explained up until this point, besides an offhand reference to Samhain in number two.

I wish I had made this movie. I would have started it with officials attempting to put Michael to death but it obviously does not work. Opponents of the death penalty could then defend Michael, bound up like Hannibal lecter in the courtroom, that continually trying to kill him was cruel and unusual punishment. Mikey would then get life imprisonment while doctors tried unsuccessfully to replicate his regenerative abilities, for which no cause could be found. Eventually he gets out, and the crowd goes wild, he's a national antihero and people dress up as him everywhere, so like in number two false cases and copycats confuse and frustrate attempts to catch him. Then and only then would his eventual presence in Haddonfield start to make sense, it'd be like a mecca for the shrine to Judith Meyers and the other initial victims of Michael.

Instead we get Paul Rudd creepily spying on the nice mom next door. Rudd suspects that Michael will return to kill once again. Once he starts doing so, the mother chooses to trust Rudd despite them both knowing he's a peeping tom. No one ever alerts the authorities about suspicious disappearances, blood trails, a missing baby, a mysterious baby now kept by creepy Paul Rudd, etc. Poor old Loomis is literally standing in front of the police, mutters that he probably knows where the missing baby is, and the police don't follow up on this statement at all.

The mask looks cheap. There are too many strobe effects, especially during killing scenes. The movie suffers from that common sequelitis where one stab instantly kills most people, whereas the first movie excelled at showing that Michael occasionally screwed up his murders and only succeeded out of brute, stupid strength. I miss his breathy grunt noises from the first movie when he killed people, it was a small touch I always found rather unnerving. A head explodes, I did like that.

All in all I do prefer this movie over both 4 and 5 because it at least attempts to tie in a storyline that explains the nature of Michael, but the deaths are mostly due to profound incompetence that was probably mostly due to an inattentive screenplay as well as the infamous reshots and rewrites that are associated with this film. The producer's cut has an interesting scene where Michael is paralyzed by druid stones. Hilarious! 3 stars.",1413676800,,3129,4.8193668528864055

I collected all of them so far but would like to end him and put him out of his misery. This show was better in the beginning and some how has gone astray which is a pity but the suspense is still there and a few more victims again so your time isn't completely wasted. I rated this show an A grade for the acting and storyline so when nothing better on, go for the popcorn gather up the movie and relax with feet up to watch a horror show that has a few surprises around the corner.

But do not buy this Miramax release, it has no extras at all
scream factory/Anchor bay has just released a Halloween blu-ray boxset
one of the Blu-ray's in this boxset is Halloween 6 blu-ray 2 Disc keepcase
which has both the Theatrical version and the never before released Producers cut on blu-ray for the very first time
the producers cut is longer version 95mins
and has extra scenes in it that makes the plot more sense
plus has an 1hour worth of new interviews and a new Audio commentary

this new scream factory/Anchor bay release of Halloween 6, tragically is not available separatly on amazon.com
you have to buy the 15 Disc boxset to get the Halloween 6 blu-ray 2 Disc keepcase

789822,2,6304136242,"I'm one of the people that didn't like this movie. It was a good idea, but the theatrical cut of the movie was poorly done and ruined a chance at reviving the series. It did start off interesting, new characters, a gruesome death, but quickly turned into a movie poorly made. Later characters came out of nowhere, the set up for the villains was poorly explained, Michael being in the movie surved no purpose, the ending sucked and the treatment past characters got sucked.

The producer's cut of the movie is better actually. It made the storyline a lot easier to understand and filled in every plot hole. Dislikes to remain for that cut though. How does a ring of stones stop Michael? Who's the man in black at the end of this cut? What happens after this? and finally, (a problem with both cuts) this doesn't feel right as a straight up sequel to the other movies.

So a flawed movie, but unlike Halloween 5, there are too many flaws for me to ignore nor are there any characters I cared for. Still I'll pick up, as I've seen movies that are far worse then this.",1393459200,,1065,4.401015228426396

Not as bad as PART 8, but nowhere near as good as PARTS 1-5 (yes Season Of The Witch was a good movie) or Part 7, this little turd attempts to explain away the supernatural aspects of Michael (why can't The Shape die?) as well as the reason he needs to kill his family... A mysterious cult known as THORN! WTF? Yeah, apparently before the beginning of the 1st  film, Michael is visited by a damn cult that told him to kill his whole family.

The original (1978) is one of my favorite movies of all time, only rivaled in its genre by Hitchcock. If your interested in this series I would recommend you watch Halloween (1978), Halloween II (1981), Halloween H2o (7) and the first 10 minutes of Halloween Resurrection (8) and call that the story.

The only way to watch it is to get a bootleg copy or watch it online, but both are poor quality, that is why they need to release this on Blu Ray!

They need to come out with a ultimate edition that includes directors cut, producers cut and original on Blu Ray. I know that would sell really good by the Halloween fans.

This film takes place about 7 years after the last film, and somehow Jamie has grown from a 7 year old girl to about 22 years of age in that time. Apparently held hostage by the Thorn cult and I'm guessing she was forcibly impregnated....I don't know and don't want to think about it too long. So as this film starts Jamie is pregnant and ready to give birth. She's being held in a facility run by the Thorn cult who are hoping to use her baby as either a sacrifice to Michael, or maybe as the re-birth of Michael's evil...I don't know, and it's never really made clear.

After giving birth to a baby boy, Jamie escapes with her son thanks to the help of a friendly, but doomed nurse. So Jamie sets off for Haddonfield for some reason, with Michael in hot pursuit. As she's trying to escape her killer uncle she winds up in a deserted bus station.

While all of this is going on, it seems that all of Haddonfield is listening to a single radio station broadcasting a shock jock's radio show. The shock jock is taking calls regarding Michael Myers and an upcoming Halloween bash in Haddonfield. Jamie calls into the show and makes a plea of help to Dr. Loomis, who happens to be listening. Dropping the phone she hits the road again, leading Michael away from her tot, she makes her way to a run down barn full of sharp objects.

The next morning is Halloween, and we discover that a new family of Strodes have moved into the old Myers house. This family seems more dysfunctional than Michael's!! Abusive dad is abusive to his wife, daughter and grandson, and we immediately being waiting for him to die horribly. We also soon find out that Tommy, the little boy Laurie was babysitting in the original film is living across the street and waiting for Michael to come home.....again. He's listening to playback of Jamie's call to the shock jock from the night before and sets out to help her.

Michael soon comes back to ruin another Halloween for Haddonfield, and Thorn is out to make sure his evil walks the Earth with the help of Jamie's baby and a little boy named Danny Strode who seems to also hear the ""voices"" that drove Michael to kill when he was a boy.

The whole film is a convuluted mess, and what started as a simple series about a maniac attacking babysitters now involves Druids, rune stones, and who bunch of stuff that really just adds padding to the run time. There's supposed to be some twists in the story where people you thought were good guys are actually bad guys, and to make matters even more complicated, there's a version of this film floating around out there called ""The Producer's Cut"" which features a completely different ending. (I've seen it, and while it's different...it's still not very good).

Where the Halloween series went off the rails was trying to provide motive for Michael. They should've kept it simple like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B003COE90S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>, fans of these films don't need complicated plots or motives for the killer's actions, just make Michael the masked boogeyman, the Halloween spectre that occasionally appears to cause havoc. This film gets so caught up in trying to provide reasoning to Michael's action, it loses the focus on suspense and horror.

While it is a better film than part 5...that's not really saying much. If you've invested the time in Jamie's storyline with part 4 & 5, then you are kind of forced to endure this one so that you see how everything plays out, just don't expect to be satisfied.

To end on a high note, I have to say that one element of these films that I've always enjoyed is Donald Pleasence. Sure, these movies weren't high art, but Pleasance gave his all to this role (and every role he's ever played). Pleasance added a breath of life into this series, and without his manic Dr. Loomis, I don't know if these films would be remembered as well if he weren't part of them.",1382659200,3,4349,4.898097826086956
789857,1,6304136242,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, is not the worst in the series. Obviously, Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is. But the third one was bad, because it veered away from the actual story. That being, following up in some fashion, with the events that occurred in Halloween 2.

This particular film, which is the sixth in the series, is bad, because it strives to offer an explanation for the actions of Haddonfield  maniac, Michael Myers.  The problem is, the explanation is convoluted and full of historic nonsense, that would require the average Halloween fan, to keep an encyclopedia or smart phone handy, just to understand the supposed reasons Michael Myers has done all that he has done.

This film has a confusing beginning, that is fraught with inconsistencies, to an even muddled middle, to a pathetically stupid ending. If the people behind this film, had created a nationwide contest, asking Halloween fans to come up with a plot for this movie, they would've received more interesting ideas from the public, than what they eventually went with.

The one star I have given this DVD, is for effort. I as a fan, have always wanted to know the WHY of what made Michael Myers tick. Donald Pleasance had always done such an outstanding job as Dr. Sam Loomis. This poor man tried to help a child that had murdered his sister. He did not speak, thus, Dr. Loomis could never really get a 'why' out of him. All Dr. Loomis is left with is this foreboding sense that there is no reaching his patient. That he is dangerous and that he should never be let out into society again.

We have a killer, who we see as a child, commit an act of murder against his older sister on a Halloween night in 1963. But he does not murder his parents. Michael waits until his baby sister, (whom we did not know WAS his sister until the second film) gets to be about the same age as his dead sister, escapes the institution he has been locked in for years and returns to town to kill her.

I had hoped that maybe, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, would have explained the central plot of this series, meaning WHY Michael seemed so focused on killing off family members. But what this film did was add to the confusion. An ancient cult plot is introduced, only to be revealed as some kind of hoax near the end, and replaced with a half baked cloning mini-plot.

Why did a six year old boy murder his teenage older sister? A simple explanation of mental illness would've sufficed, better than what was served up in this movie.",1382572800,,2516,4.526431718061674

789861,3,6304136242,"Halloween six has been dissed repeatably by fans of the series; it took ELEVEN different rewrites to be created. And while the film has factors working against it, I never found it to be that bad.

 One thing I did love was seeing the genuine build up of atmosphere. Suspense and tension were present in certain moments, and the use of shadows went over nicely. The directing has a distinct artistic quality about it, the colors being both beautiful and vivid.

 As another good point, it was interested to see the Strodes again (sort of), and I grew close to Tommy Doyle's fanatic character. He didn't make stupid moves but overall came across as clever. (A nice change). Marianne Hagen was the leading lady and pulled off the job.

 For another pitfall (this one a bigger one), there is the Thorn conspiracy. WTF? I preferred having Myers being evil for no apparent reason; I especially didn't like the theory ending up as some sort of astrological star-alignment, conspiracy, cult crap!

 Thankfully there was another change for the better. Unlike part five, Curse has plenty of the red stuff to distract one from the crappily written dialogue.

 In the end six is somewhat refreshing and not as bad as the vibe it's gathered. It does have weaknesses but also strong points and it's apparent they tried to come across as original, artistic, and creepy. Not as much absense of blood, an actual plot, some cool deaths, and clever characters. While some may have problems with the details, it's apparent they were trying to inject a little more intelligence into the film and somewhat please the fans.

Genetic experiments using Michael Myers' DNA to what, create super soldiers? The producer's cut is much better especially the whole story about Michael's origin and the thorn cult watching over him, preparing one final sacrifice that would end his reign of terror only to be passed on to another.

789900,4,6304136242,"I might be impartial to this movie because it is the very first Halloween movie I saw in theatres. Although I know it's not top notch I've always have a special place in my heart for this movie. First I think this is the first in the series to actually look like it takes place in mid fall. All the other ones had fallen leaves and people wearing sweaters but you had a sense that the movies were filmed during spring and summer. Halloween The Curse Of Michael Myers actually looks cold and dark and that it is actually the day before November 1st. And I actually dig the mask in this movie. It is a hell of a lot better than the one in Halloween 5&4. Michael in this one seems more violent and he is actually angry. Now correct me if I am wrong but I think this is the first in the series where we actually see Michael expressing an emotion and getting angry. So angry that he walks into a O.R. and takes out about a dozen doctors in one brutal stroke. And then he chases our main protagonists down a basement hallway actually running at one point even though I think that might of been a blooper. Which brings me to the title of this review. I was watching this movie back in the day on vhs in the mid 90's and my sister walked into the room at the point where Michael is chasing those people down the hall and she was like ""Who is that fat guy chasing those kids down a hall""? The music in this one is actually great too. The rock riffs of ""The Shape Stalks"" is the best in the series. This movie is my favorite of the Halloween sequels surpassing part 2.

789908,3,6304136242,"This is one of the worst Halloween movies in the series. The shining light is Donald Pleasence. He saves the movie for me. Paul Rudd is the lead and it's strange seeing him doing a horror movie. I think he did alright but was tried to be a carbon copy of Dr. Loomis he needed to play his character a little more original. He plays Tommy Doyle the boy Jamie Lee Curtis babysitted in Halloween. I thought it was a good idea to insert his character in the series. I like that they tried to take the series in a different direction with new ideas.
  The other supporting cast members that stick out to me is Marianne Hagan, Mitch Ryan and JC Brandy. Brandy has the difficult task of replacing Danielle Harris. I thought Brandy did a good job but I think fans preferred Harris in the role she played in the two previous films. Mitch Ryan was great and you can see he relished in the role he was given. Hagan was likable and real. I thought she did a great acting job and was a great Final Girl. Overall it's not the best in the series but worth seeing for Pleasence's final movie as Dr. Loomis. I don't believe it's as bad as people say it is. It's a horror movie not an oscar worthy movie. You do get two Horror icons going head to head for the last time in Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers.

789952,2,6304136242,"I give this thing two stars because it was Donald Pleasence's last film and one of Paul Rudd's first. They were the only thing remotely good about the movie. The rest of it was horrible.

First, the entire cult thing, aside from being beyond stupid created a story that made no sense. They kidnapped Jamie at the end of Halloween 5 and kept her and Michael Myers in Smith's Grove for years. Michael having spent a year trying to kill Jamie just accepts this and lets her live, get pregnant (in the producer's cut there is apparently the suggestion the baby is his. How that was pulled off I have no idea) only to kill her in the first 20 min of this movie. What follows is a totally disjointed mess that makes no sense. This was due in large part that the film tested horribly and they re-shot a lot of footage but by that time Donald Pleasence had passed away so it had to be done around his character.

They had potential with the Tommy Doyle character (who was the kid in the original movie that Laurie Strode was babysitting), but because the rest of the story was so messed up even that fell flat. Ultimately this is a sequel that never should have been made. It is too bad that this is the final film Donald Pleasence appeared in. It would have been a far better thing if he would have had the opportunity to make the cameo appearance the nurse from the first and second films made in Halloween H20(which rightly pretended this film never existed). Unfortunately it was not to be.

Die hard fans will either want this for their collection or stay away from it entirely. For anyone not necessarily a die hard fan of the series, it is really not a good horror movie (although it does follow some of the cliched traditions) and good luck with the plot making any sense.

789981,1,6304136242,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...

I had never seen Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers (1995) until tonight.  I heard all through the years that it is a sub par Halloween movie.  It is.  I found this movie just typical boring, tired Michael Myers going around killing people.  The way Michael Myers goes about his evil deeds from Halloween 4 onward is a far cry from the way he went about things in Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981).  In the first movie from 1978, he was far more interesting and playful than in all the other movies that came after.  Then we come to Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers, and the reason why he's the killer he is........is explained.  Ouch.  I think the boogeyman should remain a complete mystery with no explanation given on anything.

The best part of this movie is Marianne Hagan, the lead actress.  I like her as a person, but that's all this movie has to offer up.  Donald Pleasence's presence adds a little bit as well, but overall the movie just falls totally flat.

It's hard to believe that people generally rate this dry movie much higher than a far superior entry in the Halloween series of movies, Halloween III - Season Of The Witch (1982), starring Tom Atkins, Stacy Nelkin, and Dan O'Herlihy.  Actually, it isn't hard to believe.  Halloween III gets rocks thrown at it simply because it doesn't have tired old Michael in it.  People actually want to see Michael Myers over and over and over and over and over.  But....................................whatever.

789984,3,6304136242,"Although the theatrical version of this film is very creepy and disturbing, it is arguably the worst in the series.  The story has too many plot holes and the idea of Thorn was stupid!  There is by far more gore in this movie than any other Halloween movie(except for the remake.)  Some major plot holes include not telling how Jamie had the baby, and the ""Man in Black"" having some kind of ceremony for Thorn and then later on in the movie it was practically ignored that he was ever associated with Thorn.  Director Joe Chappelle cut out 90% of Donald Pleasence's scenes which was stupid.  Loomis went from having a half hour's worth of time in the movie to five minutes worth.  The acting is decent.  Paul Rudd is a little over the top at times and Marianne Haigen is good until the chase scenes.  Her screams are just so fake when she is being chased by Michael.  I've seen the producers cut and although it's story is more complete, the theatrical cut is much creepier.  The theatrical cut's kills are much better and the last third of the movie with the operating room in the hospital is far creepier than the cult scenes in the producer's cut.  So, I can understand why Joe Chappelle wanted to reshoot half the movie, but some of the cut scenes are critical to the story.  So, if you're a big time fan of Halloween or horror in general, get this film, but if you only want the best of the best in horror, skip over this one.

The only highlights for me from this film are in the title of this review. The Man In Black is revealed to be Dr. Wynn. And it's revealed he has been manipulating Michael the entire time. Tommy, who Laurie babysat in the first film, is now grown up  & has been obsessed with Myers. Wynn kidnaps Jamie and a cult impregnates her. She & her baby are pursued by Michael. She hides the baby, but is eventually killed. However, Tommy hears Jamie's plea for help on the radio, finds her baby and takes him to his home. He takes care of him and names him Steven. Tommy finds Loomis and gets him to help him out with the Michael situation. He lives in a boarding house is run by Mrs. Blankenship, a mysterious old woman. But the family living next door in Myers; house are relatives of the Strode family. Later in the film, Blankenship reveals to Kara that she babysat Michael the night he killed his sister & that Danny hears the ""voice"" telling him to kill just like Michael heard when she was babysitting him the night he killed Judith. This confirms that Danny is to be the next child to be influenced by The Curse Of Thorn, which he revealed to be the motive behind Michael's killings.

Tommy finds out that Michael has been cursed by The Cult Of Thorn, who impregnated Jamie and The Cult Wynn has been involved with. He is the leader of The Cult. He tells Kara that Michael was selected by a cult of people *The Cult Of Thorn) to be under the influence of an ancient rune symbol called Thorn. It was claimed by druid astronomers to be originated from a constellation of stars that appear from time to time on Halloween night. It is an ancient Druid curse that represented a demon that spread sickness and caused destruction. To prevent this, a child from each tribe was chosen to inherit the curse and would offer a blood sacrifice on Halloween night. The curse explains why Michael possesses his superhuman abilities and his immunity from death. The Curse of Thorn required the cursed one (Michael) to sacrifice his entire family to spare their community from events such as plague, drought, sickness and destruction. Michael has The Mark Of Thorn on his wrist, which can be seen a the end Halloween 4 when Jamie touches him before he's shot multiple times by the cops.

At the end, Michael's murderous ways are stopped. And Loomis screams. In the Producer's Cut, it's revealed that he scream because the curse is passed to him by a dying Wynn.

For the reveals of certain things detailed above (which is why I gave it 5 stars), it's a great film as it explores the the reason behind Michael's motive for killing. Aside from that, it's not the best entry in the franchise although The Producer's Cut is better and longer. I say watch The Producer's Cut if you can and if not, then the original to know why Michael kills. I have said why. But it's best to actually see it for yourself.",1330819200,3,3187,4.431740614334471

789989,1,6304136242,"Ok, this review is basically for the version that was included in a Halloween three pack which has Resurrection and H20. I bought the first three movies plus a three pack, all Halloween movies. The first movies are good enough, the second being newer to me and therefore more intense. Halloween 3: Season of the Witch isn't even about Micheal Myers. It was fairly stupid but it was also kinda scary and the lead male actor could actually act.

So ""The Curse"" was the fourth Halloween movie for me. I don't know if it was the fourth movie in the series or just the fourth that I had viewed. Anyway, I barely know what I watched. So Dr. Loomis came back from the DEAD as did Micheal. No explanation for this undeadness was offered in the movie. And really, I LOVED seeing Donald Pleasance but how was the man not dead after the explosion in the hospital?

Ok, so the movie has the brother's family living in Micheal's house. All I remember is the Jamie Lee Curtis character had a dad in real estate. The house was sold by Curtis's father to his brother. The brother in this movie was decent actor but nobody else could act in my opinion. The brother's wife was Kim Darby of ""True Grit"" fame. Man, what a goofy woman she is onscreen and in real life. I recently googled Kim Darby and the woman has been married four or five times. She is very eccentric and strange in real life. Anyway, so there is this girl with a kid...............

There was a cult at the hospital and Micheal Myers was supposed to be returning every now and then to basically kill off some people, the kid yada, yada, yada.

I know this is an awful review. Here I barely know what I am talking about but at the same time I am ripping the movie. All I can say is the movie was just awful to me. It was very hard to follow. The plot line barely made any sense. People were getting killed and I was having trouble knowing who the people were. I don't know if the girl with the kid was the Jamie Lee Curtis Character or what.

If I had this movie on a single dvd I would either throw it away or sell it for 50 cents at the pawn shop. It is not worth having or worrying about. The plot was very poor as was the acting, so no amount of detective sleuth work can redeem the plot of the film. The people who like this movie will be fanatics of the Halloween series. As for me it was a very unpleasant viewing. On the one hand there was graphic violence. On the other hand even the violence could barely keep me awake.

The redeeming value of this film must be the Micheal character who looks taller and stronger in this movie. He is more of a bad ass than he was in the previous films. In the previous films we knew Micheal was SICK and evil. In this movie we see Micheal more as a sadistic killer than a sick mental patient. Micheal doesn't seem to be some dark evil presence in this film. Micheal seems more like a sadistic killer than some sick man handing out vengeance.",1327104000,2,2935,4.222816399286987

Plot: 15 year old Jamie Lloyd has been supposedly held captive by an evil force (The man in black) since part five ended in 1989 and now she is giving birth too a child but at the hospital where she has been kept soon falls victim to murderous Michael Myers Jamie hides her newborn and is killed by being impaled on a corn thresher! Now Laurie's family the Strode's unknowingly have moved into Michael's old abandoned house and the ""Man and Black"" has them on Michael's target list! Now Tommy Doyle (one of the kids Laurie babysat in part one) and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance ""His last Halloween movie"") must save Jamie's child (Whom has been named Steven) and the Strode's before Michael kills them all and proves once and for all that Evil will always come home!

Review: With its $5 million budget Joe Chappelle ends up being a jerk to everyone on set and edit out the Dr. Loomis parts of the movie as much as he could because he thought they were boring.... The film itself was pretty disturbing and not that good I however will definitely say that it is not as bad as Halloween Resurrection! Now I will admit that I haven't seen the producers cut nor do I want to... I think no matter what you do the film will mess up.... the series went downhill right when the end scene started in Halloween 5! Terror has screwed up. Now I will admit that the deaths are probably the goriest of the series to date but some are just too farfetched! This film made $15 million which is quite the success and I think it should've flopped. Hell, even the story is confusing yet disturbing and it had all the wrong atmosphere and directing!

Acting: It would've been better if he kept that extra time of Doctor Loomis talking but they cut that out as I said before because Joe Chappelle thought they were boring! The acting was decent, acceptable at best but I do wish Danielle Harris should've reprised the role... only if she liked the script and was paid properly!

Gore: grisly, graphic, gruesome, and grotesque gore scenes... We get crushed heads, bloody impalements, a shocking exploded head, splatter/squirty stabbings, a head gets impaled on a clothe rack, and lots more!

Bottom Line: Disgusting take on a sequel that will never live up to any of the others but it will outdo part eight on my scale of one to five!

Rated: R for strong horror violence, and some sexuality

Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 4

790025,4,6304136242,"I've been a Halloween fan since the original in '78. For myself, the first and second are the best in the series. What comes after that is typically where the debate starts. For myself, Halloween 6 is second only to H20 in that secondary pack. The story is properly eerie if not a little disjointed. The cast is for the most part fun and engaging. Michael has a nice mask on him again. Which is a relief after the Jimmy Durante mask worn in Halloween 5 (referencing the huge nose for those unfamiliar with Durante). The cinematography is so rich and engaging, you want to run out and jump in a pile of leaves after watching this film. So the Halloween spirit is alive and well in the look of this picture. The acting is suitable for this style of film. And while there has been the infamous ""director's cut"" floating around proclaiming itself as the 'preferred version', I have to counter and say my preference remains with the official release. I never thought it a good idea to allow Dr. Loomis to be consumed by the evil spirit of Michael Myers, since this turned out to be Donald Pleasence final picture. Leaving it ambiguous was the right way to go. The Blu ray picture is excellent and easily the best I have seen for this entry. Bottom line: If your a fan of this movie, you should get this. And yes...The ""extras"" are missing here. But then again are you buying this for celebs to offer their phoney 'memories' of a film they likely forgot or do you want the movie? I want the movie.",1313452800,6,1491,4.405797101449275
790026,5,6304136242,"This is another film in the Halloween franchise that is hated by most critics and fans. While I agree that all of the Halloween sequels suffer major flaws, they still are (I think) great attempts at making good quality sequels that are fun, entertaining and even scary. This film is another example.

After Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Micheal Myers (1989) bombed at the box office and was even released straight to video outside the United States, six years had passed and the future looked bleak for the series. In 1990, a year after Halloween 5, up and coming writer and long time horror fan Daniel Farrands began meeting with Moustapha Akkad and discussing new ideas for the next installment. He would eventually come up with the plot for this film and after many rumors had been floating around about Quentin Tarantino writing the next installment and John Carpenter returning as director, this was the film that came to be. Production began in late 1994 with Joe Chappelle as director and a new cast including Marianne Hegan and Paul Rudd, J.C. Brandy took on the role of Jamie Lloyd after Danielle Harris was denied. Donald Pleasence returned to play Dr. Loomis. After the film received negative responses from the test screening audiences, the film was rushed back into production and a different ending was added, along with different edits and much more gore. Also, Jamie's death scene was changed (the version that I didn't care for).

All of these changes really hurt the film badly but I still feel that this film is actually quite good, the atmosphere is all there and it includes some of the scariest scenes since Halloween 2 (1981). Of all the films in the series, this one truly captures the look and feel of Halloween. I actually like the Thorn idea, it brings new depth to the series, I loved the Man In Black idea in Halloween 5 and I was glad that it was brought back for this movie and that it was revealed who he really was.

If I had to pick between the theatrical or producer's cut, I would pick the producer's cut but I still enjoy the theatrical version for what it is but it feels a bit out of place from Halloween's 4 and 5, while the producer's cut feels like a true sequel. All in all, this is a good movie, both versions work very well but I can only hope that the producer's cut will be released on DVD someday.",1308873600,3,2343,4.54739336492891
790027,4,6304136242,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers has been one of my favorite of the Halloween film franchise all my life. I think the Thorn story line is a smart and fresh take on the character. It actually links Michael to the recorded history of the day of Halloween and makes it more then just a supernatural guy who only comes out on Halloween. This film has a lot of Friday the 13th movie style kills such as exploding heads and more gore, which are a lot different then most of the Halloween films, but they are a welcome edition to the series. The score is used to perfection. They mix the classic John Carpenter music with a lot of cool flashy sound effects. This was the Michael Myers of the 90s! The atmosphere was probably the best since Halloween 4 and the original. It actually LOOKED like Halloween with all the set decor and colored leaves falling all over the place. I have always loved this particular sequel and always will.

Now, let's talk about this Blu-Ray release. It is a 1080i Hi-Def transfer, and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers has never EVER looked better. I have probably seen this film 200 times since it's initial release in 1995, and I have seen things on the Blu-Ray that I have never seen in the film before. That says something. The sound only offers 2.0 stereo, which will disappoint a lot of home theater owners who want to blast their surround sound systems and enjoy the mayhem. For people like me who use our TVs to hear the sound, it doesn't make a difference. There are no extra features on this Blu-Ray disc. There is a cool moving menu (which only offers ""Play"" and ""Chapters""). I am a sucker for moving menus. Oddly enough the moving menu has the theme song from Resurrection playing.

In conclusion, if you are a fan of this film, you will not be disappointed. The picture looks better then it ever has. The sound is fine, but just don't expect surround sound. I enjoyed the experience of viewing this disc. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does not offer any extra features, but the picture quality alone deserves four stars not to mention this being one of the best sequels in the franchise.",1306022400,10,2156,4.469543147208122

1. Avoid this release like the plague. This Blu-ray Disc only has the movie and nothing else. LITERALLY! No subtitles, no trailer, no anything.

2. The picture is subpar for a high-definition transfer. Not to mention, it's not in the original aspect ratio. H20 was filmed in 1.85.1 This version's ratio was changed to 1.78.1.

3. The audio is pathetic. You don't even get surround sound. You get a pitiful DTS 2.0 Stereo track. The DVD at least offered us a 5.1 mix. I thought Blu-ray Disc was supposed to be an upgrade from DVD?

Save your money and avoid this title. Echo Bridge has a reputation for butchering films and they did themselves justice with this one.

790061,3,6304136242,"""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" might also be known to you as Halloween 6, being that it is the 6th film in the franchise and the 5th in the line of stories about the unstoppable killing force named Michael Myers, AKA The Shape, AKA The Boogeyman.  Taking place six years after the events of Halloween 5, we quickly discover from this film that little Jamie and Michael both disappeared after the last one. We also find out that the mysterious stranger in Halloween 5 was part of a very strange, Celtic cult that actually has held Jamie (and Michael) all these years and forced her to give birth to a baby that I assume is supposed to be Michael's, though I don't think the film ever flat out states this. After giving birth, Jamie attempts to escape from the cult with her baby, Michael in hot, angry pursuit. But this film isn't really about Jamie, which is a good thing, since the lovely Danielle Harris was tragically not brought back to enhance this installment. No, this one is about a member of the Strode family, single mother Kara Strode, who is staying with her dysfunctional family in the old Myers house while being spied on by a grown-up Tommy Doyle (a young and less humorous than these days Paul Rudd), who was the little boy Laurie Strode was babysitting in the first film (even though Rudd looks a lot more like the little boy from Halloween 5, which adds some unnecessary confusion). When Tommy, who has been obsessed with unraveling the mysteries of Michael Myers for years, finds himself the sole caretaker of Jamie's newborn baby and the only one who can warn Kara of the dangers of living in Michael's old house, he enlists the help of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), who makes his last stand against Michael here.

And that's the basically pretty weird sixth installment of the Halloween series. Granted, there's a lot of the old Michael stalking and killing shtick, but it's still quite an odd tale in my opinion, because of the weird cult conspiracy reminiscent of Halloween 3 in some ways, because it's hard to take Paul Rudd seriously these days, though he is a delight in his comedic roles, because what happened to the character of Jamie is so weird (and the recasting so disappointing), and  I also STILL don't like it that Michael's mask is not the Shatner mask in most of the sequels. Oh, and instead of seeing Michael go around stalking naughty teenage babysitters, here he stalks and kills a lot of older people, which is just not as interesting. So, this one is weird and lacks a lot of the good stuff of previous films. Still, I like films with dark conspiracy plots (I actually love Halloween 3 for that), and this was a really interesting one and a really interesting explanation for Michael's evil power and drive. Sadly, the film is just very forgettable for some reason, and it's hard not to be put off by the way the great character of Jamie is treated here. Basically, this is probably the most forgettable Halloween film. That's not to say it's not interesting though with some good points, but while I like that it introduced some new elements to the story, it still could have done that while keeping more of the spirit of the previous films than it did, I believe. The DVD is a widescreen presentation with no bonus features, so, nothing great about that. You do have the option of getting it as part of a three pack with H2O and Halloween Resurrection though, which at the moment are the final three films in the franchise, not counting the reboot films by Rob Zombie. Incidentally, word is out that there is a better version of this film, the Producer's Cut, but it is not available on DVD at the moment.

790063,1,6304136242,"So you're probably wondering why I call this film ""infamous."" Well, the story behind the production of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers has almost become a thing of folklore, as it is an example of ""too many hands in the pot"" and conflicts with creative control behind the scenes of the film's production. The previous two films in the franchise, Halloween 4 and Halloween 5, were independent films. However, Dimension Films, a subsidiary of Miramax, which itself is owned by Disney, bought the rights after Halloween 5. So that meant that everything about the film was subject to test screenings and Dimension's final approval.

In Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, we find a 15 year-old Jamie Lloyd (J.C. Brandy), having been held captive by a devious cult since the end of Halloween 5, pregnant and going into labor the night before Halloween. Giving birth to a baby boy, Jamie manages to escape with the infant, but with Michael in close pursuit. Jamie calls into a radio show as a plea for help and hides her son before she is killed by Michael.

Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), psychologically scarred and obsessed with Michael Myers after his encounter with the masked killer in the original film, hears Jamie's call on the radio and finds the baby, determined to protect the child. Tommy now lives in a boarding house across the street from the Myers House, which is occupied by the extended relatives of the Strode family, umaware that they live in Michael Myer's original home and that he is about to return with murderous wrath. But Michael isn't the only one seeking Jamie's baby.

Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was supposed to finally give the audience an explanation for Michael Myers' evil power. Stricken with the ancient Celtic curse of Thorn, Michael must kill everyone in his family as a means of blood sacrifice before the curse can be lifted and then passed on to someone else. After production was completed, the film was screened for test audiences who, according to star Marianne Hagan, ""was made up of mostly 14 year old boys"", responded negatively to the Thorn curse angle. Due to this reaction, Dimension forced extensive edits and copious reshoots, and the film's ending was completely changed to remove as much of the Thorn elements as possible.

The final product is a confusing mess of a film. The Thorn Cult's intentions are never fleshed out. In the original cut of the film, dubbed ""The Producer's Cut"" by fans, the cult sought to help perpetuate the Thorn curse so it can be passed on to someone else, but the final cut never explains what the cult is really after, glossing over a vague insinuation of some kind of genetic experimentation involving Michael's DNA. The paternity of Jamie's baby is never touched upon in the final cut either, though The Producer's Cut affirms through a dream sequence that Michael was the father. It makes one wonder how the cult pulled that off. Was the dream sequence literal and the cult somehow forced Michael to have sex with his own niece, or did they elicit sperm from him and artificially inseminate Jamie instead? How do you sexually arouse someone whose sole desire is to kill? Did they use Viagra to get Michael turned on, or do they just let him watch snuff films or beheading videos to get him all hot and bothered?

This was Donald Pleasence's last film, as he passed away just after initial production completed and before the reshoots commenced. The finale for The Producer's Cut would require Pleasence's character, Dr. Loomis, to appear in future sequels, but his death meant that this wasn't a possibility, so Dr. Loomis has nearly no involvement in the final cut's reshot finale. Noticeably absent from the film is Danielle Harris, who played Jamie Lloyd in Halloween  4 and Halloween 5. Danielle didn't appreciate that her character met a swift demise early in the film, only offering to do the part for more money. However, Danielle and Dimension couldn't agree on how much she would be paid, so she walked away, and J.C. Brandy was cast in her place.

In all, the final version of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is a mess, falling victim to the studio system of test screenings and corporate interference and rendering it nonsensical and muddled. Many people believe The Producer's Cut is the better version of this film, as the story is more coherent than its mangled stepbrother. For those interested, you can purchase this film and you can even find copies of The Producer's Cut on eBay or watch it on YouTube and come to your own conclusion.",1281830400,5,4554,4.801020408163265

790065,2,6304136242,"Ok, well after taking a look at the first 5 Halloween films, this could go either way. Halloween 5 was alittle iffy, but still ok in my opinion but now we look at Halloween 6: Curse of Michael Myers.

Let me just start by saying this is my least favorite Halloween film BY FAR. I hated this movie, and I hate it with a passion. Stupid / boring story, unlikable characters, the film just focuses around stuff that is not important at all!

We open up, seeing that Jamie got PREGNANT by the ""man in black"". Just starting off right there, that is a terrible way to start off a film. We are introduced to Jamie giving birth, and then the man in black takes away the baby, the set of this scene is so ancient and gothic, makes me wanna watched a Roman film!!! Then a nurse helps Jamie escape with a baby with a wannabe climactic escape scene, but it fails. The actress playing Jamie does a terrible job, they should not have killed her off! Yeah, she gets shoved on an electric mowing blade.

Now that we got that terrible stuff out of the beginning of the movie, we meet Donnald Pleasence again at his home, along with Dr. Wynn of the first Halloween film walking into his office. Meanwhile, relatives of The Strode family live in Michaels house, the mother is played by Kim Darby (Better Off Dead, Teen Wolf Too) and the only reason I gave this film 2/5 instead of 1/5 was because of the badass father. He is the only thing worth seeing about this film one bit. Shame he dies the most goriest and best death scene in the film where he explodes!!!

The man in black is explained to be Dr. Wynn, who just talks more about ""the thorn cult"", which takes up the wors epart of the movie.

The plot with Loomis and Tommy (the babysat kid from the first film) explore the bloodline and history of Michael Myers, which is the most boring concept I've ever seen in a movie. I really don't want to get into it too much cause i so strongly hate this movie, but it ends up in some science lab where Michael is thought to be dead, until the worst ending in Halloween film history comes up!

***SPOILERS***

Donnald Pleasense goes back inside the building to ""finish off Michael"", but that fails when we see Michaels mask laying on the ground and hearing Loomis screaming, which was an utter bad, terrible, dickish, f you ending. Why can't Donnald Pleasence be the one, who kills Myers once and FOR ALL!?

So I HATE Halloween 6, and I don't recommend it for anyone. ut now theres just acouple more moments of trash I should share with you.

THE PRODUCERS CUT. I bought a bootleg of it at a horror convention hoping it would be a better version that the terrible theatrical version. At least in the producers cut, Jamie doesn't die, but its actually WORSE because they take more time of the bloodline and history of the damn cult Michael Myers was in!!! The ending was another lump of garbage towards pleasense, where he finds he has ""the thorn"" mark on his wrist. And you know, this was Pleasence's last film before he died, give him some damn respect! And not just have a terrible ending for him in both.

It was okay, but it wasn't that great and was somewhat predictable since a lot of the same sort of action and plot happens again in this movie such as immature teenagers partying, getting high, teenagers having premarital sex, and always having the jerks and the teens who get laid die off, just like all those characters did in the first 5 Halloween installments and just like they always do in your typcial horror flick including all the FRIDAY THE 13TH's, the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's, HELL NIGHT, PROM NIGHT, THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW, etc.; except in this HALLOWEEN sequel Laurie Strode's alcoholic abusive father John Strode(Bradford English)decides to be optimistic by buying the old Myers house and move his family in there since he was never able to get that house sold after being vacant for at least over 30 years since every Haddonfield resident felt the Myers house was haunted ever since Michael Myers killed his sister at age 6 in 1963, but John and his wife(Kara Strode)end up dying off in the middle of this movie and the Myers house blows up into smithereens at the end of the movie while being chased by the relentless Michael Myers(George Wilbur).

This horror flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was still living in the Imperial Valley in my hometown(El Centro,CA)when Halloween VI had it theatrical release in the Fall of 1995.",1253145600,2,1541,4.724907063197026
790090,5,6304136242,"No sequel in the Halloween series has divided fans more than part 6: The Curse of Michael Myers.  You either love it or hate it, but I thought part 6 had everything a Michael Myers movie should have.  It was extremely suspenseful, Michael was arguably in his scariest form, the acting was good for the most part, and it left you wanting more.  When I saw H6 in the theater, I couldn't wait for the sequel to find out what happened.  Unfortunately the producers decided to abandon the whole storyline from parts 4 through 6 in order for Jamie Lee to reprise her role as Lorie Strode in the teen friendly H20.  So we'll never get a proper sequel.

Personally, it's one of my favorite and most watched in the series behind parts 1 and 4.  I just wish we could get a blu-ray release which includes the Producer's cut. I highly recommend adding Curse to your Halloween collection.",1247875200,7,875,4.465408805031447

Sadly though this is the last time you get to see Donald Pleasance as Dr. Samual Loomis which unfortnately he passed away in the early 90s.  In this series, Michael Myers returns after 6 years persumed dead in a fire.  The killings begin again, one by one where he starts off hunting for his niece's baby and then heads back home to Haddonfield where is reign of terror continues.
The horror ends up all the way back to Smith's Grove.
Personally i love all the Halloween movies, and this is one of them that i enjoyed, particluary with Michael's killing (expecially towards the surgeons at Smith Grove) & movements which i find really creepy.
5/5 The saga continues with the return of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the next series in H20.

The True Halloween movies don't have some insane, half mute, little girl who grows up and gets raped by Micheal Myers so that he can have a child to sacrifice to said ""satanic cult""...

790096,4,6304136242,"HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!

  Parts four, five, and six of the ""Halloween"" series are more enjoyable when watched together as a trilogy.  As I said in my reviews of parts four and five, I pretend that all three occur in the bizarre and mysterious world of parallel time.  (This would account for Laurie Strode's death and her daughter Jamie Lloyd.)  Of the three films, part six is the best.

  At the beginning of ""Halloween:  The Curse of Michael Myers,"" the viewer learns that six years have passed since the mysterious stranger massacred about a dozen police officers before blowing up the station.  Jamie and Michael have disappeared and are presumed dead.  Not true.  They are living in a secret underground maze of chambers beneath an industrial complex.  A Druid cult has been holding Jamie captive.  She is approximately fifteen and is giving birth.  With the help of a nurse, she escapes with the baby before they can sacrifice it.  Michael manages to catch Jamie and kill her but not before she hides the baby.  A paranoid, mentally disturbed Tommy Doyle (the little boy that Laurie Strode was babysitting on that fateful Halloween of 1978) manages to find the baby.  He, along with Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), struggles to keep the baby out of the hands of the Druids.  Meanwhile, relatives of Laurie have moved into the old Myers house and Michael begins slaughtering them one by one.

  This film explains the curse that Michael was under when he stabbed his sister to death.  It also explains why, according to the Druid religion, he must kill all survivors of his family.  The body count is relatively high; the massacre in the hospital operating room is shocking.  Throughout the film, there are creative death sequences that are accentuated by that awesome Halloween theme music provided by John Carpenter.

  ""Halloween:  The Curse of Michael Myers"" is reminiscent of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Race with the Devil.""  The viewer learns that Druids are everywhere.  They are watching over and protecting Michael.  You don't know who to trust.  Great acting from handsome  Paul Stephen Rudd who portrays the adrenaline-pumped Tommy Doyle.  Other actors of note include Mitch Ryan as Dr. Terence Wynn; Ryan was the original Burke Devlin on the gothic daytime soap opera ""Dark Shadows.""  Susan Swift is Mary; Swift was excellent as Ivy Templeton in ""Audrey Rose,"" a film dealing with reincarnation.

  Unfortunately, the ending was rather bland and disappointing.  It was left open for another sequel.  However, the next sequel, ""Halloween:  H2O"" does not begin where this one ended.  Laurie Strode is alive and she has a son, not a daughter.  Our brief excursion into the world of parallel time is over.  We will never learn what became of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis in that alternate universe.

  ""Halloween:  The Curse of Michael Myers"" does have enough action and suspense to keep your attention.  It is a must have for fans of holiday slasher fare and the legendary Michael Myers who, like Jason Voorhees, can not be killed.",1225411200,3,3068,4.952662721893491

She has gave birth to a boy whom Michael and the druids wants to kill as she escapes from their wrath, leaving the baby to be orphaned and Jamie to die. The Strode family has moved in the Myers house where they think it's safe until Michael returns to Haddonfield, Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd) whom was one of the survivors in the original ""Halloween"" has grown up as he has an obsession with the history of the Myers family as he joins up with Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) with Kara Strode (Marianne Hagan) to protect the baby and battle against the mysterious man-in-black and Michael Myers.

A disappointing and disjoined sequel that doesn't measure up to most of the sequels especially the much maglined ""Halloween III"", most fans say this is one of the worst Halloween movies ever. The editing is kind of bad and some parts of the film just doesn't make sense, although i hear there's a ""Producer's Cut"" which helps improve on the film including an alternate ending, too bad this was Donald Pleasance final film before he died in 1995 whom was a great actor. The subplot behind Michael is interesting but dumb at the same time behind this movie, it's still preety bad but not as bad as ""Resurrection"".

790159,1,6304136242,Before Dimension got smart with their horror movies they tried to reive the Halloween franchise. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was an already dead horror franchise. The cast here is horrible and the deciison to kill of the charcter of Jamie was stupid. The film does have some decent kills but it lacks some good old fashioned T&A and the plot was all over the place. Skip this one.,1221350400,2,390,4.585714285714285
790160,4,6304136242,"Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers is about a little boy who begins having nightmares and hearing voices of a strange man all dressed in black telling him to commit acts of murder. In the process Michael Myers has returned to the town of Haddonfield, Illinois on a mission of murder perusing his niece. Of course Dr. Loomis is on Myers' tale while a much larger evil is at force.

Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers is one of those films that gets often ridiculed by fans, but that is most unfair. This slasher sequel has a lot more going for it then your most critics and genre fans give it credit for.

First off, you have a little boy, Danny, having nightmares of a man in black telling him to commit acts of murder. Then he begins to see and hear the man in various times and places. Perhaps it is the most horrifying form of terror to feel that your mind is consumed by an external torment. Also, of course the child instead of obeying the commends of the ""voice"" rises up against the voice to not commit acts of murder, but to express his fear in a more positive way such as drawings.

The ""Voice Man"" in many ways makes one thing of an evil type such as Osama Ben Laden or Sadam Hussein. These are the kind of people whom preach evil to others and are blindly followed. Michael is basically a puppet on a string, being controlled by this man, not by words but by dark magic called ""Thorn.""

Then we have a returning character named Tommy Doyle. One would remember him as the little boy in the original Halloween who enjoyed horror movies and popcorn, who was baby sat by Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). His character returns in this installment as an adult who has been severely affected by the traumatic events that he went through as a child. He grows up to be obsessed with the very thing that scared him as a child. I think that is a very powerful metaphor for the very fans of this genre. Often times we see a horror film for the first time as a child, and once that happens we are forever linked to what scared us the most. That is because fear does a lot of things for the mind. It motivates, and once the frightening event is over your mind tries to put the events in the context of some sort of rational thought. Tommy was scared by Michael as a child and spends his whole existence trying to find the reasoning behind Michael's madness, just like the typical horror fan is scared by a film as a child and spends their whole life watching these films trying to find the reason for their obsession. Is the obsession dangerous? No, as long as it is put to positive use and not negative use. Tommy was scared by Michael, but he did not imitate Michael, he rather tried to explain Michael. Being a horror fan has responsibilities. One must watch these film and try to use them in positive ways by being either creative or insightful rather then engage in criminal activity. Tommy Doyle is the perfect metaphor for the horror fan.

At it's core, once the subtext is aside, Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers makes for the perfect popcorn slasher flick. It has a brooding Michael with murder sequences filled with special effects by John Carl Buechler that please any fan of the slasher genre. It has suspenseful stalking and chase scenes and inspired music by Allan Howarth.",1218844800,3,3299,4.401639344262295

790198,3,6304136242,"The Curse of Michael Myers is one of the installments that seems to strike a lot of debates among the fans; some see it as the best sequel and others see it as the worst. Some people liked the back-story that finally gave us a reason behind Michael's motives, while others think it took away all his mystery.  As a series goes on a lot of times a back-story that was never brought up before suddenly comes out, sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. In the case of The Curse of Michael Myers it falls into both categories; unlike other franchises, at least this one sort of ties into the series.

The problem with the back-story is it does take away from Michael's character. People complain about Rob Zombie's back-story in the remake, but at the end of the day, Michael was still a psychopath who was bound to snap sooner or later, The Curse of Michael Myers almost makes him sympathetic in the sense he cannot help himself due to the curse. Zombie's Halloween didn't really give Michael a reason. It showed us a disturbed boy with a terrible home.

In Halloween 5 is when we are introduced to the man in black, and he did serve Halloween 5 well. It added some mystery and the ending made a great cliffhanger. Think back to when you first saw it. Come on you know it was shocking and left you wanting more. But let's face it even if it worked in Halloween 5 it did back the series into a corner and no matter what direction that character went fans were bound to be upset.

Daniel Farrands had the task of having to explain who the man in black was and it wasn't an easy job. Farrands is a fan of the series and it shows in his script. Some of the past makers of the Halloween sequels were fans, but Farrands is one of the die hard fans and a lot of the times when a die hard fan writes for his favorite franchise it normally doesn't work out well.

The screenplay was a very mixed bag; personally I never cared for the curse of thorn and therefore it's tough for me to get into the movie. The thing is I don't believe this was a poorly written movie. While the script isn't great, Farrands' does a pretty good job with the characters. I liked quite a few of them, but overall his screenplay is often quite messy and never fully works out well. In fairness Farrands had to do a lot of rewrites, but any draft I read really wasn't much better. The whole curse of thorn I thought was a bit too much. Granted there weren't many directions to go, but it just doesn't work. Like I said about the only thing that really works well in the script are the characters, but everything else is very sloppy, which isn't only on Daniel Farrands the director and producers had a hand in that, but his script was quite flawed.

One of my major complaints, while it might sound silly, but the fact the Strode family is so oblivious that they live in the Myers house is so idiotic. How can they not know? John Strode obviously knows, but no one else knows. They are living in the Myers house, one would think soon after moving in they would find out. Considering all the people Michael has killed over the years and it's not like it was a cover up. It might be silly, but that bugs the hell out of me.

Joe Chappelle serves as director and delivers a very uneven movie; the problem is this guy didn't have any respect for the series and didn't really care about the movie. His only interest was getting a 3-picture deal with Dimension films and all of that very much shows in the final product. His scenes are mostly sloppy with terrible editing and he never really develops much suspense or tension. Chappelle also added a lot more violence to this installment. The Curse of Michael Myers feels more like a Friday the 13th sequel rather than a Halloween sequel. There is even an exploding head death scene, while the F/X was cool on it that's something that doesn't really fit into a Halloween movie.

There are a couple of fairly decent moments, while none were very suspenseful, but there were some decent moments. Joe Chappelle takes a script that is a bit messy to begin with and further screws things up. John Carpenter himself could have directed The Curse of Michael Myers and it still wouldn't be one of my favorites due to the plot, but I am willing to bet it would still be a scary and suspenseful movie. Joe Chappelle could have come in and salvaged any script problems, but instead he creates more problems. At no time did I really feel and sense of dread or doom and most of the chase scenes fall rather flat. At the end of the day The Curse of Michael Myers really is your standard stalk and slash movie. Like I said there were some decent moments, but as a whole nothing really works. With a better director or at least someone who cared enough I think this could have been better despite the flawed the script. Wouldn't be a great movie, but could have been a lot better.

The final act though does have some decent moments, but still lacks any real tension. Joe Chappelle at times manages to get some scenes right, but as a whole a majority of his scenes just fall flat. He just seemed to be going through the motions and never really tries to do anything too different from your basic stalk and slash movie. Bottom line its obvious making this movie wasn't important and it shows. A lot of the scenes try and attempt at what Carpenter did with the original and it just doesn't work well at all. It seems like a poor mans attempt.

Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was doomed from the start, from various rewrites and a massive re-shoot. I'm sure all the fans know about the re-shoots The Curse of Michael Myers went through; there is an alternate version that features at least 43-minutes of a difference. That version dubbed The Producers Cut does make more sense and is the better screenplay between the two it just doesn't flow right and this is the one time I actually agree with the studios. The theatrical version may have the weaker screenplay, but the movie flows better.

The Producers Cut also used a lot of the original music with some tweaking to it like every sequel. For whatever reason the music was changed in the theatrical release and of all the scores The Curse of Michael Myers has one of the weakest of the series. Alan Howarth who scored the previous sequels and I like what he did, but the score here was mostly terrible. The only time the score works is when it's the original music and not the very annoying guitar take on the music.

The final act also went through some major changes, the original was quite idiotic and Michael was stopped by Runes or as I call them a bunch of rocks. Joe Chappelle wrote the final act though is un-credited. To be totally honest, the final act is about the only thing that works in The Curse of Michael Myers when it comes to suspense and tension. It's not very good, but there is some decent suspense and tension. No this won't have you on the edge of your seat, but it's about the only thing Joe Chappelle gets sort of right.

As I pointed out before the characters weren't too bad, but they were just stuck in a sub-par movie. It was interesting having the Tommy Doyle character brought back this time played by Paul Rudd. Tommy is pretty much a younger version of Loomis. Rudd does a fairly good job, but most of his lines seem to be rewrites of past movies saying things that Dr. Loomis would normally say. And speaking of Dr. Loomis, he's pretty much wasted here. Joe Chappelle didn't really care for the Loomis character and cut a lot of his scenes. Loomis is around early, but after that he doesn't really do much and goes MIA for a while. The final act he's taken out rather early before returning in the final minutes.

I'm a big fan of Donald Pleasence, but in fairness there really weren't many directions the character could go at this point and a lot of his dialogue is mostly a rehash. Pleasence though like always is excellent here. Sadly this was the last movie he did. Shortly after filming he passed away. When the movie was released he had been dead for several months. It doesn't seem like Pleasence was in the best of health at the time, but he's a trooper and gives the role his all. Halloween has never been the same since he passed away.

The brightest spot of The Curse of Michael Myers is Kara Strode played by Marianne Hagan; I thought she made for a strong and excellent heroine and gave a solid performance. She's the main reason I didn't lose complete interest. Only downside is a great character trapped in an average movie. I really liked the character of Kara she doesn't get the respect she deserves due to the movie not really getting over all that well with fans. But she was the bright spot in this movie. Kara was an excellent character and played very well by Marianne Hagan in her screen debut.

One of the biggest complaints about The Curse of Michael Myers is that Danielle Harris didn't reprise the role of Jamie Lloyd she's now played by J.C. Brandy. I think all hardcore fans will tell you Danielle is Jamie, but it didn't work out it happens. Some people bash J.C. Brandy, but she does give a strong performance. She doesn't really have a lot to do besides run away from Michael and she's only in the first 20-minutes of the movie. I didn't like the direction Jamie went. She was a great character and after all she went through it's kinda sad to see her reduced to just some random character. And while I did like J.C. Brandy, but of course I'll favor Danielle, the death scene was brutal and a sad way to see the character go, but it does lack a little bit since it wasn't Danielle. But again J.C. Brandy does well and deserves a lot more credit than she gets.

In closing, The Curse of Michael Myers has some fairly decent moments, brought down by an average script and very weak direction. The overall feel almost looks like a DTV movie. This isn't the worst of the series, but not one of the best, what could have been a some what good movie is brought down by the directing. Hardcore fans will probably find something to like out of this, but it is one of the weaker installments with some decent moments. In my opinion far better than the two movies that followed, but not as good as the remake.",1201219200,5,10226,4.387862796833773

Other than this, the whole ""Michael kills because of a cult,"" is way to cheesy. I think Jason Voorhees being brought back to life by lightening (Friday the 13th, part 6) was more serious than this.

790202,1,6304136242,"In 1995, six years after the disastrous ""Halloween 5"" was released, the sixth film ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" came out. And just like ""Halloween 5"" it's another pitiful entry to a series that's lived long and well. Although this one is just a tad bit better than ""Halloween 5"". Donald Pleasence returns once again as Dr. Loomis, and this time he doesn't overact as badly as he did in the awful fifth movie (it turned out to be the last performance of his long career; Pleasence died shortly after filming was completed and the film is dedicated to him). Once again Michael Myers goes after his niece Jamie Lloyd, who this time is grown up and has given birth to a baby. Now Michael is not only after Jamie, but also her newborn son. And of course he has to return to Haddonfield and starts killing off a family that's foolishly moved into Michael's old house. This movie is just by-the-numbers filmmaking. The director Joe Chappelle, just like the director of ""Halloween 5"", doesn't impress here. The new characters introduced are quite boring (although a character from the original film turns up, Tommy Doyle, who was the boy Laurie Strode babysitted on the night of Halloween in 1978). The actor playing Tommy is Paul Rudd, who has since turned up in a lot of good movies. So this movie didn't ruin his career. But the other young actors who appear will probably never be seen or heard from again (at least I haven't seen them). Another downer about ""Halloween 6"" (which is what it should have been called), the violence here is stronger and more gruesome than ever. For the most part, ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" is a dud. At least the series rebounded with the next film of the series.",1193788800,2,1715,4.6262295081967215

Some of the great things about the film is the score(especially the Producers Cut of the film), the photography, a lot of the acting, and the creepy atmosphere it puts on.  This IS the most brutal of all the other Halloween movies.  I absolutely love seeing Myers kill people in this film.  Im sure that sounds sadistic, but you can root for him sometimes.  I always try to give this film credit and love.  Ive even spent up to $75 on buying Producers Cuts of the film!  Ive always had a soft spot for it.  Definitely one of my favorite films.

After a fairly good installment with 'Halloween part 4 The Return of Michael Myers', they followed it up with, what I thought was the worst Halloween movie ever 'Halloween part 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers'.

Now we have the abysmal 'Halloween part 6'. This movie is not only boring, it doesn't even try to be consistent with it's past sequels. What happened to Dr. Loomis's Scars on his face and hands? Why is Michael so big and brawny now? Why do they change the Shape's mask in every movie? This movie makes Jason X look like an Oscar winner! I have not seen the director's cut, but I doubt extra footage and editing could fix this boring and stupid mess! This almost makes Halloween part 5 look good!",1180742400,3,793,4.431506849315069
790250,3,6304136242,"In 1995, Director Joe Chappelle butchered Daniel Farrands script by putting his artistic vision onto it.  This is the second weakest entry in the series, but it is miles ahead of the crapfest that was Halloween 5.  This entry tried to give Michael a backstory and failed misserably.

Jamie's character has a baby and the thorn cult attempts to put the same evil, the same rage that is in Michael into her baby.  She escapes with the baby, but only the baby survives after Michael chases after her.  Michael then stalks and kills members of a family that are living in his old house all in attempts to either kill or capture Jamie's baby.  So, basically Michael stalks and kills once again.

The backstory which works fine when reading the script doesn't transfer to film well at all.  In fact the whole script itself seems it would work much better as a novel than as a movie.  The acting isn't extraordinary and it isn't horrendous, but it is above average for a part 6.  Marianne Hagen in particular does a fabulous job in the film, seeing that this is her first film.

The film suffers the most from the ending which doesn't play well at all, I haven't met a single person who liked the ending to this film.  The ending just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth and that is in my opinion why this movie failed is that the ending didn't make much sense at all.  The over the top effects don't help matters much either because it gets so over the top you stop believing that this could actually happen to a human.

The dvd promotes the Scream trilogy boxset and Halloween H20, but abosolutely nothing about Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is found in this dvd not even a trailer (a trailer is tagged at the beginning of Halloween: Resurrection before the main menu comes up).

In conclusion, the thing that drags this entry down so much is the crappy direction and the ending.  But the ending is awful enough that I can't recommend this movie to anyone, so this one, like the previous entry is reserved for Halloween die-hards only.

Pros for ""The Curse of Michael Myers"": better pacing; some of The Shape's (George Wilbur's) more intimidating moves are in the ""new"" ending which makes up the last 17 minutes of this version.

Pros for ""The Producer's Cut"": I personally enjoyed the ""origin"" of Michael Myers presented in this version (even though the movie was slow); although I felt really bad about Dr. Loomis' fate at the end, I enjoyed Michael's escape.

Neither origin really adds much to the story line and the end of the theatrical version is pathetic. At the end of The Producer's Cut you may wonder if Michael is off to continue his pranks or is done killing. Guess H20 answered that question...

790321,3,6304136242,"I can safely say this is probably the most hated movie among Halloween fans (don't even get me started about Halloween III). It's true that there are a lot of things wrong with this movie, mainly a sloppy, incoherent plot and ridiculously over exaggerated violence, but there are a few things that save the movie from complete failure, mainly its creepy atmosphere and feeling, and good acting from some of the cast. Like many have stated there is a ""Producer's Cut"" of the movie (for sale on bootleg sites), which I would recommend seeing after you have viewed the theatrical version of the film. For the most part this movie seems sloppily put together and produced, and horribly edited beyond belief, all which hamper the overall viewing experience. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers had a lot of potential to be one of the best sequels the series had seen, but due to the treatment it got before it hit theaters, it has ultimately become one of the biggest disappointments the franchise has put out.

Ok so at the end of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, Mr. Myers has apparently escaped from his prison cell, although we don't know how. Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers, picks up with Jamie, Myers' niece, having been kidnaped by the druid cult ""Thorn"", which impregnated her, apparently so that Michael can sacrifice her baby. With the aid of a nurse, Jamie escapes the hide out and flees for safety with her baby. She is of course stalked by Michael, who chases her to an empty bus station, and then eventually a barn, where ultimately he kills her. However it seems that Jamie no longer has the baby, so Michael is forced to return to Haddonfield in search of it. Enter Tommy Doyle, the kid that Laurie Strode was babysitting on Halloween night in 1978 when Myers went on his first killing spree. Tommy happened to have been listening the night before when Jamie called into a local radio station asking for Dr. Loomis and help, and he traced the call back to the bus station where Jamie made the call from, only to find Jamie's baby hidden away in the station. Also a new set of Strode's has moved into Myers' old home, and Michael takes on a second objective of killing the new inhabitants, along with trying to find the baby.

The cast is alright, considering what they had to live up to. Paul Rudd plays Tommy Doyle very well, exhibiting the emotional problems that Tommy has obviously had since the night Myers first came back to Haddonfield. Kara Strode (Marianne Hagan) is no Jamie Lee Curtis or Danielle Harris as far as heroines are concerned, but she does a decent job of fulfilling her roll. Her son Danny (Mitch Ryan), who is apparenlty having strange visions telling him to kill (which are never fully explained), is a pretty good choice for the child role in the movie, although he comes off pathetic sometimes (but hey he's only a kid). Donald Pleasance (R.I.P) returns for his final performance as Dr. Loomis, and he is pleasure to watch as always, although you can tell that time has taken its toll on him and his acting presence. There are plenty of suspenseful moments, like when Myers is chasing Tommy, Kara and Danny  through the hospital, or when Myers is stalking Jamie at the beginning. Thankfully Myers is back to being the cold , psychotic killer he once was, and he's not crying anymore like he did in Halloween 5. This makes his murders seem to have more anger and emotion behind them than they did in the last movie. The lighting and atmosphere of the film are actually a little haunting, which makes up for some of the mess the movie attempted to do. Without the genuinely creepy feeling you get from watching it, and the decent acting jobs, this movie would have been a total failure.

So now the problems. Of course like everyone has stated time and time again, the plot is a mess. This is mainly because of editing. The original plot was very coherent and had a definite story running behind it. However most of the story and character development got taken out in place of inserting excessive violence, which then presents another problem. The killings are just so ridiculous in this one, sometimes you can't help but laugh (at one point Michael pushes a man's face through the bars of a door!). Nothing is better than when Myers impales John Strode in the basement, and then electrocutes him, until John's head explodes! Also the fact that Myers takes the time to tie the Radio talk show host's body up in a tree using lights after he kills him seems odd to me. Also some of the characters in the movie are just absolutely horrible, or unbearably boring. John Strode is a fine example. He's the typical drunk, abusive father who degrades his family and comes across as a total prick. When you see Myers in the basement with him, you just can't wait for him to be killed. The mother is a terribly spineless character who seems to believe that none of it is happening, and you feel the same way when she meets her end. The BIGGEST flaw in the movie though has got to be the ""druid"" sub theme ruining through the film. Turns out Myers was never a crazy, cold hearted murderer, no he was simply an object of tampering by this supposed druid cult called ""thorn"". This ruins the mystique that was Michael Myers in the first 3 or 4 movies, as now you just see him as some product of evil, not as evil itself (although he is back to being cold and heartless). I have the be honest when I say that when he killed everyone in the druid cult hospital, I couldn't have been happier. The ending is also pretty terrible, as we are lead to believe that little Tommy Doyle could beat Myers senseless with a lead pipe. All these things more than take away from the overall experience of the movie.

In the end this movie is an ""on the fence"" kind of film. I say this because if you've seen the ""Producer's Cut"" then the movie makes much more sense, and actually flows a lot better. However if you've only seen the theatrical version, then you probably won't understand a thing that's going on in this one, especially if you haven't seen any of the older movies. I would recommend hunting down a copy of the Producer's cut in addition to this one, as they are not that expensive. I don't know why Dimension won't wise up and release a DVD with the producer's cut included. As it stands though this movie is severely flawed, and will probably only be a success to diehard faithfulls of the series, or people with a love for excessive violence. If you are new to the Halloween Saga, then start with the first movie, and of course work your way up (and by all means avoid the abomination known as Halloween III). Overall this film had a lot of potential, and if not for the creepy atmosphere and the good performance of some of the actors, it would have been a total flop.

790385,3,6304136242,"I will start with a brief rundown of where I stand. Part 1 will always be a classic. Part 2 is a watchable followup. Part 3 has nothing to do with the series, so no comment. (For the record, I DID like Part 3, but it has nothing to do with the subject at hand.) Part 4 was a vast improvement over part 2, and Part 5 was arguably the best. (Part 5 was my personal favorite, but I understand why most people say Part 1 will always be the best.) Well, onto Part 6 and the subject at hand. It actually starts very well. It offers us a brief recap of the final events of Part 5 so we don't get lost. (Interestingly, Part 6 of 'Friday the 13th' seems to ignore the final moments of Part 5, but we won't go there.) While Parts 4 and 5 appeared a little brighter and more colorful than the 1st 2, the concluding chapter 6 seems to revert back to the darkness of Parts 1 and 2. The start of the movie offers us part of the insight behind Michael's madness, and of course Michael makes an appearance and claims his first victim. We are offered a generous amount of suspense as Jamie (Jamie Lee Curtis' daughter from Part 1 and 2) runs for her life and her child's life. Soon afterwards, we learn that Tommy from Part 1 (now grown up) has had his mind scarred from the events of Part 1, but is learning everything he can about Michael so he can put a stop to the madness once and for all. (Nice way to link the final chapter back to the 1st.) The aged Dr. Loomis is trying to put this whole mess behind him and live the rest of his life in peace, but ofcourse, that is NOT going to happen. Michael's  house is now occupied by Jamie Lee Curtis' step uncle and his family. One merit of this final chapter is that we are given a few channels of suspense. (We know that the family in Michael's house probably has a bleak future; we also are gradually exposed to Tommy's findings which start to reveal the reasoning behind Michael's madness; there are others, but I don't want to risk ruining the movie for you. Sadly, Donald Pleasence was very ill during this movie, and that would explain why he couldn't really have any dramatic confrontations with Michael. But he does have a memorable confrontation with another doctor. (Is this doctor a new character, or did we see him in Part 5?) I don't want to give the answer away. The only major complaint I have is that there are some areas of inconsistency. Apparently, Michael was cooperating with the secret society for some time. (Remember, some years have passed since the end of Part 5.) For a great length of the movie, he helps them accomplish part of their intentions; he apparently comes and goes as he is needed; but eventually there is some sudden and unexplained treason. It's an acceptable conclusion, but it isn't perfect. The final scene can leave us wondering. The best way to conclude is by thanking Donald Pleasence. Thank you for rallying yourself to finish the  series. Enjoy your everlasting peace. And curse the people who defaced your efforts with the 2 FARCES 'H2O' and 'Resurrection!' As if any intelligent person couldn't figure out that this was NOT a typical slasher! What made your series so wonderful was the fact that your benevolent character suffered so much and struggled to keep his own sanity as he tried to stop Michael. For those of you who liked this series, Donald Pleasence did a good job in ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (1977). He was one of the three wise men.

790388,2,6304136242,"This movie was horrible, but had a few good scenes. Still, even the third Halloween movie was better then this one. Don't buy it or waste your time watching it...you'll most likely be dissapointed.",1125792000,,197,4.823529411764706
790389,4,6304136242,"I highly recommend this movie. Its not the best out of all the Halloweens but it is certainly not the worst either. This was Dr. Loomis' last Halloween movie he starred in before he past away. I gave it four stars for the producers cut which has many more interesting scenes that were deleted from the DVD and theaterical version. It answers questions that we may not have been able to figure out from the original movie. Several scenes that are the same lead up to a different scene that shows what really happened. The producers cut has the same scenes as in the DVD version throughout the whole movie except for the final 8-10 minutes of the film.  I thought that was great and I wish this version was released instead of the DVD version they released.  Both endings are completely different and were pretty well done. I have difficulty deciding which ending was better because there are some very  memorable scenes from the DVD version that I liked a lot.

The movie focuses on a family that moved into the Michael's house. Laurie Strode's father's brother, John Strode, now lives there with his family. He bought this house from his brother who couldn't sell it for obvious reasons. His brother adopted Laurie Strode see Halloween 1 for that. In the beginning we see Jamie Lloyd grown up and giving birth to her son and escaping from the Thorn complex. This ""hospital"" has doctors who are part of a cult that want Jamies baby for some reason and have been harboring Michael for all these years. Michael wants to finish off his last living relative including the young baby boy Jamie gave birth to. Paul Rudd plays the role of the grown up Tommy Doyle who has some serious emotional problems every since Halloween 78. This is when he came face to face with Michael while Laurie Strode babysat him. Now he has an unhealthy obsession with Michael and seems to know everything about him. He believes Michael kills in a certain year. This has to do with a Thorn constellation in the stars, interesting I thought. We also finally figure out who the ""the man in black"" is, from Halloween 5. Then there is Kara Strode and her young son Danny who become the focus of the movie and any other family member of hers or non family member standing in Michaels way. The killings in almost every scene are probably the most goriest in the whole Halloween franchise. Dr. Loomis does a great job as Michael psychiatrist although he is not involved that much as he was in Haloween 4 and 5. There are some pretty intense scenes from the beginning to the end that really scared me starting from Jamie Lloyd in the hospital and seeing Michael in certain scenes where he comes out from nowhere were pretty creepy to me. Of course there is the usual nudity between 2 teens. John Carpenters music is back of course which just makes the scenes more scary. Some of the music from the orginal score sound a little different but it is all for the better. I wish there were extras in this movie but they are not. I did find the movie entertaining to watch and it leaves you with a few question as to who this thorn cult really is and what it may or may not have to do with Michael origins.",1125446400,,3164,4.478336221837089

790444,5,6304136242,"In 1995, director Joe Chappelle had directed the sixth installment to the HALLOWEEN franchise entitled: HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS.

  Six years ago, Halloween Night of 1989, Michael Myers once again wrecked havoc in Haddonfield, Illinois, where he tried to kill his nine-year-old niece, Jamie Lloyd, for the second time. But she, again, got away. But once it was settled, something happened: A man in black killed every cop in the station and released Michael. After his release, someone had hidden Michael and Jamie away.

  Now, JAMIE LLOYD (played by J.C. Brandy) is impregnated with the child of the man in black. She has the baby, where the man in black holds a ritual, where the baby, when he reaches the age of six, will become what Michael is now, but the baby was taken by a nurse, interrupting the ritual. She takes the baby back to Jamie and helps her get out. MICHAEL MYERS (again played by George P. Wilbur, who made the appearance in the fourth film) finds the nurse and kills her. Jamie exists the building and gets into a truck and drives off with her baby.

  Back in Haddonfield, Illinois, there is a family now living in the Myers house. This family is the Strode family. JOHN STRODE (played by Bradford English) is the man who bought the house. John's brother is the one who adopted Laurie Strode. John has a son named TIM (played by Keith Bogart) and a daughter named KARA (played by Marianne Hagan). Kara has a son named DANNY (played by Devin Gardner). He has visions of the man in black. Kara checks on Danny and goes back to get ready for bed, while listening to the BARRY SIMS (played by Leo Geter) SHOW. Across the street is a boarding house. Residing there is...TOMMY DOYLE (played by Paul Rudd). Tommy was the one, whom Laurie Strode was baby-sitting that Halloween night back in 1978.

  DR. SAM LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance, in his last starring role) is also listening to the show. He gets a late visitor: TERRANCE WYNN (played by Mitchell Ryan). They talk, but their conversation is interrupted when the next caller on Barry's talk show is...Jamie. She warns that Michael is coming to Haddonfield and asks if Dr. Loomis is out there.

  Jamie drives off again, trying to save herself and her baby. Michael comes up behind her and crashes into her. Jamie is unharmed. She gets out and goes inside a barn. She walks through the barn, quietly, until she steps on something, making a noise. Michael appears behind her and finally kills his niece. He goes out to get the baby, but it turns out that Jamie had purposely left the baby at the bus stop.

  The next morning, Kara and Tim head off to school with BETH (played by Mariah O'Brien), where they attend college. Kara looks at one Danny's drawings that is some sort of representation to Michael

  Kara returns home and finds Tommy with Danny. Tommy has found Jamie's baby and has decided to care for the baby, starting off by naming him Steven. Earlier, Tommy had ran into Dr. Loomis, where the two had set up a meeting, where they can help track down Michael and put an end to him. Tommy takes Kara and Danny back to his house across the street. There, Tommy explains why Michael is doing all this. When he was born, he was taken into a cult and was inflicted with the curse of THORN. The THORN symbol is tattooed to his right wrist. The curse was to have Michael kill his entire family. He has done so, with the exception of his grandnephew...Jamie's son. Tommy then leaves to meet with Dr. Loomis.

  At the fair, where Tommy is on his way to meet Loomis, Tim and Beth are at a party, where Barry Sims will be appearing to help the town of Haddonfield to forget that Michael ever existed, thinking that Michael is dead. Beth and Tim sit up onstage with Barry, but Barry turns out to be more of a chauvinist pig than a radio DJ. They decide to bring the show to the Myers house. Beth and Tim return home, where they have sex.  Tim goes to get a shower. As he steps out, Michael slashes his throat. Beth is still in Kara's room. Kara calls, with Beth answering the phone. Kara pleads with Beth to get her and Tim and out of the house, but Michael appears behind Beth and kills her. Kara then finds Danny running over there. Kara runs over, gets Danny and has a run in with Michael. Tommy and Dr. Loomis arrive at Tommy's where they hear Kara and Danny knocking at the door. They enter the house and try to find the baby. The man in black is with Danny. It turns out that the man in black from this film and the previous film is...Dr. Terrance Wynn.

  Kara and Danny are kidnapped and taken to Wynn's hospital. Dr. Loomis and Tommy arrive at the hospital, where Dr. Loomis talks to Dr. Wynn, but Dr. Loomis is knocked unconscious. Tommy finds Kara, Danny, and the baby, as they witness Michael slaughter every doctor in sight. As Kara and Danny run with the baby, Tommy beats the hell out of Michael with a fat pipe, Michael seems to be unconscious long enough for him and the others to escape. Dr. Loomis helps Kara, Danny, Tommy, and the baby escape, but decides not to go with them. He enters the hospital and finds Michael's mask lying on the floor.

  This sequel was definitely a worthy follow-up and another fright fest. Sadly, Donald Pleasance, the man who has played Dr. Sam Loomis since the first film, had passed away when this film was finished shooting. He was an amazing actor and he will be sadly missed by his true fans. We Love & Miss You, Donald.",1117584000,3,5473,4.464859437751004
790445,1,6304136242,this film is such a mess it had too many story lines coliding together lots and lots of errors to the halloween series plot it did not even feel like a halloween film it kind of felt like a cheap si fi film.  you basically are put back in the town after six years introduced to completley new charecters and the worst part is that they made a thing callled the thorn to try to explain why michael myeres kills but failed. in all the halloween films they never gave the smallest clue about this thorn group only halloween 5(which was the last halloween before this one) gave verry litle hints but even the producers of halloween 5 did not know what it was. thank god three years later they decited to make halloween h20(which was the halloween movie that came after this one)which completley ignored this one and went to the laurie plot line although i wish they did not ignore halloween 4 and halloween 5 but still a good movie.

790446,3,6304136242,"Michael Myers returns in this extremely poorly-directed film where he easily tracks down Jamie Lloyd and then proceeds on to the other members of his family living in the old Myers house.  Lucky for them, though, Tommy Doyle, the kid from the first movie who Laurie Strode babysat, finds Jamie Lloyd's baby and saves the day.  At the end, he physically beats Michael to the ground, but the scene at there still made me laugh because of the fact that it has copied that pattern of Michael leaving the crime scene with no mask before, and it was worse with the person laughing at the end.

Unfortunately, this is Donald Pleasance's last film, due to the sad fact that our Halloween hero died shortly before it was released.  I don't think that Tommy Doyle will come back as a replacement hero, so other than Halloween H2O, the series goes downhill from here.

We figure out the reason Michal kills, which is due to an allignment in the stars, which only appears on Halloween night. There are also these weird government agents, who want a baby, also related to Michael. (You might even be related to Micheal, everyone else is.)

790502,5,6304136242,"Halloween: the curse of Michael Myers takes the series in a very dark direction, and I loved every minute of it. The fact that Michael was taken in by a Paganistic cult, who used the ancient ways of sacrifice according to the festival of samhain (Halloween) is brilliant. I've seen other reviewers say that Michaels killing spree was unexplained up until this movie...I suggest you go back and watch Halloween 1-5 (excluding 3) again. You will see how this movie connecs with them all.

 The biggest disappointment for me was the fact that Danielle Harris did not return as Jamie Lloyd. Other than that, the movie captured the atmosphere of Halloween with its dark imagery, classic music, and frightening revelations about Michaels purpose. This is the last good movie in the series before they went off the wall with H2O (which wasn't THAT bad), and the absolutely horrid embarrasment of Halloween: resurrection.

 Moustapha Akkad, listen to the REAL fans! Tie up the series with the Curse storyline! That is the REAL Michael! His baby lives, and the Halloween story needs a fitting end with one more great movie!!!!

*****************************************************************

The Halloween series has gone through some ups and downs, it seems like the rollercoaster of this series' success is dependent upon what sequence you're on.  We have two good films, then one horrible film.  Unfortunately that means that this film is the bad seed, the lemon, and not even Michael Meyers AND Donald Pleasence could save this movie!

Jamie (J.C. Brandy) is now fully grown, but that hasn't stopped Michael Meyers from still trying to track down and eliminate his bloodline!  Now a mother, Jamie isn't just fighting for her life, she's fighting for her baby's!  When a late night radio show broadcasts a call from a frantic woman at a train station, Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd) from the first film (who's also grown) decides to check it out.  Not only does he find that Jamie is dead, but he finds her baby in the bathroom, alive and well.  Tommy has been trying to find Michael since he lived that tragic Halloween night so many years ago, and now he has vowed to protect this baby.  With the help of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), they try to keep the baby safe as Michael returns to kill the people who now live in his old house.  Will Michael finally complete his task?

Okay, there are so many things wrong with this film that I'm only going to touch on it briefly and generally.  The plot is stretched so thin you couldn't balance a paperclip on it, and that means a lot coming from a huge fan of slasher flicks!  It's hard for us to immediately switch into Jamie being fully grown before she's diced and we now have to give compassion to a baby we don't even care about!  Luckily Tommy Doyle is explaned MUCH better, I think the problem was that they had no reason for Michael to come back so they had him kill the family that now lives in his house (how dumb is that!).  The acting is weak, the death's are pretty mainstream, and there is never any sort of tension that would put me in suspense (either because I don't care if anyone other than Loomis dies in this film or because I've come to expect it from every Halloween movie)!  This was Donald Pleasence's final movie, he died shortly after the movie was shot, and while he does give another great strong performance, it's just not a good movie.  The producer's cut, I hear, cleans up most of the plot and is actually a good movie, but I have no idea what the price is.

The DVD is just your run of the mill DVD, with no special features (something rather new for a Halloween, although the producer's cut and re-shot sequences may have made special features kinda taboo and therefore avoided), although save the extra scenes I don't think I'd want to see them anyway.  This installment was a mistake and unless you know the producer's cut is SO much better that it's worth it, only people who are OBSESSED with having a complete collection (completists, I believe) this movie can definitely be avoided!",1093392000,,3681,4.577743902439025

I think Dr. Loomis should have been in it more considering he died shortly after the completion of this movie. Jamie dying wasn't that bad because she had two movies to herself and this wasn't her series. I liked how in their backyard there were so many clothes hanging that it was kind of like a maze. It was cool when Michael pops out and kills the lady. I guess he wanted his house back. Loomis really can take a punch for an old man. I would say tis was the 3rd best but it should have stopped here. When Donald Plesence died the series should have ended.

790557,3,6304136242,"I haven't seen this movie in ages but I become to appreaciate the good storyline it presents and why killer Michael Myers is so evil. People just trash this film just because they don't understand the story. True, the film ain't perfect. There's typical awkard horror acting and a rather poor job by the director. The film had the ingredients of a solid ""Halloween"" movie but the movie wasn't made right.
The ""Halloween"" franchise is my favorite when comparing against the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series. I'm just fascinated with Michael Myers. It's not just for the gore, but the origins of him and why he's so evil. There's a solid explanation here in this entry. Myers is part of a cult and cursed with a mysterious rune named Thorn. It's hard to understand, but bascially Myers is controlled by the mysterious man in black, Dr. Wynn, I believe. His whole mission in life is to wipe out his whole family for the good of humanity. Maybe Michael Myers is not so bad after all. He's just merely a puppet or scientific guinea pig by the hands of Dr. Wynn. Wynn is the head doctor at the Haddonfield institution. He performed weird DNA expierments on Myers since he killed his sister as a child. The cult Wynn is in creates evil in humans. This storyline makes perfect sense. Unlike the other ""Halloween"" films, this helps explain why Michael Myers had a purpose to kill his sister, Laurie Strode in the original film, and his niece Jamie. He needed to kill his own family by the cult and the curse Thorn.
Another thing I uncovered, I read in Michael Myers' offical movie website which explains Myers' reason to stay alive. Over the years people say why doesn't Michael die? He's human right? He is human. quite surprisingly, and really not a demon in a sense. The curse, Thorn, has an ability to the person or thing, that is cursed, much stronger. It bascially makes Michael stronger and stronger over the years. A real immortality. His growth also increases. Ok, sounds like a sci-fi plot. But it's believable! This explains why he doesn't die. He doesn't live forever though. This is a simple guess, but i think when Michael finishes his mission to kill off his family members, he goes back to normal like us. He probably be free from the cult as well. Ok, sounds confusing. But this is ""Halloween"" movie, a rather muddled one, at that. This entry has the basic crappy cliches and frights. But the story benefits that, even though the movie hardly explains it in context.
Michael Myers is not a dummy. I believe he's a human, but a cursed one in a biblical sense. ""Halloween 6"" is not really the best entry, but the story and the mysterious origins of Michael Myers is finally answered. I just hope the filmmakers will use this storyline in future ""Halloween"" movies, because why waste an intriging and iconic character like Michael Myers?",1074384000,,2864,4.650887573964497
790558,4,6304136242,"If you've read any of my other ""Halloween"" series reviews, you'd know that both this movie, and ""Halloween 5"" are tied with 3  stars. But when I'm asked which I like better, or I look at it myself, this is the movie I always choose. Mostly because of what it could have been. This movie is closer to 4 stars, while ""Halloween 5"" was closer to 3 stars.
There was a six year absence of ""Halloween"" movies between this and the previous ""Halloween 5."" A sequel was originally supposed to be due out in 1990, but due to legal issues, it was postponed. This time, screenwriter, Daniel Farrands, joined the picture, putting forth an exceptional first draft screenplay, that I had the pleasure of reading. The trouble is, if you ever do read the script, and then see the movie, you'll notice many, many differences.
In my opinion, Daniel Farrands' screenplay should have been followed word for word. It would have been a clear 4  star movie if left like that. It was director, Joe Chappelle, who wanted to change things around. The script went through a few more drafts, and the movie was made, although it was not yet the finished version. That lost version is known as the Producer's Cut, to the many fans who have collected a bootleg tape of it, myself included. I count it as a totally different film, and would also have been 4  stars, perhaps the best next to the original in the Michael Myers storyline.
So what's the plot the 6th time around? Well, after the cliffhanger in the ending of ""Halloween 5,"" with the mysterious man wearing black, (who comes into play later during the film) it turns out Jamie Lloyd (now played by J.C. Brandy), probably about 15-years-old now, was kidnapped during that Halloween night, although it's not described how (a deleted scene in the Producer's Cut version does, why it wasn't kept in is beyond me, just ask the director). The movie opens with a ceremonial-like birth scene where Jamie gives birth to a baby on Halloween eve. She manages to escape with the baby, although being stalked by masked-murderer, Michael Myers, and eventually to finish gruesomely in an abandoned barn. Although an interesting twist has found that she has left her baby behind in a restroom, and it later found by Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd, yes from Clueless) who was the boy Laurie Strode babysat for in the original film. Later, Myers returns to Haddonfield to wreak havoc on a family (cousins of the Strode's) who are living in the old Myers house, including new coming actress, Marianne Hagan, who delivers a fine performance. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis, in his final film roll, putting forth his last effort for the series, and boy does he do a good job, although, by then, he was pretty old, and seems a little distant. He's determined Michael has returned once again. Later in the film, we discover the source of Michael's evil, a very plausible reason in my opinion, which has to do with the origins of Halloween, although explained confusingly, and better in the infamous Producer's Cut.
So what are the problems that had this movie drop down? Well, for one, the ending. The Producer's Cut, once again, had a perfect ending that helped in explaining Michael's evil and tied some loose ends in, while also a great last scene which leaves you guessing. It's all in all, a movie I would have been completely satisfied with if it was the final chapter. But director, Joe Chappelle came back for a re-shoot after Donald Pleasance died, in an attempt to shoot a new twenty-minute ending, not at all like the alternate version. It takes the idea of Michael's evil and puts forth a new idea, involving genetic experiments and Michael's DNA. Being a fan, I took time to forth to some conclusions, and realized, it could all be worked out if it wanted to, but it's basically a mess to people who can't see it. But overall, I like the ending for its guilty pleasure feeling, because it is pretty fun and well-crafted, although not that well-written in the dialogue sense.
All in all, this movie could have been much better, but is nevertheless a good movie and entry in the series. It manages to scare and puts forth a nice, creepy, atmosphere, although better in the (I know I'm saying this too much) Producer's Cut version. I'm not really sure what ever will come out of the conclusions this movie made, due to the following sequels ignoring parts 4-6, but I guess that leaves a nice mystery for the fans to figure out.",1073001600,,4442,4.648854961832061

I don't want to get to far into but such bad moves follow.  I have seen the Producer's Cut and I must say that is a much better film.  It is still not the best but makes a lot more sense and is actually enjoyable.  The acting in this movie is okay, I keep thinking, 'Why was this green lit???'

790611,3,6304136242,"Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers is, in my opinion, one of the better Halloween sequels. Many critics and fans of the films in general have denounced this film as the worst Halloween (James Berardinelli, who I normally agree with 100%, called it ""one of the most atrocious films I have ever viewed""). I personally enjoyed this quite a bit.
Both Michael Myers and his niece, Jamie Lloyd, disappeared without a trace shortly after Halloween 5's ending. We begin the film with Jamie desperately trying to escape Michael with her newborn baby. Sadly, Michael catches her and guts her on some farm machinery, but when he returns to her vehicle to claim the child, it isn't there. The hunt begins.
Sure, Michael's just like any other slasher murderer by now, but he's still interesting, and it's actually explained in this sequel why he feels the need to wipe his family off the face of the Earth (and why he's so indestructible). It could be argued that Michael was much more terrifying when we didn't understand why he was hacking people up, but I for one appreciated the exposition in the film.
I can't be bothered to say any more because I'm lazy, but if you're a fan of the Halloween films or just a slasher fan in general, this is recommended.",1070409600,,1249,4.63063063063063

I would not buy it, I would only rent it for the sole purpose that it is Donald Pleasence's last performance. One last thing, they substited real scares for blood and gore. The original was by far, the scariest and it had little to no onscreen violence. I would reccomend Halloween: H20 instead of Halloween 6.

790616,2,6304136242,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers falls flat in the middle of the 1990s, right before Scream would turn the tired genre on its head.  Therefore, it's bankrupt of new ideas and is generally regarded as the worst flick in the series.
On the one hand, we have a desire to bring back old characters with connections to the murderous Myers.  On the other hand, we have a total disregard for scares, suspense, gore and too much focus on a ridiculous plot that I stopped following closely, preferring to just watch the cast get offed.
The sad part is that this took about six years to appear after the fiery chaos of Part 5 where Myers, locked in a police jail, was captured by a mysterious, steel-toe-boot-wearing man.  Unfortunately, we get to find out that whole story line.  Where to begin?
Keep in mind: In Halloween H20 (1998) the producers decided to disregard the events of Halloween 4, 5, and the Curse (the whole Jamie Lloyd storyline).  Wise decision and further proof that Mustapha Akkad is a genius at resurrecting the franchise in the name of the almighty dollar.
It seems that Michael Myers is connected to some ancient Runic / Celtic mumbo jumbo about pure evil, hence the strange markings on his hand in Part 5, blah blah blah.  It took years to come up with this?  It's all a bit of a shame.  The plot is just too complicated for its own good as it tries to explain the origin of Michael Myers and work in all types of angles from previous films.  Here's a case where they go for something different and wind up with a completely muddled work.  We get the neat idea of having Tommy Doyle, the little boy terrorized in the original film, returning as a slightly nutty adult who is obsessed with Myers.  Now, years after Part 5, Michael is back, and naturally, he's returning to Haddonfield to kill off the rest of his family.  And, of course, Dr. Loomis is back, this time lured out of retirement to come back to Smith's Grove Sanitarium.  Had he lived, I'm sure Donald Pleasance would have been in every Halloween since, but alas, this was his swan song.
The plot is a mess.  The movie is a mess.  Michael Myers, played by George Wilbur, looks physically larger than ever, and the mask is easily the worst in the whole series, as if they didn't even bother watching the previous flicks.  Myers also resembles Jason of Friday the 13th fame in this one.  He displays incredible feats of strength and Jason-esque employment of power tools. He rips someone's head nearly completely off, breaks down a steel barred door by using some poor fool's head as a crude battering ram, and goes to town on an entire operating room staff in a sequence mangled by 100 MTV cuts in what looks like strobe lighting complete with jangling music.  Instead of trying to figure out what the heck was going on, I just shook my head and yawned.
Some very long, long sequences of people looking for other people (`Mom, are you there'?) have no payoff.  I think the director thought it was supposed to be suspenseful, but it's plain bad.  And boring!  If you think it doesn't take any talent to make a slasher film, let this film show you that it does, because when you see one that's so bad, you begin to really appreciate the better ones.  Consider Halloween II, by far one of the best in the series, and then look at Curse, which shamelessly tries to ape every Halloween flick before it, right down to the hospital setting.
The gore isn't too bad, but it looks like a good bit of it was cut, particularly the manic operating room massacre.  There is a good Tom Savini-esque exploding head though.  But overall, the film just feels like going through the motions, and while I know it's a slasher, there is none of the style that usually salvages such forays into this old genre from being boring.  Even Part 5 had a nice visual look that felt like Halloween in the Midwest.  This time, it's just cheese, and Alan Howarth's tuned-up score is very hokey.  At one point, in what I expect is some kind of homage to John Carpenter (who wisely stopped having anything to do with this series long ago) there's a complete lift of the famous theme from The Thing (dun dun...dun dun...etc.)
Recommended for Halloween addicts who love hearing Donald Pleasance go on about 'pure evil'.  But you've been warned.
NOTE: There is an unofficial, significantly different 'Producer's Cut' that is floating in bootleg form...somewhere.  The official Halloween movie website has a lot of info on it. There are substantial plot differences, including many scenes that don't appear in the original.  Something tells me that it isn't much of an improvement, and the mere fact that there is a `Producer's Cut' tells you this was a problem plagued production.",1065744000,,4723,4.601431980906921

I feel so bad that this was Donald Pleasence's last movie he got to be in, they barley showed him and he had nothing to do with the plot (if there even was a plot??) at all!

The movie, a dis-jointed plot with a smattering of underdeveloped characters and predictable, often unbelievable scenes, is a failed attempt to explain the origins of Michael Myers.
The film begins with the birth of a child, the last in the Myer's lineage, within the bowels of a hospital in which Michael Myers has been secretly hidden away for 10 years.  The child belongs to Michael's niece, formerly seen in the earlier sequels Halloween 4 and 5.  As the story unfolds, we are to realize that Michael, like this new child, was born as part of a cult that is run by a bunch of aging doctors who are trying to uncover a means to immortality.  Are you lost?  Or disenchanted?  Join the club.
To be fair, there are moments when the sets, color and style of the film is genuinely appealing, but these moments are few and far between.  Largely the characters are difficult to relate to, or so non-dimensional we simply don't care for them.  As a result, the movie uses the lowest thrill tactic of the genre-gore.  In place of building suspense, the film attempts to use graphic violence to induce a thrill...instead, it induces disgust, not at the imagery, but at the lack of the filmmakers imagination.

790795,1,6304136242,"Of all the many horror or slasher series out there, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, is undoubtadly one of the worst and above and beyond the worst of the long running Halloween series.  This sixth film in the series (and first under Dimension/Miramax films) picks up a few years after Halloween 5 as Michael finally catches up with his neice, dispatches her, then hunts her baby.  Then Mike makes his way back to Haddonfield and kills some more.  This time around we see how Michael is part of some kind of cult and it seems as if the story were trying to suggest pieces of Mike's origin and his invulnerability.  All this however is quickly flushed down the commode.  Director Joe Chappelle (who helmed Phantoms and the ridiculously bad Hellraiser: Bloodline under the Alan Smithee name) has crafted the absolute goriest film in the series, and  the gore and kills are mounted up to ridiculous lengths like we've never seen in a Halloween film before.  In any of the previous Halloween films, Michael killed in a fashion unlike Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees (I had to use him as a comparison, sorry..), but the later entires in the series under the Dimension/Miramax label have made him a more grislier killer, and any Halloween fan knows that.  The story is filled with ridiculous plot holes and gigantic leaps of logic, there are no real scares or surprises (the revelation of The Man in Black had me laughing like I was watching a comedy), and looking at poor Donald Pleasence in his final role is almost heartbreaking for any long time fan of his work or the Halloween series.

790887,1,6304136242,"The ""Halloween"" series can best be described as a cinematic tragedy, with the first (and best) movie being tainted by bad sequels. ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers"" is the final nail in the coffin of this mothball-festooned series that should have stopped at part 2.
What is most inexplicable about this, the sixth, installment is that it attempts to inject a story into the outing, running on the false assumption that it would make the movie better. Michael Myers is making up for lost time, killing a fresh group of people in the search for the baby daughter of his niece, whom he murdered at the beginning of the movie. The story links Michael's lineage to the druids, and suggests that his appearance on Halloween night coincides with a special alignment of stars. Not bad, unless you notice that much of the story contradicts what was earlier laid out in parts 1 and 2. The script was written by a fan of the series, and his attempt to explain Michael's motivations only serve as a distraction from the brutal killings. Like ""Friday the 13th"", the ""Halloween"" series has become progressively bloodier. But with that, the quality degenerates over time as well. Here are the three reasons why the Halloween sequels have failed: A) The stories contradict each other. B) The writing becomes more standard slasher fodder with every installment. And C) Michael's mask changes with each movie, and they look goofier every time.  I was a fan of the series, up until part 5.
The DVD is nothing short of unremarkable. Fans hoping to get the much-rumored ""Producer's Cut"" will be sadly disappointed, since this is the theatrical cut. The
DVD features such ""Special Features"" as interactive menus, scene selection, and a widescreen transfer. Other than that, there is nothing. The picture quality is actually very well done, and the sound is kicked up in the transfer. DVD quality is always reliable, even on movies where it is wasted.
Am I being to hard on ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers""? I don't think so. I loved parts 1 and 2 (especially part 1), but after that, it all went downhill. As a longtime fan of horror movies, I am picker than most. But I cannot totally blame the filmmakers, considering what they were left to work with after part 5.

Michael impregnated Jamie to create a final sacrifice. I think he planned to kill Jamie and then the baby.  He tracks down the Strodes, who happen to be living in his former home, thinking that they have the baby since he can't find him after he kills Jamie (by the way, I wonder what Michael would have named the baby), since they would be related to Jamie through Laurie. That's what the call that Mrs. Strode gets saying ""we want the child"" is about.  I'm not sure how the cult kept Michael for so long, but I think that's why he does away with them, possibly avenging himself for their using him. There are holes in the story, such as why the fetuses are shown, but Michael is at his menacing best here and the gore factor is off the charts.

I liked this film...BUT I think the producers went a little overboard when they tried to make the story more complex and understanding when they threw in occultism. Very inaccurate occultism at that. Also this DVD hardly has any extras. That's right... nothing worth your time. Only a little sneak peak... at other films!
However this movie does have it's strong points. In my opinion the acting here is some of the better acting in slasher films. Dr. Loomis appears yet again and always adds a great atmosphere. Speaking of the film's atmosphere, it's dark. Possibly the darkest atmosphere in a Halloween film yet. Also, the soundtrack really shines. The cheesey piano background music has been replaced with something a little more modern, and there is LOTS of gore... though a higher body count would have been nice.

790893,4,6304136242,"Being a movie geek and a horror geek AND a literature major, certain things tend to interest me that would not interest normal people. I watched this film after watching ""Suspiria,"" a classic Italian horror flick, and so I noticed some interesting things that I might not have noticed under different circumstances. Namely: check out the lighting in this film-particularly during the climax, when Michael is slaughtering a room full of cultists who thought he was on their side. The red and blue flashing lights make this scene particularly creepy, and it's difficult to tell who's dead and who's survived until you see the characters running away, chased by Michael. The red lighting in the chase scene is very effective, and it's clear that this director did his homework and knew the effect that proper lighting can have on mood and suspense.
Ok, so we all know that the plot isn't great, and it would have been nice to be able to see the deleted scenes that established the stronger plot. But the lead characters ""the good guys"" are likable (Paul Rudd in particular stands out), and Michael is as frightening as ever. The gore is there, the acting is above average, and the lighting/staging adds to the creepieness of the film. All in all, I was surprised at how good this movie was, especially for a sixth installment. So give this film a break!

790896,2,6304136242,"Okay, so where do you go from Halloween 5?
Unfortunately, someone *cough* Moustapha *cough* Akkad *cough* thought that Halloween: Curse of MM was the right direction to go. Halloween 5 left some unresolved issues hanging, and part 6 tries to answer those questions, which in returns attempts to explain why Michael does what he does.
The flaws with this movie:
-Ultimately, the movie raises even more un-answered questions that Halloween 5 ever had!
-Sound effects are used to try to scare the audience way too often. While this may work the first viewing, repeated viewings show that the sounds are corney and unessary.
-The acting. May Donald Pleasance(?) R.I.P. for sticking by the Halloween series, but other than him and Paul Rudd, most every one else is pretty bad.
-The story itself. One of the reasons I found Halloween terrifying when I originally saw it, was the fact that Myers killed without reason or motive. In Halloween: Curse of MM, the origin/motive behind Myers is corny and rediculous.
The good aspects of Halloween 6:
-Not much. I will give this movie credit for at least trying to do something different in a genre where sequels so often repeat it's processor.
-It's Donald Pleasance's(?) last Tango with Myers. Pleasance is the heart and soul of these movies, and to see him after Myers again is great, but unfortunately, we never see Loomis onscreen with Myers.
Now the DVD:
-The reason I give this DVD 2 stars is souly because of the film itself. The DVD only has a few trailors, and that's about it. This is [not good], because there actually is another cut of Halloween 6, which is often called ""The Producer's Cut"" or ""The Origin of Michael Myers"". Does this cut make it on the DVD? No. In fact, we don't even get to see the scenes that were cut from the alternate version of the film on this DVD. Fans are being burned by this, because we all how DVD's are capable of cramming special features on their discs.
Overall, the movie it'self is pretty dry. While it may be a breath of fresh air to those looking for something different in slasher flicks, its bad script and ending are what ultimately ruins this film. The DVD is an insult, because there is mystery surrounding this flick, and a few DVD bounuses could have helped. But instead, the producers of this DVD thought the fans wouldn't be interested.",1025049600,4,2333,4.692682926829268

This film is a mess of overly gory and ambitious murders, furious MTV style editing, and one of the most contrived subplots ever in motion picture history.
This time around, Michael Myers is being ""controlled"" by some sort of pagan cult (!) and so, in turn, is not the actual murderer of the film. The whole halloween cult plot makes less than no sense, and it ties up none of the numerous loose ends set up in #5. It's kind of sad to see that this was Donald Pleasence's last film. Such a great actor gone to waste. Also, there is no character development set up on the tens and tens of people Michael slaughters his way through, thereby making it plainly predictable as who are the survivors and who are the Michael meat.
The only three things that save this movie are 1) the Halloween theme 2) a fairly realistic image of what a family moving into a new town is like 3) even if he's just a pawn in some hokey conspiracy against trick-or-treaters, Michael is back!

Micheals niece Jamie has been captured by the mysterious ""Men In Black"" druids, she has been impregnated and has a baby. After she has it, a nurse steals the kid from the druids and gives Jamie the baby. She than leads Jamie to exscape, however the nure soon comes to her end when a angry Micheal (beefed up and all; lay of the big macs) lifts her with 1 hand, and drives her head through a convienetly placed spike in the wall. Even with a head start, and extra time while Micheal disposes of the nurse, he catches up with his niece Jamie who justs happens to drive to Haddonfield. (WHY? WHY HADDONFIELD?) Micheal of course uses his great driving skills he some how picked up (he drives better than most females with licenses) and chases Jamie into a barn. Jamie almost makes her exscape again, but she accidently breaks a twig under her foot giving herself away. Micheal than shoves her into a grater and kills her (Finally! Took him 3 freakin' movies!!) he than searchers her truck she stole from a mechanic earlier (who happens to be killed by Myers; breaks his neck with his bare hands) and to no ones surprise the baby is GONE! This is where the movie really starts to [go downhill]...and you thought the first 5 minutes were bad. It's like I was watching a lesser Jamie Lee in part 1, we had the stair incident, except Micheal falls, and the same chase sceen where the door is locked. What really makes this movie horrible is the sub-plots. Druids, baby's,Tommy Doyle, this other kid, his mom, a angry father ... alot of sub-plots. Not to mention, the whole movie you see the killer. No surrpise killings. Its like you see it coming because YOU ACTUALLY SEE HIM IN THE BACKGROUND! NO POP-UPS, NO UNEXSPECTED KILLINGS! However I will say Wilbur, although hefty in the gut, played Myers perfectly for this film. Unlike the other films, where he was a stealthy, cunning killer..this plot was for a PSYCO, OUT OF CONTROL MANIAC! And it made for a scary Myers. By far, I was more scared of this Micheal than any others. He was bigger, meaner and faster. And also unlike others (except part 5 which [was] even worse than this one) he would even go out of his way just to kill. In part 1 it was just get Laurie, people bumped into him in part 1 and he just let them walk away, same with part 2. In this one, if you were within a mile..you were killed! He truely was a NUT in this film. But because it stretch so far from the normal Halloween plots, it was a horrible movie. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) was mis-used because of ill-ness and it was really sad to see him in such shape. Honestly, Id rather not have had him in this film because they showed him no respect, they left a legend in a film just to say he was in it, to put his name on the bill. They have him horrible lines, and no air time. Only good thing about this movie is the scary Myers, no other Halloween besides part 1 and 2 left me kinda scared. Honestly, after watching this one I still look behind my back everynow and then...lol......he is really scary. To bad the plot stinks, and even a extra scary Myers couldn't save this film. 2 stars is what it gets, 1 for the scary Myers and the other for a tribute to Donald Pleasence..god bless!",1018483200,,3281,4.336585365853659

There is a more complete ""Producer's Cut"" around, but as of this writing it hasn't seen the light of day. I think introducing the subplot with the Druids was a big mistake, as it undermines John Carpenter's original vision of Michael Myers as a ""blank slate"", whose motives and reasons are known only to him.

The movie realized that the series was getting pretty dull by part 5, so it adds a lot of new plot twists, like Michael being involved in some cult called ""Thorn"" that makes one person kill every member of his family.  You'll also find out in this one who the Man In Black really is (I'll give you a hint, he was in ONE scene from the original).
The movie begins with Jamie Lloyd (no longer Danniele Harris, but J.C. Brandy) having a baby, which is then stolen by the man in black, who is going to make this baby Michael's sacrifice.  However, a kind woman working there helps Jamie escape with her baby.  This woman then meets her fate, impaled to a coat hanger by Michael Myers, who is now stronger and more enraged than ever!!  Jamie does get away, and hides her baby at a bus depot, before she, to, meets her maker.  Then, we go on to meet Kara Strode (Marriene Hagan) and her family.  She's got a seven year old boy.  She's going to college to make up for her past mistakes.  Her father, John, dosn't approve of her staying at his place, where he already has two other people living, his wife, and his son, John (Bradford English).  John Strode is an abusive alcoholic, who mistreats his entire family.  Kara is a little bit creeped out by this man who's staring at her out his window.  Well, this man happens to be Tommy Doyle (Paul Steven Rudd), who was being babysat by Laurie Strode when Myers attacked in 1978.  He's a little messed up by this particular incident, and he thinks that Michael's returning.  He was also listening to this particular radio show the night before, and recorded when Jamie screamed ""Help Me"" to the show.  He tracks the area she was calling from down to the bus depot, where he finds her baby.  Meanwhile, Kara is being stalked by Michael, but doesn't realize it.  And, to make things worse, her little son is hearing a voice that says ""Kill For Me"".  Who's going to survive THIS Halloween?  Watch and see.
Halloween The Curse Of Michael Myers is a very underrated Halloween film.  It is propably (aside from Part 3) the least popular of the series, but I can't understand why.  My least favorite film is actually Part 4.  This movie is great, it's scary, funny, shocking, gory, mysterious.  Everything to make a perfect horror film (including suspense).  Yes, it's very hard to make to much sense of it, but that's what makes it  more intelligent.  And there is so much gore!  I know Part 1 is famous for being almost completely bloodless, but blood was needed at this point.  It's definetly the most extremly graphic of the whole series.  But still, it's got a plot, and a fine plot, I must say.  The Myers mask is back to normal, as is his house (where the Strode family is living).  The man behind the mask this time, George P. Wilbur (Michael in Part 4), is far superior to that guy, Donald Shank, who played him in the fifth one.  But, then, in H2O, the man behind the mak is HORRIBLE!!  And YOU CAN SEE HIS EYES!!!  But in this, you can't see Michael's eyes, and he's played eerily.  Nice job Mr. Wilbur!
As for this DVD, well, it's OK.  No special features (aside from sneak peek trailers for H2O and the Scream Box Set), but it's presented in widescreen, and has nice, clear picture.  I'm dieing to see that Producer's Cut, which is apparentally almost a different film.  It'd be awesome to release a DVD with both versions on it, but for now, this one's OK.  If I were you, though, I'd wait a little bit, and I'm sure they'll release the producer's cut.

Sadly deficient in any worthwhile characters, all people you see are either stabbing-bag, or stabbing-bags-to-be. The angry father, nice mother and exiled daughter is so terrible clich is hurt to watch. There are some redeeming characters, but it is so obvious they're going through tired motions.
The setting and mood was excellent. John Carpenter should be extremely proud of his little piano notes. They keep you attentive. The film feels as though it as an artificial gloss, and it is distracting. But it looks nice. The blood and deaths are real, except the electrocution. There is no original-feeling music
The whole movie left me with a terrible sour taste in my mouth. I felt used.

HALLOWEEN 6: THE CURSE OF MICHEAL MYERS is one of the finest and scariest HALLOWEEN movies in the series. Director Joe Chappelle creates moments of intense suspense and drenches the movie with haunting atmosphere. The script also introduces some very intresting and fun characters such as Tommy Doyle, Kara Strode, and of course the return of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence in his final role). Viewers who are not familiar with HALLOWEEN 4 and 5 may find this movie a little confusing, so I do suggest watching the previous sequels first. H6 has a few plot holes, but nothing that can't be forgiven. If you get a chance, try and find the Producer's Cut bootleg which explains a lot more. But I do recommend this movie to people looking for good scares and a quality sequel.

The film seemed to be jumpy in the storyline and trys to be bigger than it is.  The chracters seemed like we supposed to know them, but the one we do know gets little screen time, Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis.  The movie is much more slasher than the origanial it is based on.  Only the people who want to view the complete series or need a quick bloodly movie buy this one.  To me, it seems like it is a follow up to a recent movie that was a cliffhanger.  The preceeding flim, however, came out about six years before, and the age of Jamie Lloyde would suggest an even greater gap.  The plot is that Micheal Myers must kill the last surviving member of his family, his grand-nephew, to fulfill an ancient druid 'thorn' curse.  The movie dosen't even seem to try to make sense, but I do go see these type of movies simply to see the classic killers in new surrondings.

791067,1,6304136242,"Halloween 6 is, plain and simple, a mess. There are so many things wrong with this horrid, slapped together monstrosity. First of all, the movie was way too short to have that many murders in it. It suffers from a major case of overkill. The flimsy, over the top, and plain stupid plot has Michael terrorizing a new family(the father is the brother of the man that adopted Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie Strode)that have moved into his old home. Dr. Loomis is pulled out of retirement one more time. A silly plot has Michael's niece Jamie giving birth to his baby. Huh?. Eww!. Michael's mission is to find that baby. The baby, however, has fallen into the hands of Tommy Doyle(the solid Paul Rudd), who was the little boy Jamie Lee babysat in the original. Many scenes are very, very quick and pretty much uneeded. You see too much of Michael, which is always a bad thing. The ending was horrible and pretty confusing. What in the world was it supposed to mean?. And, sadly, the great Donald Pleasence was wasted in this film given nothing to do. He spouts dialogue that, at times, are awful, and other times, the same rehash that he says in every film since the original. It is obvious that the man(then 75)was not in the best of shape. God bless him for sticking with it and doing the best he can with the pathetic material. He was a trooper and a true gentleman tll the end. This wonderful man deserved so much better. So do the fans of these movies. Not to say that there aren't things in it that I liked. I liked Tommy Doyle being back from the original, as well as George Wilbur(from Part 4)giving another great turn as Michael. He is a bulkier man and a more hulking, dangerous presence than other Michael's. The mask was also better than the last two. A good Michael performance. There were scenes that were nicely shot and really looked and felt like Halloween. Like something sinister was going on. That's always important to me with a 'Halloween' film. That it looks and feels like fall. It is a major character in these movies for me. That's about it. There is very little else to recommend about this movie. It's too bad. There are parts that looked like it was once an interesting movie in it's early stages, but producers and the director got in the way and didn't know how to make a Halloween movie. The revelation of the man in black was a horrible disappointment. This is it?. This is the answer to this guy's identity that fans have been waiting for for six long years?. What a letdown. The whole storyline for that character was stupid anyways. The writer could of at least given us a decent conclusion to that character to make up for the idiodicy of the whole thing. Sadly, that doesn't happen. The score in this film isn't good either. This is a horrid, slapped together, by the numbers pile of crud that ruins everything there is about the Halloween movie series. Nothing good can be said about this mess of a film at all. We should be thankful that H20 came along and saved the franchise. Ignoring this film the better.

This one brings Halloween back to it's roots, with the return of Tommy Doyle( the boy from the first one) and Dr. Loomis as the main heroes. Plus it brings Michael Back to being a killer period, no lovey dovey like in 5 with his niece, just straight out killing people, the way we love it.

The problem arises when producers wish to keep the Michael Myers gravytrain rolling but have no course on which to set it. John Carpenter established that Myers was pure evil - and that worked within the relentless context of the first film. But as time goes by (and movies get made), the excuses for bringing back Myers become not only silly, but so unimaginative as to show a complete disregard for the money-paying public. ""Curse of MM"" has no creative core - only producers and distributers after a quick  buck. It's a shame, because Michael Myers started out a pretty good kid. Now look what he's turned into. Beware this movie and return to the source. ""Halloween"" is still the scariest movie you can put into your VCR.",998697600,3,813,4.725352112676056
791133,2,6304136242,"This was the ""Halloween"" flick that fans of the franchise waited 8 years for. Sadly it did not live up to expectations.
After the very stupid ending of ""H5"", how could the producers bring back Michael? Easy, by ignoring the other films and adding a hokey plot about Michael being in some stupid cult. Realy believable huh? The film starts with Jamie (this time not played by Danielle Harris)having Michael's baby, don't ask I'm confused as well. She escapes her captors with the baby and runs away.
She is killed eventually, and the baby is found by Tommy Doyle (Played By Paul Rudd-""Clueless""). Michael goes back to ""Haddonfield"" poor town, to wreak some more havoc. He now goes after the people living in the old Strode house. I know guys my head hurts too.
Michael starts knocking people off ""Jason"" style. Hacking without any suspense. He kills a woman who eeriely resembles the main character of the mom from the defunct TV show ""Mama's Family"" with an axe. Since when our old pal Mikey went the savage route? He electrocutes another until his head explodes, and he even decimates a room full of doctors with a knife so big it could have been the ""Green Destiny"" sword from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""
This is all a bit much for me. Not because it's gory, but because it is so out of character for Michael Myers. Michael was very calm and watched you for a while before he actually attacked. Here he just slices and dices away. Also he is so fat in this movie, what was he eating while he was away? Twinkies?
The movie gets points for the way the mask looks, it looks pretty scary. But the film is too resemblant of the silly splatter flicks that pretty much ruined the horror genre. Donald Pleasance in his last film role, trys his best to bring some credibility to the film. Sadly it did not help. The ending is such a bore, we all know you cant beat Michael with a metal pipe and expect him to stay down.
This flick is pretty bad, but not as bad as ""Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch."" By now the premise is just tired. The filmmakers have ignored the previous storyline. I hear there is some special ""Producers Cut"" of the film but I doubt that it would have added much to this convoluted story any way.",997488000,,2217,4.463054187192118

Whats good about the flick is that it gives some explanation as to why he has the nerve to wipe his family off the planet.  Its not too good of a reason, but it sheds some light on some previously unexplainable things.  Myers goes all out in this one, taking bloody murders to a whole new level as he breaks necks, slices juglars, and makes heads explode (literally).  The violence in the movie is kinda too much, but when you think about it, how many scary films don't have blood and gore?  Not much.  Still though, the movie is overall just average and doesn't live up to this once oh so great series.  At the most, its a weekend rental.",995068800,,904,4.345238095238095
791135,3,6304136242,"Since the Producer's Cut has never officially been released (bootleg copies are available), and this page is for the theatrical release, I'll have to review that one. As it stands, the Theatrical Cut is a rather odd film. The film was heavily dissected by director Joe Chappelle during post-production: many scenes were trimmed, rearranged, or entirely cut out, gruesome deaths were added, the music was changed, and the final 15 minutes or so (virtually the entire final act of the film) was completely reshot. After a six year disappearance, Jamie Lloyd suddenly appears Halloween Eve on a radio talk show, frantically calling for Dr. Loomis. Michael is back, looking for Jamie's baby after he kills her. The baby is found by the know-grown up Tommy Doyle from the original film, played by Paul Stephen Rudd, who has become obsessed with Michael over the years. And he thinks he's uncovered the reason behind Michael's madness. (The explanation is too long and complicated to go into here). THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS was probably the least successful HALLOWEEN film, but a lot of series fan consider it one of the best. A lot of things in the film are confusing and left unexplained, as a result of Chappelle's meddling with things before it's release, but the film has a great sense of atmosphere and suspense. And Rudd is great as Tommy Doyle, a character that would be a worthy replacement for Dr. Loomis, now that the great Donald Pleasence is, sadly, no longer with us. And as Kara Strode, the lovely Marianne Hagan makes a great modern-day replacement for Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode in the original. The bootleg Producer's Cut is virtually a different film, with a stronger story and more answers to the questions raised by the film, with a surprise ending that is lightyears from the ending seen in theaters and on video. The theatrical version of the film is still an ok film, but the original version is great, possibly even the best since the original.

791300,4,6304136242,"By now, everybody knows that Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers was butchered by Dimension Films prior to release.  Several scenes were cut out of the film, others were shortened and the ending was entirely (and probaby for the best) reshot.  That's not to say that this theatrical cut ending is anything good...but acceptable and a little less silly than the original ending.
This sixth entry in the Halloween series has its problems to be sure, but it's also pretty scary.  Picking up six years after Halloween 5, we meet up again with Jamie Lloyd who has just given birth to a child in the confines on the Thorn cult compound.  Jamie escapes with her baby and Michael follows.  From here on, Michael returns to Haddonfield, Dr. Loomis (the returning Donald Pleasence in his final performance) is in pursuit and the mystery of the man in black is finally revealed.  The problem with this theatrical cut is that it's largely incoherent.  Most of the plot seems to have been removed, several key character development scenes have been snipped and what remains, is basically, the stalk and slash carnage that Michael Myers wreaks on the family living in the Myers house.
All of this may sound like carping, but far from it, this Halloween is actually one of the scariest (right behind 1 and 4), although it never quite matches up to those superior Halloween films, this one gives the viewer plenty of spooky scenes and some undeniable suspense.  Rising star Paul Rudd turns up in an early starring role as Tommy Doyle who Laurie Strode babysat for in the original film.  Tommy is now obsessed with Michael and knows that he has returned.  Rudd's Tommy is a great character, Paul Rudd brings a lot of charm and charisma to the role-he makes for a great screen presence, it's too bad the series wouldn't revisit this character, for he is much more interesting than the sniveling alcoholic Jamie Lee Curtis gave us in Halloween H20.
Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers is widely debated amongst Halloween fans, while it's flawed to the extreme, to deny its impact is to be ignorant.  Director Joe Chappelle takes a lot of flak for this film, but he actually infuses a lot of style and suspense into the 88 minue running time.  The operating room massacre scene is a highlight among the Halloween series..not to mention the cool quick cut opening.  In an earlier cut of the film, Chappelle actually comes off as a much stronger director, we see lots of awesome homages to the orginal Halloween such as a scene of Michael stalking Kara as she walks home from school, and a scene of Dr. Loomis fighting with the local police.  Many nice touches were abandoned in favor of a shorter film...it really is a shame.
In the hands of a more capable, competant studio, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers may have had a better chance...the makings of a great sequel were definately there (track down the infamous H6 producers cut).  As it stands, turn your brain off, turn down the lights and be ready to be scared.

The plot from this movie differs a bit from 4 and 5, and that's what this series needed, a change.  But the change the movie took shoudn't have happened like this.  Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie just like every other Halloween but I mean come on, thorn?  I remember the good old days when Michael was just a psychopath who escaped from a sanitarium.  That was simple.  When you introduce the thorn aspect it ""totally"" takes away the simplicity that made the original so great.  Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) returns for his last film before he past away.  And as always, he gave a great performance.  This movie is explicitly violent, and gory.  The soundtrack was just annoying.  And the fact that they killed Jamie was a real dissapointment to me.  Hey, at least the plot was interesting and fresh.  And as always, the ending made us wonder which is always a plus.  In conclusion, I think die hard Halloween fans will enjoy, while other movie buffs will not be impressed.

791370,4,6304136242,"Halloween 6 was probably the scariest Halloween yet.  It gets right off to Michael's killing spree, killing a nurse in probably the first 10 minutes of the film.  The music (especially the return of the ""chase"" music), scenery, setting, and sound effects create a suspensful edge-of-your seat atmosphere.  A good attempt to recreate the classic mask from 1 & 2 was made, doing away with the featureless mask from 4 & 5.  A few drawbacks though; Jamie Lloyd returns, but her age doesn't match up with the time frame of the series, also the hospital scenes are very confusing, trying to figure out what is going on with all the fetuses and the baby gets viewers totally lost.  All in all though, it is an edge-of-your-seat thriller, with the classic Michael we all remember!",974505600,,772,4.731343283582089

If you like the series you'll love this edition, the music rules. The theme in this one is really cool, and the song they play while Michael stalks someone is the best version they've ever made. The only bad part is the story. It's kinda wierd, but its still very cool. This was a great movie. So if you didn't like H5, but your still wondering who that man in black is( and what the symbol on Michaels arm means) this will answer most of you questions",973382400,,627,4.190082644628099

791373,3,6304136242,"As I stated in my review of No. 5, there are continuity problems in the Halloween series that serious detract from their quality.
Here we have relatives of Laurie Strode's foster parents living in the old Myers house. We go from the castle looking home in No. 5 to a regular old home in No. 6. Plus, the Myers house has been deserted since 1963 when Michael killed his first sister. Who would want to take the time to rebuild such an old relic? It would have been better if they had said they built a new home on the Myers old lot.
Also, why was the number 6 not put on the video box? Parts 2-5 have the number. Just nitpicking here, I guess.
Anyway, I agree with another review I saw that said things were not thoroughly explained in this installment. We realize that Jamie and Michael disappeared six years earlier from the Haddonfield jail after the explosion and ""jail break."" Jamie is now in labor having a child. Who is the father? Why was this not expounded on further? Was she artificially inseminated in an experiment to try and harness the evil of her uncle?
Plus, why is it that Michael has not slaughtered his keepers? He does so later on in the film, but apparently Dr. Winn had some kind of control over him, because they send him after Jamie when she escapes with her baby.
The best part of the storyline is the character of Tommy Doyle. A survivor of the Part I massacre, he is now a grown man who is as obsessed with Michael Myers as Dr. Loomis. His wall is covered with newspaper articles that help explain what he is doing. This was a good part of continuity.
No. 4 was good but it kept going downhill in No. 5 and No. 6. I was glad to see Jamie Lee Curtis revive her role in H2O. It was a nice piece of work that improved greatly on No. 6.",972864000,,1759,4.222551928783383

As a huge fan of Michael Myers, I was terribly disappointed with this.  First of all, Michael is a frumpy, beer-bellied leviathan who slouches through hallways.  Gone is the methodical pacing walk that made him so scary in other films.  His mask is a pathetic attempt at recreating the frightening mask of the first and second films.  Second, the storyline is so full of pseudo-magickal drivel that is practically destroys the mythos surrounding Michael in the previous installations (except 5, of course, in which they mistakenly introduced this whole runic/Thorn business).  All I can say is, thank God H:20 came along and pretended that this movie had never been made.  If only that were the truth.

I don't agree with the amount of gore that is displayed throughout however, it is no worse than any of the Jason movies.  If you're a true Halloween fan than you'll watch it.  Even though some parts make you laugh or make you mad, deal with it.  Besides, for all you critics out there, do you think you could make a better movie?
Now for the next part.  As most of you true fans should now, Halloween 8 is in the process of being developed.  Shooting is schedule for Spring 2001 so they are probably just deciding on a script right now.  Let's hope they stay away from the whole Thorn idea.  It wasn't done right in 6 and I doubt it will be done right in 8.  So here's hoping that it's back to basic Michael!",971481600,,1003,4.01010101010101

But despite it's many faults, a multitude of cheap shocks not being the least of which, Curse remains as much a guilty pleasure today as it did five years ago.  So why's it so respectable?  Maybe it has something to do with the low standards set by the previous three sequels but this supposedly (we all no better now) final chapter actually makes an attempt at a cohesive story.  It's well paced if not all that coherent and at 88 minutes is just the right length for a slasher movie of this kind.  If you can bear the first five minutes or so (especially fans of the orginal who must cringe at the notion that Michael is tied to an underground Druid cult) things pick up from there.  Bodies fall at the wayside as Michael slashes his way through teens by the dozens.  Our central protagonist, though if you're anything like me you're rooting for Mike, consist of Dr. Loonis (that's not a misprint!) whose apparently grown increasingly eccentric through the years, a single mother with an abusive father and uneviable address and Billy - one of the last surviors of the original Halloween, though he's not played by the same actor.  As you might expect the three band together for a dramatic climax that's a bit of a letdown but getting there's all the fun.  By the way, listen for Leo Getter in a small role as a Howard Stern-esque shock jock whose running radio commentary gives the series some perpective as well as a dash of self-satire.",970704000,,1563,4.573476702508961

That said, this movie actually angered me when I saw it in the theatre and again on video.  What once had  been a genuinely frightening, well-scripted, brilliantly-directed horror  film had just been completely ""butchered"" (pun intended).
In  ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Meyers,"" Michael has been  reduced to the same level of numb idiocy that his cousins Jason and Freddy  reached as they were spun out sequel by sequel.  Michael's entire appeal as  a mindless ""evil machine"" gets trounced when his motivations are  so unfortunately EXPLAINED.  Are those people Druids at the beginning?  The  whole thorn tattoo and baby sacrifice are beyond ridiculous.  ""Dr.  Loomis, how do you know Michael is coming back THIS year?""  ""Well  kids...it's written in the stars!""
Donald Pleasance has one foot  and 4 toes in the grave in this film, which lead me to hope that Michael  would just gut him and put him out of his misery.  Poor Doc Loomis spends  most of the film trying to get up from a variety of sofas.  The death  scenes are laughably stupid...death by washing machine was my favorite.  I  also loved that the town had BANNED Halloween as if all shop owners  peddling Hershey miniatures would be hauled off to the pokey.  Any child  caught watching ""Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin"" will be  grounded for a week!

The intense sound of the movie enhances the creepy factor,  I know this one's scarier than H20. And one of the reason's is because of  Wilbur's performance. The story contains elements about the Thorn guys that  really rely too much on Michael not harming them. Because they get some  pretty gruesome deaths near the film's conclusion.

791641,4,6304136242,"Many people say that Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers is the worst of the entire series, but I disagree. In my opinion, the worst is Halloween III. This movie originally had a very different storyline from the version  that people got to see, and they were severely deprived. The version of  this movie that got released was well done, with George Wilbur (Halloween  4) returning as Michael, and Donald Pleasance in his last performance as  Dr. Loomis, was well performed, but not very well explained. It seemed to  me that Dr. Wynn was attempting to genetically engineer people to have  Michael's form of strength, but I could be way off. I also thought the idea  of Michael killing his sister's 'extended' family was a clever plot twist.  Many people say this is the worst because they don't take the time to  really observe the story. However, I think that Dimension Films would be  real smart if they released the alternate cut of this movie on video &  DVD. There is a summary and pictures from this version that can be found on  the Halloween website. You might want to check it out. But this movie,  while somewhat vague, is an excellent piece of the story of Michael Myers.",950918400,35,1185,4.6124401913875595

791643,5,6304136242,"I think this was the best Halloween movie ever.  It brought a good presentation of being in the 90's.  It explained everything about the cult.  I do wish the originally Jamie would have been cast.  It was shocker to  find out Wen was the man in the black trench and boots.  Although it was  totally different from the others, except for Donald Pleasent making seem  like home to us it was still a great movie.  It's to bad Dr. Loomis died of  the hand sof Micheal, but more sad that Donald Pleasent died in real life.  It was still the best with quite a twist.",949708800,5,560,4.238095238095238

791645,1,6304136242,"This movie, produced in 1996 by John Carpenter was by far the worst slasher movie I have ever seen. The plot is at it's lowest end. Jamie Lloyd  disapears 6 years ago with her demonic uncle in a fire. Her body is found,  but what Myers wanted from her was her child. According to the plot what  this film was trying to explain to us was that Michael must kill his  bloodline for the cult he is with. As soon as this is done he can rest. The  plot of this cult ruined the film as it was too incredible and far too  drawn out and boring. As well as this the film was far too gory and there  were no jumps or scares that we usually expect to see in the slasher movie.  The acting is desperate, with a host of unknowns. Donald Pleasance (Michael  Myer's doctor Dr. Sam Loomis) returns once more to fight the beast. He is  the only person that keeps us watching the film to see what becomes of  Michael Myers. John Carpenter who wrote Halloween 6 along with the other  prequels made this film in memory of the renowned actor. Couldn't they have  honoured him in some better way? Worn out slasher movie, made to try and  squeeze a few more dollars out of the series.",947894400,,1160,4.166666666666667
791646,1,6304136242,"Halloween 6 is by far the worst in the series. It ties him in with the druids, and tells how he becomes motivated to kill. Horribly made. Donald Pleasence looks like Santa! You can just see him looking out into the  audience saying ""This is awful."" Also, I haven't seen this much  gore or killing in a long time. I think more people die in this movie, than  in 1, 4, & H20 combined! This movie is similar to ""Halloween  2"" in the gore catergory. This movie is also only really good if you  haven't seen any of the others, but know the story line.",946425600,,546,4.161904761904762
791647,4,6304136242,"This movie was in my opinion the best entry in the series save for parts 1, 2, and H20. Paul Rudd is a great Tommy Doyle, and I would have liked to have seen what his character would do next. The fact is, H20 really didn't  ""write off"" the other films as traumatically as most people would  think, being that Laurie Strode had a few secrets, one of which could be  the fact that she had another child, etc. I would like to see the series  more deeply delve into the subject matter presented here, but also combine  the events in H20. The directors cut ofthis film is said to be almost a  half an hour longer and ties together the loose plot threads, so I want my  DVD version!  Where is it?",945820800,,690,4.135338345864661

791680,1,6304136242,Worn out slasher movie produced by John Carpenter which in my opinion is an insult to the Halloween series as a whole. The storyline is terrible.

However, I had to watch it a few times to truly  enjoy it.  I am a longtime fan of Donald Pleasence and this movie just  seemed to be the last thing that Pleasence really wanted to do.  One thing  that I truly enjoyed about this movie, although it was a very sad thing,  was seeing the movie dedicated to the memory of Donald Pleasence.  I wish  that I saw more done on the life of Donald Pleasence.  Overall, if you are  a true die hard fan of Michael Myers, you should enjoy this movie.  If you  are not a major Halloween fan, this movie is not for you.  On a side note,  when is the so-called Producer's Cut going to be released.  From what I  have heard, the Producer's Cut sounds ten times better than the current  home video version.",939772800,2,909,4.229411764705882

The story was a good one in the first two parts, the third was a total shame, 4 and  5, in my opinion really topped the first two... Danielle Harris was great.  Now for the 6th part, they didn't reach the price of Danielle Harris and  she doesn't even appear, plus the story is a total fraud... it tries to  make it look more ""commercially understandable"" with this stuff  about the ""curse"", I mean... Get real... fortunately H20 is a lot  better.
I have to admit one thing: The soundtrack rocks, one of the best  for halloween, and quite different. Plus the photography is somewhat  interesting.",933552000,,730,4.561538461538461

7862517,5,6304136242,"It's officially B season folks! Thanks to cable showing horror movies consistently throughout October it's that glorious time of year during which we are guaranteed at least a bakers dozen of B until Halloween. As any true B enthusiast will tell you 1:00-3:00 is the best chance for quality, this can be either AM or PM. I'll put a 2:00 start on a Monday afternoon up against 2:00 on Saturday night no problem. When the guide presents you with Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, seeing it in the theater and Paul Rudd? Yeah pretty sure that was Paul Rudd haha immediately spring to mind. This has not been viewed since its release in 95 but back then it was not favored by Sid at all. The expectations were different, wanting a scary movie and watching this is no laughing matter. But wanting beautiful B and watching this one was literally a laugh a minute.

Remember Jamie, the little girl in the clown costume from 4&5? She's all growns up and is having a kid of her own in the insane asylum. Immediately after the birth, a nurse helps her escape from the main man Myers. She makes it to a bus station in the pouring rain with her baby but nobody is there so she does what any sane person would: call a talk radio show with an impassioned plea for help from the only person who could save her, Dr. Samuel F. Loomis. It didn't end well for Jamie but her baby was nowhere to be found. We are then introduced to Kara Strode who is related to Laurie somehow, it was never really explained. She has moved back home with her meek 1950s mother and her jerk of a father who looks just like the manager of burger world. This guy's just begging to be an example of. Kara has a son, his grandson, and he's very mean to the kid and smacks Kara! We come to find out that this gem of a guy has moved his family into casa Myers without their knowledge. Oh boy you're now uninsurable, even Loomis couldn't help them. Who can though? Tommy Doyle, yup he's overcome his astronaut pj wetting and is now the creepy guy from the boarding house across the street who watches the Myers house nonstop, played by Paul Rudd. He ends up finding Jamie's baby she stashed at the bus depot because he was listening to the radio show she called into and knew she was at the bus station. Reasonably, he tracks down 92 year old Loomis for protection of himself, Kara, Danny (Kara's son), and Steven(Jamie's baby who Rudd named).

So it's this crew vs. Myers...and an insane cult! They tried to explain that Myers is crazy crazy because he's a mechanism of this nutso cult and he's triggered by an alignment of the stars that happens around the fall solstice every 20 years or so. Sure why not? Go ahead and laugh, but when you watch this one, you'll have a moment of ""oh ok, pretty clever Halloween 6. Astronomy and stuff, it kind of works."" The cult wants Jamie's baby because he's the last of the Myers lineage. More Myers backstory was revealed by the old lady who owned Tommy's boardinghouse. She was babysitting ""little Mikey Myers"" that night he killed his sister. Yeah job well done Mrs. Blankenship. She said Danny heard the voice just like Myers which absolutely explains his drawing of everyone in his family from earlier in the film. Fantastic. We end up hearing the voice several times calling to Danny. This makes him make bad decisions even for a mid 90s b horror. Danny walks from relative safety in tommy's room to the Myers house where there's already a body count mounting. Mr. Myers' guests at his home this evening will be the source of the voice, basically just a guy dressed like zoro with his entire face covered, and his minions the cult members. These cult members are actually the same crew from The Final Sacrifice, quite a run from those guys. The cult ends up capturing everybody, including Tommy and Loomis who of course show up just in time to bring the characters together...only to split them apart again. Not all bad though because kara executed an effective 90s awful window jump through as required by the b bylaws. Kara Danny and the baby are taken away while Tommy and Loomis are drugged and released. Great work in this scene by Loomis and Rudd by the way. Not saying it was Pacino and de Niro in heat, but it was in the ballpark. Rudd figures out that nobody really knew he had the baby except for Kara, Danny, and Loomis. He asks Loomis who he told about the baby and it's Loomis's partner, Dr. Wynn. Loomis knows immediately that Myers has taken Kara Danny and the baby to smith's grove, the mental institution Myers and Loomis shared for 15 years. ""It's his game, he says to Tommy. ""I know where he wants to play it."" Wow. The last ever pantheon level Loomis line. So they go to the old loony bin. At Smith's Grove things get nuts.  We find out that Dr. Wynn is the voice and the leader of the cult. He then goes into some weird surgery that's never explained. Meanwhile Myers is hunting down Tommy and Kara after Tommy helped her escape her cell. Myers finds a surgical tray, obviously choosing a weapon. He passes up the scalpel for another common surgical tool, the machete. Myers appears confused maybe, or he wants to take his new toy out for a spin. He ambles into that operating room and is as savage as ever in a few short strobe lit moments. Maybe it was the cable edit, but it was a really cool violent, but not overly gory scene.

In the end, Tommy slips Myers the hot seditive injection with like five needles and Kara beats him up with a lead pipe. Tommy has to inject him again and beats him up some more, a lot more. Green stuff comes out of the famous mask. Tommy, Loomis and the gang reconvene outside and as everyone but Loomis leaves as he tells them that he has work to finish up inside. The mask and only the mask is where Myers was laid out and a jack-o-lantern is shown as the candle goes out. Then the screen reads ""In memory of Donald Plessance"" RIP Dr. Loomis.

Back in the day, Sid thought this was a horrible movie. Sid is also a big enough little man to admit he was wrong. This is one of the most underrated 90d horror b's. It had everything. Multiple plot holes and characters who acted as though they were brain dead, impossiblities, over acting, and cheesy lines. It also is very unassuming, it does not expect you to have any ability to reason or deduce things. Last thoughts, Myers and Loomis were at their best here since 2. Really nice to see that duo go out on a high note. And, the end was really ambiguous. Did Myers die? Did Loomis have to go back into the institution because he was a bad guy like his partner? Thought provoking, as are all Halloween films.

Drive in totals:

1 face pushed through prison like bars in the mental institution

1 super duper electrocution

1 exploded head

6 bad stunts

And about 18 questions the movie puts out there and never goes back to.",1508803200,2,6835,4.403800475059382
