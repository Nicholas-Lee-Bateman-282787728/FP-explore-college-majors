6068478,3,B00GAJFIXO,"A European twist on the traditional gangster revenge movie.  If you like Lock Stock and 4 Smoking Barrels, A Walk Among the Tombstones, etc. then this is a movie right in that genre.  But its a European movie so it is different -- think of Robert DiNero in ""Ronan"" the violence is less frequent, but more graphic after the fact, the dialogue is more philosophical and introspective and the pace is much slower than a US or Chinese made counterpart. The movie is in French with subtitles.

The story is simple of a former Gangland Boss with principles who retires but is dragged back in when the people he left behind violate these principles. It is also a good Jean Reno film, if you like him in other films then you will get more of what you expect.

I enjoyed it, glad it was part of Prime, you will too",1529452800,,805,4.346666666666667

6068484,4,B00GAJFIXO,"I certainly didn't like the subtitles. Hard to really enjoy a movie while your focus is on the words. Other than that the movie was pretty good.

Instead of delivering the standard cliche in the climactic scene,
the movie threw me off guard when the protagonist showed feeling.
After that scene, the scene with his own brother, what he did in
the end, a deliverance to lift the burden of guilt off of him, this movie
had something Hollywood wouldn't have given it without rising
to a new level and becoming more deep.",1528243200,,440,4.582278481012659

6068489,2,B00GAJFIXO,"Jean Reno is a good actor but I'm not a fan of action-type movies with a lot of killing going on. I should have realized it was purely an action movie from the title I guess.

6068490,3,B00GAJFIXO,"Trailer was in English. It was by the producer of Taken and the Transporter, both English movies. But not one word of English in the movie.
No twist like the trailer said. He doesn't get more brutal after his son's taken. It was OK.
How can you make an English trailer for a French movie and even pretend you aren't ripping people off? You know you screwed anyone that bought this, right?",1527292800,,388,4.402777777777778
6068491,4,B00GAJFIXO,It's a decent story with characters that I enjoyed. It's a good film to watch if you're browsing through Prime and just can't find anything.,1526947200,,140,4.64

6068493,5,B00GAJFIXO,For me though the total draw is Jean Reno who has a sex-appeal second to none. The fact that it was a foreign language film didn't bother me in the least as being a bit. It was a good story to my mind the guys who ambushed Jean Reno deserved everything he did to them back in spades! Excellent movie.,1526688000,,300,4.016666666666667
6068494,5,B00GAJFIXO,"The film is beautifully scored and the cinematography just adds to the nostalgia of an old school mobster movie saddled with revenge and morality.

6068497,4,B00GAJFIXO,"These French action-revenge films of the past 10 years are pretty awesome, especially considering how well-worn this ex-hitman rampage premise is. 22 Bullets is another good one. 22 Bullets is the regional U.S./ English title of L'Immortal, which if you haven't guessed or are not really, really fluent in French means ""The Immortal"", a movie title as forgettable as scientifically possible. Before getting into content I'm gonna jump on my horse and scold the masses who leave negative reviews complaining about subtitles. Non-English speaking countries have their own domestic film industries, believe it or not. And if you're too slow to read subs and actually watch the movie, well, learn to read better. Think of all the little bits of information spelled out in letters surrounding every moment of your daily life that you're missing, all because you never picked up a book. Fine if you don't like watching a flick with subs but don't judge the quality of the film based on your own shortcomings. Plus it's embarrassing America at a time we can ill-afford further embarrassment. Now about the movie... Pretty good.",1526342400,,1120,5.092391304347826

6068501,3,B00GAJFIXO,"Good show. It's another mobster type movie with a similar theme, but it's still good.  It French with subtitles so you have to get used to that.  I've watced several Russian and French movies now on Amazon so I'm getting used to reading a lot.",1525824000,,243,4.377777777777778
6068502,1,B00GAJFIXO,"do you think the director of this movie let you know that:

""The gang specialised in burglaries, hold-ups and racketeering, and was said to have built a cellar in their club in which people who resisted paying protection money would be tortured. It was while he was in this gang, mainly composed of Marseille Italians, that Imbert met another future gang leader, Tany Zampa, with whom he would forge a close friendship. ""

so you are rooting for a torturer, murderer, and criminal - who wants to retire.  this movie is based on a real life story. i didn't know...

the real life character for which Reno represents is too much a devil to have any character compassion or care imho.  my dislike in this movie is in the details (SPOILER ALERT such as how they portrayed the assassination as a drunken drive by to the silliness strategically and tactically of the hideout house by the beach scene) i actually believe in real life Reno is more like Zampa who appears less evil.  Read this from wiki and if you just saw the movie ask yourself, wait, what????

""In 1961 he was convicted of pimping in a case involving Raymond Infantes, the kingpin of Oran's brothels, and condemned to six months in prison. Infantes had played on his connections to escape a prison sentence while implicating Imbert, who would never forgive him. Under cover of the night, he piloted a small Cessna across the Mediterranean to Algeria, kidnapped Infantes and brought him back to Marseille, where he tortured him and demanded a large sum of money as ransom. Fearing for his life Infantes paid up, and the money permitted Imbert to set up his own gang. Imbert hired twenty men without Zampa's knowledge and, while appearing to remain under Zampa's control, he began to run his own separate organisation.""

not only do i not understand why this movie was made, i feel like the better story is anyone but Imbert/Reno... i also don't understand the liberties the director took to tell this story.  the movie needs to begin much earlier in the characters life for us to root for him.  instead they hope Reno listening to opera smiling is enough?

""On 1 February 1977 Imbert survived a murder attempt by Tony Zampa's crew. Legend has it that one of the men said: ""a swine like him isn't worth 'le coup de grce' let him die like a dog""[citation needed]. He was shot many times and doctors removed twenty-two projectiles, including seven bullets, from his body. His right arm remained paralysed as a result of the attack"".

OK so the more detail you get about Imbert/Reno the more you find out how cruel he is, and almost become sympathetic to those trying to kill him.  so odd, a movie not attempting to make us care for the ""hero"" and without Reno it couldn't even try.

i don't like the details in this movie, i get its a local crew but they are all portrayed like pyschos working for the Joker in the Batman.  and yet the most pyscho of all henchmen reveals he is a super programmer and can help Reno - that scene and logic is on the director and writers.  SPOILER: do they really think when under death attack, yes 22 bullets is a death attack, they still put the kids in public school?  after Kasim gets hacked up?  not a chance, that type of non logic makes you lose a star?",1525824000,2,3248,4.542024013722127
6068503,5,B00GAJFIXO,Excellent movie.  Love Jean Reno.  Lots of action.,1525824000,,50,5.125
6068504,5,B00GAJFIXO,"I don't do Italian Operas. But the soundtrack is beautiful. Firstly one must realize it's a Mafia picture and you can only tell it so many different ways. This way was done right. I must be learning to appreciate the finer things in life and reading English sub-titles seems to be one of them. Mr. Jean Remo was cast right for this film. I kept going to the cast feature to see what other movies I've seen some of the other actors in. Nice feature. Showing the family effect and its part of the plot added some dynamic to the overall film. Plenty of chase sequences and firepower get the job done. It's worth the time watching if you don't mind the captions. Amazon, keep the suggestion box full of titles like this and I won't have to search very far for my entertainment.",1525737600,,773,4.375
6068505,3,B00GAJFIXO,"Jean Reno is superb, but the movie suffers from choppy editing and a predictable plot. Even the supposed ""twist"" at the end really isn't, because by the time of the ""reveal,"" the movie has totally soft-pitched it to you. It's hard to get behind Reno's character, even though you are obviously supposed to. I generally don't like subtitled movies.

6068513,5,B00GAJFIXO,It is Subtitled so if you do not like that than beware.  I happen to think that most original movies out there are subtitled as Hollywood is recycling old movies.  Jean Reno is awesome as usual.  I liked it more as It included the nation that France is now with Muslims as a part of the population and their involvement as Gangsters. It is refreshing that they aren't just labeled as terrorists. They are gangsters like the Irish and Italians of yore in the good ole USA. Just enjoy the show :),1524182400,,494,4.3478260869565215
6068514,4,B00GAJFIXO,Once you get over the seemingly incredulous -- anyone could survive a hail of 22 bullets and a renowned mobster is actually morally sound and just a family guy -- it's a great movie. Characters are interesting. It has French moral ambiguity. It's fast paced and a pretty good shoot 'em up. I suppose what makes it different than a typical revenge movie is it's not over the top.

6068552,5,B00GAJFIXO,"I really enjoyed watching Jean Reno. He is a fantastic actor. I don't speak French, but the subtitles weren't intrusive because I subtitle everything, even English.

6068565,4,B00GAJFIXO,"Movie was well done. Based on the life of Jackie Imbert.  The movie has a main thread of truth that keeps it based on a real life story.  It certainly is fictionalized but he was shot 22 times and he did seek his revenge.  Hard to watch these gagsters have total disregard for life and inflicted torture but there actually way too many people like this.  The acting is superb. It is a, sometimes, difficult but interesting movie to watch. Jean Reno does a great job acting as Charly Matte.",1519516800,,489,4.4

6068567,4,B00GAJFIXO,I was hooked when I realized that the audio was 5.1 surround. The video was theater aspect. I read the entire movie because there was action and violence. There was lots of shooting as the title implies. There was good pursuit scenes. I didn't have to keep the volume up because understanding the talking was not an issue.

6068586,4,B00GAJFIXO,"I typical prefer movies that challenge the mind a bit, not just a ""good guy, bad guy shootem up"".  I was surprisingly entertained by this film. I thought it was well acted, it had suspense, action, and even emotional angles that I didn't expect.  I don't mind subtitles, and if you are not used to that.....don't let it scare you off.  As I told one of the other reviewers, 10 minutes into it, you totally forget that you are reading.  I didn't give 5 stars because I reserve that for shows and films that are truly exceptional.
One additional note, it's a little confusing at the beginning as the movie is jumping back and forth between past and present but it all comes together within about 15 or 20 minutes.....be patient.",1518739200,5,726,4.519083969465649

6068594,4,B00GAJFIXO,I've yet to be disappointed by a Jean Reno film. His performances are captivating and 22 Bullets is no exception. A wild ride from start to finish.,1518480000,,147,4.481481481481482
6068595,1,B00GAJFIXO,"In real life; the mobster was shot with 7-bullets and 15-shotgun-pellets. In real-life; the mobster had NOT retired and thus, had a crew to retaliate, and was not against drugs, and was nicknamed ""crazy"" or ""the madman"".

There is a very gruesome scene of torture, which a memory you do NOT want to go to sleep with at night.

The film has the heroic mobster let an enemy-man go free against the protest of his loyal-underling, who rightfully says the enemy-man will inform the enemy-boss on all of us, which is just what happens, and the loyal-underling, who said this, is promptly kidnapped by that enemy-boss and brutally tortured to death. Thus, the heroic mobster knowingly placed his loyal-underling in the path of certain torture and death by that decision.

That said; the movie portrays Jean Reno as a retired, likeable, mobster, who prohibits his friend, who takes-over over his gambling-dens, night-clubs, and gang, from selling drugs. The film has a lot of intrigue, which will keep your rapt attention / deeply-engrossed, attention. There is plenty of action and close-calls. As an action film with some suspense, good-guys vs. bad-guys; it is 5-stars.",1518393600,,1165,5.025906735751295

When the mafia head was murdered, Jean Reno takes revenge with the help of his friends.  They made a pack to be friends until after death, but one of his friends becomes an enemy later in life.  Jean Reno is feared by all in the mafia business, but he has morals/rules such as no drugs, no killing family members, and no killing police.  When he built a family with his second wife with a daughter and son, he decided to leave the business behind, but as the mafia head once told him, it's a business that you can't get out once you are in it.  His friend wanting to take the business further by involving drugs decides to take out Jean Reno in case he comes back due to issues with the new business model.  After putting 22 bullets into Jean Reno, he doesn't die.  He went after the people responsible for shooting him, but he refused to go after his friend until his friend decides to go after his family and assistants.  Jean Reno has three assistants, a counselor/attorney, a Muslim body guard and a female body guard.  Acting was good and the direction was good.",1517788800,9,1231,4.407079646017699

6068643,5,B00GAJFIXO,"Jean Reno stars in this solid French action film supposedly inspired by real events. Well, inspired by real events that then inspired a certain Franz-Olivier Giesbert to write a story entitled L Immortal.

By synopsis is fairly straightforward. We have a former organised crime boss king pin who turned his back on his former life of crime, sold off his interests to a couple of other long time criminal buddies of his and then settles down for a cozy retirement. Then, for seemingly no reason, he is brought back into play by an assassination attempt which sees him hit by 22 bullets. I kid you not Anyway he lives through this but with some physical limitations and then mulls over whether or not to inflict some payback. He is tipped over the edge into doing so when one of his crew is brutally killed.

And then Jean Reno does what he does. One by one he tracks down his killers and there is much blood letting. Tough dudes go down all over the shop, dropping like flies and things get even more personal when his children are kidnapped.

Tautly written with a tension that comes off the screen this movie features understated acting, solid support and minor cast players and the sort of quietly menacing figures that are under-utilised in the genre.

There isn't much here that is new or different or somehow novel. There are a few elements of brutality that add an edge to things but if you are an action fan there isn't anything here that will particularly make you squirm. What the film does best is show commitment on all levels to making the most intelligent use of the brutality. A commitment to use it to propel the viewers understanding of the world these career criminals and hard men inhabit.

Production values are good, there is atmospheric use of lighting and sets and intelligent use of camera angles and camera focuses. The soundtrack is well chosen and the editing is well rendered. It's a movie you'll watch once or twice per year. In other words, it's a keeper.",1459555200,3,1984,4.625

6068665,5,B00GAJFIXO,"Jean Reno is one of my favourite French actors after first seeing him in the most excellent `Leon'. He is again perfectly cast as the retired somewhat world-weary Marseilles mafia don trying to live a quiet family life. His nefarious past, of course, catches up with him and he is left for dead (but obviously isn't otherwise it would be a very short film). There then ensues a fairly standard bit of revenge thriller but Reno's brooding presence, the superbly taut direction, French stylishness and some splendidly seedy Marseilles locations lifts this film to the level of a classic. Being fairly fluent, the French dialogue wasn't a problem most of the time, but the subtitles came in handy many times thanks to the broad southern accent and slang (not that the translations of the more colourful phrases were terribly accurate - a common feature of subtitled French films & TV programs). Don't let the language put you off; you'll miss a treat.",1421452800,,948,4.8580246913580245

Had a good actor but basically low budget and reminds me of a grad student film. soft on plot, on action, character development, music score, and they can't even afford to have a English dub made. There is a reason it is less than $6. Go get The Professional/Leon if you want to see this actor put somewhere that he can flourish.",1417132800,,454,4.290697674418604

There's a police detective who tries to bring order while working in a city full of corrupt officials, both political & police.

I can honestly say, I could rewind and watch again immediately.  Subtitles do not bother me and I am always reminding people that they need to watch these films and not pass them up for that reason.

For me though the total draw is Jean Reno who has a sex-appeal second to none.  The fact that it was a foreign language film didn't bother me in the least as being a bit deaf, I watch with sub-titles anyway.  It was a good story and while it could be brutal, to my mind the guys who ambushed Jean Reno deserved everything he did to them  back in spades!  Excellent movie.",1403136000,2,542,4.264705882352941

6068702,5,B00GAJFIXO,"Jean Reno.........incredible actor!  This movie thickly weaves an exciting storyline about longtime friendship, loyalty, and betrayal.  Foreign films, for me, always exhibit a deeper and more meaningful content.  They are much less concerned with the ""commercial"" part that many American Films play into for success at that box office.  Even violence is portrayed in a much more realistic way, especially in this movie.  I do believe it is in my top 5 for foreign films.
Don't let the subtitles deter you.  This movie keeps you so very fixated on Jean Reno's Character and the exciting storyline that you won't even realize you are reading English Subtitles.",1397606400,2,658,5.160377358490566

The best comparison I can think of is to 'Beat"" Takeshi, the ultimate Japanese tough guy/cop/yakuza depending on the movie.  Jean Reno fills up the screen like no one else.  This is a violent movie, quite realistic in its bloodshed, but through it all there is a curiously moral code at the heart of it.  The juxtaposition between extreme violence & revenge really plays off the 'morality' of love of family, and the desire to protect it come what may.

6068706,3,B00GAJFIXO,"As the title implies, there's more than enough firepower engaged literally in this Marseille mob flick, but Jean Reno brings some figurative weaponry also to bear as the retired chieftain focused on his family's well-being.  His performance, complemented by a solid depiction of a lady police captain with family concerns of her own, carries us through a somewhat overused plotline, and the presence of some Muslim characters, also with families, adds interesting cultural richness at least for a US viewer.

6068715,5,B00GAJFIXO,"Jean-Pierre Darrousin will make any movie better and a good one great, as he does in this highly atmospheric and suspenseful adventure about an ex-gangster and his still wayward former cohorts.

Set in the beautiful French Riviera in and around Marseilles, the movie makes the location almost part of the cast and leaves you with a real sense of being there (or, as the case may be, a real sense of wanting to go back).

This is not a plodding art film.  This is a full throttle action thriller written with wit and intelligence.

He is what a James Bond actor should look like, not Mr. World, and yet a figure who inspires trust in his character(s) and he is rougher looking than Daniel Craig.

In the course of events, I end up rooting for him to succeed (I don't want to give away too much). The mark of a great movie and a good actor is to make you sympathize for someone who you would otherwise find totally unlikeable. This film succeeds because Jean-Pierre Darroussin is so damn good!
