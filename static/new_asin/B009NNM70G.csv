5353641,5,B009NNM70G,One of my all time favorite movies. Your missing out if you don't see it! It has so much passion about the loyalty of friendship.,1396656000,5,129,4.2
5353642,4,B009NNM70G,"All the things you assume about ""Need for Speed"" are all pretty accurate; it is juvenile, another ""Fast and Furious"" type movie and it is pretty much from beginning to end a car race, car chase, car crash type movie. While you may not like that type of thing, ""Need for Speed"" thankfully has more going on than just what its videogame origin promises. Fortunately, Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad), who plays Tobey Marshall, is a fantastic and passionate actor and he's joined by an entire group of actors and characters that will stick in your mind long after the film is over.

Watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that Tony Scott and Don Simpson left a mark on the world they have left behind. I kept thinking that it had that ""Top Gun"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Days of Thunder"" type feel to it. Everything in the film was just larger than life with beautiful sceneries, machismo splashed with comedy and characters that are as much over-the-top as the premise of their actions. Tobey Marshall is the `Maverick' type; loaded with skill but he can't seem to control it when he needs to. Maybe my love of those great Scott/Simpson/Bruckheimer movies of the 80s clouded my vision, but I felt it and it was a good thing.

Tobey Marshall is an A-class street racer and with that comes a strange sensation that you will have to have to overcome in order to enjoy the film.""Need for Speed"" is based upon a videogame and with that, you have to remember that this is absurdity. You have to think of ""Need for Speed"" as you would have thought about the Sylvester Stallone movie ""Death Race 2000"" from the 70s. When Marshall and his racing partners crash and weave through normal every day traffic, you will hate them because they are the kind of people you would hate if you were driving to work on a Tuesday morning, but you have to forget that. If you can't overlook that, then you won't enjoy the film.

Despite some poorly plotted and unrealistic moments toward the end, ""Need for Speed"" remains a cut above the rest when it comes to action/racing films. If you're assuming that it is just a bunch of racing and ridiculousness, than you would be wrong and right. It is about racing and ridiculousness, but within that are beautifully drawn characters with passionate purpose and endless humor and excitement for what they do. The intelligence of the driving and the brilliance of the racing sequences put ""Need for Speed"" over-the-top. Thanks to Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots, who plays a character that most men can only dream about, ""Need for Speed"" is endlessly interesting and impossible not to care about.",1396224000,35,2603,4.666666666666667
5353643,5,B009NNM70G,"Two thumbs up.  This movie actually has a decent story to it and also provides a few laughs.  The action is quite intense, and we found ourselves shifting gears from the theatre seats!  There are a variety of very nice cars in this movie, but the real car star appears first and again at the end.  What a beautiful machine!",1395964800,7,323,4.333333333333333
5353644,2,B009NNM70G,"1.  Will there ever be a great video game adaptation?

The other day, I read on a film blog that Splinter Cell finally grabbed a director (Doug Liman) and lead (Tom Hardy), which gives me hope...but it's really a mind bender that there hasn't ever been a great movie based on a video game.  I mean, some video games have incredible stories and cinematic element, and somehow they just don't transfer well on film.  Now, just reading months back that there would be a Need for Speed film made me roll my eyes, and I wasn't looking at this movie as the 'great hope' for video game to film greatness, but I was hoping that whoever wrote Need for Speed wouldn't treat it's audience like complete morons.

2.  Aaron Paul elevates whatever material he's given.

If I'm being honest (along with my wife, and probably thousands of others who shelled out their hard earned cash to see Need for Speed), the only reason I went to see this was because of Aaron Paul.  His turn as Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad was one of the most gut wrenching, heart pulling performances of all time, and any time I have the opportunity to see him do his thing on screen, I'm going to be there.  He was trying so hard with the material here, and despite the utter crap he's got to say on screen, he still manages to pull it off.  I have to tip my cap to Aaron Paul.  Such a talented actor.

3.  They let you play with iPads in military prison.

If there's one thing I learned from Need for Speed, it's that they have spare laptops laying around in hospitals and iPads in the brig.  At one point, a character is in a MILITARY PRISON, and casually asks a female guard (who clearly isn't interested) for an iPad to follow his buddy during an illegal race on what must be a cleverly designed app (found easily on the App store, I'm sure) - either that or it's just a website that anyone could hop onto and follow the race (paying attention, cops?).  So what does she do?  She grabs an iPad from the ol' Army surplus of iPads and connects to the Wi-Fi (again, in military jail) so that he can fist pump while his friend blows through traffic.

4.  The racing scenes were awesome.

The plot was so dumb, and makes absolutely no sense.  However, if you're going to see Need for Speed, you're really going for two reasons - Aaron Paul and the car chases, and let me tell you...the racing scenes delivered.  The roar of the engine, the skidding of tires, the exotic cars, they all looked beautiful.  They were shot amazingly and the lack of CGI really showed.  There was a great amount of effort into making the car scenes as cool as they were, and it paid off.  And that Mustang...that Mustang...it really made me miss mine.

5.  This plot was so dumb, and makes absolutely no sense.

Yeah, this is a car movie, but it's still a movie, right?  Up until our hero gets out of prison, I was with this plot.  Sure, the dialogue was hokey, and everyone on Aaron Paul's racing team came across as if they wanted to date him, but I was with it.  Then, it went completely off the rails.  When he gets out of prison, his plan is to enter this super secret race to get revenge against Dominic Cooper's villain character.  Exactly how though?  At this point, he doesn't even know if Cooper is in said race (and actually, he wasn't at that point).  Somewhere in there, the villain also enters the race, because he runs a failing auto dealership and needs a few more cars?  Also, can we address the fact that Kid Cudi plays a pilot who can fly anything...and does?  He randomly shows up in planes, news helicopters and at one point, an Apache, like he calmly goes to a rent-a-whateveryouneedforthisscene, and there he is, in the sky without difficulty.  Or Michael Keaton's character, who apparently puts this race on every year, who just broadcasts everything from his living room and is never caught...because...why?  This script really goes the extra 3,000 miles to insult the audience with stupidity.

If you're looking for a movie where you need to check your brain at the door...or completely chuck it out of a McLaren going 200mph, this is the movie for you.  My suggestion?  Wait until it hits Netflix and fast forward through the garbage that isn't car racing.",1395878400,2,4220,4.455613577023499
5353645,4,B009NNM70G,"Nine Things About the Movie Need For Speed

1. This movie is based on a car racing video game. So you know its not going to be deep.

2. Its also basically a 2-hour long Ford commercial.

3. But the movie is actually fairly interesting. Its more entertaining, slightly more realistic, and not as stupid as what the Fast & Furious movies have turned into.

4. Its about a former race car driver named Tobey and his friends. There is an ex-girlfriend and an old rival. Theres a plot. Stuff happens. People talk. They race cars. About twenty minutes into the movie you know the rest of the story. I figured out who was going to die, which would inspire Tobey to race for justice and revenge.

5. The story is ridiculous, but the acting is decent. The main female lead was not nearly as annoying as I expected her to be. And Michael Keaton almost steals the movie as a rich weirdo that sponsors a top-secret elite car race.

6. The movie was directed by Scott Waugh, who is an actual stuntman. He hated the fact that the Fast & Furious movies used computer-generated cars and races. He wanted to do all the car racing for real. Computer effects were only used to erase crew members and wires.

7. Waugh used up to 40 cameras at once to capture some of the scenes. A climactic crash scene lasted 12 seconds on screen, but took six hours to prepare.

8. The movie is worth seeing for its cinematography and driving scenes.

9. We certainly don't need two car-racing movie franchises in the world. But if we have to have one, put Fast & Furious in the garage and give people the Need for Speed.",1395446400,71,1587,4.370748299319728
5353646,3,B009NNM70G,"Dino (Dominic Cooper), the darling of Mt. Kisco, NY races formula cars. Everyone knows Toby (Aaron Paul) is a better racer, although he just street races...except for maybe Anita (Dakota Johnson) his ex-gf who now travels with Dino. Through a series of impossible circumstances, Toby gets arrested for stealing Dino's uncle car, which he didn't. Upon getting out of jail, he will travel from NY to California in 45 hours aka ""Smokey and the Bandit."" Imogen Poots takes the role of Sally Fields. He is going to participate in an unsanctioned, ""winner take all"" pink slip race. Oh yes, he is on parole too and can't leave NY and must drive three times the speed limit to make it in time. He doesn't quite make it by ground and needs to be lifted by a friend in a helicopter for the last leg...something they should have done to begin with. He now must face Dino in the race.

This whole script was stupid. The first thing any investigator wants to know about a stolen vehicle is ""Where are the keys?"" The idea that hot chicks hang out at a drive-in for local race drivers instead of texting their bff all night is old school and made me ask, ""When was this film made?"" Dino is a great philosopher, ""Forget the past. It's history."" He also makes up all kind of ridiculous Anita puns. They also have an aircraft fly overhead for safety, i.e. let them know when there is traffic, but that information didn't seem to effect their driving as they sped through red lights in a cop-less town.

The personalities ranged from bland to bad. 130 minutes of mostly car action, not much in the way of building a believable tale.
A preteen or young teen film. A tad more believable than ""Death Race 2000"" but not nearly as entertaining.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. No sex. Male rear nudity.",1395446400,,1775,4.540625
5353647,4,B009NNM70G,"I LOVED this movie!  It's a great movie, just like Fast & Furious 6.

It's got all the best clches, it's predictable, and it's a ton of fun. You've got a love story, a need for revenge/justice, a road-trip, a group of wacky side-kicks, stunts that defy physics.

If you want something serious, go see Drive.  If you want to have a good time, watch Need for Speed.",1395273600,2,363,4.294117647058823
5353648,2,B009NNM70G,"At the age of 34, Aaron Paul is quite the accomplished actor  at least on the small screen.  You may catch him here and there in various roles, but for the most part, Paul is best known for his outstanding performance in the AMC drug drama, Breaking Bad.  For five years, Paul portrayed the quirky Jesse Pinkman, and earned himself several prominent awards, along with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  However, with Breaking Bad having reached its conclusion, it only seems like a natural decision for Paul to try his luck on the big screen.  However, not every successful TV actor translates well to the grander stage of film.  And, if Need for Speed is any indication about the direction of Pauls future in film  he might want to start rethinking his character choices

Directed by Scott Waugh (Act of Valor) and based on the popular Electronic Arts video game, Need for Speed stars Aaron Paul as a garage owner and former racecar driver, Tobey Marshall.  He, along with a handful of his closest friends, run the garage  but Tobey has a hard time finding the money to keep it open.  He occasionally takes part in street races for side money, yet its never enough to maintain a level of financial comfort.

After successfully winning his latest street race, Tobey and his team are approached by Tobeys old rival, Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper)  a famed driver and car tycoon.  Prior to his death, car creator Carol Shelby had been working on a special, supped-up version of the Shelby Mustang, however, he wasn't able to complete his work.  Brewster enlists Tobey to complete the Mustang, at which point he will pay them a quarter of the cars worth  between two and three million dollars.  But, egos get in the way and during a street race between Tobey and Dino  tragedy lands Tobey in jail for a crime he didn't commit.

After doing time in jail, Tobey openly breaks parole and heads from New York to California  but not before enlisting the help of high-end car dealer, Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots).  She is able to lend him the same Shelby Mustang from his partnership with Dino and he plans to use it to race Dino in a private, invitation only winner-take-all street race  coordinated by an internet racing guru, Monarch (Michael Keaton).  Tobey also has revenge on the mind and plans to prove his innocence while taking Dino down in the process.

In the spirit of the Fast and the Furious franchise, Need for Speed attempts to establish characters with a heavy dose of racing in their backdrop.  Unfortunately, Need for Speed doesnt present a substantial alternative to the Fast franchise, featuring generic individuals that supposedly have credibility, egos, and reputations  but only because they are force-fed to the audience without substantiated proof.  Even the dialogue between the characters is bothersome, as they spend far too much time and effort rattling off bland one-liners and partaking in soap opera-ish melodrama.

For someone as talented as Aaron Paul, he is terribly under utilized in the lead role of this lackluster plot.  In fact, I dare say Paul is not ready to be a lead actor based on the result of this film.  He goes from a supremely popular television drama to a disappointing undertaking  and its hard to imagine a role of this nature helping him further his career.  His character comes off as a bit of fraud  and at times, his delivery is terribly fake.  Even Pauls alleged rivalry with the films villain, portrayed by Dominic Cooper, is dependent on false, over-embellished egos and the chemistry is just not there.  Obviously, most of us know Paul is a credible actor, meaning the writing is where the fault lies in this presentation.

Meaningful character interaction is completely sacrificed for the sake of adding a near endless about of car chases  inevitably causing more cut scenes of which the eye is able to keep track.  There are quite a few outstanding cars worth your admiration in this flick, including the decked-out Shelby Mustang GT500, plus the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, and Koenigsegg Agera R.  But, it obviously wouldnt be a racing movie until they were all prominently wrecked at high speed  except for the Koenigsegg, which is ridiculously important to the outcome of the far-fetched story.

Regardless of how this film plays our, the countless holes in the plot are undeniable.  In one particular scene, Tobeys team is traveling next to him in a truck in order to refuel his car, so he doesnt have to stop and lose any more precious time (as if it takes more than just a couple of minutes to fill-up).  In any event, mere moments later Tobey and his passenger, Julia (who apparently has nothing better to do than to go on joy-rides with convicts), randomly stop for gas.  Before, time was of the essence, but now its okay to stop?  Come on?  Seriously?  Naturally, theres a police office just happens to be in the gas station parking, who predictably chases them around for a few minutes.  Go figure.

Overall, Need for Speed as downright ridiculous in every possible manner of thinking  even more so than the Fast franchise.  In the real world, Tobey Marshall would have been quickly apprehended in OJ Simpson fashion, but the odds of him going to jail for his alleged crime in the first place is next to nothing anyway (since theres traffic cameras everywhere these days).  This terribly scripted film does a marvelous job of making decent actors look like daytime television actors  not to mention there is absolutely nothing about this film that drastically ties itself to the popular video game franchise (and video game film adoptions have a history of being terrible to begin with).  About the only reason you should see this film is if you're a diehard fan of Aaron Paul or simply like to see eye-popping, ridiculously fast cars.

This is a combination of Fast and the Furious and Cannonball Run but not as entertaining as either. There is your usual plotline, usual bad guy, so why the good guys even trust him in the first place blows my mind. I'm beginning to dislike movies where you see the characters about to make the wrong decisions all the time. The bad thing that will happen to a well liked character as it always is will eventually happen. Everyone wants to be in the big illegal race and will do anything to be in it. there are cars, races, prison and very defined good and bad guys and gals. Can I recommend it?

I loved the main actor Aaron Paul (he was phenomenal as Jesse in the Breaking Bad series) and I was happy to see him in a different role than his Breaking Bad days.  Even in a movie with so-so writing and plot, Paul still put in a good performance.  The movie does have some good action scenes and it will be a hit with kids who love racing, speed,and fast car or are fans of the Need for Speed video game, on which the movie was based.

I recently learned that it was based off a video game and directed by a very accomplished race car stunt driver. It was one of the less costly movies on AmzPrime to rent so I went ahead thinking, 'eh.. at worst I get to see Rami Malek in something other than Mr. Robot.'  [I'm a HUUUUUGE MR. ROBOT FAN!  HUUUUGE] At first it was a bit confusing with the cliche opening 'hometown garage scenes.' But it quickly picked up. I am prbly one of the 3 ppl on the planet that has yet to watch Breaking Bad (I'm sorry!!  I plan to rectify this immediately!). I say that only to say that I wasn't familiar with Aaron Paul as an actor. I can now see what all the buzz is about! He is really a natural to watch. The film may be a 'popcorn flick,' but it is certainly anything BUT cheesy!  I plan to re-watch tonight!  It was a fun film.",1475193600,,968,4.073684210526316

Obviously this movie was inspired by the Fast & Furious comedies... ...I mean action films... ...and probably intended as a cash grab for one of the worse companies in the world - Electronic Arts.

But somehow out of all of this, they came up with a movie that is filled with heart and soul, from the homegrown grease monkey following in his deceased father's footsteps, to the comradery of a bunch of young men who grew up together, to the tumultuous elegy-turned-car-race that consumes the second half of the movie.

I love the characters, most of which seem new to the screen (for me at least - I'm not much of a movie/TV buff) but all of whom seem to work so well together.  I love the cars - all while knowing that the stunts/scenes depicted throughout most of the film are ridiculously bogus and silly.  Ever watch a real car race?  They're boring as hell.  So of COURSE Hollywood has to doll 'em up a little.

Most of all I love the message - the conquest of a man who fights to the end despite all he's lost.",1474502400,4,1117,4.383495145631068

 Aaron Paul, now famous because of the hit TV show Breaking Bad has secured a starring role in this car race actioner.  Paul plays a man falsely imprisoned and bent on revenge.  He must win an illegal trans-continental car race while trying to avoid bounty hunters.  Paul has his big chance in a genre with a small natural slice of the viewing public.  Can he draw the eyes to the theater?
  Yes he can.  The $66 million budget for this movie returned a  very tidy $203 million at the box office.  Cadillac cars for everybody.

Believe it or not I was actually excited for this movie when it was being promoted. I am a fan of the car films especially the old school ones. Luckily for me this one was filmed like an old school one thanks to the people that were involved. So knowing that although not as much as I would learn from the Blu Ray I went into this ready for a fun ride. I am glad to say that this film was indeed a fun one.
The story follows a group of friends who of course race on the side to make that extra cash. When offered a job that eventually turns into a three way race our hero Tobey losses his friend to a horrible crash caused by Dino. Tobey spends the next couple of years locked up for the accident as Dino got away. Once released he is looking for revenge and there is a race coming up that may help out with that.

This is one of those turn off the brain fun summer type flicks that is also based on the hit video game series. Luckily for all of us the production team wanted this to be shot as real as possible unlike the Fast & Furious franchise. That means all of the car stunts were done in camera, no CG. Director Scott Waugh is a stuntman himself and comes from a family [or two, watch the special features] of stuntmen which of course he brought on has his stunt team. After his last film he directed Act of Valor I was excited to see his next, he did a good job here. Also the writers George and John Gatins did a good job turning this from game to film. This was Georges first writing gig but John has given us Flight and Real Steel among others.

Aaron Paul, Cooper, Keaton and all of them did  good job here as the acting was just what it needed to be for this type of film. But I have to say that the special features on the Blu Ray bring this title up even more. There are some great behind the scenes stuff including a feature on the two families that came together to make this that have basically been together forever. It is a really interesting look at these guys. Also we get a fun commentary from the director and Paul. This is a fun flick that is not meant to be taken that seriously.",1461801600,,2121,4.042857142857143

5354345,5,B009NNM70G,"Don't know what it is about this movie. It's far from Oscar worthy, obviously, but somehow the characters come together along with the driving sequences and deliver a live action version of one of my favorite games. I find myself stuck watching this movie everytime I find it on Showtime and now I'm actually recommending this movie to those people I know who love cars and the open road. See it. Like it. Hate it.

If this keeps happening I'll probably start buying my movies elsewhere.  I know yesterday I bought the last of the Hunger Games movies and paid $4 extra to buy it at Costco because I was afraid I'd be stuck with it in Amazon and then the trilogy wouldn't all be in the same place.
