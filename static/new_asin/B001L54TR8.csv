3678475,5,B001L54TR8,"I've been taking Kundalini Yoga classes on and off for the past couple of years and I have to congratulate Ana & Ravi on this excellent production. This is the best of the ""old school"" Kundalini workouts combined with Ana & Ravi's genius innovations which make it even better and cutting edge. The exercises felt like balm for my hips and joints. I worked up a sweat and I have to say, the way they present the workout imbues it with a high fun factor. Like someone else said, I felt that this one made me feel expansive and great, filled with star power!  I feel like trying out for something, and I'm not even an actor!  The upper body work is killer. My arms and chest and shoulders feel it in a good way. This dynamic duo has really outdone themselves with this great workout!",1235347200,12,780,4.335616438356165
3678476,2,B001L54TR8,"Lunges and squats - two things that absolutely kill my knees.  I was very disappointed that the ""meat"" of this workout included 17 minutes of exercises that I will have to skip because it had my knees aching for days afterwards.  This dvd reminds me of everything I hate about typical gym class workouts and traditional workout videos.  I absoutely adore the Fat Free, Warrior, Ultimate Stretch, and Yoga Body Beauty workouts from Ravi and Ana.  The new scenery, repetitive music, and assessory changes throughout the video were also very distracting to me.  I'm afraid this one will be gathering dust on my shelf. Very disappointed after waiting over a month for it to arrive.",1235347200,33,677,4.852173913043479
3678477,4,B001L54TR8,"I have several of RaviAna's DVDs and also took Ravi's classes when I lived in NYC.

I embrace the spiritual aspects of kundalini yoga, with the mantras and breathing exercises that make you work on your mind and magnetic field (aura) as well as your body. In this DVD, they emphasize these spiritual/esotheric aspects more than in the other two of their newest releases. But then, the kundalini tradition has always focused on beauty being linked to health, and radiance being a healthy glow coming from the inside of the organs and glands out through the body and the electro-magnetic field surrounding it.

This new DVD is an awesome energizing workout to get your superstar charisma out! They seem to really have put in a lot of work into the new DVDs to improve them. There are lots of new postures I haven't seen in the past DVDs. The pace is faster, which I like. It's not too fast.

In their previous DVDs I found the relaxation or meditatation moments after each posture in previous DVDs to be too long... sometimes the relaxations would feel longer than the postures themselves. Not so here.

The stretching exercises in the Radiance Warmup are wonderful. I'm very inflexible with the tightest muscles, but the spiral stretches gave me a new body for the day.

The Radiance Salutation section is VERY challenging. In two postures, you're pumping your arms for 5 minutes straight, but it feels like 15 minutes. But you feel like such a champion afterwards, like you can take on any challenge and feel totally centered.

I really like that there are pre-selected sets - if you're pressed for workout time, you can choose a set that gets your whole body covered, or even design your own workout to be as short or long as you like through the matrix option.

Some people have criticized that they didn't get the breathing techniques explained in previous DVDs. No worries, now there's a breath primer.

The production value has been taken up several notches. The music is way better! Don't feel anything is missing here. This new DVD by RaviAna is very cool - not quite as much of a favorite as their new cardio/stretch/strengthen one, but that's because my focus is to lose weight and tone abs and other muscles.

For artists/actors/dancers/public speakers: I think this DVD is PERFECT to do half a day or so before an audition or presentation. You'll feel like a star.

If you thought their past DVDs were great but too slow in pace or with too many similar postures, you'll be very happy with their latest ones.",1235347200,13,2519,4.704545454545454
3678478,2,B001L54TR8,"I looked forward to the release of Ana and Ravi's new titles very much, but have to say I am disappointed.
The workout is still a good one, but like what another reviewer had said, the background was very distracting and so was the inconsistent and roving camera. I also found the music too loud and the pace too fast.",1235260800,15,318,4.316666666666666
3678479,2,B001L54TR8,"I own all of Ana and Ravi's videos and can't say enough good things about them.  Sadly, I will be
a dissenting voice with her newest video.  Ana's new bleach job seems to have affected her judgment. She carries on like a yogic Barbie, throwing her hair around in her face during poses,
and changing costumes alternately with a pony tail extension down to her waist.  True, her body
looks great and more muscular but something feels amiss and very distressing.  Throughout the
workout, which is more like an aerobic fitness one, there is no sense of peace or graceful movements, no feeling of space between the moves.  Ana carries on, in a shrill and very high
voice, like some automaton wind-up doll.  This, to me, is very far from the Kundalini spirit.
Somehow Ana has transformed herself into some Barbarella of yoga and lost her way.

The production feels like a trainwreck.  The camera switches back and forth in a schizoid fashion,
not allowing the viewer to focus on the movements.  The music plays so loudly that you can
barely hear Ravi's instructions.  The pace is frenzied and chaotic, not leaving much time for
reflection.  There are few exercises with breath of fire, which is always wonderful and the
meditations did not feel calming at all.  The very artificial background screams for the
previous soothing white screens where we could focus on Ana.  I was sorely disappointed
and longed for the quality of their previous work.  Whoever is designing their production
hasn't served them well.

Like so many other people,  I have received innumerable benefits from following Ana and Ravi's
work.  I will stick to my favorites, Fat Free Yoga, Warrior Workout and Ultimate Stretch and
hope that both these wonderful people can get back to basics and drop the Hollywood
virus they seem to have contracted.",1235260800,24,1814,4.837662337662338
3678480,5,B001L54TR8,"I have a number of Ravi and Ana's DVD's and finally got this one from the new series. I did it for the first time yesterday and fell in love with it right away. I can't say that I like the new DVD's better than the previous ones--it's just that this series is different. First of all the setting is beautiful and so are Ana's vocals featured in the new music in this workout--in fact all music is new or remixed. This workout features more cardio--there are a couple of jumping segments, and more segments of long repetitive movements that challenge you in a whole new way--they are completely different from the previous core strengthening exercises in earlier DVD's. These couple of segments with repetitive movements are the most challenging portion of this DVD because I felt like my muscles are on fire and had to take a few breathing breaks --however I'm ready to see how far I can go today :o) Otherwise, the rest of the DVD is very beginner friendly. The new singing meditation at the end of this workout ""Adi Shakti"" made me smile the entire time, and I was literally dancing to it as I was sitting and singing. I felt glowing at the completion of this workout and entirely at peace. This one is definitely a keeper!!!",1235174400,6,1227,4.506726457399103
3678481,5,B001L54TR8,"I've done  all Ravi and Ana's DVD's and each one does something special for body and mind. After doing this one, I felt, just as the title says...full of energy and radiance. The exercises leave you feeling that way. It works your whole body and there are modifications for beginners. Ravi and Ana seek to help others have a better quality of life and this DVD succeeds in helping you radiate inside and out. It's definitely a bright spot in the world being so dark and uncertain these days. It gives you the power to find strength inside yourself and radiate beyond the state of things around you and in your life and rise above.

The DVD starts with the TUNING-IN as usual, followed by WARM-UP, which has a few spinal warm-ups, cat-cow warm-ups, then an exercise going from sitting on your heels to kneeling position. Then comes STRETCHING PLUS which has seated forward bend stretches, a couple hip openers and ankle circles while in a squatting position. Next, SUPERSET: squats, a lunge-type walk that works into Roman scissor jacks w/ breath of fire, stepping to the side working into jumping jacks with breath of fire, standing and bending touching opposite ankle, doing small kicks with the sound Har, alternate leg lifts in 8 breaths and movements lying on your back. Then, RADIANCE SALUTATIONS: an exercise of moving from sitting on your heels to putting your forehead on the floor with your arms behind you. Then TIGER CLAWS: raising and lowering your arms from the side to above you while sitting(done with a couple different ways of breathing.)(These last two exercise you do for several minutes...by doing them for so long, the exercise really gets inside of you and does it's work and the repetition of it put my mind in a trance-like state.) Going straight through, all this to this point was about 52 mins. It's followed by DEEP RELAXATION, a SOLAR POWER MANTRA chant, then ADI SHAKTI, which is singing a song. Last of all CLOSING PRAYER of course. It comes with the MATRIX option, so you can prgramme it any way you want for whatever time you want. Also, there are three pre-set workouts: QUICK TIME WORKOUT(29:00), A PRETTY TOUGH WORKOUT(63:00), and TOTAL ENERGY BLAST: 1 hr 4o min.). There is also a BREATH PRIMER.

The music is feel-good and radiates with a hip feel to it. All the exercises are new...there's only a couple that you'll have done before in the warm-ups if you're familiar with their other DVD's. I'm certain you will find it very beneficial and uplifting...not to mention great for your body! I've been doing Ravi and Ana's yoga for sometime now, and I'm in the best shape I've ever been and the smallest size. Their yoga really works wonders and it just happens naturally from doing their yoga...I've talked to others who do Raviana yoga regularly and they say the same thing...that they've trimmed down even if they weren't really trying! Not only that, but it's great for your internal health. And that's just it...it works from the inside out, which is why I think it brings such great results. It heals inside, so of course you are going to feel it and see it outside!(sorry this review is kind of long...I hope it's helpful...I thought since there aren't many reviews yet, I'd be more detailed.) :)",1234915200,45,3239,4.729203539823009
3678492,5,B001L54TR8,"This review will have a two-part format. In the first part, I'll describe the contents of the DVD as well as my thoughts on them. In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance has the matrix menu, which allows you to customize the length of your workout. All exercises in this DVD are done equally on both sides of the body.  Please note that there are a lot of new and different exercises in this DVD, so my explanations below may not always be adequate.  I did the best I could with as few words as possible!

Tune In (1:52): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Yoga Radiance Warm-Ups (7:12): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*While seated, grind your stomach in circles
*With your arms at right angles, flex your spine and arms back and forth
*Sitting with legs crossed, lift alternating arms up and back
*Short cat-cow sequence
*Add sitting back on your knees, then rising, then sort of diving back to cat/cow position (kind of have to watch this one to see what I mean)

Yoga Radiance Stretching Plus (8:42): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Seated with your legs and arms out in front of you, lean forward and back
*Bring one leg in so your foot touches your other thigh, then lean forward over the extended leg, then repeat on the other side (you do both sides multiple times)
*Seated with your feet wide, tilt your knees one direction, than the other
*Same as the previous exercise but add a lifted arm with each tilt
*Still seated with your legs wide, stretch to the side with an arm overhead
*Legs still wide, lean forward (this is a longer stretch)
*Squat on the balls of your feet and circle your ankles

Energy & Radiance Super Set (17:53): This segment consists of the following exercises.  Please note: I'm not thrilled about Ana's form with the squatting exercise.  Her knees go out too far over her toes.  It is generally recommended NOT to put your knees so far forward when doing squats.  Please also note that if you don't feel up to the jumping jacks, you can continue the slower, lower impact leg movements.

*Squatting exercise with your arms forward (this is repeated movements, not a static pose)
*Alternate lunges back with one arm folded in to your chest
*Turn the previous move into a scissor-style jumping jack
*Step out side-to-side, with your arms going up, out to the side, down, and back out to the side
*Turn the previous move into a jumping jack but keep the arm pattern
*From star pose, alternately touch your feet with the opposite hands
*Stand with hands on hips, kick each leg out (low) and say the sound ""har"" with each kick
*Repeat squats
*Step out side-to-side, with your arms going forward, then to the sides and up
*Turn the previous move into a jumping jack but keep the arm pattern
*Hold star pose for a short time
*Repeat the kicks with ""har""
*Lie on your back and raise alternate legs incrementally in time with an 8-count inhalation and exhalation

Radiance Salutation (9:30): This set consists of only one exercise.  Sit on your heels with your hands clasped behind your back.  Bow forward and touch your forehead to the ground while raising your arms high behind you (still clasped).  Then return to your start position.  I was not able to do this on my knees the whole time and had to switch to sitting cross-legged.  Listen to your body and do what your body tells you; don't force anything you think you'll regret later!

Tiger Claws (7:30): This set also consists of only one exercise.  Sit cross-legged with your arms extended, parallel to the ground.  Raise your arms so your forearms cross in front of your forehead.  Keep your hands in rigid claws the whole time.  This is quite difficult and I had to take a break partway through.  Between this and the radiance salutation yesterday, my shoulders are killing me today.  So you've been forewarned.

Deep Relaxation (6:22): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen to Ravi. The music here is a little up-tempo for relaxation.

Solar Power Mantra (11:41): I'll put the chant here, then discuss the segment a bit more below.

Har Har Har Har Gobinday
Har Har Har Har Mukunday
Har Har Har Har Udaray
Har Har Har Har Uparay
Har Har Har Har Hariang
Har Har Har Har Kariang
Har Har Har Har Near Namay
Har Har Har Har Akamay

When you say ""har,"" you move your hands close together as if you are going to clap.  When you say the other words, you bring your hands into prayer position.  However, for the first couple of almost-claps, the camera is sort of jerky and you can't see Ana's hands.  It's a little annoying but gets better as the segment goes on.

Adi Shakti (5:25): This is a second mantra on the same DVD.  Not a lot to say about this one, but here is the chant:

Adi Shakti
Adi Shakti
Adi Shakti
Namo Namo
Saraba Shakti
Saraba Shakti
Saraba Shakti
Namo Namo
Pritham Bhagvatee
Pritham Bhagvatee
Pritham Bhagvatee
Namo Namo
Kundalini
Mata Shakti
Mata Shakti
Namo Namo

Closing Prayer (1:12): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

Breath Primer: Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do a breath in eight parts (four equal parts breathing in and four equal parts breathing out), long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique.  I think this is the exact same segment as was included with the Solar Power DVD.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the newer ones with the concrete floor, white pillars, fake nature background, and blonde Ana. Both Ravi and Ana narrate and Ana demonstrates the poses and movements.  The music is a little bit all over the place in this one.  There's some of Ana singing, some that sounds like more traditional Indian music (which I personally love, and which helped get me through the radiance salutation segment), and a little bit every now and then that sounds like it came from one of the ""older"" (dark-haired Ana) DVDs.  I like this music a lot more than what appears in some of the other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs.

I don't care for the camera work in certain parts of this.  It seems to jump around randomly.  But it's only like this in a couple of places.  In other places, it's not noticeable.  Ana's outfit does change in the middle of one set, then back again.  This bothers some people but I really didn't mind.  I just figured they either filmed the sections at different times and spliced them together later, or maybe they filmed each segment multiple times and chose the best one to include.  I, personally, don't find this distracting.

There's almost no static stretching in this DVD.  I've done the Energy & Radiance Super Set every day for about a week, sometimes with the high-impact jumping jacks and sometimes without (those are a little harsh, first thing in the morning), and I will say this - I do feel energized afterwards.  You may also want to drink a big glass of water after finishing this DVD.

Normally I would offer a warning about doing too much cat/cow every day if you have wrist issues, but it's very short in this DVD and hasn't been causing me any trouble at all.

I think a lot of this DVD would be good for beginners (except Radiance Salutation and Tiger Claws, which would be better for someone who was more advanced). So you will have some room to grow and/or challenge yourself by adding in these segments as you get better.  Ana and Ravi do offer some suggestions for modifications of certain poses.  Finally, don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace.

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular. (I intend to include a version of this in all my reviews of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs.)

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has star pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD contains a fair amount of mantra chanting - there's are two separate chanting segments, as well as the opening and closing segments. Whenever there are mantras, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives and use the matrix menu or your DVD remote to skip the chants. (I happen to like the chants, but that's just me.)

With respect to calorie-burning, this DVD is probably a little more intense than some of Ana's and Ravi's others, with less stretching and more active movement.  But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of excessive instruction later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do a movement; you know it by this point!

Unlike some of Ana's and Ravi's other DVDs, few health claims are made in this DVD. Take those that do appear with a grain of salt. I do find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues.  At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

If you are struggling with a sequence, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1378684800,9,12538,4.512378426171529

If you are really looking to improve your health, lose weight or simply explore this art of Yoga take my advice and give their DVDs a shot, I bet you won't be dissapointed, they are better than any instructor led class.

3678494,5,B001L54TR8,"I believe this is the #1 Kundalini DVD series out there.  This DVD definitely renergizes and gives you a bright spark.  I discovered this Kundalini Yoga Series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh on Amazon about 2 years ago and it is incredible.  I have been doing casual yoga of various sorts here and there via DVD and at the (Hatha, Kripalu, etc.) over the years but this series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh fundamentally changed my approach to wellness, fitness,  personal growth and outlook on life.  I was totally new to Kundalini Yoga and, frankly, a but skeptical about it since it has some ""unusual"" moves and poses and chanting compared to other forms of exercise and Yoga I have done at the gym and via DVDs.  Now I see the power of Kundalini via Ana and Ravi ""technology"" that integrates physicality, mindfulness, and spirit.  It is not easy at first - but that is the point.  You do what you can, dot judge yourself and you reap massive benefits.  I progressed quite rapidly from things I felt were impossible but worth trying to not so hard to challenging to ""not hard any more"".  I feel GREAT every single time I complete a DVD - -my mood, my body, my creativity, my stress, my mind clarity, my stamina, etc.  Its truly amazing.  The key to reaping these benefits is to not get caught up in saying ""this is weird"" but to say ""just try it and see how you feel"".  Incredibly fit and wise people did this type of yoga and meditation hundreds and thousands of years ago as a regular regime but Western society has somehow made it non-traditional and inaccessible.  Many other types of Yoga focus too much on the body and physicality and don't see the mind, body, spirit interconnection like Ravi and Ana.  Ravi and Ana make it so accessible - combining direction on how to do the poses and breathwork and sounds (mantras) that vibrate your body to heal it, strengthen it and give new clarity.  Ana demonstrates the poses (don't be intimidated by how easy she makes things look - just do your best is what I found) and Ravi and Ana explain the physiological basis of how each pose affects your glands, nervous system, muscular system. Brain and energy and spirit.  Ravi has amazing poetry sprinkled in to make it just a beautiful relaxing experience (even though its quite physical!).  The production is very professionally done -- different angles, alternatives if you have certain issues or challenges, music editing, pacing, etc.  I totally recommend any of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's to anyone whether you do Yoga already or not.  It can truly take your fitness to another level along with your outlook on life.

3678495,5,B001L54TR8,"So great!
You will radiate positive energy after doing this work-out.
It's my ""go to"" yoga class on DVD
:)",1363305600,,106,4.35
3678496,3,B001L54TR8,"I am a big fan of Ravi and Ana's, have all their DVDs and work out to them every day. While all their older DVDs, the ones where Ana has dark hair,  are a very solid 4 or 5 stars for me (and I will take the time to write those reviews, to be fair), I cannot rate their newer, blond Ana DVDs more than 3 stars.

The problems (for me) with the blond Ana DVDs include:

- Loud, screeching, jarring, overpowering music which detracts intensely from the feeling of well-being and relaxation induced by the older DVDs. This is particularly annoying because I love Ravi's soothing voice, and Ana's cheerful voice. In the newer DVDs I can barely make out what they are saying amidst the cacophony. I cannot emphasize enough how disappointing this feels in comparison to the beautifully serene aural landscape of previous DVD's. I feel I'm missing the experience, I'm missing the instructions and I am also missing Ravi's wonderfully Yodaesque commentary. (I know the latter is not everyone's cup of tea, but I seem to get a lot out of it when I can actually hear it).

- Too many fake-looking elements ruin the visual aspect of this and other blond Ana DVDs. The artificial look goes against the very spirit of yoga, whose goal is to dispel delusion. In this sense, the white warehouse setting of the first DVDs was much more appropriate. Yes, I know, kundalini yoga is mostly practiced with eyes closed (although there are also many kriyas that call for open eyes). However, we all need to look at the screen often to check what Ana is doing and try to imitate and keep up, don't we? The same with meditation mantras, I need to read the screen until I commit them to memory; I suspect others do too. And it is a DVD, so I think it fair to comment on the visual aspects. The photographic backdrop depicts a ""serene sea landscape"". Of course, because it is a photo, the lack of ripples in the water create a frozen, highly artificial look. The (I suspect) plastic Buddha adorning the practice area is rather incongruous in a yoga context and potentially alienating to folks who prefer to think of kundalini yoga as disassociated from any religion. If they are going to go with religious symbolism, Sikh paraphernalia would have been more appropriate. Ana's hair (platinum blond with really long extensions) often changes styles within the same exercise which, added to the faster pace of this DVD, makes for a dizzying experience. (By the way, I'm sure Ana is telling the truth when she says she was born blond - many people are blond as babies but often their hair becomes darker as they get older. Platinum blond is not, I suspect, Ana's natural hair color now, judging by the intensely contrasting color of her eyebrows). Ana is beautiful no matter what and if she and Ravi could go for more sober production in future videos, I will learn to appreciate the blond tresses or whichever style/color she chooses next.

- My main concern with this and other blond Ana DVDs is the faster pace and sketchy instruction which, coupled with  rather more complicated exercises, makes for a very frustrating experience. The camera work has also taken a page out of music videos and sequences are constantly interrupted so I barely have time to see for two seconds what Ana is doing with, say, her legs, before I'm given a close-up of her face, which makes me lose track completely. Guys, please, this is not MTV.

Ana, Ravi, I saw on your Facebook page that you are working on the audio for three new DVDs. Please guys, I work in a prison, my life is stressful, the dark-haired Ana videos are my oasis that I return to everyday to invigorate, soothe and replenish myself. It would mean a lot to me if you could go back to your original philosophy and aesthetic values with future DVDs.",1332633600,12,3768,4.5816023738872405
3678497,4,B001L54TR8,"I was excited to try this DVD after reading so many rave reviews.  Ana Brett truly is radiant and inspiring.  At first I was a bit taken back by the bare skin, but I actually found it helpful to see her form so clearly during poses that were new to me.  And when I see how lean and toned she is it keeps me motivated to stick with the workout.  ;-)

I'm new to Kundalini so I can't compare this to other teachers, however I have dabbled in yoga for years.  The first time I did the DVD I went for it and did the hour routine.  There were a few points during the video when I thought I would die because the routine was so challenging (`tiger claws' especially). For the next 2 days my glutes, shoulders and quads were quite sore, which I consider a good thing.  Since then I've also tried just  10 and 15 minute selections when I wanted to squeeze in a quick pick me up.

I really like all the inspirational and motivational quotes that Ana & Ravi say throughout the routine.  They make me happy.

Each time I do this DVD I truly do feel radiant and friends have commented on how glowly I look(!) - I even received a compliment from a stranger that I was beaming!  Even though I dread the `tiger claws,' I woke up every morning the last 2 weeks cravings this DVD.  Writing this makes me want to go home and do it right now!

I definitely recommend it and look forward to trying other DVDs by Ana and Ravi.",1306886400,4,1405,4.113970588235294

WOW!

Well, firstly, let me tell you a little bit about my Kundalini journey so far. Prior to discovering Kundalini Yoga I had practiced Hatha Yoga (a beautiful practice) for approx one year. My practice is now Kundalini and for over a year now I have had a regular morning practice. It was like I had found what I was looking for when I started doing the DVD's, I resonate completely with it....it was like something clicked into place. I have a good library of Kundalini DVD's that I rotate throughout the week and have also a growing library of books including some by Yogi Bhajan....so inspiring.

Anyway on to the review!

Set with a colourful background depicting ocean and green landscape, buddha, lotus flowers...I found the production to be visually pleasing and of good quality. The sound and accompanying music I also found to be good quality, the music is uplifting and inspires me to keep going, or if I need to stop to start again when I am ready :)

There is a good menu of options which include a matrix where you can design your own class to suit your needs on any given day. There are a good selection of pre sets to choose from and these have clear descriptions of how difficult they are likely to be eg for beginners and for intermediate and a real challenge. Also you have the option of simply 'playing' the DVD class through which is a good option too.

To begin with there is Tune in via mantra and this is set to some music which I thought was a nice touch.

Next is a good set of warm ups and includes
sufi grind
cat cow
cat cow variation
piston variation with arms raised.

Stretching set includes
Rag doll
Row boat
seated side stretches
seated side stretches using arms
legs wide while seated on the floor and side stretch
legs wide while steated variation stretching forward and deep breathing
squat on balls of feet and rotate both feet one way and then the other way (really nice!)

Energy and radiance set includes
alternate from standing postition into a seated squat position
standing coordinating arm and leg movements (cardiac..good!)some breath of fire used with this
variation on standing coordinating arm movements (cardiac..good!) some breath of fire used with this
Standing in a starfish pose, legs apart arms raised to the sides...deep breathing
Standing with legs apart and arms raised to sides lower opposite arm to oppostie foot and repeat on other side
Stand and meditate for a short period
Stand with feet approx hip width apart, kick out alternate legs and chant the mantra 'Har'
alternate from standing position to a seated squat
Standing coordinating arms and legs (good cardiac)
starfish with deep breaths
Stand with feet approx hip width apart, kick out alternate legs and chant the mantra 'Har'
lie on back, alternate leg raises..breath in 8 parts whilst moving leg up and out in 8 parts while lowering leg

Radiance set
Sit on heels (or in easy pose) with hands interlaced behind back bow forward, raise arms, sit up and then this kriya continues for a good length of time....I really, really enjoyed this I felt so tranquil and meditative

Sit in easy pose, extend arms to shoulder level and have hands in claws (like a tiger)raise them up over your head in the shape of an arc and back to shoulder level to the rhythm of breath of fire. Near the end the tongue is enxtended from the mouth and then returned and the breath held and then released. This is a real test of endurance! I had to stop and restart quite a few times but it is something to work on :)
enjoyed it!

Relaxation
Lying down on back with arms and legs apart, palms faced up in Savasana....lovely

Meditation
solar power
adi shakti
Beautiful meditations, among my favourites

To close
final prayer
Tune out via mantra

This class was amazing! Ana demonstrates beautifully and both Ana and Ravi encourage throughout, the instruction is clear and I am very comfortable with their way of teaching, gentle and inspiring! I feel wonderful, radiant, energised and very very happy when I have done this class............a class I will treasure and work with often!

Thanks to Ana and Ravi

3678499,2,B001L54TR8,"Review Update January 2011:  Its been a while since I tried this video and decided to give it another chance.  I have to say that I still feel the same way.  While these guys are great and do a lot of great work, and while the exercises on this video are good, the noise in the background is just too loud and distracting to relax.  I wish you could turn the music off.  And the matrix part of the workout is not well set up, as it does tell you are going to do something and then you don't.  I'm actually put off now of buying any of their new videos, as I'm afraid it will be formatted like this, with the loud non-relaxing music and the create your own workout that doesn't match up.  I may end up just sticking with the old ones, which are all great.

Old Review June 2010:  I have lots of Ana and Ravi's older dvds, use them all the time and love them, but this one seems that it was rushed into creation as they did not fine tune it to work out the quirks.  When you use the design your own workout option, they did not perfect it, as it starts telling you  that you will do an exercise at the end of some sections and then it switches to something else, instead of doing what you were told you would do.  The music is a little on the loud side, so you really have to strain at times to hear what they are telling you to do over the music.  One part of the music sounds like cars crashing into each other with screeching brakes, which is not relaxing. Its also a little distracting with Ana's hair changing styles throughout the video (I'm guessing the ""hair stylist"" recommended that, but it is very distracting).  Some of the workout feels more like an aerobics workout than a yoga workout.  I also feel like it is a little too ""hollywood,"" like they are ""selling out"" to appeal to more people (with the hair styles changing and fancy backgrounds and loud music).  The picture of the ocean behind them looks nice, but its a little weird with Ana's hair blowing around like there is an ocean breeze when it is a picture behind her.  There are some new exercises though, which is good.  I recommend that they redo the video so it works better and either turn down the music, or add the option, like some aerobics videos do, where you can listen to the music or not listen to the music, as sounds of screeching brakes in the background does make you lose your relaxation concentration.  I recommend that you pass on this video and get one of their older videos, like fat free yoga, a journey through the chakras, ultimate stretch or the warrior workout.",1275609600,7,2558,4.25879917184265
3678500,5,B001L54TR8,"This workout works!!!!!! Get ready for a fun and exhilarating workout. Anytime I feel I am lagging in the radiance dept. I pop this one in my player and in 45 minutes (more or less depending how I program my workout with the matrix) I am a million kilowatts lighter and brighter!!!!!!!!!!! Okay others have complained that this workout does include a section of Yogic Lunges and squats (it's short but they are repeated twice just like you would for strength building) but I am ecstatic with it because these two things are the only things that are proven to really change the but and thighs and they make me feel like I am burning calories double time throughout the rest of my day! This is another great mix of strengthening, stretching with an awesome music mix - one of their best yet!.I absolutely adore every single one of my Ravi/Ana dvds (other faves- Fat Free, Ultimate Stretch, and Yoga Body Beauty, and the 3 latest are awesome!!!!)",1271894400,4,943,4.619047619047619
3678501,3,B001L54TR8,"My review of this DVD will say much the same as my review of Ravi and Ana's ""Kundalini Yoga Cardio, Stretch & Strengthen.""  That's because this DVD is very similar to the other DVD.

What I liked about this DVD:

**the different music.  It's still new-agey, but with a faster beat. Several other reviewers don't like the music, but it didn't bother me.

**Ana is radiant and glowing, as always.  She is a joy to watch, in spite of her swinging blonde ponytail.

**Both Ravi and Ana give instruction.  I love hearing both their voices.

**how I feel after doing this DVD.  Like with their other DVDs, I feel calm, yet energized and happy.

What missed the mark on this DVD:

**the odd choice of scenery.  The workout is filmed against a backdrop picture from Hawaii (or maybe California).  It looks totally fake.  The lotus blossom and Buddha sitting in the corner look out of place.

**the seemingly endless meditation sections.  The Radiance Salutation (7 minutes) and Tiger Claws(6 minutes) are torture for me!  Then, to do the Solar Meditation for 11+ minutes is more torture!  It would have helped if Ravi had explained more about these meditations and what they are supposed to do for you.  Meditations of this length are for advanced practioners and this DVD is not geared to the advanced person.

**the matrix doesn't work.  You can select maybe 3 sections and then the selector freezes.  I enjoy doing the breath primer before I start the workout and it would be nice to be able to seamlessly include this with the matrix, instead of having to stop and start the DVD.  I no longer use the matrix.

**Odd and inconsistent camera angles.  It's nice to see the poses from  different angles, but several poses must have been filmed at different times.  One part of a move shows Ana sitting lengthwise on the mat, the camera then switches to Ana sitting cross-wise on the mat continuing the move.  This may have been because of the re-editing they had to do, but if this wasn't the case, this is very distracting and to me shows sloppy editing.  Yes, the poses flow, but it's distracting.

This DVD has a place in my collection, but I would recommend that any of their older DVDs are a better choice.",1271548800,7,2203,4.600515463917525
3678502,5,B001L54TR8,"Although I prefer some of the older raviana DVDs, AM/PM being my favorite, I find this one seems new and fresh. In features some new moves, a beautiful set and my all time favorite Kundalini yoga mantra ""Adi Shakti"".  Overall this is a great yoga class and I highly recommend this DVD. The only thing I personally did not like was the music that went along with the ""tune it"". I found it to be annoying and distracting.",1265155200,,419,4.371794871794871
3678503,5,B001L54TR8,"Since i was used to hatha yoga, when i first tried one of their Kundalini dvds, i did not like it at all, and was thinking,""what the heck is this? this isn't yoga at all.""  but after giving them another try, i have purchased a handful more and do them every day, as soon as i wake up.  The results were definitely noticeable after only three weeks, and i feel great and happy.
  as far as this one in particular, it is one of my favorites! the first time i had to do all those jumping-jacks (okay only 30 seconds worth, a couple of times), i had a tough time, but by the third time i did the workout, i felt i could have gone on forever!
  Kundalini is especially great if you have been injured or have weak wrists like i do, because i find that it is not as demanding on your joints as hatha yoga can be.
  If you really want to feel great, give this one a try! sat nam:)",1264982400,8,872,3.971264367816092
3678504,3,B001L54TR8,"I discovered Kundalini yoga last May and have already bought 10 of Ana and Ravi's older dvds and I use all of them, happily rotating them though out the week. This one ""Energy & Super Radiance""-my recent purchase -has wonderful exercises and energy but I have a hard time with their sound system.

Whenever Ana or Ravi speak, their voices sound like they are coming through a loud speaker and have that tinny-in-a-vast-empty-auditorium sound which isn't relaxing or pleasant to me. The music (which I think is great) also has that tinny sound without a depth to it (maybe they accidentally turned off the bass) and when the music is on, it competes loudly with Ana and Ravi's voices, instead of complimenting their voices as I feel the music does on their other dvds. Again, it's not the music I dislike, it's the sound of this dvd and the way it was mixed. After I get used to the exercises, I will turn the sound off which is a shame because I really enjoy the sound on their other dvds.",1264896000,4,989,4.4944444444444445
3678505,5,B001L54TR8,"Once again, Ravi and Ana have created a practice that feels very complete.  I do feel activated energetically after, and I feel the radiance of the inner and outer levels of working with breathing and dynamic postures.

This DVD reminds me of the Total Fun Fitness DVD because of the set that contains repetitive, dynamic standing movement that appears to be typical of the Kundalini practice style.  I must say I don't love that kind of work and it doesn't feel very calming to me, but it does help my stamina and that's a great benefit since I do the Raviana practices to push myself further than I would on my own. It also has the same surreal looking outdoorsy setting.  (I actually prefer the practices and look of the Dance the Chakras/Yoga Beauty Body/Fat Free-Lose weight videos).

I feel like I've given my body a strengthening practice without endless sun salutes--another huge plus for me since vinyasa classes feel taxing on my wrists.  The radiance salutation is unlike anything I've ever done--I work through resistance every time!  But I love that it feels devotional and spiritual.  The tiger claws also kicks up resistance but engages the upper body strongly and I do feel the ""magentism"" shift as Ravi mentions.  The kundalini energy is indeed moving by the end.  As usual, I like the closing prayer/devotional practices which are my favorite parts of the DVD in addition to the intense breathing that also activates my energy.

I've been doing yoga for over 18 years and am an instructor so I appreciate Ravi and Ana diving into the practice, but therefore I would not recommend this for beginners. I also at this stage of practice appreciate the more esoteric elements of practice addressing the ""energy body"", ie aura and magnetism.  Ten years ago this tape would've been pure torture for me!  But now I think it's a worthwhile practice that allows me to work deeply.",1264636800,9,1888,4.790123456790123
3678506,5,B001L54TR8,"This dvd and the other two that came out at the same time have a different look from older ravi and ana dvds.  If you are as attached to the old ones as I am, perhaps it is off-putting at first.  I suggest trying it a few times because sometimes change is difficult.  If you are new to ravi and ana, I suggest buying this dvd as well as an older title like bliss hips, yoga beauty body, etc.  For around the price of a live yoga class, you can't beat the value of these dvds.  This particular one is a great all around workout with beautiful ending meditations.  I am 4 months prego so I keep going with the low impact version of the standing movements rather than shifting to the higher impact version which works really well for me.  I also shorten some of the difficult movements if I feel I need to.  I highly suggest this dvd and the others perhaps excluding the naval power sets for pregnancy.  You can find advice about practicing pregnant on their website: [...]  It is a super duper way to keep your tension down and positive energy up.  Ravi and Ana do a beautiful job of bringing classic Kundalini sets to us infused with their own style and energy. Can't wait for the three new dvds.",1263254400,2,1195,4.266666666666667
3678507,5,B001L54TR8,"I was impressed by this DVD.  The new format is refreshing.  There are some good cardio sets that remind me of physical education at primary school - the scissor jacks.  Whereas some people may criticise these cardio sets,  i must defend the DVD by saying that we don't get to stretch like that in our everyday living as adults.

The traditional background music pieces for the Radiance Salutation and Tiger Claws is a nice change.  It feels very Kundalini and reminds me of the origins of this yoga.  Tiger Claws is an amazing exercise.  With practise and perseverance i can now complete the exercise properly and i've noticed a good change in the muscle tone in my arms.

The Warmups and stretching at the beginning of the DVD are also very effective.  I find that i'm learning about kundalini yoga as Ravi and Ana's DVDs continue to inspire me to research.  I've learned that the mantras are potent, especially the Solar Mantra at the end of the DVD. I also really enjoy the soundtrack during the deep relaxation on the DVD.  It's inspiring, peaceful and happy.

the things i did not enjoy:
-  Yes, the new background set is nice, but not as nice as the plain white background in Raviana's older DVDs.  This one is a little distracting.

-  Ana's ponytail hairstyle does not look natural or appealing in this DVD.  It's a pedantic observation, but when one uses the same DVD often, these little things stick out prominently.

other than that, the content is new and good, especially if you already own Raviana's older DVDs.  I just wish they'd take the content and maintain the plain white etheric set.  It was easier on the eye.
I still give it 5 stars.",1263254400,2,1657,4.587030716723549

These have literally changed my life by taking my health and fitness to a whole new level. A lot has been said about how challenging some of the exercises are. It's true but what's different about this style of yoga (Kundalini) is that the exercises are all accessible to the average person. You might feel sore the next day, like I do, but even that feels good!

Some people have complained about the music. I personally prefer a more lively style of music as is on this tape, especially for a yoga workout that's upbeat and fun. It adds drama and helps carry me through all of the tougher moments. I hope they keep making workouts excactly like this and the others I've tried.",1252886400,2,791,4.455172413793103
3678511,3,B001L54TR8,"Great video as usual from Ravi and Ana. Wonderful workouts, it has a long segment on tiger claws though which a lot of people will have to work up to. It's very rejuvenating though.

I would give this DVD 4 stars because it isn't as good as their other DVDs, and 5 stars compared to other yoga DVDs because their DVDs are phenomenal and some of the  best! Overall though, compared to their many other DVDs I have, I do not even use this, not only because of the music, but the quality of the workout is not even close to as good as their other DVDs. Wish I could get my money back.

I gave it 3 stars because of the horrid nauseating repeated AWFUL music that makes you want to tear your hair out. I LOVE the music on their other DVDs, and I can bear with not so great music, but music that makes people nauseous? Come on guys!

DO NOT hesitate to buy one of their other DVDs though (not the newest releases though). If you don't mind the music, this is (as usual) another phenomenal workout.",1252800000,5,992,4.178010471204188

Yogi Bhajan always said ""Keep up and you'll be kept up"". I liked the fact that there were modifications for various fitness/agility levels; and I think you will too. I was ""flying"" for the rest of the day. Kundalini Yoga is the bomb!",1252454400,3,438,4.27710843373494
3678533,5,B001L54TR8,"Some of the reviews for this don't do this justice. This is one of the most amazing yoga tapes I've every done and here's why: 1. Kundalini Yoga is the only yoga system which truly has an aerobic component, through its use of breath and  movement. 2. Unlike so many yoga tapes which are a regurgatation of the same old thing, Kundalini Yoga is definitely something new and exciting in the yoga world. 3. I really appreciate that Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance is exactly what the title says. Kundalini Yoga doesn't just pay lip service to a concept (in this case energy and radiance) but gets beneath the surface and works on so many levels. It's obvious that the authors really know their stuff. 4. People don't seem to understand that yoga is more than just physical exercises, it's an inner experience of Self. All of the Ana & Ravi workouts are more than just workokuts, they're an Experience. Bottom line: if you truly want to experience energy and radiance make the investment and get this.

I love the new set and music. I think that some of the reviewers below don't understand Ana & Ravi's motivation, which is to inspire people to make the transition from fitness to yoga. The only way to do that is to have a modern look and feel to their programs. I have taken Ana & Ravi's workshops and they could care less about glitz. I believe that they have created these programs with a higher purpose in mind: to give people who already do yoga, and also people who normally wouldn't be interested in yoga, something which will inspire them to transform their lives. These new DVD's are so relevant to the times we live in. There are some challenging exercises but overall they're accessible to anyone at any fitness level. The Matrix Menu option let's you program the exact workout you're in the mood for, and there are also pre-sets if you'd like your workout to be under an hour.",1250640000,3,1125,4.4396135265700485

I also happen to like the music which is a kind of Indian Alternative rock. Very cool!!! And it is very inspiring at just the moments you need a little extra to carry you through.
The yoga and instruction still rock and does exactly what you want a phenomenal Kundalini yoga practice to do for you! This will work you on all levels. Its more intermediate then some of their others but any level could give it a try.

This DVD is pretty glitzy featuring interesting set design and Ana's blonde hair blowing in the breeze.  Sometimes the music detracts from the Yoga.  I am a bit let down by this one because some of the exercises are somewhat like the old aerobics exercises from the 80's.  I just did not feel ""relaxed"" or invigorated by this particular offering by Ana and Ravi.  So sorry to have to say that.  I am purchasing other of their DVD's, though, because they are the absolute best.",1250467200,7,612,4.3628318584070795
3678537,3,B001L54TR8,"First of all, I'm going to highlight my gripes about this dvd, because all the good points have been pointed out enough in other reviews.  I bought all 3 of the new dvds a few months ago.  The music of Yoga for Beginner's and Beyond annoyed me so much I didn't make it through 15 minutes of it.  Someone described the music as a techno/hip hop/yoga music twist, which I think sums it up pretty well.  It's annoying enough to detract from the actual yoga routine.
  I'm a huge Ravi & Ana fan - I love their DVDs, I feel SO much better when I do them.  I have been disappointed with the new dvds, though, mostly because of the production.  My general feeling is that they have tried to go for a more mainstream crowd with these ones, trying to generate users that usually would normally find yoga ""slow"" or ""boring"".  The routines themselves are more athletic than the older ones, and would be enjoyable if they weren't so atrociously overproduced.  When you have nonstop weird techno yoga chants, and even accordion music, much of the yoga ""feel"" is lost.  These are overstimulating.  There is a spiritual aspect of yoga.  Part of what made their older dvds so wonderful was their elegant simplicity, the chance to unwind, to get away from the general ""noise"" of modern fast-paced life.  Don't expect that here; go to their older dvds for that.
  Now, as for this DVD, it's a lot of fun, challenging, and fast-paced.  Out of the 3 new ones, this is my favorite.  I was eventually able to somewhat tune out the music, which is more than I can say for the other dvds.  It's a great, energizing workout; if it had been in the older production style, it would be one of my favorites.  I would say, if you are considering buying the new dvds, buy this one first, and see what you think.  If you are considering buying ANY of Ana and Ravi's dvds, buy one where Ana has black hair; those are Ana & Ravi at there best.  These ones are Ana & Ravi selling out.",1250467200,13,1949,4.370473537604457

This is a great workout on all levels. The high point for me was the Tiger Claws exercise which goes on for quite a few minutes. It's great training to learn to persevere and be timeless in your tasks. Ana is fun to watch and an amazing athlete.

Though, what is up with the music?  At one point, it's like a mix of hinduism and hip hop.  Not a good combo.  Then there is the music segments that sound like I dream of genie, a mix that sounds like sirens/alarms, and I'm pretty sure that you could sing ""Lowrider"" by War at one part.  Oh so weird.

Also, the background.  I understand that it is suppose to be tranquil, but if they want to have an outdoor background, they should be outdoors or at  least find a place with big windows overlooking the water. It looks like someone made it on SIMS.  It's very fake looking or f you are going to have something like that, make sure it looks real, ie. have the water moving,leaves rustling in the breeze, something.

I'm a yoga teacher and the renewal I feel after doing this workout with her is amazing! I also take many of these moves into my classroom and teach them to my students and they love it as much as I do. You have to try Kundalini! Whether you do a little to begin with or all of it at once, you'll feel renewed and refreshed! I highly recommend it!",1247097600,,442,3.922222222222222
3678542,5,B001L54TR8,"wow, wow wow.  I have been working on this dvd for the past 2 months, 3 times a week along with my spinning classes.  As always, Ana and Ravi have created another great dvd that helps me to balance my energy generated from the more aerobic intensive spin classes.  This particular dvd  has a fast pace to the movements that is aimed to generate an increase in energy, but is done in such a way that it harnesses the energy to give you greater inner strength, which I have noticed physical endurance exercise does not do.

What I love about this dvd is the section on meditation techniques, which I now use at any time when I feel my stress level creeping up.  The relief is instant and it is important to be be reminded that when you generate energy that you need to channel it in the correct way, otherwise it can be destruction.  hence, again, kundalini yoga really teaches you these important lessons.  Again, I am very biased as I have all of Ravi's and Ana's dvds and have applied their teachings of kundalini yoga into my daily life as part of my overall growth.  This dvd is focused on generating energy ..so be fully present that the movements are faster and longer than some of their other dvds.  All movements are low impact so even if you are not that fit, you will not feel left out in the moves .. just take a breather and come back to it; before long you will be following it and noticing an improvement in your movements.  Thanks Ravi and Ana, I love this one.  this dvd is both great for a beginner and someone who is familiar with Ravi and Ana's approach (although I do not need to preach to the Ravi and Ana followers :-))",1245456000,,1640,4.306188925081433
3678543,4,B001L54TR8,"I love MANY of the Raviana's dvds and I have most of them. This DVD is pretty good BUT is not my favorite Raviana DVD; However, it still has a place in my collection!

I got a pretty good workout with this, especially on the Superset segment, where Ana includes kundalini style squats & lunges! I found the Tiger Claws segment very challenging. This is where you move your arms up and down from the side for quite a long time... I think this exercise is more mental than physical.... yes my arms were burning a lot but you also need the mental strength to complete this segment. The music on the workout was great!!!!

Overall I liked this DVD... the reason why I gave it four stars is because Kundalini Yoga Cardio, Stretch, & Strengthen rocks and I enjoy it better than this workout!!!! This is a good Kundalini practice though :o)",1245196800,,833,4.437908496732026
3678544,4,B001L54TR8,"Kundalini is ""the onda"" in yoga. It helps you to balance your body, mind and spirit, it helps you to feel better, it gives you radiance, and self confidence, and boost your immune system.

The rest of the dvd is great too...not too tough, great when your energy is low or you need to get into the NOW now.  This one does lift you up...but has a nice balance to bring you back down and ground you.  It is an interesting sequence that will surprise you.  Try it, you will likely like it!  I sure the heck did and still do.  Ana does such a great job...and oh, duh...all three of these new dvd's have such beautiful chants after the deep relaxation and before the closing prayer.  Love em!",1243382400,,654,4.391666666666667
3678546,5,B001L54TR8,"This is my favorite of the Ana, Ravi videos.  It begins with the usual tune up and tummy rolls and goes into a wonderful side to side arm spiral exercise  that I really feel in my sides and core.  Both of the floor work sets are brilliant and can tone you up even without the standing portion.  That said, I adore the Kundalini style squats and lunges in the standing set.  I have weak knees but I feel the squat/chair sequence in my core as well as my thighs and booty, not in my joints.  I do keep the jumping portion however (jacks ,Roman scissors) at the low impact level most days.  With the arm movements this is fabulous cardio.  My favorite ""navel power"" move is the leg lift 8 breaths up, 8 breaths down sequence.  I have had 2 c sections and this move is very effective for that difficult area below the belly button. I haven't mastered the radiance salutation yet.  This is a bowing exercise done on your knees with your shoulders pulled back hands clasped.  I alternate days  with the tiger claw ;  A humbling move to say the least of constant arm movement arcing over your head for several minutes!  Be prepared,  This workout will sharpen  your intuition and strengthen your perception!  Last but not least 2 beautiful mantras, one is for self actualization and life breakthroughs, the other for harnessing creative peaceful energy calling on the divine feminine energy.  I'm turning 40 tomorrow, however most people think I'm in my  late  20's.  Thank you Kundalini and God bless Ana and Ravi!",1241913600,3,1508,4.573033707865169
3678547,5,B001L54TR8,"This review is really for Kundalini Yoga and especially Ravi and Ana.  I have tried several styles of yoga on and off for about 15 years.  This is the one for me!!  I  have been going through a really rough time (aren't we all?) and this yoga saved my life, sanity, spirit and it's fun!

I am finally the person I know I am supposed to be thanks to this yoga with the meditations, chants, and physical exercise.  I have a wonderful relationship with the Divine Creator now, I am happy and healthy!

If you want/need to change your life, soul, and body this is the best way to do it.

Get the beginner DVD first and then get them all.  Each one is awesome and each one will help.  I love each one I have but some are more physically demanding than others.

You won't be disappointed if you stick with it.  Remember, ""one more forever (because) the end is endless""-an abridged quote from Ravi Singh.",1241308800,4,897,4.3053892215568865
3678548,5,B001L54TR8,"Out of the three new Ravianas, this ranks as my second favorite, behind Stretch, Strengthen and Be Stress Free.

First of all, I love the music! It is so happy and calm and so far above any music you find in a workout DVD. Next, I love the sequence of exercises. They are so familiar and yet so unique. I find myself smiling while doing this one! Yes, there is some jumping around, but Ana clearly says you can stay low impact (which I do).

I feel like I do ""shine like the sun"" when I'm through!

I have lost 16 pounds working out with Ravi and Ana DVDs ... try this; you won't be sorry!!",1240704000,3,590,4.068965517241379
3678549,5,B001L54TR8,"Well, I have all of Ana's DVD's.  That being said I am overweight, plus size.  This is a wonderful DVD, my heart was pumping and I felt like it was a good workout.

There is one thing I didn't like.  The jumping.  Not really used to that and it can be hard for plus sized people.  I modified with a jog in place.  At any rate I love this DVD, great for the mind.  Helps me handle stress better, great for weight loss, and it does wonders for my figure.

I think it's nothing short of amazing what Ana's dvd's do for weight loss.  When I do one hour of her yoga  a day for three months I lost thirty pounds.  I think it helps us stress eaters.  I did advanced step for three months and didn't get ten percent of the results I had with this.

So, for those of you who are overweight try Ana's DVD's fantastic and don't be afraid to modify the poses if need be.  You'll be amazed at how fast your body changes.  I used to body build so I was amazed at how quick I got a slim compact muscle tones on only ana's dvd's./  PS.  I'm plus sized again cause I went off the wagon.

3678550,3,B001L54TR8,"I almost rate this a 1 or 2-star.  The yoga is fine, but the music is HORRIBLE.  It is extremely distracting and choppy.  If one could turn off the music, but keep the voice track that would be great.  I like the music on other Raviana DVDs, but truly think this is horrid.  It seems like the only things missing were some hip-hop and country swing.  Even though the yoga is ""real yoga,"" the music track makes it seem like they are trying for some exercise club gym feel which I do not like at all. The camera work jumps all over the place; and weirdly, her hair changes many times in the dvd with extensions, etc, and i think the clothes change, too.  It's all too artificial and cheesy.  Too bad; their old stuff was great.",1240012800,7,725,4.240875912408759
3678551,4,B001L54TR8,"I have the first DVD (Beginners and Beyond: different from the new one, I've learned.) I also have Fat Free. I got this one as my third.
Ana is interesting. Beautiful! I think her hair is awesome! A nice suprise. Loose the switch/fall or whatever it's called. Too fake and that doesn't go with who she seems to be. Just from one woman to another.
The important thing is the workout and what it does for each person. I do like the cardio, the hard work. Tigerclaws puts you in your place! WOW~ I love it! The work out seems to go by fast. I think it's because the meditation sets are very short compaired to what I'm used to, but it works here. It further separates it from the other two DVD's. I feel ENERGETIC when I am done. I do my workout from 4:30 a.m. to 5:30. One day a week I have to get to work an hour early and I don't work out. I definately feel it. I feel like I can't get going. Sluggish...spacy. This week, I will do fifteen minutes worth..I have to!
I hope this helps. I lucked out starting yoga with this couple. They are absolutely wonderful and giving of their wisdome. They share their experience wonderfully. Different is good!",1238457600,4,1148,4.270642201834862
3678562,5,B001L54TR8,"This DVD was a pleasure from start to finish. Ravi Singh and Ana Brett are great at finding new ways to feel good. While the exercises are accessible, they challenge one's coordination, strength and stamina. Lots of bowing and arm movements bring energy to the higher chakras where the higher emotions reside. Enjoy.",1238284800,2,316,4.981132075471698
3678563,5,B001L54TR8,"As already mentioned, the set is beautiful. It brings on a feeling of joy and serenity as you move thru the exercises. Ana is beautiful, too and I so enjoy learning the poses and moves from her. She certainly inspires me to do my best! I have all of their dvds, so I was certainly surprised to see how different this one is from their previous ""old school"" approach.

The best word I can use to compare the new workout to their previous dvds is energy.  The workout seems to be more upbeat (including music) with an increase in standing poses and movement.  Now I feel like on days when I want a mellow kundalini workout, I can rely one of my older KY dvds, but when I want to kick it up a notch and feeling motivated, I can pop this in and get a great workout!  I feel like this way I am doing some cardio and KY and getting the best of both worlds.  If you are like me and sometimes want to do some cardio, but it means sacrificing a KY practice, then you're in luck since this dvd offers both! It is challenging as there are some LONG segments, but then again, I am glad that it is a dvd that I can grow into.  For example, when I can do Tiger claws for 3 mins and then work up to 4 and then 5 minutes, I feel wonderful inside.  I am happy to be able to see that I am improving!

 I love that they labeled each section and the matrix helps you decide how long your chosen workout will be.  You can really see how they put their time and heart into the entire flow of the dvd.  I am glad that they kept some traditional parts (tune in, warm-up, deep relaxation, and closing prayer) and introduced some new poses and mantras.  I like that there are 2 mantras included. I often would  sing the Adi Shakiti mantra from their other dvd, so I was delighted to find it here!  All in all, Ravi and Ana did a wonderful job in showing another side of Kundalini yoga and providing a total body workout.  It's fun to do and it puts a smile on your face.",1237680000,3,1944,4.052356020942408
3678564,5,B001L54TR8,"I bought this about a month ago, and have been doing it about three times a week (I switch it up with hiking and  Raviana's other great DVD's). I have had a really fun, enlightening experience with this one. I really love the Pre-set selections that it has as an option. I use the 60 minute one so that way I KNOW that I am getting a good workout.
 My favorite part of this DVD in particular is the 'Radiance Salutation' where they have you on your knees with your arms behind you, hands grasping another and you bow continuously for eight minutes to this really inspirational, upbeat music. At first I thought that they were crazy for making it so long, but the benefits are astounding, and it became my favorite part quickly! Afterwards you meditate, and ""go deep."" I love it so much I have done it most everyday since, even if I am using another DVD or hiking I will put it on to this selection. There are many other great postures on this DVD. The music is great! And as everyone has said, Ana looks amazing and the new set is beautiful.",1237420800,10,1041,4.3061224489795915
3678565,4,B001L54TR8,"Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance! is one of three new DVDs from the husband/wife team of Ravi Singh/Ana Brett. As with their previous videos, the workout features Ana alone on screen while she and Ravi take turns providing voiceover instruction. However, gone is the plain white studio and the furry little rug; here Ana uses a traditional yoga mat, and she practices on a raised platform, surrounded by columns and against a painted backdrop of a tranquil lake scene.

The Main Menu of this DVD reads as follows:
*Play DVD
*Chapter Selections
*Design your own Workout Matrix Menu Option
*Matrix Tutorial
*Pre-Set Selections

With these new DVDs, Ravi and Ana have offered a Matrix; this option allows you to customize your own workout by selecting any of the chapters in any order (up to 15 total) to create your own yoga practice. Each DVD also has Pre-Set Selections which provide a variety of additional routines. The Pre-Set practices on this DVD are as follows (includes times in minutes):

Quick Time Workout (Also Good for Beginners)(29:00)
A Pretty Tough Workout (Intermediate Level)(63:00)
Total Energy Blast (Highly Ambitious)(1hr,40m)

Here is the Chapter Selection breakdown (includes times in minutes):
*Introduction (1:08)
*Tune-In (1:52)
*Yoga Radiance Warm-Ups (7:12)
*Yoga Radiance Stretching Plus (8:42)
*Energy & Radiance Super Set (17:53)
*Radiance Salutation (9:30)
*Tiger Claws (7:30)
*Deep Relaxation (6:22)
*Solar Power Mantra (11:41)
*Adi Shakti (5:25)
*Closing Prayer (1:12)
*Breath Primer (5:26)

From the Tune-In through the Closing Prayer, the main practice is just over 76 minutes long. In the Warm-Ups, Ravi and Ana include moves familiar from their past workouts, such as stomach grinding.  The Stretching segment also included some familiar moves (eg, rag doll), but I loved the fact that Ana does some nice hip openers here as well.  In fact, I was really enjoying this practice until we got to the Supersets segment.  At first, Ana does comes in and out of a squat position (sort of a moving chair pose), which was fun.  However, she then goes through a series of cardio moves very similar to those featured in one of the other new Ravi/Ana DVDs, Kundalini Yoga: Cardio, Stretch, & Strengthen.  These moves began low-impact, but then Ana performs 30 seconds of high impact jumping jacks while doing Breath of Fire (BOF); this is repeated several times.

Following the Supersets are two segments which each require A LOT of endurance.  For the first, the Radiance Salutation, you start seated on your heels with your hands clasped behind you, then come forward and touch your head to the ground (sometimes known as rabbit's pose); you then continue for about 8 minutes total.  For the Tiger Claws segment, you are simply lifting your clawed hands overhead, but you are repeating this movement while performing BOF for over 7 minutes--I was only able to make it about 1/3 of the way through each of these sections.  The Solar Power Mantra and Adi Shakti songs (both sung by Ana) are nice, but after the prior two segments, both felt a bit too long to me.  Finally, the Deep Relaxation, Closing Prayer, and Breath Primer segments are similar to what Ravi and Ana have offered on their previous DVDs.

A few final things to note. First of all, the font used for the DVD menus, especially the submenus, is VERY small--so small, in fact, that I found it impossible to read the submenu selections on my 13"" workout room TV (although when I played the DVD on my computer, the text appeared clearer). Overall, I found this DVD is well-done, but I had mixed feelings about it--i.e., I really enjoyed the warm-ups and stretching segments, which I felt were the most similar to Ana and Ravi's previous work, but I wasn't as crazy about the rest of the DVD.  Still, I think this DVD will definitely find lots of new fans and will probably be well-suited to more intermediate-to-advanced kundalini yoga practitioners.",1237075200,3,3949,4.968133535660091
3678566,5,B001L54TR8,"This video by Ana & Ravi does not disappoint. Fabulous! Cardio, Stretching,Mantras, Relaxation. Love it! Ana looks even more beautiful than before, as if that were possible. Instructions easy to follow, I feel so good after completing the dvd. Keep up the good work! My health has soared since i've been doing your dvd's!!!!!",1236902400,6,325,5.037037037037037
3678567,5,B001L54TR8,"This DVD is like a deep-tissue massage for the entire body. My belly tingles during some of the exercises!

Two years ago I discovered Kundalini Yoga here on Amazon by reading the reviews, and I am profoundly grateful that I did; it's helped me change my life and my body in myriad ways. This afternoon while doing one of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, I found myself thinking ""my life is at its most peaceful ever. I'm content, yet ambitious and confident. I love my life, and I love this yoga!"" Yeah, I really have thoughts like that!

I am calmer, more focused, more able to dissect any adversity that comes close to me and sort of neutralize it. My body is more limber and graceful, and I feel a glow that comes from deep within. I wake tired some days, but still happy! Your body knows how good this is for you...and rewards you.

I started with Fat Free Yoga for Beginners and Beyond, and now own several that I rotate. I crave this new DVD; it truly operates on mind/body/spirit levels, enriching them all. Pretty amazing stuff... awakening me in new, and sometimes pleasantly surprising, ways. I can feel my whole Universe expanding.

I love it. And you will too.",1236384000,29,1161,4.488151658767772
3678568,5,B001L54TR8,"I have to say I think Ana looks amazing with her natural blond hair.
I really enjoyed the upbeat music which I could not get out of my head the entire day after completing the workout. The combination of the Radiance stretching, super set and the salutation set fell into perfect sequence. The deep relaxation after completing tiger claws is very welcoming and needed. I enjoy the new beat to the Solar Power meditation, Har...Gobinday is one of my favorites and this just made me love it more.
Ana and Ravi put forth so much love into this and their other new ones and it shines through.
Keep an open mind and enjoy this energetic workout which takes care of every aspect of your body and mind.",1236297600,2,695,4.480314960629921
3678569,5,B001L54TR8,"Like so many of the other reviewers I LOVE this workout. Although the exercises are challenging there is no dread factor at all for me in doing this workout.  (Could you imagine if they had us do Frogs for nine minutes?!) I have done it every morning before work since I received the DVD.  I have had to modify the last two sets since I found it little to hard to do them five days in a row right of the bat.  For now on  2 out of 5 of the mornings I do the workout, I do a really challenging ab/navel power routine during the Radiance Salutation set and then I put the dvd on pause and do the first part of the Aura strengthening set (108 Push-ups with one leg in air - 54 each leg) and then during the Tiger Claws set I do the last two parts. My changes challenge me but give my arms and back a little rest so on the other 3 mornings I can do the Radiance Salutation set and Tiger Claws along with Ana.  The matrix is great too and I could see myself doing the Radiance Superset multiple times to help me lose 10 lbs that creeped up on me this past year.  Great Job, Ravi and Ana!!!",1236124800,4,1084,3.94954128440367
3678570,5,B001L54TR8,"This DVD is fantastic. Each of the movements in the warm ups were great and could have lasted longer to make the set even more fantastic. Besides the radiance factor, also a great upper body workout/ focus. Ana/ Ravi's DVDs in the past tended to focus more on the lower body in my opinion, so it made this DVD extra special for me.

I also want to add how much I loved the music in this DVD.",1236038400,3,391,4.077922077922078
3678571,5,B001L54TR8,"In my opinion, this DVD is the best representation of Kundalini Yoga that I've experienced so far. What I love about Ana & Ravi's style is that they are so encouraging and the instruction is first rate, so you're getting the best of ancient and new: the depth of yoga with cutting edge fitness. You always feel with their DVD's that you're in good hands and before you now it you've completed an exercise which has taken you to a totally new level of personal breakthrough. With the Matrix Menu option, you can customize this DVD and work out for a week and never do the same workout twice. In this time of economic strain, I feel that this is a much better bargain than taking live yoga classes!",1236038400,6,696,4.403100775193798
3678582,4,B001L54TR8,"Many of the people before me wrote excellent reviews!!  With all the details broken down for you.
So, suffice it to say that I agree.
Great production, lovely new set.
More of a modern, mainstream flair in my opinion than their previous DVDs.
It's yoga, and you'll get a great workout from it too!!",1236038400,,298,4.518518518518518
3678583,5,B001L54TR8,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! I am so struck by so many things about Ana and Ravi's DVDs.....they differ from so many fitness approaches because they are just so much FUN while offering an excellent workout for the body and mind. Actually, I used to almost think of them as a guilty pleasure -"" can it really be this much fun to get fit and take care of my body and mind?"", but now I see the results in how great I feel, physically and mentally - they are so much fun and also so effective!

Many folks have done a great job of outlining the great features of this workout: so many options to choose something that works for the time you have available or the specific goal you're working with each day, fun, challenging movements, and fabulous chanting that lights me up, to name just a few, so I won't go into detail on those.

I did want to address some of the folks who had concerns - someone asked if the cardio work is actually Kundalini yoga. Ana and Ravi have said that Yogi Bhajan, the amazing man who brought Kundalini Yoga to the United States from India, loved the idea of dance and cardio as part of a physical yoga practice. In fact, he often said when done correctly it is a powerful form of Kundalini Yoga unto itself. Sweating in this way everyday optimizes the glandular system and blood chemistry and energy flows. So, yes, it's absolutely Kundalini yoga, even if it feels a little ""out of the box"".

Another reviewer was concerned about Ana's blonde hair. I, too, was surprised by it at first, but wanted to pass on that she shared in a recent newsletter that she is actually a natural blonde. After finding out that there are some harmful chemicals contained in hair dyes, she decided to stop dyeing her hair to the darker color she had liked before. I thought this was really great to know - she's human, like the rest of us, and just found out some information that made her decide to choose something different. So she's not trying to pull a Barbie! In fact, I think Ana and Ravi offer something so unique in their DVDs - they are authentically who they are, and show us that it's possible to be fabulous and great and filled with fun in life! This DVD really wakes me up out of the low-grade ""ugh"" kind of feeling I have sometimes - you know how sometimes we all go around complaining about things and forgetting about the amazing blessings in front of us? Well, I really do feel radiant, great, and filled with the fun authentic ""me"" to offer in the world after I do their DVDs. I remember how many blessings I have and how I want to be great and fun and kind with others. When I did this fabulous DVD, I was reminded of this well-known quote, from Marianne Williamson: ""Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate, but that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, handsome, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us. It is not just in some; it is in everyone. And, as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our fear, our presence automatically liberates others.""

As many other reviewers have said, especially as I hang in there and prove that I'm stronger than I thought I was through the Radiance Salutation/Tiger Claw movements (or rest if I need and then continue), and with this whole DVD, I truly feel that I can cultivate and let my own light shine when I do this great practice. My husband thinks I should add (although this is already so long!:-)) that he loves to hear me laughing and singing as I'm doing the DVD, and that's proof for him of how great it is. I can't recommend it enough! Enjoy!",1235865600,11,3954,4.412328767123288
3678584,2,B001L54TR8,"I also was disappointed in this DVD.  I am a little confused as to what it is about...is it a cardio/yoga class like the ones offered at the gym? or is it kundalini yoga? I'm leaning towards the cardio/yoga gym class type.  The way I feel is that if I wanted a cardio workout I can go for a walk, a run, or jump around my house for 30 minutes which is kind of what this routine felt like.  I own all of their DVDs and I was expecting somehting much different.  Does anyone even know if this could be considered kundalini yoga?? I wanted more of a workout that works from the inside out...this one seems to focus on the outside too much..i'll try it a few more times and see if I change my mind..",1235779200,12,695,4.0510948905109485
3678585,4,B001L54TR8,"This is a challenging yet rewarding work out. With classics like jumping jacks,scissors,and knee bends done ala Kundalini. Wonderful meditations at the end and as with all the Ravi/Ana Dvd's great music.",1235779200,2,203,5.375
3678586,5,B001L54TR8,"This workout is both fun and challenging. It got my heart rate up, had me sweating, and stretched and strengthened my body from head to toe. The music is upbeat and kept me motivated. There is only about three exercises that have been in previous workouts otherwise it is all new material, and very excellent material I might add. I like that there are more standing poses in this one and I really love the addition of the squats 2x. This workout is pretty much non-stop and the time just flies by.

The Radiance Salutation and Tiger Claws are very challenging. I cannot finish them both yet as they are quite long and my arms get so tired they feel like they are going to fall off. But I will keep at it and hopefully one day be able to finish. :) After doing this workout only a couple of times my arms already feel much stronger and that motivates me to continue to challenge myself on my yoga mat and in my daily life.

This DVD is an excellent addition to my collection. I really love the music on the previous DVDs but the music on this is a nice change and just adds to the variety. The deep relaxation also seems to be a little longer than in some of the previous workouts and who wouldn't like that? ;)

The Adi Shakti mantra at the end was so uplifting. I was singing and smiling and I couldn't help but sway a little with the music because it just felt so good!",1235692800,7,1372,4.2091254752851714
3678587,5,B001L54TR8,"I have been practicing KY with Ravi and Ana's practices regularly for several years and enjoy them all.

Kundalini Yoga For Energy and Radiance  - no matter how much I try to think of the practice itself, the thing that I always remember more than the contents of the practice is the how it leaves me feeling afterward - absolutely radiant, without exaggeration. I remember trying KY for the first time many years ago, and that's how I feet then - but hadn't been able to recreate this feeling content, radiance, empowerment quite to the same extent until i tried this DVD.
It's definitely very unique practice - lots of new moves, and a lot of variety.
The DVD starts with usual Warm-ups and Stretches which some unique new moves to open up the hips and hamstrings and upper body. Some of the new variations are so graceful and almost dance-like, I was definitely having a lot of fun with those.

The we begin the Radiance Superset - a very invigorating mix of exercises, including even jumping jacks and scissor lunges with breath of fire. Ana suggests low-impact modifications for those who might prefer them. Definitely a very energizing set.

There a very tough (in my opinion) segment follows - Radiance Salute  - where you do this one move for almost ten minutes, it's the same one as on Dance The Chakras - the last yoga exercise - that was very tough! I am sure it must be for a reason - in this segment you are pretty much on your own, Ravi makes a few comments about testing your will power before we start, but then it's just music for the rest of the exercise - I guess you are supposed to overcome negative emotions on our own. I had to say, I got frustrating at one one point, but just kept going and then it passed. I'd never seen a KY yoga exercises done for such a long time in any of the previous practices, so I guess didn't expect it. I almost sort the DVD got stuck or something :)

Then there is another exercise which is done for about 7 minutes, i really like it - Tiger Claws where you cross your arms in front of your hairline to the rhythm of the breath of fire, very fun - they do help you with positive comments during this one :) which I appreciated.

Relaxation follows, and then two mantras - one is the same as on the Warrior DVD, but sung differently, and one other one for Compassion and invoking Feminine Powers, and that one I have heard as background music in Yoga House Call and Yoga Quick Fixes.

Overall, a great DVD, very different, but really excellent. Definitely left me feeling radiant and Energized.",1235692800,3,2547,4.415778251599147
3678588,5,B001L54TR8,"I did this dvd this morning and I must say that it reminds me of as someone here said ""old school kundalini yoga"" One reviewer said that this dvd is not what he/she is used to.  I say that this dvd is like what you see in the kundalini yoga manuals and I think that RaviAna toned it down a bit so as not to overwhelm viewers.  For example, in most kriyas, squats are done sitting all the way down on your heels and coming up.  Rarely are squats done half way, usually that is a modification.  To do them the traditional ky way, you can put a rolled yoga mat under your heels and make sure that your feet are forward and not out to the side.  Also the Har kicks are usually shuffle bounces.  I modified these exercises and you can too depending on your abilities. Also with the har kicks, RaviAna didn't mention that Har is pronounced ""hud"".  If you say it quickly it sounds like ""hudda"" with the tongue striking the top of the mouth.

I loved, loved the Radiance salutations.  This is actually an intermediate meditation.  The music for the salutation is the Jap Sahib which is one of the Sikh morning prayers.  It is a Bani (prayer)that describes the many characteristics of God (nameless, formless). When doing this kriya, try to keep the rhythm by bowing (third eye on the floor or pillow)on the Namastang or the namo words.  I have bad knees so I put a blanket between my bum and thighs.  I also have tight shoulders so I use a strap to pull my arms up.  Loved it.

The tiger claws exercise was the hardest thing I have done in awhile.  I wanted to stop but I kept say to myself ""victory, victory""  This gave my brain something to do to block out the pain.  What happens in long exercises like this is that your soul takes over and after awhile you don't feel your arms and your mind stops complaining, but you can't stop not even for a second.  This is the beauty of kundalini yoga to push you further than you thought you could.  I once had to do Sat Kriya for 31 minutes, never thought I could do it, but I did!!

To the disappointed reviewers who say that this is not kundalini yoga, I suggest that if your complete exposure to this yoga is through RaviAna dvds, then go the 3HO web site and find a ky teacher in your area.  Get out of the house and experience Kundalini yoga live!

My only minuses on the dvd were the mantra music.  I didn't like them so I downloaded Snatam Kaur's version of Har Gobinday.  It's free at spiritvoyage/mp3 downloads.  Also there is an Adi Shakti song is by Sada Sat Kaur.  You can download it at omstream. My new favorite Adi Shakti song is by Sat Purkh Kaur called ""Jai Ma"".  It ends with the Adi Shakti mantra.  You can download it at kriteachings.  There is also a video that shows the celestial communication (arm/hand movements) that go with this mantra.  Simply beautiful.  Otherwise great dvd.  Get it you will love it!",1235606400,22,2867,4.308988764044944
3678589,5,B001L54TR8,This is probably the most fun I have ever had working out. Period. The moves are very original. Its extremely relaxing and energizing at the same time. You feel amazing during this entire workout. Ana has perfect form. Ravi's queues are great. The color/ music scheme is wonderful. I don't want to ramble but yes. You should buy this. Yes you will like it. As far as I can see this video has no bad reviews. I used to be a huge fan of rainbeau mars but after doing this I think I am going to be sticking to Ana and Ravi from now on!,1235433600,5,532,4.076190476190476
3678590,5,B001L54TR8,"Such a wonderful way to begin the day with this Yoga practice. Since using this DVD, I am able to move in any direction all day long, feeling flexible and free. This video works all your muscles.

Some modifications may be helpful, like in the squat/chair sitting pose. You can use a chair with arms, and sit easily into the chair using your arms strength, rising and sitting. Lunges can be done sitting in a chair, each foot stepping back then each foot stepping forward going at your own pace.

I really hope people will honestly give this new DVD a chance. Yes, it is different from Ana and Ravi's usual Kundalini Yoga presentations. But such a wonderful workout.",1235433600,3,666,4.588235294117647
3678591,5,B001L54TR8,"Other reviewers have written great reviews about the details of this DVD, so I won't need to repeat all the wonderful options it has to offer.  Others have written review that I'm a little puzzled by, but we each have different takes on things.
I have practiced with this DVD twice so far and I find it very relaxing and energizing at the same time.
Because of the way the Matrix option is designed, the viewers have the ability to program the segments (over 10) in any order up to 15 in row. I'm not sure why someone would practice a section that hurts their knees or any other part of their body.  I am very careful when practicing and if something hurts I don't do it, but Ana gives alternatives to the vigorous movements.
I Tune In, then enjoy the Yoga Radiance Warm-up (7:12) and then I practice the Energy & Radiance Superset (17:59).  On days when I have time, I will use the Matrix and practice the Warm-Up, the E&R Superset two times in a row, then the Tiger Claws (7:30), and Deep Relaxation (6:32)
For a more relaxing practice you could Tune-In, and then practice the Warm-ups, Yoga Radiance Stretch (7:12), Radiance Salutations (3:32) and then your choice of the Mantra or Mediations and/or Relaxation.  I end each practice with the closing prayer, just because it feels good to send positive thoughts to those I love.
Ana's voice is beautiful during the chants and she and Ravi take care to make sure all exercises are explained well and alternatives are giving for many of the more vigorous moves.
You will feel a glow after practicing this DVD.",1235347200,5,1559,4.557142857142857

In the beginning, you may resent her cheerful, blissed out personality while she does repetitive movements that look easy, but make your arms feel like they will fall off.",1456272000,,272,4.571428571428571
8317270,2,B001L54TR8,"I have many RaviAna DVDs and like them very much. I do like the movements on this one, but I find most of the music so unpleasant that it stops me from using it. I'm okay with energetic music, but I wish it sounded joyful rather than hectic, urgent, and sometimes kind of negative/creepy. Also, as others have noted, the background is pretty unappealing.",1454457600,,354,4.546875

8317272,5,B001L54TR8,"Absolutely one of my favorite Ravi Ana DVD's!!!  I love many of their DVD's but this one is unique. It's more active, more cardio, more all over body movements. It's empowering to do it.  I modify the movements by the way. When the salutations come up and Ana bends her knees with her arms sticking out I step out to the sides and open my arms getting an upper body workout as well.  I also do other things...I may do a swimming motion as I go side to side or simply open up my chest to get an upper body stretch.  I love the ""Har Har Har"" meditation..I feel like a stronger person ready to meet my goals.  The meditations at the end are my favorite EVER.  I believe two of them you actually sing to (mantras) which I love. I love the tune of these meditations and how they make me feel. All of it is so positive, so wonderful..everything from the background to the ending prayer.  I am so glad I purchased this one. Definitely a bit different than their others.",1428192000,2,962,4.224043715846994
