8259143,1,B0015MO3PK,After searching for this 4 disc set on amazon I found it in my school book store for only $22.00 new and on other websites for under $30.00. I'm not sure why this is listed so high. Must be a mistake? The videos are very slow and a bit outdated FYI.,1398211200,2,249,3.9019607843137254
8259144,5,B0015MO3PK,"Magnificent series on oceanography.

 I had no idea that the theme could be so wondrous.
  And that the seas & sea-life could bring forth so many innovations.

  So many aspects of the science and beauty of the seas and
  sea-life covered.  Be astonished; and LEARN.
  And learn how scientists learn about the sea.....  Sincerely, F.B.",1397174400,,335,4.872727272727273
8259145,1,B0015MO3PK,"This is a waste of a lot of money, most of these videos can be found online, and are cheaper to rent per episode.  When selling this back you will not be able to sell it anywhere, except perhaps here on amazon.",1389139200,,210,4.0
8259146,3,B0015MO3PK,The video clips are short and concise. They are helpful for quick review. I use the review book with the videos,1361491200,,111,4.333333333333333
