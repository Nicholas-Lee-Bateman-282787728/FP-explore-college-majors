""Al Capone is an American icon because he still symbolizes today (eighty years later), the power of criminals to corrupt politicians and policemen.""

The above comes from this outstanding documentary about American gangster and Chicago crime boss Al ""Scarface"" Capone (1899 to 1947).

It examines Capone's personal history, lasting legacy, and unveils his unexpected connection to modern-day organized crime, law enforcement, as well as to popular culture from movies to rap music, and even everyday life in Chicago.

The menu chapters for this documentary are entitled as follows:

(1) The beginnings
(2) The rise
(3) The influences
(4) The hunt
(5) The fall
(6) The legacy

This informative film is mainly comment-driven with comments from people such as journalists, professors, historians, detectives, and writers/directors.  There are even comments from a former Chicago mob member (now a FBI informant), musicians, and Capone's grand-niece.

Finally, images in this documentary are in the form of black & white still pictures as well as black & white film footage.

In conclusion, for those who want to know the real story of Al Capone, this documentary is a must-see!!  The one main thing you should learn from this film is that the legend outlasted the man.

(2014;  55 min;  wide screen;  6 chapters;  PBS)

The hour flew by, the program held my interest, but there was little new to be learned here.

The several commenting ""experts"" were unfamiliar to me, yet the facts they offer seem accurate.
The closest this show comes to a celebrity is Al's grandniece, who says she once sat on his lap.

In this era of revisionist history, the role of Elliot Ness in finally laying low the notorious ""Scarface""
is downplayed, as expected. It's surprising however that none of Al's associates, not even Frank
Nitti, are given even a passing mention, nor are the many crimes Capone was allegedly responsible
for committing or ordering discussed. The concentration is on the man's fame and how he lost it.

We are told he was a celebrity in the Roaring 20s, that he integrated his nightclubs with star black
musicians and vocalists, like Satchmo and Lady Day, and that he was an occasional humanitarian.
Capone is cited as opening a Chicago soup kitchen during the darkest days of the Great Depression,
but this act of public largesse is negated by adding that the operation apparently didn't last long.

The turning point for this impeccable dresser who craved the spotlight and freely talked with ink-
stained members of the Fourth Estate came with the Feb. 14, 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
Gory photos of the aftermath of this machine gun slaying of seven mobsters were widely published,
and Capone's South Side Gang was, with good reason, believed responsible for this ""hit"" on ""Bugs""
Moran's North Side boys. Even though one victim survived his 14 bullet wounds, he never revealed
who he thought (or knew) was responsible, thus Al's culpability has never been definitively proved.
But the damage to his image was immediate and considerable, especially after the Wall St. collapse
of the following October. Now, fabulously wealthy mobsters like Capone were no longer admired by
Americans, many of whom were unemployed and struggling just to eat regularly.

More bad luck for Al was the Nov. '28 election to the presidency of Herbert Hoover, for the new Chief
Executive made Capone target #1. The resources of the Treasury Dept., plus its Chicago Bureau of
Prohibition subdivision, were employed to prove Capone was in violation of the Volstead Act, and that
he had paid no Federal income taxes. Ultimately the latter was Scarface's undoing. Athough the
prosecution's case was circumstantial and hung on the undeniable fact that Al showed zero income
for years but spent money like Farouk, that was enough for a jury of honest citizens to convict him.

He received a heavy 11 year sentence, was bounced from one Federal cooler to another, including
the recently opened Alcatraz, and when Capone emerged after about 8 years, syphilis had eaten
away at his brain and he had the intellectual capacity of a 12-year-old. He retired to his Palm Island,
FL. mansion, and was a recluse until a 1947 stroke, pneumonia and heart attack felled him at age 48.

If none of the above is new to you, see the second sentence of this review.",1408233600,,3085,4.898467432950191
