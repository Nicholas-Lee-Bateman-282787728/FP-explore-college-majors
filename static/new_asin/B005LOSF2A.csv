I can't think of any other artist that has ever released a recorded timeline of their life; especially one that is so raw and honest. This video chronicles the adventures through the good and bad times for over a decade in the life of a madman... the sex, violence and brutal truth is all displayed and inspirational to anyone who wants to make a mark on this planet.

P.S.... DVDASA FOR LIFE!",1411171200,,457,4.6419753086419755

8478357,2,B005LOSF2A,"After seeing Mr. Choe on the Howard Stern show lately, I decided to check out this movie. Simply put this is 90 minutes of pointless wandering, poor production, poor camera work, poor editing, and poor sound. It's just uninteresting and hard to watch, rambles, dwells on uninteresting scenes, and is confusing. This isn't a reflection on Mr. Choe's art or his story, it is just that the makers of this film missed the mark in most regards. I learned more about David in Sterns 40 minute interview than I did in this 90 minute movie.",1329955200,3,532,4.610526315789474
