8213101,3,B000UE64VK,"This show is a repeat; a redo; a takeover. And remakes are never as good as the original upon which they are based. It was first produced about 17-20 years ago. The Library remains the same but the benefactors and employees have changed--as well as the narrator (original was by the actor Jason Robards (spelling?) who has passed on. The original was shown only on PBS and never publically released as far as I ever learned. I lucked into perfect VHS copy made from the Master tape by a friend with ties to the New York Public. I love that 'original' show-I thought this at first was a long delayed public release. Its close-follows much of the same material and storyline but it isn't the same. The original conveyed so much about what a ""Palace"" for the people this institution is.. much of that being Jason Robard's narration-his voice adds so much ..But also from the energy of those initially interviewed- they simply conveyed so much more about this place and the place it holds in the hearts of many. Mary Vincent Astor has recently passed etc...they conveyed a love for this institution that just doesn't come out in this remake--but buy it anyway--there is nothing else out there on video as to the history of this People's Palace.

But at the same time--drop a line to the Library--ask them to release the original version--yes the President has changed (so please the current president and his ego and cut out the old president and insert some new footage. A slight edit here and there to update the story but most (95%) of the wonderful original would remain etc I imagine they wil scream the original is out of date-but it really isn't - not for those with a love for such institutions as people turn more and more away from books and into their 'instant' electronics--that group needs to see this--that group needs to see the original version and hopefully learn just how important Libraries, great ones no less, really are..The original simply blows this version away in showing just how important this Palace realy is--YIKES REPEATING myself, sorry--and yes the title is the very same ""The People's Palace"". I have since converted my VHS copy to DVD (thank you home computers and DVD burners) I wish I could just sell copies of the original on DVD on ebay at my cost or less - I'd gladly lose money to get the original released to the public..I have no interest in making money from it-just wish I could get the original version spread around-it is that good for Library Lovers.",1193788800,3,2494,4.668181818181818
