8570528,3,B00BLPKW2Y,Very disappointed with too much music in the background.  This is the first time that I have purchased a video that was produced by this Producer (Stoney-Wolf).,1392595200,,160,4.925925925925926
8570529,5,B00BLPKW2Y,"I saw this video trailer at the Iowa Deer Classic & I knew that this DVD would be better than other turkey hunting DVDs. Sure enough, this style of hunting is edge of your seat, nail biting, crazy action-packed fun! I've watched it twice so far and got a couple for friends of mine. Great editing & music along with in your face turkey encounters. Seriously, the best turkey hunting DVD out there. Nice work Turkey Reapers!",1364947200,,423,4.5064935064935066
8570530,5,B00BLPKW2Y,"I watched this video and I thought to myself,  hmmmmm.  I think I will try this. I enjoy sitting for long periods of time in the same spot. This video makes me want to move. Now after watching this I believe I will have the confidence to chase those dirty birds out in the open. One time I was able to chase a turkey and it did not escape, but they kicked me out of the store. Also, I think I will dress up in a suit and tie for this years hunt and bring a little class to the woods.  Ever watch finding bigfoot? I thought I saw a yeti one time in the woods. I wonder if bigfoot has written a manifeso on his hunting techniques.  I had a squirrel jump in my lap once sitting against a tree. I thought it was a bigfoot! However the squirrel was an advanced recon scout for the main sasquatch hunting party. My loud yell of surprise triggered a flurry of activity behind me. I walked back to my truck dejected from depriving a family of bigfoots from their turkey dinner. I went home, baked a peach pie and sipped a vodka martini by the moonlight. Godspeed bigfoot!  What an excellent movie for every hunter and sasquatch lover in your family!",1364947200,,1141,4.168181818181818
8570531,5,B00BLPKW2Y,"I bought this DVD at the Iowa Deer Classic and was shocked when I watched it.  These guys are crazy and kill turkeys all day at less than 10 yds out in the open. I can't wait for Turkey season to open so I can try this.  Very entertaining DVD, especially for a Turkey hunting DVD!!!  It's a must see",1364947200,,299,3.95
8570532,5,B00BLPKW2Y,"As a female hunter, I found this way of hunting intriguing. The graphics and music where great! Have to try it!",1364947200,,111,4.333333333333333
8570533,5,B00BLPKW2Y,I can't believe that my wife even watched this entire DVD!  I love the costumes and this is a MUST-SEE for any Turkey hunter or fans of hunting!  I never thought about crawling towards a turkey but now I gotta try this and see for myself!,1364947200,,238,4.1521739130434785
8570534,5,B00BLPKW2Y,"I was able to watch this video with my family and they loved it.  My dad (an avid and extremely experienced hunter) enjoyed the techniques that were used immensely.  There is no reason that you will not catch a turkey if you use the techniques in this video.  Non-stop action, great music, and good times.",1364947200,,305,4.509090909090909
