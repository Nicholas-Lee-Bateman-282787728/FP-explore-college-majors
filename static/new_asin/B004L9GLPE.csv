4400668,5,B004L9GLPE,"This is the three pronged tale of Marijuana Smuggling in South Florida.  The Movie is a classic Billy Corben (Cocaine Cowboys, The U) documentary.  He is a Miami native and a graduate of The University of Miami.

This, to me is part of Corben's documentaries giving Florida a much needed unique identity.  Not just the vacation place for New Yorkers,or a drug state (despite the two documentaries!).  Obviously this is not what the movie is about, it is about the stories of 3 communities in South Florida and how they brought in dope, and how it affected them and their communities.  He starts in Miami with Ethiopian Coptic Church, a very country part of the Everglades City that was dramatically changed economically by the enterprise and the Black Tuna Gang.  The reason for the title is revealed in the movie if you do not get the reference.

If you are interested in drug trafficking, South Florida, good documentaries or Corben's work, you HAVE TO watch this.",1312416000,,966,4.77710843373494
4400669,3,B004L9GLPE,"SQUARE GROUPER: THE GODFATHERS OF GANJA is a sometimes intense and always entertaining documentary that chronicles the beginning of the pot revolution and the gutsy South Florida smugglers of Colombian-grown weed.

Billy Corben and Alfred Spillman, the guys behind the terrific COCAINE COWBOYS series, have captured a vivid portrait of the pot culture along southern Florida's coasts during the 1970s and 80s.  ""Square Grouper"" is the slang term for stray bales of marijuana that Florida fishermen would pick up in the warm off-shore currents because they resembled the titular, box-like fish.

The documentary focuses on the infamous Black Tuna Gang, a bunch of savvy smugglers led by Robert Platshorn, the longest serving marijuana prisoner in U.S. history.  Another group: The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, whose members -- including kids -- smoked dope from morning till night and ran a gargantuan pot-dealing empire out of Miami Beach's exclusive Star Island.

And then of course there's Everglades City, a tiny fishing village 80 miles west of Miami with an audacious and bald-faced history of smuggling everything from endangered species to weed.",1311638400,,1153,5.418994413407821
4400670,4,B004L9GLPE,"In the 1970s, Floridians called the many bales of pot that were adrift in the ocean ""square grouper."" The new documentary, Square Grouper, tells three different stories about Florida's 1970s pot culture. The three stories are good - but vary in quality.

The first concerns the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, which started when a hippie traveled to Jamaica in search of pot. Eventually, this led to a network of hippies who claimed the herb as a sacrament. They bought a huge house in Miami Beach (to the consternation of their neighbors) and appeared on ""60 Minutes"" in 1979. This story is amazing - you can't make this up.

The second vignette was the sole disappointment. It concerns a group of pot dealers known as the Black Tuna gang. The former dealers are not contrite (about dealing, planning to ""take care of"" a judge, and trying to bribe a juror). In fact, they blame all of their problems on a government vendetta. The story is interesting, but I didn't like the Black Tuna people.

The final story sets the film back on course. Deep in Florida's backwaters lies the tiny fishing village of Everglade City. After the local fishing industry collapsed, many of the townspeople became involved in transporting pot; in fact, so many became transporters that - at one time - 80 percent of the men in the town were in the corrections system. Again, there are good stories - particularly about how the good ol' boys spent the money that they made dealing.

While I'm not crazy about the Black Tuna segment, Square Grouper is well worth watching.",1309219200,7,1548,4.743494423791821
4400671,5,B004L9GLPE,"If you ever wondered what happened to the Marijuana Church covered by 60 Minutes back in the 1970's - Square Grouper is the answer.  But it is more then just that planetary news on the religious marijuana movement.  There are two other major Florida based marijuana smuggling operations detailed in this documentary also.

What is most interesting is comparing the Square Grouper documentary with Cocaine Cowboys 1 and 2 which are produced by the same documentary team.  Even the two profit makeing marijuana smuggling organizations share the same rightous human values as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church members.  This is in marked contrast to the Cocaine Cowboys values.

So Square Grouper is not only a unique, valuable, indeed irreplacable documentation of our Marijuana reality.  It is also a chart to our future as we Senior Citizens come into our majority in a world that sees Marijuana as an answer to our energy problems as well as our spiritual and medical problems. We were right in 1968 to come together to ""Legalize It"", we are right now, and now the time is right for us also.

Don't miss what will be seen as a fundamental singularity to our understanding of our Hippy Marijuana values as they have matured over the past 45 years of growing and exploration.

4400672,5,B004L9GLPE,"I've been waiting to see ""Square Grouper"" since I first heard that Billy Corben (Cocaine Cowboys 1 & 2, Raw Deal) was directing the documentary. I became a Corben fan with ""Cocaine Cowboys"" and I've enjoyed all of his documentaries so far. What Corben does so well in his documentaries is that he infuses current footage and interviews from the actual people involved in the ""crimes"" with older archived footage and news broadcasts. These factors give his films such a realistic and edgy feel, not to mention authenticity provided by the first-hand sources including the ""criminals"", police, lawyers and FBI.

Knowing Corben's style, I went in to this film expecting ""Cocaine Cowboys"" with marijuana. This film is different though. It presents three separate stories, all set in the state of Florida (naturally, being a Corben film). The main difference in ""Square Grouper"" is that the pace isn't as fast as ""Cocaine Cowboys"". Much more mellow, yet still informative and imaginative. I find this fact very befitting the subject matter (or should I say, substance matter?).

The first story is about The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, who believe that marijuana is a sacrament, and the ensuing smuggling charges dropped on them. This part of the film examines the government's stand against a church centered around ganja. The media labeled them as a cult, they saw themselves as nothing but a church. Inevitably, the police become involved. The film begins with a verse from the Bible: ""Behold I have given you every green herb bearing seed..."" (Genesis 1:29) and I think this is a very important thing to consider for people who are against legalization (if you are a religious person).

The second story is about The Black Tuna Gang, who smuggled marijuana in massive amounts into Florida, or so the courts and FBI want you to believe. The film features the principle smugglers and FBI agents giving conflicting stories about alleged jury tampering, the Black Tuna gang's plans to flee, and even a phony plot to assassinate the judge in the trial. The Black Tuna Gang were dealt extremely harsh prison sentences, and this portion of the film tells the story from all viewpoints.

The third story is about the small town of Everglade City and the process of the citizens being practically forced to get into the marijuana business for much needed money. The tales tell of how easy it was to smuggle and hide drugs into the town, due to being able to evade the small police force in the swamps of the Everglades. To me, this is the most interesting part of the movie.

The film is accompanied by Country-type music, which I found to be a little off-putting, but otherwise, this is a fine documentary if you are interested in the topic, and I know that lots of people are. Billy Corben said himself that ""hip-hop fans MADE 'Cocaine Cowboys'."" I feel it should be noted that the music in the film will not grab the ""hip-hop crowd"" like ""Cocaine Cowboys 2"". Myself, I like all kinds of music, with the exception of popular country, and the country type music in this film didn't ruin the film for me, so don't let the music become the focal point of your viewing of this film. I'm not saying hip-hop music would be appropriate for this documentary, I'm just saying that the music won't appeal to hip-hop heads, many of whom are big fans of ""Cocaine Cowboys 1 & 2"". But like I said, I didn't find that it detracted from the film. It was just... off-putting.

The special features on the DVD include a short ""Touring Ten Thousand Islands"" featurette, deleted scenes, songs and scoring of Square Grouper (and music videos), along with feature-length commentary from Billy Corben and a trailer for the film.

So, while it may not be as exciting and fast paced as ""Cocaine Cowboys"", Billy Corben continues his successful streak of gripping and interesting documentaries. Highly recommended for heads, and I would also recommend this film to folks who are adamantly against legalization. It may open your eyes, or you could just be entertained by people getting busted if you're that kind of person. Either way, I think you can't go wrong with ""Square Grouper"". An important documentary. 4.5 stars.",1304035200,10,4188,4.840782122905028
