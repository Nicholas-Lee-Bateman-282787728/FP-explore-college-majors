8263320,5,B0016MWWW0,"I loved Capt. Lewis sense of humor, attention to detail and situational awareness. The preflight walk around was very interesting to watch. First officer Maria Cano was not only charming, but very competent as well. I just noticed on the LUX-SIN leg that ATC clearance was obtained during taxiing. Crew had a detailed explanation of aircraft systems and performed a course deviation due to weather. Nice presentation. Another great WAR DVD!",1350172800,,440,5.211267605633803
