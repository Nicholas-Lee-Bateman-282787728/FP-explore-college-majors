8230679,5,B000Y166BC,"Oh how I wish they'd reissue this in DVD. I still have a VHS player, but dread the day when this thing wears out. I have used Peggy Flores' maskmaking with PAPER video (by pausing and following it step by step) with every grade level from 1st to 12th with terrific outcomes from all classes. This one's a must have, using simple materials, which is why I wonder why they haven't updated it to a DVD.",1358726400,,399,4.2631578947368425
8230680,5,B000Y166BC,This video is a great step by step visual for art students in mask making with 3D form.  The video I received was in good condition.,1303257600,,132,4.076923076923077
