2522036,5,B000ELL1QC,"I can't believe that this series ended where it did, with no resolution. What was it? Lack of ratings or what? I have to admit, I didn't even know about the series until 4 years later, but I'd boil that down to poor advertising. There's all kinds of SHOWTIME advertising for junk like The L Word, Fat Actress and Queer as Folk. Anyone see an agenda here??? Too bad, because everyone I talked to enjoyed it. Maybe HBO will pick it up. We can dream, can't we?",1149206400,8,457,4.264367816091954
2522037,5,B000ELL1QC,"Before BSG took scifi into adult territory, Odyssey 5 had already been there and done that.  Premiering on the pay cable network Showtime, O5 put a great premise to the test, and took full advantage of its creative freedom to produce a science fiction series that didn't feel the need to pander to a youthful or family audience.

Nothing against popular shows like Stargate SG-1 or Star Trek, but they're as mainstream and inoffensive as possible, as part of their business model.  Those shows never push any envelopes beyond what they think their audience expects, and as a result those shows often feel like the television equivalent of junk food -- sweet, satisfying, but ultimately not very stimulating or nutritional.  BSG and O5 are the perfect antitheticals to those series; shows with the balls to do away with convention and tell some terrifically dark stories.

Odyssey 5 begins with the world's destruction, and takes us on a 19-episode journey through the lives of five of the most enjoyable, realistic characters I've ever seen in a scifi series.  It was Showtime's highest-or-second-highest-rated program while it was on the air, but it was canceled by those idiots because they wanted to move away from genre television and into the territory of better networks like HBO and FX.  Sadly, it ends on a sour note as the series was canceled despite high ratings, and no wrap ups have been planned so far.

The series was probably the first genre show in ages to treat adult viewers like adult viewers.  The show regularly pushed the envelope in terms of content and subject matter, and as a result, it has never been aired in the US outside of pay networks like Showtime and later HDNet.  In addition to the total creative freedom, the series was free from the traditional TV structure.  Lacking teasers, tags, and act breaks, the episodes play out like a scifi Sopranos, with running times often going longer than the typical 42 minutes allowed for broadcast shows now.  Some episodes run past the 50 minute mark with no commercials, making for some very satisfying storytelling.  It's a shame it got pulled because of some expensive game of Follow The Leader (O5 fans will get the joke).  With a premise and a cast this fantastic, and a fanbase as devoted as this, I'm sure Odyssey 5 will see the light of day again someday.  Perhaps even back at Showtime, where their decision to move away from science fiction precipitated a steep ratings and subscriber decline, and none of their current shows generate any buzz whatsoever.  (Remember, these are the same idiots who CANCELED Stargate SG-1 while it was still their #1 series and put it in the hands of Sci Fi.  What morons.)

I recommend this to anyone wanting a good story with a lot of edge to it.  Tell all your friends.",1147737600,12,2788,4.770833333333333
2522038,3,B000ELL1QC,"AN INTERESTING SHOW. OF COURSE IT WAS ON SHOWTIME WHICH DOESN'T ALWAYS LEARN IT'S LESSON. IF YOU LIKE EVERYONE USING THE F WORD AND LOSING COUNT OF HOW MANY TIMES, THIS IS FOR YOU. AND OF COURSE THE T AND A. COULD HAVE GONE FURTHER.",1146960000,5,232,4.177777777777778
2522039,4,B000ELL1QC,"An intelligent well written series that was cancelled too soon ""Odyssey 5"" only ran one season on Showtime before the network in its infinite wisdom (much as the Sci-Fi Channel did with ""Farscape"") to pull the plug before writer/creator/producer Manny Coto had a chance to resolve the story. Coto went on to revive ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" surprising the best two seasons of that show and providing one of the most compelling story arcs ""Enterprise"" had. He's since gone on to co-producer and writer ""24"". Even without its resolution ""Odyssey 5"" is a worthwhile show to watch. Working on a shoestring budget compared to most shows Coto managed to produce a number of intelligent episodes with some outstanding acting and effects work. Although the DVD set lacks the powerhouse extras we see on some releases it does include a terrific commentary track on the pilot episode with Manny Cotto and Peter Weller providing the play-by-play on the shooting of the show and unshot episodes.

While completing a routine mission to service a satellite the crew of the Space Shuttle Odyssey 5 Commander Chuck Taggart (Peter Well), biologist Kurt Mendel (Sebastian Roch?), Neil Taggart (Christopher Gorham), astronaut Angela Perry (Tamara Craig Thomas) and TV newscaster Sara Forbes witness the implosion of the Earth. Suddenly the human race with the exception of these five individuals has been wiped out. Running out of oxygen and with no options the crew wait for their end aboard the Space Shuttle. They're saved by an alien who calls himself the Seeker (John Neville ""Baron Munchausen"" and ""The X-Files"") whose own world was also wiped out by a mysterious force referred to as Leviathan. It seems the Seeker has been trying to contact other intelligent species for 300 years but each time he arrives it's the same-the world has been destroyed with all its inhabitants. The Odyssey 5 crew are the first survivors he's run into and he offers them the hope of averting Earth's destruction by sending their consciousness 5 years into the past so they can unravel who and what was behind the Earth's destruction.

While some episodes of the show could be a bit routine (for example the one where the crew begin losing their memory had a lot of potential but fails to deliver)the overall quality of the show was extremely high with intelligent scripts that dealt with difficult ethical and moral issues within a science fiction frame work. For example the series frequently deals with the impact when the crew tries to change tragic or difficult events in their own past and how things don't quite work out the way they had planned. Overall the show had much promise and I'm hoping that Coto returns to the show again either in a TV mini-series format (hopefully with the original cast) or film to resolve the cliffhanging conclusion of the show.

Sony has provided us with ""Odyssey 5"" on five dual layered single sided discs. Although there's some minor digital artifacts overall the show looks splendid. With sharp, bold colors and a strong 5.1 mix. The dialogue is clear and crisp while direction effects are particularly nice during the pilot episode.

While short on special features the show is presented as it aired on Showtime not the version that was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel. Manny Coto and Peter Weller provide an intelligent perceptive commentary track on the two hour pilot episode. It's a pity that Sony chose not to have them do a commentary track on any of the other episodes but I'm grateful that we got some extras with this set. I'm sure that Showtime probably had a behind-the-scenes featurette that they aired prior to the show's premiere but Sony would probably have to license that from Showtime. The price for the 19 episodes is a bit steep (but not out of line with other shows of its type) however given the excellent transfer, 5.1 mix and commentary track it's worth it. Coto doesn't share how the series was going to conclude in the commentary track as he has hopes that he might be able to revive the concept for a made for cable movie (Sci-Fi this is your chance to make up for screwing the pooch when you cancelled ""Farscape"") or a series of movies. I'm hoping that he can pull it all together as this series (and its fans) deserves to have a resolution worthy of its intriguing concept.

A terrific show that certainly deserved better treatment than it received from Showtime (hey if Showtime can keep on some of the trash they've committed to over the years they certainly should have lived up to the commitment to allow Coto to close out the series), ""Odyssey 5"" may frustrate a few fans because it doesn't have a resolution but the show's terrific writing and acting make this a worthwhile show to pick up for science fiction fans. I knew there was a good reason why I cancelled Showtime.

So why not 5 stars? The transfer is exceptional (5 stars) with great 5.1 audio. The show deserves it but without a resolution and only 1 extra (Manny Coto and Peter Weller's commentary track which is exceptional)the set gets four stars. Hopefully Coto can convince the Sci-Fi Channel (which ran the series recently) to spring for a six hour minin-series to tie up the loose ends much like ""Farscape"" (a show that Sci-Fi idiotically cancelled and then returned to for the concluding mini-series).",1145923200,165,5314,4.827661909989023
2522040,5,B000ELL1QC,"I didn't really know what to expect from this series. I bought it for one reason and one reason only - Peter Weller.  I was hooked in the first five minutes. This series will seriously blow your emotional circuitry! It is beyond me why Peter Weller is NOT a superstar, he is phenomenally talented! Stunning special effects, apparently the pilot was made on a budget that resembles a shoe string! The stories compel, confuse, rattle, move and inspire. My heart breaks in ""The choices we make"" the scene where Peter (Chuck) talks about his tumultuous relationship with his father. I am furiously livid that this series was cancelled. I turn on the TV and 90% of it is utter and total tripe. Peter is pushing onto the big 60, so I hope Manny Coto gets it sorted soon and brings this series back cause no-one will be able to fill Professor Weller's shoes!",1145404800,18,851,4.562091503267974
2522041,5,B000ELL1QC,"Odyssey 5 is my favorite sci-fi show of all time.  It is like watching the X-Files, the Matrix, Quantum Leap, and Star Trek all at the same time.  I believe it is one of the first shows to have the same realism that the Matrix had, you really believe that it is possible.

The plot: (you learn the following in the first 30 minutes)

There are astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Odyssey, when they see the Earth explode, or implode to be precise.  There are only 5 survivors aboard the shuttle, when they are picked up by an Alien life form that calls itself ""The Seeker"".  ""The Seeker"" sends them back in time to try and save the Earth from exploding.

Odyssey 5 has an air of realism that I have not seen in a sci-fi show since the Matrix, at least until Neo gets super powers in the real world:(  The plot, writing, screenplay, acting, music, and science are all exceptional.  And because of the drama and storyline, it is a show that you can probably watch with your wife, or significant other, but probably not your kids, due to some brief nudity and obscene language.

I can go on and on, so I guess I should stop now.  I am sure this show will one day be completed, in one form or another, after all ""Anything is possible.  You believe that, don't you?""

2522042,5,B000ELL1QC,"That Showtime kept Jeremiah and cancelled O-5 stuns me to this day, obviously some political move on the backend was the reason for the demise of this instand classic.  No one I know who watched it didn't love it.  Peter Weller was amazing, as was the rest of the cast, and the arcing storyline was brilliant to the end, which, sadly, was not the conclusion.  To add insult to injury, they left us with a huge cliffhanger that will likley never be resolved.  Actors from O-5 have moved on to other projects, so chances are we will never find out if the crew of Odyssey 5 will save the Earth from complete destruction.  The only thing keeping me from buying this DVD set is the lack of a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th season to complement it.  As it stands, it's a brilliant peak into a story that deserved to make it through to the end.  Seeing Manny Coto get bounced to the mediocre-to-awful Star Trek: Enterprise only makes it worse, since O-5 was the kind of show that makes all Trek seem cheap and unoriginal.  At some point, I'm sure I thought seeing them release O-5 on DVD would be a good thing, but now that it's going to happen, it only feels like a hollow slap in the face to those who enjoyed it.",1142985600,10,1200,4.278761061946903
2522043,5,B000ELL1QC,"This was my all time favorite show after Quantum Leap.  It was a mix of the aforementioned show and X-Files.  The drama, the humor, the conspiracies, the top-notch acting (especially Peter Weller in his best role ever), the intelligence all mixed into a wonderful bubble and then blown up for you on your television set.

  I was hooked as soon as the Earth exploded (or did it implode?) in the very first episode, setting up the incredible story of 5 people left over on a shuttle with no home to go to.  The emotional images after the catastrophe, and the way the 5 on the shuttle Odyssey handled it drew me in as a viewer and I was suddenly attached the characters before the show was even a quarter of the way through.

  When the season ended, I was excited for it to continue and then devastated to find out that I would not be able to follow the crew of the Odyssey on any more adventures.  Yes, I was one of those geeks that wrote to everyone I could over at Showtime to get my show back on the air.  But it didn't happen and I cancelled my subscription to Showtime, sadly because the only things I watched on it were Odyssey 5 and Jeremiah (which was an okay show).

  In conclusion....  I'd have to say that this is worth watching if you're a fan of the shows that I mentioned above.  But prepare to be disappointed and left wanting more as soon as you finish watching the final episode.... can you say ""cliffhanger""?",1142899200,10,1427,4.3283018867924525
2522044,5,B000ELL1QC,"Reviews usually aren't my thing, but I couldn't pass this up.  Odyssey 5 was probably the most intelligent sci-fi show to ever be aired on tv.  Extremely well written, the mix of science, paranoia, humor and pathos always gave the viewer something to think about until the next episode.  This is not a series for the strictly ray-guns and rocketship set or for kids. No neat package of happy endings was ever offered throughout the series, and some real human tragedies were handled with seemingly heartfelt emotion. There was plenty of action, and more real science than most fictional tv offers, however, the soul of the show was real people balancing their altered lives with the burden of an impossible situation and an awesome responsibility. I highly recommend this series for any sci-fi buff or anyone who enjoys a really good drama and won't be put off by the science/techie talk.",1141689600,29,888,4.867549668874172
2522045,5,B000ELL1QC,"This series is quite possibly my alltime favourite, Manny Coto is somewhat of a genius.

The five main characters (Chuck Taggart, Neil Taggart, Kurt Mendel, Angela Perry and Sarah Forbes) are played by great actors, and are deep interesting and the series explores each background.

The overall plot has been well thought out and is unpredictable so the audience doesn't get bored. The action doesn't ever stop, and there is a fair amount of humour between the characters too, especially in the episode featuring Ted Raimi.

It is definitely a show designed for a more mature audience, as the slightly excessive swearing and naked women make it unsuitable for children.

Seriously worth getting.

If you can accept the far-fetched premise in the pilot, there's a good chance you will get hooked. Knowing next to nothing about this series at the time of purchase, I figured it would be a perfect show for falling asleep to: a hackneyed, possibly campy outlet for my insatiable appetite for the genre. Not so. I was instead surprised to find that rather than putting me to sleep, it was keeping me up too late.

Odyssey 5 has a confident, self-assertive, and quirky personality, with the ability to make you laugh often despite the fate of Earth hanging in the balance. The show even knows how to laugh at itself, as evidenced by episode 5 when Chuck and Kurt consult a sci-fi author for ideas, reminiscent of the 200th episode of Stargate SG-1,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remember-When-200/dp/B000IBQUN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remember When (200)</a>. Sure, it has flaws, including some hokey plot devices and the usual trappings of 20th century [sci-fi] television; however, shortcomings are outbalanced by good sets & locations, sharp actors, and positive little touches such as picking some of the greatest quotes in history to start each episode.

In addition to the venerable Peter Weller, the very underrated actor Sebastian Roch&eacute; (see Thomas Jerome Newton from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fringe-Season-2/dp/B002JVWRD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fringe: Season 2</a>) is a perfect fit for this series, and it seems that the two actors feed off of each other's dispositions when paired together onscreen. The chemistry between the 5 central characters is surprisingly convincing, and helps to make the very improbable story more palatable. At first I was skeptical that Tamara Craig Thomas had much to offer in portraying Angela Perry, but after a few eps you come to appreciate her no-nonsense personality (is it the actor, the character, or both?)

One thing that may catch you off-guard is the profanity and nudity; fine by me, I just wasn't expecting it. Peter Weller is more in his element when he is cursing, so I'm glad this serial wasn't confined to a ""PG"" rating. Overall, I was happy to find out that Odyssey 5 was a hidden gem, but sad to know that it was confined to only 1 season.",1407801600,,2792,5.804878048780488

2522219,1,B000ELL1QC,"Let me start out by saying it is not a space show!!! (space is only in the first episode +/- and repeated on every intro)

It uses limited sets in the production (must have been a low cost production) Not quite as bad as ""Archie Bunker"" they did some how get some real NASA footage (cool) but not very move like (you got to edit the footage dude!).

The episodes don't flow together, nor are they a good series of events.  Just events, +/- connected.

OK wow what is it:
 It is the odd 5 (They are not the best actors ""in my Opinion"") (their characters could never have made it into NASA ""other than for PR"" let alone on to a shuttle) but hey there they are. You might have to stretch to see this is possible (hell it is SYFI+/-)

step one: while doing dumb stuff on the shuttle the planet blows up below them ( I did like the compact car flying by them! but again not going to happen)
a alien (if you did not figure it out was an AI) sends there consciousness back 5 years so they could prevent the earth from blowing up.

For the folks that thought this was a cliff hanger (""They did not succeed, else how could they have been sent back"") one of those chicken and egg thought issues. But could have been resolved with a dream (But the writers were not there, hell the show was not there)

In any case the rest of the soap opera consists of a ""dinner scene"" (i.e. cheap production) in every episode / some action to stop computer AI entities on the internet from destroying the world. and that is about it. Oh the AI on earth make fake people that are colder than real people they are suppose to be.

Things I grew to hate! I do mean hate! as I sat through most of the episodes (Petter Wellers voice)  not sure what it is, but it becomes like scratching on a  chalk board. (The lack of any real characters or there development)

You can watch any episode in any order and it makes sense +/- so if you start in the middle you are about the same spot as if you start at the end.

There may be some plot but it is not that great (I am guessing they tried to sell a second season to pull it together) did not work for the network guys nor did I see it working for me. (at least with the acting and writing style they were using)

Bottom line; this was gamble on my part with a 3 stars when I bought it, and now it is 4 stars, HOW??  could be, one of those shows that you have to see stoned, but then again if you are, who cares what you are watching.

2522220,2,B000ELL1QC,The show had a good concept to work with but was handicapped from the start by twitchy irrational characters who behaved more like explosive teenagers than professional astronauts and scientists.  And what's the deal with a 22 y/o astronaut?  If you can get beyond that then there are the numerous plots and sub-plots which never seem to lead anywhere.  Some were good ideas that had potential but even these never related back to the original info given to them by the alien being they meet in the show opener; with over 50 worlds already destroyed  are we to believe that rogue sentient computer programs and synthetic beings created by them just popped up randomly by themselves.  We never even get a glimpse of an alien race behind the conspiracy nor do we get any other possible explanation.  I could go on but the fact that it was cancelled after a single season says it all.

Second, the blue scenes with the scientist were pointless, badly done, and obviously tossed in for ratings. Overall, buy it, watch, and enjoy.",1301097600,,494,4.963855421686747
2522246,4,B000ELL1QC,"Definitely not for kids!  Language, sex, nudity, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse - all from our heros - mark this as a series aimed at late-night SciFy channel viewers.

That being said, I generally loved the show and was dismayed at its abrupt ending on one of the better episodes (directed by Peter Weller, by the way) that was on the cusp of pulling together the overall story arch. You might skip disc 4 entirely and pick up the episodes on disc 5.  Like Firefly, this definitely ended just as it was beginning to find solid footing - so be forewarned!  I find myself seriously wishing that someone could take Coto's notes and write the intended ending to the series!  Rarely have I cared so much about the resolution of a show terminated before its time.

The show has many solid, good points, most notably the overarching story line that foreknowledge would not be an unalloyed benefit.  All the characters struggle with trying to change or avoid bad events -- or to hasten good ones -- generally with poor to mixed results.  It was heartbreaking at times to watch the protagonists try to prevent events only to fail via different routes in the new timeline.  Although there were certainly successes to pique their hope and ours.

The main characters were interesting and intriguing, with strengths and weaknesses that affected how well (or poorly) they coped with their strange predicament.  It was refreshing to have heros who were not saints - and who sometimes tried to avoid the burden placed upon them, but then return through their reluctantly developing friendships.  Characters grew during the short season, and it would have been fascinating to watch how they managed to get themselves all back in space on the same mission given how they changed history by going back in time.

The chemistry between all the major characters was phenomenal, and solid acting made up for weaknesses in the plot of several episodes.  Of course, I could listen to either Weller or Roche reading just about anything, but the dialog, especially between the main characters, ranged between dryly ironic and wildly hilarious.  It is worth watching just to pick up the throw-away one-liners.

This was a show that tried, perhaps too hard, to become a cult classic among sci-fi fans.  References to Buckaroo Bonzai, Star Wars, and frequently Star Trek would appeal to die-hard nerds, but probably fell upon deaf ears among any straights in the crowd.  Of course, watching Roche (Kurt Mendel) fighting against AI constructs knowing that he'd BE one in Fringe (as Thomas Jerome Newton) just adds to the fun when watching this nearly a decade after production.

In the end, the most frustrating thing about the show is the literacy device by which the writers kept the viewers as much in the dark and frustrated about what was really going on as our heros themselves were.  Several episodes just start with something strange that does not seem to tie into what happened previously, or what we know about our protagonists - resulting in the ""freak of the week"" syndrome.  By the end of the 5th disc, you're starting to see where they were leading us, but by then, it is too late.

It is definitely worth watching, if only to see what may have been some initial roots for shows like LOST.  Given the time it was produced, Odyssey 5 was breaking a lot of new ground and doing the social commentary that sci-fi often brings us - and which often signals its own ending.",1297555200,2,3450,4.761344537815126
2522247,4,B000ELL1QC,"This series needed to go longer so it could have been resolved, at least.  I found the last episode disturbing, but great as a cliff-hanger for a next season that never materialized.  Still a good choice for my collection. GOOD!!!",1294358400,,230,4.725
2522248,5,B000ELL1QC,"A well produced TV show that draws you in and is very enjoyable to watch.

2522249,3,B000ELL1QC,"The premise of Odyssey 5 is interesting, involving 5 people who survive the end of the world and have their consciousnesses sent back in time 5 years, in order to change history (notice a whole lot of 5's running around this review.  It must be an alien plot).  You can read all the great promo material for this series here at amazon, so I won't waste time rewriting a synopsis, but get right to my views.

This series had a lot of potential, and if it had run for more than one season it may have been truly great, but it was sadly cut short, leaving us with an unresolved cliffhanger and a whole lot of ideas.  With that said, there are a couple of stylistic flaws which aided the decline of this series before its time.  1:  The language was excessive.  Every other word was a curse word at times, and it got to the point where it distracted from the show.  2:  The brief scenes of full female nudity weren't really necessary, and they were often stuffed into episodes just because they could put them there.

I personally believe that this series would have lasted at least 2 seasons (or possibly even longer) if not for the adult content which lowered the viewing potential.  From an economical standpoint, this series would have had a lot more profitability if it had been done as a PG-13 format, for the syndication value would have increased.  There are a lot of networks that still don't show R-rated content.

In my estimation, if you liked the X-Files and don't mind a lot of swearing and a few minor scenes containing naked women, you'll enjoy Odyssey 5.  The DVD set is petty cheap, too, so I'd recommend it for the aforementioned folks.  However, I would most certainly not recommend it for anyone with strict morals, or for children.",1293235200,2,1749,4.507936507936508

This show could have easily gone on another year...it seems like they were trying for a five year series but that would have been overkill.  It's too bad that they didn't wrap up the loose ends with the final episode or make a movie to do so.

Unlike many other reviewers here I didn't think that the language was really an issue...nor was there very much nudity.  I still wouldn't let children watch it...but it was made for adults not children.

During these 19 episodes you really got to know each of the main five characters.  Even though they had different personalities they all flowed together very nicely.  They had some interesting plot twists...which makes it all the more sad that they couldn't have done another year.

For the price it's worth watching...it's good entertainment but be ready to finish the series in your own head as there is no ending here.",1290556800,,946,4.656626506024097

On the other hand it ended with a somewhat cliff-hanger finale that never saw continuation. You'll get the questions from the pilot answered but be left hanging on so many more questions that develop in the course of the season.

The writing, acting, and plots are superb and easily stands up with the best of any television in the Sci-Fi genre or out of it. This show should be picked up and continued right now if there were more execs with brains in the entertainment industry (which we've seen by cancellations of shows like Star Trek, Firefly, Babylon 5 there aren't).

The warning for some audiences is that this show was made for Showtime and contains plenty of profanity and nudity.

2522266,5,B000ELL1QC,"My flatmate suggested watching his copy of Odyssey 5 since he knew I'm a sci-fi fan. After watching the first 2 discs I was convinced this was a very worthwhile series. There is a central story played throughout the series, as opposed to individual episodes geared toward an audience with short attention span and/or an overly busy lifestyle. The characters were well developed, the dialouge was clever and true to the characters, the actors were convincing... on the whole this was a unique series which blended intellect with entertainment.

THEN the story makes a big leap on the last episode with plot progression and several loose ends which were never dealt with. The series was canceled. After doing reading through blogs and info sites full of pissed off fans like myself, it was apparently canceled by Showtime despite having considerable ratings. From both a business and an artistic standpoint, this was the blunder of all blunders.

After considering this outrage, Odyssey 5 is still worth buying and watching for sci-fi fans out there. It is to be appreciated by it's own accord and should not be considered ""better"" or ""worse"" than other series like Star Trek.

This was also a cutting edge sci-fi drama that captured the creepiness, and sense of impending dread, of a typical X-Files episode. The casting was pretty much spot-on, especially in the casting of Peter Weller as the weary but seasoned Astronaut and crew commander.

It felt like the plug got pulled on this show, just as it was about to reveal some details as to how the government was implicated in the events that led up to the end of the world.

The best Sci-Fi series with a great human touch,a pity that touch deleted it from our screens as it is far and above all of the Star Wars spin-offs and Star Wars lites out there.
This series was better acted and had storylines and twists that made it an absolute pleasure and mind challenging experience.
It brought forward all of the what ifs?and all of the huge questions that mankind faces without ever being smug or condescending,it never talked down to the viewer with alien languages and having to decipher histories of people we do not know exist etc.
It simply stared at human kind in the face and brought our faces up to and beyond the mirror of all of the strange thoughts and frightening scenarios that we feel are so far away,and brought them to us in this groundbreaking show,stellar cast,each episode was made like a movie and taking this off the air makes me hope that all of the alien networks out there in the universe picked up the option to carry it for many more seasons(haha).",1184198400,2,1011,4.56043956043956

2522278,1,B000ELL1QC,"I have to agree with some other reviewers. I've seen the original series and I still have all of the episodes of the Showtime version recorded. When I saw this on the shelf as ""The Complete Series"", I naturally assumed that the discussion of a direct-to-DVD conclusion had finally gotten some results. Instead, it turns out that this should be called ""The Incomplete Series"". Of course, you have no way of knowing this if you buy it in a store.

There's no indication on the outer packaging of what episodes are included. No indication that it ends prematurely and no mention that the series was cancelled before the conclusion of the storyline.

This show was a single continuous storyline with numerous highly connected sub-plots. Pretty much all of them are left hanging. Unless you want to join a large community of frustrated fans who are unlikely to ever receive any sort of closure, I'd avoid buying the set. (no, there's absolutely no hint of what the conclusion was going to be in any of the commentary or extras, either :/ ) However, if you catch wind of a real conclusion (made-for-TV, direct-to-disc movie or even a simple paper copy of Manny Coto's story notes), rush out and buy this set and enjoy it first.

Yes, it's an outstanding dramatic Sci-fi series with top-notch writing, acting, direction and production. However, the more that you enjoy it, the more upset you'll be at being left hanging.",1163289600,36,1413,4.782786885245901
2522279,5,B000ELL1QC,"Pardon me for being late to the reviews.

In picking up this series at the Library, I was compelled when I saw at least six episodes of 'O5' past the pre-emptive shutdown that Showtime imposed on this well-done and ill-fated series. The last episode I recall them showing was 'Skin' and the death of Taggart's wife, Paige. Now I get the treat of seeing what happened past that only to be left with a cliff-hanger unresolved. I not only refreshed myself with the episodes I've seen, I've also seen what Showtime should have aired but -in their own self-interest- allowed to not ever be seen on their network.

That, in itself, says volumes about how Showtime likes to work and I'm certainly NOT impressed by it.

'Odyssey 5', in my mind, is only rivaled by the present 'Battlestar Galactica' for coherent plots, excellent acting and great twists of the storyline. This series engages the brain. You don't simply sit on the couch, you want to join in with the characters. I so wish that Showtime would've gotten their heads out of their nether regions to allow the series to have ran its full course.

However, they didn't. Thus we are left with what is and dreams of what might have been.

Yes, this series- short as it is- is worth the money to buy it in my book.",1161648000,8,1263,4.521929824561403
2522280,5,B000ELL1QC,"This is absolutley one of the best series I have ever seen in my 40 years of watching television! It's obvious why the executives at Showtime paniced: The show was way too subversive for a politically conservative medium like cable t.v.! The political and philosphical statements Odyssey 5 were literally making in each episode were just too much for the spineless creatures that rule the cable airwaves!

My favorite genre is science fiction & fantasy. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly over the years. Nothing, except for Star Trek, Farscape and Babylon 5 comes close to the genius and passion of Odyssey 5! I can think of few television series where I cared so much for each main character, or the extensive range of emotions felt. The series was like theater! There's no other way to describe it!

Had those responsible at Showtime kept Corporate at bay, instead of canceling the series literally in mid-sentence, the eventual controversey Odyssey 5 might have generated would've been good for business!

The only drawback the series had was the importance of watching each episode in sequence. But with all the recording technology now available, this minor obstacle would not have been very difficult to overcome!

The loss to science fiction was incalcuable by the obnoxious cancelation of this unique series. Perhaps, someone soon will have the courage to pick up the pieces and write a book, or make a movie, and finish the series with the same amount of passion and subversiveness as the creators of Odyssey 5 did! One can only hope!",1156032000,62,1553,4.871212121212121
2522281,5,B000ELL1QC,"Here goes another well told series cut out before its prime. Odyssey 5 was a Shotime series (you know the network that gave you a show like Fat Actress and Stargate SG1, this show was inbetween). Showtime cut the Odyseey show short by give the run of 19 episodes.

For its maiden and only season, Odyseey combined a time travel premous with an end of the world ideal(these five people from the shuttle Odyssey were put back on earth five before it imploded to find out why it was and try to stop it). It works well as a good SF series, it does not dwell as million of Special efects like a Star Trek or Battlestar would, it dwells within  the human emotions that movies this series...I think this is one of the reasons that this series fail to find an audience. It  also foreshadowed items that would or coulkd be used in the show's season season which never came to pass..too bad

The casting of Peter Weller as the mission Odyssey commander was  brillant. He isn't a epic hero in the sense like Robocop (which he played in two movies), he is a frailer down to earth man. With this role, you don't need an epic hero type like James T. Kirk. Note this show is a polar opposite from Star Trek in its scope

There is an audio commentary track of the pilot episode with Producer Manny Moto and Peter Weller which gives an insite to what may have happened in future seasons if the show was to continue

DAMN Showtime and the Sci-FI channel! for Showtime, This was an educated smart series that should have been given a chance to grow, so do another FAT ACTRESS please.  For Sci-Fi Channel, Odyssey would have worked in your Schedule with Stargate SG1 which is the OLDEST RUNNING SCIENCE FICTION  series on TV (and note was started on SHOWTIME Network)and the Emmy nominated and critic loved  BattleStar Gallatica remake

If you want a smart series, get this DVD set. It is worth watching to see what you should have seen

2522284,3,B000ELL1QC,"I'd recorded the entire series off of Showtime and kept it on my TiVos in case I had to make my own DVD set, while in any case being more than happy to buy the commerical release.  I've seen too many good shows disappear and get locked behind contractual obligations preventing their DVD release (Fox's Doctor Who with Paul McGann available on DVD in UK in PAL but not in the US in NTSC) or the requirements of music licensing altering important scenes (Quantum Leap's ""M.I.A."" and the significance of Ray Charles' ""Georgia On My Mind"" to the final scene's characters) to not want to preserve television as aired for future generations.

Due to this extreme timeshifting for personal use within the privacy of my home (and an expectation of copyright being non-perpetual), I have the ability to compare what they aired with what was released on DVD.

The most notable omission is the loss of the initial ""SHOWTIME presents"" and the recap at the start of each episode (except the pilot episode obviously).  This is most noticeable on the third episode where there survives an audio artifact at the end of the recap that overlapped the start of the opening credit sequence.

There seems to be a trend these days to cut out part of TV series when put to DVD, the worst offender I've encountered being the War of the Worlds first season cutting the alien hand coming over and gripping the Earth.  Some set reviews suggest entire episodes are being omitted for being ""weak"" (The Tick animated series).  I fear for what might be done to Max Headroom's end-of-episode rants and commercial-break awareness.  Commercial bumpers tend to only survive on cartoon fare (The Transformers, Robotech).  The ability to have seamless branching video on DVDs should be employed to give everyone what they want.

Strange choices were made for alternate languages and subtitles for a Region 1 release:  Japanese and Portuguese instead of the usual French and Spanish, and no English subtitles.  And here I was ready to go to the effort of converting the closed captions into subtitles, and record the whole series again to get the SAP for the secondary audio track.  If it includes closed captions (line21 data) in English, I haven't seen them: my CC-capable TV only supports them on RF, composite, and S-Video inputs, not component video where I prefer to watch my DVDs.

I did encounter something interesting about the 5.1 sound mix entirely by accident:  all the dialog appears to be on the center channel.  I discovered this when I found I had reversed the connections between the Center and Subwoofer on my DVD player's multichannel output vs. the stereo receiver.  If you want to hear it without dialogue, you can just disconnect your Center speaker.

Another change is the distributor card at the end of the episodes.  Early episodes which were Columbia-Tristar are now Sony Pictures (as later reruns were as well), and they put in a more elaborate card with more musical flourishes than they used on Showtime (one or two have the shorter Sony card).  Sony still owns Columbia-TriStar, so they still could have used the old card and either added the new Sony card after it or let the DVD-encompassing super-fancy one stand for their overall branding.  (Compare the shows still running on television with vintage Desilu cards long after being absorbed by Paramount.)

Special features really just consist of a commentary track for the first episode, but the information in it about where the series was headed is a must-listen.  A bit of a laugh though as they say at the end Manny Coto reiterates that he'll never tell how it was going to end in case he gets the chance to finish it, but he'd already revealed it all!  Cancelled TV series should be free to have the remaining scripts, story ideas, and arcs developed into an official series of paperback books if a reversal or TV movies can't be released timely enough (they'd have to recast Corey or write him out off-screen now).

The episodes are not individual tracks but rather they are stored back-to-back at chapter marks on one long track.  Perhaps this an anti-piracy tactic to frustrate rippers wanting to share individual episodes, but it doesn't seem worth it.

There are no trailers for upcoming episodes or other promotional content about the series.  Thankfully I still have what I have on my TiVo so I can construct my own extras disk.  Unfortunately I don't have a complete set of trailers nor the excellent spots that were run before the series premiered, so even by doing it for myself my set will still be incomplete.  But I'd certainly buy it if they were to make an official extras disk available.

In summary: I can forgive them for excluding the trailers, and the multi-episode tracks I can live with (until the remixing DVD players come out), but the excising of the episode recaps and the language and subtitle choices in a Region 1 release have regrettably cost this release 1+2/3 stars, which rounds to two.  If recaps were good enough for premium cable, they're good enough for a DVD.  Not everyone is willing to watch a whole TV series in one sitting, even one as excellent as Odyssey 5, and some appreciate the highlighting of the specific previous events being expanded upon in this next episode.

The series is excellent and still a must-have, but the DVD execution is strangely flawed.  If this were a review specifically about the series, it would be a perfect 5, which is why it started at 5.  Only the execution of the features is what brings it down.",1150156800,18,5524,4.777894736842105

At the heart of Odyssey 5 is a talented cast with great chemistry:

Peter Weller is perfectly cast as Commander Chuck Taggart, a kind of Buzz Aldrin/Chuck Yeager hybrid. A great leader for the team and their mission.

Tamara Marie Watson brings an intellectual charm and ""girl next door"" sexuality to the role of astronaught Angela Perry. A great actress who's character should have been utilized much more.

Sebastian Roch very effectively portrays Kurt Mendel, a behavioral geneticist and something of a playboy. Great chemistry and character interplay between Weller and Roch.

Leslie Silvadelivers a solid performance as reporter Sarah Forbes. Although her character faces many personal struggles as a result of the main plot device, I think the writers could have done much more with her character.

Christopher Gorham as Neil Taggart, Chuck Taggart's 22 year old son. Gorham plays well with Weller and adds much to the series.

The pilot episode is outstanding. I'd rank it on par with the best of Star Trek. Not every episode is a winner, but most are filled with terrific acting, well written dialogue, and interesting plot twists.

As some other reviewers have noted, there's some harsh language and also some nudity, which I didn't find inappropriate. I've never understood how some people are offended by nudity while almost never complaining about violence.  Thankfully this series has very little violent content of a graphic nature.

Series creator Manny Coto has said on many occasions that he'd like to revisit the series, giving it another season or at least a series finale. Fans are still holding out hope!

Some of the subsequent episodes of Odyssey 5 have some similarities with some of The Outer Limits and The Twilight Zone episodes.

Most sci-fi shows don't contain any nudity.
