8438414,1,B004QOAKCO,"The only positive review on this product or the other Bigfoot Documentaries produced by Mitchell Waite, are by Mitchell Waite himself. He talks about mean spirited reviews, but in his ""mean spiritedness"" he treats the public like they are a bunch of complete morons that will believe everything he tells them, even though there is no real proof or even room for the possiblity of Bigfoot. The poor production and joke he makes of this, makes you want to believe all Bigfoot evidence is a hoax and no possiblity at all of a of a Bigfoot. He also invents a story for an area that is not know for Bigfoot sightings. I grew up in the Mogollon and White Mountain area of AZ. And it seems like Waite is not even from there, but a tourist out of the bigger cities like the 2 idiots out of Tucson that started the wildfires a few yrs back. MOre a a danger and menace to nature and society than he is a help. NOt a legitimate researcher, but a hoaxer and con artist. His items should get zero stars if Amazon would allow it.",1378771200,,1015,4.291666666666667
8438415,1,B004QOAKCO,"There is no evidence presented here.  A blurry picture analyzed looks like a chimp.  Sasquatch does not look like a chimp.  They find a supposed huge nest, go in it see some activity and then leave saying lets leave whatever is in there alone!?!?!  Are they serious?  Everything about this dvd is crap and false.  Please don't waste your time and find other documentaries which have credibility.",1316044800,3,395,4.82089552238806
8438416,5,B004QOAKCO,"It is very evident that one reviewer has never been in the woods or hasn't the slightest clue as to how difficult field research can be.  Perhaps, the reviewer has spent too much time in front of the TV where everything is picture perfect.  These are real people in the field capturing their discoveries with the equipment they have available.  Some footage was taken by Stealth Game Cameras which have no sound, and at night, some cameras do not video due to darkness, but only sound is available.  The reviewer has no concept of what happens when an animal is cornered.  Press the issue, and either it or you will have to die.  Either case is unacceptable.  So, remember there are those arm chair critics that have never produced anything on their own expecpt mean spirited hateful garbage they call a review.",1303689600,6,811,4.669014084507042
8438417,1,B004QOAKCO,"Poor excuse for a Bigfoot Documentary. Yep, A Fool and his Money are soon parted, I'm the Fool !!!You have grainy out of focus Video with no sound and sound with no Video. A Human Hand is being passed off as a Bigfoot Hand. A tape of a Bigfoot Howl is being played on equipment in a shed and and someone in a sleeping bag is pretending Bigfoot is outside. Dumb scene of a whole group of Investigators finding a purported Bigfoot Nest and someone climbing inside and seeing something dark inside(a supposed Bigfoot Baby)with his Nightvision Mode on his Camera but not sticking around afraid of the Bigfoot Mother maybe nearby. Plus a Photo shopped Picture of Bigfoot while a audio of two alleged Bigfoot are making sounds and then comes The End. The Running length states 54 Minutes but it seemed like 15 minutes to me.",1301097600,4,818,4.533783783783784
