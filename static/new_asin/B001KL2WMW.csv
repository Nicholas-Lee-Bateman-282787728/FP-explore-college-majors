8315260,3,B001KL2WMW,"I like the actor Jamie Draven and wanted to see the movie because he was in it.  I should have know just from the picture, but would have watched it regardless",1389571200,2,159,4.129032258064516
8315261,4,B001KL2WMW,"I liked the movie, the actors, especially Jamie Draven.  I have seen him in quite a few things I think this is one of his best performances and was an awesome story line about PTSD in our Military.  Jamie deplicted his character 100% and  is a very young and inspiring actor. You could see the look in his eyes as if he had truly lived the experience.  Yes, it was sad to watch him kill his wife and 2 children...but these things do go on.  I would recommend watching the movie it was almost 3 hours long, but it kept your attention with his daughter trying to make him love her and her strong belief that her mom and brothers would come back and every thing would be better.  It was a tear jerker for me especially the ending. Yes I would recommend this movie",1372723200,,760,4.206896551724138
8315262,3,B001KL2WMW,"I think the title of the last review was helpful - oddly affecting.  The violence is a noticeable feature but having watched it, it was a worthwhile movie.  It was memorable and scenes replay in my head (not so much the death scenes).  Can't say I noticed the length.

As for the accent on our protagonist, well, yeah, it was kind of strange.  Evidently it's hard to wipe out his mancunian origins but he was chosen for a reason, despite that - a stellar performance.  He can pretty much out-brood anyone and, accent aside, makes a very believable character.  Can't imagine anyone doing it better.

The little girl - perfect casting again.  In fact, I thought they were all very well cast.  And why wouldn't there be a good-looking cafe owner in the mix?  surely not everyone flees the small town.

The scenery is bleak but spectacular and very evocative of the desolation that characterises the movie.  As a movie - well acted, well cast, scenic and it stays with you in a haunting lyrical way.  No happy endings though - you have been warned!",1279152000,4,1044,4.572972972972973
8315263,3,B001KL2WMW,"This is almost 3 hours long, which is too long. But, still, I managed to watch it all in one sitting, which says something about the drama, I guess. Yes, the lead actor's accent is all over the map: I guess he's a Brit, but he sounds southern US at times, then northern. At least he has a great hairline. The little girl's performance is great. The hottie restaurant owner is unrealistic, as if she would be stuck in a one horse town like the one here somewhere in Wyoming. The issue is post traumatic stress syndrome among Iraq vets. But the vet here would have been tracked down a lot sooner in real life than depicted here, being lackadaisically trailed after murdering his nagging wife and two sons.",1264636800,4,703,4.457364341085271
8315264,3,B001KL2WMW,"I had to set aside some serious time to review this whole release as there are over 7 hours of film and material to get through. This film has been both touted and lambasted for representing a facet of PTSD amongst returning Iraq/Afg vets, and I will admit it covers it in length (the film is 3 hours long). After watching this and the associated docus, this should best be kept as a film review, since anything else begs for arguments.

Some spoilers: The story revolves around an Iraq vet who lives in squalor while supporting his family of five in a junkyard trailer. The amount of depression and misery is detailed in minute eloquence, sometimes for 10-15 minutes at a time with no dialogue. He eventually snaps, commits a brief serial killing and flees. The scenery of Canada was well preserved, and the scope of panoramic vistas makes for a character in itself. In essence this is a minimalist film with acute bouts of violence. The violence is abbreviated but involves the execution of 2 children.

The performances are varied, with Grace Fulton giving a truly incredible showing as the surviving child accompanying her father on this journey through hell. Jamie Draven (the dad) was a poor choice, as his Brit accent blatantly seeps through in every other scene. He gave convincing looks of evil, with the camera sometimes focused on his stare for minutes at a time. ""Gut wrenching"", ""poignant"", and ""shocking"" fill the reviews across the Internet, but in the end I felt like I had watched an extreme updated version of Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge, complete with a sometimes horribly misplaced music score and tedious subplots.

The special features are extensive, complete with interviews, music info, commentaries and even a deleted scene. I wish I could find a way to say ""yes, absolutely see this long and arduous journey of a film"", but I find that it misses the mark in too many ways. The ending is irritating, but does leave it for you to interpret what it could possibly mean. If you liked the theatrical cut, this 2-disc version is a must own, otherwise dedicate a long evening to a rental.",1235088000,7,2110,4.743869209809264
