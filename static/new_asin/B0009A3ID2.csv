8058716,3,B0009A3ID2,I thought it was great when I was a kid. Now it is okay. I just feel like it was confusing Zip and Lady Frenzy. It just seemed odd. And the whole girl friend thing ended. I just think it did not have staying power. I liked watching the Mario Brothers cartoons too but that is just me.,1438992000,,284,3.913793103448276
