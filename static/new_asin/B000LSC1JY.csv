8163993,1,B000LSC1JY,"I do not know both of the main actors and after seeing other films with other actors, I decided to purchase this movie. I could not even bother to finish the movie as the story was awful as well as the acting was so horrible. I must say this is a waste of money and not worth purchasing this movie. You will be sorry if you chose to watch this.",1279411200,,344,3.9285714285714284
8163994,1,B000LSC1JY,"I absolutely love Regine Valasquez, but this movie is a real drag. She doesn't need the money, so I can't imagine she needed to make this film. I wish she was more selective. The video transfer is very poor - grainy, choppy, and a very low grade DVD. The cover art states ""English subtitles"", but there are none. Very disappointing.",1233446400,,332,4.55
