8575627,4,B00BYLAH8E,"This is a very good black and white German documentary.  This documentary of the Norwegian Campaign of 1940 is told by the German point of view.  There is a lot of footage in this documentary I've never seen before.  When I first purchased this DVD, I though the DVD was in German and subtitled in English.  To my surprise you have the option of listening to the DVD in either in German or English.  The DVD also showed several maps of where the battles took place.  The reason why I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is that the footage is old and places on the documentary is a little dark.  If you are a WWII history buff, and want to know how Germany (who was outnumbered by the Norwegians, English and French forces) won the Norwegian Campaign, this DVD would be great for you collection.",1454025600,2,794,4.324324324324325
