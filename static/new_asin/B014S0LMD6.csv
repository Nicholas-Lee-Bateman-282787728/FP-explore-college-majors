8731712,4,B014S0LMD6,"Fascinating account of the recent reconstruction of Rijksmuseum.  Especially interesting is the way the museum designers interacted with the bicycle-riding public. (There is a passage for bicycles through the ground floor of the museum.)  Have seen this twice--once before, and once after seeing the museum--definitely enhanced the experience.  Highly recommended.",1499731200,,364,6.24
8731713,5,B014S0LMD6,"In preparation for a vacation which will include a few days in Amsterdam (my first visit in 40 years!) I found this terrific 2015 documentary on the transformation of the old art museum to the magnificent new palace of art  which I will see in person in less than two weeks.

This is NOT a tour of the museum. In fact, it ends by showing the public arriving on opening day, but this is over the final (lengthy) credits. What is, however, is a document of why it took 10 years (!) for the museum to reopen  with new galleries  after Queen Beatrix announced funding in 2003 for the complete renovation. We see the art being put into storage, the demolition of parts of the interior and then the meetings with design architects. None of this went easy. And there was a public outcry when a tunnel frequently used by Amsterdams MANY bicyclists was marked for closure.  And there are some staff changes too. Director Oeke Hoogendiojk and his camera crew are literally flies on the wall over the full 10 year period and capture nearly everything.

The film is long at 131 minutes, but I found that watching it in two sittings  one for the first 60 minutes and then the rest  easier to handle. The English subtitles are easy to read, though you msay need the pause button occasionally. The images are wonderful.

No, you will not learn anything about the art on display or the artists. But you will learn about conservation, restoration and  most of all  dealing with bureaucratic issues such as the color of the walls in a room.

There are no special features on the DVD  another fine release from First Run features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8731715,1,B014S0LMD6,"This is the most boring documentary  I have ever watched.  I can't believe I finished it hoping for some redeeming scenes.  There were none.  I learned about The Bicyclist Union in Amsterdam and the bickering between them and the pedestrians.  The film wasn't really about the Rijksmuseum but about the petty squabbles that were the basis for much of the film.  In the end the only painting that you saw rehung in the museum was the Night Watch.  Nothing else.  I have been to the Rijksmuseum and thought The New Rijksmuseum would show where the paintings were hung, more about the different galleries and just a sense of how the newness has transformed the museum.  No way. Don't waste your money unless you want be involved in the interaction  between each person in charge of his own little domain. ""There is no way the bicyclists are going to use my museum"" (during a period of no construction).  This said while the man was hammering nails into boards to block the bicycle lanes.  That might have been fairly amusing if you hadn't suffered through what went before.",1464307200,3,1070,4.693548387096774

8731717,5,B014S0LMD6,"This is an outstanding examination of the boundary between the arts and civic concern. The film follows the entire process from closing to final reopening 10 years later. Along the way, thanks to unusual access to the project, we meet the design team, the local government oversight committee, the locals who keep a wary eye on developments, and the curatorial staff who must decide what to show and what not. It shows us painstaking restorers, as well as close up views of paintings, statuary, and fabrics. Recommended.",1453507200,3,520,4.988505747126437
