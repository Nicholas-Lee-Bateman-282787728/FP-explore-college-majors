8753106,1,B01CIRRO6U,"Review is for the format. Thumbs down for ""manufactured on demand"" burned DVD-R's which are less durable, less compatible and less reliable than DVDs. Press up some DVDs!",1477872000,6,170,5.107142857142857
8753107,1,B01CIRRO6U,"This seller is a crook.  There are four giveaways this dvd is a fake.  1. It came with no security sticker on the outside.  2. The video quality isn't great and it freezes occasionally.  3. The backside of the dvd isn't silver, it's dark purplish grey.  Real dvds are always silver, burned copies are a different color.  4. The clear center ring on the dvd has numbers on it, which proves it was a blank store bought dvd which was then burned.",1475712000,6,443,4.341463414634147
