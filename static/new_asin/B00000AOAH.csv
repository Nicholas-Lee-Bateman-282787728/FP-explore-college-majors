1199032,4,B00000AOAH,"This story is a fine example of Dr. Who at its Gothic best; a small cast, as suffocatingly-claustrophobic setting as one could imagine, and Tom Baker at his best, just weeks before both he and the series topple into wide-eyed  parody in later more self-indulgent adventures.  Paddy Russell directs with  a surprising flair for the material and Terrance Dicks delivers a sharp,  character-driven script.  The monster of the piece, the amorphous Rutan,  has been much criticised but is actually quite a disturbingly-alien  adversary; the episode ending of part 3 - the creature's blood-curdling cry  sounding in the night - is one of the last spine-tingling Dr. Who moments  the show was able to deliver.  All in all, a superb story, showing why  Dr. Who was always at its best without struggling to come to terms with  spaceships and rayguns.",937008000,4,841,4.971223021582734

1199034,4,B00000AOAH,"THE HORROR OF FANG ROCK is one of the most under-rated episodes of the DOCTOR WHO series and may be considered one of the most violent stories from the Tom Baker era, but remains, in my opinion, a classic thriller  straight out of Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE as Tom Baker's  ""The Doctor"" and Louise Jamison's ""Leela"" arrive at a  lonely lighthouse off the coast of England in the early 1900's and get  caught up in a chilling hunt for a mysterious killer where there may be no  escape for anyone! The emphasis in this four-part story is on the  characters, the claustrophic setting inside the lighthouse and the taut  pacing of the story, and perhaps this story should not have been used to  start off the 15th season of DOCTOR WHO, but is one of the best of the  ""history""-setting stories.",919641600,3,805,4.534722222222222

1199047,4,B00000AOAH,"I hadn't seen this episode in years, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  When I first watched it back in the 70s, I remember being unimpressed, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that this was better than I expected.  It's a bit uneven, probably because it was originally written with the character of Sarah Jane Smith in the role of companion; when Elisabeth Sladen left the cast, the story was hastily rewritten to feature the savage Leila and some of the story falls flat as a result.  The Rutans are something of a disappointment, I must admit, which is probably why they never reappeared in the series.

1199051,5,B00000AOAH,"The loose background to this teleplay was based on a poem, and the prose refers to the true mysterious events surrounding the disappearance of three lighthouse keepers from a lighthouse around 1900. The feel of the show in terms of set and atmosphere gives a rather claustrophobic nature to all four of the episodes, which I believe enhances the whole narrative and made the production rather nervy and scary for the target audience of the day.

For the narrative, in essence you have a group of people in relatively inaccessible location - the lighthouse, and rather like an Agatha Christie novel each protagonist is killed off one by one, by a mysterious killer. What follows is Doctors ability to solve this rather deadly puzzle. This was an interesting tale that by and large keeps the audience well entertained.
Once again Tom Baker is top of his game, and for companion Leela played by Louise Jameson and the other actors all do an excellent work here. One of my all-time favorite episodes hence my 5 star rating.",1391040000,,1019,4.7897727272727275

There is a pretty unique ""baddie"" in this story, that is the only on-screen portrayal of its species that I am aware of. A very moody and worthwhile story.",1342569600,,366,4.5606060606060606
1199060,5,B00000AOAH,"For many fans of ""classic"" Doctor Who (the series' initial run from 1963 to 1989), every story is a ""classic."" ""Horror of Fang Rock"" truly lives up to the term--a near-perfect blend of masterful plotting, strong performances and a meticulous evocation of time and place to create a genuinely frightening tale of alien invasion. And yet ""Fang Rock"" had to overcome so many production obstacles and little twists of fate it's a miracle the story was ever produced at all, let alone that it has endured as a series classic.

First off, it was almost never written. When former Doctor Who script editor Terrance Dicks was invited to write a serial for the show's 15th season, he was initially commissioned to write a vampire story, another in the long line of tributes to gothic horror that Dicks had penned over the years. Story development had reached a fairly advanced stage, in fact, when word came down that the BBC planned to adapt ""Dracula"" into a high-gloss miniseries starring Louis Jourdan, and the network forbade Doctor Who to feature a vampire story that season.  So Dicks had to crank out a substitute script in short order.

Tom Baker hated the new script, and director Paddy Russell agreed with him that it wasn't as strong as the vampire story she had seen before plans changed (that script would eventually be produced as ""State of Decay"" in 1980). Baker took out his frustrations on the cast and crew, missing cues on purpose,  quarrelling with Louise Jameson and raging that the dialogue he was being asked to say was ""rubbish."" (Part of the problem was, he resented Jameson's casting for the series in the first place because, after the departure of Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, he had wanted to try playing the Doctor without a companion.) Baker nevertheless turns in a menacing, if dialed-down, performance, especially as he informs Leela that he's made a mistake and locked the monster inside the lighthouse instead of locking it out.

Meanwhile, the show's producers were preparing to introduce a new, regular character to the series, the robotic dog K9. Dicks wisely declined to include K9 in his Edwardian-era horror story set in a lighthouse (the mind reels at the prospect), which meant that ""Fang Rock"" had to be broadcast before the first K9 story, ""The Invisible Enemy,"" which was actually produced first. If Dicks hadn't, ""Horror of Fang Rock"" as we know it would never have happened.

On the production side, Russell was vexed with the many technical challenges posed by the story. The script, she felt, placed too many scenes in the lighthouse's lantern room, whose towering glass panels might pick up unwanted reflections of the cameras and crew. The other lighthouse rooms were too small for the actors to move around in easily, and their circular walls made it difficult to position cameras for the needed shots. Further complicating matters, production was moved to Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, which Russell worried lacked the technical expertise to handle the visual effects required. Finally, she was never satisfied with the design of the alien, which was basically an illuminated glob of green gelatin. Scenes shot as seen through the alien's single eye were effective, but the story would have doubtlessly been improved if the Rutan, a refugee of his race's protracted interstellar war with the Sontarans, had remained an unseen menace that appeared only in the form of humans it killed (kind of like the shape-shifting alien in ""The Thing""). As it is, Rutan's true appearance is revealed too early and too often as a somewhat underwhelming giant jellyfish flopping around on dry land.

Despite this technical flaw, ""Horror of Fang Rock"" remains a masterpiece of sci-fi horror and suspense.  The DVD does not come with the customary making-of documentary but two other Special Features that shouldn't be missed: a 36-minute retrospective on the career of Terrance Dicks in which he's interviewed sharing a pint with producer Barry Letts (Letts died of cancer in 2009), and a retrospective interview with the redoubtable Paddy Russell, who also directed such Doctor Who favorites as ""Pyramids of Mars"" as well as the landmark SF series The Omega Factor.",1336348800,4,4208,4.992867332382311

1199063,4,B00000AOAH,"This is a nice claustrophobic story that takes place entirely in and around a early 20th century lighthouse.  It combines a horror movie sensiblity with a sci-fi alien angle. A worthy addition to anyone's Doctor Who library and very much of a piece with the excellent previous 3 seasons.

This is the first Graham Williams produced story which followed the Philip Hinchcliffe years (arguably the 'golden age' of classic Doctor Who). This story still fits in with the Hinchcliffe Gothic ethos, as does the third story 'Image of the Fendahl'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Image-of-the-Fendahl-Story-94/dp/B001QCWQ5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Image of the Fendahl (Story 94)</a>.  Robert Holmes continued as script editor for the first four stories so 3/4 of them still maintained the Hinchcliffe flavor (not including the lame 'Invisible Enemy'.)

It must have provided hope for fans that the same quality would continue. Unfortunately only the two stories mentioned plus The Sun Makers&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Sun-Makers-Story-95/dp/B001QCWQ62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Sun Makers (Story 95)</a>&nbsp;rose to the previous high level.

1199064,5,B00000AOAH,"Horror of Fang Rock takes place right in the middle of Tom Baker's reign as 'The Doctor'. Both he and Louise Jameson are at their best, with plenty of great lines and scenes from both of them. The overall feel of the episode is the very familiar gothic, Agitha Christie style that is so popular of the show during Tom Baker's years. The only real let down is the Ruton, which comes across horribly, but for those like me who have a fierce imagination, the idea of a huge jellyfish that is not confined to water and can electrocute people is really creepy. The audio commentary is interesting with Terrance Dicks countinually cutting Tom Baker apart and Louise Jameson and John Abott(Vince) defending him. Overall the story is kind of a carry-over from Phillip Hinchcliffe's era, and storys of this quality would not be found in future years.",1281225600,,841,4.6891891891891895
1199065,5,B00000AOAH,"This was a very bizarre story taking place only in a lighthouse. But, do not let that dissuade you from adding it to your collection. It's a masterfully done story. Tom Baker is wonderful in it. For me, it was the first time I got to see a Rutan, the enemy's of the Sontarran's. No, there are no Sontarran's in this, but the Rutan really show's it's true colors and value system in this story. Kind of gives you an understanding of why the Sontarran's want to destroy the Rutan's. I highly recommend this one for your collection. There are some truly scary moments, reminiscent of some of the 50's horror movies. Furthermore, this is a story with Leela the savage as the Doctor's companion. I find her innocence and naivety  to be a refreshing change from many of the other companions. Though, I have liked them all.

1199069,5,B00000AOAH,"In a series about a character who can travel to any place in any time, it seems a little ironic that one of the best episodes ever produced takes place in the confinement of a light house.  But when limited to four rooms and a staircase, with a wonky power supply and a cast of frustrated, scared and suspicious supporting characters, the good Doctor shines.  In the midst of panic, plotting and death, the Doctor's own penchant for chaos seems the only really sane act in the place.  One by one the mysterious horror picks off the supporting cast, and the Doctor and Leela race to solve the mystery.  By the time we come face to face (so to speak) with with the perpetrator, it really doesn't matter that it looks like something the Doctor should be fending off with a box of Kleenex.

The story starts a strange light in the sky, the disappearence of one of the lighthouse keepers, The Doctor and Leela arriving around 1902 at the lighthouse on Fang Rock surrounded by fog and stormy weather. This is Who at it's moody best and full of suspence. the story is well written which is surprising given the fact that it was a last minute replacement. The original story was to be a vampire story but was sacked due to the fact that the BBC was getting ready to run it's own version of Count Dracula. The vampire story would be rewritten as State of Decay in the show's 18th season. This story was based partly on a poem which The Doctor reads at the very end.",1211414400,3,841,4.329113924050633

Rutons are slime creatures (bright green blobs!) who are of superior intellect and who can morph into any form, including human form.

Well, it's not long before the Rutons begin messing with the lighthouse light and as the chief engineer goes to the lower level to inspect the generators, the Ruton snuffs him. It's at about this time that Doctor Who and his female sidekick show up and, from that point forward, it's the Time Lord and his human associates against the Ruton.

It sounds like there's not much here but this is a very good episode. You'll love how the Ruton yells everytime he gets temporarily zapped by The Doctor. It's a real hoot!

But then one day, I finally gave in to temptation when I finished school early, and bought Fang Rock.

That started my addiction to Doctor Who.

I watched all four episodes straight through, and I was transfixed by the whole thing. If you want to be picky, the story is sketchy in some parts, but not when you're just watching the story like a regular viewer (and not some person who likes to pick apart the entire thing and dissect it- talk about sucking the fun out of everything). And I was surprised to learn that the ""Exterior shots"" weren't actually location lighthouse shots.

One of Who's very best. Considering it had to come after Talons of Weng-Chiang, you couldn't have asked for a better story to try and follow it.",1197936000,2,906,4.445783132530121

The extras were mostly good too, though the most interesting to me (the piece on Dr. Who collectables) was disappointinly brief.

The DVD loses a star for one reason.  The commentary track.  I usually enjoy the commentary tracks, but this one annoyed me to no end due to Terrance Dicks.  THere were THREE people doing commentary, but to listen to it, you would have guessed that Terrance was alone in the studio.  He rarely let the other two get word in edgewise (sometimes even interrupting them in mid-sentence). Lovely Louise is quite soft spoken, so her comments, when she did manage to squeeze one in, were sometimes hard to hear. And much of what he had to say was virtually irrelevent to the story at hand.

1199077,5,B00000AOAH,"A sudden, unnatural fog should be anybody's cue to run for their life; in the make-believe world of TV and film, anyway, it always precedes something wicked coming this way. Of course, this assumes somewhere to run to, and what makes ""The Horror of Fang Rock"" stand out among the many great episodes of ""Doctor Who"" that loosely translate the motifs and themes of horror into a science fiction idiom is its sheer claustrophobia. The helpless sense of being trapped at stiflingly close quarters with something murderous and frightful, utterly cut off from the outside world, unable to even see whatever it is that's picking folks off one by one--all of this successfully gives this storyline a very palpable sense of tension and dread. The tiny rooms and single winding stairwell of the lighthouse are horribly perfect in this regard. And memorable. These are images which stuck with me for years after I watched this show as a teen, and they still do the trick years later even if the alien villain, when finally revealed, looks a little funny and moves a little slowly by today's standards. The fact that he (she? it?) is a Rutan, whom we've heard of previously as the Sontarans' enemy but never actually seen before, is also a clever touch.

For all the horror movie motifs, too, the eeriest thing about this story may well be its moral neutrality. There are seven supporting characters altogether, three lighthouse crewmen and four stranded survivors from a ship that wrecked in the fog. Some of them are annoying or downright greedy and nasty, some are warm-hearted and generous and very likable, but all alike are targets of the Rutan's malice and meet an ugly fate regardless. Even some of the nicer characters I figured would make it through alive bit the dust, to my surprised dismay. I guess nothing's quite as horrifying as cold, stark realism. As for the main characters, ""Fang Rock"" comes along close to the midpoint of Tom Baker's time as the Doctor, and by now his take on this character is well-defined and fully developed while yet very fresh and energetic. His oddball eccentricity and air of moral authority are finely balanced, he's funny and serious all in good measure, and watching this makes it easy to see why the fourth Doctor is often cited as many people's favorite. And if you have a soft spot in your heart for the Doctor's traveling companion, Leela, this storyline really showcases her character in a great number of classic moments. Here she wields her knife as bravely as ever and gloats boisterously at the Rutan's demise, here she startles the early-20th-century sensibilities of the other characters while befuddled or aggravated by their civilized naivete, and most of all she displays a natural quick-witted intelligence that trumps any of the disadvantages of her neolithic education.

For that matter, excellent storytelling, fine acting, and good directing together all trump budgetary limitations any day, and in that regard ""The Horror of Fang Rock"" is a classic example of ""Doctor Who"" at its very finest. Thrills, chills, comedy, tragedy, science, superstition--all crammed together in one claustrophobic little package.",1176422400,,3165,4.992424242424242

""Horror of Fang Rock"" ranks up there in the top ten for me.  I'm not sure why the extras keep talking about how chopped together everything was.  Sure, characters are introduced just to be killed off, but it's a freakin' Agatha Christie knock-off story.  That's what she did!

Tom Baker was about half way through his take on The Doctor with this one, and the commentary track talks about how he was getting out of control.  Louise Jamison, the lovely and talented actress who was Leela, gives us the lowdown on a scene where she says she came to her breaking point with Tom.  After he entered a scene too early not once, not twice, but three times, she kept stopping the tape and saying, ""That's not the way we rehearsed it.""  Finally, Tom entered at the right time and let Louise finish her lines.  Afterwards, she went to apologize and Tom told her, ""Think nothing of it.  It's quite alright.""  She swears that single act and moment saved their working relationship.

Louise also remarks that the fans always site this, or ""Talons"" as their favorite Leela episodes.  She was a great character never given a proper send off.

The other extras are quite cool.  A doc on the BBC's first female director, a look at the writer of the episode, and some stills and storyboards round out the single disc.

The BBC Restoration Team does a great job with these.  I can hardly wait to have all the surviving ""Who"" on dvd on my shelves.",1152144000,3,1632,4.493197278911564

1199083,5,B00000AOAH,"""Horror of Fang Rock"" is one of ""Doctor Who""'s creepier entries.  It proves that a story made on styrofoam sets, with a monster so poorly made that the props kept melting under the studio lights, can still be edge-of-your-seat viewing.  The TARDIS lands on a rocky outcrop under a lighthouse on the same night that an alien invasion fleet's advance scout crash-lands into the sea.  A team of doomed lighthouse keepers, derived from a sub-Coleridge turn-of-the-century ballad, falls easy prey to the shape-shifting, electricity-wielding creature, as does a yacht full of bickering aristocrats also stranded on the isle.

The story opens the 4th (and exact middle) of Tom Baker's seven seasons as the Doctor.  As a midway point to the Baker years, ""Fang Rock"" is intriguing in that it not only hearkens back to the gothic horror of his earlier years, but also serves as a window on the series' future mayhem, when Baker the actor would start acting against the scripts and run amok of the producers' control.  The DVD release pays detailed attention to Baker's on-set flareups, while demonstrating how he could still produce great on-screen moments when working with the right people -- actress Louise Jameson and director Paddy Russell.

The commentary track sizzles with tales on on-set strife generated by Baker, if you're into learning that stor of thing.  Jameson (companion Leela) provides excellent audio, balancing detailed production anecdotes with an intelligent critique of the story, almost 30 years later.  She gives a far more satisfactory origin of the name ""Leela"" than did Leela's creator, writer Chris Boucher, on the ""Robots of Death"" DVD some years back.  Terrance Dicks, always a hoot on DVD, lavishes praise over elements of his own script, while laughing off other elements of the story.  If he likes a cliffhanger (the end of Part Three, a funereal Baker oratory), he takes full credit; if he thinks the cliffhanger landed on the wrong beat (the end of Part Two, when two characters awkwardly embrace against an off-camera scream), he'll cheerfully blame the director.  Third wheel John Abbott, who played the youngest of the lighthouse keepers, has neither lot to do in the story nor to say on the commentary track, but he does give an interesting account of what it was like for a rookie actor to intrude on Baker's turf.

The best of the extra features is the 35-minute documentary on Terrance Dicks' ""Who"" career, featuring interviews with producer Barry Letts, old series writer Louis Marks, and current series writer Paul Cornell.  Cornell gives a great breakdown of what made the ""Fang Rock"" script work so aggressively well (""The story has three McGuffins... and two of them are used to defeat the third"").  DW book editor Peter Darvill-Evans, who looked nothing at all like I imagined (more like Ric Ocasek than Charles Dickens), describes Dicks' contribution to several decades' worth of DW novels.  The closing credits feature a fabulous montage of every iteration of the Dicks-coined phrase ""reverse the polarity of the neutron flow"", against Jon Pertwee's observation that you could sing the line to the tune of ""The Sailor's Hornpipe"".

Now that ""Doctor Who"" has graduated into the 21st century and is working on its second season of new episodes, with modern production values and British TV's most celebrated writers, an episode like ""Fang Rock"" can easily sink into irrelevance alongside last season's gothic horror fests ""The Unquiet Dead"" and ""The Empty Child"".  However, aided by the usual wonderful set of extra features, this DVD reminds those of us who've been in the ""Who"" fandom game for a while just how we got here in the first place.",1139702400,29,3683,5.029605263157895

The mystery inspired Wilfred Wilson Gibson to compose the wonderfully macabre ""Flannan Isle"" (read it at [...] from which the Doctor quotes the last lines of the episode, in that sepulchrul basso profundo voice that was perhaps Tom Baker's greatest contribution to the character: ""Of the three men's fate we found no trace/Of any kind in any place,/But a door ajar, and an untouched meal,/And an overtoppled chair.""",1138233600,3,650,5.074766355140187
1199086,5,B00000AOAH,"If you're like me, you'll remember watching DOCTOR WHO every day on PBS, unable to resist tuning in again after the previous day's nail-biting cliff-hanger.  If that sounds like you, then this DVD is a must-buy.  This one's an excellent example of what DOCTOR WHO did best,  and why it kept so many of us entertained for a half hour every afternoon.

DOCTOR WHO was never a lavish production, and it was always best when it knew how to work with its limitations.  It never had a big budget or gigantic sets, but this adventure shows how that was used as an advantage.  In this one, a small cast of characters gets trapped in a spooky haunted lighthouse, with a monster slithering in the shadows, killing them one by one.....  The Doctor has to figure out how to defeat the monster, while the body count starts climbing.  It's a classic recipe for suspense, well-executed - and I'd seriously reccomend this to many modern, over-financed film-makers as an object lesson in how to do that right.  It doesn't hurt that the actors are all top notch (especially series stars Tom Baker and Louise Jameson),  and that they're given some great snappy dialogue.  This is supposedly a science fiction show,  but the result is some great combination of horror, murder-mystery, and Masterpiece Theatre.

The picture and sound quality are amazing, considering how old these shows are.  But I honestly found some of the DVD bonus material took away a little of the show's excitement by examing it in more detail than I wanted to know.  If you're at all interested in production trivia, you'll probably love the lengthy interviews with the production crew, and the technical notes -  but I thought they took away some of the 'magic' of the show, even more than seeing the strings holding up a  spaceship.

And, while I thought it was cute,  I didn't see the relevance of the sketch starring the little puppet fox.

Its obvious, watching it nowadays, that DOCTOR WHO was made in a very different time and place than the one we live in now, here in 21st Century USA.  But no matter what's changed in television and technology, this show is still exciting, and loads of fun to watch.  It's even better on DVD, because there's none of that awful waiting for tomorrow to see how each cliff-hanger resolves itself.  If you're like anyone in my household, you won't be able to resist watching it all in one go.",1129161600,4,2387,4.657894736842105

1199088,5,B00000AOAH,"The penultimate pair of releases for 2005 in the Doctor Who catalogue brings together two stories made almost a decade apart from two different eras of the Doctor's long running saga. But both The Mind Robber and The Horror of Fang Rock do have a connection is so much as they come from troubled periods of the show's history.

The older adventure, The Mind Robber, was the second story from Patrick Troughton's final season as the intrepid Time Lord. Having spent three years in the role during the era when the show was almost continually on air, Troughton was tiring of the punishing schedule of turning out a weekly episode and in addition the show itself was considered by the BBC to have run it's natural course. Ratings were beginning to dip and viewer satisfaction with the series was waning. And yet, despite the rather lacklustre atmosphere surrounding the show, The Mind Robber proved to be one of the most innovative and original stories ever created for the show. Set in the world of fiction, this story really highlights the creativity of the production team and is a very unusual and brave attempt to do something well beyond the normal sci-fi genre. Visually, the show is astounding and even with the very limited budget, studio space, monochrome broadcast and technology; the land of fiction created by the designers is really very effective. Introducing characters from fiction that can only speak the lines of their text and conjuring up disturbing images and problems for the Doctor and his companions to solve, the show really is quite complex and works very well.

That's not to say there aren't challenges. Originally commissioned as a six-part story, the writer struggled to make it barely fill the amended requirement of four episodes. At the last minute, a fifth episode was needed, so the show's script editor (and later producer) Derrick Sherwin had to tag on another stand-alone episode to open the adventure, using nothing but the regular cast and the Tardis set. Subsequently, each episode runs for well under the normal twenty-five-minute length, with episode five coming in under seventeen minutes in length. At least the tedium of some of the longer six-parters is avoided! Frazer Hines was struck down with chicken pox before episode two recording could begin and producers came up with a truly brilliant way of replacing him with another actor for an episode and a half. Plus there are the usual goofs, continuity errors and fluffs that make the black and white era of Doctor Who so charming, but all in all, it really works very well.

The same can be said for The Horror of Fang Rock, the companion release made almost a decade later and featuring Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor. Opening the show's sixteenth season, Baker's fourth, this story was penned by Terrance Dicks, who although an infrequent writer for the show, as the script editor on the show from the final Patrick Troughton days through the entire Jon Pertwee era, he is probably the most prolific writer associated with the show. Always able to pen a script at short notice, this story was pulled together in record time when his earlier script (about vampires) fell through. Set entirely in a lighthouse and it's surrounding rocks, the claustrophobia of the piece is wonderfully atmospheric. Rather `Agatha Christie' like in it's set up, the story deals with the sudden one-by-one murders of the characters as the Doctor and his companion Leela try to work out the alien menace attacking the crew.

Although the season opener, this was the second story recorded in this block and is the first to go out under the production aegis of Graham Williams. Williams had been brought into the show when Philip Hinchcliffe had moved on after three years at the helm and arguably had taken Doctor Who to new heights and overseen it's most successful period. His reign had been deemed too controversial by the BBC and Hinchcliffe left the show on a ratings and critical high but not with much BBC support. Newcomer Williams had a very different view of the show and seemed to prefer slapstick and whimsy to the darker production style of Hinchcliffe. Williams certainly encouraged the playful side of Tom Baker who never took the role seriously from this point forwards and became more and more outrageous in his performance and dominant of the show. But this was early days and is certainly superior to much of what came later.

The restoration of the master tapes is as always flawless, with the earlier story being ""vidfired"" to recreate the original broadcast quality. Both stories have a number of extras included on the disc, most notably two truly interesting retrospectives of Terrance Dicks and the making of The Mind Robber. The commentaries are perhaps not as enjoyable as other releases, particularly for the earlier story featuring Frazer Hines & Hamish Wilson (Jamie), Wendy Padbury (Zoe) and director Michael Ferguson. It must be hard for the crew to recall what is happening almost forty years after the story was made, so this is forgivable, and Dicks, Louise Jameson (Leela) and a guest actor do a good job on the later story. Other extras about the careers of Frazer Hines and Paddy Russell are also quite interesting. The most bizarre inclusion is a sketch from another BBC classic ""The Basil Brush Show"" which seems to have no relevance at all to the Mind Robber or the era, other than it features a Yeti, seen in Doctor Who a year before this release. But it's a silly piece of nonsense that's certainly highly enjoyable.

All in all, a good pair of releases, but with only three more Troughton stories in the archives available, I think we'll be looking for more classic Tom Baker releases to fill the gaps in future issues.",1126310400,,5740,4.8520408163265305

Besides that, it's one of my favourites because it's a great story during one of the best times in Doctor Who...Tom Baker as the Doctor and Louise Jameson as Leela, his companion.
Just the fact that the entire story takes place in a lighthouse was a stroke of brilliance. It's a perfect setting for this horror-laced story, brimming with tension and suspense a-plenty. The entire cast gives great performances and there are some classic Tom Baker moments: The survivors or a ruined ship take refuge and start to bicker amongst one another, and the Doctor is just sitting there amidst it, until he suddenly interrupts: ""Just a moment! We haven't been introduced!"" and then slumps back in his chair. Additionally, later on in the story, he returns to the survivors and says, in his usual maniacal fashion, ""Gentlemen, this lighthouse is under attack and by morning we might all be dead. Now, who's interested?"" Classic stuff, to be sure.  Not to mention we finally see the nemeses of the Sontarans, the Rutans.
I would heavily advise this story to anybody looking for a primer in not only the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who, but Doctor Who in general.

1199094,5,B00000AOAH,"In one of Tom Baker's best performances as the Doctor, Horror of Fang Rock has nearly everything a fan of the series could want: snappy dialog between the Doctor and his quasi-reformed savage companion, Leela; a menacing and thoroughly cheesily-done up enemy; a well-written and executed story lacking silly tangents; and a piece that fits well within the overall Dr. Who universe.
In this episode, the Doctor's usual poor navigation skills land the Tardis not in Brighton for a holiday but upon an isolated lighthouse isle in the middle of a supernatural fog--just in time to witness a shipreck and the mysterious deaths of various members of the lighthouse crew and crash survivors.
The Doctor soon finds out that he culprit is a Rutan, the enemy of the big-headed Sontarans but no friend to humans or timelords (how a mass of glowing green jelly ever built a tremendous space fleet is beyond my comprehension, but I guess a monster with a head and arms wouldn't be scary enough).  Leela's antics are hillarious as she plays the role of the savage before Victorian Brits quite well, offering to wear men's clothes while hers dry, holding a woman at knifepoint, and general skulking about and waspishness.
The story fits well within the episodic length without diverging onto silly tangents (see perhaps the Stones of Blood from the Key to Time series for a perfect example of said failing) amd encapsulates a rather entertaining story.  Certainly one of the best Leela episodes and one of the better during Tom's tenure as well.

1199095,4,B00000AOAH,"Season 15 opens with what has been aptly described as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians set in a lighthouse in the early days of the 20th century.  Vince Hawkins, an amiable enough young man and one of three employees at a lighthouse on Fang Rock, sees an object fall towards the sea.  Three things happen immediately after:  One, there's a ""fog coming up here like it's nobody's business.""  Two, Ben, the electrician, is electrocuted.  Three, the TARDIS arrives with the Doctor and Leela.
Reuben, the stout oldster of the group, is initially suspicious of the Doctor and Leela, but when she tells the Doctor of a glowing creature she saw, he attributes it to the Beast of Fang Rock, which according to legend, killed two lighthouse employees and drove one mad back in the 1820's.  He prefers oil to electricity, as the lights keep playing up, and has that experienced instinct of looking at the sky to see if there's going to be any fog.
Ben's body then vanishes, but before long, comes another crisis.
A yacht crashes aboard the rocks after one of the electricity foul-ups.  The survivors are the arrogant Lord Palmerdale, a millionaire and crook, Colonel Skinsale, an MP who gave Palmerdale inside information in exchange for tearing up his IOU's, Adelaide Lesage, Palmerdale's high-strung secretary, and Harker the coxswain.  It is he who finds Ben's body, which has had a post-mortem done on it.  There then follows probably the highest casualty rate of any Who story.
Great dialogue by the Doctor:  ""localized condition of planetary atmospheric condensation caused a malfunction in the visual circuits."" He then gives the simpler answer:  ""We got lost in the fog.""  To the members of the yacht in the crew room:  ""Gentlemen, I've got news for you.  This lighthouse is under attack and by morning, we might all be dead.  Anyone interested?""  Leela to Palmerdale:  ""You'll do as the Doctor instructs or I'll cut out your heart!""

Trivia:  As Louise Jameson complained of the brown contact lenses she had to wear, the end of the story did away with the necessity of that accoutrement.

1199096,5,B00000AOAH,"One of the signs of a great TV series is how it can cross genres and use it's characters to produce stories of differing flavor. This episode is essentially Dr Who as a period Creature Feature that is as entertaining as anything Hammer films ever made, tossing Baker's Who and Leela (always my favorite of the Doctor's companions) onto an isolated lighthouse island where the indigenous lot are killed off one by one by the fabled Creature of the Rock. The formula of the story follows that of a standard horror flick -- a group of people are trapped in an isolated place they can't escape by something that takes a feindish pleasure in killing them off while generating terror. And as with the best of the Who episodes, what makes us care about them is the attention to charictarization, even if they do border on stereotypical roleplaying. I still remember this story creeping the heck out of me as a youngster and was pleased to see that it still holds up after all the years. Other than a rather goofy shot of the Creature crawling up the side of the lighthouse, the effects shots in this episode are remarkably convincing, especially the inspired ""Creature's perspecive"" views. This is an episode that relies more on plot and atmosphere than gimmicks and dopey space weapons, and it's a nice change of pace. And then there is Leela ... this is the episode that finally gave Louise Jameson a reason to shed the brown contact lenses she had been wearing to cover her beautiful blue eyes, and if I might say Leela never looked better than in black trousers and that wonderful, figure fitting sweater Vince manages to dig up for her. Even without her delightfully skimpy animal skins this manages to be an enteraining ""adult"" episode that I have a very soft spot for, though it might be downright scary for younger viewers.

I disagree most wholeheartedly with all of these sentiments.  Adelaide was just a poor naive girl caught in a situation far beyond her comprehension; and how can we hold it against her that it is?  She has never been shipwrecked before, she has probably never been soaking wet and cold before, she has ""never seen death before"" (for which Leela so disparages her), she has certainly never encountered a haunted lighthouse, Rutan, Time Lord, Companion, or anyone else of a non-human persuasion... I have always wanted to put my arms around her very tightly and reassure her as best i can.  But no one in the story ever does; they leave her alone and terrified in that little room, Leela hits her, the Doctor orders her back and forth like a naughty house pet...  I have always thought this story showed the doctor in a more negative light than any other, and I always thought it rather nasty of the story to kill off poor pretty innocent bystander Adelaide without a tear shed.  And that's what i think.",982108800,3,1365,4.588477366255144
1199098,4,B00000AOAH,"""Horror of Fang Rock"" is a wonderful example of what can be achieved on a shoestring budget. While Doctor Who's lack of funds mostly resulted in embarrassingly poor special effects, this story is a triumph of  minimalism (OK, there are a few poorly realised scenes, but they're largely  incidental). Set on the craggy Fang Rock and its lighthouse, the story  consists of only a few sets, which work to effectively maintain a  claustrophobic atmosphere and build a sense of siege. That is not the  story's only strength. It is well written and acted. Tom Baker and Louise  Jameson both excel themselves in their roles of the Doctor and Leela, while  the supporting cast are mostly well portrayed. Colin Douglas's Reuben is  perhaps a little too stereotypical of the crusty, veteran sea-dog, but not  excessively so. The combination of characters could also lead to  accusations of class cliches. The young keeper, Vince, and the seaman  Harker are both working class men with big hearts, whereas the upper class  trio of Lord Palmerdale, his secretary Adelaide and Colonel Skinsale, are  all truly despicable individuals. (A truly interesting scene is when the  Doctor announces that Skinsale's death was honourable, when it was anything  but. It's a compassionate side to the Time Lord, who in a very small way  re-writes history to protect a man from posthumous humiliation.) However,  the characters don't just fit into boxes, and the class divisions seem  feasible. Plotwise, the story remains taut and engaging. Suspense builds up  through the story - the brief glimpses of the alien only serve to build  this atmosphere - and, for once, the unveiling of the enemy does not  disappoint and there is a satisfying conclusion. There is only one part to  the story which demands a cry of ""cop-out"". When the Doctor  announces they are all trapped on the island (after Skinsale destroys their  only form of communication), he could easily have bundled everybody into  the TARDIS and removed them from danger. It is just waiting there on the  island; perhaps a plot device of making it inaccessible would have made  this a bit more believable. However, that is the only true complaint I have  with this story, and a small one at that. ""Horror of Fang Rock""  is an excellent production. Very watchable and highly recommended.",962323200,2,2322,4.973958333333333
1199099,4,B00000AOAH,"'The Horror of Fang Rock' is thematically closer to a ghost story than typical science fiction.  Trapped in a lighthouse off the coast of England, Leela and the Doctor are firmly in Sherlock Holmes mode as their companions  are bumped off one by one.  However, the only truly tragic aspect of this  video is the appearance of the very cheesy alien near the end - it looks  like a boiled sweet covered in saliva.  But you don't watch Doctor Who for  high-quality special effects - you watch it for charismatic acting and  inventive storylines, and this story has both.  Recommended.",958953600,,581,4.73
1199100,5,B00000AOAH,"This story takes place in lighthouse which is having a alien visit the area! The Doctor and Leela arrive  and a yacht is stuck on the end. Someone or something is killing the humans on the island. The Doctor and Leela  confront the alien and destroy it! The sad part of this story is all the  humans die(not Leela). Also in this story Leela change her eye color at the  end of the story! The mood of this story is tense because we are stuck  within the walls of the lighthouse during most of this story! it is also  similar to the story of ""Ten Little Indians""( i forgot the author  , know from one of my doctor who books it's based on this story! it still  creepy after the first time i saw it ! It also has one of my favorite  Doctor in it Tom Baker!",953856000,,752,4.027027027027027
1199101,5,B00000AOAH,"Even Leela's typically affected dialog style doesn't detract considerably from this eerie tale of alien carnage. The acting is superb (by Dr. Who standards), and the claustrophobic lighthouse setting contributes to a  feeling of frenzy as the situation becomes increasingly desperate. Tom  Baker is at his best here, still taking a far  less comedic approach to the  character than in later seasons. A strong supporting cast, well written  script, and top-notch set make this episode an essential purchase for any  self respecting Doctor Who fan.",950486400,,546,5.364705882352941
1199102,5,B00000AOAH,"The Doctor (Tom Baker version) and Leela arrive at a lighthouse which is receiving a mysterious visitation.
This is a well-written and tense story.  The lighthouse provides an excellently isolated location and there  are plenty of strong characters who become trapped together in  claustrophobic surroundings.  The electricity-shooting alien is nicely  symbolic, an embodiment of the fear people had of the newly-introduced  concept of electricity at the turn of the century, the era in which this  adventure is set.  A must-see.",949536000,,529,5.525
