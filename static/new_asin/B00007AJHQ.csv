1803864,1,B00007AJHQ,"I ordered this DVD expecting a low-impact workout based on traditional hula. I did not expect this weird hybrid dance incorporating the mashed potato and other totally non-hula moves (that are high impact and bouncy) set to really hokey music (Hula Rock Momma...gak!).
While you do get some introduction to each of the hula steps, they really aren't broken down totally...you just have to hope for the best.
On the tiny bit of good side, the other production values are decent...this production company seems to like to have the intructor do a voice-over, rather than actually talk during the workout, but I think the purpose of this is (as I found in the special features section) that you can turn off the voice track and just have the music. But with music this hokey, who'd want to do that? The setting is gorgeous and the instructor is obviously a real hula dancer, but I was expecting something more traditional and not some bizarre hybridization with country linedancing.
I'm returning my set, because I cannot do high-impact workouts due to an  injury. So if you're looking for low-impact, look elsewhere and if you're looking for anything resembling traditional hula, again look elsewhere.",1049760000,53,1198,4.960199004975125
1803865,3,B00007AJHQ,"If you're expecting to learn traditional hula from a beautiful island woman to traditional Hawaiian drums, you will be as shocked as I was.  Instead you will find a Drag performer teaching you the moves to country western music, your goal being to perform ""Hula Rock"".
If you can get past the very muscular male physique of Kali (wearing female attire), and you can tolerate the music you will find yourself learning some fairly decent hula moves, getting a very light and very low impact cardio/toning workout.  Once you get to the end and perform the dance with the lyrics to the country song, you'll ""get it"" and even have a little fun.
Overall I was disappointed, but I'm learning some moves and it's a nice rotation from intense target toning and aerobics.  It's also nice to look out into the waters of Hawaii rather than a set for a change.  I'm not kicking myself for buying it--after having some time to get used to it.",1048550400,12,928,4.572289156626506
1803866,5,B00007AJHQ,"I recently purchased the Hula Workout for Beginners and am having
a great time with this workout. I love the way it gives you step
by step instructions,making it very easy to learn and follow. At the same time it's a very energizing workout,& I am starting to
see and feel results already! I am in my 50's with lower back
problems and since starting to workout with Katie I'm experiencing no back soreness, and feel my flexibility has im-
proved. Katie is great to watch and follow, she has a fabulous
body (hope my body takes on same tone!).I actually look forward
to my workouts, I am never bored, I'm actually having fun exer-
cising with her,especially seeing the beautiful ocean background and listening to the upbeat music. I think this program is great
for all ages and levels of ability, it is safe, effective, & fun,
I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for something new,
reasonable, challenging, & FUN!

1803867,3,B00007AJHQ,"This hula workout video was fun and effective, strengthening thighs, abs and buns. It was unique, and the setting was lovely. Kili has a sweet voice and manner about her. For those looking to seriously study hula, though, keep moving. The music was really one song which was hula meets oldies meets old country. This would appeal to people who like oldies, but left me cold. Not all the moves are hula, and even includes the mashed potato. All in all, very little culture was included in this workout video. Good for belly dancers, already educated hula dancers,and other hip swivellers looking for a unique workout.",1042675200,18,616,4.820754716981132
1803899,4,B00007AJHQ,"This DVD is very low impact- there is only one short section that has any bouncy movements.  I adapt these or fast-forward through them, which makes it a perfect workout for someone like me, who experiences knee pain/shin splints/etc with most other exercise DVDs.

The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of reasons mentioned by other reviewers: the song does kind of sound like a country song, and some of the moves aren't traditional.  If you are very serious about learning traditional hula dance you should purchase a different DVD.  If what you want is a good low-impact workout, you should choose this DVD.",1149292800,3,629,4.743119266055046
1803900,1,B00007AJHQ,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.  I am out of shape and hoping to go back to what I did as a younger woman to stay fit - dance.  What I was expecting was an exercise video using the controlled, graceful moves of the hula dance.  You know tone your muscles, learn a beautiful dance and enjoy the gorgeous Hawaiian scenery.  What I got with this DVD - a bizarre version of Hawaiian country line dance complete with stomping feet and hokey music which the instructor calls ""Hula Rock"".  I made it about five minutes in and then switched to a different exercise DVD.  I love exercising to music and have exercise tapes and DVD's from Tanya Tucker's Country Workout to The Goddess Workout (bellydance) and was hoping to add the hula to my collection, but this isn't it.

There is no doubt looking at this woman's muscle tone that she gets a good workout, however anyone looking for a relaxing or beautiful dance in this video needs to look elsewhere.",1137888000,6,949,4.482558139534884
1803901,3,B00007AJHQ,"I didn't know what to expect from this DVD, but decided to give it a try.

Kili is a wonderful Hawaiian dancer, but there isn't enough repetition of the steps (especially for those of us who learn more slowly and need LOTS of practice).  Eight counts, add a movement. Eight more counts, add another movement.  I kept having to go back to get the practice I needed/wanted to do the steps correctly.

The music isn't at all traditional Hawaiian, but it's sort of fun and was an unexpected surprise.

Overall, despite gorgeous scenery and a skillful instructor, this workout is/was disappointing.",1120780800,6,593,4.8316831683168315
1803902,3,B00007AJHQ,"This is a 35-minute long workout that is very low intensity/no impact aerobics (30 min) with a slight warmup, cool down and stretch (5 min combined). You start the video with a preview of the dance you will learn, if you choose to watch it. I found this helpful beyond words, especially since this was my first time. I knew what I should be doing and how it should look. You are shown a few basic hula steps, then warm up briefly. You're ready to go.

You stack on the pieces of the dance, reviewing blocks at a time, as is typical with any aerobics workout. I got the impression that it was a hula-ized version of a typical slow aerobics routine - a modified slow grapevine, a couple lunges and the rest of the time, wow, you're really trying to circle those hips and coordinate which knee is to bend, which heel is to lift, and which hip should be up at any time.

I did sweat but it's a warm day. The first time around I wouldn't imagine you'd get much of a workout in; just trying to figure out what's going on. I thinkthat once you got this figured out and really went with the flow (literally - this does feel like you could make your body liquid once you got the steps right), it would be a good toning workout for all the muscles in your legs. Once I get the hang of it, I think it will really help my grace, balance, relaxation and flexibility.

This was a pleasant video to watch. You notice the instructor is always smiling and she directs you to always watch your hands. The scenery is gorgeous, to boot!

I didn't care for the music - more of a lazy country song than Hawaiian.

I am reaching a point in my life where I am sorry I quit dance lessons when I was young. My workouts are geared more to dance routines now than typical aerobics moves, so I really appreciate this. This is one to put something different into your typical routine - this is not your standby to do most days.",1118966400,10,1897,4.214876033057851
1803903,4,B00007AJHQ,"I tried this workout on a whim, but I was really surprised at what a great workout this actually was.  Now I'm not terribly in shape, but my legs, rear, and abs were sore (in a good way) for a couple days after doing the Hula Rock dance, so I know it did what it was supposed to do.  It was good not insanely over-the-top cardio exercise, and I did work up a bit of a sweat.  I had fun working out, and found myself concentrating on how to do the steps, so I wasn't so aware that I was actually exercising (always a plus in my book).

Some reviewers mentioned that the music made the workout less enjoyable, but I appreciated the music.  The lyrics helped me remember the dance routine and which steps came where.  I think if the music had been more traditionally Hawaiian, I would have lost my place rather easily.

I also liked that Kili broke the routine down into parts before tossing it at us all at once, *and* I liked that there *was* a full dance at the end of the workout, not just a bunch of moves that were never put into a full dance.  I thought the instruction was pretty easy to understand, and the camera was focusing on the right parts of Kili's body at the right times.

It's probably not for the wannabe Hula dancer, or for the Hula purist, and it does require a little bit of coordination (or the ability to laugh at yourself).  But if you want to try kind of a fun and different workout, then it might be worth a look.  It beats the torture of a stair-climbing machine!",1116115200,5,1489,4.189473684210526
1803904,5,B00007AJHQ,"I was looking for dance workout tapes and came across this one (Hula Basics) by Kili ....I thought I'd try it since I love everything Hawaiian and recently went to Maui. (in fact I have seen the fabulous show Kili was in on Maui...Ulalena..a must see!)

The workout tape exceeded my expectations....the setting is gorgeous...(must have been filmed in Wailea)...after you learn the basic moves, you can ""look past"" the instructor and look out to the beautiful ocean! I find that very relaxing, especially during the cool-down section.

The workout itself is very well done, easy to follow and gets you sweating but doesn't exhaust you. It's nice to mix this in with cycling, walking, other workouts. I find myself looking forward to doing this, which doesn't often happen with workout videos. The music is a bit corny, but I still think it's a lot of fun....I find myself humming the ""Hula rock"" song throughout the day....it's catchy after awhile. Kili is a superb instructor....very good dance and hula moves, with good teaching progression and a very pleasant, encouraging voice.

This one is one of the few that I will use repeatedly....Maholo, Kili, for a terrific tape! Loving it!

Much Aloha!",1108684800,3,1198,4.945273631840796
1803905,2,B00007AJHQ,"Yes, this video does teach a 'Hula Workout' and appears to have clear instructions.  However, the music is atrocious.  I was looking forward to some traditional Hawaiian music, the reason that I thought this workout would be fun, but the whole thing is set to a heinous track called ""Hula Rock"" which sounds like a lightly Hawaiian flavored takeoff of a fifties bee-bop style song.  I watched this once, and couldn't even get through the thing.  The music really ruins this experience.",1055376000,20,485,4.878048780487805
1803906,2,B00007AJHQ,"I, too, expected something quite different.  I wanted a fill-in tape to work my hips and thighs in a slow-paced manner.  I expected beautiful Hawaiian music, not the goofy Hula Rock.  Now I'm on an internet search for another hula tape, but it seems so far that Kili's tapes are the only ones in existence.  I go through the instructional parts where the steps are broken down and do this several times, fast-forwarding through the Hula Rock.  While I do learn the steps, I definitely didn't get my money's worth.",1052438400,13,513,4.655555555555556
1803907,5,B00007AJHQ,"If you are expecting the old hula style, don't buy this video. But if you would like something new, energetic and pumped up to work out too, then this is the video for you!!!

7974674,3,B00007AJHQ,This video could definitely be better as others have commented. The music is a mistake & the complaints reviewers have noted are valid. I would not recommend purchasing this video. Get a higher rated one from this series. This being 4 years after I bought it I pulled the dusty video out yesterday and played it on mute for the workout. I want to learn Hawaiian dance but can't go for classes right now. I'm out of shape so this 'Hula Workout' is helpful for me to get some strength for when I do take a class. I went ahead and ordered a higher rated video from this series today & look forward to practicing with Hawaiian music. The woman leading this workout is exotically beautiful & as fit as fit can be. I feel inspired just looking at her and the gorgeous Hawaiian scenery in the background.,1283990400,,797,4.391891891891892

7974677,1,B00007AJHQ,"When I purchased this video I was expecting to learn something about traditional hula but what I got was modern Hula. The video is set to beach type music in the form of ""Hula Rock Momma"". The moves aren't that easy to follow the first time through. I would actually suggest trying bellydance (like ""Bellydancing: The Sensuous Workout with Shamira"") first because some of the moves are similar and it does help. Now having said that I will admit that the video seems like it might give a good workout (once you learn the moves) as long as you don't mind it not being traditional Hula.",1167436800,4,584,4.518867924528302
7974678,3,B00007AJHQ,"It comes in 5.1 surround sound & just her at the beach. It has chapter choices, bonus features of her dancing an authentic dance & trailer for her weight loss DVD.

Most of the moves were authentic, such as the Kaholo (walking bellydance vertical figure 8), Ka'o (bellydance vertical figure 8), 'uniu (bellydance outward figure 8), hela (leg forward/back), 'uwehe (knees together & spread them), ami (small hip circle), kawelu (step forward w/half figure 8).

She's in great shape, good cleear voice, seemed nice & straight forward no small talk except to give her many good cues. She teaches the step first in it's most simple/bare bones in 1/2 time, then slowly speeds it up & then building up the hips, then the arms to it's graceful finish. The music seems like a fusion of native Hawaiian & american country twang, not bad, decent beat simple & goes with the learning.

The bad part that everyone hates is the dance routine you learn tells a story like all hula does & this one is a simple one but uses 60s american music & a couple mashed potatos in it. This is only about 15% of the dance, but kinda kills it a bit. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.

After a 4 min intro including seeing the dance of what you will learn, is a 5 min warm up with some basic stretching & also learning some of the basic steps like the Kaholo & K'ao until your hips turn to stone ;-) It ends with a 5 min cooldown w/some yoga poses & back stretches & other muscles stretched for a full 38 min. [...].

Her new ""Island Girl"" hula workouts are more authentic. Just like her other ones, you get a great workout, your abs burn, your hips, legs get a nice workout. It's all authentic dance moves with some added quick squats, etc. added in so you barely notice it for adding toning. The authentic drum Hawaiian music is beautiful & does keep you stimulted too keep going just like a dance/rock beat would.

I had no trouble following & learning the steps, there are plenty of dance DVDs that I have had trouble with, but she breaks everything down well & shows it slowly several times before speeding it up. She even cues YOUR left & right, not hers.

There's a trailer for her ""Hula Workout"" DVDs & another authentic Hula workout like this called ""Island Girl: Hula Abs & Buns"" at collagevideo.com",1151452800,10,2278,4.448441247002398
