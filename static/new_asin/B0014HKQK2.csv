3489789,5,B0014HKQK2,"This latest adaptation of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" is by the BBC (released in 2008, total running time is 150 mins).  The screenplay is by Deborah Moggach, and is directed by Jon Jones. This adaptation is the most faithful to Anne's ""Diary of a Young Girl"", reflecting the maturing of a young girl under harrowing circumstances, and exploring all her feelings and emotions in a credible manner.

The film stars Ellie Kendrick as Anna Frank, a feisty 13-year-old Jewish girl who finds her world turned upside down when the Nazis invade Holland in 1942. When her older sister, 16-year-old Margot (Felicity Jones) receives a summons from the Nazis to report for deportation, the Frank family, including father Otto (Iain Glen) and mother Edith (Tamsin Grieg) go into hiding in a Secret Annex above Otto's office. They are helped by a group of loyal Gentile friends, namely Miep Gies (Kate Ashfield), Mr Kleiman (Roger Frost), Mr Kugler (Tim Dantay), and Bep Voskuijl (Mariah Gale). The Franks are later joined by the Van Daans, comprising father Hermann (Ron Cook), mother Petronella (Lesley Sharp), and son Peter (Geoff Breton), and soon after by dentist Albert Dussell (Nicholas Farrell).

Living under such constraints puts a lot of stress on the occupants of the Secret Annex, and the story unfolds through Anne's observations (told partly through voiceovers) as the real Anne Frank had made these observations about her life in hiding in her beloved diary. Anne's chafing under the restrictions of living in hiding is credibly portrayed here(especially the conflicts with Mrs Van Daan and Dussell), as is her adolescent angst which comes across most clearly in her tense relationship with her mother, whom Anne felt did not truly understand her, in contrast to her beloved Pim/Dad whom Anne was very close to. The budding romance between Anne and Peter Van Daan is also explored with a great degree of sensitivity, and it is amazing to see these adolescents manage to connect on an intimate level, despite the harrowing circumstances they find themselves in. Anne's heartfelt conversation with her father is one of the most poignant scenes here and Anne's reflections on her parent's marriage is very insightful, especially from one so young. Ellie Kendrick delivers a finely nuanced performance as the adolescent Anne who harbors so many desires and ambitions, hopes for an unfettered and normal life, and the yearnings of a teenage girl. Her intimate observations regarding her body's cycle and all that it signifies are altogether poignant and heartrending to watch.

The sense of fear and danger is palpable from the first moments, and pervades the show. But there are also light-hearted moments to offset the bleak atmosphere, as when Mrs Van Daan refuses to eat cabbage because it gives her gas, and the comical teeth-pulling scene involving a certain fuss-pot and the dentist.  But, knowing their final fate (as anyone who is familiar with Anne Frank's story will know) makes this a heartrending watch indeed. This series ends with Anne, her family, the Van Daans and Dussell being led away by the authorities after their hiding place was discovered (they were betrayed, and the identity of the person/s who betrayed them has never been confirmed till today, though there are many books written on the subject and speculations on the identity of the person/s concerned). The fates of all eight Jews in hiding is also revealed.

I would highly recommend this latest adaptation of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" to anyone who has an interest in the Holocaust, who has read and loved Anne Frank's ""Diary of a Young Girl"", and also to teachers of History, may we never forget. There is also a bonus feature which is an interview with Anne Frank's cousin, Buddy Elias.

Note:
I have watched two previous screen adaptations of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"".  The 1959 B&W movie (total running time:180 mins) starring Millie Perkins as Anne Frank and Joseph Schildkraut as Anne's father, Otto.  Though this movie was well-acted and credibly portrayed the fears and frustrations of people in hiding, I felt the movie was wanting in terms of being faithful to the original source, i.e. Anne's diary.  This movie is not an altogether historically accurate representation of actual events. The Franks had gone into hiding before the Van Daans, but this is portrayed otherwise in the movie. Peter Van Daan [Van Pels] was extremely shy in real life, but his demeanor is portrayed differently here, and his romance with Anne is overly exaggerated in typical Hollywood style. This movie ends with the capture of the Franks' and their friends in hiding.

The second version I watched was ""Anne Frank - The Whole Story"" (Walt Disney Studio Release 2001 -total running time 189 mins) and is a well-acted and beautifully filmed movie based on Melissa Muller's biography of Anne Frank. The movie was beautifully filmed with great attention to period details and the excellent casting choices made this an engaging viewing experience. Ben Kingsley played the role of Otto Frank and Hannah Taylor-Gordon plays Anne Frank. Her resemblance to the real-life Anne is quite uncanny. Her portrayal of Anne is simply amazing - strong-willed, impetuous, candid, ambitious, and yet, underlying all that fierceness of spirit is a young girl on the brink of womanhood who yearns to be thought of as a woman and not a girl, and longs for freedom and love. This adaptation ends not with the capture of hidden Jews in the Secret Annex, but with the sisters in the Bergen-Belsen camp, and with their deaths.",1257379200,81,5571,5.005399568034557
3489790,5,B0014HKQK2,"This 2008 British 5-part miniseries of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK succeeds on so many levels. There is a primal reason why we need to hear this story time after time, and yet hope that we can somehow change the ending...

Anne Frank's wartime diary gave a poignant face to the Holocaust, an event unparalled in the annals of human cruelty. Deborah Moggach (the writer of the Keira Knightley version of PRIDE & PREJUDICE) casts a fresh eye over the original material, stripping away any possible shred of melodrama to reveal even more raw human emotion than seen in other versions of the story.

And newcomer Ellie Kendrick is nothing short of a revelation as Anne. Looking eerily like the real Anne at times, Kendrick brings her vividly to life with all the angst, fear, rage and humour that the role requires. The rest of the cast follows suit. I was especially surprised by how good Iain Glen and Tamsin Greig were as Anne's parents. There's a heartbreaking scene between Anne and her father--missing from other versions of the story--which had me absolutely floored.

It seems that each version of the story brings us closer and closer to the essence of the real Anne. This latest version is refreshing and raw in it's depiction of one of the most fascinating chapters in modern history.

Bonus features will likely include ""Rutka: A Diary of the Holocaust"" which introduces audiences to Rutka Laskier, a fourteen-year-old Holocaust victim whose own diary--written in the Polish ghetto of Bdzin--was only discovered and published in 2006.  This 50-minute doco was part of the UK and Australian DVD releases.",1247011200,33,1607,4.893382352941177

It was done at just the right level for a 13 year old viewer (little bit titillating.)  :)

One thing puzzled me althoug I know I am being pedantic! I have often wondered what Dickens Otto read in the annexe (I know he used it to perfect his English!) . I saw a copy of 'Pickwick Papers' and 'Sketches by Boz in the Anne Frank Huis, which seemed to answer my question. This BBC version said at one point that that Otto was crying over 'PIP's death' - but Pip in 'Great Expectations' doesn't die! Were they thinking of crossing sweeper Joe in 'Bleak House'. I am surprised this silly error got through - it lost me my concentration!

I though the depiction of Mr Dussel was really wonderful. Poor man. I wonder if people know that his girlfriend married him posthumously after the war? And she never really forgave Otto that Anne's depiction of him in the Diary was so completely lacking in understanding (although forgivable given Anne's age).

As expected from any Masterpiece Theatre production, the story is told with authenticity and high production values - the costumes, sets, lighting and filming are all top rate. The film captured the full range of emotions that played out in the annex in which the families were hidden for more than 2 years. I didn't know the final outcome of her story and intentionally avoided seeking out information that would spoil the ending for me. There is a build-up of relief as well as tension towards the end when they realize that the Normandy invasion is underway. Without providing any plot spoilers, I can only say that the film is indeed uplifting in some ways and certainly very emotional. Though it's not a comprehensive view of the atrocities suffered during the Holocaust, ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" absolutely provides an in depth and honest view of the families who spent a good portion of the war hidden away and waiting for it to end.",1434067200,,1076,4.698412698412699

Firstly, it is a BBC production and everyone has a British accent.  That took about 15 minutes to get used to because initially, I did not think it fit.  However, all the cast did a great job in their roles so you were comfortable with the interpretation of each character.

3489838,4,B0014HKQK2,"Many people encounter ""The Diary of a Young Girl"" in a school classroom. However, I went through my educational years without being assigned to read the Diary, and my first experience with it was a few weeks ago.

Having now finished the book, I still haven't fully recovered. Entering into the world of Anne Frank, while dreading the brutal truth of the Diary's abrupt ending, was a compelling, ultimately devastating experience.

As part of my process of dealing with the impact of Anne Frank's story, I've watched several good films: the excellent 1995 documentary ""Anne Frank Remembered"", ""Anne Frank: The Whole Story"" (a 2001 TV miniseries), and the subject of this review, ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", originally broadcast as part of BBC's ""Masterpiece Theatre"" series. (There was also a 1959 theatrical film called ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", a Hollywood-style romanticized version of the story, complete with a defiant, passionate kiss at the end.)

There are two versions of the BBC film - the original 150-minute miniseries shown on British TV, and a 100-minute American (PBS) version. These are sold here as 1-disc and 2-disc DVD options. I have the long version, and I saw the short one on Hulu. I'd say the 2-disc option is better, at least for serious devotees of Anne Frank. I especially liked the extra touches of humor and scenes showing sisterly interactions (both postiive and negative) beween Anne and Margot.

I found the BBC production superior to ""The Whole Story"" in several aspects. The initial flight to the Annex occurs during a driving rainstorm, as in the Diary...a detail that lends tension to the scene but is oddly absent from ""The Whole Story"". The music in the BBC version is unobtrusive, quietly moving, and suspenseful at times (I found the music in the other production a bit overdone). And, of course, there are the authentic voice-overs from the diary itself, which ""The Whole Story"" was not permitted to use.

One quibble is that I missed some of the dialogue due to the British accents and fast, sometimes sotto voce delivery of lines.

The BBC production features an outstanding cast. The then-17-year-old Ellie Kendrick, who plays Anne, amazed me. From the first scene, she was the charming, moody, articulate, acerbic 13-, 14-, and 15-year-old I'd come to know and love from the Diary. Her direct, unapologetic gaze lets you know she'll see everything, and her frequent frowns make you realize she won't like everything she sees. Whether falling in love or just anticipating the rare treat of a chocolate bar, she is utterly convincing, and when she's onscreen you can't take your eyes off her.

There's nothing sweet or saintly about this Anne Frank; she's a defensive, grumpy teenager who can't stand most of the old fogeys she's cooped up with. Her self-centered personality is emphasized, perhaps more than is historically warranted (for example, in the film she has never bothered to ask about Margot's plans for the future, whereas the diary makes it clear that she did so as early as 1942). You sometimes feel sorry for the other Annex residents, who had to deal with her on a daily basis - most of them, even the sweet Peter, tell her at least once that she thinks only of herself. Even her abandonment of Peter for her diary seems a bit cold, whereas in reality she grew out of her obsession with Peter when she realized he wasn't well-suited to be a partner for her. For the most part, though, the film's characterization of Anne, including her flaws, is consistent with what what we know of her personality from the diary and other sources. It's a risky choice in the film, but ultimately, Anne's humor and human reality win out; it's hard to love a saint, after all.

The film doesn't quite convey the growing maturity and spiritual depth that are so apparent in her diary entries. I didn't see a lot of change in Anne's character between the beginning and end of the film, apart from her determination to become a writer. Of course, there's a limit to what can be done in 150 minutes, and there's probably no way to do justice to the beauty and warmth of Anne's writings, since they couldn't spend half the film doing voiceovers.

Since Anne is not depicted as a heroic figure, the humanity of the other characters is not overshadowed. Otto Frank, played by Iain Glen, is the mild-mannered, nurturing father who sometimes struggles to understand and deal with his family, especially his strong-willed younger daughter. As Edith Frank, Tamsin Greig conveys the shock that Anne's mother experienced when she was forced to abandon her comfortable life for the constricted environment of the Secret Annex. She's haunted by fear, as well as longing for the daughterly love that Anne Frank did not feel, and would never feign.

The film (which was endorsed by the Anne Frank-Fonds, the copyright holder of the ""Diary"") is usually authentic in its account of historical events. Occasional embellishments flesh out the supporting characters in interesting ways. Margot Frank is given the opportunity to speak for herself (she says she is forced into the role of peacekeeper because Anne won't do it; she is tired of Anne ""sucking up all the oxygen""). Mrs. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel, the recipients of much criticism in Anne's diary, are given scenes in which their humiliation and anguish are shown. We see them as more human, perhaps, than Anne generally did. In other scenes, the bickering Van Daans provide expert comedy relief.

Anne Frank unleashed the full force of her anger and scorn on the dentist Dussel (a pseudonym in her rewritten diary version that means ""Dummy""). His family, who described him as a kind man, came to resent these passages and his depiction in the early film and theatrical adaptations of the Diary. Perhaps in the spirit of fairness, the film allows us to see his sorrow at the separation from his beloved fiance. And finally, when the worst happens, he shows his decency in a moment of tenderness toward Anne. In a heartrending scene, it falls to him to comfort the terrified girl when her Secret Annex is breached by the Gestapo.

One problematic departure from the Diary concerns Anne's hurtful letter to her father, in which she orders him to accept her relationship with Peter and leave her alone. The well-acted scene ends with Anne running from her father and rushing into Peter's arms. But from Anne's actual account, it's clear that she understood her father's pain and accepted his admonishment (""It's good that someone has finally cut me down to size...Not everything that Mistress Anne does is good!""). I feel that an accurate account of this episode would have illuminated Anne's waning infatuation with Peter, and illustrated her struggle toward maturity.

Another questionable element (to me at least) is the depiction of Anne at work on her diary when the Gestapo break into the Annex. This is not factual, of course; the last diary entry was written three days before the arrest. Perhaps the writer and director couldn't resist leaving us with Anne's oft-quoted words about people being truly good at heart (which is rearranged to come at the end of the cited passage). Instead of ending with what has now become a clich, I might have preferred Anne's true final words, in which she struggles with the themes of self-disclosure, self-contradiction, and sensitivity to criticism that are such constant concerns throughout the Diary. (Admittedly, though, juxtaposing the quote with the arrest scene may serve to purge the quote of its sentimental baggage; and the rest of the voiceover, in which Anne expresses her forebodings about the world descending into chaos, delivers a powerful emotional punch.)

The film's ending, the arrest scene, is expertly acted and staged and appropriately painful to watch. Despite the sincerity of the concentration camp scenes in ""Anne Frank: The Whole Story"", I am not convinced that a filmic portrayal of this material can adequately convey the awful reality. Perhaps such things are more effectively left to the imagination, as here.

Overall, this is a fine film, but Anne Frank cannot truly be encountered without reading her own words. Far from simple or childlike, the diary shows us the development and self-analysis of a brilliant, complex young woman, with more warmth and sympathy than could be shown in the film.

Anne Frank is more than a symbol of courage or an ""inspiration."" All the residents of the Secret Annex were courageous in a situation that demanded nothing less. Anne was difficult and endearing, kindly and cruel, cheerful and deeply troubled. She had many friends, but no one (certainly no childhood friend; not even her beloved father) could satisfy her voracious need for unconditional personal access and emotional intimacy. Finally and providentially, she began her diary and invented a confidante - ""dearest Kitty"" - who could provide the ""comfort and support"" she was to need so desperately after her happy world imploded in July 1942. She could not find a friend to talk to, but in the end she spoke to millions.

Much commentary on Anne Frank is fixated on the search for ""lessons"" for young people, or the symbolic meaning of her death. To be sure, we have much to learn from her story. Her diary is an essential Holocaust testament and an important part of Jewish history. But to me, Anne Frank is not just someone to meet in a high school classroom, nor is she a symbol of tragedy or human goodness. Arguments over possession of her symbolic legacy (Jewish Holocaust victim vs. universalized beacon of hope) threaten to overshadow the deeply human, vital young woman who gave the world the gift of herself.

The great merit of this film is its willingness to show us a real person, rather than an abstract ideal. Watch ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and read ""The Diary of a Young Girl."" Let Anne Frank speak to you. Come to know her and love her. And let her break your heart.",1398988800,2,9936,4.890142517814727

One should be thankful for what they have after watching this movie, and all trivial squabbles with family seem so utterly normal now.

An absolutely fabulous British miniseries that never puts a foot wrong from beginning to end. Shown in five segments, The Diary Of Anne Frank is so captivating, that without doubt, you will view all five in one sitting. It's that good!

Ellie Kendrick is mesmerizing as Anne, and Iain Glen and Tamsin Grieg also deserve the highest of praise, but the whole acting ensemble is wonderful, with characters so well written, and so realistically portrayed, that you will feel that you are there,living on a knife-edge of suspense.

All the heightened emotions of surviving in a cramped hidden apartment, with the threat of discovery, and all but certain death awaiting, are brought to the fore, but there are lighter moments of levity, hope and love, laced among the anger, jealously and frustration. In short, the gamut of emotions brought on by all too human individuals, living under unbelievable constant tension.

3489866,5,B0014HKQK2,"I've watched much of the Anne Frank video output in the past few months. If I could only watch one, this would be it. The production was outstanding and the casting was perfect.

This version will be most frequently compared to the Disney version of the Anne Frank biography starring Ben Kingsley as Otto Frank. The Disney version is based on an Anne Frank biography and its main advantage is that the story continues after the Germans arrest the people hiding in the ""Annexe.""

This movie is based on Anne's diary and the story ends when the diary ends -- with the arrest of the Frank family and their compatriots. (Actually, the story is extended slightly to show the actual arrest and then there is a crawl showing the fate of each of the 8 Annexe residents.)

This movie's strong point is superb casting (better across the board than the Disney movie, I thought) and its faithful recounting of the story told in the diary. I showed this movie to a fairly chatty class of high school freshmen who had been marginally interested in the book -- they were totally fixated by this movie.",1325548800,4,1086,4.587628865979381

And the other is just 'The Diary of Anne Frank' with 2 discs at 150 mins. I recommend getting the unedited version (it's about the same price).

This was originally a mini-series produced by the BBC, although I'm not sure why it was presented that way, because the whole thing is only 2 1/2 hrs. The unedited one is the full 5 episodes of the mini-series, and the other one is edited into one movie. This is the best adaptation of the story I've ever seen.

3489873,5,B0014HKQK2,"At first, I didn't think I'd like this film.  Although I thought they chose a good look-alike actress to play Anne Frank, I didn't care for the actress's nasally voice (she sounded like she had a clogged nose), which you hear narrated throughout the entire movie.  However, the story pulled me in right away and I got over it.

What I liked best about this movie is that you really feel what these characters are going through.  These people may have escaped imprisonment at a concentration camp, but they are nonetheless still imprisoned in cramped living quarters with limited freedoms.  They aren't allowed to go outside or look outside the window.  During long working hours downstairs, they aren't allowed to talk or move around upstairs.  To further give you a feel for how claustrophobic the situation must've been, the camera shots are kept mostly tight.

These circumstances would be difficult for any adult to endure, but for an active preteen like Anne Frank, it's especially stifling.  It's a shame how she's being denied a real childhood and then, as she's starting to mature into a young woman, having to do so while being trapped in this cage.
But the adults slowly start to crack, too.  I thought the actor who played Anne's father did an especially good acting job of trying to keep his composure for everyone else's sake.

This film moves swiftly along and held my interest 'till the very end.  The subject matter is depressing, but the people in it try to make the best of a horrible situation.  For instance, when they get new neighbors into their already cramped space, Anne gives one young man a tour as if she's giving a tour of a posh hotel rather than a prison.
The ending  moved me to the point where I began  sobbing into my palms.  Of course, I already knew what would  happen,  but I had gotten attached to these characters and seeing their fate played out like that only reminded me what a tragic waste the holocaust was.",1296777600,10,1951,4.654970760233918

I found the BBC's production, set in the family's actual hiding place in Amsterdam, was both accurate and insightful. Students delighted as they recognised dialogue from the diary and I feel the characters of all who hid in the Secret Annex with Anne were both well-rounded and believeable. The film's portrayal of Anne feelings of her journey through adolescence - the discovery of her changing body and her relationship with Peter - managed to shock and intrigue at times.  The identity with the students' own adolescent journeys was strong. This identity turned to a unanimous indignation and feelings of injustice about the plight of Anne, her family and others who hid with them for 2 years. The film's realistic depiction of their unexpected betrayal and capature, engendered a curiosity among class members to find out more about the historical circumstances that allowed such hatred to fester.",1292457600,27,1056,5.0

They captured the personalities and nuances of these individuals.

Caught up in events that would ultimately lead to their demise, I can't help but think what type of lives Anne and Margot would have led.  They had so much to offer this world.  Although Otto Frank lost his family, he had to have been proud of his daughters.  I would hope that this film will let people see what happens when bad ideas take hold in the world.

For people who don't mind when dramatization or biopics have altered events, then it won't be a problem, and you can safely ignore this review. ;)  If you do, read on...

The mother was very quiet, didn't really say very much, whereas when I read the diary I got the impression she was rather outspoken frequently and getting into many arguments, esp. with Mrs. van Daan (van Pel).

I thought it was quite pointless to change her reaction to the poem she received from her father on her 14th birthday. In the movie, they showed her focused on unwrapping a chocolate bar and then starting to eat it, while her father was reading the poem, but it was ""backgrounded""... only some of the poem was audible, while the zoom-in was on Anne with her chocolate bar. In the diary, she was really pleased with receiving the poem.

In this film, her relationship with Peter seemed to start much earlier than in the diary. And her first kiss was a bit more intense. In the diary it was a pretty quick kiss if I recall correctly, and not on the lips. In the movie, a kiss on the cheek, then to the lips for a few seconds, then she ran out of the room without saying anything. Some may consider that a minor change, but I think changing something like that is like changing part of Anne Frank's personality and values.

There was a scene where her mother spoke with her about her relationship with Peter. and tried to discourage her. But in her diary, her father was the one who had that conversation with her (though the conversation in the film didn't match up very closely to the conversation she had with her father in the diary).",1496707200,,1874,4.370689655172414
