1676708,3,B00005YUNE,They are good movies. The first one is a classic. I enjoy it and I'm glad to have it in my DVD collection.,1381190400,,106,3.652173913043478

1676711,4,B00005YUNE,"The Wishmaster series is a hidden treasure. When I first saw Wishmaster, I was skeptical; however, my concerns were dispelled. With a mixture of a real and the rarely known story of Persian Theology (Zoroastrianism); as well as great casting, I found the films very enjoyable to watch. Are they filled with blockbuster effects, and an Oscar level plot; well no, but it makes that up in originality and determination. The effects are very good for the budget, especially the make-up of the Wishmaster himself. The plot is structurally done well, and the dashes of comedy; while a little campy, will give you a smile. Some of the actors were well known, but most would be new to the average film viewer. The role of Wishmaster (In all 3 films)was played to perfection by Andrew Divoff. I could not see any other person playing the role of the The Djinn. The heroin of the film is played well by the sweet and lovely Tammy Lauren, who has equal screen time as the villain. Robert Englund makes a short but classic appearance; as well as, Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm of ""Phantasm"" fame. If you watch closely, you will also see a walk-on by the big little man, Verne Troyer. Lastly, a very short talking spot at the beginning and end by Ted Raimi (Darkman 1).

Overall, the films are all ""Cult"" films; complete with cult stars. However, this is in no way a bad connotation. Rather, I believe the Wishmaster series will stand the test of time as a Cult Classic.

Definitely watch, possibly buy. If you liked ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and/or ""Phantasm,"" you will enjoy the Wishmaster.

Just remember to be careful what you wish for!",1352246400,,1631,4.65625
1676712,5,B00005YUNE,"Wishmaster: Magically powerful. Supernaturally evil. The ancient entity known in human legend as Djinn can grant a person's wildest dreams. And in the process, it unleashes your darkest nightmares. The moral of this explosively terrifying, special-effects-powered, horror-fantasy spectacular: Be careful what you wish for! Wishmaster 2: When the legendary monster, the Djinn, is re-released, he begins he reign of terror, plunging the earth into horror and chaos. As the Djinn reaches his goal of a thousand captured souls, it is up to Morgana to stand between the world as we know it and a terrifying future beyond our darkest fears. Wishmaster 3: Horror goes to extremes with Wishmaster 3: Beyond the Gates of Hell, the goriest installment of the hit franchise yet. When Diana, a beautiful coed, discovers an ancient gem inside a mystical Persian case, she unwittingly releases the mercilessly evil ""Djinn."" The gut-slinging demon uses fiendish trickery to take the form of a professor in order to slice, dice and burn his way through the university staff and its students. If he can overpower Diana, his ""waker,"" and grant her three sick and twisted wishes, the very gates of Hell will open up and engulf the world in eternal damnation. With help from the man she loves, she must impale the bloodthirsty demon with a sword from Heaven to save herself and the entire world.",1277337600,6,1375,5.061674008810573

1676721,5,B00005YUNE,"The Wishmaster set of 4 movies are, or should be, classic horror movies.  They're a little campy for modern times, but still very good movies.
