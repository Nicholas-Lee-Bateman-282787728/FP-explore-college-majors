6131734,4,B00H4DV4ZG,"This was a good action flick in the vein of a lot of mid-to-late 70's fast car chase flicks. This one focuses on the Ridgerunner culture of shine runners and the Revenuers. You can see in some scenes the roots of modern Nascar/stockcar racing and Southern Moral code. Fairly family friendly by today's standards.

It is interesting to see many of the elements that would enter the spin-off show some years later: compound bows with dynamite, two cousins + the girl, the wise old morally uncompromising uncle, the Boar's Nest bar, etc.",1404518400,7,534,4.804347826086956
