I'm using them with my 9 year old who really struggles with numbers and basic concepts. She likes them.  We do make fun of the graphics.
I absolutely believe that these short lessons help comprehend math concepts.",1489536000,,438,4.7631578947368425
8132275,5,B000GH3PRW,"This set consists of four discs, each containing ten entertaining ten-minute computer animated stories illustrating various math concepts.

The characters in these stories are sympathetic, their adventures are interesting, and the math explanations solid and easy to understand.  Although my local library recommends this set for grades 2-4 (ages 7-9), my four year old absolutely loved this series, watched it over and over, and effortlessly absorbed a great deal of elementary math while being entertained.  Best of all, by doing a Google search for Star Maths (the name of the series in the UK), I found online suggestions for activities to enhance my child's understanding of these concepts.

The characters do have British accents, but they speak clearly and don't use slang, so neither of us had any difficulty understanding them.  Please note that because this is an older set, the 3D computer animation is a bit unsophisticated by current standards, but this did not detract from our enjoyment of the series.

I have happily recommended this set to other homeschooling families and it has been a hit with all of them.",1399075200,,2197,5.53134328358209

Only entertaining program and no tutoring, just a junk.
If the preview would have been given definitely I would not have bought it. I just lost $40.

Also, the DVD stops after playing for few minutes, not sure whether this problem with only these DVD pack or all the pack.

Demerits
**********

1. The voice of the Animation - Kids are unable to understand, annoying voice selection

2. Just one problem on each topic

3. After each problem a 3 minutes irritating music plays about the team that produced this (Who care this)

4. Price is tooooooooooooo much - $6 for all the 4 dvd's

5. Many more
