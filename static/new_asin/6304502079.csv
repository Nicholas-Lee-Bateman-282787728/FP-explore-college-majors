7873635,1,6304502079,"This review is for the GMI Vhs Release NOT the movie itself.. DO NOT CHOOSE THE GMI VIDEO RELEASE PRODUCT!! Received what looked to be new video, but tried on more than one vcr and it will not play properly at all!! The film is placed on tape wrong so that starts AFTER title & main cast, first thing you see on screen is where it is showing company name ""Fair Film with..."" and remainder of cast. It is also on a tape with no side label AND the tab that is supposed to be removed so can not accidentally record over the video is still present! Furthermore... playback is not just a tracking issue, much worse, tape rolls, tracking travels, video picture very washed out, so poor can barely read cast name writing. It's just an awful, awful version of this movie we were so looking forward to :( I will add pictures if can.",1456876800,,823,4.282051282051282

7873638,2,6304502079,"When he becomes a grandfather for the first time, a middle aged married Italian businessman (Vittorio Gassman) begins to feel life is passing him by. He embarks on an affair with an 18 year old vixen (Ann-Margret) but what started out as a fling becomes complicated when the affair turns serious and she insists he make a choice. It's either her or his wife (Eleanor Parker) and family. This tedious Italian sex comedy becomes quite annoying after awhile. Not only does Gassman's character sleep with Ann-Margret but he sleeps with her mother too! Meanwhile, Parker is so desperate to keep her husband that she looks the other way and pretends nothing is going on, better to have an unfaithful husband than no husband at all. Are we supposed to have empathy for these people? It must be an Italian thing. Gassman even won the David Di Donatello best actor award (the Italian Oscar) for his performance here. Ann-Margret takes time out from the adultery frolics to bump and grind to 60s Italian pop and body paint a dress on herself. Directed by Nino Risi. With Eleonora Brown (the daughter in De Sica's TWO WOMEN) and Giambattista Salerno.

The Madman DVD from Australia is a very good full screen transfer.",1336003200,,1207,4.77511961722488
7873639,4,6304502079,Die hard Ann-Margret fans are the only ones who will like this movie.  The copy I got has a sound track problem. The movie its self has a 50s quality look to it. It won't compare to any movie made today and Ann-Margret is the only redeeming quality to the movie.,977788800,10,262,4.137254901960785
