8033314,5,B0002VGTZM,"The great, incomparable premier danseur Rudolf Nureyev never built up close friendships or relationships in his too-short lifetime.  This trait was evident in this 50 minute story of the last 10 years of his life, spent living in a modest apartment in Paris, France, which he had chosen originally when offered a creative position with the Paris Opera Ballet, which he helped shape into a fine ballet company.  When he became extremely ill in the last year (1991-1992) and could no longer teach, the company dropped him, and after a brief stay in the Caribbean he chose to return to Paris to face the end.  He bravely assist-choreographed in one final company production, ""La Bayadere,"" which had been one of his own youthful successes, and for which he appeared onstage afterward (being helped to stand by several dancers) to a thunderous standing ovation and receipt of a medal from France, the joy on his face apparent.  This disc is a lovingly put together tribute to the once phenomenal talent that was Rudolf Nureyev, and those of us who were fans get a close personal look at this determined, proud, brave man - from his early days leaving his family and country behind, forging a new career out of nothing but unsurpassed talent, a stranger in many strange lands as he traveled the world from company to company, his erratic personal life which brought him no lasting relationships, and his brave refusal to give in to the ravages of AIDS which he fought stoically to the end.  A courageous portrait of a ballet legend.",1368057600,,1527,4.7908745247148286
8033315,3,B0002VGTZM,"I've seen this video a few times, as well as the one by Patricia Foy.  It's amazing to me that nobody was able to interest Nureyev in sitting down for multiple interviews to build a video of substance about his life and his influence on 20th Century dance.  This film is a little annoying to look at because they often obscure a clear view of the man with fuzz and keyhole techniques, so you don't get to see him teaching or demonstrating to the dancers at Paris Opera Ballet.  What a missed opportunity.  Maybe there are some archives as yet untapped, I certainly hope so.  I would have loved to see the right person engage this guy's interest for an extended conversation.  He was so smart, so witty, and had such good insights, yet almost none of that is evident in any of the three main biographical videos.  What a pity.",1294444800,4,825,4.423841059602649
8033316,5,B0002VGTZM,Best video yet on the life of the world's greatest male dancer.  A must for ballet devotees!,1286582400,,92,4.411764705882353
8033317,5,B0002VGTZM,A very important message that shows the ravages of AIDS. It shows one of the greatest athletic dancers of the age reduced to a mere skeleton of himself.,1271116800,,152,4.464285714285714
8033318,4,B0002VGTZM,"The subjects of artists and AIDS has never been discussed enough.  How do creative minds deal with the fact that their bodies are deteriorating?  How do artists handle a public that may want to know about their health more than their work?  Does an incurable illness spur creativity or hamper it?  These are all questions that have not been answered enough.

When Newsweek had a cover story on AIDS and the arts, they showed Nureyev on the cover.  They barely touched the gay issue and stated that Nureyev never spoke out much about his illness.  Either in the article or in comments to the editor, a close confidante said that Nureyev feared that someone would sue him for infecting them, as Rock Hudson's ex-lover did.  However, here, those who know Nureyev speak openly about his gay identity and HIV status.  The owner of the bathhouse he frequented even participated in an interview.

This documentary features men and women equally talking about the Nureyev they knew.  Discrimination against the HIV-positive is only hinted at here.  But one does get to see many people, of all genders and sexualities, supporting Nureyev and not giving a care about his illness, even though he died during tense years of prejudice against PWAs.  This work show people talking about Nureyev and barely shows any clips of the dancer speaking for himself; this may disappoint his hardcore fans.

I wish this film had put Nureyev in context more.  Like Martina Navratolova (sp?), he is an Eastern European who defected.  Did many gays and lesbians do this or only the famous one?  Were other HIV-positive ballet dancers treated well like Nureyev or did his celebrity make him an exception?  This film show Nureyev gaunt, but unlike footage in ""Black Is/Black Ain't"" where one sees Bill T. Jones' lover Arnie dancing and coughing, you never see Nureyev physically struggling here.

Unlike most documentaries, this one actually had foreign language subtitles.  This was helpful at times because many of the interviewees had poor English skills.  This work is not subtitled in Russian, Nureyev's mother tongue.  Because more and more Russians are moving to the United States, that would have been helpful to those viewers and I wish the DVD makers had thought about that.",1113523200,37,2255,4.957333333333334
8033319,4,B0002VGTZM,"Very personal narrative provided by friends of Nureyev, some sincere and some shallow.  A voyage through his European life and to it's end.",1006646400,3,139,5.043478260869565
8033320,4,B0002VGTZM,"In the last ten years of his life, Rudolf Nureyev endeavored to find new directions for his career, as he struggled against the progress of a cruel disease.  This video describes his success and his untimely death, through  interviews with colleagues and friends, and provides some glimpses of  extraordinargy performances by this brilliant and driven artist.  There is  much natural drama here, indeed perhaps to find the stage in the future as  some variation of ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"".  It would make  sense to view this video as a final chapter of his life and work,  complemented by the earlier ""Nureyev"", and at least one  full-length ballet-- such as ""Romeo and Juliet"".  A  ""must"" for all of us who saw him twenty or thirty years ago, and  lost touch when he became artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet.",949881600,23,827,4.821428571428571
