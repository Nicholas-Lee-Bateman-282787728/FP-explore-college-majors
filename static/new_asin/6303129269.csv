7839099,5,6303129269,"James Garner is one of the finest actors in television history. Unlike many actors in long-running series, he gives a fine performance in every episode. The true charm of the series is a combination of his acting ability and the terrific supporting cast and guest stars in addition to great script writing. The episodes are not simply ""action"" stories but frequently deal with the psychology of the various leading characters as well as the social mores of the United States and more specifically Southern California in the 1970's, sometimes seriously, sometimes in a satirical or humorous way, but always interesting.
Why isn't there TV like this any more?",1024012800,14,657,5.092592592592593
7839100,3,6303129269,"This is a clever episode from the show's brilliant first season. Private eye Jim Rockford tries to track down a man who may have faked his death to grab a $400,000 insurance claim. James Garner already seemed completely comfortable in the shoes of Rockford, and there's great support from guest star Jill Clayburgh (who manages to look cute in a '70s-style afro).
For diehard fans of the series, however, there's a rather egregious cut made of a crucial scene that shows how Jim gets out of a scrape. Viewers who haven't seen the missing footage will find themselves wondering what happened. It seems that MCA Home Video used a syndication print, rather than an original master. In sum, then, five stars for the episode and the visual quality of the print -- but two stars must be subtracted from the overall rating given the editing.
""Rockford,"" by the way, is a series that cries out for a comprehensive release in the Columbia House Video Library series.",971568000,23,957,4.771084337349397
