8264462,3,B00170ID4M,"Previous reviews are right on. This is an interesting bit of vintage movie history. Sally Rand is a marginal actress but the rest of the cast is good. The story is predictable. Sally Rand's dancing is provocative, but losses it's authenticity because she has a body stocking on. If an exotic dancer is going to dance, don't change the presentation.",1463961600,,348,4.816666666666666

I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BASED ON A TRUE STORY. OH HOW WE GET DUPED INTO THINGS FROM RUMORS. WHY THIS WAS BANNED IN BOSTON BEATS ME. I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS MOVIE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BANNED IT EXCEPT A RATING OF ONE STAR FOR THE SOUND IN THE MOVIE: IT WAS REALLY BAD; BAD & BAD...",1399334400,2,458,3.683673469387755
8264464,1,B00170ID4M,Made on poverty row after the her fame as a fan dancer at th world fairs this Sally rand film is a huge loser. Sally drifts in and out as thr D.A.'s daughter who is a stripper. When dad is killed Sally takes on the mob by going under cover to work in gangland clubs. Other than two misty dances in one of which she does appear totally nude she adds little to thr films. Not very photogenic and just barely able to deliver the dialogue it is clear why her small film career petered out whith the end of the silent era.,1251158400,7,517,4.029126213592233
8264465,3,B00170ID4M,"THE SUNSET MURDER CASE (1938), the final film appearance of burlesque star Sally Rand, gets it's long-awaited DVD debut thanks to the good folks at Alpha (Oldies).  While it's hardly a masterpiece, this is a brisk little programmer from 'Poverty Row' studio Grand National/PRC.

Sally Rand plays Kathy O'Connor, a nightclub dancer who goes undercover as burlesque artiste ""Valerie"" when her police-chief father (Frank O'Connor) is killed by gangland henchmen.  In the midst of all the action, Rand is showcased performing her world-famous, half-naked fan dance; plus the 'Bubble Routine' (later immortalised in Tex Avery's 1941 animated short ""Hollywood Steps Out"").

Kathryn Kane has a fun supporting role as Kathy's scatterbrained girlfriend, adding lots of comedy (plus the musical number ""I'd Rather Look At You"").  Look out for other 1930's regulars like Lona Andre (""Slaves in Bondage""), Esther Muir (""Stolen Paradise""), and Reed Hadley (""Zorro's Fighting Legion"").

Fans of Sally Rand will, I suspect, be the ones who'll really appreciate this title.  The trailblazing burlesque star's few movies are mostly unavailable on DVD, so this film (where she performs her two landmark routines) is a much-welcome release.  While she never quite got the same recognition as Gypsy Rose Lee, Ms Rand contributed her own unique legacy to the artform which came to be known as burlesque.  Her erotic fan-dance was first performed at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, and resulted in Rand being arrested for ""lewd conduct"".  Because it contained both of Rand's most notorious dances, THE SUNSET MURDER CASE ended up being banned throughout several US states during it's original theatrical release.

A must-own for 1930s film collectors and admirers of Sally Rand.",1214352000,15,1758,5.356363636363636
