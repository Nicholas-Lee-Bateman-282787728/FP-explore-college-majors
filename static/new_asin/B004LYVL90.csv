The characters are well defined, the music is beautiful and intellgent and the cinematography stunning. Well acted and well produced, you should give this film a shot.",1519430400,,268,4.604166666666667
8435328,2,B004LYVL90,"As a movie, I'd say buy the soundtrack. The music is the best thing about it. I gave it 2 stars because the music kept it from 1. The fact is, I simply found it boring. There is almost no dialogue and almost no story whatsoever. It seemed like one of those experimental European films of the 60's that wanted to explore what a movie shouldn't be. There are way too many long held close-ups and zooms. I know it was a cheap student film so I will forgive the zooms. But you really need a story or some characters.
Do buy the soundtrack - though I wish they had the money to rerecord the vocals in a more professional way. It sounds like they have some great music with only fair vocals recorded on location layered on top.",1517788800,,721,4.194244604316546

8435330,5,B004LYVL90,"Love the songs in this film! Damien Chazelle is a rising filmmaker / director / writer. This was his first film - if you are are interested in the film industry and/or a classy movie buff, I would definitely recommend watching this film and following Damien's career. This one's a black and white musical with a French feel - not the typical perfect ending American film, but a more realistic glimpse into the characters' lives with pleasant musical accompaniment.",1420848000,2,464,4.886075949367089
8435331,4,B004LYVL90,"It was unapologetically rough around the edges and at times amateurish, but it had a lot of balls and for that I respected it a great deal.",1393545600,2,139,4.185185185185185
8435332,4,B004LYVL90,"""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" is a delightful and charming film with music, song, and dance.

I really enjoyed it even though it wasn't quite what I expected from the previews I saw. It plays very much like a European film from the 50's or 60's. It also struck me that the film in many ways evokes the spirit and style of jazz music, which plays an integral part in the film. All of this adds up to something that might be a bit strange for people used to the typical American style of narrative storytelling. But I went with it and it worked for me. Moreover, the direction is both raw and adventurous. The actors are very appealing in their portrayals of flawed characters most people probably wouldn't be clamoring to go out on a date with in real life. And the songs become stuck in your head.

Kudos to writer/director Damien Chazelle for having the confidence to make this film in such an off-beat yet assured way. I hope we see another film from him soon, as I'm interested in seeing how his style evolves after this.",1315440000,5,1029,4.382198952879581
8435333,5,B004LYVL90,"Featuring catchy original tunes, inspiring improvised performances, and beautiful camerawork that highlights the well-known and hidden sides of Boston, G&M is a joy to watch -- a whimsical escape from everyday life into a place where breaking out into song is the most natural thing in the world.  Anyone who enjoys musicals, jazz, romance, people, movies, or life should see this film.",1304380800,7,386,5.225806451612903
