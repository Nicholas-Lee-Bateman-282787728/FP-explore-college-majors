5567515,5,B00BAXTY6W,"We came upon this show in Netflix our interest was captured from the first episode.. We thought the actors were fabulous, and the action keeps you on the edge of your seat in every episode.  We can't wait until season five comes out.  These actors are wonderful... We recommend to anyone that likes police/swat team action... excellent

5567516,5,B00BAXTY6W,I am so upset that this show will not continue.  It was a very very good show.  I was absloutely addicted to this show.  Very realistic.  I like the other commentor will be so glad to have it all on dvd.,1361750400,3,203,3.8780487804878048
5567517,5,B00BAXTY6W,I have thoroughly enjoyed Flashpoint! I'd stay up late to watch this show. Excellent actors and writters! I will miss this show alot!! I wish it would continue for another 5 years!,1361664000,,180,4.65625
5567518,5,B00BAXTY6W,"I am so disappointed that they took my show off the air!!!  This has been the best police series I have EVER watched.  It is really sad that they stopped production after only 5 seasons. At least I will have my 5 seasons on DVD to watch over and over. I am sure going to miss watching ""Team One"" every Tuesday night at 11:00P.M. I have really enjoyed watching all of the actors, but I especially loved Hugh Dillon!!!!

GOOD-BYE TEAM ONE- Maybe if enough people write in about how much they like the show, then someone just might listen to us and bring it back for Season 6---Yeah, WISHFUL THINKING.......

5567519,5,B00BAXTY6W,Great show.  Love the how they would give you insight and/or different perspective.  The finale was nicely done. Phenomenal ending with closure. One of the best finales have ever seen. Love watching the reruns with Amazon Prime.,1505347200,,228,5.135135135135135

5567521,5,B00BAXTY6W,"It made me want to move to Toronto. No sex, no foul language, superb acting, fantastic scenes of Toronto. Only from Canada do you get such a great show. Here in USA, with an idiot for President, do we get continued garbage on TV and in the movies. Whoo Ray for Canada. Send more of your TV to us down here in POO POO land.

5567524,5,B00BAXTY6W,"The first season was one where you wondered if this was going to be the typical cop and bad guy shoot out. Believe me, this rates at the top 1% of shows...not just police shows. The producers built in the drama, carried stories through seasons, and showed us the human side of every actor and SRU agent.  Once I got into the people and the drama, the show was more about seeing shelves of special police deal with the drama of life and death, as well as their own tortured souls when it came to shootings.

One of the best series ever made. They ended on a perfect note!....but I will miss the show.",1498176000,3,599,4.245614035087719

5567580,5,B00BAXTY6W,"One of my favorites of all the seasons.  Sad that the show ended after this season, but at least they were able to wrap things up in a reasonable fashion.

After years of either dating secretly or being broken up, Sam and Jules can finally date openly while still being teammates, and get some surprising news just before their wedding.  Raf leaves the team after a bad call and Leah rejoins Team One.  Ed deals with the difficult aftermath of that bad call and the shot he had to take.  Greg's and Ed's sons try to figure out their futures.  Spike has to decide whether or not to keep dancing around dispatcher Winnie or make a move.

So many good episodes.  Glad I got this as part of the series box set a year ago, and am also happy to have it available in Prime Video so I can watch it on the go and with subtitles (which the DVDs lack).",1481241600,2,841,4.180124223602484

5567626,5,B00BAXTY6W,This series is a fast action police drama. What I like is that it doesn't get bogged down in the personal lives of the characters. You learn just enough about the characters to understand them but the series focuses mostly on the action of the day. Events typically happen in just one day. Events don't take days to unfold. There is plenty of action.,1474588800,,350,4.484375

I am not sure how accurate it is to the real special swat type unit of Toronto, but I am thankful for the positive light it portrays the men and Women of the police force. The special bond between teammates, the concern for the lives of citizens above all else. With all of the negative publicity toward law enforcement because of a few bad people it is refreshing to see something that is not painting cops to be a bunch of racist monsters.",1468108800,,561,4.203703703703703

I love the different plots and episodes as they stirred up emotions in me and had me glued to the screen, but the main thing I loved was the character development.

5567756,5,B00BAXTY6W,"It really shows you the emotional side of law enforcement.  It really angers me when I hear people bashing police officers.  I always think back to this show and how police officers basically give up their lives emotionally to protect us.  My three favorite episodes are ""Perfect Storm"" ""Broken Peace"" and Fit For Duty.

In ""Perfect Storm"" (SPOILER ALERT) its based around a school shooting and the real reason they happen.  Kids feel trapped and cant fight back anymore these days without getting into legal trouble, so they just deal with it until they snap.  Very emotional episode.

In ""Broken Peace"" you must watch this episode if nothing else.  You will be left sitting paralyzed on your couch running through alternative solutions to the issue. This show really sucks you in making you feel like you are there.

Fit for Duty is really an episode based on the emotional damage law enforcement and the price their families pay.

Bring Back Flashpoint!

5568021,5,B00BAXTY6W,"One of the best TV shows...that never got worse after four seasons...(yes, I'm looking at you, 24!).

The characters are so colorful, yet so human. The stories are very real and they make you think about ""what would happen if I was in that situation? How would I react?"" It shows that police work, especially the work of this specific department of the Force is not always black and white. You have to be not only a great police man or woman, but also a bit of a psychologists, bit of a maniac and definitely an honest, straight shooter.
...and sometimes a sniper :)

My wife and I have watched all seasons twice already...and in a few months, we'll probably come back to this show once again. It's that enjoyable.",1454198400,,714,4.484615384615385

5568183,4,B00BAXTY6W,"This is a fabulous TV show set in Toronto Canada. Except for the songs at the ends of most of the episodes, I loved everything about this show. (I'm not a fan of songs with lyrics that explain what is happening or what everyone is feeling.) -- the acting, directing, photography and all the other tech work was exceptional. This is a show that is equal to a first-run, first-rate action film. Some of the episodes, over the course of 5 seasons, were a tiny bit lame. But that's niggling (no relation to N-word). The emphasis is on the team and the work that they do. Personal relationships take a back seat. I like this approach. A similar TV show ""CSI Las Vegas"" went somewhat off the rails during its final season with William Peterson. In that 10th year, there was too much emphasis on personality, too little on action. Still, CSI, Las Vegas remains the best of the best for this time of drama. Up until Petersen left the show. Flashpoint is number 2.",1444694400,,955,4.462857142857143
5568184,5,B00BAXTY6W,"One of the best police shows I've watched!  Love that the writers humanized the ""subject"" allowing the SRU to be more effective at diffusing flashpoints.  Also, appreciate that the SRU treats the ""subject"" with dignity... saying ""thank you"" for making the right choices in the situation.  Reminds me that people act out because they are hurting inside and they don't know how to deal with their feelings the right way.  I will most likely re-watch all the seasons.  Highly recommended.",1444435200,,485,5.0125

One experiences the crisis that drove the (villain) to be in their current state (and) subsequently the necessary action taken by the (saviors) to bring about an end with an emotional confrontation. What is exceptional is the humanizing of all those involved. I, at times choked up and yes I cried.  My heart hurt not only for the (victims), but also for the (saviors) and amazingly, at times, I cried for the perpetrators (villains).

5568327,5,B00BAXTY6W,This is a great series to get into. Its not all shooter based all though it has its fair share. I like how they get into personalizing the cases and not so much just the action like all other standard cop shows. The actors do a great job in making you feel like you know them over time and not just as someone reading a script. They touch on many real issues we can be faced with at any point in our lives. I think there are a few that were done on actual happenings but can not be sure if they were intentional or coincidental but they seemed familiar in some way. After watching a few episodes you will become attached to one or several of the characters I am sure. Its a shame they couldn't go on longer as I think it is much better then most longer running police shows that have been done or are still running.,1426896000,3,815,4.068322981366459

Makes you think and brings up moral dilemmas and also things to realize about the complexities and hardships these kind of teams face. Most episodes are individual and can be watched alone (or they will say part 1 of 2), however then you might miss the references to earlier events and the development of the relationships and why they feel/act/react as they do. The best way is to start from the beginning and go sequentially for me.",1426377600,,560,4.554455445544554

5568369,5,B00BAXTY6W,"Excellent Toronto-based series about a S.W.A.T.-like team's tribulations and triumphs. In contrast to similar U.S. programs, the fictional Strategic Response Unit employs a lot of psychology and profiling in an attempt to resolve dangerous situations without harming anyone. [Tag line: ""Respect. Connect. Protect.""] I like this approach instead of always going in with guns blazing. Make no mistake, the SRU members can be deadly when there are no other options, but that is not their first inclination. The last 2 episodes of this (final) season are a tense but satisfying conclusion to the series.

NOTE: I watched the first 4 seasons on the CBS network, which licensed them for U.S. broadcasts, mostly during summers. The 5th season was picked up by the ION network which I do not get. I was happy to see this included with Amazon Prime.",1419984000,,840,5.043165467625899

As for this not being the entire series.. I check on Canadian tv and their season 5 ends with #13. Keep the peace, part 2.

5568421,5,B00BAXTY6W,"Loved this show...too bad it's done. I watched all seasons twice in a row and thinking about doing it again. I loved all the characters, the plots, drama, but most of all the insane action. Loved the individual males in their complex roles, especially Spike, Ed, Greg, Sam...I could go on. And Jules, oh my God Jules is such a REAL person bringing her strength and abilities as a woman to the job. And as a woman in IT work myself; I know how hard it is to have to do everything twice as good as all the males. Jules is so beautiful as a person. I don't understand why people like her don't become huge stars. Great role model for little girls out there or any woman that wants to revisit plans for their professional life. This show makes you believe that there is more to police work than just 8-5 drudge - it's like family - only better. This show is so worth watching for the thrill, the emotional range and such incredible interesting story lines!",1414368000,,952,4.353932584269663

5568436,5,B00BAXTY6W,This show says itself apart from the usual procedural cop shows. It focuses on ongoing crimes and has a wonderfully suspenseful physiological aspect to it. Instead of solving a case post crime it's about dealing with crimes in progress. It's Canadian so even I was hesitant but I hate to say they know what they are doing when it comes to this show.,1412208000,,349,4.555555555555555

5568440,5,B00BAXTY6W,"All 5 seasons of Flashpoint were terrific.  Each episode was as good as or better than the previous.  This show is highly addictive - once you've start watching, you just can't stop.  There are few shows out there that I have watched more than once, I have watched Flashpoint all the way through 3 times now - I'll probably watch again some time.

5568451,5,B00BAXTY6W,"WOW!! By far among the top three cop shows of all time. For those who wish it went for longer, I empathize. But those that are best remembered are those that went in their prime rather than fade away into obscurity. The writing, storylines, continuity, and character development of this series is awesome. I know it's fiction, but the attitudes of the SRU follow pretty close to the real differences of Canadian people, government, and civil workers. I've worked both sides of the border as a trucker for over 2 decades. To Canada I say well done, to America I say this is what we once were. People DO MATTER!! The writers here show us that there are at least two sides to every story. As civilized people it is up to us to practice civility, prudence, and tolerance where feasible and judicious force where there are those who can't exercise those characteristics. A fellow driver pointed out something that has gone missing from many modern American squad cars.. ""To Protect AND Serve"". This used to be on all law enforcement vehicles. Now so many have just turned into revenue generating code enforcers. Remember fellow citizens, it is NOT us verses them, your country or mine. This is OUR country! Government and police work for us! If we can't keep that straight then maybe we do deserve to let by tyranny.",1410393600,2,1311,4.67965367965368

5568454,5,B00BAXTY6W,"I love this show beyond all reason. At first, it just feels like an action-packed cop show, with high tech weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and the occasional car chase. But, then you realize that it's really about the emotional impact that violent work has on good people.

The writing is a little formulaic, and the bad guys are almost universally sympathetic in a way that strains credulity, but those flaw aren't enough to mar this exceptional show. The acting is first-rate, and the show delivers on cerebral, emotional, and visceral levels all at once. Watch and watch again.",1410393600,,578,4.958762886597938

Apparently, there is a mistake in labeling the 5th season DVD.  This should be labeled Season 4 - Part 2.  The episodes  in the final season have yet to be published and need to be published in order to have the complete series.  If you compare the episodes of Flashpoint that were aired against the DVD's Season 1-5, it becomes apparent that the final episodes are not published.  Only the episodes for Season 1-4 are published but labeled Season 1-5.  Hopefully, the final episodes of the series will be published in the near future and labeled in such a way so that a person knows that these are the episodes of the series finale.",1371427200,,791,4.430555555555555

WRONG. This is a CONTINUATION of Season 4. The labeling is all messed up. I went to tv dot com so I could see which episodes are supposed to be in which season. The episodes listed on this disk are all for SEASON FOUR. I went to amazon's UK site & customers there have written and said the ""TRUE"" season 5 will be released later this year as ""The Final Season."" I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the *TRAGIC* mis labeling and confusion.

UPDATE: Went to amazon.ca (canada version) They have the correct fifth season named ""The Final Season"" available for pre-order with a release date of August 27th. Just ordered it.

So, when you buy the DVD it contains the reruns that you have just seen.  This DVD contains really old episodes.  I was really disappointed when I opened the package.

5568571,5,B00BAXTY6W,"Flashpoint has become 1 of my all-time faves over the last year. In that time, I've purchased all of the Season DVD BoXSets. However, as all US fans know, the US DVD Sets are not the actual ""Seasons"", per-say. They're the episodes as aired here in the US. So, the ""5th Season"" DVD Set is actually the last 11 episodes of the 4th Season!
  That being stated, I still am thrilled to own this Set. Most of the episodes that really resonated w/ me are on this ""5th Season"". Episodes like 'Day Game, 'Blue On Blue', 'Cost Of Doing Business', & 'Slow Burn'! I've been really looking forward to owning these episodes on disc, & am excited that they're finally out!
  The DVD Set in & of itself is the same as the previous 4 Seasons ; packaged in the ""tray-stack"" style, which saves space. Great picture, & both Dolby Digital 5.1 & 2.0 Surround. There are 3 discs in this Set.
  I truly hope that the actual Season 5 episodes (which were great) are released eventually. I don't know how they would package them ; they can't call it 'The Sixth Season'. An earlier reviewer stated that they will be put out as ""The Final Season"", which would be a good way to release the last 13 episodes. For now, I'm just thrilled that the remaining Season 4 episodes that I love are finally out on DVD.

5568575,5,B00BAXTY6W,"I agree....Flashpoint was the BEST police drama I've ever watched. In addition to the amazing cast and onscreen relationships that built over the seasons, my favorite thing about the show was that it seemed to show police life as more ""real"" than many other similar shows. It wasn't always a happy ending. Sometimes they ended up having to take the ""scorpio"" shot to save other lives. Sometimes they couldn't control the choices people made.....and that's very parallel to real life. I first came upon an episode of Flashpoint as I was flipping through channels. It was positively RIVETING!  From the first episode I watched, it became a favorite. Yes, I too, couldn't wait for Tuesday nights at 11 pm to see what new episode was on. I now have ALL that were shown on ION saved on my Dish Network system. I can't stand Dish Network and want to get rid of them, but I won't because I don't want to lose my Flashpoint episodes!!! Is that pathetic or what??? When all seasons are finally out and I'm sure I have all of them on DVD, THEN Dish Network has got to go. Until then, I will watch my Flashpoint episodes over and over again, wishing and praying that they could or would bring back this show, all of Team One, for more ""hot calls."" The show dynamics were fabulous, the cast incredible, the story lines original and intriguing.

5568576,5,B00BAXTY6W,I was so happy this was on DVD.  It moved around so much between networks and then days and times and I could not find the new seasons until they'd already started.  I would like it if the DVD's were subtitled but the Canadian versions are not; however they are much better quality than the CBS American version.  The CBS versions are not nearly as good in quality and the order is the way CBS scheduled instead of how they were first aired.  it made a difference is some of the episodes.  Plus the CBS version kept freezing on me.,1364774400,2,531,4.27

Very happy to read the post that said those 11 episodes will be on the Season 5 disc set.  Absolutely my all time favorite TV show.  I am sad to know Season 5 is the end of the show.  I think they could at least carry it on through one more season but then again, why mess with perfection.  You have to admit, though, they ended it on a high note.

5568580,5,B00BAXTY6W,This is by far the BEST show on TV. The fact that it is not going to be on TV anymore is so upsetting.

I just hope that they are releasing the entire season and not just a few episodes like they did with season 4. I don't know if anyone knows this but with season four you only got the first 12 episodes. Episodes 13-24 which aired on ION TV were never released on DVD in the United States. Even if you buy the entire series on DVD from Amazon and B&N you are still only getting 63 out of the 75 episodes. But never fear because I am about to let you in on a little secret that not many Flashpoint fans in America know about. If you want to get the complete Flashpoint seasons on DVD simply go to [...]. This is the official online store for CTV's hit series Flashpoint. The complete sets are Region 1 for the U.S. and Canada and a little on the pricy side but you will get all of the episodes for seasons 1 through 4. Season five has not yet been given a release date in Canada but last year season 4 was released in mid October. I know it's a long ways off but I promise you that it will be totally worth the wait. I am planning on buying the complete series from them because I know that I will be getting EXACTLY what I paid for; all 75 episodes.,1362787200,56,1237,4.012145748987854
