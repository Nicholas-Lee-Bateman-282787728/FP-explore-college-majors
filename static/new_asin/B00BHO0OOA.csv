5621533,3,B00BHO0OOA,"This is a nice average, G-rated movie. It was nice seeing Jimmy and Judith playing characters that were average. Jimmy was not the tough NYPD Blue cop but just an average guy. Judith was not the high power professional but rather an average housewife type. Supporting actors Rhea Perlman and Audrea Lindley were fun.",1395360000,3,316,4.87037037037037
5621534,5,B00BHO0OOA,I WATCHED THIS MOVIE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I COULD HEAR BETTER AND FOUND IT CAPTIVATING. A REAL GOOD MYSTERY AND THE CHASE FOR THE STAMP IS QUITE FUN TO WATCH. THERE IS ALSO SOME ROMANCE IN IT ALSO AND HUMOR TOO. I JUST WANTED IT FOR MY DVD COLLECTION BECAUSE I AM NOT TOTALLY DEAF BUT TRY TO READ LIPS AND JUST FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF. IT WAS WORTH BUYING.,1394582400,3,352,3.971830985915493

5621536,5,B00BHO0OOA,"I recorded this Lefetime movie on VHS YEARS ago, my tape is failing and I've been searching for this movie for a long time hoping to be able to purchase a commercial DVD of it.  Finally....it became available.  I love this movie.  There are a few others I'd like to find to replace the VHS tapes, but have not been able to find.",1380758400,4,328,4.174603174603175
5621537,5,B00BHO0OOA,"This has always been one of my favorite Judith Light TV movies. Judith stars as a pregnant single mother of a 5-year-old son, who is being stalked by a killer, and she has no idea why. It is a very suspenseful, exciting movie. Rhea Perlman (Carla from ""Cheers"") plays Judith's best friend, Audra Lindley (Mrs. Roper from ""Three's Company"") plays Judith's mom, and Jimmy Smits plays a cop who isn't sure whether Judith is making the whole thing up.

I also love that the movie has such an '80's feel to it (it's from 1987). This movie puts me in a good mood whenever I watch it. The dvd is great quality- MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!",1362096000,9,630,4.478260869565218

8568628,5,B00BHO0OOA,"PLOT: A hitman is after 5 year old Sam who has something he wants.

Judith Light is excellent Cathy a pregnant author who hopes her wayward husband will come home. Her 5 year old son SAM is into super hero's. He finds a stamp on sidewalk and attaches it to his hand in fascination. The stamp has secret data on it. a Hitman (MICHAEL PARKS) is now after Sam AND the stamp. Cathy's husband comes home for his clothes and runs into the Hitman who kills him.  Homicide Detective Braden (JIMMY SMITS) investigates and is drawn to Cathy and her son. When the Hitman tries to kidnap Sam at his preschool Cathy and Sam are soon being pursued all over New York. And even to the small town where Cathy and Sam decide to hide out.....is not safe.  This is a very good movie. First labeled ""Stamp of a Killer"" in 1987. Now finally released on DVD as Dangerous Affection. Rhea Perlman is very good as the gal pal of Cathy. I give it 5 STAR for good story and a Hitman who keeps on the trail no matter what.",1488067200,,993,4.21578947368421

8568631,5,B00BHO0OOA,"I really like this movie.  I had it in VHS and finally found the DVD!  Love the storyline.  Dramatic ending.  Nice romance if a little cheesy.  There is a baby-delivery scene, but not explicit.  I think I caught 2 or 3 'hell's or 'damn's in the entire movie.  Good DVD quality, no blips or jumps.",1470700800,3,296,4.2727272727272725
