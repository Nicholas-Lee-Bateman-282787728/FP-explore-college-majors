8277282,5,B000J3EBHG,"I bought this dvd pack for my husband. It has four movies which are

Juan charasqueado

El macho

El sinverguenza

Todo un hombre

The Dvd box is nicely done.  The box where the dvds come in is a four fold book style and on the back of the box, it gives a brief description of what each movie is about. It is al written in spanish.  It is region 1 and played well on my Dvd player. The sound quality sounds better than those VF movies sold on Walmart.  This pack is I guess the ""macho"" movies of Vicente Fernandez.  If you want the comedy ones get the volume 3.",1166227200,12,561,4.027272727272727
