4983557,4,B006CPFRVE,"This is a great show. The wit is incredible. Would I have preferred a complete season? Of course, but seeing as I have no cable, I will take Adventure Time as I can get it. The show has a minimal timeline, so watching the episodes in the order they are released does not seem so important. My kids and I enjoy the show. The episodes are nice and short, which, in my opinion, helps keep the show entertaining. The 15 minute episode format that cartoon network/adult swim uses allows for some really witty, strange and creative work.",1326067200,15,531,4.484536082474227

4983560,1,B006CPFRVE,"I hate to say I told you so but...

Again, Cartoon Network is fleecing you of your hard earned dollars trying to sell Adventure Time fans another useless random selection of episodes. Last time it was under the guise of ""testing the waters"" for season DVD interest. Apparently that was a load of lies.

At this point in time we COULD be buying Season 1 & 2 of this amazing show but instead we only have two random collections.
Many of us hardcore fans are getting a little annoyed at this point. Please Cartoon Network, Frederator Studios & Warner Bros hear our cry of dislike.

I love Adventure time, Why won't you sell me full seasons???

4983565,5,B006CPFRVE,"I love Adventure Time. I'm a middle aged lady who is hooked!  Cartoon Network is starting to listen to fans and release full seasons. I think the next season comes out in October and will feature Marceline on the cover.

This particular DVD contains random episodes from the first few seasons.  I think they loosely tie into one another when you get to the canon part of it.

These collections are there only to give us something to watch in the meantime while waiting on the slow release of seasons I guess.

These collections of random episodes will be useful though in giving first time viewers a taste of what it is all about if they don't want to wait on Cartoon Network to stop dragging its feet and getting the full seasons out.

In my humble opinion this is the best, most original cartoon series on television. But it's not just a kid's cartoon. It's a deeply thought provoking series. It is a coming of age story and it's a mystery with a lot of symbolism and mysticism about it.",1409356800,,989,4.43646408839779

They allow their Adult Swim series to have full season dvd releases, I don't see why the shows aimed at the younger crowd should be any different. All of ""Foster's Home"" was never released (as far as I know) and now you can't find anything beyond season 1 on DVD (for less than $50 if you can even find it).

There's an incredible amount of episodes on this, about 180 minutes, and most of them are really good ones. And my favorite part was when I opened it up and saw what was on the disk face! Can I just say, oh my glob?

So although I totally understand the idea of not wanting the ""selected episodes"" verses a complete full season DVD, I don't see why there are so many negative ratings.

That being said, allow me to address some issues:

1. Yes, I know this is not a season and that I am being fed episodes I will have to buy again now that season one is slated for release.
2. No, this is not ok with me, but I will not say things like ""deal with it"" or ""just stop complaining"" to those that are more upset than I.

Addressed.

I am reviewing the content, not the marketing. I would give CN or Frederator studios a savage spanking if I thought it would help them not be doorknobs with their profiteering, but that would be creepy anyway.

The content (all five stars of it) is some of the best cartooning / character development American television has seen in, well... a long time.

However, I am outraged on how there are now, not one, but five random selections of episodes out on DVD. I will take time out of my day to make sure reviews on all websites that sell these partial seasons will clearly tell people how CN/DW is driven by greed and not to buy these mixed seasons and not to support partial season DVDs. You can put crap in a shiny box and call it a favor, but it is still crap. So many customers demand full seasons ONLY! You may fool the average consumer, but with a little education, my fellow peers will have their eyes opened to CN/DW's deceit of its customers and insatiable greed. What ever happened to producing quality products? What ever happened to companies that didn't try to gouge the customer and fool them into thinking they are getting a good deal? The DVD's cost you way less than a dollar to produce, but yet you want to try and fool the common customer to buy these mixed seasons of wonderful shows. Sadly, taking care of the customer and offering quality products appears to be a thing of the past.

Please don't hack up the dream works dragons of Burke when you put those seasons out on DVD. I will follow the releases and also educate the average customer on your business tactics and lack of general ethics. My voice will be heard, if not by CN/DW, but by the average consumer.

I don't normally complain, but I am sick and tired of large companies scamming and price gouging the loyal fans for the sake of a few extra bucks. America is no longer a producer of quality, now it seems we are a producer of deception and greed. You should be ASHAMED CARTOON NETWORK/DREAMWORKS!",1333497600,,1764,4.5266457680250785

Those that are complaining about it... find something more constructive to do, such as writing Cartoon Network and expressing your unhappiness over the lack of season sets.  Cartoons generally don't sell well as season sets.  Have you seen how most cartoons are actually released?  You usually get around 45 minutes worth of episodes for this price.  This isn't a season set, but it is a very generous set, that has a wide range of episodes.

They slapped this together and released it, sure.  But it's better to have something in hand than nothing at all.  And it's a good value to boot, they aren't charging a king's ransom for it.

4983614,4,B006CPFRVE,"Fearless Finn and jovial Jake are back for more in the second volume of the hit Cartoon Network series ""Adventure Time"".  This DVD is stuffed with 16 episodes randomly spanning all three seasons each one carefully hand-picked by the series creators.  These episodes direct from the seemingly endless Land of Ooo include:

""It Came from the Nightosphere"" (Emmy-nominated episode) - Finn and Jake help their vampire friend Marceline settle a dispute between her and her father, the Lord of Evil.

""Rainy Day Daydream"" - It's raining knives outside so our duo attempt to use their imaginations.  But when Jake goes too far, his imagination literally runs wild.

""The Enchiridion"" - Princess Bubblegum sends the two out on a quest to find an ancient book, but must face a few trials each one worse than the last.

""Slumber Party Panic"" - An experiment to revive dead candy people goes horribly wrong and now candy zombies are on the loose !  And you don't wanna know what happens when normal candy people freak out.

""Prisoners of Love"" - The insidious Ice King has imprisoned a bunch of princesses because he wants to marry one.  Enter Finn and Jake who must come up with a plan to save the day.

""Business Time"" - Some businessmen wash up on a shore and our adventuring companions put them to use.  Maybe too good of use....

""Guardians of Sunshine"" - The two enter a video game world courtesy of Beemo, their little console buddy, and attempt to defeat a huge game boss creature by themselves.

Like the first volume, this volume has another feature called ""Little Did You Know"" which is a character gallery that has some juicy tidbits on some of the characters in the series.

I think this is a nice collection despite the numerous hates who crave a full season set (I kinda feel your pain.), but you know you want this.  Either way, look for all-new episodes on Cartoon Network and even a brand-new comic book series that's worth your time - your ADVENTURE TIME, that is.

4983615,1,B006CPFRVE,"I'm a 29 year old mom of two, and I watch Adventure Time every single time it comes on Cartoon Network.  Now that my kids are into the show, they want to watch it everytime it comes on. My husband got me the ""My Two Favorite People"" DVD and I was eager to find out that another DVD would be out soon.  Much to my shock and irritation, Cartoon Network felt that we didn't NEED all the episodes.

Is it so much to ask for full season releases of this show on DVD?  I don't want a digital file, I'm going to have to clear my DVR space sooner than later and On Demand only offers a couple of shows here and there.  Why is Season One (Volumes 1-3) on DVD in Region 2 countries but not in the US?  I want FULL SEASONS and it's unfair to fans to be shortchanged!

I know the Bigwigs of Cartoon Network are hoping that the popularity of the show will result in sales going through the roof...but not if all we're getting are a handful of random shows!  I hope they pay attention to their fans and these reviews...WE WANT FULL SEASONS!  I'd sooner splurge on all volumes than another DVD full of clips!",1331164800,6,1093,4.117924528301887
4983616,1,B006CPFRVE,"Don't buy it, plain and simple.  Don't give them your money until they come out with season box sets. In conclusion, wait",1331078400,5,121,4.5
4983617,3,B006CPFRVE,"I don't think I could ever give an Adventure Time DVD a one-star rating, only because the show is incredibly good and I would recommend everyone young and old to watch it. The episodes in this collection are amazing as well and incredibly entertaining. This collection is 176 minutes of great episodes.

But, much like my review of the first Adventure Time DVD volume,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Two-Favorite-People/dp/B005775M22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Two Favorite People</a>, it's not the content that brings this volume down - it's the release itself and the presentation.

One concern brought up by several people is the need for Cartoon Network/Warner Bros. to release a full season set. It's been said that these were to test the waters for a full season set but that it had been announced that they will soon be bringing out full seasons available for purchase. This has yet to happen. With both of these DVD volumes combined, I've counted that there are still 48 (Technically 49 since one is a two-part episode) cartoons that still need a DVD release, 14 of which alone are in the first season. Two sets in and half of the first season is still unreleased - it just doesn't sit right with me. There's not even a release date announced for Season One.

Aside from that gripe, the menus and special features are almost identical to the previous volume. They're pictures of title cards that either play the Adventure Time theme song (Complete with sound effects ripped directly from the opening) or the closing song. Why this bothers me is because eventually I get sick of hearing the same two songs since they repeat themselves before and after every episode on the disc, meaning that after watching the entire disc, I've already heard each song 16 times. I would at least like to hear something special - like demo versions of those two songs or maybe songs from the middle of episodes.

The special feature is a duplicate of the first volume's feature as well - simply character factoid sheets, mostly talking about small-part characters, but this time it seems that everyone on the sheets has at least appeared in more than one episode (Unlike the first volume's feature which included Ricardio who has only been in one episode).

The design of the package is also blander than the first volume. The cover seems empty and devoid of originality, where the other set was full of small details and looked like some thought had been put into it. This one is just the same picture of Jake's face that has been used in several CN promos as well as the disc design of the first set, and the rest of it feels copy and pasted into the picture. The title of the disc isn't even represented on the cover (Aside from the spine of the case). The disc is a drawing of Lumpy Space Princess' face, which is cute, but feels kind of phoned in. The insert card is nothing but an advertisement for the previous DVD release (Which is also advertised in a commercial before the disc starts), and the upcoming release of a Regular Show DVD in the same non-sequential format. It all feels cheap and without effort.

The episodes are all hits, except for maybe one - ""The Enchiridion!"". This episode is good, but it's not great, and if we're at the mercy of whatever episodes they're picking and choosing for these releases, than I expect them to all be the best of the best. Also the order feels more out of place than the previous release. With episodes jumping from season two to season one and then season three, the quality of animation changes drastically. You see the cartoon go from being of much higher quality to slinking back down to thicker outlines and less shaded colors with episodes such as ""The Enchiridion!"". Were they at least in air-date order, regardless of missing episodes in the sequence, it would at least feel natural to have the animation change as the disc continued.

I still recommend this set to anyone with kids who love the show. It's a great gift and still a great watch, but for those of us who are a bit older and still fans of the show, it leaves a bit to be desired. Here's to hoping that the full seasons get released SOON.",1330992000,,4204,4.7428180574555405

I.e.'what the flub'. Def a refreshing show and will be a constant supporter while it's still on! Buy the DVD to add to your collection!",1330905600,4,444,4.235294117647059
4983619,2,B006CPFRVE,"This review is being written prior to receiving the product in question.  Why would I do this?

Because I picked up the first DVD release of Adventure Time, and it was, like this one, a mixed bag of random 14-minute shorts, presented in no particular order.

I pre-ordered it anyway, of course, because I like having DVD access to this show, and I'm not prepared to pay $20 for sixteen random shorts.  It seemed far better to pick it up early and pay around $11 (which feels like a much fairer price for the product in question).  I know, it seems stingy, but times are tough and the special features are sorely lacking.

What would I be willing to pay full price for?  Obviously, like so many of my (angrier) fellows, I'm hoping for full-season releases, ideally with some legitimately interesting special features.

Bottom line:  This kind of thing is released so parents can distract their children.  If you are a parent and would like to please your awesome child/make your boring child more awesome, buy this DVD -- but wait for it to go on sale.  The four hour-ish playtime on this DVD really isn't worth the $20 list price (I assume this price was chosen because the playtime is comparable to newly released feature films, but those DVDs generally contain far more in the way of special features) unless your child is a huge fan of the show and overdue for a gift.  Otherwise, unless you are a legitimate die-hard, stay the heck away from this beast.

Frederator/Cartoon Network:  Please give us a full-season release with some legitimately interesting special features.  We will make it worth your time, promise.

EDIT:  The first season of this marvelous show has now been released on DVD.  My copy came in the mail a couple days ago, and I'm working on the review now -- which, unfortunately, means that this sad little collection of random episodes no longer has anything to recommend it, unless you absolutely cannot live without the post-season 1 episodes.  Still, if you're spending money on Adventure Time, get the Season 1 release.",1330905600,,2047,4.731638418079096

So yea, it's a bummer there's no seasons yet but give them time, they said they were planning on releasing seasons this year. So save your money (I'll be picking this up, the price is right) and if you have a DVR record em all. It took me about a few weeks to get the entire series recorded cuz they play it so much.

While I can see the die hard fans wanting a compilation of a whole season, this is a great asset to a collection as well.

We like the show because it is funny. It is something I used to change because after being spoiled by vivid colorful, digitized cartoons I thought that the kids would find it boring. Goddess would tell me to leave it on whenever it was on. She liked it. Eventually when she didn't need help searching through the channels she would select it herself. One day while dusting her room with her a few months ago, I watched with her. It is a funny show. The characters are hysterical and the jokes are so smart that they are shared on two levels. Kids find it funny and adults can laugh too on the jokes that are wittingly over the kids heads.

Kids like it because there are tons of ""fart"" jokes and is really bizarre. There is nothing like this on now. We can't stop singing ""Daddy why'd you eat my fries?"" With knife storms and colorful characters like Lady Unicorn, Princess Bubble Gum and Lumpy, you know you are in for a ride.

4983623,1,B006CPFRVE,"I must say this show is amazing and there is nothing out there like it.  That being said we have two options:

#1 Don't buy this dvd(I agree with everyone that has posted a review here.)...OR... #2 Spend $10 -$15 bucks on a fantastic show in hopes that (a) either FATCAT bigwigs get their money and see that ADVENTURE TIME is a cash cow and keeps it running for as long as possible, or (b) Pendleton Ward and family see at least some of this money and are able to continue to make ADVENTURE TIME for the foreseeable future.

I know this is bittersweet but we have to show our support as a fan base to something that we all love dearly.  But each one of us will have to make that decision on our own as to whether or not it's worth it.  For me, I don't want to wonder if another season might have been released if only we had bought one of those screwy pre-season dvds.

This is my favorite show on TV right now and since everyone can't afford cable, it's nice to be able to share what you find with other animation fans.

What makes this, and ""My Two Favorite People,"" worth owning is the fact that AT is such a wonderful creation, and the simple lessons it teaches: empathy, friendship, forgiveness, and courage are great to have around for kids and adults alike.

I am also not a fan of the iTunes proprietary file type (it can basically only be played in iTunes or on Apple devices,) but this is the only season collection of the series that exists to date, to the best of my knowledge.  Sadly, Amazon video does not yet offer this series within their instant video collection.

Unlike the other cartoons that they are trying to get kids into like Johnny Test this cartoon along with others like Regular Show are gathering a fairly large fan base amongst teens and young adults (the humor in these shows seems to strike a chord with their Adult Swim audience I think). They don't want a bunch of random eps like Nickelodeon tends to package with the Spongebob series dvds (hell even Nick is smart enough to have season packs AS WELL) instead they want a WHOLE SEASON.

4983637,5,B006CPFRVE,"Edit: Well, this is old and out of date. In the time of this review the series has been released to date. So I guess go and buy those. As far as the few other series that were mentioned, still nothing for The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy as well as Dexter's Laboratory. Fosters finally got season 3 released in the states back in 2014. Who knows when the last two seasons will be released. Goof Troop has a Disney Exclusive Volume One with 27 episodes. Still only 51 episodes and one special to go. Finally Rocko's Modern Life has all the episodes out plus a TV movie in the future at the time of this review.  I will leave the rest of the old review as it is as a helpful reminder of the industry.

It's sad to see this DVD getting a bad rep just becasue the fans are upset that they are not getting their boxset of the seasons. People don't understand that cartoons don't sell that well and these DVDs are not marketed towards adults, it's towards the kids. The companies make most their money on toy sales of a cartoon then they do on DVD's. It's one of the reasons why cartoons don't come out on DVDs untill years later. Take Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. The show came out in 2004 and the first season did not even get released on DVD until 2007. They did not do to well in sales but it was a enough to get a second season put on DVD but that didn't do to well and their are only a few copies of them out and they are priced in the eighty dollar range. Season three for the series wasn't even release here state side and there is still no talk of releasing the other three seasons at all.

The list goes on of cartons that will never be released completly or just won't be released at all. The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy only had just one out of the eight seaons released back in 2007 and again no talk of releasing the rest of the series, Dexter's Labortory has 1 and a half of the 4 seaons released on DVD and but in it's case the second half of season two's status is ""TBA"" and this is a series that ended back in 2003. Then there is Rocko's modern life, a show that ended back in 1996 with only four seasons and it took until June 21, 2011 to release the first season. Luckily for Rocko it's getting the next season released Febuary 7, 2012 but the rest of the series is ""TBA"". Then look at poor Goof Troop. Only one DVD released and it only has three episodes and there is no word of another DVD being released.

So to bring my rant to a close, just be glad that they are releasing something, so what it's not a complete season, just be glad you are getting something. Adventure time could be one the the many forgotten cartoons of the past. This DVD shouldn't be getting a bad review just because the small minority of the fan base is getting upset that they are not getting a complete season. With a little knowledge and a little understanding, you'll relize that this is as good as it's going to get in the cartoon world. I have this DVD pre-ordered and can't wait to get it in the mail. The series is great and don't let the low star reviews turn you away from ordering this DVD. It's an amazing series and since I am too cheap to afforad DVR or TeVo and work during the show's air time this is the best way I can get my Adventure Time fix with out having to hope I stumble upon a rerun of an episode or hope that Cartoon Network does a Marathon on my day off.",1326153600,12,3395,4.131618759455371
