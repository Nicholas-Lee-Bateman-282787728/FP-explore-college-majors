7424882,5,B014VB09NG,"Fairy Tail is number 1!  No matter how far I may go, I am always watching!",1445817600,,74,3.625
7424883,4,B014VB09NG,"Rest assured that the dour looking Laxus on the cover of this volume of Fairy Tail doesn't show up too often in the actual episodes.  After a few filler episodes, Volume 18 moves on to yet another crisis related to the Eclipse Project and Princess Hisui naturally blames herself for it.  Immediately after Lucy and Yukino give a party of sorts to the Zodiac spirits for their good service, the spirits go on strike and look a lot different as well as acting different.  A summary:

Aries- Once a meek girl with ram's horns growing out of her head, she becomes loudmouthed and a bit of a punk, while retaining the deep tan she got at the thank you party.  She challenges Juvia in the desert.
Taurus- Once an eager but lecherous Holstein minotaur, he becomes fastiduous and dons an iron mask and suit.  He challenges Elfman.
Gemini- Once a pair of blue sprites, they become a more human boy and girl wearing black cloaks and shapeshifting others instead of themselves.  They challenge Gajeel and Panther Lily.
Cancer- Once a crab/hairdresser hybrid, he grows actual crab claws instead of wielding scissors and becomes openly gay.  He challenges Gray to a dance duel.
Leo- Once a chivalrous ladies man, he grows a longer mane, dons a full suit of armor, and can't stand girls.  He remains the leader of the spirits and challenges Natsu and Happy.
Virgo- Her physical appearance and hairstyle remain the same, but she trades her wrist shackles and maid's outfit for a leather suit and whip and her masochism for sadism.  She challenges Lucy.
Libra- Once a veiled Arabian belly dancer holding a pair of scales, she now has bright green hair and black body tights.  She challenges Yukino to a martial arts duel on a unstable rock platform.
Scorpio- His appearance isn't too different from before but he now is definitely less of a wild man, wears a cloak, and has shed his sandblasting tail.  He challenges Cana to a card duel a la Yu Gi Oh.
Sagittarius- Once an archer wearing a humorous horse costume, he now becomes a muscular, barechested centaur while retaining his formal politeness.  He challenges Erza to a contest of weapons skills.
Capricorn- Once tall and white, he now becomes short and black, sheds the shades, and looks more like a natural goat.  He challenges Levy to a trivia contest with all the usual TV game show trappings.
Aquarius- Once a mean spirited mermaid, she becomes a younger and playful human girl who seems completely oblivious as to how destructive her water jar is.  She challenges Wendy and Carla in an amusement park.
Pisces- Once a mother-son pair of eels, the son becomes a human/fish hybrid like many of such seen on another Shonen Jump series (One Piece) while the mother becomes a shark wearing lipstick and mascara.  They challenge Mirajane underwater.

And an alternate form of Yukino's other superpower spirit, Ophiuchus, also appears but she is not quite as awesome as the brief peek we got of her during the Grand Magic Games.  But the alternate Celestial Spirit King that will appear near the end of Volume 19 is definitely not like anything you've ever seen before and definitely very formidable.

We got Cosplay Gray on the reversible cover of Volume 17.  I hope that Cosplay Erza is on this one.",1445817600,13,3238,4.737967914438503
