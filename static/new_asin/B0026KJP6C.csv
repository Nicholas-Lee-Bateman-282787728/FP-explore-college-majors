3854164,5,B0026KJP6C,"This is a bizarre movie that achieved cult fame. Stream-of-consciousness, like a Bergman film but not good !  Riffs are what make it fun.",1395273600,2,137,4.708333333333333
3854165,5,B0026KJP6C,"Maybe im biased because i love this movie, but the guys are on with this episode. Top notch riffing, excellent movie. I went from chuckling, to loling, to lmao. A Must have for fans of the series.",1389571200,,196,4.324324324324325
3854166,5,B0026KJP6C,"This is the funniest movie made by RiffTrax!  It's been one of my favorite horror movies for years but now I will always watch their version.  This DVD has the option of listening to their comments (I highly recommend this) or turning them off to view the movie as it was released.  This is just too good to not share!  I bought one for my cousin, too.",1386115200,3,352,4.208955223880597
3854167,4,B0026KJP6C,"""Just a warning, do not eye his lemon drink."" ... A cautionary tale about consequences of Drag Racing and Organ Playing gone bad in Utah. Contains spooky stock footage, a rooming house with a relentless pervy guy, a twitchy spinster, a creepy submergible specter and plenty of modest origanist's dresses too. This surreal moody cult film breaks Kevin's spirit and he threatens the hold Bill & Mike hostage until DisembAudio negotiates with the film. As always the former stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000 do a bang up job Riffing this one, I'd recommend anything with their brand especially the downloadable Twilight Saga audio commentaries which may be their funniest work to date.",1376784000,2,686,5.079646017699115
3854168,5,B0026KJP6C,I always look forward to these guys.  A strong replacement for MSTK3. Worth the piddling price and really quite funny.,1367884800,,118,4.9
3854169,5,B0026KJP6C,"While in a car with two friends, some young men drag race with them, drive onto a bridge and the car with the girls gets sent over the side into the river below. A bit later while people are trying to find the submerged car, one of the young women named Mary comes out of the water and can't seem to remember what happened. So after barely any time grieving she decides to take her organ playing ability to Utah where she can make a new life, she shacks up in a house where a creepy, drunk guy across the hall keeps hitting on her, the priest that feels her type of organ playing is evil and Mary herself just looks blank as ever no matter what the scene calls for.

Oh and there's a mysterious, creepy and shut down carnival that Mary seems drawn to for some reason that she doesn't understand, oh by the way Mary also keeps seeing some scary guy in drab make-up that seems to want something from her, but what? This is honestly not a terrible movie, there's some atmosphere to it, sadly the acting is pretty bland but Candace Hilligoss as Mary is on a whole new level of bland and bad.

I did throughly enjoy the Rifftrax crew's take on this flick, they do get off some fantastic lines especially directed at Mary, the constant organ music, Kevin Murphy's password line during the department store sequence was one of the best to me. There is some dead space, which is expected given the lack of dialogue in parts of the film, the riffs do stay at a good pace for the most part. Its not the best riffing they've ever done but its in the top half of the DVD's they released in my opinion. I was laughing more often than I wasn't thats for sure.",1345593600,5,1645,4.235668789808917
3854170,5,B0026KJP6C,"I have watched MST since middle school.  This is as good as it gets, to me.  Minus the host segments and silhouettes, this is the best, the quintessential movie despoiling experience.  Besmirch, impugn, ridicule, making the best of the dregs, no doubt.  The movie is actually almost bearable, which queerly seems to be true of my favorite MST eps.  (Cave Dwellers and Pod People, oh, just happenstancely interspersed by that Gamera, franchise!)  The main character is awash (he!) in pulchritudinous, which always helps.  Just look at Carrie Underwood record sales if you doubt it... and I hear Shania Twain is making a come-back.  You know we always give more credence to the pretty people, when hacks they may be.  Just watch our star's eyebrows with diligence, yes?  If I had been warden of what flicks were picked for the old MST show, this would have featured first season.  (and good thing it didn't because nothing was riper than this!  Untamed Youth, this is your rival)  I've been watching it repeatedly since it arrived, and still laugh at the same jokes!  Sandwich makin's.  The greasy co-boarder.  The creepy cameos by our director, Herk.  I might even fight to contend it contains the single greatest riff in movie-dom.  Okay, so it's minisculey blue.  We know that these... heck I sat through all the Film Crew vids and appreciatively tittered (rue, sad that is, about Rue McClanahan, but felt more fondness for Hollywood After Dark because it probably wasn't fitting for family cable fare) post MST deeds are maybe hit-or-miss, but I am edified at the ambition.  Those other shows were so-so but still worth the money.  When I hear Mike Nelson, in the voice of Tom Waits, commenting on the excessiveness of organ music in this flick, I wet 'em.  That is the abolute best on offer.

Take it, bank it, this is the epitome of riffs.",1276387200,2,1843,4.780952380952381
3854171,5,B0026KJP6C,"Okay, so it's not playing throughout the FULL 78 minutes, but there is just enough organ music in the film to make you want to head down to your local church and chainsaw their organ and drag the organist out into the street and beat them with a stick.  This is one of the better RiffTrax DVDs that I've come across.  Good gags and less dead space (no pun intended) than some of the other RiffTrax out there.",1257724800,2,408,4.217948717948718
3854172,3,B0026KJP6C,"""Carnival of Souls"" is a very low-budget, black and white movie.  The problem with Riffing this movie is that the movie itself has very little dialogue.  The guys had to work harder to fill in that much dead space and often they just didn't say anything.  To be fair, there are a few hilarious comments, but just not enough humorous quips to keep it going.  The movie has some good spooky, original moments.  There are many things that aren't explained.  We never know why the dumb woman keeps going to the Carnival, unless we're to make assumptions of what it's supposed to represent.  The ending is no shock to anyone unless they missed the first 15 minutes.",1257033600,,660,4.589743589743589
3854173,4,B0026KJP6C,"""Carnival of Souls"" is one of my favorite low-budget ""cult classics""...so much so, I even own the Criterion edition.  So I couldn't pass up the chance to get Mike, Kevin, and Bill's take on it.

The movie itself actually looks pretty good in this transfer and can be watched without the commentary.  Add the commentary, of course, for the laughs.  Things start out slow and I'm not terribly impressed, but the jokes get better as they go along, particularly Kevin's running ""Password"" gag in the department store scene.

If you're a fan of Carnival of Souls as well as a fan of MST3K, this one's a must have.",1245801600,10,608,4.592592592592593
8352855,3,B0026KJP6C,great riffs  .. but the back ground  music is very annoying { only got through  half the movie },1521504000,,96,3.9473684210526314
8352856,5,B0026KJP6C,"This could be my favorite Rifftrax on dvd because of the guys' commentary, plus my affinity for the movie itself.",1517270400,,113,4.7
8352857,3,B0026KJP6C,"Not their best. I actually found myself cringing pretty hard during the first 10 minutes of the main feature. Kevin Murphy is usually my favorite riffer, but oh boy. The spider riff was pretty embarrassing.

It got better, but man, it took a lot of willpower to keep the tv on during those first 10 minutes or so.",1515801600,,313,4.396551724137931

8352860,4,B0026KJP6C,"This is an odd one for me. I had never seen CoS before, and while it was obviously low budget, it did a good job of creating a moody atmosphere. The riffs were good, but nothing that had me laughing hard. So I actually enjoyed this for both the movie and the jokes, though some rifftrax DVD releases are better than this.

8352862,4,B0026KJP6C,"A young woman survives a car crash in CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), only to find that the ordinary, sunlit world has gone horribly wrong. The movie isn't about shock effects, but atmosphere; it's the story of a profoundly alienated consciousness fighting a losing battle with reality.

Herk Harvey's first and only feature film is such a strange and interesting work that the RiffTrax commentary -- a solid, but not particularly memorable set of jokes from Mike, Bill, and Kevin -- doesn't really add much. Good thing this disc gives you the option of watching the movie without the riffing, and in a good, clean black-and-white print at that!",1430697600,,639,4.916666666666667
8352863,5,B0026KJP6C,More of the MST3K stuff after it went off the air.  Pretty entertaining.,1406419200,,72,4.538461538461538
8352864,5,B0026KJP6C,"Carnival of Souls is in itself a strange, creepy and over the top film. Probably not the best you will see. However, the Rifftrax guys did an excellent job poking fun of what old time movie goers might have thought of as quality entertainment. In the case of this film, the quality entertainment is the Rifftrax boys!! I watched this with some friends and we all howled with laughter the whole way through-5 stars all the way!",1395964800,,426,4.545454545454546
