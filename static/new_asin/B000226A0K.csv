2055125,5,B000226A0K,"Do you enjoy a good laugh?

Maybe even a belly full of laughs ???

Do you enjoy watching OLD ROMANCE MOVIES ???

Then what are you waiting for ???

Here's a great LOVE STORY, unfolding little by little...

And unfolding with the greatest humor and comedy, too !!

Life doesn't get any funnier than this - the story of four Navy veterans all trying for the attention of one Navy ""WAC"" -- imagine how confusing it must be for her to sort out all the personalities and gimmicks of 4 guys vying for her heart!

Black and white movie -- redigitalized -- like dusting off an old antic relic, and finding TREASURE !!!!

It's worth the effort to purchase the movie -- and then, enjoy with hot buttered popcorn and soft-drink.",1368230400,,717,4.419847328244275
2055126,3,B000226A0K,"Nice plot, a little slow for my taste, but as a classic is Ok!  Include in watchkist for long week ends.",1367020800,,104,3.9523809523809526
2055127,5,B000226A0K,"This movie was a charming little love story. I am a great fan of older movies, and this one probably entered into my top 15. There was wit and a sweetness to it. I definitely recommend",1361232000,,184,4.138888888888889
2055128,1,B000226A0K,"Like the old movies when done well, which this wasn't.  The script was poorly written which brought out the worst in the characters, the direction bad, the back ground music distracting, and the acting was horrible.  Slap stick humor intrudes without reason.  If you try watching this, prepare to endure.",1356825600,,304,5.04
2055129,5,B000226A0K,"The Hollywood treatment of the problems of returning servicemen after World War 2 took many forms - sob stories, psychological dramas, films noirs, even musicals - but this film is unusual, perhaps even unique, in giving them an irreverent screwball slant. The script sparkles with wise-cracking dialogue, and the action proceeds headlong in unpredictable directions. It is the sort of movie that the phrase ""never a dull moment"" was coined for. The two leads did full justice to their parts, but they lacked the star status to impress the critics. If Claudette Colbert and Cary Grant had been cast, or Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart, they could have performed no better, but this film would now be assured of its place in the annals of screwball comedy instead of being neglected and almost forgotten.",1234396800,9,801,4.985074626865671

2055146,4,B000226A0K,"This movie was filmed about the time of or shortly after  World War II when America was very impressed by our men and women who serviced their country.  I think we citizens felt that way because these folks were our folks.  We wanted to do right by them when they came home.  Not all military personnel came home from the wars unscathed in that war (and they don't even today.)  Yet this is a funny movie, just with serious lessons to be observed tucked into the comedy.  I recommend this movie because it is great entertainment and values to be copied today for the betterment of society.

2055147,1,B000226A0K,I thought it would be a nice movie but I was incorrect. It had a silly plot and I just did not enjoy at all. Turned it off,1403049600,,122,3.392857142857143
2055148,4,B000226A0K,"THE ADMIRAL WAS A LADY (1950) is the only film credited as ""presented by Jack M. Warner"" (Jr.).

Here, Edmund O'Brien handles a comedic role well. He's leader of a former WWII squad of ne'er-do-wells who expend more energy avoiding employment that it would take to hold a job. As we soon see. they have a number of creative angles for living on the cheap. The gang's routine radically changes when they meet a charming young lady (Wanda Hendrix) just out of the Navy who hopes to reunite with her boyfriend.

It's a pleasant story with a predictable finale, but getting to that conclusion is where the fun lies.

Rudy Vallee provides the biggest laughs as a jukebox company owner who often suffers back spasms that cause strange gyrations and contortions. Also with Johnny Sands, Steve Brodie, Richard Erdman and Hillary Brooke as Vallee's trouble-making ex-wife.",1402704000,,863,4.897260273972603
2055149,5,B000226A0K,Don't believe I have ever seen this movie before and it could be relevant to modern day GI issues. Very cute movie.,1402531200,,115,4.2727272727272725
2055160,3,B000226A0K,"This movie is o.k. to watch, but certainly wouldn't win any awards.  I'm guessing that it was the ""B"" movie.",1401062400,,108,4.4
2055161,4,B000226A0K,"Light-hearted, funny and pleasant.  Nice to see a young Desi Arnaz.in an early comedy. And the music was pretty good too.",1397606400,,121,4.761904761904762
2055162,3,B000226A0K,"Starts out with an almost heart shape for General Custer's last stand etc, and then with female ensign being harassed by four air veterans in unemployment line who try to tell her she should not be in the veteran line.  Then it turns around when her fiance that she was waiting in town for two weeks for stands her up.  She continues to be harassed by four vets, but for a brief minute of sympathy, it is okay, then it gets irritating again.  I don't think she is an admiral as it says in the description/title, and then a little later they are calling her admiral and I am not sure why.  The vets want to remain unemployed and get blackmailed by a businessman to keep  the ensign/admiral in town for one more day to meet up with her fiance Henry, or they will have to go to work.  So the plot thickens.  Seems to be a comedy.
It gets cuter, funnier, and better past the stereotypes.
And then, oh boy, she is thrilled when Jimmy and the guys buy her nylons.  She breaks out in song while one of them does the make on her.
She edges off her seat wondering where Henry is....
Oh and I think three of the four don't want to marry her, but technicalities I suppose.  Pretty good comedy minus awful stereotypes.",1397088000,,1206,4.254385964912281
2055163,5,B000226A0K,"JUST THE KIND OF MOVIE I WANTED TO WATCH.  Light,  a bit of slapstick,and a big plus for me as Edmond O Brien is one of my favorite actors. I miss those kind of movies that tell a story which feature everyday people involved in humorous situations, and which have satisfactory endings ( especially ones that turn out like I want it to!)",1397088000,,336,4.317460317460317
