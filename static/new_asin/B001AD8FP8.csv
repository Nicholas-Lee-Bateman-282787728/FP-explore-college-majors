8276938,1,B001AD8FP8,"I love old Film Noir flicks. I had heard this one would rock your world. It doesn't. It sux. I could barely pay attention it was so dopey.

If you haven't seen this one(and why not would be my question) try Out Of The Past",1478995200,,222,3.933333333333333

8276940,4,B001AD8FP8,"One of several post-WW II English movies I've recently watched that are just strange.  In this one, the guy's wife is cheating on him, he catches her and decides to punish her by kidnapping her suitor, imprisoning him in a bombed-out building for months preparatory to killing him.  He goes daily to visit his chained victim, brings him food, martinis and reading material.  The other film that jumps to mind is ""The Servant.""  I'm not at all sure what these odd movies suggest about a society trying to cope with destruction on a mass scale twice within fifty years, but it isn't good.  The movies themselves are more unusual and interesting than bad or good.",1448496000,,660,4.7043478260869565
8276941,5,B001AD8FP8,"British film noir-excellent.  No disappointment in the acting or plot.  Yes, it is not entirely believable.  But the actors are excellent including the little dog.  It is great entertainment.
I read where some other reviewers were not pleased with the quality of the film.  Well, the film is over 50 years old, and it probably was not well kept, if archived at all.  I found the quality fine.  There was no distortion of visual or auditory.
This film was originally called ""Obsession"".  So very glad to have it in my collection.  Robert Newton was a fabulous actor.  And it is good to see him playing a part other than the pirate roles I saw as a child...arhhh, me hardees.",1427241600,3,673,4.579831932773109
8276942,4,B001AD8FP8,"Modern movies of this type are so over-the-top it's hard to be objective about an understated movie like THE HIDDEN ROOM, but this is a well crafted, suspenseful piece of work. Script, direction and acting are excellent. It draws you in with an intriguing idea and keeps you on edge until the last minute.",1371859200,2,305,4.666666666666667
8276943,5,B001AD8FP8,Robert Newton leads a superb cast as a cuckolded husband and respected physician in post-war England.  He decides to exact revenge for his many years of pain and humiliation by abducting her boyfriend and making her guess whether he has killed her American lover.  The screenplay is taut and literate.  The direction is suspenseful and artfully claustrophobic.  This is a personal favorite of mine.,1341100800,5,398,5.171875
8276944,4,B001AD8FP8,"Saw this on TCM last night and enjoyed it very much! (Haven't seen it on streaming or DVD, so can't speak to the quality of what you may receive.) Plot: Dr. Clive Riordan's wife Storm (a beautiful but chilly woman) is stepping out on him again, this time with an American man Bill Kronin. Riordan decides he isn't going to take it anymore and threatens Kronin with a gun. Then suddenly Kronin disappears. Did Riordan kill him? What should Storm do? And why did the Riordan family dog Monty suddenly disappear too?

Suddenly Scotland Yard is on the case, and Superintendent Finsbury is hanging around asking questions. I was amused by how much the Columbo character (in the '70s played by Peter Falk) is rooted in Supt. Finsbury! Finsbury even comes back to Riordan's room to ask ""just one more question.""

I found myself fascinated by the plot twists and really involved with the characters. This was a great find thanks to TCM. Recommended for British mystery fans.",1325116800,7,966,4.744047619047619
8276945,1,B001AD8FP8,"this movie is such a poor copy i could not bring myself to watch more that ten minutes. poor sound, poor picture.",1257724800,16,113,4.181818181818182
8276946,4,B001AD8FP8,"The Hidden Room is a good vehicle for Robert Newton.  He plays a doctor, who finds out his wife is having an affair.  He kidnaps the lover and plans to kill him.  I can't comment on the quality of the Sinister Cinema DVD; I purchased the DVD from Incredibly Strange Filmworks.  This print is not restored, and has lots of visual flaws.  Nonetheless, an excellent suspense thriller.",1243987200,19,381,4.626865671641791
