6780624,5,B00P05SOT4,"I am an Emergency Medicine physician of 14 years.  I viewed the movie at a special screening hosted by our local medical school.  I feel this is a really solid piece of film work.  I appreciate that this was produced locally by physicians and the front line providers of care in LA County's ED.  It will be an eye opening experience for those not in the field of emergency medicine and highlights this area of critical importance in our national debate over healthcare.  It does so without passing political judgement, or making a political recomendation, but it shows the situation as it truly is and lets you make your own conclusions.  Well done.",1415750400,16,649,4.699115044247788

6780636,5,B00P05SOT4,"WOW!  I trained at LAC/USC Medical Center School of Nursing, graduating in the 1970's. I worked in the ER for a couple of years & had enough time helping in ""Booth C"" to know exactly what it was all about. I found this movie mesmerizing and accurate, incredibly sad and at the same time so inspiring and happy.  Crazy?!  The staff echoed my thoughts regarding the reason WHY I went into healthcare for a living and WHY now it has come to be ""all about the money"".  God I loved taking care of patients because they needed it!  That staff reflected what we learned in school & mirrored my own reason for being at the County...we NEVER turned people away...NEVER!  Hats off to the staff, every one of them & God bless those patients who endured so much to finally get the help!  I absolutely agreed that the old ER was the ultimate in team work & making it happen. The new ER, the overload of all the paperwork...it all made me sad & very tired. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE and I will recommend it to everyone.",1465603200,3,1004,4.28042328042328

6780641,2,B00P05SOT4,"The first thing that struck me about this documentary was the speech of several of the doctors.  It might be an antiquated expectation, but I still anticipate doctors being able to speak in a grammatically correct manner without, for instance, ending every sentence with you know.  Some interviewees were able to accomplish this, but others not so much.  The second was the cognitive dissonance exhibited by many of the documentary participants.  On the one hand, there are doctors in the film who seem to believe that the proper role of government is to be intimately involved in healthcare decisions and provisioning and on the other hand continually complain about bureaucracy, paperwork, regulations and inefficiencies.  Perhaps an introduction is in order: reaping meet sowing, sowing meet reaping.

The most charitable explanation for why some would characterize this documentary as non-political is that compared to the sledgehammer of typical politicized Hollywood fare this is merely a mallet.  The fact however remains that a noticeable political undercurrent is present.  Despite protestations of ignorance concerning economics and social policy, at least a couple of the doctors interviewed seem to think that ensuring everyone who enters a hospital gets treated in full irrespective of their ability to pay is a moral requirement and sound economic policy to boot.  Of course no data is presented to support these beliefs and contrary points of view are studiously ignored.

The origins of the problem and the specifics of its current contours are also omitted.  Thats not to say that some understanding of the underlying issues isn't hinted at.  Theres the doctor who tells the unhappy story of his undocumented friend who ended up in a persistent vegetative state after a car accident.  Also included is a 58-year-old lawyer who has recently lost her insurance as a result of having her company go bankrupt.  I suspect the latter case isn't included because it is typical, but instead to distract the viewers attention away from the more predictable clientele.

To be sure, many sad cases do exist and the doctors seem sincere in their desire to help those who require medical attention.  Nevertheless, individuals who have spent in most cases a minimum of eight years in college should have come across the idea of opportunity cost and how to apply it.  The economist Thomas Sowell has spent years pointing out that often times (if not all the time) there aren't solutions only trade-offs.  In other words, we may make something a bit better by making something else a bit worse.  We may disagree on the variables involved and the magnitude of effect, but theres always downside and it needs to be both considered and articulated.  I understand that the documentarian is a physician so perhaps his closeness to the situation colors his ability to objectively document the problem.  He may even argue that hes not prescribing only permitting others to describe.  But directorial decisions of who to interview, expostulations to air and the general tenor of the end product are the result of choices he made and I think he should have sought a second opinion.

The bubble dwelling community might find this documentary eye opening, but even those with modest imaginations and a smattering of real world exposure will not be surprised.  If I had to put forth a theory in one, longish sentence it would be: In a country with an ever increasing welfare state, a public hospital in a populous city undergoing rapidly changing demographics dominated by people coming from developing countries whose administration is dominated by left-of-center politicians and political operatives will end up being overtaxed.  A corollary is that the legal, law-abiding and income-earning citizens of that city will also be overtaxed.",1459641600,,3828,5.165316045380875

6780662,5,B00P05SOT4,"When my son was in his early teens, he broke his arm.  Neither my husband nor I had been able to find work for over a year and had no health coverage.  We went to all of our previous doctors offices and care centers, but no one would even look at him because we didn't have insurance.  A sympathetic doctor's office receptionist finally told us to go to the local hospital emergency room because they were required by law to see to our son.  We didn't even know that that law existed!  We went to the E.R. and waited a long time and when we finally got our son in to see the doctor, they told us they had no one on staff that would be able to treat my son's broken arm because the break involved the ""growth plate"".  At that time, we were advised to go to the Emergency room of the hospital featured in this documentary, the L.A. County + USC Medical Center (the old one).  As we approached the building, we were awestruck by the cathedral-like building and once inside the beautiful mosaics, frescos and stonework features everywhere almost distracted us from the reason we were there.  We had a bit of a wait, but it wasn't as bad as depicted in this film.  And once we were in the back with the doctors, it was one of the most caring, attentive, and super competent medical environments I had ever experienced or have experienced since.  Even though we were right by a babbling unstable individual and a young woman handcuffed to a gurney from a ""Correctional Facility"", we were made to feel safe and well-cared for.  They really know their ""stuff"" because the break in my son's arm was more complicated than expected and they did a great job fixing it and his arm continued to grow normally.  God Bless all the staff of the L.A. + USC Medical Center of Los Angeles.",1447459200,3,1769,4.376146788990826
6780663,5,B00P05SOT4,"I am a Paramedic. This is a great documentary because it really focuses on the problems of the overworked and super-saturated emergency medical systems in the US. This is due to a greater and greater number of people relying on the emergency medical system for their primary care. It is eye-opening and sobering, a cry to find a better way to serve the impoverished (and often self-entitled) citizens of our country.

It was a very well thought out documentary and focuses on all of the players in the ED team. I definitely agree that with the new location of County you lost closeness with the patients. I have missed that since moving and am happy they talk about that in the film. It was very captivating and will keep you engaged throughout the film.,1445731200,,427,4.283950617283951
6780669,4,B00P05SOT4,"Code Black  Long Short Factory 2015  Not Rated  DVD edition

No, this is NOT the new TV series called Code Black, although it does have the same setting: possibly Americas busiest Emergency Room, at LA County Hospital in Los Angeles California.

While the TV series is one of those medical-action-dramas like ER, this documentary has medical students, interns and residents in an extremely busy ER describing the successes and the failures of our health care system as they see it first-hand in dramatic contrasts.  Against that somewhat static yet hectic background two other changes occurred as the documentary was made: the Affordable Care Act came into being and the county hospital moved from a longstanding, cramped location to a much newer and more spacious one (a result of seismic retrofitting requirements) which ended up with its own set of unexpected problems.

6780704,3,B00P05SOT4,"This movie was not a bad flick.  It shows the very real struggle of the patients who fall through the cracks of our health care system.  The film focuses almost solely on the doctors who work in the ED, which is fine - but inaccurate to the actual running of a quality Emergency Department.  Also the genuine desire of the docs who are the focus of the film is to help the patients - but they seem all too willing to sacrifice the patient's dignity, privacy and safety in their attempt to ""make the system faster"", and reduce wait times.  There is a scene where one of the docs is discussing a change with the charge nurse who is resisting because they don't have the nurse staffing to make the change happen.  The doc seems to brush aside how having too many patients to one nurse might be a safety risk.  And when they started treating patients in a second waiting room as a group - the concerns about patient privacy and dignity were brushed off as unimportant.  Other reviewers have mentioned this being overtly political, and I disagree.  I think they didn't get political enough -either way.  The film seems to mention the ACA, but doesn't really give it any discussion other than mentioning it.  The intentions of the film maker are good, and the film is good.  But I personally thought the film ""The Waiting Room"" showed a much better ED environment in a safety net hospital.  It showed how all the staff of administrators, docs and nurses work together to take care of the patient's needs - not just the superhero doctor.",1432944000,,1530,4.5236363636363635

CBS.  Please pick this up for series development.  It is stunning....It is edgy....It is ultimately very human in its approach to portraying a health system being pushed to its limits.  This could potentially push the television medical drama genre to the next level since ""ER"".",1429747200,,638,4.861111111111111

6780717,5,B00P05SOT4,"As someone who has waited extraordinary lengths of time to be seen in an ED, and also as someone who deals with HIPAA regulations on a daily basis due to my job... something has to give. It's inspiring to see the Senior Residents come up with a solution to deal with wait times at LA County. My hope is that more hospitals will get their heads out of the regulations books and the bottom line and start dealing with the real crisis of Healthcare -- patients. No matter which side of the political aisle you sit on, you would have to be a complete moron to miss that our Healthcare system is badly broken. Using myself as an example, when my job went away in 2009, I was without insurance and ultimately without healthcare until I finally found another job in 2011. During that time, I had 2 emergencies and the need for monthly doctor visits to address an ongoing health issue. I spent my entire life savings trying to keep on top of the medical costs. This can happen to anyone - rich or poor. And as stated in the film, for people like me, unless you live in an area that still has a County hospital, you're basically screwed. If you DO find a facility that will treat you, be prepared to pay up front before you're even looked at! We need real reform and we need it now. I thank McGarry for bringing this issue to the forefront and hopefully opening some eyes.",1429315200,8,1363,4.328125

6780721,5,B00P05SOT4,"Probably the best documentary I have ever seen. I am in the medical field so I have an idea of how things work in the ER, but I value this documentary because its not a movie that brags about being a doctor, it shows the struggles of what doctors and nurses have to endure every day. Doctors became doctors to help save lives, its the most selfless profession in terms of constant giving. But having to deal with nonsense drama day in and day out from people who only come to the ER to receive pain meds to calm their nerves upsets me. This documentary gives individuals who have never seen the inside of a medical facility working full gear to its max, a chance to place them selves in an er doctors shoes for one day, or exactly 81 minutes.",1427587200,,742,4.2695035460992905

6780736,4,B00P05SOT4,"Ryan McGarry is an interesting guy, with boundless energy. How else to explain his duel interest in practicing medicine and making filmsshooting his first one, a documentary, at the very hospital where he was interning . . . WHILE he was interning?

Now Code Black, the 2014 documentary he made, has inspired CBS to buy the rights in order to make Code Black the TV series, set in the busiest emergency room in the country. According to Variety, The pilot follows the [Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center] ER staff as they confront a broken system to protect their ideals and most importantly, their patients.

Thats mostly what happens in this intense (and sometimes brutal to watch, if you're squeamish) documentary, though the political and bureaucratic elements aren't fully explored. In other words, don't expect a manifesto on the order of Michael Moores Sicko, which, ironically, made it more difficult for people to get permission to film at LA county hospital. Now, filmmakers are escorted through the building while they film, rather than given complete freedom.

Though Obamacare is prominently but briefly featured in a flurry of white-noise newscast clips from both sides, Code Black is a more subtly political film. In an interview segment thats included as a bonus feature, McGarry says the film is mostly aimed at asking the kinds of questions that we need to debate before we move forward, whether its Obamacare or some new form of national health care. What kind of society are we? Do we really care about taking care of our neighbor, for their health care, or not?

McGarry still seems like an idealistic guy, so I don't want to be the one to break it to him that a solid 40-some percent of Americans on the Republican side of the ledger are opposed to having their tax dollars go toward helping someone else. And that runs counter to the priorities of McGarry and his fellow emergency room doctors. Most of my colleagues had no interest in status, he says. They found their value in lifes moments insteadthat is, working long hours for low pay as ER doctors instead of starting their own lucrative general practice or making even more money as a highly paid specialist. He and his fellow ER doctors believe in the philosophy of the LA County hospital: to give medical service to people who need it, whether they can afford it or not.

McGarry acknowledges that Obamacare helped millions more to get health insurance, but he says that no one can fully understand all the rules and implications. The idea of getting more people insured and giving them access to health care is a good one, but federal, state and local regulations force doctors to fill out between 50-60 pages of paperwork just to admit and release a patient. One of the doctors shown on camera says he spent the last 30 minutes giving only 10 minutes of his time to patients and 20 minutes on paperwork. Another admits he thought twice about ordering a test when he knew it would mean pages and pages of additional paperwork. Still another is shown on camera saying that because a mans injury is work-related they have to treat it differently because the majority of work-related injuries end up in litigationwith lawsuits adding to the problem. All of which means that people who got into medicine to help people are spending way too much of their time being bureaucrats and paper-pushers instead. And current laws don't help enough.

Were told that back in 1986 Congress voted to require hospitals to treat patients with life-threatening conditions. But in Code Black we meet a woman who broke her arm and was refused care. It healed improperly on its own, and she turned to LA County hospital for help. What the current health-care system is doing is creating an overflow situation for the hospital. Some days they have 300 people sitting in the ER waiting room, and when the room is bursting at the seams they call it Code Black. It can be depressing, the doctors say, because they're fighting the system every bit as much as they're fighting illness, injury or the clock.

This documentary features doctors Danny Cheng, Andrew Eads, Jamie Eng, Luis Enriquez, Arash Kohanteb, Billy Mallon, Ed Newton, and Dave Pomeranz, in action and talking into the camera about their jobs and about old LA County Hospital and the new hospital whose very design separates doctors and patients. Some of these young MDs are touted as the new breed of ER doctors, with the reminder that ER doctor wasn't really an area of specialization until 30 years ago, and LA County Hospital was a pioneer of emergency room treatment in the 70s. Some of the best footage is of the old LA County Hospital C-Booth, a 20x25 room where all the most serious ER cases were treated by teams of doctors and nurses, one right after the other. It was the kind of meatball surgery that Hawkeye performed in M*A*S*H, and under the same circumstancessince the first case we see is a multiple gunshot victim. The sanitized new building, with all of its privacy requirements mandated by law, actually works against the idea of doctors treating patients. So do mandates limiting the number of patients that can be treated with x amount of nurses.

Obviously, McGarry hopes his film will get people thinking and somehow make a difference. After watching, though, Im not very hopeful. It seems as if the entire U.S. is one big Code Black. And the answer seems simple enough:  let doctors spend their time treating patients and leave the bureaucracy for bureaucrats.

Code Black has a runtime of 81 minutes and is not rated. It would probably merit an R for language and graphic medical footage. There aren't any answers provided in this documentary, which can seem as depressing as some of the doctors Code Black days, but Code Black certainly suggests the current state of American health care. If those voting against universal health care had to wait in the ER for 10-15 hours just to be seen, we can infer, they might feel more empathy.",1425340800,9,5983,4.8
