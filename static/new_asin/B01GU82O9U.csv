7767710,5,B01GU82O9U,"I'm certain that I will be speaking for a lot of people when I say that finally having this classic 80's animated movie released on both Blu-Ray and DVD by Shout! Factory for the 30th Anniversary of this movie is a long time coming, but well worth the wait and a real treat for the fans. The epic final confrontation between Optimus Prime and Megatron is well worth the price of admission. I like Rodimus Prime, but Optimus Prime is the greatest Autobot leader ever! For those of us who are collectors, this movie is the crown jewel of the 80's Transformers just like G.I. Joe: The Movie (1987) is the crown jewel for that franchise. Being a die hard G.I. Joe fan as well, we all know that Shout! released that movie on Blu-Ray and DVD six years ago in 2010. It will be interesting to see if they are planning a 30th Anniversary release of that movie next year in 2017, or will they stick with the release that they've already done which is excellent. Since Shout! has been able to acquire and release all of the other Transformers and G.I. Joe titles, I'm hoping that we can get a proper DVD release of G.I. Joe: Sigma 6 Complete Series. That would be awesome! It would also be interesting to see if Shout! could port over onto this 30th Anniversary release any of the bonus material from the 20th Anniversary Sony 2006 2-disc DVD release. Overall, I can't wait for this highly anticipated release. I bet that the pre-orders alone are going to set a record! In closing, let me leave with these parting words: ""Let this day mark the end of the Cybertronian Wars, Till All Are One!""",1465862400,2,1581,4.436426116838488

7767735,3,B01GU82O9U,"Dear Transformer fans, Which is more important? Enjoying this movie even the way it was made for us in this world by Hasbro, or retaining the major characters that died in this movie?  And anyway, you're all out of luck, because the images of the G1 version characters are not returning to the cartoons. In G.I. Joe on the other hand, all the original Joe characters were retained in the Serpentor episodes & in the DiC series too. So do you think that's fair, or not? You can either enjoy the Transformers G1 cartoon the way it was made for us, or suffer by it like the Beatles fans when the Beatles broke up in 1970. They were hurt too. And don't forget Star Wars fans, J.J. Abrams killed Han Solo & Luke Skywalker in the new Star Wars movies he made. I wouldn't waste my time trying to enjoy an 80's cartoon, or a favorite movie that wouldn't be left alone against the fans. Hasbro is the world's best toy making company, but they're not the best supportive of their cartoons based on their toys. And think about their other cartoons like Super Sunday/Saturday, Robotix, Bigfoot & the Muscle Machines, and especially The Charmkins. And even Air Raiders & Battle Beasts lacked a cartoon series of theirs too.",1523318400,,1210,4.525114155251141

It opens with a bang, as the Decepticons slaughter last Christmas' toys to clear the decks for this year's toys.  Main characters Megatron and Optimus Prime kill each other off in an epic battle and the next generation of toys take center stage.

The 80s pop soundtrack is... mostly tolerable, the animation is quite good, especially for a toy-tie in film.  And the story is certainly daring.  It takes a 20-year leap forward to the distant future of 2005, where the Autobots face final defeat at the hands of the Decepticons.  Not only is Optimus killed, but his replacement is drawn and quartered.  Then to make matters worse the planet-eating Unicron arrives spelling doom for everyone.  Although the surviving good guys eventually win, it's a fairly depressing premise for a kids' film.

Then, look no further than
Transformers: The Movie!

Grab your sons and tissues and relive the moment you experienced true heartbreak and witness your kid live it for the very first time. Have fun bonding with your child as this movie is an excellent icebreaker for opening up the opportunity to explain real life issues like death. As a tip, be sure your kid is already familiar with The Original Series so they are just as emotionally invested as you are before you guys watch the movie. Then, after the little tot is in bed you can discuss with your wife how this film is a necessary doorway to true awesomeness in an age of meh. Reminisce seeing it in theaters way back when and then let the echoes of a theater filled with crying adolescents really bring you back.

This film is animated gold with original songs that are still cooler than anything being released nowadays.

Even Michael Bay looks back at this film and sobs.

7767744,4,B01GU82O9U,"TL;DR: Despite some production issues and lack of character development, Transformers: The Movie is one of the best American animated movies based on a television series of the 1980s.

Transformers was my favorite cartoon franchise growing up. I watched this movie countless times in the '80s, and still appreciate it today. There is a sense of  nostalgia, but the movie still holds up as an entertaining experience, especially for fans of traditional cel animation.

The film kicks off with Unicron, an enormous robotic sphere, devouring an innocent planet, Lithone. The robots are peacefully going about their daily lives when Unicron assaults them. Viewers will note the emotional impact of the devastation on the robots, who scream for others to escape, by individual names. The opening establishes a shift in tone fom the animated television series - this movie is not the kiddie-friendly fare served on Saturday morning - there is more violence and darker emotional content. The opening sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is more serious in nature than the playful television series, which usually closed with a happy ending for the Autobots.

The opening sequence leads into the introduction credits. These are similar to the TV series, but are accompanied by an epic hard rock theme by Lion. Returning to Cybertron, the first act is quickly established by showing Laserbeak spying on the the Autobots, who are making a last-ditch effort to reclaim the Decepticon-controlled planet. Megatron swiftly attacks the ship carrying the Autobots to Earth, similar to the pilot of the television series. This time, viewers are greeted with carnage, as the Decepticons decimate the overmatched Autobots, with visible on-screen violence. Some of the most well-known Autobots from the 1980s are killed during this sequence. Most of the victims are shot through the chest, and Megatron fires his cannon directly onto a battered Autobot's head. The head shot is shown off-screen, but the rest of the rampage is prominent, with dying Autobots strown across the ship, smoke pouring from their chest wounds. There are many character deaths throughout the film, including some of the most beloved transformers from both factions. I recall stories of children crying in theaters during the release.

After this scene, the writers establish the overarching plot, and introduce characters not previously seen in the franchise. The movie focuses on new characters, or rebuilt forms of old ones, many of which are gimmicky and undeveloped. Blur moves and talks fast, Wheelie speaks in limericks, Springer is a stock soldier, and Ultra Magnus is filler as a leader. Some of the most familiar and unique Decepticons get rebuilt into stock characters as well - Scorch, Cyclonus, and the Sweeps are standard villain archetypes. Even Galvatron is a stereotypical ""maniacal villain"", lacking his former charisma. Since many of the new characters are stock, much of the history of the older characters, as well as their uniqe personalities, are lost. This detracts from the emotional component established in the early part of the film. However, not all of the new Transformers are one-dimensional. The banter between Kup and Hot Rod is entertaining, like an experienced mentor developing an overconfident upstart (Kup to Hot Rod: ""arrogant young punk...I'll straighten you out yet""). There is also a hint of romance between Hot Rod and Arcee (the two press close against a mountainside to avoid a stream of laser fire, and Arcee says, ""...you better stay close to me""). These relational dynamics keep the story from becoming stale.  The film is focused on the robots, not humans, although the relationships between Spike, his son, Daniel, and the rest of the Autobots are part of the story.

The second and third acts have some great action - there is an escape from Autobot City, an unjust trial, crash-landing on an unfamiliar planet, a pursuit in space, and the final confrontation with Unicron. There are moments that seem silly in comparison with the dark tone established earlier. There is a scene where Grimlock receives a kiss on the nose in Dinobot form and says, ""me Grimlock no kisser, me Grimlock king"", and the entire concept of the Junkions speech mannerisms is rooted in 1980s pop culture phrases - ""test drive new ladies' model without obligation"" in reference to their spaceship, ""offer expires while you wait, operators are standing by"" when referring to an assault on the alien Autobots, and ""don't look behind door number two, Monty. End-of-the-line my valentine"" before chasing the Autobots. The Junkions explain their way of speaking later in the movie, but viewers will be clueless as to what the Junkions are saying or what it means during the first viewing. This trait made their personalities seem silly and roles unnecessary.

Toward the end of the third act, the action and emotional content builds, and some familiar characters resurface. Bumblebee, Jazz, and Cliffjumper return, Shockwave is shown as a commander on Cybertron, Spike and Daniel have a father-son moment, and one character evolves into a leader due to the Matrix of Leadership's influence. The story resolves itself with a satisfying ending that will please audiences unfazed by the character deaths earlier in the film.

The story starts off great, has some good moments through the middle, and picks up again toward the end, with great action sequences throughout. Some new characters are worthwhile, but many are stock characters within Decpeticon or Autobot factions. Also, the story has some cutesy elements that detract from the serious tone. Despite these criticisms, the movie is entertaining, especially during the first act.

The music on the album features a combination of synthesizer-based score (Vince DiCola), '80s hard rock (NRG, Spectre General), and inspirational pop rock (Stan Bush). There is a silly, one-off by Weird Al Yankovic (Dare To Be Stupid). The centerpiece of the soundtrack is ""The Touch"" by Stan Bush, a heroic anthem that serves as Hot Rod's theme. Fans of the film will likely remember many of the pieces, and be able to recall specifically when each song was integrated into the story. The music fits the film perfectly, including Dare To Be Stupid, since it is played during the Junkion segment.

The soundtrack is a decent stand-alone album. I tried finding the rock songs on TouchTunes and BarLink (digital jukebox apps), and was happy to find The Touch was available. The score is well-done, and I would be interested to hear more of Vince DiCola's work after listening to the Transformers soundtrack.

The sound effects could have been better. Many of the vocal parts are difficult to understand, some of which are critical in advancing the plot or dynamics between characters. It was only after I had access to the script, via fan sites on the Internet, that I was able to fully understand all of the dialogue. Some troublesome areas are Unicron's voice (when conversing with Galvatron the first time), Kup's voice (during the space chase), Wheelie's rhymes, and anything involving the Junkions. The muffled vocals undermine the all-star cast, including Leonard Nimoy and Orson Welles. The errors also detract from the entertainment value since they affect viewers' understanding of the plot.

The animation in the film is based on hand-drawn cels, like most animated films of the era. I found the visuals to be appealing, particularly scenes involving the chrome polish of the Transformers, the rebuilding of the Decepticons outer shells, and anything involving bright hues - laser fire, the scientists' flasks on Lithone, a ship exploding in space, the open Matrix, etc. Galvatron's assassination of a character after returning to Cybertron was particularly well-animated. For the most part, the animation is fluid, and viewers will get a feel for the intensity of the combat and destruction.

There are some errors in animation, especially in the early part of the movie. When the scientists' flasks are shaking, viewers will notice a hand flickering in and out of the frame. Some of Unicron's attacks feel rushed as he approaches the planet, like the pacing was inconsistent. A character explodes on the Junkion planet, and viewers will notice unconvincing laser fire and lack of detail during this sequence, which was a pivotal scene. The visual errors are sloppy but forgivable.

Transformers: The Movie is a solid American cartoon with the production quality of a Japanese anime, despite some audiovisual errors. The visuals are not as striking as Akira, but are much better than the televised cartoon series' of the '80s (G.I.Joe, Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc.). Toei Animation designed Transformers: The Movie, and stepped up the animation of the television series to the next level. There are far fewer animation errors in comparison with the Transformers television series, where Autobots were frequently miscolored, or voices did not match the characters. However, it is not comparable to the Disney films (The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid) or Don Bluth-directed movies (An American Tale, The Land Before Time) of the '80s. Those movies were directed at younger audiences than Transformers, but have more consistent animation, better sound, and more advanced scores and musicals. Overall, Transformers: The Movie is much better than other television-turned-movie films, such as Voltron and G.I. Joe, in terms of production quality and story.

I was a big Transformers fan into my twenties, having seen most of the television series (including the Japanese-exclusive Headmasters), and collected the toys. When I hit my thirties, I decided to move on to other hobbies, but I still feel inspired every once in a while to watch the first part of Transformers: The Movie. It showcases many of my favorite characters, and is a good coda to Season 1 and 2 of the animated series. I would recommend any graphic novel or science fiction fan to see the film, at least once.",1516924800,,10034,5.165538461538461

7767749,3,B01GU82O9U,"So, i too, scrutinized this 30th Anniversary US release of the bluray and compared to the Australian Madman release as well.

Pros:

1) i would say overall, they did a good job of cleaning up scratches and dust,

2) The colors are a pretty decent interpretation. the saturation of laser light is excellent ( eyes, mouth, beams coming from guns, fire, explosions, the matrix, etc )

3) the 5.1 Dolby Digital is excellent, better than the Madman release, but the madman's 2.0 Dolby Stereo mix is better than the US releases.. potato/potatoe... depends on your preference i guess.

Cons:
1) The documentary of the remastering was a complete farce. They said they worked from an original negative, but in fact, you can BLATENTLY tell this was worked from a standard positive film print, where the reals and colors treatments didn't match from reel to reel (5 reels total for TF:TM). They did their best to color correct,because the colors are good, but i think overall, they missed the boat in a major way on a few things. if they had legit started with a climate controlled original negative, this Re-master would have turned out considerably better.

2) The black level of this transfer is WAAAAY off. the blacks are too 'grey', AND this is after i calibrated the TV using the WOW Blurray disc. Compared to the Madman release, it is Inferior in this regard. The Madman's blu-ray release has a superior black level, dialed right in where it needs to be. in order to match the madman's black level, i had to turn the contrast up to nearly 100, and turn the brightness down to 15. normally when the TV is calibrated perfectly, the contract is at 75, and the brightness at about 45

3) sharpness is sort of all over the place on this Transfer. This is not not an error on the film print though, as i can tell upon close scrutiny, that sometimes the film is just out of focus, because the film grain itself blurs at times in certain scenes. the one exception is the Hotrod and Daniel gone fishing scene, where it's obvious a standard positive print was used, NOT the original, or even a working negative print. That scene IS a film print error. WHomever was mastering this, really sped through the autofocus procedure when taking the pictures of each individual frame, and probably didn't wear their glasses when they did it. Compared the Madman release, the Madman release is consistent and superior to the US release in regards to sharpness.

4) complete lack of extras... they re-used old extras from the 20th anniversary DVD, LAME.

5) a few scenes, such as the aforementioned 'Gone Fishing' scene with Hot Rod and daniel, have double imaging/bluring real bad. This is not in the original Rhino DVD release, not is it in the old school FHE VHSrelease, yet another easy tell that the original negative was NOT used to remaster this.",1512518400,2,2828,4.685483870967742

7767753,5,B01GU82O9U,"Amazing movie!! Music thatll make you buy the soundtrack immediately, improved animation and art style from the already great series and scenes which kick you right in the feels.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

Basically, within the first five minutes of this film we are told its the future (2005), introduced to new autobots AND basically everyone else weve grown to know and love throughout seasons one and two of G1 series (save for Bumblebee, Jazz, Perceptor, Blaster and the Dinobots) are killed! Heartbreaking to say the least, though the new cast of bots are just as lovable in my opinion. Megatron takes on Prime in their most intense battle of the series yet, only to have both die. Optimus passes the matrix to Ultra Magnus (one of the new cast) Who later passes it to Hot Rod. Megatron drifts through space clinging to life as he bumps into Unicron who turns him into Galvatron with a new slew of Decepticons to aid him. He (Galvatron) then crashes Starscreams party and kills him to reclaim his spot as leader. So already you can see there is a lot of deaths of characters that have been there from the start to basically make room for a new cast. I will say it works, it was a harsh and very quick way to go about it, but I feel it made it more real and tragic to see the Autobots didn't have time to morn, only keep fighting and the Decepticons didn't care about their dead, just who was in control. All in all I loved it!",1507248000,,1426,4.438931297709924
7767754,5,B01GU82O9U,"When I took my daughter to HASCON, she discovered that there was a pink female autobot known as Arcee. After buying the special edition, she insisted I transform it for (she's seven), which I gradually got better at after the third time.  It also reminded me of the movie, which I had on DVD.  So I decided to have the whole family watch a film I remember fondly, because if my daughter is going to play with Transformers then by golly she was going to see the original movie that shook the Transformers universe to its core!

In retrospect, it's clear adults were unhappy with The Transformers movie merely because it existed.  Back then, it was seen as a blatant marketing stunt, something that is now so common it's not even worth mentioning.  It's also beside the point.  The entire cartoon was a marketing stunt to sell toys, so to suddenly be annoyed that there was movie was a bit disingenuous.  If you can look past that griping, Transformers was so groundbreaking that it will likely never be repeated in a kid's show.  Let me count the ways:

* The human character swore. Of course he did, because the Transformers couldn't, but token human Spike (now all grown up) did because it meant the Transformers movie got a PG rating, and therefore parents couldn't drop off their kids.  They had to watch it along with their tykes, who likely asked for toys afterward -- thus the whining about it being a marketing ploy.  I uh...may have forgotten about this when I showed it to my kids.
* Robots die.  Not ""knocked out"" but straight up DIE with their eyes fading and smoking trailing from their horrified open mouths.  These deaths include much of the main cast (five Autobots alone!) and Optimus Prime himself.  As a kid, I was shocked. This was Optimus we were talking about here!
* Also, Starscream got to be his Starscreamiest by boldly betraying Megatron at his weakest. The Decepticon in-fighting is a huge part of the fun of this movie.
* The most-memorable female Autobot, Arcee! Yes, there were female Autobots introduced earlier, but Arcee (perhaps because she was the only female robot in the entire movie) stands out, as my daughter can attest.
* This movie featured Orson Welles as a giant sentient robo-planet and Leonard Nimoy as the next incarnation of Megatron. It was the last role for Welles before he died, which is kind of awesome since he also narrated the 1938 broadcast of War of the Worlds that caused a national panic when people thought aliens really were invading earth.
* It has the most 80s hair metal soundtrack of any film ever.  Also, Weird Al Yankovic's ""Dare to Be Stupid""!
* Every 80s personality is in the show.  The fast-talking Micro Machines guy (John Moschitta Jr. as Blur)! The Breakfast Club's Judd Nelson (as Hot Rod)! Radio countdown legend Casey Kasem (Bumblebee)!
* It's a blatant Star Wars rip off: planet-destroying mecha-spheres, lightsaber battles (yes, seriously), spaceships journeying to the center of aforementioned mecha-spheres to blow them up, and Arcee's head looks an awful lot like Princess Leia's hair...

The movie is almost non-stop action, interspersed with a series of quotable zingers.  I particularly enjoyed Starscream abandoning Megatron as he pleads, ""I still function!"" and then Megatron's return in Galvatron to interrupt Starscream's coronation.  ""Coronation, Starscream? This is bad comedy."" When Starscream asks if it's really Megatron in disguise (get it, robots in yet another disguise!) Galvatron answers: ""Here's a hint!"" before brutally murdering him.  Starscream would later return as a ghost, because cartoons.

The movie played fast-and-loose with its own rules, introducing some kind of mantle of leadership thing in Optimus he never saw fit to mention in the cartoon series, Autobots we didn't know existed, and entire planets we never heard of before.  It never bothered me, and judging by my kids' reaction, didn't bother them either.

Can you imagine a kids' movie made today in which the long-simmering tension between two antagonists is resolved in 15 minutes, its main protagonist dies, somebody swears, and the whole thing is wraps up like Star Wars?  It'll never happen, and that's what makes this movie such a gem.",1507161600,,4213,4.918079096045198

They chose to kill Optimus prime. 2. It killed all the popular characters. 3. Shockwave never is shown in a fight,just 1 scene,1 line. 4. They made Hot Rod the star. I mean,come on!

7767849,4,B01GU82O9U,"After watching the entire train wreck that Micheal Bay released, I had to rent this to show the family the story that I remember. Even through the cheesy 80's music that doesn't age well, the movie remains strong. I do remember this well from my youth and getting the side-eye from the parents because there were 2 curse words and pretty violent for it's day (cartoon robot violence BTW).

Today I only found one curse word (Spike says, ""shoot"") and the violence was much less shocking than it was in the 80's. There's worse on mainstream TV and popular video games now and I guess times soften or skews what is violent.

I'd love to own this and not rent it every time I'd like to watch it. I have it on VHS, but who has a VHS player that doesn't eat rare cassettes still?

There's a follow up series that works well with this movie that aired on TV as a mini-series (so that Hasbro could sell new toys I can only assume). Several transformers are ended, some changed (like Bumblebee to Goldbug), Optimus is found and brought back to leadership, and this ""disease of hate"" spreads to both the Autobots and Decepticons which is pretty fitting in this polarizing political climate we appear to be in. What's the cure? The Matrix of course! Rent this movie and find that series...there is hope to be found.",1481587200,,1304,4.493670886075949

7767869,3,B01GU82O9U,"Was really hoping this Blu-Ray would be a definitive hard copy media release of the 1986 Transformers: The Movie, but it's kind of a mixed bag.  There are a lot of pros and cons to this release (as opposed to the previous Sony and Rhino releases of the film on DVD), but ultimately it just becomes another piece in a collection of releases of the film that die hard fans will want to pick up, not a replacement.

First, the pros.  The 4k transfer of the film is stunning for 95% of the film.  The fact that the restoration was handled by a crack team that squeezed out the pure essence of the original animation is breathtaking.  I've literally watched this movie over 500 times and I'm seeing detail and crisp line work that I've never manged to see on previous transfers (not even in the theater when I saw it originally.)  Megatron's transformation into Galvatron for instance has always been pretty fuzzy in previous versions and in this version it is beyond crisp. There was also an extreme clean-up of the original negative that was procured removing all dirt and scratches.  Though this is cool for this version, because it was a clean-up of a newly procured negative, it's not a fix of anything that's been in the releases before as this went back to a new negative.

There are also a lot of fun features (including feature commentary, short bits on the cast & characters as well as the restoration), though a lot of this looks like it was ported from the Sony release though I might be mistaken.

As for the Cons, well, I think this film is a perfect example of where too much restoration and cleanup can actually have a negative effect.  The animation is so crisp and clean that at this resolution the film loses a lot of its fluidity and becomes herky and jerky.  It might just be me, but there are a lot of scenes that feel sped up as well.  The timing is just...off.  Again, I've seen this film so many times that it just feels off.

Even though a lot of care was taken to have the most detail possible pulled to the forefront in this release, the color is also not as vibrant or saturation as the last Sony release.  The blacks are murky and grey in most scenes and the overall colors just seem more muted than they should be.

Most importantly for me the sound mix is awful.  Though the dialogue and music is great, the sound effects are almost uniformly muted which makes for a very jarring experience to someone that is super familiar with the sound in the film.

Bottom line, for the hardcore fans this is worth the purchase just to see the crisp visuals, but don't sell your copy of the Sony release because pound for pound it's vastly superior.",1479686400,,2664,4.435318275154004

I compared this version to the Rhino version and the picture here is a bit crisper and the colors are richer.

As for extras, there is a new special (roughly 45 minutes) with interviews from many of the people involved in the movie.  It is well done and interesting.  Some of the other extras seem to be recycled from previous versions.  But overall it's a decent package of extras here.

price of this release,  I would recommend this as a must buy for all true Transformers fans.  The 20th anniversary
release has been out of print for almost the last decade it was around and for there to be an official 30th anniversary
release is awesome!  Don't spend more money on a used copy of the 20th when this new 30th anniversary release has
far better film transfers and contains better color-corrections and has 98% of the same bonus material.

7767909,5,B01GU82O9U,"Transformers: The Movie is one of my all-time favorite films. I remember watching this as a kid with my older brother, who owned an uncensored VHS copy of this. Hearing curse words on a cartoon, however few and tame they were, was a highlight of my youth! But that isn't what makes this film great. For one, the animation is incredible. This film was the source of many advanced animation techniques, many of which are still utilized today, and that is partly why it has held up so well over the past 30 years. Most importantly, what really makes this film great is the caliber of the voice acting. To name a few, you've got Orson Welles, Leonard Nimoy, Peter Cullen, Robert Stack, Eric Idle, Casey Kasem, and Judd Nelson to bring to life many of these incredible larger than life characters.

Now, to speak of this 30th Anniversary Edition, the only thing that really stands out from previous releases of this film is the documentary featuring cast and crew members, but I don't think it adds a whole lot to the package.

7767920,5,B01GU82O9U,"The restoration of this film is magnificent.  The colors are so vibrant it just jumps out of the screen.  I noticed all kinds of details that I didn't before.  Extremely pleasing to the eye to watch.

 The only downside for me were the extras.  If you already on the 25th anniversary edition you've pretty much seen all the extras.  But as for the film itself,  perfectly done looks like it was done Just yesterday not 1986.",1476144000,,424,4.4868421052631575

7767927,5,B01GU82O9U,"Over 100 million years ago, The Cybertronian War continued on Cybertron, fuel and energy resources were depleted as the heroic Autobots struggled against the evil Decepticons to reclaim their homeland. Emerging from a sub-level sewer tunnel, Wheeljack and Bumblebee collected a bundle of energy rods for a one way shuttle craft journey to Earth.

In the year 2005, the treacherous Decepticons conquered Cybertron. But on two secret staging grounds on Cybertron's moons, the valiant Autobots prepared to retake their homeland. From that opening narrative after the opening introduction of Unicron going by a nearby sun, sees Kranixx's home planet and consuming it followed by ""Transformers: The Movie"" title with starring credits, hard to believe it's been 30 years for cast, crew and TF fans when this animated sci-fi gem (one of the last ""hands on"" old school made) blazed movie theater screens during August of 1986. Today, TF fans and I finally get the U.S Remastered 4K Blu Ray release ten years after the 20th Anniversary DVD Edition.",1476057600,,1039,5.184523809523809

8763532,1,B01GU82O9U,"I only saw that line after reviewing the item's description. It should have been all caps or something and placed higher.
So...the codes barely lasted a year if they expired in 2017. And the cover of the bluray didn't match the item.
Awful shopping experience.",1534291200,,260,4.8
