3060364,5,B00114XLUA,"This is a great and worthy companion to the Warner Gangsters Collection Volume 1. However, this collection of films is much more varied than what you found in the first bunch of Warner Gangsters films. It's not so much that we have a pre/post code comparison here of how Warner handled tough guys and gangsters in their films - there were only two precode gangster films in the Gangsters collection. Instead, we have WB's top three tough guys of the 30's - James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Humphrey Bogart - taking the lead in a variety of roles and films that often aren't about guys that are gangster tough, or even cop tough for that matter.

Edward G. Robinson stars in ""Bullets or Ballots"" and ""A Slight Case of Murder"". In the first film, he is the hard-working cop turned out to pasture by a past associate the minute that associate gets a promotion. Now, suddenly past offers for employment by underworld figures in return for big bucks look pretty good. Will Robinson's character turn against the system and department he has worked for his whole career? In ""A Slight Case of Murder"" Robinson ably shows his hand at dark comedy as a gangster who is made legitimate by the end of prohibition. Now he can sell his beer legitimately as a businessman. The only problem is, nobody has the heart to tell him that his beer is awful. To top it all off he takes his family on vacation and finds an unwelcome surprise in his vacation cottage.

James Cagney, Warners' number one gangster picture star of the 30's, shows up in three films. In ""G Men"" he is a lawyer who decides to go to work for the F.B.I. His education was bought and paid for by a local mobster, and thus his new associates are suspicious of him although Cagney's legal career has been on the up-and-up. This is an action-packed film with Cagney as a new G-Man who eventually has his loyalties to his old friends somewhat tested. ""Each Dawn I Die"" has Cagney as a crusading journalist set up on a manslaughter charge and wrongly sent to prison by the corrupt officials he was trying to expose. Month after month passes as he is sure he will be vindicated and released - but nothing happens. Only his convict friend - played by George Raft - who escapes while Cagney is inside, can find the witness that can free him. But will Raft's character bother to keep his promises once he is out? Cagney gives a top-notch performance of a straight guy turned bitter and hopeless as he realizes he may never get out of prison. Cagney's final film in the set, ""City for Conquest"", is a very good film that has little or nothing to do with tough guys and a lot to do with tough breaks and melodrama, all of which Cagney's character gets. He and Ann Sheridan are sweethearts in a tenement district. Ann seeks escape from poverty with her dancing skills, Cagney with his boxing. Unfortunately, Cagney's character runs across a corrupt boxer who rubs a corrosive material into his gloves to temporarily blind Cagney so he can win the match. It works a little too well, as Cagney's blindness is more than temporary. This film is a real tear-jerker that is a favorite of mine.

Finally, Humphrey Bogart headlines a very short ""San Quentin"" at only 70 or so minutes in length. Bogart is a tough-as-nails convict who believes that his special treatment by Pat O'Brien - captain of the yard at San Quentin - may be because he is exchanging Bogart's treatment for his sister's romantic favors, to put it politely. However, Bogart's character has misunderstood the entire situation. The two knew each other and began falling for one another before Bogart's character even went to jail. He decides to escape and give O'Brien the 38-calibre reward he thinks he deserves for dishonoring his sister. Will he come to his senses in time?

Bogart shows up as a supporting player in ""Bullets or Ballots"" in this set and as a supporting player in several films in the Warner Gangsters Collection. It's hard to believe that Humphrey DeForest Bogart - now recognized as the greatest actor of the 20th century - had to spend a decade slumming at Warner Bros. in supporting roles before his talent was finally recognized for what it was in 1941's ""High Sierra"". The rest, of course, is history.

In summary, this really is a great set of films supplemented by Warner's Night at the Movies treatment, commentaries on the films by film historians, and various featurettes on the gangster genre. Highly recommended. The extra features are as follows:

3060365,5,B00114XLUA,"The Warner Gangsters Collection Volume 2 is a renamed version of the Tough Guys set issued in mid-2006 (and which still seems to be on sale).  What follows is my review of the original set, which should apply to this one as well.

A couple years ago, Warner Brothers issued a top-notch set of its classic gangster movies. Included were such all-time greats as Little Caesar, Public Enemy and White Heat. On the heals of that boxed set, a new one was issued: the Tough Guys boxed set. This companion piece to the Gangster set features slightly less well-known movies but is definitely worth watching.

The big difference in the two sets are the roles of its principal players. In the Gangster set, the stars - in particular, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson - were criminals. As the studio got more pressure to stop producing movies in which the heroes were crooks, they merely switched their actors from one side of the law to the other.

In more-or-less chronological order, the first in this six-movie set is G-Men, featuring Cagney as a struggling lawyer who joins the fledgling FBI. This puts him at odds with his friend, a genial crime boss who opts to retire rather than contend with Cagney. Unfortunately, his successors are not so nice, setting up a lot of gunplay. Of the three Cagney movies in this set, this is the weakest, although it is still decent.

Also relatively weak is Bullets or Ballots which features Robinson as a cop who joins the mob after he is fired (an obvious ruse that not even the villains totally buy). Once again, there is a ""good"" mob boss who is Robinson's friend. Humphrey Bogart, in a standard role for him in the 1930s, is a much more evil gangster.

Bogart returns in San Quentin as a small-time crook sent to the title prison. The principal character, however, is Pat O'Brien as a reform-minded Captain of the Yard, who tries to turn Bogart around, partly out of good intentions and partly because he's dating Bogie's sister. Unfortunately, as also shown in Angels with Dirty Faces (in the Gangster set), O'Brien isn't that interesting a character: he's too straight and narrow and this allows Bogart and the other cons to steal the show.

If the first three movies are merely good, the next three are top-notch. A Slight Case of Murder is a comic gangster movie with Robinson as a crime lord gone legitimate after Prohibition ends. He sells the same beer that he sold in the speakeasy days, little realizing that the only reason people bought his stuff was because it was the only drink available. It tastes like swill, however, but before Robinson can do anything about it, he faces financial ruin. Complicating things are some dead bodies, some missing bank loot and his future son-in-law, a law officer. It may be an old movie, but the humor still works well.

Probably the best movie in the set is Each Dawn I Die, with Cagney back as a reporter who is framed for a crime after reporting on corrupt politics. Initially convinced that the truth will set him free quickly, he soon realizes that it's not going to be that easy; as time goes by, he begins to fall apart. George Raft also stars as a fellow con who is wise to the ways of prison.

Finally, there is City for Conquest, which is more of a romance than a crime movie (although there is a little bit of crime). Cagney is a boxer who is strung along by his long-time girlfriend Ann Sheridan. Her ambitions to become a famous dancer will override her love of him, with bad consequences. Among other actors, this movie features Elia Kazan in a rare acting role.

Besides the fact that these movies probably average a high four stars, we get a lot of extras, including commentaries on all the movies and ""Warner Night at the Movies"" for all the films as well: in addition to the movie, you get an old movie trailer, a news reel, a short subject and a cartoon. Add to this a set of mini-documentaries and some miscellaneous shorts (including several blooper reels) and this set easily rates five stars and should be watched by anyone who enjoys crime films.",1199923200,23,4057,4.598893499308437

3060391,5,B00114XLUA,"It is hard to write a review on classics and there are 60 other reviews related to that and the packaging so I offer something else.

I am slowly but surely moving all that I can to an online collection (legal) that is.  Many people have a few movies in the cloud that they have entered via an Ultraviolet Code.  These codes then allow you add certain movies when you buy them new, and then access them on nearly any device to stream or better yet to download to things like IPads and Cellphones or onto laptops while traveling or you can even use the Vudu application and stream ultra-high quality movies from your library on your HDTV either directly or through a Roku or many Bluray players.  It is pretty difficult to find anything produced more than four or five years ago with Ultraviolet codes so for many of us movie buffs it might seem that using these types of applications are not good options.  And, no I am not discussing stealing via torrent or other methods.

But you can actually buy or use you older movies and in many cases they are approved for a disc-to-digital conversion with Vudu.  You don't need to convert the movie, you simply put the disc into the computer and pull up the application (free) and once it registers that you actually have physical possession of the movie it will let you convert it into a cloud copy just like Ultraviolet, for much cheaper than buying a copy from them.  If you are converting 10 movies you can upgrade DVDs to the highest quality (HDX) for $2.50 each.  If you just want the exact same as what you had (DVD quality) it is a dollar (if you convert 10).  The catch is a lot of movies don't qualify or are not eligible for this conversion.  Out of this set I converted the following:

1. Bullets for Ballots (converted to HDX)
2. City for Conquest (converted to HDX)
3. San Quentin (converted to HDX)
4. A Slight Case of Murder (converted to DVD quality)

The final two: Each Dawn I Die and GMen were not recognized so they could not be converted.  There is an option to take to Wal-Mart and they will convert for you, but that price is doubled so they would be either $2.00 each for DVD conversions for $5.00 each for HDX conversions which is getting pretty pricy for these older movies.  As for the first four, I was able to add them to my online library for $8.50 total.  I know many may bristle at what they see as paying twice for the same movies, but for me, three of these are not even available in Bluray anyway so you are getting better than the physical copy and you have access anywhere which makes it a no brainer for me.  But it depends on how often you watch older movies and if the convenience is worth it.  My plan after I convert, is usually to make my digital copies and then I take my originals to donations.  You can either get a tax write off or if you just want to make someone's day take it a retirement home and see some eyes light up at the thought of Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson.",1446595200,,2968,4.305755395683454

Each DVD contains supplemental material connected with the film title including a related documentary and the always popular WARNER NIGHT AT THE MOVIES.  It's amazing how close some of the cartoons come to the features themselves.  I'm thinking of ""Porky's Double Trouble"" which is included on the San Quentin DVD.

3060443,4,B00114XLUA,"This second in the series of Warner Brothers ""Gangsters Collection"",is a much weaker offering of films than the first one;one is only slightly connected to anything to do with gangsters and another is not an original print but a later re-release copy. Let's look at the roster.
""City for Conquest"",released Sept/41,is the best of the bunch and rates four stars. The movie starts by showing us the three main protaganists as children(a common tool);Danny(later Cagney)who's good in a fight and protective of dance-loving Peggy(later Sheridan)and Danny's brother Eddie(later Arthur Kennedy)whose passion is music. We switch to them a few years into the future and Danny is a happy go lucky guy who could go far as a boxer if he had the ambition to do so but is quite content to be a regular guy and marry Peggy. Peggy on the other hand longs to be a dancer quite badly,while Danny's brother Eddie has the talent to be a compser/musician but can't get a break. Peggy gets her break at dancing but gets involved with a self centered no-good partner Murray(Anthony Quinn).Thinking that he should follow Peggy's example Danny agrees to box full time. In the end both Peggy and Danny's ambitions are for naught but find out contentment was always with just each other. Eddie gets the break he's always dreamed of and thanks his brother publicly when it finally comes.
Cagney's character here is instantly likable and there is a real chemistry between the three main characters. The only fly in the ointment is the periodic appearance of an ""oldtimer""(Frank Craven).He's supposed to be a kind of narrator/everyman but he is more intrusive than anything and detracts from the overall flow. The only ""gangster"" tie-in here is an old friend who comes into Danny's life(Googi,played by Elia Kazan)who was poor at the start but is now well heeled and who eventually gets killed. A gangster movie per se'? No.
""A Slight Case of Murder"",released in Feb/38(2 1/2 stars)is a disapppointing screw ball comedy that I thought should have been better than it was. It concerns the story of one Remy Marco(Edward G Robinson)who  ran a beer ""consortium"" during prohibition but now goes legit since the Volstead Act was repealed. He has a real gang of misfits helping him run his beer empire which instead of going great guns is slowly bankrupting him. Bankers are hounding his every footstep and are on the verge of foreclosing on his debts when a windfall of money turns up at his Sarasota Springs home. Five local bandits have stolen the takings for all the local bookies and hidden in his house before his arrival. When Remy arrives with his family there is only one greedy bandit alive who tries to get out with the dough but can't. In the end the money is used to pay off his debts.
The movie tries to be funny but falls flat more often than not. A moment where Remy and his guys are standing around discussing on who's properties they should each place a body doesn't pack the comedic punch it should. Furthermore,the fact that Remy's business is not doing well is because the beer stinks but not one of his men tell him until he finds out himself late in the film;a very unlikely premise and major flaw. However,one scene with an adopted young teen,Douglas(Bobby Jordan of the Dead End Kids),is beautiful. Remy's wife asks why the ""prize(Douglas)hasn't gone to b-e-d?"".Douglas replies""cause I want more to e-a-t,ya c-o-w!"".
""Bullets or Ballots"",released June/36(3 1/2-4 stars),stars Edward G. as Johnny Blake,a tough street smart cop. Johnny's career is sailing along until one day he gets fired by the chief of police,after a departmental shake up. Johnny takes an offer of employment from mob boss Kruger(Barton Maclaine)who enlists him to check out all his operations. Bugs Fenner(Bogart),one of Krugers head men,doesn't like or trust Blake,and with good reason. Unbeknownst to the gang,Blake was fired as a ruse,to infiltrate the gang and break it up. In the end,and with alot of gun shots and blood,Johnny accomplishes the impossible...with his life.
The story is an involving one with Bogie as a mean-as-nails hood and Robinson doing a fine job as a tough cop.
""Each Dawn I Die"",released July/39(3 1/2 -4 stars),stars Cagney as Frank Ross,a crusading newpaperman. Ross is incarcerated in the pen for murdering three people in a car accident while drunk;a total frame up by the local mob boss. Inside he meets a tough mobster by the name of Stacey(Raft).Ross saves Rafts' hide and even goes so far as to do months in the hole on a ruse so Stacy can escape and find out who,and get proof of,Ross's innocence. During the fiery conclusion a confession is made by a fellow inmate(thanks to Stacy)and Ross gets his freedom.
Cagney turns in another powerful performance with a great range of emotions,especially during his incarceration. He is well supported by Raft,Jane Bryan,George Bancroft,Maxie Rosenbloom,and many others.
""San Quentin"",released Aug/37(2 1/2-3 stars),concerns the story of one Steve Jamieson(Pat O'Brien)who gets the job of head yard officer within San Quentin pen. Steve is former Army,and is hired to enact much needed discipline amongst the inmates. He falls for a local singer May(Ann Sheridan),whose brother Joe(Bogie)gets shipped off to San Quentin where he meets up with Steve;and it's not love at first or second sight. Slowly  Steve's actions amongst the men,especially Joe,earn him respect. But Joe gets his head turned back and breaks out with a couple of other cons. Steve heads to Mays apartment and is shot by Joe,who is in turn shot fatally by the cops waiting outside. Joe gets away to die on the steps of San Quentin telling the attending guards Steve was right all along.
""San Quentin"" is a good effort that could have been better. Bogie steals the show here while O'Brien almost sleep walks through and even Sheridan can't wake him up.
""G-Men"",originally released in May/35,is the 1949 re-release version here(a cheat by Warners-3 stars).The film opens up with a /49 FBI man talking to subbordinates in a room with a projector and screen about the film that first mentioned the term ""G-man"".We see the projector screen light up with the Warners logo and the picture zooms in to commence the movie. The story concerns one Brick Davis(Cagney)who plays a lawyer whose fortunes aren't all that well. When a friend gets bumped off by the local mob he joins the government investigation agency(the future FBI).He vows to get revenge on them;a group run by the boss Collins(Barton MacLaine).Brick falls for his group boss Jeffs'(Robert""King Kong"" Armstrong"") sister Kay(Margaret Lindsay),much to Jeff's chagrin. They begin at odds but Brick and Jeff become close friends in the end. Collins ends up kidnapping Kay and it is Brick and company to the rescue.
A pretty good early Cagney effort with a good supporting cast. Watch for Lloyd Nolan in his first role. Would have rated it higher if this had been an original print.
Technically these films do show their ages but generally speaking they are crisp transfers and the contrast is very good. What gets this solid four star rating are the extras. You will find many delightful surprises here with many period shorts,an early Vitaphone short with Bob Hope,vintage cartoons,vintage newsreel clips,multi Warner stars in blooper(or ""breakdowns"")reels for almost every year from /35-/40,multiple featurettes,commentaries and theatrical trailers.
In conclusion though the films here are not on a par with their predecessors in Volume#1,there are still alot of things to delight and discover not only in the films but more so in the extras. I wouldn't rate ""City for Conquest"" as a gangster film(but it's the best of the bunch!) and ""G-Men"" was a re-release print. But I still recommend it for all film buffs.",1248048000,4,7771,4.9861325115562405

If you are a Cagney fan then you should try this, for the sake of adding value to your Jimmy collection.

Remember that if you buy each of these movies separately the cost will be considerably consistent and you might try this collection as it offers the same movies and special features.",1245974400,,549,4.591836734693878
3060445,4,B00114XLUA,"I will make this short. Bullets or Ballots gets a 7 out of 10, Each Dawn I Die gets a 6 along with G Men and A Slight Case of Murder. San Quentin was good except the ending was the down fall. I only give it a 4, a one time watching flick. However, City for Conquest gets no less than a 10. This movie alone is worth the pack, with Ann Sheridan and Cagney as the big names. It plays kind of like a Roman play with a homeless man playing a narrator that is in the scene. Cagney will leave speechless, and I who don't get choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Shindler list get that feeling with this. Not that its sadder, but its understable and pure. Its slow at times, but it holds together well. This is the movie I thought the least of when I bought and the one I loved the most. Oh, and my girlfriend also fell in love with this movie, which made me beleive this is one of the most under rated films of all time.",1242345600,,917,3.935483870967742
3294861,5,B00114XLUA,"This is a great and worthy companion to the Warner Gangsters Collection Volume 1. However, this collection of films is much more varied than what you found in the first bunch of Warner Gangsters films. It's not so much that we have a pre/post code comparison here of how Warner handled tough guys and gangsters in their films - there were only two precode gangster films in the Gangsters collection. Instead, we have WB's top three tough guys of the 30's - James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Humphrey Bogart - taking the lead in a variety of roles and films that often aren't about guys that are gangster tough, or even cop tough for that matter.

Edward G. Robinson stars in ""Bullets or Ballots"" and ""A Slight Case of Murder"". In the first film, he is the hard-working cop turned out to pasture by a past associate the minute that associate gets a promotion. Now, suddenly past offers for employment by underworld figures in return for big bucks look pretty good. Will Robinson's character turn against the system and department he has worked for his whole career? In ""A Slight Case of Murder"" Robinson ably shows his hand at dark comedy as a gangster who is made legitimate by the end of prohibition. Now he can sell his beer legitimately as a businessman. The only problem is, nobody has the heart to tell him that his beer is awful. To top it all off he takes his family on vacation and finds an unwelcome surprise in his vacation cottage.

James Cagney, Warners' number one gangster picture star of the 30's, shows up in three films. In ""G Men"" he is a lawyer who decides to go to work for the F.B.I. His education was bought and paid for by a local mobster, and thus his new associates are suspicious of him although Cagney's legal career has been on the up-and-up. This is an action-packed film with Cagney as a new G-Man who eventually has his loyalties to his old friends somewhat tested. ""Each Dawn I Die"" has Cagney as a crusading journalist set up on a manslaughter charge and wrongly sent to prison by the corrupt officials he was trying to expose. Month after month passes as he is sure he will be vindicated and released - but nothing happens. Only his convict friend - played by George Raft - who escapes while Cagney is inside, can find the witness that can free him. But will Raft's character bother to keep his promises once he is out? Cagney gives a top-notch performance of a straight guy turned bitter and hopeless as he realizes he may never get out of prison. Cagney's final film in the set, ""City for Conquest"", is a very good film that has little or nothing to do with tough guys and a lot to do with tough breaks and melodrama, all of which Cagney's character gets. He and Ann Sheridan are sweethearts in a tenement district. Ann seeks escape from poverty with her dancing skills, Cagney with his boxing. Unfortunately, Cagney's character runs across a corrupt boxer who rubs a corrosive material into his gloves to temporarily blind Cagney so he can win the match. It works a little too well, as Cagney's blindness is more than temporary. This film is a real tear-jerker that is a favorite of mine.

Finally, Humphrey Bogart headlines a very short ""San Quentin"" at only 70 or so minutes in length. Bogart is a tough-as-nails convict who believes that his special treatment by Pat O'Brien - captain of the yard at San Quentin - may be because he is exchanging Bogart's treatment for his sister's romantic favors, to put it politely. However, Bogart's character has misunderstood the entire situation. The two knew each other and began falling for one another before Bogart's character even went to jail. He decides to escape and give O'Brien the 38-calibre reward he thinks he deserves for dishonoring his sister. Will he come to his senses in time?

Bogart shows up as a supporting player in ""Bullets or Ballots"" in this set and as a supporting player in several films in the Warner Gangsters Collection. It's hard to believe that Humphrey DeForest Bogart - now recognized as the greatest actor of the 20th century - had to spend a decade slumming at Warner Bros. in supporting roles before his talent was finally recognized for what it was in 1941's ""High Sierra"". The rest, of course, is history.

In summary, this really is a great set of films supplemented by Warner's Night at the Movies treatment, commentaries on the films by film historians, and various featurettes on the gangster genre. Highly recommended. The extra features are as follows:

3294862,5,B00114XLUA,"The Warner Gangsters Collection Volume 2 is a renamed version of the Tough Guys set issued in mid-2006 (and which still seems to be on sale).  What follows is my review of the original set, which should apply to this one as well.

A couple years ago, Warner Brothers issued a top-notch set of its classic gangster movies. Included were such all-time greats as Little Caesar, Public Enemy and White Heat. On the heals of that boxed set, a new one was issued: the Tough Guys boxed set. This companion piece to the Gangster set features slightly less well-known movies but is definitely worth watching.

The big difference in the two sets are the roles of its principal players. In the Gangster set, the stars - in particular, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson - were criminals. As the studio got more pressure to stop producing movies in which the heroes were crooks, they merely switched their actors from one side of the law to the other.

In more-or-less chronological order, the first in this six-movie set is G-Men, featuring Cagney as a struggling lawyer who joins the fledgling FBI. This puts him at odds with his friend, a genial crime boss who opts to retire rather than contend with Cagney. Unfortunately, his successors are not so nice, setting up a lot of gunplay. Of the three Cagney movies in this set, this is the weakest, although it is still decent.

Also relatively weak is Bullets or Ballots which features Robinson as a cop who joins the mob after he is fired (an obvious ruse that not even the villains totally buy). Once again, there is a ""good"" mob boss who is Robinson's friend. Humphrey Bogart, in a standard role for him in the 1930s, is a much more evil gangster.

Bogart returns in San Quentin as a small-time crook sent to the title prison. The principal character, however, is Pat O'Brien as a reform-minded Captain of the Yard, who tries to turn Bogart around, partly out of good intentions and partly because he's dating Bogie's sister. Unfortunately, as also shown in Angels with Dirty Faces (in the Gangster set), O'Brien isn't that interesting a character: he's too straight and narrow and this allows Bogart and the other cons to steal the show.

If the first three movies are merely good, the next three are top-notch. A Slight Case of Murder is a comic gangster movie with Robinson as a crime lord gone legitimate after Prohibition ends. He sells the same beer that he sold in the speakeasy days, little realizing that the only reason people bought his stuff was because it was the only drink available. It tastes like swill, however, but before Robinson can do anything about it, he faces financial ruin. Complicating things are some dead bodies, some missing bank loot and his future son-in-law, a law officer. It may be an old movie, but the humor still works well.

Probably the best movie in the set is Each Dawn I Die, with Cagney back as a reporter who is framed for a crime after reporting on corrupt politics. Initially convinced that the truth will set him free quickly, he soon realizes that it's not going to be that easy; as time goes by, he begins to fall apart. George Raft also stars as a fellow con who is wise to the ways of prison.

Finally, there is City for Conquest, which is more of a romance than a crime movie (although there is a little bit of crime). Cagney is a boxer who is strung along by his long-time girlfriend Ann Sheridan. Her ambitions to become a famous dancer will override her love of him, with bad consequences. Among other actors, this movie features Elia Kazan in a rare acting role.

Besides the fact that these movies probably average a high four stars, we get a lot of extras, including commentaries on all the movies and ""Warner Night at the Movies"" for all the films as well: in addition to the movie, you get an old movie trailer, a news reel, a short subject and a cartoon. Add to this a set of mini-documentaries and some miscellaneous shorts (including several blooper reels) and this set easily rates five stars and should be watched by anyone who enjoys crime films.",1199923200,23,4057,4.598893499308437

3294888,5,B00114XLUA,"It is hard to write a review on classics and there are 60 other reviews related to that and the packaging so I offer something else.

I am slowly but surely moving all that I can to an online collection (legal) that is.  Many people have a few movies in the cloud that they have entered via an Ultraviolet Code.  These codes then allow you add certain movies when you buy them new, and then access them on nearly any device to stream or better yet to download to things like IPads and Cellphones or onto laptops while traveling or you can even use the Vudu application and stream ultra-high quality movies from your library on your HDTV either directly or through a Roku or many Bluray players.  It is pretty difficult to find anything produced more than four or five years ago with Ultraviolet codes so for many of us movie buffs it might seem that using these types of applications are not good options.  And, no I am not discussing stealing via torrent or other methods.

But you can actually buy or use you older movies and in many cases they are approved for a disc-to-digital conversion with Vudu.  You don't need to convert the movie, you simply put the disc into the computer and pull up the application (free) and once it registers that you actually have physical possession of the movie it will let you convert it into a cloud copy just like Ultraviolet, for much cheaper than buying a copy from them.  If you are converting 10 movies you can upgrade DVDs to the highest quality (HDX) for $2.50 each.  If you just want the exact same as what you had (DVD quality) it is a dollar (if you convert 10).  The catch is a lot of movies don't qualify or are not eligible for this conversion.  Out of this set I converted the following:

1. Bullets for Ballots (converted to HDX)
2. City for Conquest (converted to HDX)
3. San Quentin (converted to HDX)
4. A Slight Case of Murder (converted to DVD quality)

The final two: Each Dawn I Die and GMen were not recognized so they could not be converted.  There is an option to take to Wal-Mart and they will convert for you, but that price is doubled so they would be either $2.00 each for DVD conversions for $5.00 each for HDX conversions which is getting pretty pricy for these older movies.  As for the first four, I was able to add them to my online library for $8.50 total.  I know many may bristle at what they see as paying twice for the same movies, but for me, three of these are not even available in Bluray anyway so you are getting better than the physical copy and you have access anywhere which makes it a no brainer for me.  But it depends on how often you watch older movies and if the convenience is worth it.  My plan after I convert, is usually to make my digital copies and then I take my originals to donations.  You can either get a tax write off or if you just want to make someone's day take it a retirement home and see some eyes light up at the thought of Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson.",1446595200,,2968,4.305755395683454

3294940,4,B00114XLUA,"This second in the series of Warner Brothers ""Gangsters Collection"",is a much weaker offering of films than the first one;one is only slightly connected to anything to do with gangsters and another is not an original print but a later re-release copy. Let's look at the roster.
""City for Conquest"",released Sept/41,is the best of the bunch and rates four stars. The movie starts by showing us the three main protaganists as children(a common tool);Danny(later Cagney)who's good in a fight and protective of dance-loving Peggy(later Sheridan)and Danny's brother Eddie(later Arthur Kennedy)whose passion is music. We switch to them a few years into the future and Danny is a happy go lucky guy who could go far as a boxer if he had the ambition to do so but is quite content to be a regular guy and marry Peggy. Peggy on the other hand longs to be a dancer quite badly,while Danny's brother Eddie has the talent to be a compser/musician but can't get a break. Peggy gets her break at dancing but gets involved with a self centered no-good partner Murray(Anthony Quinn).Thinking that he should follow Peggy's example Danny agrees to box full time. In the end both Peggy and Danny's ambitions are for naught but find out contentment was always with just each other. Eddie gets the break he's always dreamed of and thanks his brother publicly when it finally comes.
Cagney's character here is instantly likable and there is a real chemistry between the three main characters. The only fly in the ointment is the periodic appearance of an ""oldtimer""(Frank Craven).He's supposed to be a kind of narrator/everyman but he is more intrusive than anything and detracts from the overall flow. The only ""gangster"" tie-in here is an old friend who comes into Danny's life(Googi,played by Elia Kazan)who was poor at the start but is now well heeled and who eventually gets killed. A gangster movie per se'? No.
""A Slight Case of Murder"",released in Feb/38(2 1/2 stars)is a disapppointing screw ball comedy that I thought should have been better than it was. It concerns the story of one Remy Marco(Edward G Robinson)who  ran a beer ""consortium"" during prohibition but now goes legit since the Volstead Act was repealed. He has a real gang of misfits helping him run his beer empire which instead of going great guns is slowly bankrupting him. Bankers are hounding his every footstep and are on the verge of foreclosing on his debts when a windfall of money turns up at his Sarasota Springs home. Five local bandits have stolen the takings for all the local bookies and hidden in his house before his arrival. When Remy arrives with his family there is only one greedy bandit alive who tries to get out with the dough but can't. In the end the money is used to pay off his debts.
The movie tries to be funny but falls flat more often than not. A moment where Remy and his guys are standing around discussing on who's properties they should each place a body doesn't pack the comedic punch it should. Furthermore,the fact that Remy's business is not doing well is because the beer stinks but not one of his men tell him until he finds out himself late in the film;a very unlikely premise and major flaw. However,one scene with an adopted young teen,Douglas(Bobby Jordan of the Dead End Kids),is beautiful. Remy's wife asks why the ""prize(Douglas)hasn't gone to b-e-d?"".Douglas replies""cause I want more to e-a-t,ya c-o-w!"".
""Bullets or Ballots"",released June/36(3 1/2-4 stars),stars Edward G. as Johnny Blake,a tough street smart cop. Johnny's career is sailing along until one day he gets fired by the chief of police,after a departmental shake up. Johnny takes an offer of employment from mob boss Kruger(Barton Maclaine)who enlists him to check out all his operations. Bugs Fenner(Bogart),one of Krugers head men,doesn't like or trust Blake,and with good reason. Unbeknownst to the gang,Blake was fired as a ruse,to infiltrate the gang and break it up. In the end,and with alot of gun shots and blood,Johnny accomplishes the impossible...with his life.
The story is an involving one with Bogie as a mean-as-nails hood and Robinson doing a fine job as a tough cop.
""Each Dawn I Die"",released July/39(3 1/2 -4 stars),stars Cagney as Frank Ross,a crusading newpaperman. Ross is incarcerated in the pen for murdering three people in a car accident while drunk;a total frame up by the local mob boss. Inside he meets a tough mobster by the name of Stacey(Raft).Ross saves Rafts' hide and even goes so far as to do months in the hole on a ruse so Stacy can escape and find out who,and get proof of,Ross's innocence. During the fiery conclusion a confession is made by a fellow inmate(thanks to Stacy)and Ross gets his freedom.
Cagney turns in another powerful performance with a great range of emotions,especially during his incarceration. He is well supported by Raft,Jane Bryan,George Bancroft,Maxie Rosenbloom,and many others.
""San Quentin"",released Aug/37(2 1/2-3 stars),concerns the story of one Steve Jamieson(Pat O'Brien)who gets the job of head yard officer within San Quentin pen. Steve is former Army,and is hired to enact much needed discipline amongst the inmates. He falls for a local singer May(Ann Sheridan),whose brother Joe(Bogie)gets shipped off to San Quentin where he meets up with Steve;and it's not love at first or second sight. Slowly  Steve's actions amongst the men,especially Joe,earn him respect. But Joe gets his head turned back and breaks out with a couple of other cons. Steve heads to Mays apartment and is shot by Joe,who is in turn shot fatally by the cops waiting outside. Joe gets away to die on the steps of San Quentin telling the attending guards Steve was right all along.
""San Quentin"" is a good effort that could have been better. Bogie steals the show here while O'Brien almost sleep walks through and even Sheridan can't wake him up.
""G-Men"",originally released in May/35,is the 1949 re-release version here(a cheat by Warners-3 stars).The film opens up with a /49 FBI man talking to subbordinates in a room with a projector and screen about the film that first mentioned the term ""G-man"".We see the projector screen light up with the Warners logo and the picture zooms in to commence the movie. The story concerns one Brick Davis(Cagney)who plays a lawyer whose fortunes aren't all that well. When a friend gets bumped off by the local mob he joins the government investigation agency(the future FBI).He vows to get revenge on them;a group run by the boss Collins(Barton MacLaine).Brick falls for his group boss Jeffs'(Robert""King Kong"" Armstrong"") sister Kay(Margaret Lindsay),much to Jeff's chagrin. They begin at odds but Brick and Jeff become close friends in the end. Collins ends up kidnapping Kay and it is Brick and company to the rescue.
A pretty good early Cagney effort with a good supporting cast. Watch for Lloyd Nolan in his first role. Would have rated it higher if this had been an original print.
Technically these films do show their ages but generally speaking they are crisp transfers and the contrast is very good. What gets this solid four star rating are the extras. You will find many delightful surprises here with many period shorts,an early Vitaphone short with Bob Hope,vintage cartoons,vintage newsreel clips,multi Warner stars in blooper(or ""breakdowns"")reels for almost every year from /35-/40,multiple featurettes,commentaries and theatrical trailers.
In conclusion though the films here are not on a par with their predecessors in Volume#1,there are still alot of things to delight and discover not only in the films but more so in the extras. I wouldn't rate ""City for Conquest"" as a gangster film(but it's the best of the bunch!) and ""G-Men"" was a re-release print. But I still recommend it for all film buffs.",1248048000,4,7771,4.9861325115562405
3294941,5,B00114XLUA,"Who would mind three great actors and the best to play ganster characters ever: Jimmy Cagney, Bogie and Edward G. Robinson. Each of these movies are gems for their kind taking us back to Prohibition Era, produced during the 30's and the beginning of the 40's.

If you are a Cagney fan then you should try this, for the sake of adding value to your Jimmy collection.

Remember that if you buy each of these movies separately the cost will be considerably consistent and you might try this collection as it offers the same movies and special features.",1245974400,,549,4.591836734693878
3294942,4,B00114XLUA,"I will make this short. Bullets or Ballots gets a 7 out of 10, Each Dawn I Die gets a 6 along with G Men and A Slight Case of Murder. San Quentin was good except the ending was the down fall. I only give it a 4, a one time watching flick. However, City for Conquest gets no less than a 10. This movie alone is worth the pack, with Ann Sheridan and Cagney as the big names. It plays kind of like a Roman play with a homeless man playing a narrator that is in the scene. Cagney will leave speechless, and I who don't get choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Shindler list get that feeling with this. Not that its sadder, but its understable and pure. Its slow at times, but it holds together well. This is the movie I thought the least of when I bought and the one I loved the most. Oh, and my girlfriend also fell in love with this movie, which made me beleive this is one of the most under rated films of all time.",1242345600,,917,3.935483870967742
