WOW.
they talk of a lot of things in MEDIA STUDIES and the like eg: THE MALE GAZE.
that is the point of view of MEN as MEN SEE THINGS.
this film is from 1959 (before GREMAINE GREER et al).

according to this film women ALWAYS go nude swimming and generally satisfy the LUST OF MEN all day.
HO HUM.

of course this is the first real feature of a well know cinematic DEGENERATE called RUSS MEYER.
this film makes ANYTHING by john waters look POETICALLY MASTERFUL (even the last shot of pink flamingos).",1445126400,,600,4.348214285714286
7861343,4,6304030061,"The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959) is the first commercially successful film of director Russ Meyer. The film was described as a nudist comedy and was noted for exhibiting extensive female nudity. The film cost $24,000 to produce and eventually grossed more than $1,500,000 on the independent/exploitation circuit

The only sound in the film is the voice of a narrator and a very monotonic musical theme.

Mr. Teas (Bill Teas) is a door to door salesman for dentists' appliances who delivers on his bicycle. Teas is a clumsy and shy man, who likes to watch happy couples and daydreams when looking down the necklines of women he meets. After undergoing surgery at the dentist, Teas realizes that the anesthetic has overcome her inhibitions, and has give him him X-ray vision, enabling him to see women without their clothes. He is happy at first, but gradually begins to be embarrassed. For example, he goes to the river and sees three girls swimming  on a picnic naked  The three girls are those he sees daily: the dental nurse, a secretary and waitress in the bar. Teas decides to go to a psychoanalyst,whom he also sees her naked. The voiceover says: ""On the other hand, some men are happy to be sick.""

The Immoral Mr. Teas was the first American ""above ground"" movie since the pre-Code early sound era to show female nudity without the pretext of naturism. It is considered to be the first commercially viable American ""skin flick"" and popularized the nudie cutie genre.

The film is beautiful to see with great photography and use of color. It can almost be described as a pin up  magazine come to life. Completely innocent today it is an important breakthrough in movie history and is well worth seeing for this reason alone.",1336953600,3,1725,4.768456375838926
7861344,3,6304030061,"This is Russ Meyer's first venture into stimulating pleasantly adult films... For 1959, it was a big sensation... By today's standards, however, it is quite dull... It is a difficult film to rate because it is so delightful and adorable, but the story is almost nonexistent and certainly dated...

The story is about a dirty-minded voyeur... Through the course of a day, he sees a number of good-looking, big breasted ladies, and tries to attract them for long periods of time... On the weekend, he goes to the beach where he comes across a photographer and a topless model...

Russ Meyer was very careful not to place his characters in sexual situations, but concentrated on rousing the audience... Mr. Teas finds himself with a nude female analyst, for example, but does not try to seduce her...

Such tease was a matter of the film's survival... For the very moment nudity turned into a sexual encounter, it would have certainly been censored...",1232236800,,948,4.875776397515528
7861345,3,6304030061,"To start with, be advised that this movie is definitely not worth it's ...price tag! ....
I first learned about this now classic nudie-cutie movie from the pictorial feature in the November 1960 issue of Playboy magazine.  I didn't go see the movie back then but I remembered it occasionally over the years, and finally decided to add it to my video collection.
I was not disappointed, although the movie was very obviously made on a shoestring budget, with most of it going to the color photography instead of a script or sound recording, since there's no story to speak of and no spoken dialogue.  It's like a silent movie -- you see the characters move their lips but say nothing and there's not even any subtitles!  Very strange.  There is a sporadic, inane narration to tell us what's going on, and a bouncy, somewhat tiresome music score.
But it's the naked babes that make the movie worth watching, of course!  The only purpose of the movie is to show off the natural endowments of the women, most of whom never went on to appear in anything else.  Except for June Wilkinson, of Playboy fame (The Boson -- 1958), who is not even credited here for her walk-on part, but later had  a semblance of a movie career, appearing in some 20 films in small parts showcasing her big parts.
The story, such as it is, follows Mr. Teas (his name really is Teas --  Bill Teas, a friend of Meyer) on his daily rounds as a delivery man for dental appliances.  He makes his rounds on a bicycle, and everywhere he goes he encounters voluptuous women, and he sees them all naked in his imagination.  He undresses them mentally as they do their jobs.  (So how does this make him any different from any of us guys?  And what's immoral about it?  Beats me!)
This was the first of its kind and started the era of the so-called ""nudie movie.""  So it has historical significance along with its bare-breasted beauties.  I recommend it to all fans of the female form, if you can find it a a decent price.",1041292800,14,1983,4.469444444444444
7861346,5,6304030061,"This film is a great example of Russ Meyer's life work.  If you are a fan and do not have this title GET IT.  If you have never seen any of his movies, this is a great example of his work and a great way to see what Russ Meyer is all about.
This movie revolves around Mr. Teas' obsession with women's breasts.  This obsession gives him the ability to see women naked.  This entire film is a masterpiece.  I highly recommend paying the sixty bucks.",978566400,10,447,4.151162790697675
