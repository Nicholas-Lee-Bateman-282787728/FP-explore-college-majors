3622590,1,B001H29F2E,"I received this set a a birthday present, I and the person who bought it for me believed it to be Discovery channel's visually stunning ""Planet Earth"", instead I have this drab, boring 5-set dvd, and not the heart to tell the person who bought it that it's not the right one. I sincerely hope they never ask to watch it with me.",1285804800,3,328,4.222222222222222
3622591,3,B001H29F2E,Would have been much better if it were not for the mediocre filming - certainly does not look like something done in 2008 - must have been on a very skimpy budget.,1279152000,2,163,4.125
3622592,5,B001H29F2E,"This set of discs is the original Planet Earth series created by the National Science Foundation and WQED Pittsburgh.  It is far superior to the BBC Planet Earth, which stole the name from this older series.  If you actually want to learn something, buy this set and not the newer one.  The newer one has great camera shots that won some awards, but the content is elementary school level and has little or nothing to do with earth science.

This DVD set should be more clearly marked that it is the original series from the late 1980s.  Some of the material is a bit out of date.  The general concepts in the programs, however, have not changed much at all.  The disc entitled ""The Living Machine"" is still good enough to show in college classrooms today (if you ignore the old fashioned footage of reel-to-reel magnetic tape drives).  The footage in this film is fantastic and the graphics to show plate tectonics have yet to be equalled in any other production I've seen.  The episodes are definitely not boring.

Overall, this set is highly recommended.",1266019200,11,1057,4.664864864864865
3622593,2,B001H29F2E,"Definitely a conflict here.  The marketing of this product has to be dishonest.  It is not the BBC series ""Plant Earth""  as much of the packaging and title leads a person to believe.  However, the documentaries in this series are pretty good.  They appear to be made in approximately the mid 80's.  I am sure these documentaries were intended to be cutting edge when they were made.  Now they document the history of earth science as much as they document earth science.

The documentaries themselves deserve 5 stars.  The people marketing this product are close to criminal.",1264896000,3,575,4.845360824742268
3622594,3,B001H29F2E,"As others have said, this is a great example of dishonest advertising. The name being so similar to BBC's Planet Earth is questionable and you'd have to be pretty naive to think it's not done on purpose. But much worse is the fact that the tin says copyright 2008. Nowhere does it say when the actual programs were released, at least not in plain sight. Is that even legal? I knew this wasn't Planet Earth, but I didn't think I'd be getting something they showed Kevin Arnold's class in The Wonder Years. Ok, not quite that old, but I'd say late 70's to early 80's. The actual DVD slots are cheaply made too. Some of the discs don't align correctly with the glued on styrofoam (yes, that's right) that is supposed to keep them snug. I had to use my own DVD cases instead.

However, all that being said, the shows ARE good despite their age. They're more scientific in nature than BBC's Planet Earth, which is more of a collection of beautiful scenery with narration. They're roughly analogous to a 9th or 10th grade Earth Science book in scope and level of detail and are probably worth 17 bucks if you don't mind giving your money to a shady company.",1262044800,12,1151,4.454976303317536
3622595,1,B001H29F2E,"My dad bought me what he thought was BBC's Planet Earth but instead bought me this.  I still appreciate the thought but this is hardly the quality of the BBC documentary.  I too agree that the packaging and name is a shady attempt to dupe unaware buyers into shelling out the cash for this instead of the excellent BBC series.  It's a Zony, not a Sony... or a Bioneer to your Pioneer... maybe a Nagnavox to his Magnavox, I think you get the idea.",1261699200,2,446,4.285714285714286
3622596,1,B001H29F2E,"My wife purchased this at a retail store, thinking she had gotten a great deal on BBC's Planet Earth series.  Looking at the packaging, I almost wonder if that's what they were hoping for when they released it.  The way the ""our"" is a smaller font, and the earth is similarly placed, with a similar color scheme is all a bit fishy.  Whether that's true or not, she said it was dry and boring, and not at all what she was hoping for.  If possible, we will be returning this.",1251158400,3,473,4.222222222222222
3622597,5,B001H29F2E,Totally disagree with these other reviews.  These are excellent for middle and high school students as introduction of geology.  These are not focused on fauna and flora except where there may be environmental impacts from air pollution for example.  The seven documentaries (the set includes a bonus nature cd) are produced by KQED public television of Pittsburgh which has a well-deserved reputation for documentaries.,1244073600,9,420,5.53125
3622598,1,B001H29F2E,"I got this as a present and frankly I don't think I specified that I wanted ""Our Planet Earth"" vs. ""BBC Planet Earth"". This is not the latter. It is a lousy documentary and frankly I would return it except I had opened it.

Needless to say if you want the award winning series look for the BBC logo with the words ""Planet Earth"". The BBC one is about 2 times the price of this one.",1241654400,2,381,4.0131578947368425
3622599,1,B001H29F2E,"Much more informative than the BBC documentary series from 2007 entitled ""Planet Earth"". This film - ""OUR Planet Earth"" is really just a lo-fi re-release of a bunch of old, 80's and 90's science b-movie-esque TV. Don't waste your money if you really want to see the HD BBC series...

SUCKS!",1231372800,5,290,4.686274509803922
8307683,5,B001H29F2E,"This is the original PLANET EARTH from 1986. It is about Geology, and possibly the best documentary PBS has ever made, and they have made some truly great ones. If you want to see Parrot Fish swimming around reefs, do not buy this. If you want to learn something valuable and relevant get this.",1521763200,,294,4.462962962962963
8307684,5,B001H29F2E,Pretty good but a little outdated. But great packaging and super fast shipping too. Thank you,1512604800,,93,4.875
8307685,5,B001H29F2E,"I know it's outdated, but it's cool to see the methods they used back then.",1496016000,,75,4.066666666666666
8307686,2,B001H29F2E,"Not what i expected. Not good quality film. I was looking for planet earth series, and this is not it.",1492473600,,102,4.15
8307687,5,B001H29F2E,"I have this series on tape, and it is copyright 1985. Much of the information is still valuable and still current. It is particularly instructive about earth's formation and geology. That was where my interest was captured and I received an excellent basic education that is not contradicted by later scientific discoveries. (The BBC series of the same name is a nature series and not useful if you are interested in how the earth was made or how geology supports and demonstrates theories of the age, life forms and stages of earth development.)

I'm buying this in DVD now so that the information is still in an available format in my library. It is quite possible dates that are later than the original production date reflect years when the material was re-formatted for newer technology, not an attempt to deceive.",1443916800,,819,4.85
8307688,2,B001H29F2E,"This predates the BBC production so it is not trying to trick you. As for the show it seems to be more about the planet and less about wild life of the planet like the BBC one. Want to learn Earth science watch this, want more indepth look into Earth and life on it, watch Planet Earth.",1406073600,,286,4.035087719298246
8307689,5,B001H29F2E,"First of all, ""Our Planet Earth"" is a very well written series of scientific programs which has a companion book to the 1986 PBS series entitled simply ""Planet Earth"" by Jonathan Weiner (a very good read), not ""Our Planet Earth"" as currently being sold.  If anyone is to blame for the confusion some of you are experiencing, it's the BBC for using the same name as the aforementioned earlier documentary.  The company marketing the product at least added the ""Our"" to the title to discriminate between the two without totally changing the name of the original series.  The PBS series is educational at a higher level than the BBC series which is more akin to ""eye candy"".  Both series are worth watching, however; a word to the wise - pay attention to what you're ordering. I've had this series on VHS for years and was thrilled that it was available on DVD.",1386115200,3,858,4.625
8307690,5,B001H29F2E,"This series is excellent, I will continue to use it in my 7th grade geography classes. The material is still very useful in the classroom.",1380672000,,138,4.56
8307691,4,B001H29F2E,I found the series informative and entertaining. It remain so even after it was first aired this is a very good revamp of this series.,1359849600,,134,4.4
8307692,5,B001H29F2E,"I remember the first time I saw this series. I was enraptured. Yes, it was a few years ago, but the narration and material presented are excellent. For the people who are too dumb to realize that they are buying something other than what they wanted (motivated by bargain mania), you really should evaluate the show, not your mistake. Remember, this show came first; so there is no misrepresentation from this set.",1286582400,7,414,4.763888888888889
