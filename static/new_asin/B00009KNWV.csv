7991198,5,B00009KNWV,"I grew up with this animation. Yes I love the book, and I love this series also. I truly disagree lambmom12 review. People can make a decision based on their conscience, not because of animation. Leave God out of this just let the children enjoy the friendship and life.",1448496000,3,270,4.530612244897959

7991201,5,B00009KNWV,"My family loves watching this cartoon together.  It is imaginative, intelligent, and creative. My child (6 yrs old) learns important lessons, great vocabulary and even some of the basics of Greek mythology, literature and history.  We have great conversations after watching each episode! I highly recommend this show for all children.",1359849600,,335,5.549019607843137
7991202,1,B00009KNWV,"If you like the book Anne of Greene Gables and were looking for something good for your children to watch. Beware!! This may  not be it. In the book Marilla teaches Anne about God and Anne goes to church. When she seeks advice she goes to Marilla. Marilla tells her the christian thing to do. In this series Anne has an imaginary friend who is a druid. Anne gets advice from the druid. So instead of going to Marilla or God, now a twelve year old girl is asking an imaginary friend (a sorcerer, magical creature) for help. I don't know any twelve year old's that have imaginary friends. What's wrong with telling the story the way it is. Leave the book alone. People who like Anne like God too.  Come on!",1321401600,39,704,4.325757575757576
