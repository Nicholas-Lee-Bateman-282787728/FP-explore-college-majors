5693155,2,B00C7BZYRO,"I attended the press screening for this movie with high hopes since it was being so closely compared to Perks of Being a Wallflower, which I absolutely adored. Sadly, despite very strong performances from the lead actors, this lacked the heart and sensitive charm of Wallflower, so much so that the collective reaction from the audience at the end of the movie was a: ""What? That's it?""

This film was also so obviously written by young men with no idea of how to write women (the two writers even filmed a brief 2-minute intro, in which they practically begged everyone to like their movie - real professional, guys) . There are two scenes/lines in particular that I had to roll my eyes at - I won't spoil the scenes, but the first in which Sutter's mom yells ""Sutter! Again?"" at a sight at which no mom would ever tolerate just once, let alone multiple times; and second, in which Aimee tells Sutter: ""Let's just forget it and never talk about it again"" which pretty much left me enraged. Aimee's utter lack of self-respect throughout the whole story was very off-putting and sad to watch. Any girl in their right mind would woman up and break it off with such an insufferable and sorry creature, instead of get sucked into his booze-fueled downward spiral. I also found it a bit hilarious that Aimee only suffers a broken arm during one particularly violent scene - but again, it's another example of oversimplified and pat writing.

As to the main character of Sutter, it was hard to empathize with him. Yes, it's sad he inherited the disease from his father, but he does very little to actually overcome it or make himself a better man. There's no redemption for the grief he causes Aimee, and just when it's hinted he MIGHT make amends, you get a sloppy and unsatisfying finale. I kind of hoped Aimee would tell Sutter to off himself before fading to black.

This is not a romantic movie by any means and should not be marketed as such. If there's a genre for ""first love utterly wasted on the wrong person"" then this is that, hands-down.",1386374400,6,2044,4.579234972677596
5693156,5,B00C7BZYRO,"The Spectacular Now is a film adaptation of the popular novel by the same name from author Tim Tharp. The film follows the book fairly closely and is about a popular boy, Sutter Keely, who likes to party way too much, and a shy straight-arrow girl, Aimee, who befriends Sutter and then falls for him. It is at first a very unlikely coupling but Sutter and Aimee grow on each other, each getting something from the other that they couldn't have found on their own. The story follows the young romance as it strengthens and gently unwinds, as most young romances do, because sometimes what you each come to the other as is what you end up remaining, no matter what kind of influences enter your life. I love that the ending is realistic.

The actors couldn't have been more perfect. Miles Teller was so good in Rabbit Hole and he brings to life an entirely different personality here and is a perfect casting. Shailene Woodley was incredible in another of my favorite films, The Descendants, and she too plays a quite different character in The Spectacular Now and so believably so.

I found this film about teens refreshing. For once, kids from blue-collar existences and not upper-middle-class homes are portrayed. And for a change, cookie-cutter characters are nowhere to be found. The ""stoner,"" ""goody two-shoes,""  ""jock"" and ""class clown"" are here, for sure, but as with real people in real life they are fleshed out to portray people with more than one dimension.

There's an excellent supporting cast, especially Kyle Chandler as Sutter's dad.

This film gets you to thinking--or rethinking--about your teen years and where you may--or may not--have fit in. When the ending comes it may take some people by surprise but it weaves in nicely and believably into the web cast by the characters from the beginning of the film.",1384300800,,1827,4.805732484076433

I think I will have to clear room on my Top Ten list for 2013 for this beautiful little film about two teenagers finding each other.  Director James Ponsoldt has affectionately taken Tim Tharp's novel and slowly allows the characters to fall in love while the audience watches.  I can't say enough about Miles Teller (""Project X"") and Shailene Woodley's (proving her performance in ""The Descendants"" was no fluke) strong chemistry together which results in exceptional performances.  Nothing seems like dialog, just extemporaneous words flowing from their mouths.

Sutter (Teller) is a high school senior who is perhaps best known as the class clown.  He's funny, easily approachable and good to be around.  He's not a jock nor the smartest kid in school.  But he likes school.  His biggest problem is that he is drunk most of the time.  Sometimes just pleasantly drunk, sometimes very drunk.  One day after a party, he shows up on the lawn of a classmate he barely knows.  Aimee (Woodley) helps her mom deliver newspapers and her never-seen mom got in late, so Aimee scoops up Sutter and off they go delivering papers at 6 AM.

The casting is perfect for this movie.  Both actors (and supporting actors as well) look and talk like high school seniors.  Neither are the traditional Hollywood studs and starlets you typically find in movies like this.  While I suspect their looks were purposely dressed down, they look...well... average.  So does Sutter's ex-girlfriend and his best friend.  So does Aimee's friend.  How refreshing.  As the shy Aimee and extroverted Sutter spend more time together, bad and good characteristics rub off on each other.  Each helps the other confront their mothers.

In Sutter's case, his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) won't tell him about his father's whereabouts.  It's been years since he's heard from him.  I expected the bomb to be dropped that dad is in prison or something.  When he eventually gets the phone number from his married sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he and Aimee make the 3 hour drive.  Unfortunately dad (Kyle Chandler) is a drunk womanizer, pretty much like his mother suggested.

No matter how old we are, everyone can remember that first love.  It never leaves our memory.  I can promise that ""The Spectacular Now"" will give those memories a bit of a jolt.  This is an authentic film about young love.  Highly recommended.",1384300800,,2406,4.94
5693158,5,B00C7BZYRO,This movie was thought provoking with excellent acting.  Characters were believable and interesting. Plot was real life tempo but also adventurous.  I think this will most appeal to young viewers and parents of teens.  Loved it,1383350400,5,227,5.25
5693159,5,B00C7BZYRO,"The Spectacular Now is this years Perks of Being a Wallflower, and perhaps even better.  I headed into the theater without knowing the story or seeing the trailer (I had only seen its high reviews on Rotten Tomatoes), and I came out knowing I'd seen a great movie.  The movie has a great balance of drama and comedy that is hard to get right.  It is a bare-bones movie, with most of the scenes having to be filmed in one or two takes, and I think that helps the quality of the film.  Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley give great performances here.  You can tell this was a passion project, everyone working on the movie did it because they wanted to, not because of the money.  While the content makes me hesitant to recommend to young viewers, the film is a must for anyone that is in their High School or College years.  Ultimately, the film did not receive the attention it should have, so it's box office numbers suffered.  It will, like Perks, be completely overlooked come awards season even in what I consider a down year.  Still, make sure you see this one when you can.  The Spectacular Now is one of the best films of 2013 and proves that 'Coming of Age' stories still have plenty of life in them.",1381881600,3,1207,4.37219730941704
5693160,5,B00C7BZYRO,"Directed by James Ponsoldt from a screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber based on the novel by Tim Tharp, The Spectacular Now is a marvelously crafted film about teenagers on the threshold of adulthood, centered around the character of Sutter Keely, an amiable slacker (and more-than-borderline alcoholic) who's content to live in what he calls 'the spectacular now' with no thought of - or regard for - the future. Or for the consequences of his actions.

The film begins with Sutter (Miles Teller) working on a college application, responding to an essay question asking him to describe a hardship he's faced. His response is a self-indulgent rant about how everything in his life was going great until his ""perfect high school couple"" girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson) broke up with him over a misunderstanding, which is then shown in flashback, where we learn more about Sutter. Later at a party, he runs into Cassidy again and tries to patch things up with her, only to learn that she's moved on and has a new boyfriend, Marcus (Dayo Okeniyi). Sutter reacts by getting more drunk than usual, ending up passed out on a stranger's lawn with no idea how he got there or where his car is. He is found and woken awake by a girl from his high school named Aimee (Shailene Woodley), who was driving by in the course of delivering newspapers for her mom. Partly out of gratitude and partly because he needs to find his car, Sutter helps Aimee deliver the rest of her papers, and on an impulse asks her to have lunch with him, to which she hesitantly agrees, not being used to being the object of any boy's interest. A relationship begins to develop between the two, in spite of the misgivings of their friends. Aimee's friend Bethany (Ava London) is protective, not wanting Aimee to get hurt because she knows Sutter's party-boy reputation. Sutter's best friend Ricky (Masam Holden) is also concerned because he _knows_ Sutter. He knows that Aimee - who's kind of shy and likes reading sci-fi and Japanese manga - isn't the kind of party-girl Sutter usually gets involved with. And most of all, he knows that, even if Sutter's intentions are harmless, the consequences of his behavior are not.

Many things make The Spectacular Now stand out from the usual Hollywood teens-coming-of-age comedy/drama. One of the best things is how it shows how Sutter's amiable slacker who's content to just drift along is the exception, that most of his friends _are_ conscious of impending adulthood and are concerned about their futures. And they do worry about what they're going to do next and whether they're making the right decisions. Cassidy, for example, voices these concerns when she tries to explain to Cutter - who keeps making impulsive attempts to get back together with her - why she prefers Marcus to him: it's because Marcus, while he's not as much fun to be with, is serious. Marcus has a future ahead of him, a future that he's actively moving towards, a future of the kind that she wants to have, and Sutter... doesn't. There's a sweet and wistful sadness to the scene, a consciousness on Cassidy's part that she's growing up and Sutter just isn't, which she tries to soften by telling him ""You'll always be my favorite ex-boyfriend."" Which is what finally manages to penetrate Sutter's willful obliviousness and makes him realize that it really is over between them.

The cast is truly excellent, giving performances that make their characters - teenaged and adult alike - both believable and sympathetic, even when their short-comings are on painful display.

Highly, highly recommended.",1379808000,,3604,4.874388254486134

5693162,5,B00C7BZYRO,"Directed by James Ponsoldt (Smashed), The Spectacular Now stars Miles Teller as Sutter Keely, a popular high school student that recently broke up with his girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson).  After a night of drinking, Sutter blacks out and eventually wakes up on the front lawn of a schoolmate's house, Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley).  Through sheer coincidence, he enjoys Aimee's company and enlists her help with his flailing school work.  However, Sutter is still dealing with his feelings for his former girlfriend, even though he continues to fall for and spend time with Aimee.  While his classmates are getting into college, Sutter struggles with his fears of the future as he works at his job, blows off vital schoolwork, and constantly drinks - so much so that he starts to question his choices and place in the world.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kyle Chandler, and Jennifer Jason Leigh also star in supporting roles.

The Spectacular Now, based on the novel of the same name (written by Tim Tharp), is perfectly described by its title - spectacular.  There are very few coming-of-age films that focus on the serious tone of teen adolescence, young love, and dealing with difficult choices in regards to the future.  This particular story clearly has its finger directly on the pulse of the new generation and is full of smart, quick-witted dialogue.  The tale of Sutter Keely follows a true, honest course, sending the film in an emotionally fulfilling and sincere direction, which is a direction most generic young adult films completely avoid.  Naturally, there have been recent teen flicks that carry a heavy tone, but The Spectacular Now just does it better, having a similar feel films, like The Breakfast Club or The Perks of Being a Wallflower.

In the majority of teen films these days, filmmakers are usually so focused on partying, sex, and comic relief (ex. American Pie, Project X, The To Do List, etc.) that they never bother to add any heart to their stories.  Initially, The Spectacular Now's story appears to be focused on teens falling in love, but it quickly becomes evident that the message of this film is so much stronger than a clichd, one-dimension love story.  Teens are usually depicted as casual, happy-go-lucky kids that can expect to get the girl/boy, ignore consequences, and just wait for a happy ending.  However, this film portrays teens in a serious light, focusing on how one single person has the ability to impact or change another person's life.  Better yet, it spotlights the real life choices young people are forced to make and how these choices can have dire consequences.

Miles Teller, a young actor known for playing the role of the typical teen party animal (as seen in his roles in Project X and 21 & Over), really steps into this dramatic role quite nicely.  Compared to his previous roles, it was a bit of a stretch for him to pull off this emotionally uncertain, borderline alcoholic character.  Teller's charisma is truly intoxicating and mesmerizing, giving him endless potential for future roles and making him easily comparable to well-known actor Shia LaBeouf.  Teller's co-star, Shailene Woodley, is also a relatively unfamiliar face to the big screen - most well-known for her role in The Descendants or possibly even for being cast as Mary Jane Watson in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (only to be cut from the film after she finished filming her scenes).  Regardless, she's a rising star and it's very evident in her role as Aimee Finecky.  Even though Woodley is not as charismatic as Teller, she still provides a handful of screen-stealing scenes - most notably of which comes during a heated exchange in a car with co-star Teller.  As far as the rest of the cast goes - it's impossible not to mention Kyle Chandler's appearance as a deadbeat dad, which is ironic since it's the complete opposite of the character he previously played for five seasons on TV's Friday Night Lights.

Overall, The Spectacular Now features a plot and cast that exudes potential and excitement. There's no denying the sheer genius in the film's writing and direction - indicating director James Ponsoldt might also have a potentially fruitful career on the horizon.  This film deals with relatable themes involving the difficulties teens face while balancing the stresses of school, relationships, and family life.  Even more notable is the underlying theme depicting the possibly devastating effect alcohol can have on self-esteem and the decision-making process.  And, while teen films typically end in the same predictable manner, this story stays true to its roots, creating a purely pragmatic story from beginning to end.  It might not have the most desirable ending, but it is the most logical ending.  Collectively, this coming-of-age drama is an absolute breath of fresh air and is highly recommended.

5693163,4,B00C7BZYRO,"""The Spectacular Now"" (2013 release; 95 min.) brings the story of Sutter (played by Miles Teller), a HS senior who is enjoying life in the moment, with no worry in the world as long as he has his whisky flask or other alcoholic beverages nearby (which is all the time). One day Sutter gets dumped by his girlfriend Cassidy and after a drunken night out, he wakes up in someone's front yard (not knowing how he got there). He gets found by Aimee (played by Shailene Woodley), a HS classmate of his. Aimee is the complete opposite of Sutter in every which way: withdrawn, smart, considerate. Yet Sutter takes an interest in her. Along the way, we learn that Sutter is dealing with `daddy issues'.  His dad left when he was a little kid. Sutter confronts his mom to try and get his dad's contact details. Will Aimee fall for Sutter? what about the other way around? And what's with this mysterious past of Sutter's dad? why did Sutter's parents really break up? To tell you much more of this plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments:  this is the third feature film from director James Ponsoldt, who just last year brought us another top quality indie movie called Smashed (starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul). Interestingly, alcohol dependency also plays a critical role in this movie. The script is based on the book by Tim Tharp (I did not read the book, so cannot comment to what extent, if any, the movie's plot deviates from the book). Despite the gorgeous movie poster and the cute trailer for the movie, ""The Spectacular Now"" is at times not an easy movie to watch, in the sense that Sutter is a mostly unlikeable and self-absorbed jerk whom you'd like to give a slap in the face and yell ""wake up!"". When Sutter gets dumped by Cassidy, his boss at work comments ""I really thought she would be the one to yank you out of neutral"", to which Sutter responds ""But I'm in overdrive!', completely clueless. All the more credit to Teller for playing this character with authority and credibility. But what about Woodley's performance! After playing lead in TV's ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"", she burst out of nowhere on the big screen a few years ago in ""The Descendants"" (playing George Clooney's on-screen daughter). It is Woodley's screen time that makes this movie as enjoyable as it is in the end. And if you wonder about that quote I put in my review title: just watch the movie...

This movie made a splash when it debuted at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, and it's easy to see why. So glad this finally made it to Cincinnati. This opened here today at the local art-house theatre, and the matinee screening that I saw this at was very well attended, I am happy to say. I read somewhere that this movie was shot on a budget of just $2.5 mill., mere peanuts in Hollywood terms, and proving once again you don't needs a comic action hero or a $200 mill. budget to make a movie that engages the audience. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a top quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Spectacular Now"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377216000,56,3229,4.562068965517241
5693164,4,B00C7BZYRO,"This entry from the US to the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival worried me. I was afraid it was going to be non-stop talking heads. We join a blabbermouth young man who is clearly a sociopath, finds all the right words, charms all in his path and serves his own needs, all the while taking liberal sips from his ever-present whiskey flask. We soon realize he is experiencing black-out drunks, so we start to worry. Eek!

When Director James Ponsoldt crafts a second-act meeting with the young man's long-absent father, things start to gain traction.

We watch:
  * Miles Teller (""Footloose"" 2011) is our hard-partying hero, never at a loss for words, impervious to insults and indifferent to school. This charming character is a far cry from his pathetic lost boy in ""Rabbit Hole."" Good for Teller!
  * Shailene Woodley (""The Descendants"") is the awkward misfit who is unexpectedly targeted by our hero. It starts as a lark, but once he gets to know her...
  * Jennifer Jason Leigh (""Revenge"") is our hero's mother, distracted by her responsibilities and reluctant to mar his happy memories of his father.
  * Kyle Chandler (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is that absent father, whom he tracks down so they can reminisce about his happy childhood.

Several things were said that I appreciated: a Geometry teacher says, ""If a student fails, the teacher fails."" A classmate meets with him and as he leaves he turns and says, ""You're not the joke everyone thinks!"" A friend says he needs ""someone to yank you out of neutral!""

This is notable for several extremely long scenes between the two young stars. Very few older actors can sustain scenes this long. Kudos!

5693351,3,B00C7BZYRO,"[Moderate Spoilers] Superstar-waiting-to-happen Miles Teller (""Footloose"" remake) plays ""Sutter,"" and the equally likable Shailene Woodley plays his teen love interest ""Aimee,"" though initially it's not entirely clear if Sutter's heart is in it, likely because of, we discover, a distant relationship with his father (Emmy-winner Kyle Chandler, TV's ""Friday Night Lights,"" barely in the movie for 10 minutes, in the final third).  Also, Jennifer Jason Leigh (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" to remind fans of that classic how old we really are, LOL) plays Sutter's Mom.  The entire cast exudes confident, higher-level acting that make it worthwhile, but it's hardly the highly praised film it's been revered to be, and high expectations go mostly unrealized, though it's still more sophisticated and realistic than your normal teen drama.  Only recommended for fans of the four main stars and for young adults as this otherwise fine film, with a viewer friendly ending, isn't likely to transcend to wider, general audiences.  [Note to producers:  Why not just trim 5 seconds to get a more family friendly PG-13 rating instead of the existing, unnecessary R rating?]",1478131200,,1165,5.3791208791208796
5693362,2,B00C7BZYRO,"...the actors sucked. They did a good job. My anger and frustration is because I'm working as an addictions counselor. This movie seems to imply that addiction is a matter of logic. ""I guess this isn't good for me, so I'll stop."" This could not be more false or dangerous to believe. I am IRATE that the writers/directors/producers chose to push this interpretation of the addiction problem. This is what makes my job so hard. Addictions clients come to me being told by their families that they need to straighten up because their lives/kids/jobs/health is on the line. Addiction doesn't care what's on the line. Addiction is a mental and physical DISORDER and recovery is a life-long commitment. This picture only further promotes the belief that addiction is a choice, and I could not be more disgusted and angry with this interpretation.",1478044800,,841,4.929577464788732

In spite of the swearing, fornication, and alcoholism (yes. I have a moral compass, so I will mention these things), this film is a fantastic examination of human brokenness and dysfunction. Sutter Keely, in spite of his rough edges, is such a charming character. Watching him on screen was a delight. But more charming was watching his relationship with Aimee unfold. The film makers did a fantastic job of making the relationship between these characters genuine. It's impressive how humanly the filmmakers portray both the compatibility of Aimee and Sutter and the dysfunctionality that inevitably comes into their relationship.
This brings me to my favorite aspect of this movie: it reveals the devastating impact absentee fathers have on their children. The key impact in Sutter case is that his father's absence robs him of the ability to endure hardship and fills him with paralyzing fear. Ultimately, the absence of his father makes Sutter incapable of facing difficulties, and he runs away from people when they get too close.
The really great thing about this film it ends in hope.
