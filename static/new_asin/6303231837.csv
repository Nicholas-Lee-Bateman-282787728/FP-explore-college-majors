606738,5,6303231837,"This is a wonderful family flick for all ages and boasts a ""who's who"" list of very funny character actors from the 1960's.  Tony Curtis is outrageously funny and charming as Steve McClusky, a Nevada casino manager who winds up caring for Penny, a 5 year old orphan with amusing results.  Suzanne Pleshette as a romantic endeavor never looked better.  And Phil Silvers' portrayal as the loveable tough guy Uncle Bernie can't be topped.  The ""chase"" scene thru vintage Disneyland is pure fun.  This movie truly is a family classic!

This is a great movie, director Norman Jewison's first film, and this is shameful disrespect by Universal Studios with a DVD-R release. This film is deserving a Blu-ray treatment.

But we take as we get them......

Being the owner, he is put in charge of her care and quickly enlists the help of the beautiful singer who's in residence for her show, Chris Lockwood (Suzanne Pleshette). You can only imagine the kind of trouble that could happen with a little girl running around so at first Curtis is reluctant and decides he needs to get her out as soon as possible. Not surprisingly, after some time he begins to really care for her. A sweet heart-warming story with plenty of comedy this film is a lesser known treasure!",1486684800,5,798,4.326666666666667

607244,4,6303231837,"Fun filled enjoyable 3rd play on the Little Miss Marker story.  The first was the original Shirley Temple story, the second was Sorrowful Jones with Bob Hope, this was the 3rd and the 4th starred Walter Mathau, Julie Andrews and Tony Curtis again (not in the lead role).  This was perhaps the most fun of the bunch with Tony Curtis in charge of a casino in Lake Tahoe who finds himself stuck with a lovable tot when her father disappears.  It was the first movie ever allowed to film in Disneyland and you have some views of the fun land and a chase scene that the children will really get a kick out of.  Suzanne Pleshette, beautiful as always, is the new singer - wink wink- niece of the casino owner, but no one realizes she actually is Bernie The Butcher's real niece.  As the romance blossoms they both fall for the irresistible little girl too.  7 year old Claire Wilcox wins everyone over and her greatest wish is to go to Disneyland which, when they find that her father is dead, they are determined to make come true.  Curtis is in the midst of a legal battle with his wealthy ex-wife who after a bitter divorce is determined to nail him with everything she can.  He cannot go back to California or he will be served with summons and warrants.  Now the real challenge is there if he is determined to get to Disneyland.  This is a nice relaxing comedy for all and well worth the watch.",1427328000,,1393,4.364341085271318

607321,5,6303231837,"This has always been one of my favorite Tony Curtis films. Curtis as Steve McCluskey runs a Nevada hotel-casino for big wheel Bernie Friedman, played to the hilt by Phil Silvers, where a losing customer leaves his small daughter (Claire Wilcox) and in typical situation comedy fashion Curtis falls for the boss' niece (Suzanne Pleshette) sent to headline her singing act and Curtis tries save the kid from the foster home all at the same time. Neatly directed by the extremely competent and talented Norman Jewison, this film is a lot of fun. An expert cast including Kevin McCarthy, Larry Storch, Tom Reese, Warren Stevens, Howard Morris and Stubby Kaye, a solid screenplay by Marion Hargrove, a lively score by Mort Lindsey and some very nostalgic and slapstick scenes shot on location in Disneyland really enhance the entertainment value of this film. This is Tony Curtis at his best and he makes a great romantic team with Suzanne Pleshette. This is great fun for the whole family. I saw this in the theater when I was a kid and I really like this movie.",1414713600,,1058,4.755434782608695

607421,5,6303231837,"This is a boring, tired '60's movie with predictable plot, acting and writing.  But it IS noteworthy for the fact that 20 minutes of this movie was filmed inside Disneyland in 1962, and for Disney-people this is remarkable!  You can get a sense of what the Park was like when it was only 7 years old....or for you old-timer's (like me,) it is a trip in your personal Wayback Machine.  This movie also gives an interesting glimpse of what Lake Tahoe casinos were like in the early sixties.  It's an okay-cute movie.

A WORD OF WARNING:  If you order this from Amazon...even if you only want it because of the Disneyland connection....Amazon will then recommend EVERY OTHER Tony Curtis movie ever made. UGH!

When I saw it on Amazon I ordered it but just ordered it on the inexpensive VHS. I'm happy to say the tape is in excellent condition and shows beautifully on my 60 inch screen. No dullness or graininess at all.  This movie holds up well as a very light hearted, fun but still very touching movie.  The little girl just makes the whole thing successful. She was just precious and did a wonderful job.  As I've always said, adnauseum, I find Suzanne Pleshette very limited as an actress but she did o.k. in this.  Tony Curtis was perfect for the role.  He is a lot better actor than I ever thought he was.  The dopey Bronx voice fits this role perfectly.

607496,4,6303231837,"Really cute movie with fantastic footage of Disneyland and a bygone era.  I purchased this for the Disneyland footage but the movie itself is charming with Tony Curtis and Suzanne Pleshette.  A top-notch casino manager, is suddenly left with a youngster in his lobby, what to do?  Children don't belong in casino lobby's!

Additionaly, the (mob) boss's (Phil Silvers in a great cameo), niece (Pleshette) is going to play the club and is expeted by her uncle to do very well, whether or not by her own merit, and Curtis is left in charge to make it happen.  Curtis and Pleshette, as presumed, become romatically involved while playing pseudo-parents to the abandoned little girl who just wants to go to Disneyland.

No award winner but really cute with splendid scenery of a bygone time.  The first (and I think only) film to have been shot partially at Disneyland, with 20 minutes of footage from the park.",1368057600,2,906,4.769230769230769

Tony Curtis is outrageously funny and charming as Steve McClusky, a Nevada casino manager who winds up caring for Penny, a 5 year old orphan with amusing results. Suzanne Pleshette as a romantic endeavor never looked better. And Phil Silvers' portrayal as the loveable tough guy Uncle Bernie can't be topped. The ""chase"" scene thru vintage Disneyland is pure fun. This movie truly is a family classic!

This is a great movie, director Norman Jewison's first film, and this is shameful disrespect by Universal Studios with a DVD-R release. This film is deserving a Blu-ray release.

But we take as we get them......

UPDATE: 02.21.10 - a little viewing 411

Despite the claim that this disc may play only in ""Play Only"" players, I've found my copy plays fine in my Toshiba DVD burner AND in all of my optical drives on three computers.",1266105600,10,958,4.718562874251497
607785,3,6303231837,"Like the airline industry, home video seems to be veering toward the cutting of corners in order to stay afloat at a profit. Is it nice to finally see FORTY POUNDS OF TROUBLE in it original 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio? Yes. Is it nice to see the entire film, minus commercial interruptions and at its original length?  Yes.  Is the print good?  Not really -- there's no crispness and a fuzz that dims the Panavision perspective, especially on an LCD TV.  Do I like having no idea how long this DVD-R disc will last?  No. Was it worth the $14.99 I paid for it? Yes, as it would cost nearly this much to see it once in a NY revival house theater.

Here's the point: I'm collecting these Universal Vault Series titles, but with caution.  Whereas the sky would be the limit if the discs were pressed, it means I'm holding back.  For starters, I'd rather get a Region 2 PAL edition from the UK if it's a standard pressed DVD (I strongly advocate getting a region free DVD player -- you would be amazed how cheap titles are on Amazon's UK site, and how many U.S. films are being released there rather than here). Additionally, the way Amazon is vacillating its prices, I won't touch one of these Universal Vault discs until it hits the $14.99 mark. It changes by the hour, with the same title vaulting between $14.99 and $17.99 (it's like day trading for film buffs).

Again, it's nice to see this film in widescreen, but I would have bought it sooner from the UK had it been available. That's where I found GAMBIT, THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH and some others in the DVD-R series, some of them even on all-region Blu-ray. Branch out, movie collectors -- there are so many more options out there than we're aware of.  Meantime, we have to be careful. The Warner Archive series is notorious for shipping out defective discs (HAYWIRE is impossible to find unscathed), and when you try to warn other buyers about specific titles, they censor your reviews. Amazon's THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER had digital break-up on my player, and when I rewound to play it back, the break-up was gone, which leads one to believe that these discs will never play the same way twice.

If this is the future of home video, I'm concerned...",1266019200,55,2216,4.515
607786,4,6303231837,"Tony Curtis stars as Steve McClusky, a casino manager that gets into all kinds of goofy trouble with various cast of characters-from a cute 5 yr old girl to his money hungry ex-wife.

One thing I really love about this 1962 movie is that most of the scenes are shot in genuine locations. Nothing beats being able to see old scenes of a familiar place, like stepping onto a time-machine.

It was also a trip seeing those old ""Motorola"" walkie-talkies in the shirt pockets of those casino pit-bosses. Suzanne Pleshette looks beautiful and glamorous. The interaction between Steve and Penny is charming and cute.

Also, Tony Curtis making a reference to the ""Twilight Zone"" was pretty humorous considering several of the supporting actors were in various episodes of the Twilight Zone. Remember the one where an old guy runs over a kid and then his car comes alive to torment him? The tall, gray-haired fella with glasses[Herman] starred in that one.

Old Disneyland scenes, charming interactions, and Tony Curtis himself make this a nice and entertaining little romp for the entire family. Maybe after viewing the movie you'll say out loud ""I wanna go to Disneyland!""",1234828800,5,1165,4.928571428571429

The first film at Disneyland.

Story a simple 1960's film.  I liked Suzanne's character.

Interesting to see old casinos.

Disneyland fan I am seeing the park in color early 1960's is great.  Monorail & Matterhorn.  Incorrect shots-getting off the Monorail & they are looking at Sleeping Beauty Castle?

Apparently Walt moved it for the film?  Ha ha.

The use of the park I thought was great.

Whether you are a Disney fan or not and just looking for a simple, no curse words, no nudity comedy then you can enjoy this film.  Films are NOT made like this today, clean cut film.

607789,5,6303231837,"An internet search of movies that had Disneyland scenes in them led me to ""40 Pounds of Trouble.""  I bought this video because I wanted high-quality movie footage of Disneyland during 1962.  That, I got, in addition to an entertaining little comedy.

I should know better--but I live near Lake Tahoe, and the opening car chase scene puts the tunnel of US-50 on the wrong side of the state line.  Reporters slant news items for maximum drama, so it is silly of me to expect pure drama and comedy to correspond to the ""real world.""

But as far as I can tell, the Disneyland scenes are mostly accurate.  I didn't see Disneyland in person until 1972, and in 1962 I was all of five years old and in Europe, so check with other sources.  The movie showed that there was a second entrance and exit to Disneyland--the Monorail.  Many of Disneyland's rides and attractions appeared:  Nature's Wonderland,  the tree house on Tom Sawyer Island, the rafts to Tom Sawyer Island, Pirate Ship Restaurant, Autopia, the Disneyland Railroad, and the Matterhorn Bobsleds.  Some of these attractions are gone, and the rest have changed in the last 45 years.  One plot device was the sound of the bell on the fire engine and the Mark Twain's whistle being overheard through a telephone between the Matterhorn and the House of the Future.

I enjoyed this movie on its own merits, and was satisfied with high-quality movie footage of Disneyland in the past.  I do have questions about how the Disneyland scenes were made.  There is no mention of Disneyland in the credits.",1167264000,9,1549,4.70631970260223
607790,5,6303231837,"This has always been one of my favorite Tony Curtis films. Curtis as Steve McCluskey runs a Nevada hotel-casino for big wheel Bernie Friedman, played to the hilt by Phil Silvers, where a losing customer leaves his small daughter (Claire Wilcox) and in typical situation comedy fashion Curtis falls for the boss' niece (Suzanne Pleshette) sent to headline her singing act and Curtis tries save the kid from the foster home all at the same time. Neatly directed by the extremely competent and talented Norman Jewison, this film is a lot of fun. An expert cast including Kevin McCarthy, Larry Storch, Tom Reese, Warren Stevens, Howard Morris and Stubby Kaye, a solid screenplay by Marion Hargrove, a lively score by Mort Lindsey and some very nostalgic and slapstick scenes shot on location in Disneyland really enhance the entertainment value of this film.
