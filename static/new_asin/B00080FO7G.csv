8055010,5,B00080FO7G,"I teach tai chi, and studied (and continue to study) Yang style under a sifu who learned directly from Doc-Fai Wong. I ordered this because I wanted to see which applications he demonstrated, and to see if this would be a good resource for my students who wanted to practice more between classes.

First off, let me say that you can't really learn tai chi from a video--any video, even this one. Even the best video can't look at you and help you evaluated your alignment and so on, and you can't practice applications with a video. However, if you're studying Yang style tai chi with a teacher and/or in a class, this video is an excellent adjunct to your practice.

Anyone who has ever taken tai chi classes will attest that one of the hardest parts is to remember what you've learned in class once you've gotten home. Also, a lot of tai chi classes don't stress the applications, and this is a good way to get a sense of what intention should be behind the movements you're doing in the form.

Again, don't expect to learn ""tai chi"" from this video or any other. But if you're a tai chi student looking to fill in some blanks in your understanding or a useful practice aid and memory jogger, you can't do better than this video.",1382572800,5,1231,4.41409691629956
8055011,5,B00080FO7G,I am writing a review for this dvd because there are none currently and I was unsure whether this was worth getting when I ordered it. I am glad I did order it. Grandmaster Doc-Fai Wong is highly highly skilled and is very good at explaining the movements. i have been doing Yang 24 form for about 10 years and think this dvd will really help me get to a higher level with my ability. Thanks for making this excellent dvd.,1349913600,5,422,4.222222222222222
