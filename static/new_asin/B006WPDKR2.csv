5025705,5,B006WPDKR2,"My husband and I loved this documentary.  What a terrific recap of the most historical moments in rock radio.  I only wish my father were alive to watch this, as this movie literally depicted his youth - as remembered through rock and roll. Growing up listening to all of his ""golden oldies,"" this movie brought back wonderful memories for me. I also learned so much about the progression of rock music, as seen through the eyes and ears of the original DJs themselves. Will watch again and again.",1352764800,2,497,4.636363636363637

5025707,4,B006WPDKR2,"My dad grew up listening to a deejay in Philadelphia named Hy Litt on AM radio.  Airplay was a gift for him.  I watched it with him and was surprised how much I got into a film for the baby boomer generation.  I am a music guy who listens to sixties music and enjoys the classics like Dead, Doors and Airplane. I came for the soundtrack and stayed for the movie because it was more than a baby boomer nostalgia trip.

It's more about how artists in America wind up getting the boot of government and corporate America on their neck for bucking the powers that be with anything fresh and new.  Also a not so subtle subtext of racism and how the DJs fought it in the music they played and the dances and concerts they held for teenage kids from the 50s and early 60s. I see the parallel between hip hop artists today and the early rock and roll DJs.

Not as big a topic as ""Inside Job"" or ""Waiting for Superman"" but it has lots of appeal, with a different look than most docus. Editing rocks. Style reminds me of the Kid stays In Picture docu about Robert Evans, editing and design that's lots of movement and out of the ordinary.

The basic story:

Birth of AM Radio:  The first part shows how the white AM station owners saw how much young people liked rhythm and blues sung by African American artists played by African American disk jockeys and imitated them with white Deejays.  These personalities talked to kids and played them songs that drove their parents crazy.

Personality DJs Across America:  A tour of America's popular DJs in about 1960. Here's the kind of story told; a New York DJ named Cuz Brucie  is sso tight with his teenage listeners, when a kid runs away from home, the DJ right on the air negotiates a way back with the kid and his parents.  Imagine that happening today.

Payola Scandal:  This was a new one to me, and sad.  This was not so much about paying DJs for playing records, which seemed to be legal at the time,  as government control of the media.  You can say it was a different time, like the McCarthy era, but you would be wrong.  It's like a Congressional Committee calling in all the hip hop DJs and ruining their careers. You would have to say there's a hint of racism there.  Liked this part a lot, with a very funny interview with Dick Clark na d a very sad one with Joe (Finney?) who lost his career.

Top 40:  After payola, deejays had to do what they were told by station managers and this killed any innovation on the air.

Birth of FM: In New York and San Fran, a new crop of DJs began playing the music that became the Sixties sound, Airplane, Doors, Dead.  They were the pioneers for the baby boomers who wanted to change society.  Very funny stoned on the air stories from, and the iconic acts when they were just paying in dives.

Death of FM: FM radio was a victim of two forces: owner greed which turned the stations into products with market research and so-called consultants who called the shots instead of the DJs and government meddling again in the hands of Nixon, the Watergate president's goons who threatened station owners with loss of license.

80s - Satellite;  80s music is something most people like and there was a revival of the personality DJ that got crushed when Reagan deregulate station owners who could now buy as many as they wanted.  Clear Channel, run by ex used car salesman, pounded all the nails into the pioneering DJs coffin.

Satellite radio goes from it's birth to merger of XM and Sirius.  There could be more here.

Airplay is a good gift for a parent of baby boomer generation because its very  informative and entertaining.  It has some of the irony of a Michael Moore documentary without MM hogging the scene himself.

My father would go 5 stars, I would say 4 because I was not around then to hear the DJs the first time.  Sorry I missed it now.",1335484800,15,3837,4.38385269121813
5025708,5,B006WPDKR2,"Airplay: The Rise and Fall of Rock Radio is a very insightful look into the birth of Rock n Roll Radio in the 50's, starting with the WDIA (Memphis) DeeJays (which included the one and only BB King) all the way up to the birth of satellite radio in the 80's. From Elvis's first record through The Payola scandal and the birth of Top 40 radio the documentary is beautifully told  through the DeeJays that lived the experiences; Casey Kasem, Alan Freed, Rufus Thomas, Dick Biondi, Jocko Henderson and Cousin Brucie to name just a few. 60's and 70's jocks tell about the opening of the FM dial and the newfound freedom to program radio shows as they saw fit. Murray The K, Pete Fornatele, Alison Steele, Tom Donahue, JJ Jackson, Jim Ladd, Scott Muni and others. The list goes on and on as DeeJays from all over the country were interviewed for the documentary. Rock stars, Grace Slick, David Crosby, Graham Nash and Stephen Stills also make appearances and share their stories and provide insight to the ever changing world of Rock Radio. Fast paced, very informative, highly entertaining and a great blast from the past. I could not recommend this more! I only wish it were longer or a multiple DVD series like Ken Burns' Jazz series.",1335398400,14,1232,4.6255707762557075
5025709,5,B006WPDKR2,"This film tells a true story about rock and roll history that hasn't been told before. From the early days of the 50s to the 80s ""personality"" disc jockeys across the country played rock and roll music for the first time and also talked to teenagers on the air about their problems and issues, from girl and boy problems in the 50s to  social problems late in the 60s.  Young people across the country heard the same music at the same time which does not happen now, except on Sirius.  The  rock music disc jockeys made plenty of enemies among parents, church groups,, and politicos who struck back in a kind of kangaroo court called the Payola hearings . That shows you how the culture wars started long before Red and Blue states, and how the most  popular disc jockey of the day was destroyed by politicians.
 I would recommend this movie to rock and roll fans. it's very fast and has many of the rock stars who were made on radio, like Crosby Stills and Nash, the Grateful Dead,  Grace Slick, the Doors  about how certain disc jockeys gave them their first breaks. i grew up listening  to a disc jockey in this film, Rick Shaw. The story he tells about the Beatles could not happen today, either.
  The film's music track pushed all my buttons in a good way.
  This was a very entertaining film. It could have been longer and gone into more detail from time to time,  but that was probably the trade off to make it flow with good energy.",1335312000,2,1441,4.388679245283019
5025710,5,B006WPDKR2,"This is a baby boomers dream --- and a piece of history for Gen X and Gen Y. The author presents a well-researched piece on the DJ's of the era. The music will make you wish for a convertible, a milkshake, a bucket of fries and an outdoor movie theater (remember those days?).

A sweet and intelligent blast from the past!",1335312000,3,322,4.278688524590164
5025711,3,B006WPDKR2,"Being a lifelong radio buff I was very excited to learn of the DVD release of the 2008 documentary ""Airplay:  The Rise and Fall of Rock Radio"".  One of the primary reasons I ordered this disc was the fact that the film had aired on public television.  I had visions of a program that would be something akin to the outstanding PBS series ""Pioneers of Television"".  But alas, this one does not quite measure up to those lofty standards. Nevertheless, for those who lived through those halcyon days of rock & roll radio and who long for a time when music on the radio really mattered ""Airplay"" is a program that is probably still worth a look.

At age 60 I am a little too young to remember the earliest days of rock & roll radio. Actually, as the legendary Memphis DJ and recording artist Rufus Thomas points out in the film the term ""rock & roll"" is actually a misnomer.  What all those teenagers were turning on to in the early and mid 1950's was actually ""rhythm & blues"" which would eventually morph into what we now call rock & roll.  I envy them because it must have been an incredibly exciting time. One of the strengths of ""Airplay"" is that it presents interviews with a number of the most influential deejays of the period.  Among the featured deejays are Jerry Blavat from Philadelphia, Dick Biondi from Chicago, ""Cousin Brucie"" Morrow from New York City and the legendary Martha Jean ""The Queen"" Steinberg who at the time was an enormously influential African-American broadcaster at WDIA in Memphis. ""Airplay"" also features several rare clips of the legendary Alan Freed as well as an extensive interview with his son Lance. In those days disc jockeys really mattered and it seems that every teen had their favorite. Formats were much less resticted and unlike today these jocks had considerable latitude in what music they could play. Deejays took a great deal of pride in breaking hot new singles while some took a great deal of money known as ""payola"" for putting a record on the air.  As I said it was a very exciting time to be a teen.  Many white parents strongly objected to what they considered to be ""The Devil's Music"" but with the introduction of transistor radios in the mid 1950's they could exert precious little control over their offspring.  Watching ""Airplay"" really does give you a feel for what it must have been like all those years ago.

For a variety of reasons discussed in the film rock and roll radio would evolve into ""Top 40"" radio in the early 1960's.  Most veteran deejays hated the change because one of the major drawbacks of the Top 40 format was that they now had considerably less latitude in selecting the songs they could play.  Personally I enjoyed Top 40 radio on the AM dial during my teenage years in the 1960's primarily because most of the disc jockeys were still personalities while the vast majority of radio stations were locally owned and operated. But alas, the Top 40 format would become much too predictable as time wore on and its popularity began to wane. In the early 1970's a new phenomenon known as AOR (album-oriented rock) began to emerge on the FM dial. You can hear all about it in ""Airplay"" from some of the leading jocks of the period.

So here we are in the year 2012 and I think most will agree that music radio is just a shell of its former self.  The influence of highly paid consultants and the dominance of radio by mass media conglomorates like Clear Channel and Entercom have definitely taken their toll.  ""Airplay"" examines the reasons why all of this has taken place and speculates whether satellite radio might offer any hope for the future.  As I indicated earlier ""Airplay:  The Rise and Fall of Rock Radio"" did not quite live up to my expectations.  Overall, I found the presentation to be rather blase.  This is not a terrible film but frankly it is not something I would go out of my way to see again.  It could have been much better. For me it is ""one and done"" and as such I can only offer a lukewarm recommendation on this one.",1335225600,14,4017,4.542302357836339

5025733,5,B006WPDKR2,"Airplay takes us on a magical mystery tour through the decades of Rock & Roll Radio that grew up with baby boomers  and vice versa.

There was an energy in the air at the dawn of Rock & Roll Radio that Airplay captures with flair. Carolyn Travis and crew masterfully refresh our memories and flood our minds with images of yesterday.

From baby steps to saddle shoes, pleated skirts to miniskirts, Airplay is a great trip down Memory Lane, through the thoughts and clips of some of radios greatest DJs.

It couldn't have been easy to review, select, and edit the monumental amount of vintage clips and airchecks for inclusion. But Airplay offers terrific snippets of life and politics with a backdrop of radios most influential Rock & Roll Radio stations.

Big disc jockey names, big stations, big hit records, big industry ups and big downs, are all presented in flashbacks and personal memories. Alan Freed, Dick Clark, Casey Kasem, Cousin Brucie, Jerry Blavat, Martha Jean The Queen, Tom Donahue, and so many more, are brought back to us in engaging and often rare, clips.

Stemming from an un-PC era, Airplay faces discrimination head-on and demonstrates how radio and its listeners of all races embraced black, R&B music, blended with jazz, ragtime, and country, to fuse forever, Rock & Roll Radio.

Through the payola scandal, The British Invasion, the Vietnam war, and Disco, Airplay presents vintage and current interviews revealing startling facts and amusing antics.

Boomers want to remember and reenergize, and Millennials are excited and curious  Airplay satisfies all generations.",1437696000,,1594,5.076628352490421
5025734,5,B006WPDKR2,"I saw the somewhat abbreviated version of this really fund - and well-researched - documentary when it played on my local PBS station about five years ago. I wasn't aware that the full - 90 minute - version was released on DVD (in 2012) until now. So I'm a bit ""late to the game"" in posting my review.
In the early 1960s - when FM stations were only simulcasting AM radio programs - I was a ""gofer"" for a local radio station in Central New Jersey. I helped run ""record hops"" (remember them?) and stage shows featuring the big rock and roll stars of the day. I was also a big fan of Philly (PA) radio (when there was a ""Top 100"", not just ""Top 40"" and the deejays were ""personalities"". These were my prime radio listening years and, if they were yours too, this is a ""must see"" documentary. Directors Chris Fox Gilson and Carolyn Travis really did a great job in finding some of the true legebnds of AM Radio's heyday (and a few from the later FM years) to interview.

Jerry Blavat (Philly), Dan Ingram (NY), Dick Biondi (Chicago) and Martha Dean (Detroit) are here as is ""Cousin Bruce"" Morrow, who was on WABC-AM in the 1960s and is still doing radio (on Sirrius XM) today. (BTW, Blavat - the ""Geator With The Heater""- still does this thing on WXPN in Philly on Saturday nights)

DJ's who had other later careers - Rufus Thomas (major soul hit artist) and Jay Thomas (TV actor) - are captured here. Yes, they use a lot of footage from the various Alan Freed movies from the late 1950s, but they also have rare clips of TV shows run by these DJs. Others interviewed include Pat Boone, Fabian, Casey Kasem and - separately - the members of Crosby, Stills and Nash.
The film ends in 2008 and so it doesn't (and couldn't) bring the story up to date with the explosion of Internet Radio, but it's still creatively done and I highly recommend it.

Okay, I have one gripe: No bonuses. Boy, I'd love to see some more of those rare 1960s TV clips that weren't used. But maybe there were royalty issues. The fabulous DVD/BD release of the documentary ""The Wrecking Crew"" has over 6 hours (!) of unused material and you can find my review of that on Amazon.) The good news, however, is that the Directors have set up a website  - www.theairplaychannel.com - to see more.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5025760,5,B006WPDKR2,"AIRPLAY brilliantly portrays America's post World War II music and cultural revolution, that forever pushed the boundaries of social, personal and innovative expression. Gilson and Travis use radio, and the emergence of rock and roll, to tell the larger story of a maturing baby boomer generation that, while on its way to create innovative music, found the time to confront war, racism. sexism and provinicialism. The story is lively, sobering and riveting, as it explores the convergence and impact of radio, technology and and or course ""the music"". It sheds a new and more personal look at the courage of DJ's who risked careers and well being, to promote a new music and cultural change. Revisiting the the role of the DJ, sheds new light, and gives due, to their historical importance. AIRPLAY also finds time to explore the often inherent tension between corporate profit and creativity. The DJ's, their families, friends and musicians serve as personal guides through this truly historic epoch. Like ""the 60's"" the narrative is chronicled in a thoughtful, insightful and, of course, playful way.
For those of us who were there, Travis and Gilson help us remember. And for those who weren't, this is a truly great, entertaining watch with serious historical significance.

It's all because of Clear Chanel I would have liked it if they would have talked more about how this mega corp has wrecked radio. It seems to me that the makers of this doc played it safe & talked very little about Clear Chanel & how they wrecked radio all over this country.
