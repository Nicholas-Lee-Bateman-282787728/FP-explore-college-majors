272445,5,6300216799,"Black Sunday is a prime example of great seventies movie making. Thomas Harris(Silence of the lambs, red dragon) gave John Frankenheimer a lot of meat Here, we are introduced to real characters. Who have real dilemmas.  Bruce Dern is haunting as Lander -- a pilot who is pushed(some by his own  doing) into insanity. Marthe Keller is wonderful as a terrorist who wants  to see the ""mission"" through. And Robert Shaw. Robert Shaw. Boy  do I miss him. Scenes where he is absolutely outstanding: questioning an  importer, asking a favor from another terrorist, and of course the ending.  Man I wish they would re-make this. But they would probably screw it up.  The aerial photography is some of the best put on celluloid. And John  Williams' score is awesome.

272446,4,6300216799,"John Frankenheimer is an excellent action director. In Black Sunday he directs a thrilling story of terrorists trying to blow up the Superbowl with a blimp full of lethal darts. Bruce Dern is great as the bitter blimp  pilot who throws his lot with Martha Keller, a Palistinian, who just barely  keeps Dern from cracking up. Robert Shaw is excellent as the Iraeli agent  tracking down the villians, from the first roots in the Middle East,  leading eventually to America, and terminating in a showdown at the  Superbowl. The action is good and the actors are well directed by  Frankenheimer, who of course did the immortal ""Manchurian  Candidate,"" and pilots this action film to a smashing climax. Even  after first seeing this movie, I am still haunted by Dern's sad portrait of  a broken man and the horrific experiment he performs on an unsuspecting man  of his exploding darts that make hamburger out of the man posing for what  he thinks is a strange camera. A good example of Frankenheimer's style and  art of direction.",960422400,31,1026,4.8

Some of our younger viewers my not understand the real impact of this film, and in doing so, will deny themselves the real enjoyment of a good film. True, there might be moments  in this film that would be considered shocking, but the purpose here it  quite simple, yet obvious. To show the lengths that some terrorists will go  to make their point, and the ingenious methods they can employ.

Make yourself a favor and  take the money for a better movie like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, or  Schindler's List, that are inteligent movies, and not cheap  propaganda.

I read where members of the Miami Dolphins played the Cowboys because they thought the Cowboys would win.  Oh well.  The story seems more like it could happen today with all the terrorists attacks.  But even at the time it was pretty intense.  The story is that terrorists hijack The Goodyear Blimp to bomb the Super Bowl.  The story is kind of drawn out. There are a few action scenes early in the movie.

272581,2,6300216799,"I was a big fan of this one in 1977 when I was 12 but time hasn't been particularly kind to Black Sunday.  One problem is that the politics haven't aged well.  The story concerns a plot by Black September (the group responsible for the Munich Olympics Massacre in 1972) to set off a sophisticated bomb delivered via the Goodyear Blimp at the Super Bowl--admittedly a clever hook for a thriller but this movie was produced for a different audience in a different era.

The politics of Black Sunday boil down to the Israelis are heroes and the Palestinians are terrorists.  There is lip service paid to a more nuanced political view--the reason behind the Palestinian grievance with Israel is at least mentioned and one character suggests that the female terrorist who is such a threat now was a creation of Israeli actions beginning when she was a small child.  The Mossad officer trying to stop the plot (Robert Shaw) even has a brief crisis of conscience where he wonders whether he really accomplished anything by killing all those Arabs during his long career but he overcomes that in plenty of time to play the hero and prevent what would have been the most damaging act of terrorism ever committed on American soil.  That's right-an Israeli agent of Mossad takes the lead in preventing terrorism on American soil rather than American intelligence or security forces.

Bruce Dern's crazy Viet Nam veteran seems more sympathetic today than the filmmakers intended in 1977.  Between the confession he was forced to read as a POW and the fact that he was tortured and held in captivity for years, to the Navy washing its hands of him despite his being a decorated war hero, to the shameful treatment he receives from the VA and the abandonment of his wife for someone without PTSD the fact that Dern's character turns against the United States now seems entirely understandable, although the plot to kill everyone at the Super Bowl is still a pretty big overreaction on his part.

Marthe Keller never impressed me much as an actress but she had a surprising run in Hollywood playing the exotic female lead in movies like Marathon Man, The Formula and The Amateur.  Still, casting her as a Palestinian with her thick German accent is a pretty big stretch even by lazy Hollywood standards.  Bruce Dern gives easily the film's best performance and probably its only serious one as the war hero turned terrorist.  Robert Shaw is a hammer as the Mossad agent trying to stop terrorism and anyone who gets in his way is a nail--he was a lot more fun in Jaws and The Sting.

The 1970's were not a good decade for director John Frankenheimer whose last strong movie was probably Seconds in 1966.  The 1970's saw him directing an unnecessary sequel to someone else's Best Picture Winner (French Connection II); a disastrous comedy (99 and 44/100% Dead) and a really bad horror movie (Prophecy).  Black Sunday feels generic and bloated, a studio-for-hire job with no personality or style.

Viewed today Black Sunday isn't very suspenseful or much fun--it certainly doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Marathon Man or Three Days of the Condor.  It is better than Two Minute Warning, another football stadium thriller that came out the year before, but that's a pretty low bar.  By today's standards Black Sunday feels like it's at least 30 minutes too long and the seemingly never-ending blimp sequence at the end owes more to the disaster movies of the period than was a good idea.

Black Sunday was based on the first novel by former journalist Thomas Harris who would end up creating something far more enduring with his next novel--Hannibal Lector in Red Dragon.  At this point Black Sunday barely even qualifies as a tiny blip on his legacy, but everyone has to start somewhere and the fact that his first novel got turned into a big budget movie probably didn't hurt his writing career.",1428105600,,3899,4.765230312035661

272607,3,6300216799,"Overall a pretty good action thriller with many similarities in style, story and mood to Day of the Jackal, just not quite as good. For me the best parts are the roughly first three-fourths of the film, dominated by Shaw and FBI colleagues who track down Keller and Dern. The last part of the film is a series of wild improbablilities and somewhat anti-climactic special effects, in other words very much along the lines of a James Bond movie. But one must admire the editing which is done for maximum impact and is quite effective. Solid work by principals but Fritz Weaver seems miscast as befuddled FBI agent. For me it just misses four stars, thus a strong three.",1419984000,,667,4.61344537815126

272611,4,6300216799,"Another great political thriller from the master director of the genre, John Frnakenheimer.  The Palestinean terrorist group Black September plans to attack the Super Bowl by crashing the Goodyear Blimp into the Orange Bowl. Black Sunday is certainly the better of the  football stadium attack movies (least much better than Two-Minute Warning from a year earlier). Frankenheimer got both Goodyear and the NFL to lend their products to the production. The realism goes so far as to include actual game footage between the  Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers using footage of Super Bowl X played in Miami's Orange Bowl.  The film was also 25 years ahead of its time during an era when terrorists where known for blowing up or hijacking planes rather than using  aircrafts as massive flying destructive weapons.

Robert Dern was the star of the cast as a psychotic ex-Vietnam aviator  seeking revenge on the country that he alleges deserted him. The scene where he goes off the rails explaining his plight to his Black September co-conspirator played by Marthe Keller was his best. Robert Shaw was also excellent as the Israeli intelligence officer who warns the Americans about the impneding attack. After all those roles were he played the villain, Shaw finally played the good guy.  Marthe Keller on the other hand was disappointing however, especially with her faux Middle Eastern accent.

Despite an underwhelming final two  minutes to the film, Black Sunday's had terrific performances and taut direction from director John Frankenheimer make for a riveting thriller that only degenerates in its climax.",1410134400,,1611,5.209302325581396

272653,3,6300216799,"When I was in high school -- not too long after this film was released -- I had a friend who had just moved from Africa who told me, ""Americans don't really care about terrorism because it never happens to them.""  At the time, I was skeptical.  But his words stuck with me over the years, and when the planes hit the twin towers, I thought back, and I realized that he was right.

But after 9/11, it seemed that we here in America had to hear about it over and over, at least on every anniversary.  And surely more than that.  Lucky for us, the pounding of the drums is starting to wane.  But it did bother me a lot when, only after Americans had been attacked on their own soil, did they make the following assertion:  ""The world has changed forever.""  Thinking back on my friend's words, I think that this assertion was totally invalid.  Why?  America had perhaps changed, but the rest of the world hadn't much at all, as many others around the globe have been dealing with terrorism for a much longer time than we, just like that friend told me about 35 years ago.

It's surprising that today (2014Mar25) is the first time that I've watched this film in its entirety; I have seen only bits and pieces in the past.  I'm sure that the average American viewing it today would have a different perspective than those back in 1977.  While watching I did think, ""Wow.  I'm sure there are easier ways to pull off a terrorist attack,"" as Bruce Dern and his sidekick come up with this overly-exotic-and-convoluted plan that's supposed to maximize impact.  At least for a movie audience, I suppose.

I did think of the film ""The Sum of All Fears"" (TSOAF) while watching, and it does seem that TSOAF ""borrowed"" from this one quite a bit.  That later film surely did seem a lot more realistic to me, however, as real-life terrorists in general seem to try to get, ahem, the most bang for the buck.  Why did the screenwriter choose to use darts here?  Didn't nuclear weapons exist back in 1977?  Well, of course they did; we know that since we used them way back during WWII.  But maybe the fake terrorists in this film didn't have a scientist working in the background so they had to use the next-next-next best thing?

I enjoyed a few unintended chuckles while watching ""Black Sunday.""  Without giving much away, there is a scene reminiscent of the terror that Jack Black endured in ""The Jackal"" is all that I will say.  And there is a scene where Mr. Dern goes into a long-winded-crying-like-a-baby speech where I was laughing out loud; a little too much melodrama there, kind of like watching some lame Oprah episode.  Finally, when a much younger Terry Bradshaw climbed off the bus to enter the Orange Bowl, I thought immediately of a real life quote from an opposing player at about that time, where that player said that Mr. Bradshaw ""was so dumb he couldn't spell 'CAT' if you spotted him the 'C' and the 'T'.""  Now that was a funny line!  Especially for a defensive lineman.

Well, perhaps this is a little too much of a US-centric film, as you'd expect standard Hollywood stuff to be, so I'm going with a 3.  Why not make this more global, and perhaps make the World Cup of Soccer -- truly the biggest sporting event in the world -- the target?  After all, wouldn't a film like that really draw more of an international audience?  Think of the DVD and Blu-ray sales!",1395705600,,3366,4.468852459016394

Despite the authorities closing in, Dalia continues with the scheme.  With the President scheduled to attend the game, complications force the terrorists to improvise, but they do so with deadly efficiency.

Besides featuring the Goodyear blimp, Black Sunday nicely works in scenes at the stadium, the TV control room, and real game footage from Super Bowl XX, which was played at the Orange Bowl.

For his disaster film BLACK SUNDAY, John Frankenheimer cameoed as a TV director.

In this sports-related picture based on Thomas Harris's novel (he wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SILENCE-OF-THE-LAMBS/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS</a>), the Super Bowl is target of a terrorist attack. The villain, a disgruntled Vietnam vet (Bruce Dern), secretes a massive dart gun on the GOODYEAR blimp with plans to set the device off as the craft floats above the game. An Israeli anti-terrorist expert (Robert Shaw) races against time to defeat this maniac.

It's a standard disaster film in which we meet a number of characters then wait to learn who among them will die. The problem is, at 2 hours and 13 minutes running time our answers come about a half hour too late.

272816,5,6300216799,"A steller cast and a riveting script from a book ahead of its time send this movie to the stratosphere! There can be no doubt in my mind that the presciece of this movie went over the head of most Americans in 1977. Indeed, even in the 1980s as Americans increasingly became the targets of terrorists, people felt aloof to the true threat that existed.

Seeing this movie made me realize how porus America's borders truly were. Indeed, even now the borders can be overcome (Although Admitedly It Is Much Harder). Bruce Dern's portrayal of a disgruntled Vietnam vet is the performance of his career. He and Marthe Keller are the perfect antagonists. Yet at the same time, they are not caricatures. Keller also plays a wounded women in the psyche. ""Take a good look at her. You created her,"" Gotell says to Shaw's character as he hands him her dossier. The horrors that Keller's character went through manufactured her into a monster. Sadly that is often the case in internecine strife, yet while deplorable it is understandable. It is why there will never be peace in the Middle-East.

The pacing and timing of this movie are phenomenal. It also shows that America would be fine without a DHS. The ATF, CIA, DEA, FBI, INS, NSA, Customs and all four branches of the armed forces will always be enough to strangle the terror threat facing the Americans.

This movie is one of Frankenheimer's best. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. I wish he was still with us to make more remarkable films of this genre.

272817,5,6300216799,"Before 911 this movie seemed so far-fetched and outrageous that no one even remotely took it seriously.  Not so anymore.  These days the government is hiring hollywood writers for their creative input, nothing is off the board and everything is considered, no matter how crazy it may sound.  I read they even make these writers sign secrecy agreements not to disclose the ideas discussed.

These days many movie scripts and book proposals get buried if the ideas presented get too creative.  Paladin Press for example, was sued and lost a huge lawsuit after someone bought their book 'Hit Man' by Rex Feral, fancied himself a professional killer and promptly murdered three people.  It seems you cannot print anything you want, not anymore.  BTW, it came out at the trial that the author was actually a woman from Florida.

Movies like Black Sunday, Two Minute Warning, Day of the Jackal, The Kidnapping of the President, etc. are actually used as training films in law enforcement academies and three-lettered agencies.

I don't believe Black Sunday would be made today, not in our litigious society.

Bruce Dern who plays the terrorist in this movie said in an interview that he would never make this movie today because""...somebody might really be able to do that.""",1328918400,2,1268,4.966824644549763

Considering that it's written by Thomas Harris, the author of ""Silence Of the Lambs"" & ""Red Dragon"", that's high recommendation enough.  The late Robert Shaw is terrific as the Mousad agent assigned to track down the Black September terrorists and Bruce Dern is outstanding in a role that would stereotype him for a while as a crazed, suicidal Vietnam veteran.  Marthe Keller is sexy and seductive as the Palestinean terrorist who seduces Dern into performing the suicidal mission.  When you compare this '70s film to the paucity of quality thrillers nowadays , you realize that Frankenheimer, given good material like this and ""Manchurian Candidate"", ""Seven Days In May""--could deliver. Ignore the hillbilly's ignoramus review and check this one out--I doubt very seriously that this clown ever read a book!!",1326240000,,964,5.1210191082802545
272819,4,6300216799,"A classic right out of the gate for me when I watched this in the early days of Home Box Office!! Frankenheimer has always been a favorite of mine in that he was never afraid to tackle very controversial political subject matter in many of his films and with magnificent style to boot; see ""Manchurian Candidate"" for the penultimate example! The cast across the board were terrific with a truly psychotic turn by Bruce Dern who ALWAYS played the ""walking unhinged"" with such subtlety while never 'commenting' on the character! Shaw, in a rare turn as a good guy, would always find a way to be somewhat menacing even as the protagonist. Sadly, this would turn out to be one of his final roles...this film seemed to dissapear almost overnight in the wake of 9/11 and I suppose for the sake of being respectful, appropriately so! This isn't an easy film. The viewer, ever aware of the impending doom, is sucked into the undertow of chaos right up until the climax! Between the tragic events of the '72 Munich games & most recently, the World Trade center attacks, this movie for me personifies a true fear & vulnerability we can all relate to! This is a MUST SEE, without a doubt!!",1315353600,,1178,4.587677725118484
272820,5,6300216799,"Still the greatest film made about international terrorism ever made, Black Sunday has an immediacy, an urgency throughout that lets us know the CIA, FBI and Isrealis are working against the clock to find the terrorist cel and intercept what might be happening on American soil. Bruce Dern gave the finest performance of his career as Viet Nam vet Michael J. Lander, coerced into working for the terrorists when they convince him America has failed him and Robert Shaw is superb as Kabokov the Isreali agent looking for him. Dern's breakdown scene when he thinks the mission is cancelled is both heartbreaking and terrifying because we see the first time the magnitude of his rage and madness. Marthe Keller, who had a pretty good run in the seventies is sort of a latter day Joan of Arc gone made in her performance as Ilsa, more than willing to use her body and give of her mind for the cause. Tautly directed by John Frankenheimer, the film has a realism that is gritty and strojng, often looking like a documentary. The chase sequence through Miami is extraordinary.

- The  Jimmy Carter lookalike. It was a silly likeness.

- Robert Shaw walking across the football field with some men before the SB game asked ""What's this blimp for?"" and one man tagging along piped: ""It takes pictures for television."" For some reason that prompted laughs.

- Robert Shaw running down the steps of the stadium. He looked like a Keystone Cop. It took so long for him to get down.

- When that other blimp pilot, Farley, said: ""I can sure as hell try!"" in that whimsical Southern accent.

- At the very end when the helicopter flew away with Robert Shaw clinging to the cable line attached to it. The chopper turned and Robert Shaw made a really wide swing.

The main credits appear in the original aspect ratio, then the movie shifts to a cropped 16:9 (1.78:1) version designed to fit HD TVs.  The original aspect ratio of film is anamorphic Panavision(2.35:1)

Viewers of modern movies will be surprised at the tone of this film, which is possibly the last of the gritty 70's style of thrillers (this was released the same year as Star Wars, which changed everything). Instead of the implacable, unstoppable cartoon villains who populate modern thrillers, we have two complex, not entirely unsympathetic villains obsessed with performing an act of unspeakable horror, both driven by personal demons and the unfair treatment of those they seek to punish.  Constantly faced with failure and setbacks, you may find yourself actually pulling for them at times.

Likewise, the heroes are not entirely without blemish.  Shaw's character is consumed with self-doubt because, as his young partner tells him, he has ""come to see both sides of the [Palestinian] question.  And that is never good.""  Frankenheimer was accused by one jewish newspaper of being 'Hitlerite' for his neutral treatment of the politics.

Three star rating is due to the poor special effects that blunt the impact of the finale, but it is a suspenseful ride until the last few shots.  John Williams' amazing soundtrack is at long last available on CD from Screen Archives and can be purchased through Amazon for a lower shipping cost than a direct purchase from the vendor.

Another treat of this movie is to see downtown Miami and a run-down South Beach in the late 1970s and compare it with how both appear today in productions like Burn Notice.  As for continuity errors, how about the San Gabriel Mountains and (then) 11 Freeway in the background as the blimp takes off in ""Miami""",1265414400,6,1920,5.00314465408805

272865,4,6300216799,"Director John Frankenheimer is most well-known for some of his suspsense thrillers he made, including The Manchurian Candidate and Seven Days in May, but Black Sunday has somehow escaped the spotlight. In late 1975, Mossad agent David Kabakov leads an assault on a terrorist compound of Black September and uncovers evidence that the group is planning an attack somewhere in the U.S. soon after the New Year.  Kabakov teams up with the FBI to try and uncover and prevent the plot and soon founds out the intended target, Super Bowl X in Miami where 80,000 fans will be at risk.  But Kabakov doesn't know how the attack will hit so he can he stop the attack in time?  Frankenheimer filmed many scenes at the actual Super Bowl in the Orange Bowl as the Cowboys and Steelers duked it out which adds a really cool sense of reality to the movie.  As a thriller, this movie really works as the tension rises as Kabakov draws nearer while the terrorists get ready for their attack.  With a good score by John Williams, this is an excellent if not hugely well-known thriller from the 70s so give it a try!

  In a career that had him play a huge variety of different characters, a shark hunter, a Bond villian, Gen. Custer, Robert Shaw adds another unique role to his list as Mossad agent David Kabakov, a veteran of 30 years who's burned out but gets a jolt early in the movie that sparks his emotions again as he hunts down the members of Black September.  Bruce Dern gives a great performance as Michael Lander, an unhinged Vietnam vet who holds much resentment for the US because of his treatment following his release from the Viet Cong after six years in captivity.  His feelings make him an easy target for the terrorists to manipulate him into helping use the Goodyear blimp and a specialized explosive to attack the Super Bow. Marthe Keller is chilling as Dahlia, a Black September member who more or less is Lander's keeper as she orchestrates the attack.  In a small role, Bekim Fehmiu plays Fasil, the determined Black September leader.  Also in the cast is Fritz Weaver as Corley, an FBI agent working with Kabakov, and Steven Keats as Robert Moskevsky, Kabakov's long-time partner.

A film shows a captured POW making a speech. These terrorists are planning to attack America in January. But another group of counter-terrorists are planning an attack that succeeds. Two escape this destruction. Then we see a football game. A blimp flies overhead for television cameras; high winds affect it. A tape with threats has been captured. Federal agents are warned about this plan. They will search for this woman. But she has already arrived in America. We learn about Captain Landers' past. There is a speed boat chase in Long Beach harbor.

Federal officials investigate the ship and its captain; little is learned. Then the captain gets a telephone call. There are no clues. There is drama in the hospital. Was it secure? The terrorists test their device in a deserted area. They hope to kill 80,000 people! The Israeli agent gets help from an unexpected source to identify the woman. Dalia refuses to leave for her safety. She is located in Miami and they go to arrest her. There is a chase and a running gun battle (for viewer interest?). There is an unexpected glitch in the plans. Landers gets to show his acting ability in a dramatic speech. Dalia shows her talents as an agent who makes things happen.

The day of the Super Bowl arrives. The security agents will search the stadium for explosives. It will be as secure as possible. [Can they plan for the unexpected?] The blimp takes off to provide overhead television coverage as usual. The game begins. Security forces watch over the crowd. Then there is a break in the case. We see the trick that will be used to arm the blimp. Will the Federal agents be able to stop them in time to prevent the slaughter of 80,000 people and the President? We know a film must have a happy ending to be successful; there's no surprise here.

It is interesting to see those old automobiles, styles, and attitudes from the past. The idea of a terrorist attack upon America must have seemed far-fetched then. This film is mostly fast paced after the beginning, which tells us about the people in this drama. The style of this film seems European in outlook.

272870,5,6300216799,"When will there be another actor like Robert Shaw?

Probably never. But in ""Black Sunday"" he comes back to life with a vengeance.

The transfer on DVD is acceptable, although not to be compared with the recent transfer of another movie in which Shaw appeared. I am talking of ""A Man For All Seasons"".

The sound too is not too bad, although I cannot help wondering whether or not they used the same copy they used for the LaserDisc release of some years back.

In this day and age of terrorism pervading all the news channels, this film is an eery reminder, that sometimes terrorists do not need to be foreigners to accomplish their terrible acts.

So many times, although they claim to be religiously motivated, they don't even believe it themselves. They are just well oiled killing machines, with brainwashed minds whi tend to aggregate to feel a kind of belonging, a certain togetherness.

Alone, they are just pathetic and little insecure things, not even being sure whether they are still alive or not. Yet, if triggered the right way, these tiny beings can cause more damage than a battle tank.

""Black Sunday"" was filmed still during the Vietnam War, hence the many references to that war. But there is an omnipresent component, and that component is the Palestinian/Israeli war.

The three main characters are:

Robert Shaw playing an Israeli Mossad agent, out to prevent a terrorist act performed in the United States during the Super Bowl;

Marthe Keller, a Swiss German actress, also known for her role together with George C. Scott in ""The Formula"", plays a Palestinian born terrorist, tasked to convince an American, former fighter pilot, turned to blimp pilot, to help her out in the plan to ""carry"" a special ""cluster bomb"" on board of the Goodyear blimp;

Bruce Dern is the disgruntled pilot who, after a traumatic experience with Vietnamese prisons, and not feeling appropriately considered or rewarded by the U.S. Government, decides, partly out for love for Marthe Keller's character, and partly as a kind of revenge, to carry out this folly.

Besides the three mentioned we get also Fritz Weaver (Demon Seed) and Walter Gotell (of James Bond memory, as General Gogol and as the SPECTRE agent in ""From Russia with Love"") to support this complicated and highly suspenseful picture.

Perhaps certain themes may be a bit outdated, but if one turns the names and places a bit around, you could find yourself confronted with a very modern and still actual picture.

This is a picture that has survived the years almost intact.

What is rather shocking is the awareness, that certain realities, dealt in this work of fiction, are still among us nowadays.

Moreover, this is one of those movies that foresaw, in one way or another, the happenings that would later become reality on 9/11.

Some movies simply are eerily closer to reality than one might think or wish them to be.

The acting by all is impeccable and very believable. The story grips you and never allows you to truly relax.

But be warned. This is a very uncomfortable movie to watch, especially for the reasons I have exposed above, but it also has the advantage to explain some facts behind those, otherwise so obscure worlds of terrorism and secret agencies.

I can only recommend it to a mature audience. This is no ""kiddies"" movie. To minors, this can still be a too shocking and pitiless depiction of fanatism and its consequences.",1176940800,2,3415,4.825042881646655

272872,5,6300216799,"This prescient thriller has won new respect since 9/11, but the film was quite popular when it was originally released. The film has many things to recommend it. In addition to the NFL and special effects eye-candy, there is the ironic scene where a terrorist flees to a Miami beach and is 'driven into the sea' by the pursuing authorities.

But I think the main reason for the film's popularity is the way that Kabakov and Dahlia interact. Bruce Dern's Lander is spectacularly overdone. Most of his histrionics would have been unnecessary, if he'd simply sent his ex and her new hubby tickets to the Superbowl, as Lander did in the book.

The story's main attraction has to be the peculiar love-hate relationship between Dahlia and Kabakov.

Kabakov spares Dahlia's life in the Beirut attack. While he disparages the 'naive' Americans, Kabakov's act of mercy shows his own growing disenchantment with a lifetime of war. He takes comfort in the thought that, after the battle deaths of his sons, he still has ""a daughter who lives in Jerusalem, Israel,"" but this is no longer enough to silence his doubts.

In Miami, Dahlia inexplicably risks everything in the attempt to reach Kabakov in the hospital. This attack makes little sense for someone seeking to avoid the attention of the authorities, but by now Dahlia clearly has some growing doubts of her own. Something about this particular enemy, Kabakov, threatens her personally.

The anarchy of Black September leaves Dahlia no reason to expect that a Palestinian state will be anything better. Up until Beirut, she'd been able to put those doubts aside in the interest of the cause, but Kabakov's unexpected mercy has changed all that.

In the movie's climactic scene, Dahlia and Kabakov face off once again. This time, Dahlia hesitates and Kabakov doesn't. The conflict seems to have been resolved. But ""Black Sunday"" shows us that human conflicts are rarely as simple as governments and causes would have us believe.",1164412800,,1973,4.963636363636364

The movie also has a special place in my heart because when I was 7 years old my father worked a management position at the Miami Orange Bowl and allowed me and my brother to watch the filming of the stadium scenes of the movie involving the Good Year Blimp over the field and the crowd in the stadium freaking out and running for their lives. I remember when the stadium freak-out scene was being shot the extra's were on the field and the director said ""action"" and everyone went running and screaming from the blimp prop and then one of the extra's (an old lady) ruined one of the shots by saying ""oooooh"" and picking up a quarter she found on the feild, lol . But any how , If your into good terrorist movies and 70's cinematography, you'll enjoy this creative movie that involves a plot to savatage a Super Bowl game with a terrorist act of flying a blimp over the stadium field and igniting a contraption beneath the blimp that shoots out thousands of fragments that would shread the croud to peices and the football players!

The lunatic Vietnam war veteran portrayed by Bruce Dern conveys the distorted impression that a high number of our military personnel returned home with serious mental illnesses.  Robert Shaw's character, the Israeli secret agent/assassin, is insultingly told by an American operative that Israel created terrorists like the Palestinian woman (Marthe Keller) enraged by the alleged mistreatment of her family by the state of Israel.  He is also somewhat guilt tripped by his past violent activities which supposedly only perpetuate the never ending violence.  Such moral equivalency outrageously ignores the fact that Israel is a democratic society victimized by racist and self pitying Arab murderers.  This noble country's virtues far outweigh its occasional failings.

Does Black Sunday have any redeeming value?  Yes, this is a fast paced action story which is good enough to justify a few hours of your time.  It's also interesting to watch a film regarding terrorist activity against the United States almost a quarter of a century before 9/11.  At that time, we mistakenly thought that the more secular PLO types posed the greater danger.  The Islamic jihadists barely registered on our radar screen.

That said, this film is a rousing thriller that holds up remarkably well.  The story, about a plot by Palestinian terrorists who plan a terrorist attack on the Super Bowl will have you on the edge of your seat.  John Frankenheimer directs this film assuredly, maybe a notch below his other classic thriller, ""The Manchurian Candidate"".  Robert Shaw is excellent as the Israeli officer who is trying to unearth the terrorist plot before it is launched.  Bruce Dern, as the disillusioned unhinged Goodyear blimp pilot who is the pawn of the PLO is most effective, probably too much so.  It's roles like these that typecast him in psycho roles throughout his career.  Marthe Keller, the German Julia Ormond of the 1970's, doesn't fare as well.  I think she was trying to tackle her command of the English language before she tried to effectively play a Palestinian terrorist.

272950,4,6300216799,"For years the 1977 film ""Black Sunday"" was seen as being prophetic with regards to Super Bowl Sunday becoming a national obsession. But twenty-five years later it is the element of the terrorist attack that is seen as being prescient. If anything the story of this film is more powerful today, even if the special effects are less than special, even by the standard of the times.
The story is based on the novel by Thomas Harris, his first work, now note worthy because it is the author's only work not involving Hannibal Lecter. Mike Lander (Bruce Dern) is a psychotic Vietnam vet who spent six years being tortured as a POW and who now joins up with Dahlia Iyad (Marthe Keller), a member of the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September in a plan to detonate a bomb at the Super Bowl. If for some reason you have never seen the film the poster art of a dirigible appearing over the top of the football stadium gives away how they plan to accomplish this task. Because a Palestinian is involved the person trying to stop the plot is Israeli agent David Kabokov (Robert Shaw), who knows full well the dangers of trying to stop people who are willing to die to accomplish their goal. He is also a man tired of living in a world where nothing ever changes and all the deaths he has seen and caused mean nothing.
The hero and villain are men twisted by their lives in different directions and it is these characters that try to make ""Black Sunday"" more than thriller and it is their personal conflict that helps to sustain the film when we get to the big finish and things go a bit over the top. But up to that point it is a pretty solid thriller. The film is directed by John Frankenheimer, who already had life imitate art with ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" which was shelved for decades following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Frankenheimer was pretty good at establishing tension and milking the dramatic moments of the film. The music is by John Williams, two years after ""Jaws"" at that point in his distinguished career.
The game being played in the film is Superbowl X, where the Pittsburgh Steeler beat the Dallas Cowboys 21-17 (the blimp scene was filmed at the Orange Bowl the day before the game). One special treat of this film is that ""The Star Spangled Banner"" before the game was sung by Tom Sullivan (accompanied by Up With People), and whose memorable final high note is preserved for posterity. Appearing as themselves in the film are broadcasters Pat Summerall and Tommy Brookshier, and you will recognize Terry Bradshaw and some other players from both teams.

Robert Shaw plays Kabakov, an Israeli operative tracking a dangerous Palestinian terrorist named Dahlia to the United States after recovering a tape recording intended for use after a terrorist attack on American soil.  With help from Sam Corley (Fritz Weaver) of the FBI, he begins a race against time to stop the attack before it can be unleashed on the unsuspecting American public.  Meanwhile, Dahlia (Marthe Keller) along with disgruntled Vietnam Vet Michael Lander (Bruce Dern) works to create a device that could cause the worst massacre on American soil since Pearl Harbor.

About the Movie:
Black Sunday is one of those movies you see shown on independent TV stations on Sunday afternoon.  It's a surprisingly complex movie, but one that is deeply flawed in a few vital spots, causing it to be relegated to the budget DVD section.

All that said, there's a lot going for it. John Williams wrote the musical score for Black Sunday, and like most of his work, it is excellent, providing much of the intense tension a viewer will feel while watching this movie.  It also proves that not all of his compositions sound like Star Wars.

Directed by the legendary John Frankenheimer, Black Sunday shows much of his talent in constructing a compelling film.  At the time of release, the plot undoubtedly seemed far fetched, but now, after September 11, 2001 it almost seems plausible and has gained new relevance that makes it worth watching.

In some ways, this is a deeply psychological movie.  The two main characters, Kabakov and Michael Lander are both deeply flawed characters, pushed by events into the actions they take, and the movie attempts to analyze them in some depth.  It's almost more about the characters than the action, which is refreshing for an action movie.

Acting is truly what gives this film so much potential. Robert Shaw plays the lead character of Kabakov, a Isreali intelligence officer out to stop a terrorist attack, with a quiet dignity that is entirely convincing. Bruce Dern, who plays opposite Shaw, in the character of Michael Lander, a deranged Vietnam vet, shines in this movie.  Dern portrays Lander so convincingly and with such passion that although he's clearly damaged, you cannot help but almost cheer for him to succeed in his nefarious plans.  It's unfortunate that this role seems to have helped to typecast Dern into similar roles.

Together, both actors, along with some spectacular visual sequences with the Goodyear Blimp create a story that while a little overplayed at times, is both entertaining and thought provoking. It has some minor flaws with story and continuity, and of course, like many action films of the pre-MTV era (we had longer attention spans then), it drags a little at times. In addition, the box cover and poster art this film was release acts as a bit of a spoiler for the movie. What inspired the film's producers to give away the climax of the film on the poster art is beyond me.

In the end, however, a major flaw does the most damage to this film.  Undoubtedly, this flaw accounts for why this movie is relatively unknown.  It's not the acting or story that hurt its longevity, it's the visual effects.  It's unfortunate that director Frankenheimer is no longer with us, or we might have seen a future director's cut with this problem resolved.

The issue in question is two climactic explosions at the end of the film.  Running short on time and money during production, the planned visual effects fell through, and the producers were forced to cut in animated explosions instead of more sophisticated effects. What resulted was a pair of split second campy, extremely cartoonish explosions that end up wasting the entire build up to movie's climax and turn it into something completely anti-climactic.  It's a true shame, because if done right, this movie could have a lot more impact than it ends up having.

That said, if you're willing to overlook this problem, this is definitely one to watch, especially if you like deeper more psychological type films than basic shoot-em-ups.

About the DVD
Black Sunday comes in a plastic hard case on a single sided in Widescreen format with Dolby Digital 5.1 or restored mono sound.  It is translated into French and has available, English subtitles.

The original audio track for this movie was mono, so while the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack makes the music sound bolder, it does little to improve the soundtrack elsewhere.  Neither are fantastic, though John William's musical score is delightfully powerful in the Dolby format.

Picture quality is decent, though the film grain is fairly obvious and the typical nicks and scratches you see in such films are there as well.

This release has no special features whatsoever, marking it as an extremely basic DVD release.

Bottom Line:
A fun, if flawed movie on a very basic release.  4 stars.",1080086400,4,4871,4.918092909535452

Robert Shaw (in his last major performance) plays the Israeli agent Kabakov with a convincing strength, despite his disconcerting Welsh accent.
Bruce Dern plays a deranged Vietnam vet (a role which led to a career of typecasting) who decides to destroy the Super Bowl by rigging the obligatory blimp with explosives and detonating it above the game. He is helped in this mad plan by Palestinian terrorist Dahlia Iyad (Marthe Keller), who turns in a fine performance.
The film seems slow-moving now, compared to the pace of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, but for 1974, it was absolutely breathless. The plot, once considered impossible, is too much of a probability now.

Director John Frankenheimer excelled at this type of thriller (he also directed THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and RONIN), and BLACK SUNDAY is one of his later entries in this genre.
After a somehwhat slow start, BLACK SUNDAY turns into a real nail-biter of an international thriller, shot with a kind of mid-70s documentary style. The film is actually much tenser today than it was in 1977 because of the unfortunate way that terrorism has become a day to day concern in America; it is all too easy to imagine terrorists hatching a plot similiar to the one used here. Irish actor Robert Shaw, fresh from JAWS, would seem to be an odd choice to play an Israeli government agent, but he attacks the part with tight-jawed, unflappable conviction; I certainly would pick him to lead a counter-terrorism operation. The last 40-minutes are one prolonged agony of suspense (shot at the actual Superbowl X) marred only by some clumsy special effects at the very end. The only real flaw in the film is Bruce Dern's occasional over-the-top performance.

His methods were extremely direct and effective -- he simply eliminated terrorists wherever he encountered them (except during a moment of weakness, when he came upon Marthe in the shower, at the first of the film, which proved to be a costly mistake).  Shaw's character acted in a totally unilateral fashion, never halting to form a coalition or obtain United Nations approval.  He never whined, ""Why do they hate us?""  He did not reach out to the terrorists with a friendly hand bearing tolerance, inclusion, diversity or compassion.  His intent was to protect people from being attacked by terrorists, and he knew that the only way to do that is to kill them first -- he knew that NOTHING else works, against terrorists determined to kill you.

""I just don't picture a bunch of terrorists being able to come over to the US and get away with anything"" the person said.  Time has shown us how right director John Frankenheimer's film ""Black Sunday"" was, and that we truly lived in a ""sleeping America"".
From the almost documentary-like opening title sequence, devoid of music and replete with the sounds of a foreign land, this suspense epic builds slowly and with unique conviction. The terrorists are all played realistically and no one  goes overboard into the realm of ham. Shaw is gritty and and steel-eyed as he works against the clock to stop the plot.
Bruce Dern plays an ex-Vietnam helicopter vet hired by the terrorists to aid them in their plot to explode a uniquely devasting bomb at the Super Bowl. He is at his psychotic best, and one scene, late in the film, is particularly intense as we watch him break down before the camera and reveal just how deeply distrubed he truly is.
The score by John Williams is one of his best, using a simple 8 note motif that is introduced early in the film with piano and flute, and by the film's climax, is heard in thudering orchestral glory.
This is suspense thriller with a brain, so don't expect wild action from scene one. It builds slowly, with sporadic action scenes interspersed, as it aims toward it's climx at the big game.
Ironically, the film's achilles heel are it's special effects near the film's end. Cinematographer John Alonzo was alowed to handle the effects shots and later, the director had to redo most of them at the last minute. The result is that by today's standards, the film falls short of being totally convincing in several scenes.
Nevertheless, the editing is wonderful, the score huge, the acting great, and the story intriguing. It more than makes up for a few of those shots.

The strength of the movie is that its characters force you to see the situation from all points of view. In the end, you root for Shaw's character to stop the attrocity from taking place, but such is the ingenuity and determination from Dern and Keller that you wonder, can they actually pull it off? The chase scene with the blimp and the helicopter will have you on the edge of what's left of your seat.
Soon to be released on dvd? I would love to see it happen, but with the current situation and uncertainty about how it would be received I highly doubt it. A remastered widescreen version on tape.....now that might be something worth having.",1045785600,3,1690,4.617940199335548
273020,4,6300216799,"I agree with others that this is a timely film, reaching beyond the era it was made. It's a much more realistic scenario than the fantasy Jack Ryan disappointment, The Sum of All Fears. Did anyone else shake their heads at why Hollywood decided to change the villains from the Tom Clancy novel, making them into easily-hated neo-Nazis? An attempt at political correctness, perhaps, a soothing of ruffled feathers, an attempt to downplay the reality of Arab terrorism.
This film deals with the reality, folks. There is still Palestinian hatred for the U.S. Anyone forget the dancing in Palestinian streets on 9/11? Arab sympathy for the Palestinians, real or a pretext, is part of what fuels groups like Al Quaeda. Resentment over U.S. support for Israel is a big reason for targeting the U.S.
That aside, the script, acting and action sequences in this movie are all excellent. It never loses its dramatic tension. Robert Shaw is great as the counter-terrorism expert on the tail of the PLO-types. Bruce Dern is brilliant as the insane Vietnam Vet driven to support a destructive cause because of his own pain.",1045008000,12,1110,4.909574468085107
273021,5,6300216799,"Thought it is unusually long, at close to 143 minutes, BLACK SUNDAY is an incredible example of suspense at its finest.  This is because there is a master in the director's chair, John Frankenheimer.  He managed to get his hands on a great story back in 1976 that, approaching the film's 25th anniversary of release, has taken on an added significance in the wake of September 11, 2001.
Breaking it all down to its prime components, BLACK SUNDAY involves a dastardly plot conceived by an unhinged Vietnam vet (Bruce Dern) and a member (Marthe Keller) of the infamous Black September terrorist organization to turn the Super Bowl into ""a kill zone for 80,000 people"" (as Dern describes it), and the efforts of an Israeli agent (Robert Shaw) and FBI agent (Fritz Weaver) to stop them.  Frankenheimer, however, weaves a lot of different strands together and wraps it all up with a superbly mounted aerial chase between the two pairs of protagonists in the skies over Miami that involves a hijacked Goodyear blimp loaded with a quarter million rifle darts.
Shaw manages to disable the blimp as it heads towards Miami's Orange Bowl, site of the Super Bowl; but the blimp continues on and soon plunges right into the packed stadium.  This scene must rank as one of the most frightening in the cinema ever.
Shaw and Weaver are well-matched against Dern and Keller, and the excellent, almost Brucknerian, score by John Williams is nearly as brilliant as the one he composed for Spielberg's JAWS.  As a prelude to DIE HARD, THE SIEGE, and SPEED, BLACK SUNDAY is an absolute must-see!",1001635200,4,1574,4.814814814814815
273022,4,6300216799,"I saw John Frankenheimer's ""Black Sunday"" when I was a big fan of Bruce Dern.  ""Black Sunday"" is Frankenheimer's last memorable movie.
Palestinian terrorist Marthe Keller conspires with mentally ill Vietnam veteran Bruce Dern in a plot to detonate a dart-firing blimp over the Super Bowl.  Israeli agent Robert Shaw is out to stop them.
""Black Sunday"" is John Frankenheimer's last unforgettable movie.  Although not up to Frankheimer's previous masterpieces(""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Seven Days In May,"" and ""Birdman Of Alcatraz""), ""Black Sunday"" is still an intelligent and thrilling action movie.  The movie features great performances from two of cinema's more underrated actors: Robert Shaw and Bruce Dern.  Robert Shaw is great as Kabakov.  I'm only sorry that Shaw never became a superstar and that he died at such a fairly young age.  Bruce Dern gives the greatest performance of his career.  He steals the show as the angry and confused Michael Lander.  Dern takes a villain like Lander and almost has viewers rooting for him.  I'm also sorry that Dern's talents haven't been put to better use in recent years.  The last several minutes of the film are breathtaking.  ""Black Sunday"" is exciting from start to finish.  The film is far more entertaining than any of the action movies of today.
Like Brian DePalma, John Frankenheimer is a once magnificent director who forgot how to make great movies.  After the 1960s, Frankenheimer hasn't made one genuine masterpiece.  His recent film ""Ronin"" is just another plastic Hollywood action movie and doesn't come close to being even as good as ""Black Sunday.""
""Black Sunday"" is well-recommended.  This film is for fans of John Frankenheimer, Robert Shaw, and Bruce Dern, as well as anyone who loves action movies.",996364800,5,1768,5.150877192982456
273023,5,6300216799,"This movie needs to be on DVD.Not only is it a great action movie with some of the most breathtaking aerial photography ever filmed, but it is one of Director John Frankenheimer's best films (Remember Manchurian Candidate? Seconds? The Train?).

Unfortunately, John Frankenheimer has directed a stream of bad movies, like Reindeer Games, The General's Daughter,recently, so true Frankenheimer fans must go back to his past great films to get their fix.

My question is, where is the DVD of this great film? And what about Seconds? Are the studios listening?

If you can't wait for the DVD, then buy the video and watch it 3 or 4 times. The movie is that good. From the writer of Silence of the Lambs.

*Postscript* Well, it seems the studios have wised up. Black Sunday is finally available on DVD, as is Seconds. Now go out and buy these classic movies.",991785600,,854,4.7114093959731544
273024,5,6300216799,"Adapted from the superlative Thomas Harris book, ""Black Sunday"" is one thriller that delivers a thought-provoking punch as big as the Goodyear blimp.  The premise of terrorists absconding with the aforementioned ""ship"" in order to wipe out thousands of Super Bowl patrons is timely.
With the respective bombings of the New York's World Trade Center and the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Americans are becoming aware of the threat posed by our country's enemies.
  The film hits home with dynamic performances by stars Robert Shaw, the always-super Bruce Dern, and Marthe Keller as one tough and determined anarchist.
  As of yet, the film's images are fictional; hopefully, they will not come to pass.",986688000,4,706,5.212389380530974
273025,3,6300216799,"Bruce Dern at his unhinged psychotic best as a vietinam vet who takes part in a insane plot with palestian terroists to murder 80,000 innocent people during the super bowl. Robert Shaw plays David Kabokov, an isreail commando out to foil the plot. Dern`s killer smile and outright dangerous mind is very memorable especally in one scene where he kills an innocent man while testing his bomb which is compiled of 120,000 lethal darts he plans to use during the super bowl. The only flaw in the film i saw was the editing, if the producers would of shortend the film`s length about twenty minutes or so it would of not been so prolonging. But this film certainley ranks high up there with other terroirst films. And Robert Shaw`s performance here outmatches his hideous performence in `Jaws`",971136000,2,789,4.766423357664234

There ARE no Palestinian terrorists, only people with not even a shred of an armed forces trying to defend themselves against the endless criminal aggressions committed against them by Israel---constant violation of international law with its illegal occupation, and the massacring of those they are stealing from, keeping the ones left alive in the largest open air prison on earth.  Yeah, many of them hate us and some of the more radical want to kill us.  Why?  Because we have allowed Zionist trash to infiltrate all branches of our government and use the United States might as Israel's own huge stick to beat up the world with.  Meanwhile, the suffering US taxpayers are forced to fund all of it and what do we get in return?  Full body scans at airports with an out of control TSA, continued erosion of rights as US citizens, all in the name of ""protecting"" us, and a militarized police force that will show up at your house with armored vehicles after you've had a disagreement with your neighbor.",1484265600,,1035,4.722222222222222
