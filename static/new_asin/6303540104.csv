Not a very good movie at all but Rebecca DeMornay looks her best in this movie. Also, she has one of the best sex scenes EVER early in this movie. That sex scene alone makes this movie worth it.",1229731200,6,354,6.695652173913044
679684,4,6303540104,This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s.  Rebecca DeMornay is hot in this remake of the Roger Vadim 50s classic.,1175731200,3,119,4.173913043478261
679685,4,6303540104,"This movie isn't particularly good--it's a basic marriage of convenience and cheating tupperware party.  It's still got great, funny moments even if it doesn't always make sense, but I wouldn't thumb my nose at it.  I never saw the original nor, until looking up these reviews, did I even know there was one.  Rebecca DeMornay is always beautiful, and her performance is actually quite hilarious in places.  The situations are outrageous, and Vincent Spano is nice eye candy if not much else.  Donovan Leitch's son also turns in a solid supporting role performance.

Sure, this movie is shallow, silly, raunchy, and totally 80s, but that's what makes it so much fun.  A great guilty pleasure with a decent music sountrack, 80s movie buffs should really like this one, because it fits all the typical criteria.",1154563200,,809,4.948148148148148
679686,1,6303540104,"This is one of those laughably bad movies where you find yourself wondering how much worse it can get, and then it gets worse. Rebecca DeMornay does her best to summon a this-is-how-twenty-and-thirty-something-guys-think-a-sexy-wild-chick-looks-when-she's-having-sex persona, but really, she doesn't bring one iota of sensuality to the character. For a movie that's supposed to be all about sex, overall it's curiously un-sexy. There is one reason, and one reason only to sit through (the unrated version of) this movie -- Frank Langella. On the pool table. In the hot tub. On the floor. The only true depiction of desire and passion in the entire silly thing. In those all too brief scenes, he makes Vincent Spano's character look like a colorless, bloodless, bumbling schoolkid (not too difficult to do considering Spano's acting job), and it's just one part of the lunacy of this thing that she goes home to him when she has the glorious, magnificent masculinity of Frank Langella offered to her for the night. Are you kidding me?? He is a peerless actor who must surely count this clunker among the what-was-I-thinking parts of his resume, but he gets ten stars for turning in the movie's only moments of real passion. He invests the word ""wait"" with more sensuality than the entire rest of the cast in the entire movie combined!",1147046400,5,1333,5.036199095022624
679687,5,6303540104,"Man,is this a sexy film. Rebecca DeMornay is Robin,a paroled convict who forms a band with some people who answer an ad she placed(she's the lead singer and rhythm guitarist). Upon her release from jail she marries the handsome man who bails her out. So Robin begins her new life with her new husband Billy(Vincent Spano) and his young son,Timmy,from an earlier marriage. Handyman Billy has a younger brother who's a musician also. He also works as a sales clerk at a fast food restaurant(he was fired from the restaurant after failing to show up too many times). Billy and Robin had affairs with others during their marriage which never ended. Robin had sexual affairs with governor hopeful James Tiernan(Frank Langella). They shot pool together and Billy went bowling with another woman. After Billy an Robin engage in a sexual activity on a bed inside a museum,they're photographed by a patron. The photograph is brought to the attention of Robin's parole officer. Now Robin's about to go back to jail. Billy gets a lawyer and fights to the finish for Robin's revoked parole. James even admitted,""Miss Shay(Robin) is getting too dangerous for me."". So Robin and her band perform in a nightclub and she catches the eye of a male sex fiend. Jealous Billy beats the crap out of the sex fiend. So to keep the marriage alive,Billy plans to go to Robin's jail(Billy confessed to her that he murdered another woman).

679688,5,6303540104,"I liked this movie because I could relate to some of the relationship problems in my past i.e. 2 of 5 women who first told me they loved me then told me I'd be a lonely old guy, I told them both,better than than being a miserable young man with them. Women I've known,they all think they're smarter than me always trying to tell me stuff I already know. Anyway I liked the movie and all the arguments and humor,a typical politician got have something on the side [...],but has to becareful of his image. Rebecca DeMornay was excellent as a free spirit,not a gold digger or typical hollywood bimbo, like those other hollywood bimbos. I thought she was great in this movie,the other actors were good too. I think because of jealousy by other people in Hollywood, Ms. DeMornays efforts are not recognized. This movie was very entertaing but see it for yourself [....]",995155200,9,864,4.580645161290323
679689,2,6303540104,"This film pails in comparison to the original in both plot and execution.  The true sadness of the remake, however, is its attempt to legitimize some timely and fraudulent feminist ideals. In the original 1957 film, Brigitte  Bardot plays a young orphan trying to come to terms with the power and  curse of being a beautiful woman.  In the remake, Rebecca Demornay plays a  more mature prison inmate, completely comfortable making use of her  feminine power.  Unlike the original, Demornay's character gives herself  willingly to a man with money and power and to another man with raw sexual  appeal as long as it suits her and is on her own terms.
Both films  center around a marriage of convenience, contrived to secure the liberty of  the heroin.  In the original, the husband sees beneath the flirtatious  immaturity of the girl to the true woman desiring love and respect and  afraid she will fall short of deserving it.  She works hard to be a good  wife and is truly distraught, even self-destructive, when she fails by  committing adultery.  In the remake, the husband expects some semblance of  a marriage but is denied by the freedom demanding Demornay.  Like the  original, the marriage vows are betrayed; but, unlike the original, both  the wife and husband are guilty of adultery -a contrived attempt at  feminist parity.  Like the original, the result of the adultery is the  physical expression of outrage then forgiveness (this time by both husband  and wife), which leads to securing their love.  The problem with the remake  is there is no covenant for either to betray -both agreed with and even  encouraged the adultery.  Neither the husband nor the wife is worthy of  respect; both however demand it, making the expression of outrage  ridiculous.
This original film expresses the profundity of feminine  attractiveness and provides a glimpse at the answer to the Freudian  question, ""what do women want?"".  The original film teaches that women want  the freedom to express their femininity and sexuality within the confines  of a loving, supportive and respectful relationship.  The remake changes  the answer in light of the feminist movement. The modern woman desires  freedom above all else, demands respect without earning it and gives love  when it suits her.  The original film ends quietly, happy and triumphant in  the knowledge that the marriage is secure. The remake ends triumphantly,  but sadly, as if a change in the wind's direction, or a whim, could cause  the couples separation.",948067200,7,2516,5.0

679975,3,6303540104,"Picture color/resolution is a bit flat but not distracting. I have always enjoyed Rebecca De Mornay's acting and saw the original in a theater years ago. Given today's standards And God Created Woman would probably get a ""PG"" rating.",1361232000,,233,5.0
679976,3,6303540104,"First off lets get 2 things clear 1) I never saw nor have any desire to see Roger Vadim's original 1956 version of this film that starred Bridget Bardot. While Ms. Bardot was a striking woman in her day I am no fan of her personal quirk's  2) I adore Rebecca De Mornay I think she's in the top ten percent of attractive actresses of the past 40 years. Not a great actress although she's not bad either but she's about as attractive a screen persona as one can ever imagine. With that out of the way here's my take on the 1988 version of Roger Vadim's And God Created Woman. I generally am wary of remakes in general but like I said I was only aware of the original in passing. But this film came out some 32 years later in a more liberated era as opposed to how women in film were portrayed. Plus it was directed by the same person who did it the first time so it's no hack job done for a quick cash in. The story centers around Robin Shea played by De Mornay who starts the film breaking out of a women's prison in New Mexico. Robin wants to be a rock star( who doesn't ? ) and cannot stand being caged up thus foiling her career ambitions. After a too easy escape Robin is picked up hitching by a big shot politician named James Tiernan who is running for New Mexico's governors seat and has prison reform as part of his platform. Once Tiernan learns Robin has escaped he makes it a point to return her to jail. But he's smitten with her and wishes her luck and a swift parole. Robin actually calls Tiernan from jail later and asks him for advice on how to make parole and if he could put a good word in for her. He says he will and tells Robin that if she were to marry while in jail that it could help her get a release earlier than normal. While Robin was making her way back to jail earlier she had a quick fling with handyman/carpenter Billy Moran . Thinking Moran would be suitable husband material (and patsy) she makes him an offer marry her and she'll give him $5,000 .Billy needing the money and smitten with Robin as well reluctantly agrees. The large part of the rest of the film centers on the fragile relationship between Billy and Robin. The whole marriage thing is a farce as Robin has limited domestic ability and has no interest in Billy other than he's a means to an end. Billy meanwhile is a single Dad who has a son and his younger brother living with him .Billy's first wife ran off on him leaving him with a son and a weird sense of what marriage entails. The biggest problem I had story wise was how hard it was to actually like the Robin character. The writers seemed to try and recreate De Mornay's famous role of Lana the hooker from Risky Business and make it a bit lighter but still basically the same character. Both Lana and Robin are users who use other people for their own self interests. Lana used Tom Cruises naive and horny suburban teen as a way to escape a brutal pimp and make a living .She develops feelings for him later but it's a union that has no long term viability. Here Robin uses Billy played by Vincent Spano(very well by the way) to have a place to stay a base of operations so to speak while she attempts to launch her music career .She also trying to use Tiernan as a way to stay out of jail and use his political cache and his wealth to her advantage. Robin like Lana is a product of a broken home and has a very tough veneer that she does not want anyone to penetrate. Plus while it was obvious that Lana being a prostitute would use sex Robin also uses sex as a way to torment Billy and to seduce Tiernan .She also knows men find her attractive especially her butt and legs and uses those assets to her advantage,At one point while auditioning for a gig a promoter says to Robin "" You've got a great ass but a not so great voice"" And at a local dive bar performance with her band later on in the film Robin's non stop grinding and humping gets the males in the audience over excited and a brawl breaks out. Meanwhile while Robin is using Tiernan he's also using her for his political purposes .Having a young and beautiful ex-con as his model prisoner reformed works well for his image. James Tiernan played stoically and maturely by Frank Langella is a shrewd political animal who's way ahead of Robin even if he does give in to lust and have a fling with her. While Tiernan is the amoral creep in this film a man who'll do anything to score political clout Langella makes him seem human. The general tone of the film is a mix of drama and comedy though it's not a slapstick or raunchy sense of humor almost a black humor runs thru the film. The last 1/3 of the film becomes a made for tv level story where everything is going to end up right even if the previous 2/3rds of the film leads you to believe otherwise. Given what they wanted Robin to be basically Lana as a more comedic anti heroine Rebecca De Mornay does an admirable job as a lesser actress would make you loathe the character and maybe shut the movie off. Of course the film does it's best to showcase the beauty of Rebecca in various sex scenes and shower scenes even her seductive movements while playing bass onstage .They never let you forget that she's a beautiful woman who's using what's she's got to get what she wants. If you can't get enough De Mornay then you will likely enjoy this remake.",1356480000,,5326,4.2421259842519685

679981,3,6303540104,"I'd really give this 3.5 stars, but that's more for the nostalgia of it than any merit of the movie itself.

It's not a story never told before, people who hadn't planned on it falling in love.  But while this may be considered ""chick flick"" material, it's really more of a guy flick simply because of the nudity of the lead actress.  Pleasing to look at, definitely.  And worth the price of the movie right there.

But acting was alright, not stellar, and while it had its good moments, it really is a slow ride, with little original in it.

But it reminds me of the time and place where I first saw it, back in Germany, and so I had to get it more as a memento to a happy time in my life rather than a ""must have it"" movie in my collection.

So if you'd seen it before and wanted it as a fond memory, it's worth it, but if you haven't seen it before, go into it with your eyes open and knowing you're getting something that clearly was made in the 80's. :)  Unless you're a Rebecca De Mornay fan, in which case you either already have it, or it's a must have for your collection...",1275523200,,1083,4.099526066350711
