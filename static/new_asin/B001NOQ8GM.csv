8327599,3,B001NOQ8GM,"What happened to repeat on the other side. As the one other review said, good exercises...poor and dieting or production.
Having used a roller before they were fashionably commonplace, I. Hope to learn new tricks. What I found was some good bits, but often the flow missed a side of the body. You'd do one side, then move to something else.
Thought I was missing something.
It was.",1421971200,,381,4.617647058823529
8327600,3,B001NOQ8GM,"I've used a roller for years at the suggestion of a physical therapist so I'm used to moving around on a roller. Keli's choice of exercises is great, she covers a lot of areas that can get really tense. The part that bothered me was the editing of the video. The warm-up was less than a minute and only covered the hips then ended abruptly. The other workouts were just exerpts from a video she shot and when played separately, they begin and end abruptly. No introductions, warmups or conclusions. Overall, the exercises are good but it's best to play all of them to get the full effect.",1300924800,10,588,4.453703703703703
