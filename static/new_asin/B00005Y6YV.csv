1674746,5,B00005Y6YV,"If you have Chaplin, Keaton or Arbuckle sets you probably already have some of these films. But at such a great price duplication shouldn't be an issue. I found about 6 hours of these films to be first rate silent comedy and another 10+ hours to be at least interesting. Arbuckle and Chaplin are both represented by over an hour each. There are also 3 films each featuring Lloyd,Langdon,Bevan and Keaton. Laurel and Hardy each appear twice seperately as well as in 23 minutes of clips from their team shorts. I was most surprised to find a complete one reeler starring John Bunny, one of the comic stars predating Chaplin. Other favorites include Mack Swain in A Movie Star, Harry Langdon in Saturday Afternoon and All Night Long, Charley Chase with Oliver Hardy and Eugene Pallette in Fluttering Hearts, Arbuckle and Normand in the awesome Fatty and Mabel Adrift, the Ton of Fun in Three of a Kind and the three Chaplin films of which The Rink is one of his very best. You see some stars doing stunts on trains and others working with real lions and snakes. The music is excellent and there are no intrusive narrations. You do have to make your own list of titles for each disc and the discs can be a little hard to remove but better too tight than too loose. All in all you get 29 two reelers, 20 one reelers and 5 three reelers. 24 of these films were made in the 1910's and 30 were made in the 1920's. After watching these 18 hours of film from 90 years ago it's apparent to me that people really haven't changed very much at all.",1351036800,3,1534,4.404929577464789
1674747,1,B00005Y6YV,"Well, Cheap and Defective do usually go together, don't they?  I cannot recommend this compilation from Amazon.  If any of you have purchased this and can easily view ALL the movies on all 5 DVDs with no problem, I would like to hear about it.  Please go the * below for more details.

There is no written index for the movies on these DVDs.  You have 5 DVDs with scores of movies, but no list in the booklet or on the DVD case to tell you which movies are on which DVD.  This is INCREDIBLY inconvenient!

On each DVD, the Main menu is one of those annoying things where it takes a while for the selections to come up; each time you go to the menu, you have to wait while the menu loads a bunch of moving images.  The selection process is also annoying: even if you pick a specific movie, after it's done the DVD goes on to the following movie instead of bringing you back to the main menu so you can decide for yourself what you want to see next.

Three of the DVDs in my batch were defective; I have two DVD players, so if a movie kept stopping, I would put the DVD into the other player which sometimes could play it.  However, I was unable to view two of the three Langdon films, several of the final films on DVD 3, and The Iron Mule, after which I just gave up and have returned the set to Amazon requesting a replacement.  I was unable to PULL THE LOWER RIGHT DVD OUT OF ITS SLOT!!  (If the other DVDs had not been defective, I would have sliced this one out of the case.  But that would have complicated returning the product to Amazon, eh?)

OK, so enough of the bad news!  The good news is that this is a set of 5 (FIVE!!) DVDs with lots of comedies you may have heard of (or not) but never seen.  And the quality is good, as is the quality of most of the soundtracks.  AND it's CHEAP!  Very worth taking a chance on.  If you don't care much for one or another movie, guess what?  Another one is next and you just might love it!

Of the movies I watched, I would say that this is indeed an interesting and valuable historical ""encyclopedic"" set of 1910's and 20's comedies.  Not all the movies are easy to sit through, however.  And they are not all among the best representations of these comedians.  Stan Laurel was said to have called Alice Howell one of the 10 greatest comedians; I have now seen 3 of her movies and I remain unimpressed.  I wish this collection had a better film by her than the one chosen here, ""One Wet Night"", which was not only a yawner, but Howell doesn't even have much to do in it.

Some of the music for these films really helps pull them along.  I was extremely happy to finally find a copy of ""Teddy At The Throttle"" in a good print with Robert Israel's EXCELLENT orchestral music.  In many cases the music for an otherwise mediocre movie actually kept my interest throughout some of the dull stretches of aimless running about and falling down.  Eric Beheim's music-and-sound-effects are very much to my taste.  He thoroughly brings comedies to life and I find nothing to criticize with his musical comments on the action.  Rodney Sauer's absolutely delightful music, played by the Mont Alto Orchestra, really helped keep my interest throughout the Arbuckle film ""Fatty and Mabel Adrift"" which is actually quite a good movie but a little long.  I do wish more restoration had been done here for the image: some parts of the movie are washed out and could be easily fixed with added contrast; other shots are overly contrasty and need to go the other way.  The whole film has ugly garish tinting that should have been faded down a bit.  (Given the great ease of using modern movie-editing software, like Final Cut, I am always surprised by what has NOT been done to restore a film.  It cannot be the money, since surely there are many like me who would do it for free if the movie interested me enough.)

On the other hand, Brian Benison pretty much sucks the life out of the first several movies on DVD1.  His music is generic and does not correspond well to the tempo of the action.  It's also very ""synthesized"" and becomes irritating after a while.  I hope David Shepard stops hiring him.  However, I give him credit for doing quite a good job with the Larry Semon movie ""The Grocery Clerk"".  This is one of Benison's best work.  (Personally, I yearn for the Italian dubs of Larry Semon's ""Ridolini"" movies.)  The other excellent job by Benison is for the Arbuckle movie ""Oh, Doctor!"".  Here Benison matches the tempo of the music to the tempos in the film extremely well, using almost all 5 or 6 of the pieces he knows how to play (and which he uses over and over and over in almost every vintage movie he scores, whether it's a George Melies film, an Arbuckle film, a Semon film, or whatever.  What a job!  You get paid to play the same music for one film that you used before on another film.)

The image quality of all the films I WAS able to watch was fair to quite good.  Nothing was unwatchable.  Of the movies I watched on the first 4 discs (until I finally gave up because of the defective DVDs), and aside from the Keaton and Langdon (which I already own on other DVDs), only ""Teddy At The Throttle"" and ""Wandering Willies"" (with another GREAT soundtrack by Robert Israel) were good enough movies that I would subject my friends and family to them.  However, given the low cost, it may be worthwhile to purchase this set just for these two films.  Once I get my replacement discs, I'll watch the films I was unable to play through, and report back then.*  I wish I could have finished ""The Iron Mule"" which seemed very good, but the DVD kept stopping until it would not play at all.

  ~  ~  ~  *  ~  ~  ~
*I have now received my replacements.  DVD#2 still stopped playing before the end and I was unable to watch ""His Marriage Wow"" and ""All Night Long"".  In fact, not only did ""All Night..."" not play, but ultimately gave me a blank monitor and I had to remove the DVD to get anything to work.  DVD4 would not play ""Now You Tell One"" and would not play ""The Grocery Clerk"".  I was also unable to play all the way through ""Mighty Like A Moose"", which stuck half way through the film.  I was unable to even start to watch ""Big Moments from Little Pictures"" and ""Haunted Spooks"".

Apparently this current batch being sold by Amazon is defective.  We must either wait until a new batch comes in, or buy it elsewhere from a batch that may not be so bad.  If any one you have purchased this new edition of ""Slapstick"" and it works fine for you, I would be interested to know (1) where did you get it, and (2) what kind of DVD/Blu-Ray player do you have.

Back to the original review:
  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~

This is a super-duper collection if you do NOT already have or plan to buy the Kino set of Keaton short movies, the set of ""Harry Langdon Lost and Found"", the Chaplin Mutual films, and Kino's Charlie Chase DVDs.  But if you like those comedians, you really, REALLY should buy those DVD compilations...before something happens and they go out of circulation!  This Encyclopedia collection seems most fitting to the needs of those who only want one inexpensive set of silent comedies.  For this, it is excellent; it has a good smattering of great movies by The Four Greats of early comedy: Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd and Langdon.  PLUS it has a hefty selection of the Other comedians people went to see in them Old Days.  For the rest of us, I wish this compilation had fewer (or none) of the Top Four and more of The-Best-Of the lesser seen comics and comedy movies.  HOWEVER, remember the price!  This set is SO DIRT CHEAP (and with such good image and soundtrack quality) that it's worth getting even if it means you will have duplicates of certain films.  (Of course this all assumes you can actually PLAY all the films on these DVDs.)  Also, the musical accompaniments here are much, much better than the music on the other DVD/Blu-Ray collections.  For instance, Keaton's ""The Boat"" has a delightful, engaging, toe-tapping orchestral score by Robert Israel, which is head-and-shoulders above the adequate but unimaginative (and even a little depressing) organ music on the Kino set of Keaton shorts.  (I was finally able to watch some of the other films on a Pioneer DVD player, and the Langdon films, too, have superior music-tracks to the other Langdon DVD set of his shorts.  I also made it through ""The Iron Mule"", which has no story but is chock full of incredibly interesting images from a bygone era (great details in the directing by Roscoe Arbuckle), amazing stunt work and physical comedy by even the oldest members of the troupe, and has an SUPERB soundtrack by Eric Beheim.  I have watched this film many times.)

SPECIAL NOTE:  One of the selections here is ""Chasing Choo Choos"", a stunning film, but which is only the last two reels of the feature film ""Play Safe"".  Film Preservation Associates would do us all a great favor by releasing this film in its complete version (which is what I would want to show an audience, rather than the cut version).  I wish they had included the complete ""Play Safe"" as the ""bonus"" film, instead of the shorts they supply, as this is really the sleeper find of the decade. And as good as Eric Beheim's soundtrack is for this condensed version of the movie (and it is VERY good!), I would be even happier if  ""Play Safe"" were fully restored and got the Robert Israel full-orchestra treatment, like the musical accompaniment he made for Larry Semon's ""Wizard of Oz"", which helped to greatly raise my opinion about that movie.  OR give Beheim the resources to arrange for an orchestra (instead of his usual computer-band).  Anybody out there listening?",1348963200,16,9657,4.43125
1674748,4,B00005Y6YV,"This review is for the Sept. 25,2012 re-release of KINO's SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA. Reviews before this date are for the KINO product, this review is for the IMAGE re-release of the same material which is no longer available from KINO.

This is really great stuff and needs to be made available, and IMAGE, as well as KINO, offers a superior product as noted by all of the other reviewers (pre 9-25).

The bargain is that you get over 50 classic comedy shorts (over 18 hours!) on 5 dvds, and the price for this amounts to only a few bucks per disc, as AMAZON is currently listing this set at around 10 dollars. And the shorts look pretty good too! For years I've suffered with poor copies of these films on vhs with no or poor musical tracking. And with David Shepard and Joe Adamson involved, along with musical soundtracks by Robert Israel and others, you know you're in for a good ride.

So far, so good...

Then some bad news...Despite handsome packaging in a 3-part fold-away, the discs themselves are inserted into slits, which upon removal can cause damage and/or scratches to the dvds. I carefully removed mine without incident and put each disc into a seperate case to avoid future damage. None were scratched during the process.

And despite a nice permanently-affixed booklet written by Joe Adamson on silent film comedy, no listing of any film or timing is ever given, on the product packaging or in the booklet. I guess you have to already know what KINO had previously released. Here, you just pop in a disc to see what comes up.

Still, all in all, a GREAT SET at a GREAT PRICE and this one is very, very highly recommended.

UPDATE*UPDATE*UPDATE* (11-7-12)

With several reviewers citing defective discs I became concerned about mine as I've yet to encounter any problems. True, I have not yet watched every short here, but I did put in each disc and watched a short or two and they all played fine.

One reviewer made special issue with disc 2, HIS MARRIAGE WOW stopping and ALL NIGHT LONG appearing as a blank monitor. So I played disc 2 completely through to see if it was indeed defective and it played just fine. HIS MARRIAGE WOW and ALL NIGHT LONG both just fine, no skipping, stalling, freezing, stopping or blank monitor.

Got my set from Amazon when it first became available, so it was probably from the same batch as the other reviewers' sets.

Because silent comedy shorts are not the most popular viewing subject in my household, I've been quarantined to watching these on my emachines computer which I bought at Walmart 14 months ago. Maybe that has something to do with it.

All I know is that my set appears ok. Maybe for once I just got lucky.",1348876800,5,2674,4.59453781512605

1674751,5,B00005Y6YV,"Fifteen hours and 53 films worth of silent slapstick is a LOT of silent slapstick.  Before you go any farther you should realize this isn't the greatest 15 hours worth of silent slapstick available.  If you want to get the best - the funniest stuff - buy the boxed sets of Chaplin, Lloyd, Keaton and Laurel & Hardy, and then see if you can find a compilation disk with some Harry Langdon and Fatty Arbuckle on it.  Oh, the heavy hitters are here, but it's the inclusion of so much by the other guys that sets this set apart.  If you like silent movies and are willing to sit through some strange stuff for no other reason than to see what folks were laughing at 100 years ago, this set is for you.  I think it's a gold mine.  A sprawling gold mine, but priceless to anyone interested in the history of filmed comedy. Each disk is divided into two sections.  To give a sense of the breadth of this set, I'll briefly mention the highlights - or lowlights - of each section.

 1-`Pioneers' - Section one of disk one features the pioneers of silent slapstick and contains, I believe, the earliest film in this collection, the 4-minute long `Mr. Flip' (1909), starring cross-eyed comic Ben Turpin.  Mr. Griffith hadn't invented the close-up yet so we don't get a chance to see Turpin's crossed money makers.  This film has Mr. Flip flirting with every woman he comes across and getting slapped with shaving cream, pies, etc., for his trouble.  No plot, not even a real start or end, and really not very funny, but oddly engaging.

  2- `Keystone Tonight' - Ninety odd minutes worth of early Mack Sennett/Keystone Studio one- and two-reelers.  Highlight is the 16-minute `The Rounders' from 1914.  Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle star as a couple of lushes who flee from their wives so they can continue getting sloshed in the hotel bar.  A lot of funny-drunk sight gags.  Both had and would make more memorable films, but interesting to see how these two ad-lib off each other.  This section also contains Harry Langdon's `Saturday Afternoon,' (1926, 30mins.) one of those `hen-pecked husband stepping out' movies.  Some claim Langdon was the fourth great silent comedian, and his films are generally less available than Chaplin's, or Keaton's, or Lloyds's.  As an innocent man-child, somewhat the waif, and a great pantomime, Langdon reminded me a lot of Stan Laurel. A somewhat creepy Laurel, to be sure.  There are a couple more Langdon shorts in this set, so you can decide his claim to glory for yourself.

 3- `Sennett in the `20s' - More madcap mayhem from one of the kings of silent movie producers.  Because it's Sennett, coherence and continuity are going to take a back seat - or asked to take a walk - over speed and visual gags.  In the 20-minute `Circus Today' (1926) Sennett favorites Bill Bevans and Andy Clyde play a couple of bumbling circus hands.  Beauty Madeline Hurlock plays the circus bare-back rider.  Bevans is the competent, if unmemorable, knockabout comedian with the brush moustache.  Not unusual for a comedy of this era, the stars are gleefully put in harm's way every 2 minutes or so.  At one point a cage full of lions escape and, naturally, chase all the main players.  In one very memorable scene, the tutu-clad Ms. Hurlock is seen flat on the ground with a 400-pound male lion sitting on top of her.  No process shot in this one, and I'd imagine no second take, either.

4- `Funny Girls: Genders and Their Benders.' Slapsticks starring female actresses Gale Henry, Alice Howard, et al.

5- `Keaton, Arbuckle, and St. John.'  Fatty Arbuckle with Mabel Normand, a couple of Arbuckle and Keaton collaborations, one Keaton solo and one two-reeler featuring Arbuckle nephew Al St. John.  Keaton's solo outing `The Boat' (1921) is the best film in the entire collection, and a textbook example of how to build and sustain a gag.

6- `Hal Roach's Acts: Star Comedians.'  Five shorts from the Hal Roach studio, including a Stan Laurel solo project, a Charley Chase domestic comedy, and a Will Rogers' spoof of contemporary hit movies by Valentino and Fairbanks.  Also in this section are a couple of shorts starring Harold Lloyd, including his winning 1920 horror spoof, `Haunted Spooks.'

7-`Hal Roach: The Lot of Fun.' Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang, Charley Chase, and Snub Pollard.  The `Laurel & Hardy Lafftoons' was the only disappointing entry in this set.  `Lafftoons' is the only instance in which compiled highlight scenes, rather than a complete film, was presented.  Laurel and Hardy are a favorite of mine, but I would have preferred seeing all of `Angora Love,' rather than a short scene from it.  Charley Chase is perhaps the most consistently sophisticated comic in this set.  Chase uses slapstick to accent characters and situations and push the plot ahead - pretty much the diametric opposition of how it was usually done.

8- `Chaplin and the Music Hall Tradition.' Or, Chaplin and his imitators.  This sections opens with 1915's `A Night in the Show,' with Charlie playing two roles - Mr. Pest and Mr. Rowdy - whose names ought to clue you in to what kind of (inebriated) theater goers they are.  One is tuxedoed and sits in a box seat, one is shabbily dressed and sits way back up in the cheap seats.  One of the more curious shorts in this set is 1918's `He's in Again,' with Billy West - who looks and dresses just like Chaplin - as an out-at-the-heels bar customer.  West was the most successful of Chaplin imitators, and, if nothing else, this short gives you a direct example of the difference between competence and genius.

9- `The Race is On.'  Four shorts here, all celebrating speed and all featuring some of the most hair-raising footage you'll ever see.  The worst is Monty Bank's 1927 `Chasing Choo Choos.'  It's easy to take scary stuff on film when you know there's CGI or some other film trick involved.  Some of the stunts in this one defy an obvious explanation.  In one scene - the one that had me on the edge of my seat - Banks has two feet in a racing race car (one that the driver had bailed out of!) and two hands on a speeding locomotive.  Simply the most amazing stunt I've ever seen.

10- `Anarchic Fringe.'  Well, we finally get to see a Ben Turpin close-up in `Yukon Jake' (1924).  The biggest surprise, to some, will be Charley Bowers' 1926 `Now You Tell One.'  Bowers, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Buster Keaton, tells his story to a gathering of the Liars' Club.  Bowers included stop-action animation in his shorts, was really a pioneer in the field, and his story includes a rapidly growing eggplant that contains an egg and salt shaker, shoe strings that tie themselves, and other such fanciful nonsense.",1174867200,24,6698,4.701030927835052
1674752,4,B00005Y6YV,"I agree with all of the rave reviews.

But I give this set only 4 stars because of the poor presentation of Laurel & Hardy.  For some reason we are given edited TV cut-downs that are not up to the current restorations on the Lost Films of Laurel & hardy DVD sets.  They are cut to where there is no sence to what is happening and are a waste of time to watch.

Another small disappointement is the Charlie Chaplins, they are not the current restorations on the new Chaplin DVD sets from Warners.  They look acceptable, but not up to the the New restorations.

I also wish some attempt was made to re-create original looking title cards & end titles for the shorts that were missing them.  The LostFilms of Laurel & Hardy and the Kino Comedy Classic sets do this.

For those curious, here is the rundown of the many films in this set:

1674753,5,B00005Y6YV,"The Slapstick Encyclopedia is chock full of entertaining, rare movies from the earliest days of silent movies.  Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, Stan Laurel without Oliver Hardy, Oliver Hardy without Stan Laurel, Bustard Keaton, Hal Roach comedies, Harold Loyd in Haunted Spooks,  Harry Langdon, Will Rogers, Keystone cops...all the unforgettable greats, you may have only read about in books, and rarely seen, doing the antics that once made movies so special.  Included is the rarest of rare, a 1916 film starring Great black entertainer Bert Williams doing some of the comic routines that made him famous and part of America's conscience for decades after his death.  Sure to entertain for hours on end.",1044662400,12,706,5.276785714285714
1674754,5,B00005Y6YV,"There are some great and not-so-great items in this set, but all are of interest, if you like silent comedies.  I recommend the 3 shorts each by Harry Langdon and Harold Lloyd (with one caveat to be discussed for ""Haunted Spooks""), the rare version of Buster Keaton's ""The Boat,"" some of the solo efforts by Stan Laurel (of later Laurel & Hardy fame), the ""Hairbreadth Harry"" short entitled ""Danger Ahead"" (based on a 1920's comic strip and one of the most ridiculously inspired things I've ever seen), the teaming of Charlie Chaplin and ""Fatty"" Arbuckle in ""The Rounders"" (where they each try to top one another on screen), and the delirious short by Charley Bowers (the only successful comedian/animator in film history--who incorporates his bizarre animation into his film shorts).
You can see so much here, as to the development of the careers of famous silent comedians.  See Buster Keaton's crying and mugging hysterics while with ""Fatty"" Arbuckle develop into his more familiar stoic ""Great Stone Face."" See Stan Laurel go from frenetic nasty idiot on screen to playing the more sublime ""Stanley"" in the Laurel and Hardy shorts.  See early Harold Lloyd shorts where his character has a bit more of an edge. Wonder why Ben Turpin had a career at all.  All along marvel at the wonderful, appropriate musical accompaniment, sometimes on the odd ""Fotoplayer.""
The caveat?  Well, nothing and I mean nothing has been censored and some very politically incorrect moments also make the cut, a few of which can make for some startling viewing for modern sensibilities. Then again, these films are 75 to 90 years old, and that should be borne in mind.  In particular, I'm thinking of ""The Detectress"" and ""Haunted Spooks"" and parts of the Bert Williams short as rather blatant offenders. Also, while the prints included are some of the best surviving, a small number have some nitrate decomposition, sprocket jump, discoloration, and the like.  As an example, the quality of ""The Garage"" with Keaton/Arbuckle's a little disappointing compared to some other prints I've watched. However, these are often very rare films, and rough prints can be better than none.
I'd recommend this set both as a tremendous resource and a great bargain for any seasoned silent movie fan as well as any novice fan who wants to learn more in a hurry.",1031097600,29,2327,4.936061381074169
1674755,5,B00005Y6YV,"I previously reviewed this set but wanted to add a few comments. Included here is the incredible film ""Now you tell one"" by Charlie Bowers. Bowers looks like Keaton but out Keatons Keaton! After years of working in animation, Bowers took his surreal special effects into film. The result is jaw dropping! Wait until you see him 'grow"" cats - and watch out for the little mouse with the revolver!
Monty Banks gives us one of the most thrilling chases ever seen in film in ""chasing choo-choos"". It looks like he did all of his stunts here and it is amazing that he lived to tell about it!
Definitely a great collection. Where else can you get silent films for about a dollar each? Do I like all of them? No. But with over 50 films, there is plenty here to enjoy and thrill to.",1026086400,24,774,4.344827586206897
1674758,1,B00005Y6YV,"Sadly I made the mistake of buying this item last autumn and then put it on a shelf until I wanted to use it.  Which is now.  But now I find the discs to be defective, and it's too late to do anything about it - certainly with Amazon at least.  I have contacted Image in the hope that they may replace the set, but I don't hold out much hope.  It's a great shame, as there is much to enjoy here.  Yes, the lack of contents page is frustrating (and inexcusable, to be fair), but so far I have at least two discs that stop halfway through.  Both The Boat and Haunted Spooks send me back to the main menu halfway through after sticking.  I'm sure many others do too, but I'm getting fed up with watching half-films now, and so will pursue a belated replacement.",1375228800,5,758,4.115646258503402

1674762,5,B00005Y6YV,I'm not an early film buff but I grew up watching the Three Stooges. Love Charlie Chaplin. I bought this to play on a large screen during an adult birthday pool party. Great background! And the music accompaniment helped set a fun light mood. I still haven't watched all of the DVD's. I don't remember seeing any of the videos on the DVD's before. Great early Little Rascals film. Can't beat the price.,1363564800,2,402,4.52054794520548

1674765,1,B00005Y6YV,"Image Entertainment bought Madacy in 2010. Can you beleive that! Image Ent the best friend to us film collectors, and Madacy the film collector's WORST enemy! This Box Set is a reissue of Image Entertainment's 2002 release. The only positive thing to say about this collection is that we have some of the rarest silent films existing. Most of the prints are 16mm prints from the Blackhawk Films collection.

The negative comments are as follows:

PACKAGING: The packaging is HORRIBLE! The discs are shoved into tight sleeves that have a small foam hub to secure the disc. It is IMPOSSIBLE not scratch the disc when removing it from the sleeve.

PRESENTATION: Most prints are from the Blackhawk Films collection, and are 16mm. Other prints are from various sources, but are more than acceptable. However, many titles DO NOT have opening credits! The films start at the opening scene! The films without opening credits appear to be the Blackhawk prints. Was Image Ent and David Shepard using these prints without permission? I think not, David Shepard owns the rights to the Blackhawk colletion thru Film Preservation Associates. So why are the credits missing?

DISC ERRORS: The Box Set comes with 5 discs. I had trouble with three discs freezing at certain points, and based on reviews this seems to be problem everyone is having. However, it seems to be only with the 2012 release, not the original 2002 Image Ent release.

So there you have it, a good opportunity wasted. Image Entertainment seems to be lowering their standards, and becoming more like Madacy. Avoid this release until Image gets their act together, and fixes the problems.",1358035200,8,1642,4.956363636363636
1674766,4,B00005Y6YV,"On this set you get a great overview of early slapstick films for a great price.

The drawbacks are that the menu-formatting is preserved from earlier releases and is a bit confusing (and slow) and that there is no comprehensive list of the fikms anywhere on the set (a pretty egregious oversight).  Also, it uses a clip-compilation as its Laurel & Hardy content (which seems like a poor decision).

It's still a great value for the money (and for the record I've had no problems with defective discs)

The discs in this set are universally defective. In fact, if you got a set that didn't have a defective disc, you're lucky. They stall, they won't play, they're jittery, or the picture is pixelated. Whoever created the masters did an amateurish job. Even the menus on the discs are stupidly designed.

Shame on Image for releasing this junk for sale. Even the cheap price doesn't make up for the fact that you can't watch 1 -5  of the discs.

The packaging on this set appears to be nice, but it, too, is garbage. The discs are very difficult to remove from the sleeves. You may not be able to remove the discs in some cases, because they stick to the glossy cardboard sleeves.

Some of the musical accompaniments are average where others suit the films well. Some of it is racial and that might turn some people off. But there are some gems here. Ford Sterling in a more serious comical role. Keaton's ""The Boat"" which is probably the best entry. Early Ben Turpin, a rare short of Chaplin conducting extempore a live orchestra concert. Female comedians with names long forgotten, a fine Max Linder short, a very fine Lupino Lane comedy as well as a good Harold Lloyd example. There's a lot to look over. Something in here will make you happy if you like silent screen comedy.",1461456000,,767,4.731343283582089
