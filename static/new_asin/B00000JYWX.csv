8175028,5,B00000JYWX,I would reccommend any New York Giants fan to buy this VHS tape. It was great to watch on how Tim Mara bought the Giants for $500.00 as well as his sons helping with the operations of running the team. I liked watching the Giant players of the past starting from 1925. Previews and interviews of the sneakers games in 1934 and 1956. And of course the two Super Bowls in 1987 and 1991.,1336262400,,384,4.202702702702703

This is a must have for any one who loves the Giants. I'm only 18 and I did not know much about the history of the team.  After watching this video, I know more than my uncle.  I am also using this video for my research paper for college about the history of the team.",969926400,,402,3.7951807228915664
