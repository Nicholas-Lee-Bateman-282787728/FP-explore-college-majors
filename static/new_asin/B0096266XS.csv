8536449,3,B0096266XS,"Vintage, 1970s - era Elton John concert footage is hard to find on DVD. If that's
what you're looking for, this 1976 concert from Scotland is okay, although Elton
(he wasn't knighted yet) comes across as more subdued and intimate (no backup
band to be found here). I'd recommend his 1974 Christmas concert DVD over
this, he really throws himself into the songs on that DVD; there are more tunes
to be found there as well.",1480982400,,421,4.552631578947368
