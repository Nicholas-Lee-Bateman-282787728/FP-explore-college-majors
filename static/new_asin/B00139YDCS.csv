8249569,5,B00139YDCS,"I am collecting the parts and Matchbox cars for the 1970 Hero-City play set.  One of the buildings that is used with the street play mat is the Haunted House.  I chose this DVD to show to my 2 year old grandson.  He was spell-bound and sat through the entire DVD.  As an elderly grandmother it is important to build memories with my family.  We will eventually play with the cars and buildings when he visits me and one day they will be his to keep for his children.
