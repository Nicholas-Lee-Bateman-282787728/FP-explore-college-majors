8339242,5,B001RXC566,"Every actor and director should own the DVD's:  The Method with Lorrie Hull, Ph. D. and Acting Techniques-Advanced: The Method II.  The entire training of method actors and directors is covered in these 2 DVD's based on the book,""Strasberg's Method as Taught by Lorrie Hull:  A Practical Guide for Actors, Teachers and Directors.""  The technques of Kazan, Strasberg and Stanislavski are explained and demonstrated.  I recommend all 3 sold by amazon not only to those in the theatre and film industries, but also to the general public who wish to learn how many well-known actors and directors work.  The explanations and demonstrations should be of interest to the general audience as well as to practitioneers.  The explanations and demonstrations are clear and method techniques are most understandable.",1234915200,3,805,5.291338582677166
