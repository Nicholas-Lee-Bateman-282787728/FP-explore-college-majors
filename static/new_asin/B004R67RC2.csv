4457290,5,B004R67RC2,"Loved it!! A very cute movie about perseverance and the willingness to reinvent oneself after life altering events.  Very well casted, on both the good side and the bad side.",1316390400,,174,4.8
4457291,1,B004R67RC2,"OMG! Admittedly, I'm not a fan of chick flicks, but be warned: This one really stinks. Even my wife thought so! Horrible acting, incredibly trite dialogue. You name it, this flick has all the worst that incredibly bad romantic comedies have to offer. Claire Forlani is going to have a tough time getting a real acting gig after this stinker. She's got this cutesy schtik that is so played out! Even when her beau craps all over her, she comes back with her quirky smile and all is forgiven. Really??! And what is up with her face! Isn't she a little young for a Joan Rivers style facelift. She should sue the plastic surgeon... her mouth actualy looks crooked now.

And some people might think Irish accents are cute... but we could barely make out what they were saying. This movie is so bad it's almost a parody of itself. None of things the characters do is even remotely believable. I don't know what the other reviewers here are smoking, but it must be really strong stuff!",1316131200,2,978,4.52542372881356
4457292,4,B004R67RC2,interesting to see how different a english movie is made as compared to an american movie.  there is a lot of differences,1314576000,,121,4.5
4457293,4,B004R67RC2,"I just finished watching this movie, and found it cute and entertaining. For those that like to pick a movie apart, you will probably find all kinds of things not to like about it, however I watch movies for entertainment, and generally go for feel good movies. This fit the bill, and was a great way to spend the afternoon. No stellar performances, but I like Claire Forlani, and the balance of the actors were funny and quirky.",1309737600,80,429,4.512820512820513
4457294,5,B004R67RC2,"I got to see an advance screening of this film and can recommend it for nearly anyone (it may make you hungry, though!)

Good performances and great food throughout the movie; nothing that will win an Oscar, but nice romance, drama and a pleasant ending. ""Love's Kitchen"" is a great date flick, too!",1307318400,3,299,4.6415094339622645
4457295,1,B004R67RC2,"Ms. Forlani must be bored out of her mind.  Why else would a major ''American"" actress work in this poorly executed film.",1517702400,,121,4.5

4457302,1,B004R67RC2,Boring... Turned it off after about 15-20 minutes.,1514592000,,50,5.375
4457303,5,B004R67RC2,its a great movie,1514160000,,17,3.5
4457304,1,B004R67RC2,"I let this one go at about halfway.  I did not like the leads, especially Claire Forlani, who seemed unattractive and brittle.  I thought the British accents a bit overwhelming (although I am rarely bothered by this in other films).  The story did not grab my interest --- boring.",1513728000,,280,4.673469387755102
4457305,5,B004R67RC2,"I find this movie to be very moving. So.e of the reviews state that it's boring, and the script is weak. You need to watch this movie again. And the comment about the chemistry between Mr. Scott and his wife Claire Forlani, well if you don't have chemistry, you don't have it! It doesn't matter if your married or not.
I'm not a writer so my words may be a little misunderstood.  But when I first came to watch this movie, it was because I saw Dougray Scott in Ever After. Then I looked up the movies he has filmed. I think he is so handsome and intriguing.  His performance in Ever After was amazing. But to my surprise was the fact he is married to Claire Forlani!!! Oh my! I was so happy! I love her! She was amazing in Meet Joe Black! I have to say she is beautiful. Her eyes are captivating! And she is so sweet!
So with that said, I love this movie. This is a movie of love, family, love lost,  and how one deals with carrying out your life after such a horrible situation.  Claire also has a loss if a marraige gone bad, and a father who was not there for her in younger years.
But what impacted me the most was Mr. Scott's love for his wife he lost. It showed his weakness, but yet that weakness was honor and love for his wife lost. It made me cry so much! He is adorable. But when Claire came on the scene it was obvious she captivated him, and he was ready to say goodbye to his first love he lost.

I love British humor! This movie was halarious with its humor here and there. But what is important is if you see the work put into making this movie simple, yet having a heart warming sentiment to it's direction of what the point of it all is.
Life is love, and sometimes loss. It's how we come out of it all in the end. We may not like the things that happen along the way, but it's what you do in the process.
Another observation. It was in the scene where Michelle gets the trifle for the two gentlemen. She is wearing a apron. That apron looks just like the one I have from Portugal.  Curious where it's from.
Lastely,  Mr. Scott and Claire, you are a beautiful couple and I love all your movies.  You have a handsome Scotsman,  and Mr. Scott you have a beautiful wife! Please don't let Hollywood spoil that! Stay in love! Stay together!
I love your movie! And look forward to seeing more of you both in the future!
God bless",1511308800,2,2341,4.116228070175438

4457308,5,B004R67RC2,Lovely movie to watch on a quiet weekend day. Cute and funny with a dash of culinary fun. A bit of sorrow shows real human feeling and how a loss can change us.,1509840000,,160,3.878787878787879
4457309,3,B004R67RC2,Couldn't finish this despite being excited that the lead characters are married in real life. Every other word is a swear word. Terrible script... what are we teaching our kids? The plot was all over the place in the beginning. Poor post production.  shame for such  a strong cast. But the language ... my ears.,1508630400,,311,4.636363636363637
4457310,2,B004R67RC2,"Not sure if it's the script or directing, but this is a truly mediocre movie. Acting matched both, and it felt like they were just going through the motions.

4457315,3,B004R67RC2,"Slow motion and drawn out.
Watching wheels on a car driving on a road for 20 seconds is a sure sign, of a ""B"" movie. Lacks creativity!!

4457323,3,B004R67RC2,"Some of the actors were talented, but the script is pretty weak. And why in the bloody hell is Ramsay on the cover?  If you think it's worth a watch to see him, you'll be disappointed.  A mediocre movie to watch if you're bored and want to watch a movie that has no blood or gore or negativity.

Also it was hard to buy the crying for great mother and wife when the little we saw of her was speeding thru the country side in her Mercedes running a stop sign and getting back on the phone after her husband asks her to not drive and talk on phone. Her lack of regard for laws and others on the road does not equal great person.

Well I guess this explains why he would fall for the c#!t if a lead character when the extent of her personality is. Look how hot I am. Watch my stick my lips out while i stand here.

Something clearly went very wrong in the digitization process, which means if you're looking for a headache and eyestrain, this movie will do it for you. I honestly can't give a fair review to the film since I couldn't make it beyond the first 15 minutes. From what I saw, the acting is good, the script is believable, and the story is touching.

***Spoiler Alert below as to why it wasn't good:***

-When wife died, they didn't do a good job of showing him and his daughter really suffering any loss other than his poor cooking
-All of a sudden he just wants to cook well again? No particular reason... just because.
-Food critic pisses chef off, so they don't even like each other to begin with and she keeps showing up to hang out with him and his daughter - seemingly uninvited.  Doesn't make any sense.
-He doesn't like her, but ends up spending an evening with her after she gives him a review and ends up kissing her.
-Looks like her whole job is to just give one review and that's his restaurant.

4458444,3,B004R67RC2,"I bought this DVD on the reputation of Chef Gordon Ramsay from his various reality show series. I am also a fan of Claire Forlani from all the way back when she starred opposite Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt in ""Meet Joe Black"".

My rating is based on the quality of the actors within, as the script is the lowest point of the comedy/melodrama and really needed tossed in the bin (Ramsay speak). Claire Forlani's character shows no interest in cooking or being in the kitchen, and it's a mystery why these people want to be anywhere near a restaurant. I would have preferred had Ramsay had the role as head chef, with Douray Scott working under him and getting yelled at the whole movie for ruining the Beef Wellington.

Special mention for Simon Callow (who played the villain in Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) as Guy Witherspoon, hamming it up with expert precision as an obnoxious and fatuitous restaurant food critic. Actors like Guy Boardman carry the movie, you can see other accomplished talent straining to convey some acting to the consomm&eacute;-thin soup of a script. Watch it for the actors, and try to forget there are writers like this employed in the movie industry.",1458518400,,1182,4.733009708737864

4458658,5,B004R67RC2,"First off let me say I'm a sucker for rom coms AND kitchen movies. Guess what? This is both! Sweet story about a chef who lost his way, his rag tag crew, and the restaurant critic who brings him back. Claire Forlani plays an American again, luckily she's much better at the accent than in Mallrats.

Look, this is not groundbreaking cinema but I've watched it at least 3 times already. The kitchen itself seems pretty unrealistic for a pub in an old building but I'm no designer, and the rest of the pub seems pretty authentic.

 It's definitely worth a viewing for anyone who likes restaurant/food movies, with nice shots of English countryside. People in Portland,OR who complain about people moving there may identify with the townsfolk antagonists, so there's something for everyone.",1455667200,,787,4.858208955223881

4459310,2,B004R67RC2,"Just like a dinner that gets cold if left out too long, this film starts out with a good premise (Gordon Ramsey making a non-cooking show, non-angry, appearance), but fizzles out quickly.  Claire Florini, looking a bit like a child of Angelina Jolie & Sandra Bullock put together, just doesn't quite come across as romantically sparky, and somehow the lack of magnetism on the screen carries over into the kitchen.  The cooking looks forced (especially the slow, slow cutting of veggies from this ""professional"" chef) and 400,000 English pounds seems a stiff price to pay for a pub that seats only a dozen or so people (and where this chef wants to open his new 5-star restaurant).  All in all, what begins as a cute story just sort of fizzles out as if the entire meal began to cook deliciously but then someone unknowingly turned off the burner.  Skip this one, and head instead to the wonderful ""Hundred Foot Journey""...you can believe in that one.",1443398400,,951,4.745454545454545

4459338,2,B004R67RC2,"The word that comes to mind here: Unfortunate.

Everything about this film is unfortunate: the acting; the script; the stilted dialogue; the plot holes; the utter lack of comic timing - either in the editing, or in the delivery; the cringe-inducing dearth of any romantic or sexual chemistry whatsoever between the leads. What sounded like a fun, innocuous premise for a rom-com turned into warm bowl of grey, mediocre everything mush after the first 20-30 minutes or so.

One bright spot: unsurprisingly, Simon Callow shows everyone how it's done; it's loads more fun to see him gleefully chomping his way through the scenery than through any of the so-called 'chef' dishes presented, too. Shame nobody else involved picked up acting or comedy pointers, or followed his lead on having a light, deft touch.",1442793600,,806,5.052631578947368

These include going through the grieving process for the loss of a loved one, relationships with friends and family, starting a new life, dealing with the good and the bad from new people, and opening a new business being just a few. I'll keep this short and say this movie is lighthearted and has a good dose of humor in it as well as some fine moments of sadness, anger and even sabotage. Let's not forget the romantic angle, which isn't overdone OR underplayed. Just the right amount of everything, I'd say. I'll be happy to make this a movie to put on my ""once a year watch-list.""

The female lead is American and together bring a serious movie into something that is enjoyable. I don't want to give the movie away. It's a little slow at time and the humor is dry. However it's done well with the cast of supporting actors, one who played the Scotsman in 4 Weddings and Funeral. Brings this about as a fairly good movie.

4459608,1,B004R67RC2,"Okay, so Im a macho kind of guy. Fish, hunt, used to rodeo, but to be honest, hey, yes, I love action packed blood-fest films with large kill-scores and things that blow up but damn, I have to admit, Im also a romantic. Yeah, I was one of those guys who would disguise myself and go off to see every Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks film, and that plethora of Jennifer Anisen, Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock flicks. I guess because I find them hot, and would just love to accidentally spill coffee on them as Im running down a street, and in the last reel, chase them to the airport where I fall to my knees and ask them to marry me. Now, because of the success of the Food Network, Hollywood is also adding kitchens to the mix. I was once a cook, so that only makes it better. There are a ton of these rom-food films now, most of them rather good. However this one, with one of the worse titles in the last fifty years ""Love's Kitchen""  is an abomination. Its made in England, and of course, b being Enlglish myself I think everything from across the pond is better and sometimes thats true. But this was just jaw-dropping bad. It is like the burnt droppings left in the pan that cooked up a Hallmark movie, mixed with something that Lifetime actually threw out, or should I say, threw up. What is stunning is how bad the script is, full of plot holes, and situations that never are tied up. And worse is the direction. I have no idea who this armature is and honestly I have no desire to IMDB him. I mean, he wasted ninety minutes of my time watching his useless drivel, and putting a few minutes into this review, Im not going to take any more time In fact, its not every worth listing his or anyone elses name. There is one wonderful English actor who actually was in some of the top English Rom-coms, playing a TV food critic but he couldn't do a thing to save this, and seems to have walked through this as fast as he could. Its obvious that there was no budget, or if there was, no one, from the DP, to the editor, to basically anyone connect with the film (I mean, I actually noticed how awful the costumes, make-up, sets, etc. were) seemed to give a damn or have the experience or talent to pull off a real live-professional film. Even more astonishing was the food stylist. This is yet another film about a brilliant cook who has dive-bombed, and is brought back by a new women in his life. However, when they try and show him at his best his dishes, and their presentation looks exactly like whats put in front of you at Dennys. No one was thinking. One more thing can we please stop giving our leads that precocious ten-year old daughter? Its either used in rom-coms for heart, or in action films so they get kidnapped. Its getting old. Really, really old. I rented this for something like $2.99 and honestly felt I was robbed! Oh, and there is an American actress in this travesty who should get the award as the 21st Centurys Pia Zadora. I have never, ever seen such an incompetent person trying to act on the screen. Not only cant she show a range of emotion from A to Z, I don't think she can even spell. Truly the worst performance since Pia starred as Girmar in Santa Clause Conquers The Martians.",1435536000,,3203,4.302980132450331

I found myself feeling sorry for the actors who had to say so many embarrassing lines. If the theme of restaurant kitchens, beautiful and delicious food, a personal tragedy, and a blossoming romance is something you are drawn to, look into Mostly Martha starring Martina Gedeck and Sergio Castellito. There will be subtitles, but it doesn't distract from the many enjoyable moments in this film. The acting is skilled and genuine and you won't have to cringe because no one gives anyone a star rating for their performance in bed and you'll be spared the table decorations with chili peppers stuffed in a glass with layers of different colored lentils set out on the tables day after day. By pass No Reservations, go to Ratatouille if you can't face the subtitles, but Mostly Martha is the best one with this kind of story line.

The side characters got a little annoying and the fight between these two was silly and not believable. It's a good thing I had a free rental or I would be sad I spent my money on this.
Sex- Lots of innuendo especially from a nasty guy who had a fling with the girl. Three sex scene one I fast forwarded over because the couple kinda made me sick. The other two just the two of them in bed after talking and kissing.

Written and directed James Hacking, it is a predictable story with a predictable script and put together in a casual way that at least doesn't stir any feathers. Nor does it stir much genuine interest.  It seems like a paste together story for husband/wife team of Dougray Scott and Claire Forlani.

Befuddled Rob Haley (Dougray Scott) was apparently a rising chef in London, put down by food critic Kate Templeton (Claire Forlani), and further distracted by the death of his wife.  In response to the need for change he moves to the country where he finds a pub-like spot in which he decides to create a caf - a truly gourmet spot in the middle of nowhere.  He hires friends to help cook and wait tables.  He garners interest from the townsfolk for his delicious cuisine - especially his 'perfect trifle'.  His efforts do not go unnoticed - Kate Templeton visits, loves the food, and naturally falls in love with Rob... Etc Etc Etc

There is nothing wrong with this bit of British fluff: it just doesn't register on the scale. There are a few sidebars of some note and some cameos by the likes of Simon Callow.

The expressions of sweet innocence that made her appealing when she was younger now make her look dense. There was no chemistry between the leads, which is certain death to a romantic comedy.  I thought this might be a remake of ""No Reservations"" (a really good romantic comedy). It isn't.  The film moved too slowly to enjoy. The dialog was dull and the story was uninspiring. Overall it is a very forgettable film.",1316476800,2,503,4.5777777777777775
8438690,1,B004R67RC2,"Boring and I really love cooking movies, but this one is burnt.  I cannot taste the actor because there is very little.  I guess actors just need to make money, for if there was a script, I sure would not fine myself in this movie.  The Director must be without any passion.  There is nothing here.",1528848000,,298,4.267857142857143

8438693,5,B004R67RC2,Top notch Romcom. Not sure if it was Hallmark (it's sort of like some of their films). This one was quality and enjoyable.  It carried you along with being boring at all. The actors were very real and engaging. The lead male was very attractive in my view. Good story and beautiful cinematography of English countryside.,1523232000,,320,4.714285714285714
8438694,2,B004R67RC2,I couldn't finish this one. The main conflict revolves around an old geezer not liking the fact that a smallish restaurant is popular and therefore creating traffic... how many people could you possibly fit in one pub? He claims his commute was more than doubled but I'm just couldn't buy it which made his predictable attempt to sabotage the place with a fake rodent problem even more tedious than it otherwise would have been. Add to that some silly moments like the main character leaving messages on his dead wife's voicemail and pouring wine in her ashes so she can drink and I turned it off.,1522627200,,597,4.6415094339622645
8438695,5,B004R67RC2,Watched 'Love's Kitchen' for the second time after six years and it was just as charming and delightful the second time around.  Ok.  This movie may not be everyone's cup of tea but it's a nice mix of British and American personalities.  It's a simple romantic comedy.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable and recommend it especially for anyone looking for a light hearted comedy.  Bravo to Amazon Prime video for making this film available.,1522195200,,437,4.851351351351352
8438696,5,B004R67RC2,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! I thought it was going to be just okay, however the more I watched it the more I enjoyed it. I thought it was well rounded and fulled formed plot. There were no plot holes and everything made sense. I appreciated how it started out with a bad kitchen and a good chef who lost his love of cooking. It turned around the typically culinary romcom that has the guy working up to become a great chef. It was a cute movie and had some interesting characters. The guests chefs were a bit contrived, but other than that I really loved this film.",1522108800,,579,4.2727272727272725
8438697,5,B004R67RC2,An actually believable plot with only a slight bit of over the top additions. Good cast. Story is mostly told with solid acting rather than FX.,1519430400,,143,4.538461538461538
8438698,2,B004R67RC2,"Plot was awful, many big continuity errors, bad jokes, overdone characters, lots of things just didn't make sense, but goddam that must have been some amazing trifle. You gotta sell out like that Gordy? Ain't ya got a real job?",1518912000,,227,4.7
8438699,4,B004R67RC2,"It's a cute movie. Is it an Academy Award level movie? No, of course not. But, it was an enjoyable way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon. I liked the concept. The characters were enjoyable. Nothing outstanding, but nothing horrible either. Maybe a little predictable, but that's what I expected. I'd recommend it if you just want to chill out and relax for a bit.",1518825600,,364,4.615384615384615
