8153029,1,B000JUB5NW,"Wow, what a disappointment! We got this because my 6 year old is a zoo nut. We have many other animal/zoo videos and all are VASTLY superior. This dvd looks like some pilot intros to segments of Zoo videos that were never completed. I think there are four, that last about 2 minutes a piece and that's it. We're sending it back, I wouldn't have the heart to sell it on Ebay! Don't waste your money!",1276560000,,398,4.25
