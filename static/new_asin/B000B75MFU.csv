8082706,1,B000B75MFU,"Sometimes it's hard to fathom why someone went to the effort to produce something other than to attempt to cash in. Enter ELVIS: A DOCUMENTARY. The effort put into the production was clearly no greater than the effort put into coming up with an imaginative title. The producers borrow heavily from movie trailers and drop pieces of Elvis' 1968 tv special throughout the program. Bits and pieces of his early tv appearances are included as well. No performances are included in their entirety and curiously, despite the vast majority of Elvis on film being recorded in color - here, the producers offer every second in black and white. The chronology is all over the place and often a bit jarring. The only thing that makes this at all watchable, is Elvis' magnetism. If you are looking for a program to gain an overview of Elvis' life, this is a very poor option. Don't be persuaded by the cheap price. You will be short changing yourself. This video offers nothing new in either information or video footage. It is strictly for the collector who must have every title on the King. You may watch it once, but you won't watch it twice. Following the documentary, there is a section called ""Memorable Moments"", which does feature Elvis' first appearance on the Milton Berle show aboard the USS Hancock including all of Elvis' portion of the show. There are three performances from the 1968 tv special in color, though very poor quality. And Elvis singing American Trilogy from his Aloha from Hawaii concert which was lifted from the Greatest Performances dvd. If you want information on Elvis' life, seek out the movie ""This Is Elvis"", ""He Touched Me"" 2 disc set or ""Elvis 56"" for a great look at the beginning.",1269648000,2,1709,4.738255033557047

Amazon should look at what they are selling. This item dosen't even rate a one star.",1220486400,,289,4.471698113207547
