8311446,3,B001IV618U,"Sherri, I have been holding back from writing this, but honestly, every time I try to look at the dozen or so of your tutorials that I bought here, it is torture, plain and simple.

To give credit where it is due, your information is good and valuable, which is why you are getting any stars at all. This comes from someone normally generous with reviews.

However, the background tune and constantly distracting abstract visuals literally appear to be designed to scramble the little attention I'd like to muster to focus on the information. Moving abstract shapes in kaleidoscope colors, mixed with... what is that... your baby pushing a carriage? My mental CPU is clocked at 100% trying to determine whether to make sense of the nonsense or when I close my eyes, we have the annoying tune as a constant reminder that I have to fight to focus on the information and ignore the fluff.

I bought these many months ago and I am unable to watch through one complete video without screaming and running away 10 minutes into it.

For a tutorial supposed to clarify how to write a film, I cannot possibly imagine how you could have gotten the visual part of your tutorial to be any worse. If this was meant to be an AUDIO course, why not package and sell it as an audio course?

Caveat emptor - buy one, see how you tolerate it, then get the rest of the lessons if you like it, don't jump all in like I did without realizing or anticipating that someone who teaches this stuff can set a new bar for the unwatchable.",1416441600,,1510,4.456521739130435
8311447,5,B001IV618U,"How many times have you watched a film and wanted the lead guy to get wiped out so you would not have to look at him or her anymore? Not if you took this class. I turn to Sherridan's DVDs to help me create diverse characters. This is the most complete segment on character I've ever worked with. She gives you a bunch of ways to design character profiles that seem real and deep and likeable.

All characters need to be likeable and there are lots of ideas here on how to do it. Finding Nemo is talked about in regards to how Pixar gets you to care about a bunch of fish. Once you start watching this class series you see all the things she is talking about in every movie or story.",1277769600,,682,4.08955223880597
