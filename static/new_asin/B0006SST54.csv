8698292,4,B0006SST54,"The Evil One is about a series of murders occurring around the neighborhood of Englewood in Chicago.  These murders seem to be coming from a copycat of H.H. Holmes (or by his other name, Herman Webster Mudgett Jr.) the notorious real life killer in Chicago who was going around killing people in the late 1800's and the World Fair/Columbian Exposition period.  The movie isn't nearly as low budget as the reviews and comments I've seen online suggest, and it actually tells a decent story for the first half.  The second half?  Not nearly as compelling. The problem with the second half of the movie is the lack of suspense or horror.  In fact other than a couple scenes, I wouldn't even label the Evil One as a horror.  It's clearly in the murder/mystery style.

The movie does a pretty good job tricking viewers into not knowing if a copycat murderer is on the loose, or the ghost of H.H. Holmes himself is roaming around the neighborhood doing the killings himself.  On several occasions we see the ghost of H.H. Holmes on the streets, the playground, in a mental hospital, etc.  It's kind of confusing if it's the latter, because the main actress Candace Carey sees this man and gets spooked whereas her daughter either doesn't see or care in one scene later on when he's sitting on the swingset right next to her.

Candace is the best newspaper photographer to take on the murder case.  She and her boyfriend notice a trend in all the murder photos- the victims are lying face down.  She insists on visiting a local mental hospital or prison (not sure which one) where a man escaped and strangled one security guard, and throws acid in the face of another.  Despite her determination to visit this hospital to investigate the murders that took place here and the murders going on around town, she is secretly tormented by one thing- the man who killed her mother is still in jail.  Candace's boyfriend even questions if she's mentally stable enough to visit here in case she sees this man, but she insists she's a grown girl and can handle it.

The story is that H.H. Holmes was buried face down in a casket in the late 1800's which is considered a sign of disrespect.  H.H. takes it personally however.  He put a curse on the 13 men who buried him like this, but he's not all bad, since the myth goes that if one of the family members/descendants of the 13 men who buried him were to flip his body over so he's facing up, he will remove the curse for all the family descendants.  At least his spirit is willing to forgive, hehe.

The movie is only mildly interesting as it chugs along.  We often see the ghost of H.H. Holmes wandering around, but for the longest time we aren't sure if this spirit is doing the killing, or channeling another man to do the killings.  Halfway through Candace's daughter is kidnapped.  When this moment arrives, this is when the story really begins to drag.  We see Candace visit a spiritual adviser/soul warrior.  She's someone who can sense spirits between this world and the dark side.  She can use her energy to find Candace's daughter.  Candace discovers this woman walking by her house right after Candace's grandmother walks outside screaming that her granddaughter is missing.  This spiritual adviser lady recommends seeking a certain older lady who knows about the Englewood killer, and recommends Candace tell this woman about the man/spirit she saw.  So far, kind of interesting.  Candace visits this older lady.  The lady says her husband's grandfather is H.H. Holmes himself.

The story really drags after this.  It's also when Deon Cole's cop character arrives on the scene.  He and Candace go around looking for clues related to her missing daughter, and they have boring conversations with each other.  Candace visits people around town, including the church, and the whole time I couldn't help but think Candace's sadness for her kidnapped daughter had almost become an afterthought.  She stopped caring or showing emotion for her daughter which was weird to see.  There's another strange scene that involves a man wearing a yellow shirt running into an abandoned building late at night.  Three men run after him leading to a shootout and an unintentional death of this yellow shirted man.  Meanwhile the main characters -mainly Candace and Deon- discuss the killer.

The ending isn't too great.  SPOILERS!  Turns out that older snotty lady who's related to H.H. Holmes is the one who kidnapped Candace's daughter.  The curse lives on through her apparently.  She also ties Deon down to a bed and has Candace at her mercy for a while.  The old lady plans to kill everyone before Candace's boyfriend is able to stop all this madness just in time and save their kidnapped daughter who's hiding in a back room.  I don't get what happens before the credits.  Deon's saved and lying in bed recovering.  Candace walks to the bathroom after having a conversation with the spiritual adviser lady and then... her eyes get demented.  Everyone's like ""What's wrong Candace!"" but the movie ends.  There's a few ways to interpret this, but I don't know which one it is.

There is one really disturbing moment.  It's when a little girl stands up as part of her school assignment and, in an evil voice, says ""My great grandmother says she does not want me to die like my mommy's mom"".  The teacher gets concerned and asks the girl what she's saying and who she's looking at as the little girl looks outside the window.  The girl says ""a friend"" but the teacher says she doesn't see anyone.  The girl doesn't know her name but says she's a nice lady.  When the teacher takes a look out the window herself  she sees a ghostly figure of a woman standing on the ground below (that spiritual adviser lady).  In the next scene the little girl's on a swing, and the ghost of H.H. Holmes appears beside her.  Like I say above, I don't know if the girl is able to see him or not.  The movie doesn't really indicate she can, and only Candace's character can see him.

I would recommend this movie though.  The acting's better than people have been telling me, and the story's at least decent despite being confusing in a couple spots.  On a side note there was an instrumental song that played near the beginning.  For half the movie I was struggling to identify where I heard a similar melody before.  I finally got it- it reminds me of a song from the Who's Quadrophenia.",1500249600,,6402,4.659821428571429
