Especially the bad guys when they are in pursuit of the ""Ballbuster"". You can tell a lot of the actors are locals that just want to make it in the industry, or friend of the people making the movie. But it's a fun watch. I suggest the beginning of the movie, when the two guys in the apartment stand in the doorway looking for a shot, but end up looking like they're dancing. HILARIOUS!",1295740800,2,543,4.037037037037037
