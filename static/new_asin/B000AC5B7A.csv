2829175,2,B000AC5B7A,I couldn't understand what they were saying half the time.  There was so much mumbling.  Some of today's actors need dialog coaches.  Do you notice that in the newer movies?  It can be hard to understand what the actor's are saying regardless of volume.,1460678400,,253,4.681818181818182

2829374,3,B000AC5B7A,"As movies about the Mexican drug war go, this isn't a bad little movie, but for some reason, it just didn't grab me. It has some twists and its heart is in the right place (I think) but honestly I liked Oliver Stone's Savages better (and I don't think its heart was in the right place!) Go figure!  If you like Jeff Daniels then check this video out. Spader has a fairly minor role and I do like that there is at least one HIspanic character who has a real role in the film (other than playing a sleazy gangster.)",1353888000,4,513,4.13

2829376,4,B000AC5B7A,"This is a mystery-thriller that is also an expose. The viewer is taken South of the border and shown what goes on when business, American interests and local politics don't mesh as well as some would like.

Two young men are doing some off-road biking in Mexico. They are murdered for no apparent reason. 27 people are found dead in a tunnel under Tijuana. Is there a connection? And if so, what is it?

Jeff Daniels is a civil rights rep in town to see that the upcoming union elections at an American owned factory are on the up and up. James Spader is with the Justice department to see that American interests are upheld and Portia de Rossi is with the U.S. Trade Department as an impartial observer. Cliff Collins is a clean cop investigating the deaths of the 27 victims. The lives of all four intertwine as the story gets thicker.

This is some ugly stuff. There is an unbelievable level of crime and corruption at nearly every turn and it makes you sick. To see so many lives forfeit for stupidity and greed is too much to bare. Rowdy Herrington does a great job of directing it all. And this is no high budget, flashy Hollywood stuff. It's done in a very plain, lo-fi style to let the story speak for itself. You love these characters. Daniels is in a tough spot dealing with powers that do not want the factory unionized, but he doesn't back down. He's in their face at every turn. Spader likes Daniels but their jobs are at odds with each other and this won't end well. De Rossi thinks she's doing well but comes to realize that this is a lot bigger than she is and she doesn't like that realization. Collins wants to paint by numbers and file a report but his conscience gets the better of him.

This is great stuff told in a great way. The ending doesn't ring true, because sometimes the bad guys DO win but it makes the viewer feel better to see it this way. This is a smart script driving a smart movie with a great and real feel to it. If you like this sort of thing, you'll love this.",1316390400,2,2001,4.29973474801061
2829377,4,B000AC5B7A,"This review is for the AMAZON VOD rental of this film. This is a good thriller
about the exploitation of workers in Mexico. Good, well paced story with nice
work from the actors. Jeff Daniels, James Spader and Portia de Rossi are very
good but Clifton Collins Jr. steals the show playing a honest Mexican policeman.
This film is well worth the VOD rental price.",1290384000,10,361,4.569230769230769

2829379,4,B000AC5B7A,"This is a compact, competent and criminally underrated drama about the complicated affairs of our nearest neighbor. Jeff Daniels - expert as always - is a Human Rights observer sent to monitor the unionization of an American corporation in Mexico. ""First they moved us to Tennessee,"" a factory foreman complains. ""Then they moved us here. My wife wouldn't come.""  James Spader works for the US State Department, which doesn't seem to do much - even in the face of policemen beating up strikers. Two missing American motorcyclists and a collapsed tunnel full of bodies are part of the mystery. Don't make up your mind until you've seen it all. Solid and absorbing.",1210291200,38,663,4.919642857142857

8194016,5,B000AC5B7A,"I stopped watching this to research the subject a little. Here's an article title from PRI.org on this very current issue: ""Workers in Mexico's border factories say they can barely survive, so they're turning to unions""

In the article was this statement: ""A study by the Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness at the University of Texas at El Paso shows factory wages in Jurez are among the lowest in Mexico, and plant manager salaries are among the highest.""

Here is an example of what the article is talking about: ""You can't live on our salaries,"" says Brenda Estrada, a former employee of one border manufacturer, the American telecommunications giant CommScope. ""You just survive."" Estrada says she was spending half of her $7/day salary on wood to keep her cinderblock home heated.

Time to write to Mr Trump and suggest (demand?) that American companies be required to pay their employees in other countries a living wage. If these companies are moving to save wages, then compel them to not starve their employees, just so they can report higher profits to their stockholders.

OK. Back to the movie. Jeff Daniels just got clobbered. Am I the only one who still thinks of him as Will McAvoy every time I see him in film? :)",1517097600,,1236,4.816037735849057

8194020,3,B000AC5B7A,"The good:
Good acting, great cinematography, good action, lots of surprises and plot twists.  The opening minutes are dynamite.  Really captured the feeling of Tijuana.
The bad:
A couple of very poor directing/writing decisions: 1. Main character, who supposedly has spent years working with various human rights issues and groups, is painfully unaware of the existence of agents provocateurs, who were made so obvious in the movie that a six-year-old could see it.  2. Father of murdered youth seem unable to reach the obvious conclusion that his son may have seen some illicit actions that caused him to be killed.
Major plot/story flaw: the main ""good guys"" are in the hands of sociopathic killers and are being forced to dig their own grave.  Suddenly with no explanation or motive, they are freed and given a car to drive away in.  This is a hole you could drive a truck through and destroys the believability of the movie.  From then on, you're watching it just to see how it turns out.",1497225600,,992,4.805882352941176
8194021,5,B000AC5B7A,"I almost did not watch this movie due to the negative comments; but I have always enjoyed Spader and Daniels so went ahead, and so glad I did.  This is a fictional scenario that is entertaining.  It has twists and turns so you are NOT going to know who did what, who is on what side of the law, etc.  There is minimal Spanish without subtitles that will not affect your understanding, and subtitles are provided where needed.  People are shot but they don't harp on details of gore, nor much in the way of vulgarities, nor sex - your kids could watch it.  I shake my head in bewilderment at the negativity and am guessing people want to come across as some awesome movie critic and literary author, sigh.  It's basic plot is realistic, it stays interesting, Daniels and Spader are great as expected, so just watch it and enjoy it for what it is: an entertaining, fictional, movie.",1494806400,5,880,4.46875
