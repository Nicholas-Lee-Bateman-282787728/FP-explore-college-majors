In case you missed it ... `One, Two, Many'
Posted by Scott on May 12, 2008

You can go through at most big chain video stores and see about 15 different `National Lampoon Presents' movies and a couple of things you are guaranteed: they are typically really Low Budget, and the comedy will be hit or miss. As of 2007 National Lampoon decided to start putting out its own movies again, and this is one of the first that it has done. I was actually quite surprised by it.

The movie stars John Melendez(who also wrote, and produced) which you probably only know him as Stuttering John from the Howard Stern Show. Well this is his first major gig as an actor and I must say I was pretty impressed with him. Some of the jokes were a little cheesy, but i think they were meant to be.

The story is centered around Thomas(Melendez) who is an out of work actor trying to find the right woman. The only problem is he definition of said woman. He wants to find one that doesnt have a problem bringing other women to bed. As most guys already know, this isn't usually an option. You watch him go on date after date with women and doesnt find the one that fits the mold. He gets a temporary acting gig where he meets Jennifer(played by the sexy Bellamy Young) and he explains what he is looking for to her. She seemed into it, and they launched a relationship. Eventually they try out their first threesome with a high priced prostitute, which goes awry when he has to make several trips to the ATM. Eventually they meet a singer and the threesome was successful, but with anything it was too good to be true. Jennifer's insecurities come out and things hit the fan.

The movie has its moments, especially scenes with Jefferey Ross, who plays the best friend role. Its definitely worth renting if you are in the mood for a sexy, low budget-ish comedy, I wish it had gotten more press. I guess thats the case with any National Lampoon movie as of late.",1210636800,2,1946,4.379501385041551

One, Two, Many... Is Hilarious

""It's hilarious"" One Two Many delivers comedy with greatness
Reviewed by:  Graphic News / Writer Hannah Erickson

When I received the press release and a copy of the National Lampoon presents One, Two, Many for my review.  I was both surprised an intrigued.  I knew that Mr. Melendez had made a career change, and was now the announcer on The Jay Leno show.  What I did not know was Mr. Melendez had a movie coming out, let alone was the star, writer, and producer of the movie.  As a journalist I was never a big fan of the Howard Stern show.  I never really listened enough to understand the dynamic or have an extreme like or dislike for the show until the Gennifer Flowers interview.  That was by far one of the most incredibly courageous and enjoyable pieces of media I have ever scene, and my first introduction to John Melendez, known to most of the world as ""Stuttering John"".

I decided to do a little research on Mr. Melendez.  To my surprise I found out that along with his higher publicized accomplishments such as Stern & Leno, Mr. Melendez was a graduate of NYU film school, and key note speaker for the National Stuttering Association.  Who knew?

I popped in the DVD.

At first I was a bit confused, before I got to the menu options I sat through what seemed to be a extra long set of trailers for upcoming and past National Lampoon films.  I suggest you fast forward through them.

One Two Many is set in NYC,  and takes the viewers on a journey of a man named Thomas who is played by John Melendez, Thomas is on a mission to find the woman of his dreams or shall I say to find a woman that could make his dream come true.

You are first introduced to Thomas (John Melendez) in his  therapists office played by the very funny JM J. Bullock.  Thomas clearly troubled dives right into to his session. If he could just find one woman that would be ok with allowing him to sleep with other woman all of his problems would be solved.  As a woman this comes as no surprise to me. This is every man's fantasy.  Right?  I clear my head from any chauvinistic feelings I might have, and remind myself this is a movie and this is his dream not mine.  I continue to watch and within seconds I have the first of many laughs.
I find it  quite refreshing that the writer gets directly to the  point tells us what the objective is and in this case takes on his hilarious journey full of laughs, sentiment, and triumph.  It left me wanting more.

I applaud Mr. Melendez for that.  Frankly most movies I see take forever to set up the most predictable story line.  Especially comedies.  One Two Many....  get's directly to the point, and does it with greatness.  Not only did I laugh, but I experienced all kinds of emotion, and compassion for the lead character Thomas.  First I hated him , Then I loved him, Then I felt bad for him.  By the end of the film I genuinely was routing for him to have a threesome.  What?  Did I actually just write that?

This movie is funny well written, and directed.  The cast is full of talent.  Stand outs are John Melendez, JM J. Bullock, Bellamy Young, and Jeffery Ross.

Over all Rating:  A
If you love to laugh and are looking for a great comedy, see this film.

National Lampoon used to put out some good movies, I don't know what happened to them, but there is a reason why this went straight to DVD.

Plus, can someone tell me what Stuttering John does on the Leno show.  I betcha Leno could shot himself for hiring this talentless hack.  It goes to show what talent Stern has if he could take this hack and make him amusing.",1208476800,17,712,4.229629629629629

You guys had it made on the Stern show because he carried all of you.  Your day in the sun is LONG gone.  Don't think you have any talent to do anything else but act as the stuttering buffoon John...that is all you are capable of.

8252588,2,B0013PVGMM,"I've been a fan of Howard Stern's shows on TV and radio, so when I came across ONE, TWO, MANY at my local video store, I decided to see what Stern's sidekick ""Stuttering John"" is up to these days (he seems to have cured his stuttering, by the way). I noticed that John had written the screenplay himself, and while I found the idea of the movie to be worthwhile (don't mess up your relations with your girlfriend by trying threesomes), really the script to this needed substantial polishing by some accomplished screenwriter(s). As I watched the movie I felt like I was watching an amateur production, although unlike some reviewers I thought the acting in this was decent. There are some funny scenes and lines, like the one where John and his GF had called in a hooker to be their threesome partner, but as the hooker kept upping the price John had to keep going to the nearest ATM machine to get more cash, and obstacles kept slowing down the return to his apartment. What was most puzzling to me was the lack of eye candy in this movie. There are several hot babes in it for sure, but there is only one brief nude scene (about 1 minute) as John visits a strip club. Beyond that nudity is obviously avoided, such as when said hooker (played by the bodacious Sandra Taylor) comes over and everyone strips, but the ladies don't even get topless!! Geez, were they trying to appease the far right or something?? Overall, I was very disappointed with ONE, TWO, MANY, and in fact I've been disappointed with most National Lampoon movies in recent years.",1293926400,,1550,4.539285714285715

8252590,1,B0013PVGMM,"While John Melendez is not a particularly good actor (he seems to have the screen presence of a squirrel), this is still a movie with a few funny parts here & there.  Bellamy Young has far better acting skills than Melendez, and she also seems to be too much of a sophisticate for this movie.  That, of course, makes her perfect as the role of the g/f who is open to F/F/M threesomes.  I've always been a fan of Hudson Leick's ever since her recurring portrayal of Callisto on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xena-Warrior-Princess-Complete-Series-Seasons-1-6/dp/B0007DA3VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xena Warrior Princess - Complete Series (Seasons 1-6)</a>.

So, with all that said, why am I hammering this movie so hard with just 1 star?  Well, the answer is pretty basic:  it seems that National Lampoon simply doesn't understand its client base.  With an NL movie with threesomes as the subject matter, one would expect (if not demand!) a great deal of gratuitous nudity.  I mean, if you can't make a movie like this w/out excuses for having a slew of topless babes, then what is the point?

Instead, this movie strikes out altogether in this department.  In the climactic scene in which he gets this threesome wish, the girls only strip down to their underwear.  How lame is THAT?  Basically, this film is something like a Corvette with a Yugo engine.  Sure, it looks good on the cover, but....

The sad thing is, this could have been a terrific movie.  The concept was sound and the subject matter could easily be used for myriad humorous situations.  This is one of those NL movies that had potential, but ended up being half-baked.

8252591,1,B0013PVGMM,"This was the worst National lampoons movie ever. If Stuttering John thinks this is gonna create an up and coming film career, he's got another thing coming. The acting is horrible and you can predict how each scene is going to turn out. They should show this movie at film school as ""How not to make a movie"". Shame on you John.",1237420800,4,328,4.306451612903226
8252592,1,B0013PVGMM,"Does John Melendez really think people were interested him as an actor? ""Many"" is a disquieting testament to Melendez's massive ego, for he not only acts, but scripts, produces, executive produces, and writes/performs about half of the soundtrack. Impressive feats, until you find out just how dreadful ""Many"" is.

""One, Two, Many"" is atrociously unfunny and Melendez reveals himself to be a man of zero charisma and artistic capability.

The director here is actor Michael DeLorenzo (""New York Undercover""), and I use the term ""director"" ironically, since there's nothing in this film actually being led. Essentially a vessel for Melendez to remind the world how hilarious he thinks he is, DeLorenzo's sole job appears to be making sure the camera is in focus. Even that is a challenge during the film. Why Melendez didn't direct the picture himself is mystery, since the movie is a love letter to his talents (or lack thereof). Perhaps blocking a scene while also having to dream up new ways to mug shamelessly for the camera would've been too much for Melendez to juggle.

The pain starts with opening titles no more impressive than the introduction to grandma's vacation video and extends to: Thomas calling his genitalia a ""vagining rod,"" an unintentionally hilarious sequence where Thomas defends the local stutterer from bullies, an embarrassing cameo from Mark Cuban, the use of what looks like ""Tonight Show"" offices to sub for apartment and hotel hallways, and an extended straining-on-toilet diarrhea gag that accurately sums up both John Melendez's talents and the film's vast ambitions.

In fact, ""Many"" is packed with unimaginative, juvenile humor. ""Many"" is pointlessly crude; Melendez has no actual perceivable wit, so he uses fecal jokes and sexual come-ons to cover the script's dead spots. It's a curious choice because the screenplay eventually attempts to provoke sympathy, leaving the weird vulgarity up there with other unexplained touches like: the brief use of animation to embellish Thomas's fantasy world, why Melendez thought anyone would want to watch a film where he's cast as an object of sexual desire, and why his character wears a strange, unexplained frizzy wig.

FINAL THOUGHTS

What really irritated me about ""Many"" wasn't the rampant stupidity and laziness of the endeavor; with Melendez's participation, that was to be expected. Rather, it's how the film wants the audience to care about these characters in the final reel. It's screenwriting 101 at its most obvious. After 70 minutes of sex jokes, lousy (if present at all) production values, and a moment where Thomas wipes his rear with money after a potent bathroom engagement, I think it's insulting to ask the viewer to give a damn about the psychological damage inflicted on these idiot characters. But then again, this is a film that believes seeing John Melendez naked is a concentrated strike of hilarity, so clearly ""One, Two, Many"" was doomed from the start.
