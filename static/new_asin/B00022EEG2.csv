8020460,5,B00022EEG2,"This is my second purchase to give to a friend. I encourage anyone who really wants to look good and feel great to use this video.  It takes commitment to trust Leslie Sansone's promise to firm off the weight through the Walk Off Weight video series.  Three separate simple 20 minute workouts that build strength and reduce bulk can be added to a Walk Off Weight cardio video.  This is a full, at home, low cost, total fitness program leading to good health and total fitness.  Strength training burns stored fat and along with a healthy food plan, contributes to weight loss.  If you are committed to getting healthy, this video series is the one to use.",1431648000,,655,4.564102564102564
8020461,5,B00022EEG2,I had this same workout in VHS and have been searching for the DVD. So glad to have found it.,1366761600,,93,3.7
8020462,4,B00022EEG2,"easy to follow ... some of her comments, like ""now that's not so hard"", would be better left unsaid.  I have several other dvds and they are all helpful",1330041600,,152,4.241379310344827
8020463,5,B00022EEG2,"This is one of my favorite DVD's of hers. It's got three 20 minute strength training segments that are low impact but a very effective workout. Most of the exercises are with hand weights but you don't need them. The exercises are basic, easy to follow, and very effective.",1242518400,,273,4.591836734693878
8020464,5,B00022EEG2,"Great workout for firming. Many options to choose from for target area firming, or play the whole program",1148688000,4,105,4.888888888888889
8020465,1,B00022EEG2,"First of all, there is no walking in this video, so to have ""Walk"" in the title is a bit misleading.  There are three toning segments that are about 20 minutes apiece, and there is no warm-up or stretching afterwards.  With so many great toning videos out there, don't waste your money on this one.",1139529600,7,298,4.4
8020466,4,B00022EEG2,"I think this is a great tape for toning. The segments really pack a lot of exercises into 20 minutes. Coupled with an aerobic exercise, this is really shaping me up. Leslie does jabber on a bit -- but she leads a good workout.",975801600,12,226,4.159090909090909
8020467,1,B00022EEG2,"This video was poor enough to motivate me to warn other users about its content.  The video does not include warm ups, cool downs, stretching of any kind or complete instruction regarding the correct form to be used  during the exercise.  In fact, during some segments such as the outer thigh  workout in Segment #3, the improper form is demonstrated.  The range of  exercises is minimal. Even if all three segments are completed, exercises  for the back, calves and quadriceps are missing.  There are too many good  videos to waste time or money on this one.",947376000,52,559,4.739583333333333
