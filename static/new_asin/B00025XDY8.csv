2063285,4,B00025XDY8,"Miel para Och&uacute;n es una pel&iacute;cula entretenida (y a veces c&oacute;mica) de la b&uacute;squeda de ra&iacute;ces familiares y las angustias causadas por la separaci&oacute;n. Es una pel&iacute;cula que se centra en las aflicciones del (otro) cubano; es decir, el cubano que por no haber crecido en su pa&iacute;s de origen, no lo conoce. El protagonista de esta historia es Roberto Delgado (Jorge Perugorr&iacute;a), un cubano criado en los Estados Unidos. Cuando triunf&oacute; la revoluci&oacute;n castrista, su padre decidi&oacute; fugarse del pa&iacute;s llev&aacute;ndose a su &uacute;nico hijo, apenas siendo un ni&ntilde;o. Como muchos cubanos americanos, Roberto creci&oacute; con una doble identidad, sinti&eacute;ndose cubano por su herencia &eacute;tnica, pero a la vez americano por haberse criado en su nuevo pa&iacute;s adoptivo. &Eacute;ste conflicto que Roberto lleva por dentro no lo deja descansar y despu&eacute;s de la muerte de su padre, quien siempre le prohib&iacute;a regresar a su pa&iacute;s natal, Roberto decide volver al pa&iacute;s que anhela y buscar la madre que presumiblemente lo abandon&oacute;. Con la ayuda de su prima Pilar (Isabel Santos) quien no ve en muchos a&ntilde;os y un taxista interesado solamente en ganar dinero, Roberto se embarca en un viaje que lo llevar&iacute;a a cruzar la isla entera, desde La Habana hasta Baracoa. Desv&iacute;os, acontecimientos desdichados y personajes extra&ntilde;os son algunos de los acontecimientos que adelantan la historia de esta pel&iacute;cula y le dan cierta cualidad encantadora.

El director Humberto Sol&aacute;s tambi&eacute;n incluye en muchas de las escenas taxistas particulares en carros americanos antiguos, la mezcla racial de la gente que constituye la poblaci&oacute;n cubana, apagones el&eacute;ctricos y hasta una ceremonia santera. Todas siendo cosas muy ubicuas en la sociedad cubana y cosas que un cubano regresando a su pa&iacute;s encontrar&iacute;a.

El problema que le da caso a los que critican la pel&iacute;cula como obra propagandista, es que, aunque la pel&iacute;cula se basa en la experiencia de un cubano regresando a su pa&iacute;s de origen y las cosas que encuentra, curiosamente en ning&uacute;n momento se puede ver carteles con la imagen del Che o Castro. Gente de vigilancia, tiendas sin mercanc&iacute;a o las inmensas colas de repartos alimentarios, tampoco se encuentran en ning&uacute;n instante. El padre que decidi&oacute; emigrar es secuestrador y mentiroso y los cubanos que se quedaron en la isla, son moralmente m&aacute;s ilustrados. Quiz&aacute;s era la meta de Sol&aacute;s representar el sufrimiento que acompa&ntilde;a la inmigraci&oacute;n, sin el elemento pol&iacute;tico. Pero, all&iacute; mismo es donde err&oacute;, porque la pol&iacute;tica es fundamental en lo que se refiere al problema cubano. Hoy en d&iacute;a no hay problema, con respecto a los cubanos, que no tenga algo que ver con la pol&iacute;tica. La raz&oacute;n por las separaciones familiares, el continuo sufrimiento de la poblaci&oacute;n cubana y la fuente del odio cubano, todos est&aacute;n enraizados en la pol&iacute;tica. Tambi&eacute;n, el hecho de que muchos cubanos prefieran tirarse a la merced del mar, aunque les pueda costar la vida.

Pero para juzgar esta pel&iacute;cula justamente, hay que tomar en cuenta las limitaciones econ&oacute;micas y de libertad que existen en Cuba. A causa de semejantes limitaciones, las pel&iacute;culas cubanas suelen centrarse m&aacute;s en di&aacute;logos que son favorables para el gobierno. Y esta pel&iacute;cula sigue esa misma tradici&oacute;n. Aparte del protagonista narrando sus reflexiones sentimentales durante gran parte de la pel&iacute;cula, hay varios di&aacute;logos que suceden en lenguaje simple pero a la vez atrayente. Tambi&eacute;n hay m&aacute;s discusiones francas sobre la situaci&oacute;n en la isla sin la cr&iacute;tica al gobierno que suelen ocurrir en pel&iacute;culas de otros pa&iacute;ses.

En fin, para el aficionado del cine latino en general y los que est&aacute;n interesados en saber m&aacute;s de la experiencia cubano americana en particular, vale la pena ver esta pel&iacute;cula. El tema de la situaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica cubana y el no conocer nuestras ra&iacute;ces es algo que agita y desespera a mucha gente. Ojal&aacute; un d&iacute;a se pueda tener una discusi&oacute;n libre y civilizada sobre la cuesti&oacute;n cubana; pero mientras llega ese d&iacute;a, tal vez pel&iacute;culas como &eacute;sta ayuden llevarle un poco m&aacute;s de comprensi&oacute;n a los que no la tienen.",1140220800,,4602,5.905405405405405
2063286,5,B00025XDY8,"I disagree with the post that this movie is sending a political statement.  Growing up in Miami and later venturing to different parts of the US, I feel I present a fairly balanced political view with regards to Cuba.  While it can be argued that the film is pro-Castro, I think it the opposite could be argued as well.

Also note that the characters clearly state that neither side is to blame and that this family was simply victims of the political climate of the times.

As a Cuban-American, I can honestly say this is the most objective film I've seen on the subject (and that is HARD TO FIND!).  It's true focus is on a beautiful yet painful story of a torn family and incidentally the heartfelt kindness and warmth that I honestly feel is plentiful in Cuba.

You can accuse me of being political (as I'm sure some fellow C-A will) but this is DEFINITELY a film that should be seen by anyone interested in learning about Cubans and Cuban-Americans.  I went through a very similar experience when I made my first trip to Cuba in 2000.....

Enjoy this film...",1106870400,8,1063,4.5
2063287,1,B00025XDY8,"Poor directing, terrible acting, dismal filming (hand-held camera resulting in jittery scenes) unconvincing characters and a disguised political agenda make this the worst Cuban film I've had the agony of sitting through. Jorge Perugorr&iacute;a was great in ""Strawberry and Chocolate"" but his performance is dismal in this film. His character is simply not believable as a Cuban American returning to his country of birth as a man looking for his mother after being ""abducted"" by his father as a child, and raised in Miami.

Jorge Perugorr&iacute;a's character Roberto, with the aid of his cousin Pilar (played by Isabel Santos) and taxi driver Antonio (Mario Limonta) undertake a road trip across Cuba to find his long lost mother. With little to go on, except some old photographs and the revelations of a ""santera"" who tells him that his mother can be found where Och&uacute;n, (correct spelling) orisha of rivers whose offerings include honey, meets Yemay&aacute;, orisha of the ocean, Roberto's determination to find his mother is put to the test.

Although very few pro-government billboards with pictures of Castro and Ch&eacute; are shown, (they are ubiquitous in Cuba) this movie is just another pro-Castro political statement aimed at Cubans inside the island desperate to leave the country. The film makes a poor attempt to sell the idea that no matter how bad the internal situation is, and no matter how hopeless life may seem, it is better to stay and live under these hardships rather than break up the family by emigrating.

Don't waste your time or money on this movie. In my opinion it's not worth the celluloid it was printed on.",1102377600,2,1649,5.055147058823529
2063288,4,B00025XDY8,"Miel Para Oshun is at times poignant with the rediscovery of a Cuban migr's past and at times comical when vehicle after vehicle breaks down.  In Spanish with English subtitles, the film shows some of the pains and difficulties created by separations due to Cuba's political history.  It also has a strong sense of community as whole villages turn out to watch shouting matches between two of the principal characters, and people cram onto the backs of trucks to ride between towns.  A friend of mine asked ""is Cuba really like that?"" after watching the film, referring to the realistic depiction of towns and travel.  So for some, this film can serve as an introduction to what for some is the mysterious island just to the south.",1093478400,2,731,4.732283464566929
8022587,5,B00025XDY8,"It's a beautiful story. Very close to reality specially for the cubans, like me, who lived enough time there to be familiar to most of the situations shown in the movie. It makes you smile and even laugh and sometimes it makes you cry or get close to do it.
I had this movie in VHS and we lost it. That's why I made this purchase through Amazon which makes the system work efficiently until you receive whatever you purchase. The only thing I regret is that the colors in the DVD are not as bright as in the VHS. But it is good enough. I am happy because I recovered this story",1413504000,,577,4.115044247787611
8022588,5,B00025XDY8,This is now my favorite movie of all time.  An amazing journey both inside and through Cuba with a returned native son.,1391990400,,119,4.409090909090909
8022589,5,B00025XDY8,"This movie is a good approach to cuban reality and the reality of inmigration as well. The actors are great, the plot is developed with certain sarcasm combined with drama. The movie is a mixtures of comedy and sentimentalism, you laugh many times but you can cry also.",1366416000,,269,4.625
8022590,4,B00025XDY8,"""On the road"" in Cuba. A nice sentimental journey with lots of traveler's problems to keep it interesting and underscore the harness of traveling in a rather undeveloped country. A pleasant peek into some Cuban lives and that touched on the emotional conflicts in someone (Cuban raised in Miami) who had been detached from his roots.

I wish we had seen more variety of the landscape, but still it was good. I also wish that the print had been better and the subtitles more clear, but that was acceptable.

I think it stayed away from politics, contrary to some comments here. Cuba was presented as very poor, but there was no blaming either of the US or of the Castro government. It stayed focused on the characters and the atmosphere of the road.",1360022400,,748,4.616541353383458
8022591,5,B00025XDY8,"A strongly poignant reflection of the profound dislocation of identity brought on by the Cuban diaspora felt on both sides of the Florida Straits.  Surprisingly, the film exposes many of Cuba's unresolved personal and economic privations. The Castro message is present, but the human drama of reconciliation -- internal and external -- has a much more powerful draw.  Next to the Cuban-american character of Roberto (Jorge Perugorri'a), Pilar (Isabel Santos) is extraordinary as a soft-spoken bourgeois and highly educated yet emotionally damaged Cuban.  Forced to give up painting in censorship-driven Cuba, the artist learns to survive as a restoration expert after her own parents chose to stay rather than be exiled following the Revolution. Pilar is central to Roberto's story and the island's drama.  The insertion of humor in the midst of grave difficulties is very well crafted through superb dialogue. Overall, the movie is staged like a slowly emerging memory. We are likely to see more of these types of films in the future but ""Miel para Oshu'n"" will remain a trailblazer.

Cuba's first digital film in collaboration with Canal + (France) and Rtve(Spain).  Difficult and maybe heart-wrenching to watch for those of us who have lived the drama in and out of Cuba and later within the United States.",1335657600,4,1309,5.180094786729858
8022592,4,B00025XDY8,"I thought this was an excellent movie.  It was slow moving and exasperating as the journey the young man took on with his cousin and the taxi driver was slow moving and exasperating.  I don't know anything about Cuba but I suspect it portrays the people and the way they are.  It also shows how living under this government certainly has the effect of making everything more difficult in terms of the conveniences we have here in the States.  The people seem to have a capacity to care for and be happy for the son and mother, etc.  You can feel the pain of them both having lived without each other.  I think the movie was very realistic and I believe that such emotional people would go through the very thing the mother and son went through.  I'm glad for the happy ending.",1331337600,2,776,4.384615384615385
8022593,4,B00025XDY8,"This movie is somewhat slow moving and has a predictable outcome, but it gives many good insights into the difficulties of living in Cuba in about 2005.  The people along the way are very believable and the countryside and city scenes are real.  If you have been to Cuba or are thinking of going this is a great review or introduction.",1330646400,,335,4.475409836065574
8022594,5,B00025XDY8,"Excellent movie...supert acting by the 3 principal actors.  This movie will make you laugh and cry ( both ).  It's about a man who embarks on a long journey....with 2 friends....to try to find his long lost mother...that he has been separated from since childhood.  There's a fantastic musical score, excellent acting, love, sadness...everything...in this movie.  The movie also shows excellent scenes of Cuba and the people who live there.  A must see movie...and one everyone should own...as you may want to watch it over and over again.  I bought this movie at Amazon.com...for 49 cents.  Unbelievable...a steal!  It came to me quickly...within a few days.",1289692800,3,659,5.150943396226415

However, if you want to see a movie that is full of warmth then you should see it. Be advised however, this is not a movie produced with world class camera equipment.
