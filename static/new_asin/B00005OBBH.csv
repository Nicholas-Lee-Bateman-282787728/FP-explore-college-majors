8212908,5,B00005OBBH,"When I first heard this CD I was amazed, again, at the levels of intimacy and soul searching Buckley achieved.  And, when the DVD arrived, it confirmed my initial thoughts.  With this act, she seems to be at the top of her game.  That was then:  she's had several peaks since this time (1967 and Quintessence) and will continue I hope.  Please add this to your Buckley collection - you will not be disappointed.",1240012800,,411,4.5
8212909,2,B00005OBBH,"Betty's voice is still strong and beautiful but arrangements of most beloved songs are simply horrible.

If you prefer traditional versions this concert is not for you.

The quality of image and sound is very good.

Can be recommended only to hardcore fans.",1096502400,5,257,4.930232558139535
8212910,5,B00005OBBH,"I gave the CD and DVD of Stars and the Moon to a friend, who is also a theater director at the University of the Philippines.  He is the one who introduced me to Betty Buckley.  We both watched it and have the same reaction towards the DVD.  It is very touching and an emotional experience, especially for us who are fans of Betty Buckley.  I first heard her Carnegie performance on CD and ever since became a big fan of hers.  However, to see her perform is another experience.  I must admit that some of the songs here are unfamiliar. However, Betty Buckley performed it in such a way that the songs are transformed into monologues.  It is as if she is speaking to her audience.  For instance, her take on ""Stars and the Moon"" is really definitive.  Some would claim that Audra McDonald's version is the best.  Having heard both version, on the audio alone, the bittersweet and irony of the song is perfectly delivered by Betty Buckley.  She is a very relaxed singer.  One could see that she does not only sing.  The lyrics seem not memorized but appear to be thought spontaneously by the singer.  She is a real storyteller on all those songs.  This is highly recommended.",1074816000,7,1174,4.471698113207547
8212911,3,B00005OBBH,"I love Betty Buckley... and all her incarnations.  However, I have found myself enjoying this dvd with the tv off...
There are some garish close-ups that would be unflattering to anyone.  Kenny is a wonderful musical director and pianist, but watching him 'get into it' is painful...at least the looks on his face are painful.
When you see her in concert, you are never 10 inches away from her face.  The camera just keeps zooming and zooming,,, I want to watch it from the other side of my house.
Get the dvd.  It is more complete than the cd release.  There are some great new songs from wonderful new composers.",1017878400,4,614,4.545454545454546
8212912,3,B00005OBBH,I love Betty Buckley and love hearing her sing. Unfornately this DVD offering does little to showcase a truly remarkable talent.,1016064000,,128,5.142857142857143
