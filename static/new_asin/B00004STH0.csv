1348372,1,B00004STH0,"Well I would like to tell the producer of this film to do more research  when he or someone like him would do this type of movie.  Also, I would  have liked to see all aspectes of the cause of the invasion of that Island.  We were only shown from only one view point.  That's not right, also why  would a film producer show the nationists as crazed poeple?.  They were  trying to unit Cyprus with Greece not try to take the Island over.  Unless  the producer was only giving us his impression of what happened on that  Island, if'sthat's the case then he was just to make a quike buck that's  all.  He had no intention of presenting the facts, just his idea of what  took place.  I don't know if this person is from Cyprus, but if he is, then  he has no clue of what heppened to all those poor poeple and what really  took place.  For excample, why was Cyprus invaded, why did the nationist  acted that way, why did Macario acted that way, what led up to the invation  of cyprus.  I don't want to go through all the specifics, because I don't  have the space, but I will say this.  The producer did follow the five  basic's of reporting a story, and they are when, where, who, what and why.  My last thoughts on this matter is as follows.  The producer of this film a  lot to learn when he makes a film about real life events, and please do us  Greeks and the world a faver, either learn from your mistakes or go do  other types of films like fiction.",968025600,11,1451,4.137184115523466
1348373,1,B00004STH0,"As a Greek-Cyrpiot who lost his home to the Turks in 1974, I was hoping that this film would show the atrocities and crimes conducted by the Turkish army when they invated Cyprus. After all it is a film by a  ""well-known"" (so he claims) Greek Cypriot director.  Boy, was I  fooled.  This is a disgusting, shameless propaganda in favour of the  communists and Makarios (who was probably the one to blame for most of  Cyprus' problems in the 60s and 70s).
This communist propaganda tool  doesn't even bother with the facts or the actual invasion.  The Turkish  onslaught on Cyprus, the crimes of the Turkish army against the Greeks and  the loss of life and property  get only a few minutes on film. The rest of  the film is a gloryfication of Makarios and his megalomania and  selfimportance that destroyed the island.  The filmmaker's shameless  obsession to disparage all Nationalists and their fight for Union with  Greece, is frigthening to almost a criminnal point. It is scary to think  that another Greek actually promotes these opinions. Any Greek should be  angry and feel insulted and infuriated by people like Cacoyiannis and this  film.  No wonder the Turks  are winning the international war of words on  Cyprus, and the Aegean sea.  We can thank the likes of the director for  that.
The nationalists who fought the British for the union with Greece  are portrayed as deranged criminals who destroyed Cyprus.  No mention is  given to the fact that the communists colaborated with the Turks and the  Brits against the Greeks Nationalists in the 50s, causing the death of  hundreds of Greek freedom fighters.  Grivas, the man who succesfully fought  the Brits, is portrayed as an imperialist who was losing his mind in the  fight for the Union with Greece.
Throughout the ""interviews"",  light and camera angles are used to convey the directors feelings towards  Makarios and the communists (he worships them), and against the  nationalists.  At some points the film feels as staged and acted as an  Oliver Stone conspiracy-theory production. The director uses standard  Hollywood overdubs and well staged  shots to ensure that the viewer is  convinced that all nationalists were out to kill the innocent masses.  Just watch the crowd delirium scene at the rally where one person is shot  and the following well staged interviews with the victim's family.
If  you want to find out about the beautiful island of Cyprus and its thousand  years old Greek history, as well as  the 1974 invasion by Turkey and the  crimes that followed, THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT MEDIUM.  This is simply a one  sided point of view by a person who just happened to have the access to the  film equipment at the right time. I am not even sure if this film was  sponsered by any Greek resources since it almost justifies the Turkish  invasion.
SHAME SHAME SHAME.",963187200,41,2842,4.8045738045738045
1348443,3,B00004STH0,"Interesting how so many of the comments are not about the film itself, but about the self righteousness of perceived truth.

One thing for sure, this war, what led up to it, the consequences that it had for the people of Cyprus, is truly a forgotten place in world history, very few people know that it happened and what really ocurred.

For that, this film has value, and whether it pretends or not to be a sole source is perhaps not important--any film will represent a point of view.

Was it a good film as a film?  I found it interesting because the topic is interesting, and there should be much more visibility of what happened, to both sides, during and after the 1974 war.

My perspective on war is this:

I was in a restaurant during the Falkans War, they announced that the British had just sunk the Argentinian Cruiser, and 800 Argentinians had died. The room erupted with cheering.

My companion, who was from Cyprus, said:  ""But think of all the mothers""

The room went quiet.

This film does the same for me, for the people who suffered on both sides.",1126396800,11,1065,4.471502590673575
1348444,5,B00004STH0,"This is a fantastic documentary, by an established and well-known director.

If Cacoyannis could go back to Cyprus right now to document what is happening some of the images might be even more disturbing. From the churches that the Turks have turned into farms for their pigs to the abandonded houses and streets of Famagusta and Morphou that once were full of joy. Most of the part of the island that the Turks illegaly occupy looks more like a Third World country.

The Turkish-Cypriots will confess that they never asked to be ""rescued"" by the Turks in 1974.

A new documentary on ""The Rape of Cyprus - 31 years after"" is desperately needed to reveal to the world how Turks thing and operate and how they refuse to cooperate with international, UN, and EU laws.",1117756800,11,764,4.644444444444445
1348445,1,B00004STH0,It seems funny to me that The events of 1974 seem to be the only talking point from a greek Cypriot perspective. And it seems a mystery to me why the events of the 10 years before the Turkish intervention never seem to be documented. Killings murders and attampted genocide of the Turkish Cypriot population by the Greek Cypriots seems so un-important. Not forgetting the many Greek Cypriots killed by other Greek Cypriots from opposing factions. What is the point of this film ? it is a sob story made by a one eyed director. Unfortunately this sort of propaganda is all too readily availobale from all greek Cypriot sources. I ask all believers in the validity of this documentary : describe the events between 1960 to 1974. Then we might consider changing the name of this film to somthing like'Rescue from Genocide !!!',1091318400,14,823,4.722222222222222
1348446,4,B00004STH0,"I have to admit that the producer did a wonderful job in describing the 1974 events in Cyprus. He provided the details of the coup organized by Greece and its aftermath along with Turkey's intervention. This shows that he is not trying to blame Turkey for everything happenned in Cyprus. His work involves interviews with real people who went through real events. I was moved by his interview with Greek Cypriots who lost their relatives or houses right after the Turkish intervention. This movie helped me a lot to understand the sufferrings of Greek Cypriots and every Turkish Cypriot should watch it in order to understand that we are not the only ones who sufferred in Cyprus. The only critism I have is that the producer never mentioned the period between 1963-1974 and Turkish Cypriot sufferrings and acted as if Turkey intervened Cyprus just because of Greek organized coup, which is not true. He should have explained the events (mainly EOKA attacks against Turkish Cypriots) that led to Turkish intervention. A Turkish Cypriot movie showing the sufferrings of Turkish Cypriots during 1963-1974 will be a perfect complement to this movie.
It is a very powerful documentary because it is so real and everyone with slight interest in Cyprus history should watch it.",1072224000,31,1271,5.0
1348447,5,B00004STH0,"Michael Cacoyannis turned his cameras away from ancient Greek tragedy and Zorba to events happening on his own island, Cyprus. He worked with a small camera and no actors. The chorus, as we have known in Electra, Iphigenia or the Trojan Women, are the tragic figures of the tragedy of Cyprus, of Cacoyannis own people. These people were betrayed by the Greek military junta of Athens and then invaded and raped by what was considered the best army in Europe, the Turkish army. These were, in the words of the British Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, refugees in their own land.
Michael Cacoyannis is not afraid to castigate the major powers and the Greeks for the disaster they brought down on this small Mediterranean island, which still today remains divided with the problem unsolved.
Attila 74 is reality. That is why in reviews in these pages, Greeks and Turks wrote against it. I am a Cypriot and I say bravo to the honesty of Michael Cacoyannis.",1070841600,12,955,4.793939393939394
1348448,5,B00004STH0,"so this dvd, is what i grew up with. because i am a christian orthodox cypriot. 25 years old, i know that what you will see on this video is not quite unbiased. there is nothing as such when refferring to modern history. the facts though remain the same. as soon as cyprus was free and independant to choose her fate after the heroic struggle of the right wing nationalists for freedom, and the hiding and traditory acts of the left, it was then that the greek junta was instructed to leave cyprus in the hands of makarios, the looser leader, the people's only choice since he didn't leave anyone oppose him, and eventually the distruction of the island. then the turks that claimed to be suffering in cyprus by the greek cypriots were used for propaganda from turkey, to invade the island. turkey had maps of cyprus, divided as it is today, on the walls of elementary schools in turkey, since the 1950s. so coup or not, turkey had its plans. and the video shows a bit of the pain of the normal people, that lost perents, brothers and sisters.

I couldn't watch it after seeing her react like that, then I showed it to my father and he said ""I can't watch that""  I feel so horrible for having purchased this and bringing it into my parents house.  I watched the DVD finally by myself and the parts that showed the aftermath of Turkey's invasion was extremely difficult to watch.

1348450,5,B00004STH0,"This documentary shows the suffering of the Greek people, caused by turkish barbarism, while their memories were still fresh. In no way was the invasion a response to the rebellion against the corrupt Makarios, since Turkey had planned this invasion ever since the birth of the Cypriot state, after the 1955-1959 freedom struggle of EOKA. Of course the liars and communists of AKEL like to think that they know everything, but if it weren't for the heroes of EOKA B and the units of the Greek army stationed in Cyprus, while AKEL members ran to the mountains for safety, all of Cyprus would have fallen to the invader.",1039651200,7,618,4.731481481481482
1348451,5,B00004STH0,"Lets get this straight my grandmother was one of the last to be murdered by Turkish forces so I can compare the movie to facts. The Greeks of Greece did nothing to stop the coup because of their generals instigating the coup, the so called nationalists Eoka B carried it out, Cyprus was an independant state why should of it been united with another country Greece which had rejected it on numerous occassions in the past Makarios led an independant state trying to keep it non alligned there is nothing wrong with that. Had we of united with Greece then the Turkish minority would of had the right to expect the same. Cyprus was free for the first time in 9000,
years all 3 guarrentor countries failed miserably the Greeks, Turks,British and right wing nationalist factions on both sides betrayed the people of Cyprus. This film tells it how it was lets leave it in the past and move onto peace both sides are guilty in the past let both sides be brave and move on. Like it or not Makarios was a great leader and strong which is why some wanted rid of him. And believe it or not not only was my grandmother killed, but my stepmother is Makarios cousin and he most definatly was not communist he just moved on and tried to do the best for his country and people who he loved and who loved him back. This film depicts that the truth but shows what a disaster can be cuased by nationalism and facism. The Turks can never justify the invasion or the brutal murder of men women and children or the raping and pillaging going on this is the only fault of the film not showing the world more of what Turkish troops did. It most definatly is not a propaganda movie.",1037145600,10,1658,4.368932038834951

Many questions: Why UK didn't act as she must have, why massacres done by EOKA to Turks before the invasion is not mentioned? why many common graves are not mentioned?, why Greece didn't stop the Coup D'etateers?

7921928,1,B00004STH0,"Cacoyannis is a great director and this documentary is very well presented except for the fact that is a one-sided view of the events. I admire his courage in filming the events of the summer of 1974 and what followed almost as they were happening. It brought back sad memories of those days as I have lived them as a child. Unfortunately it is a one-sided propaganda that Greek Cypriots so much love to repeat even to this day, actually even more so today.

I love the way he presents the human suffering of the refugees, it is real and shows the human suffering of war and its consequences. It is sad to see though that he completely ignores the suffering of the Turkish Cypriot refugees. Nor is he mentioning the terror they must have gone thru following the coup knowing its leader was planning to ""eliminate"" them. Nor does he mention the fact the T/Cs were forced to live in enclaves since 1964 by the Makarios' regime and by their own nationalists. To his defense it would've been impossible at the time to interview T/C's because of the military situation on the island. But considering he fails to mention the events that lead to the situation in an objective way I doubt he would've had any interest.

He does a great job in blaming the US and British involvement in the events of '74. He also does a great job in blaming EOKA B and the Greek supported coup of July 15th that lead to the Turkish invasion a few days later. If one objectively analyzes the actions of Turkey and all agreements that were in place then invasion might not be the appropriate term. But whatever term we use the fact is the Cypriot constitution allowed the three guarantor powers (namely Turkey, Greece and the UK) to militarily intervene in case of a crisis. So Turkey had every legal right to invade since Greece was obviously behind the coup. Also knowing the person in charge of the coup, Nikos Sampson, had a lifelong dream for a ""final solution"" of Turkish Cypriots(as he readily admitted in interviews in later years) perhaps one might say Turkey even had a moral obligation to intervene. In any case when the Greeks invaded using their minions in Cyprus what they had in mind was not enosis as the fool Sampson thought, but a double-enosis, well, half of their plan at least worked...

However, to present Turkey as the innocent party here will be a stretch of reality as Turkey's plans of capturing part of Cyprus have been on the drawing board since the 50's (and of course so were Greece's plans). Also, after the invasion and since the early 2000's Turkey showed no real interest in solving the problem and withdrawing its troops. This shows that the welfare of the T/Cs was not the only thing on Turkey's mind.

I find Makarios's comments about the percentages of victims with the US population as moronic. This kind of cheap reasoning will go down well with most G/CS though as they've been so well conditioned by Makarios' ideology to find all kinds of excuses to prove that Turks are ""barbarians"" and that the G/Cs are innocent virgins and always the victims. This nationalist Makarios is presented here as a moderate and ""peace-loving"" yet his own list of atrocities towards the T/cs are never mentioned('63-'64, '67). Makarios has no problem lying on camera eiher, for example his statement about the ""3000 missing people""... It turns out that, he, Makarios, made the political decision to lie about the number of missing people and blame it on the Turks. This number was later reduced to figure of around 1600 missing people and remained so till the 90's until finally a committee to investigate reduced the number to a few hundreds, which a number of them are victims of internal fighting between EOKA B thugs and Makarios paramilitary gangs.

Cacoyannis does a great job in presenting EOKA B' ultra-nationalistic views and actions. What he fails to mention though is that EOKA B is a mere splinter group of Makarios' nationalistic ideology that was dominating G/C politics since the 50's. The difference between Makarios's ideology and EOKA B is one of degree. Their immediate goals might have differed but the ideology was one and the same, one of nationalism and division. Let's not forget EOKA B's leader Grivas was Makarios' hand-picked military leader for years.

Cacoyannis fails miserably to apportion the blame on the mainstream nationalistic views that were dominating the island under Makarios regime; sadly these views are alive and well till today. Makarios has a direct responsibility in cultivating this nationalistic ideology amongst G/Cs which Rauf Denktash among the T/Cs was following step by step.

Cacoyannis allows Makarios to explain how the 1960 constitution was so unfair and the T/Cs was so uncooperative yet he makes no effort in blaming Makarios for failing to even try to make it work. Instead Makarios organized the Akritas Plan whose purpose was to abolish the constitution and violenty oppress the T/Cs if they tried to resist, which they did in 1963 leading to the first partition of Cyprus. This was the beginning of the Rape of Cyprus, the division of Cypriots along racial lines perpetrated by both Makarios and Denktash in the early 60's.

The true ""Rape Of Cyprus"" is the nationalistic ideologies that were cultivated and supported by Makarios on one hand and Denktash on the other side. Their complete lack of goodwill and their insistence on diametrically opposing views  that would sooner or later lead to a permanent division of Cyprus along racial lines. This was achieved first in 1964 and finally in 1974 and remains to this day and unfortunately is the de facto solution.

 Makarios's nationalistic views not only have survived to this day but have almost completely eliminated any other form of objective reasoning among G/Cs. At the same time this lack of objective analysis serves the nationalist elite on both sides of the divide so well. The political elites use the paranoia created around the Cyprus problem as an excuse to remain in power by rejecting any form of reconciliation, in other words, they learned their lesson well from the calculating and autocratic Makarios - nationalism is good business!
  The list of G/C politicians flourishing by following this ideology is endless, most of Makarios' henchmen achieved political and economic power in a divided-yet-free-from-turks Cyprus,  rejectionist Kyprianou, Omirou, Lyssarides, arch-racist Papadopoulos are but a few of these pseudo-patriots.

 This documentary plays a role in perpetuating the myths and half-truths G/Cs are so well-conditioned in believing, thus plays no role in an objective analysis of what the real Rape of Cyprus was - the total lack of goodwill and reasoning.

7921933,2,B00004STH0,"I am a displaced ""greek"" Cypriot from the North part of Cyprus.
  This documentary fails to examine what led to Turkey's invation nor any of the atrocities we commited against the weaker turkish minority which we oppressed for years. A turkish-Cypriot could find no job, not even as a waiter, and we forced them to live in ghettos, in terrible poverty.
  IT WAS GREECE WHICH RAPED CYPRUS FIRST! In 1974 I was fourteen and I recall the first civilian casualties being from Greek tanks. Turkish tanks landed on the island five days later. This is never mentioned in our History textbooks. Most of us have been brainwashed through an intensely hellinocentric education where Greeks are always the good guys and the innocent victims, and through Greek Orthodox Religious Studies (an obligatory school subject since age five). Our schools breed racist Orthodox talibans who are totally intolerant of other religions, including other Christian denominations, and especially hostile towards Moslems. And when these talibans commit racist crimes (as in the 2005 murder of a turkish-Cypriot boy in Limassol) the press describe them simply as remote cases of mental illness instead of as mass products of our education system.
  The church here is so influential that I consider my country as the "" Iran of the Christian World "". There even exist Iran-type church courts which nowadays (fortunately) deal mainly with Family Law cases.
  The Republic of Cyprus is the only European Union country where authorities violate human rights (US State Department Report on Human Rights, 2006) and the police torture citizens (Amnesty International Press Release on the torture of two handcuffed students by 12 policemen, April 2006). Trafficking of women for prostitution is semi-legal, big scandals are never resolved, night bombers, murderers and drug barons are seldom brought to justice, etc., etc. All this in half an island of 600.000 people with one of the highest percentages of policemen in Europe! And the law very rarely applies to the rich and pious for reasons of ""public interest"".
  I don't think the situation in the Northern part is that bad. There is a lower crime rate, it is a secular state where moslem clergy have no political power and it does not foster the illusion of being a ""European"" country. People there are more genuine and less spoilt.
  Although the so-called ""official"" Republic of Cyprus is an independent member of the UN and the European Union it is in fact A PUPPET STATE OF GREECE:
  1. We have been programmed to consider ourselves Greeks and not Cypriots. If Greece wins in an international contest in which Cyprus has lost, we celebrate as if our own country has won. We are ashamed to consider ourselves simply citizens of our country without any prefixes. If a native dares call himself a Cypriot and not a Greek, he is accused of being a traitor. (Same as if Norwegians were forced to consider themselves Swedes just because they speak a similar language and have the same religion!)
  2. Cyprus is the only country in the world without its own National Anthem (we use Greece's).
  3. Our national flag is semi-official (it is subordinate to the Greek flag which is conspicuous on all government buildings, schools, churches, clubs, in the army, even in athletic facilities). During soccer games Cypriot flags are considered ""provocative"" symbols and are confiscated by the security but Greek flags are permited.
  4. Major political decisions taken by our governement must first obtain the OK of the Greek prime minister.
  5. Our army is run by officers from Greece.
  In April 2004 the United Nations, with the support of the United States, carried out a referendum for peace and reunification. The vast majority of greek-Cypriots voted No, employing all sorts of excuses (the president even wept on TV in his attempt to convince people vote No), while turkish-Cypriots voted Yes. The government, backed by the large communist-turned-nationalist party, considers this ""No"" as a victory against the almighty United States !!!
  It seems that most of us believe the ideal solution to be the construction of a Time-Machine that would transport us back to before 1974 and reestablish greek dynasty in the island.
  Deprogramming greek-Cypriots will not be an easy task and cinema can make a significant contribution. This film however is biased and superficial. It fails to clearly show younger generations what really happened before and during 1974 so as to prevent the recurrence of similar events in the future.",1133740800,31,4542,5.060402684563758
