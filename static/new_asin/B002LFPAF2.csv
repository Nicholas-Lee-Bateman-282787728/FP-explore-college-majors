If you're into naked girls running around tropical Islands, there's plenty of that. It's also filmed quite well, the cinematography is very nice, but you can barely see it. If a better copy of this movie came out I'd buy it again, because I really like it.
So, do I get my money back or what?",1275177600,7,414,4.253164556962025
8372630,2,B002LFPAF2,"The real title of this Italian soft-core dud is 'FREE LOVE', and it`s from 1973 not`74. It features Laura Gemser prior to taking over the reigns in the notorious 'EMANUELLE' series,(one 'M' was dropped to avoid copyright infringement) and she looks marvelous, IF we could only see her properly - the film print utilized is a bad copy of a bad copy of a 30 year-old VHS tape - yes, it`s that bad, at least on a big screen. The picture 'rolls' from bad tracking for the first 5 minutes, the colors are muddy, washed out, there`s absolutely no contrast in the darker scenes, and outdoor scenes look like the film was over-exposed. It was filmed in the Seychelles Islands, so it would be pleasant enough as a travelogue if the picture wasn`t atrocious, AND there`s another stunning Euro-beauty who doesn`t even get a cover credit who is incredible to peer at, as she`s almost always naked, as is Laura Gemser. We need to start sending death-threats to MYA communications for re-releasing bad movies without ANY attempt at finding a decent print source or remastering, then re-titling them to lure us in so we don`t even know what film we are actually purchasing. AND the film is 1:33 and not 1:77 as listed. I`m getting weary of bashing MYA, but someone has to pick up the sword till this battle`s won... zero stars for the film print, two for Laura and the Euro-beauty we can`t leer at properly...",1269388800,7,1394,4.625
