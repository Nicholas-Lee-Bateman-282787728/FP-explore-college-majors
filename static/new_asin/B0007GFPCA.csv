8047180,1,B0007GFPCA,"This DVD was released in 2003 by Discovery Channel. It`s only 50 minutes long and contains old video footage. They released a newer DVD in 2008 with the title called ""Shark Week: Ocean of Fear"" . That set of DVD is much better. It`s also more than 300 minutes long.",1330992000,,265,4.32
8047181,3,B0007GFPCA,"If you are fasinated by the Great White Shark, you are going to like this documentray film. As the Discovery Channel as done in the past the quality of this one is the same... very good. This film highlights what the Great Whites that are associated with the pacific region do as far as traveling, what they prey on and what impacts the sharks within this area have on the areas around them. I would recommend this film to anyone that is geniunely fascinated with the Great White shark.",1190678400,4,486,4.47191011235955
