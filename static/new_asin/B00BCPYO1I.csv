8566395,5,B00BCPYO1I,"very fun local memphis film. Creative concept, I enjoyed what they did with this very much. Great film! I am so proud of our Memphis artists and actors.",1379116800,,152,4.464285714285714
8566396,5,B00BCPYO1I,"From acting to plot line - really enjoyed this and it focused more on the hunters than trying to go over-kill with vamps and lots of splatter. Final ending was done very well, from music on down and was a suprise. Quality was good too -- suggest grabbing a copy while still in circulation as will I think, be a cult classic type in future.  Also the 2nd special features disc with the news-reels and the web-chat sessions to e-mail questions was great to have.",1377043200,,460,4.411764705882353
8566397,4,B00BCPYO1I,"I enjoyed this film for the most part. The ""behind the scenes"" view of vampire hunting was pretty neat, and there were some great original takes on vampire (and vampire hunting mythology). The performances were not too bad, though there were a lot of terrible line deliveries. Honestly, I feel the actors might have been let down by the script when it came to the dialogue (and even some of the monologues felt off). It was overly verbose, and there were times where the characters had some unnecessarily drastic tonal shifts (though I am unsure if that was on account of the script or the actors). Overall though, I enjoyed it. Especially the ending. That was a very well-done scene from both the performance and the technical aspects. I would like to see what the team could do with a higher budget and a tighter script. For an amateur film, this is fairly enjoyable.

PROS:
Original ideas
The finale
*SPOILER There will be a second one!

CONS:
Some weak line delivery
Overly verbose dialogue
No, really...there's a lot of the previous two.",1374537600,,1042,4.71978021978022
8566398,5,B00BCPYO1I,"Saw this film at a film fest in Chicago. Great flick, very original take on vampires. Wanted to watch it again and found it on here, but yes the audio doesn't work. I contacted Amazon support as well and they told me they would look into it.

Found that it is available to watch online on other sites though: [...] and from the film's website at [...] There's Blu-ray versions and DVDs for sale on here and at the film's site as well. Again, great film, just don't want to see it get a bad rap because Amazon screwed up the audio.",1366416000,,530,4.196078431372549
8566399,1,B00BCPYO1I,"I rented this video product on 24 March 2013.  I downloaded it to my PC and it had no audio.  I spent almost three hours on the telephone with digital customer support, re-downloaded the film several times and it still had no audio.  I was given the purchase version to download to see if that helped.  No audio as well.

I was informed by the digital customer support representatives that they could not view the product to determine if it had audio or not, that had to be done by their development team.  I may be missing something here, but it would seem to me that this would be a natural obligation of the customer support folks.  They simply do not have a means of doing this!

I was informed that their development people would eventually look at it, and I would be notified when it was corrected.  In the meantime, it is still on the website for rental and purchase download!  There is apparently no quality control at Amazon for their digital products.  This is ridiculous!

I have rented/purchased and downloaded other products which are just fine when played on my desktop.  The problem lies with the digital product in this and three other cases which I will be documenting.  Hopefully, this will provide the apparently necessary catharsis to Amazon to fix its digital download problems!

The film looked interesting and I would really like to watch it.  Maybe Amazon will eventually fix it and I will be able to do so.",1364515200,,1431,4.596837944664031
