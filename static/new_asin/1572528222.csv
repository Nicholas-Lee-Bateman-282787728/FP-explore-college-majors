7849948,5,1572528222,"This is an excellent portryal of a love triangle, starting as much of a surprise to all concerned.  It is at once sad, outrageous, and somewhat amusing.  The acting is outstanding if understated at times.",1384905600,,204,4.8
7849949,5,1572528222,"Marie meets Benoit through a personal ad.  Touched by his shyness and the photo of his best friend Pierre that he sends with his response - Marie meets, courts and marries Benoit.  During the wedding Pierre realizes that he too is in love with Marie.  What follows is a tragic, sometime outlandish tale of two people trying to behave properly as they wreck the happiness of the other person most dear to them.

CAC's Comments:  This tale is extremely comical while captivating its audience.",1246924800,,490,4.785714285714286
7849950,2,1572528222,"A French adaptation of a Julian Barnes novel, this is a pretty basic and very tedious romantic triangle: when shy loser Yvan Attal hooks up with Charlotte Gainsbourg, his luck changes while his best friend Charles Berling's fortunes suffer reverses as he falls for her and bores passing strangers by telling them his hopes of how to win her. Unfortunately this seems to be by going for the Anakin Skywalker route of whining her into submission, as his tiresome self-pity gradually and inexplicably wins her over.

There are a few nice moments: a wedding photo in which all three reveal their innermost thoughts, one of Berling's captive confessors asking him ""Don't you ever get tired of your bulls**t?"" and Berling following his comparison of an affair being as unsatisfactory as a holiday in Marbella by his nervous rambling that ""Actually, Marbella can be nice at this time of year. I went there once. It's best to go off season."" Similarly, his dismissal of Leonard Cohen's genius by admitting he finds a lack of imagination in rhyming 'ay' with 'ay ay ay' neatly punctures Attal's tendency to play Cohen's waltz at every opportunity. Unfortunately they are few and far between, and Berling is astonishingly annoying here. You keep on waiting for someone to hit him, repeatedly (now there's an idea for a movie!), but it never happens. There is one great final confrontation when Attal confronts the two: his performance has real power here and the writing mirrors the ebb and flow and awkwardness of such moments. But it's not enough.",1120262400,7,1539,4.9192307692307695
7849951,5,1572528222,"If you are deceived at the very 1st step, how would you feel? If the picture that comes as a reply for your ad belongs not to the sender but to a close friend of his, does it mean that you are deceived? How would you  react when ""that"" close friend of your husband says he is in love  with you? Are in you love with your husband or the man in ""that""  picture? If you do feel deceived at the 1st step, would you admit it &  enjoy adultery?
Marie, Benoit & Pierre form this infernal triangle  with touching humour. Freely based on Barnes' novel ""Talking it  Over"", Vernoux depicts an unforgettable romantic comedy, sometimes  reaching the shores of a heart-wrenching drama. The artistry of Vernoux,  however, is the way of juxtaposing these three different persons (and their  different paths in reaching love) where the major virtues (or flaws) of  being human become the intersection points. Surprisingly enough, the viewer  feels close to the all three characters, appreciates & understands  their motives, though the happiness of one means misery to the other. It is  very striking to see how one can hurt the very dear ones with the pursuit  of love & the bliss it brings. Vernoux, just like Barnes, frames this  complexity in the lives of these three comical characters and, without  being formal, harsh & biased, underpins the emotional havoc love can  escort.
In fact, both the novel & the film mostly deal with the  ""etc."" part, not the ""love"" part. After all, all  emotions can blacken and/or become bitter with the ""spicy""  accumulation of these small ""etc.""s. This is actually what Marie,  Benoit & Pierre experience. They hide, they deceive and they wish to  find the love they deserve. Do they find it in the end? Well, they surely  do, but it is shockingly (maybe preferably) different than the novel's  original ending..
When it's about love, everything ""seems""  insignificant. Maybe that's when betrayal feels right..
Join in, and  ""Take This Waltz"". It surely will linger in your mind for a long,  long time..",958176000,8,2025,4.760806916426513
