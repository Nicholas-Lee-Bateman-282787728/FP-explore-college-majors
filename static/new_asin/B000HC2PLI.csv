2633845,3,B000HC2PLI,"Have you ever gone to bed right after a meal of hot, spicy food?  Did you keep waking up and going back to sleep again?  That gives you an idea what this movie is like.  It feels like one of those surreal ""waking dreams"".  I don't know any other way to describe it.  If you've seen David Lynch's Eraserhead or Luis Bunuel's An Andalousian Dog, then you might have an idea what I mean.  Don't expect it to make any sense, at least not in an orderly, linear way.  You have to be in the right mood for this one.",1202515200,2,508,4.02
2633846,5,B000HC2PLI,"Use CAUTION when watching this movie! Dont watch it if you have epilepsy, and in all cases i would suggest using the buddy system for every viewing. Also...i personally feel that it is irresponsible to watch ""Visions of Suffering"" more than once a week. Your brain may need to recover.

I bought this movie at a horror convention, based only on the cover art and the sellers statement that it was ""really weird"". Well...he didn't lie. I have NEVER seen ANYTHING like this movie. The best way i can think to describe it is...okay remember the cursed videotape in ""The Ring""? That little minute-and-a-half long sequence of just one stressful, frightening image after another? Think something like that....for two hours.

 The story is about a guy having an unimaginably bad drug trip and director Andrey Iskanov (who also plays ""the priest"" in the film) conveys this concept extremely well through the use of wiggling textures, bizarre camera angles, and sounds. If you WERE to watch ""Visions of Suffering"" in an altered state of mind, theres probably a very serious chance that you could ruin your life forever. EVERYTHING in this movie is frightening, and not often through the use of gore. There is a cocker-spaniel puppy that is absolutely terrifying. And the fish sandwich....oh man. The ""shape"" of the letterboxing is also changing constantly. Im not even actually sure that the movie is presented in widescreen, but instead some kind of blurry, ever changing black borders that seem to constrict the size of the picture on your tv screen, creating a consistantly claustrophobic sensation.

I love this movie and I show it to everyone. I actually own two copies so I can lend one out to people. It changed the way I think about film making. If you are confident in your ability to maintain a grip on reality in the face of pure, unadulterated terror...then give yourself some dvd-induced Visions of Suffering as soon as possible.",1197072000,23,1933,4.902140672782875
2633847,5,B000HC2PLI,"First off I have to say Andrey Iskanov is truly an artist. The opening scene  (just to give a little away) starts with a priest who loses his faith smack in the middle of an intense nightmare thats depicted very well.
The movie is completely in Russian but thats ok because there really isn't that much dialogue and it relies on the mood and visual effects that are pulled off quite impressively. The way vampires/demons are depicted in this film are not in the conventional sense that has been used and reused over and over again. This is basically a very strange and bizarre horror movie that I would highly recommend for anyone looking for something thats like a breath of fresh air from the same repetitious ideas we are all used to seeing.",1194825600,18,744,4.552238805970149
2633848,5,B000HC2PLI,"Very interesting movie.  Only problems was I could not find the English subtitles.  I tried and tried in the extras section and could not find it, even though it says that it is there on the box.  Good part for me is I'm studying Russian.  If I  have the subtitles, I probably will probably not try to translate.  For me it is a great movie and a way to practice my Russian language.  Vampires in this movie is a little different than the common one most horror fans know of.  These are more like creatures that attack you when you sleep through your dreams.  Hard to explain if the movie was in English.  Main character is charismatic which helps the crazy jumping around in the movie.",1185926400,4,686,4.373015873015873
2633850,5,B000HC2PLI,"WOW! Andrey Iskanov is an incredible once in a lifetime talent. Creepy visuals that stay with you even long after the movie is over.  For fans of The Wall, Clockwork Orange, Nosferatu (1979 Werner Herzog)....disregard the one star reviews and definitely check out this film.  If you want high budget Hollywood - this is not for you - if you enjoy being challenged visually - this IS for you.  This would be best described as an art film with an avant story line.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1257724800,4,481,4.623529411764705
2633851,1,B000HC2PLI,"Don't be fooled: there is nothing ""Lynchesque"" about Visions of Suffering, nor is it anywhere near Jacob's Ladder, nor is it surreal or ""dangerous"" or even the least scary. It's just plain, ugly and pretentious amateur. I'll try to enlist some of the things you may want to know about this film before purchasing:

1. To begin with, there is no plot, no storytelling, no consistency of any kind. Now, permit me to insist: this is not nonlinear, surreal or conceptual narrative. It's just the kind of ""horror story"" a kid would compose for an assignment, given an ""unorthodox"" approach that results in complete failure.
2.- The cinematography is hideous (from the very moment you see a 3D grinning skull in the opening credits, you know there's something wrong with this film). Expect 120 minutes of 3D graphics that are not even rendered, with not a single coherent idea of color, camera work, editing or special effects. This film was post-produced 30 minutes before the DVD was released.
3.- The acting is lame, unconvincing, unrehearsed and far from being professional.
4.- The music score must be one of the worst I ever heard. It's but a continuous sampling of industrial/electronic clichs, something a Coil fan boy would come up with.
5.- The film has an overall lack of understanding of what is being done. I wager there is not a single person in the Visions of Suffering team that has had even mild success in the film industry. This is a pretentious movie made by pretentious amateurs for a pretentiously dumb audience. Anyone with a minimum of taste is likely to be offended by this russian baloney, finding it hard to understand how anyone could insult the watcher's intelligence so.

Let me conclude by saying Visions of Suffering is little more than a homemade film, which wouldn't be strictly wrong if it wasn't also incredibly pretentious, boring, claustrophobic, lame, clichd, ridiculous and absolutely devoid of talent. If it was possible, I would give Visions of Suffering minus far stars, for it is not worth even the plastic it's encased in.

I'm sorry Andrey Iskanov, but this is, by far, one of the worst excuses for a film I've ever watched.

Hope this review can be useful for prospective buyers.",1254441600,10,2220,4.849604221635884
2633852,5,B000HC2PLI,"These are the words I would use to describe this movie. Like another review said there are no words to really explain the movie but you will find many things in this movie illogical and just plain weird. If you think you have seen it all I would definitely give this movie a try, and also I should also point out that the movie isn't perfect but knowing that this movie was made independently and under a really tight budget I would give it an A+.",1227571200,5,447,4.209302325581396
2633853,1,B000HC2PLI,"A friend brought this over the other night to watch and I went to blockbuster and rented Shrek as an alternative to viewing this movie.  We saw this movie years ago...and we suffered.  It took us 4 sittings to make it to the end.  Now...years later when this movie is brought before me...I have to fight the urge to shed tears.  So yea we are emotionally scarred.  I was interested in seeing Nails but after finding out it was by the same guy I decided against it.

The movie is very drab.  The plot is confusing and honestly I don't even know if it has a plot.  It jumps from a man who is afraid of rain because it brings out demons, to him being concerned about his phone not working, to people in a night club shooting up.  The character's were not very developed so it just made us not really care too much about what happened to them.  The dialogue is very monotone.  The colors and settings were also very dull...so there wasn't anything visually appealing either.

I will say it is an excellent sleep aid if you are having trouble getting to sleep.",1222041600,,1055,4.326530612244898
2633854,2,B000HC2PLI,"Note: Russian with English subtitles (contrary to what the `Product Details' indicate).

Synopsis: A young man awakes from a nightmare on a dark, rainy night. He always has bad dreams when it rains. As he smokes a cigarette and meanders around his apartment the surreal atmosphere of his dream seems to invade slowly into his waking reality. A repair comes to fix his phone and as he works he begins to talk about vampires and spirits and how the become tangible when it rains. Not long after his departure he peers out of the window and notices mysterious man in black coat and hat standing motionless across the street. A little later he looks again and now there are three ""Men in Black"" all gazing towards his apartment window.

As all this is taking place the storyline flips back and forth to another young man dressed like a Catholic priest (whether he is one or not is uncertain) who is obsessed with an attractive Goth girl (who is connected to the young man having nightmares) who frequents a night club aptly named `Delirium', a hang out for Goths, sado-masochists and druggies.

As the strobe lights spur on the mindless hordes at the `Delirium' the rain continues to fall and the demonic beings outside the apartment move closer and closer to their prey. Will the rain ever stop? Is there no hope for escape?

Critique: The '05 Russian film `Visions of Suffering' is most definitely only for the most avant-garde amongst us. The images are intense, the violence disturbing and the demonic images repulsive. The music is a mixture of electronic and environmental sounds intermingled with demonic laughter, breathing and vomiting if you can imagine. This is one of those films that create an eerie, stifling atmosphere that seems to ooze out of the television into your room. Don't  watch it alone late at night and allow yourself the time to watch something immediately afterwards to get this one out of your mind as quickly as possible.",1212278400,7,1949,4.788690476190476
2633855,2,B000HC2PLI,"Being a fanatic of foreign horror, especially surreal cinema, I've been chomping at the bit to watch Visions of Suffering when I first saw the trailer on Unearthed's website.  I got my copy, dimmed the lights and pushed play, ready for a psychadelic rollercoaster of macabre imagery and surreal effects.

Problem is, there are NO subtitles.  And I don't speak Russian.  This problem is compounded with the trailer having English subtitles and the back of the DVD cover clearly stating ""Russian soundtrack with removable English subtitles"".

After inquiring with Unearthed about this, they got back to me immediately and said that some DVD players turn off the automatic subtitles for some reason and hitting the Subtitles button on your remote should do the trick.  Didn't work for me but Unearthed is still looking into other possible solutions, which is unbelievably incredible customer service, hats off to Unearthed.",1209168000,2,920,5.224489795918367
2633856,3,B000HC2PLI,"I have to admit, I'm not quite sure WHAT I saw. If it were not for the narrative at the beginning of the film stating that this guy's dreams are meshing with real life, I probably would have ejected the disc, and let the film languish on the shelf until I was bored enough to want to watch it again.
There IS still the constant of what I call East/West Translation. Seems it takes the Russians approximately 1 hour to tell a story that it would have taken Hollywood to tell in 20 minutes. Take the film ""Stalker"", for instance. This film is approximately 3 and a half hours long. The story could have been told in about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
""Visions of Suffering"" is no different. This could have been told in an hour. Don't believe me? Chris Carter did it for seven years with the X-Files! Yes, there were images that could not be filmed for TV, but considering the plodding stream of images that are supposed to be scary, the film falls short in the suspense department. The fish sandwich and the dog sequences are disturbing, but on the whole, I found this film lacking. Maybe if it WERE pared down to an hour, it might have been interesting.

I'll have to give it three stars for ATTEMPTING to be scary, but sadly, that is all.",1208044800,2,1233,4.337662337662338

If you like absolutely terrible trance music and scenes that drag on too for lack of good editing, maybe.  The cover for this looked awesome, but i couldn't wait until it was over.  It took me four or five times to get through it, no lie. The plot is stupid, the acting is terrible, and half the scenes are just strobe lights and sound effects in a club.

2633858,3,B000HC2PLI,"First off, let me begin by saying that I do not condone getting online and trashing a movie to it's core.  I know that there are as many different interests as there are people in the world.  Saying that, I will never say this movie is terrible, don't watch it, blah, blah, blah.  I will simply state what I saw while watching this...

I bought this shortly after reading some of the other reviews on this site.  All of the talk about this being ""just like the 1 1/2 min segment on the ring"" and ""not viewing this more than once a week"" got me completely interested.  Even the product description made me think this was going to be an absolute terrifying movie.

What props I will give the movie is that it is completely original.  The visiuals, storyline, and score are all different.  The camera work is amazing.  I see what people found frightening about the fish sandwich and maybe even the dog.

As for the rest of the film, I can't say much about it.  I was not in an altered state of mind, which might have helped.  I was completely sober with my eyes glued to the tube, and I still cannot say that I understood anything outside of the fact that Russians eat too many shrooms.  I didn't see anything outright scary about this movie, which is why I purchased this in the first place.  The stroyline jumped without reason, and the small amount of gore was so fake and drawn out that I actually felt uncomfortable after watching one death segment for around 5 min.

While I do appreciate the artistic value of this film I can't say that I would watch it again.  I'll piggyback on one of the other reviews; this movie is not for everyone.  If you like the artsy type of movies, then you might dig this.  If you're looking for a real horror movie, I suggest you look for the Evil Dead series.",1205625600,5,1794,4.333333333333333
2633859,2,B000HC2PLI,"Well this little art house flick left me wondering what i just seen and why i wasted 2hrs to see it. The film is shot so terribly that it gets to the point of annoyance. The plot to this movie i have no idea, the horror in the movie laughable i really don't understand the hype that this movie is getting on here.
 if you are a horror fan especially disturbing movies like cannibal holocaust or i spit on your grave things of that nature this movie will leave you bored and wondering where 2 hrs of your time just went. i know i keep saying 2hrs and that may be the biggest problem with this movie. the length and filming with strobe lights camera angles that make no sense black and white grain every 5mins a half lit screen most of the movie just gets annoying after about 20mins let alone 2hrs.
hate to say it but this is one of them film festivil arthouse flicks that got way over its head and way over rated on here.",1203465600,3,921,4.145251396648045

8138304,4,B000HC2PLI,"Visions of Suffering (Andrey Iskanov, 2006)

I love Andrey Iskanov. Honest to flaming perdition, I love Andrey Iskanov. Nails is one of the great avant-garde horror films of all time, and Philosophy of a Knife is the first really serious attempt at a goreumentary; it's what Men Behind the Sun should have been. The problem is that Nails was lean, fast, and punchy, in and out of your head in an hour and six minutes, and Philosophy of a Knife's major problem is that it's four and a half hours long, meandering, tangential, and frequently well off-track (which, ironically, only underlines the power of the times when it's on point). And then... you have the films in the middle that trace Iskanov's journey from point A to point B. Visions of Suffering was his follow-up to Nails. It is fully an hour longer than Nails, and while I am still going to give it a high rating, the simple fact of the matter is that it didn't need to be.

Normally this is the paragraph where I put a plot synopsis. Trying to do that with an Iskanov film makes about as much sense as trying to do it with a Dante Tomaselli film. (I love Tomaselli, too, and no one understands why.) I'm sure that somewhere in this movie there is something resembling a plot, but one look at the effects used on this film and you will probably come up with the same hypothesis I did; everyone involved was ingesting so much LSD while it was being filmed that they all kind of forgot the script even existed. I mean, seriously. Confession time: I have very little experience with LSD, and none of that experience involved hallucinations. On the other hand, I have a number of friends with considerably more experience, who have described to me, often as they were going on, those hallucinations in excruciating detail (hey, I never said these folks were poets). If I were to try and recreate what they told me about colors and waves and shapes and all that lot, the end result would come out looking extremely similar to Visions of Suffering. And, to be fair, there are hallucinogens ingested during the film (for real? I dunno), and so it's possible Iskanov was stone cold sober and going through the exact process I just described while trying to show the viewers the events from the perspective of a guy on acid. But I'm not sure I buy that.

Ultimately, Visions of Suffering is best looked at not as a horror film, perhaps not even as a gore film (though it is awash in the red stuff), but as an experimental art-piece; it seems to me that, stylistically, this is a movie that has more in common with Hollis Frampton than Herschell Gordon Lewis. (It is almost obligatory to raise the not-yet-dead corpses of Jan vankmajer and Elias Merhige here.) In hindsight, given Philosophy of a Knife and its obvious pretensions towards art-cinema, those comparisons make even more sense. I'm not going to say Iskanov succeeds entirelyVisions of Suffering is certainly no Begotten (it's not even Nails)but the movie is undeniably intriguing, a definite must-see for those who loved Nails and liked Philosophy of a Knife, even if it should have been thirty minutes shorter than it ended up being. *** ",1399161600,,3153,4.635062611806798
8138305,5,B000HC2PLI,"Seen this movie last night, I must say I really liked it. I myself am sick of watching mainstream horror movies that are vastly overrated. this movie was very different and had genuine atmosphere. The man in glasses segments were well done. That scene with the vampires in coats watching him made my hairs stand on end. The music is fantastic, some very creepy, others very heavy but fitting.

The only bad thing I can say is it gets a little confusing especially in the nightclub scenes but apart from that its quite easy to get the just of it and some of the CGI effects are a bit crazy. The make-up is brilliant and imagery plays with your eyes.

Overrall I would only recommend this to real fans of horror who want something different. Its a shame so many people watched this and felt the need to give it 1 when they obviously don't appreciate how much work they put it into it and the intensity they achieved.

Dont listen to the 1 star reviews. If you want a film that is very diverse and creepy with some really interesting effects then check this out. It is low budget but they did a great job, the camera work is very clever and the special effects are really intense. Low budget/underground horror is always much better than its big Hollywood mainstream counterpart.",1356220800,,1276,4.491379310344827

8138308,1,B000HC2PLI,"I purchased Visions of Suffering after reading raving reviews stating that this was a powerful, horrifying film that could be likened to a full-length film version of the tape in ""The Ring"". Unfortunately, what I found instead was one of the most snore-inducing, pretentious piles of heaping garbage that anyone has dared to call a film. Andrey Iskanov is hardly a visionary or even someone worthy of the title ""filmmaker"". Visions of Suffering is nothing more than two hours of crowded viewpoints of uninteresting characters who are given absolutely no backstories and are devoid of personality (this could be attributed equally to the poor direction and writing as it could be to simply poor acting ability throughout the ""cast"").

Never before have I checked the ""display"" function on my DVD player's remote to see how much time was left in the film so often. I kept holding onto the glimmer of hope given to me by positive reviews that this film would eventually turn around and provide even some juvenile form of entertainment, but it did no such thing. There is nothing even remotely effective about this film. Reviews I read prior to watching the film mentioned how horrifying certain aspects of the film were, but none of these (nor any other aspects of the film) are even relatively disturbing or potent. I simply do not understand how one could derive enjoyment out of this film. I would be truly disturbed if anyone were to see this film as insightful in any shape or form.

The film is so low-budget that, I kid you not, I have seen better quality (in terms of technology) home-made films for school projects done in the years I have attended college. The camera work is atrocious; hardly what anyone could dare to refer to as clever cinematography. The crowded viewpoints that permeate this film are simply uncomfortable, and not in even a minutely effective way either. They are just poorly implemented, just like every other aspect of Visions of Suffering. The sound is so poor and third-rate that I simply won't even discuss it beyond saying that the samples provided lack any bit of sophistication or merit.

I can only imagine that anyone who viewed this and enjoyed it is entirely unaccustomed to even moderately decent film making. This is the work of someone truly deluded and obsessed with their own work, and truly should not be viewed by anyone. Avoid this travesty of a film at all costs, or you will most surely regret the money spent and time wasted watching it.",1281312000,4,2489,4.7972027972027975

Although I liked the opening sequence featuring the character on the cover, the movie descended into total ridiculousness and empty shock value really quickly. About three quarters of the movie take place in a Russian goth club where some guy has apparently taken some bad acid. There are flashing strobe lights and dizzying camera movements that seem to go on and on forever, with the occasional scenes of necrophilia and a woman being repeatedly punched in the face thrown in for good measure.
