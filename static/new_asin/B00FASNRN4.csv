8613887,4,B00FASNRN4,"I love this movie along with most of the X-Men franchise but I'm here to review the 4K version which wasn't anything spectacular, yes there's some parts that look better than the 1080 Blu-Ray but not enough to buy the 4K version if you already  own the regular Blu-Ray version which I do , only bought the 4K version because it was very cheap,  Only buy the 4K version if you like X-Men First Class and don't own it .",1523145600,,417,4.2
