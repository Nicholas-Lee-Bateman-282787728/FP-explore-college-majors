5745635,5,B00CWZUOV6,I loved this movie.  It was very creative and action filled.  Kept my interest the whole time.  I saw the 3-D version.  Great movie for the whole family.  Will be a must for my DVD collection.,1348876800,7,192,4.222222222222222
5745636,5,B00CWZUOV6,"This movies was the best one we have seen as a family in a really long time.  We always end up seeing ""Family Movies"" that are not really age appropriate for an 11 year old.

This movie had so many different age groups in it and you could tell that everyone really enjoyed themselves.

This would be a perfect Family Movie Date Night, Romantic Date Night, Group of Friends, Little Kids and Friends, really any kind of groups could have fun with it.  My theory has always been if you don't have fun and everyone else around you is, well the movie was fun but maybe you weren't.

We will definitely be going back to see it again and can't wait for it to come out on DVD",1348790400,4,667,4.1796875
5745637,3,B00CWZUOV6,"This animated tale offers fun, but there's no big surprises going on, just a different take on an Adam Sandler flick. All the monsters including:Dracula; The Invisible Man; Frankenstein and his bride venture off on a mission to a hotel for the sole purpose of escaping a world filled with humans. However, a young man stumbles onto the resort with romantic sparks for Mavis, and trouble begins to brew. The story is about trusting a child to make their own discoveries. The themes are nightmare vacations, vampires, and werewolves. It's more entertaining than it is funny, and the characters do grab your attention!",1348790400,4,615,4.980582524271845

5745646,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Hotel Transylvania (2012) is good entertainment for the whole family, though geared more toward kids. The plot (though very simple) moves along, and doesnt slow down the film. This film is 100% CGI, but is of very high quality, and not a distraction with fake-looking characters  and choppy movements, like other animated films out there. I particularly like the fact that this film has just the right balance between comedy and horror; it doesnt overindulge in any one area, so you won't be overly frightened or laughing hysterically. The animation is very believable, and the characters are interesting. Overall, Hotel Transylvania is a solid first installment in the film series. The special features are very good as well.",1526083200,,726,5.1525423728813555

5745940,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Let's get it clear, I don't like Adam Sandler. I really don't, these past few years he's been kinda annoying, he seems to think he's revelant in today's culture but he's not.  However he does a pretty good job here and is pretty funny. He was good in the last one but I think he was excellent here. He should be doing more animated movies like this, unlike some others. I think he could really make a career out of this.  When I watched this movie I didn't hear Adam Sandler, I heard his character and that is impressive
Now let's get to the movie,  it's cute and funny. It's a touching film about a granddad learning to accept his grandson.  The movie is pretty good for the most part but I do have some complaints.  For one thing, the pop culture references, some are funny but some are cringe worthy.  But don't worry their not long, and they forward the plot.  Now spoiler alert.
I hated how the movie ended, I felt like it was resolved to fast.  I was disappointed on how they just had to include a villian and it was maybe about thirty minutes of showtime at least.  I also hate how Dracula got what he wanted in the end, even after going through so much and just to except his grandson.  He's grandson turned into a vampire at the end but did he really learn anything. Or what about Mavis subplot about being diffrent and wanting to fit in with the humans or accepting that's it's okay to be diffrent, or that humans and monsters can get along. She's just like okay at the end,  then their Johnny who was adorable in the first movie but now he's only around to forward the plot and other times he's just scenery, that really bothered me.  I hated and loved Mavis in this one.  I feel like her character really developed in this one but at the same time it downplays her and I wish she and her father could both learn an important lesson.
Spoiler over.
The animation was better than the original I felt, I half liked the first one but I really like this one. I don't love it but I don't hate it.",1481068800,,2001,4.234210526315789

I passed out at the end of Part One.  My wife was laughing and smiling when I regained consciousness during the final credits, so I assume Part Two was as funny, heartwarming, and entertaining as Part One.",1477612800,,626,4.715596330275229

5746036,4,B00CWZUOV6,"This review is more about the Amazon rental experience than the movie itself. All in all, the rental experience works very much like going to the old brick and mortar, picking a title, checking out, playing it for x days, then returning it. I was unsure about the whole process at first because I didn't know if the title would get clawed back as soon as we finished watching it or what, so I gave it a try. Truth is, they give you 48 hours usage rights and you can watch it over and over if you like. Perfect for the kiddies to enjoy it over a ~3 day span. Best part is, no having to drive to get it and no returning it on time or getting hit for another rental period (yay!).

Okay, that out of the way, the only NEGATIVE I observed is that there is a little ramp-up time to get to HDTV / 1080p video quality. Depending on the kind of movie you watch, it can be annoying to see the upscaled QCIF resolution with serious compression artifacts progress to SD, then to ED, then finally HD over the course of a minute or two if it's the kind of movie that immediately breaks into action instead of rolling a bunch of boring credits first. However, once you're pulling the video down at the full HDTV resolution, it's admittedly way better than one of (and probably their biggest) competitors, which shall go nameless. Actually, compared to said competitor, Amazon's HD blows them out of the water.

We were using our Vizio E48 Smart TV to watch it, so maybe Amazon can work with Vizio (or vice-versa) to make some tweaks to improve the content delivery experience. I'll try streaming from other HD-enabled devices in the future to see if it's consistent or not.",1477267200,2,1659,4.383116883116883

That being said, the ""overbearing parent needing to know when to let go"" theme was done better with Brave, which not only was more original and engaging, it was visually stunning, making Hotel Transylvania's graphics feel a bit 'Scooby-doo'.

5746114,5,B00CWZUOV6,"gave this a complete 5 star because both the son and I (as well as the other movie-goers -going by their reactions) thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning to the very end.
Was it predictable? Of course. Its an animation geared towards children (what would you expect?) -but like most of the animation movies of today, there were quite a few 'hidden humor' spots as well which would be completely missed by the younger audience (not unexpected since it is the adults, after all, who are forking over the bread and it doesn't hurt to keep THEM entertained as well). The movie is fairly fast-paced and the animation well done. I'm usually a little apprehensive when I've harbored good expectations from a movie based on clips/previews, but in this case I felt it truly delivered. This one will be added to our library when it (eventually) hits the shelves. Too many people look for a great amount of depth and unpredictability in animation movies -but THAT is a bit unrealistic (no pun intended) -think about it: These things USED to be called CARTOON MOVIES for a reason. They weren't intended to fit that kind of expectation. They ARE intended to be fun -and this movie is just that: FUN.",1474243200,8,1189,4.69377990430622

5746420,5,B00CWZUOV6,"My wife and I are both suckers for this type of movie.  I'm very glad to say Hotel Transylvania did not leave us wanting or let us down.  This is both a cute and funny movie.

In a nutshell, Count Dracula's ""Little Daughter Mavis"" has a coming of age 118th birthday party.  All the monsters are at the hotel, safe in the midst of nowhere.  What Mavis wants most is freedom.  But like any dad, dear old Drac doesn't want his little girl to actually grow up and move out. Bleh-bleh, bleh.

Human, Jonathan, a free spirited young man somehow finds himself at the hotel.  This is a definite no-no as humans are NOT allowed.  This is the last bastion of safety for monsters.

What transpires during course of the film is Dracula letting go his baby to her womanhood.  If it were not for the ""monsters,"" and by no means are they scary except maybe the very young or some children who do not really have a grip on reality, this could be any movie at all.  The message, regardless of how it was presented, is the same.  A father's love is uncondltional and only daughter is the apple of his eye.",1464393600,3,1087,4.295566502463054

5746448,5,B00CWZUOV6,"Very Funny!  Definitely worth a watch.  Also check out Hotel Transylvania 2.  These movies were written for kids and adults.  As far a kids movies go, I would watch Hotel Transylvania all day over a classic Disney movie.  As an adult, I was laughing at the kids jokes and the adult jokes/references.  Adam Sandler co-wrote and stars as Dracula along with a ton of famous actors/actresses doing the voices and they all deliver!  If you have seen any Adam Sandler movies, you will notice that he likes to cast his friends...good thing they are all hilarious!  Our whole family loves Hotel Transylvania, but we actually prefer Hotel Transylvania 2 (funnier and we like the story better).",1463875200,,684,4.836206896551724

5746564,5,B00CWZUOV6,"My 4 year old loves monsters, and Hotel Transylvania is now his favorite. And that is great, because my wife and I really enjoy watching it too! This movie has managed to create funny characters that will appeal to both kids and adults, such as the over-protecting vampire father, the worn-out werewolf father-of-many and the brainless and energetic couple in love.

The pace of the movie is FAST, with almost not a second to breathe between one scene or joke and the next one, which makes re-watching the movie same as enjoyable as the first time.

Only side note: do not expect the movie to make a lot of sense, and be prepared for many inconsistencies. I had to put my nerd side to sleep while the vampires were walking in the daylight or looking at the sun (without it burning their eyes). It is a kids movie, so just relax and enjoy!",1461369600,6,838,4.470588235294118

5746712,5,B00CWZUOV6,"Loved this movie!! The price was right, it came way sooner than quoted, during Christmas too! That's Amazing.
Now for you true blue movie critics,  I will remind you that it is an Adam Sandler movie (not meant to be taken seriously, literally, and please for heavens sake, DO NOT TAKE IT PERSONALLY)
I adored it for the story line that put the sweetest twist on an old tale. My son loved it for the flatulence jokes that almost make him choke he laughs so hard, and I have never seen a 2yr old walk around saying, ""I am Dracula bla bla bla""
As a mother that has loved Adam Sandler my whole life, to really see how much of a father he really is, I love it. If you are not a fan of Adam Sandler and gang, or old monster movies, I would pick something else.",1456790400,7,754,4.094594594594595

5746738,2,B00CWZUOV6,"Released in 2012, HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is an animated spoof on such classic horror characters as Dracula, Frankensteins monster, the werewolf, and the mummy.  Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) is the widowed father of Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez), and he seeks to protect her from the outside world by creating Hotel Transylvania, a vacation spot for monsters who have come to fear those nasty pitch-fork-carrying, torch-bearing humans.  But on Mavis one hundred eighteenth birthday, her party is crashed by a mortal named Jonathan (Andy Samberg)and he and Mavis fall in love at first sight.

I usually like animated features, but I found HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA an uphill battle.  The animation is technically acceptable, and some of the designs are original and rather fun, but the movie overall is dull as dish water, unimaginative, and frequently vulgar in an unamusing way.  Sander sounds less like Dracula than I do when Im drunk, and the other voice actors are commonplace at best.  I suppose children of a certain age will love the thing, but there are many better animated movies out there for them.  Get one of them and toss this one in the garbage.

5746900,1,B00CWZUOV6,"The horror theme (Dracula and his daughter are the main characters, hosting a function for monsters) isn't something I'd normally gravitate towards, and some find it objectionable for children, but it's easy enough to overlook, and can hardly be taken too seriously.  In many respects the film is actually quite funny, although at times the humour is too crude and crass.

But the real issue here is the moral message that comes sugar-coated with the laughs: follow your feelings.  The film deals with the idea of parents letting go of their children (Dracula's daughter turns 18), but deals with this noble theme in a very unhealthy way.  The main message is that young adults should follow their feelings, and if they get a ""zing"" (as Dracula's daughter does in a forbidden relationship), then it's good and right.  Parents are outdated and don't know what real fun is anyway.  Life is about living for the moment and exploring the world, and following the zings that happen.

This is terrible advice for the real world.  Feelings are rarely reliable, and sometimes have destructive consequences, and that's why young people need advice and guidance from parents, who have the benefit of wisdom and experience.  In the film it is the father who looks like the idiot and ends up apologizing to his daughter, whereas really what our world needs is a generation of youth who are more willing to take the advice of their seniors more seriously and who learn the disciplines of self-control and self-denial.  This film boldly proclaims the values of living for the moment and following your feelings, disregarding authority if necessary, and unfortunately this theme could hardly be stated more openly or clearly.

A cleverly made film, but the main message is one that illustrates all that is wrong with Hollywood and with the modern West. Clearly I'm in the minority with this viewpoint, but given that this is the conclusion that zinged with me, even the film itself would defend my right to this alternative perspective, even if it's not a popular one.  - GODLY GADFLY (January 2016)",1453766400,,2084,4.922857142857143

Recommend the movie for 4-5 yr olds and up. It has a lot of fun humor but some of it may need to be explained to younger kids, like why a vampire would want to kill a bunch of ""pretend"" town humans--young kids may not get the ""pretend"" part. Also when the girl jumps off the roof of the castle...an adult will know she will eventually turn into a bat & not be hurt/killed--small kids may not, or on the flip side a small child may want to try it for themselves thinking they can turn into a bat. Kids minds are very simple and adults often forget this.",1451433600,2,701,4.043165467625899

5747095,5,B00CWZUOV6,"This is a true boy meets girl with an overprotective father. Oh, the father is a vampire, so is the girl. The can both fly. The boy has monster envy issues. Did I mention they meet in a haunted castle? It's a fun, fun movie, my whole family (two semi-adult 40 year olds, a 12 year old, 10 year old and a 9 year old) can still sit down to it and get a laugh all the way through. We play this every Halloween after the kids are done with trick-or-treat and coming in for hot dogs and popcorn (and candy).

My favorite character is the little girl werewolf who fortunately has a major part in the next movie - the only kid who still has some respect for her dad. Sigh.

We are a family who loves our movies, any kind of movie that is okay for kids. This is a great one.",1449619200,,766,3.9675324675324677

5747197,5,B00CWZUOV6,"Hilarious. I actually was boycotting animated movies because when my kids were little, that's all they (and we) watched. Now they're grown so I've gone back to grown-up movies. My husband and I were invited to a work party where they rented the theater for the employees and their families. We went to be good sports and ended up laughing louder than anyone through the entire movie. We got the jokes the little kids didn't. Adam Sandler is quite talented. The script writers and animators got it right with this one. We bought the DVD and watched it on Halloween with our daughter. She loved it, too. Maybe just a little hard to follow for the very young but they'd enjoy the animation even if they didn't get the script. It leaves you smiling. P.S. Hotel Transylvania 2 is just as good.",1447977600,,788,4.556338028169014

When it was in theaters I had no interest in watching it, and even after it was released on DVD I still avoided it because I thought it looked kind of stupid...

5747260,5,B00CWZUOV6,"We ordered HT as a 24-hour rental for the family, and we ended up watching it twice.  There are the obligatory ""bathroom humor"" jokes (which, as parents, we'd prefer were not included) with a film with the PG rating, but the overall presentation is family-friendly.  Also, a central theme of the film is romance and first kiss which would have caused me concern when our tweener was a couple of years younger, but the drama is less intense than some Nickelodeon offerings aimed at teens.  The voice characterizations, the action & humor bits, and the overall plot were very good.  I look forward to watching HT II soon.",1447200000,,619,4.703703703703703

5747309,5,B00CWZUOV6,"We rented this for halloween to watch with our 2 year old. We love family movies, this one was no exception. He loved it and wanted to watch it over and over again. It actually has a couple different lessons in this movie that I think are important for toddlers and young children. The first lesson is about acceptance and diversity is that people who are different than you aren't scary, even if people like them weren't nice to you, that this person might be different. It also shows that monsters aren't mean, which is important for toddlers as they start to be afraid of the dark, we are trying to teach him that monsters aren't mean. That way even if his imagination starts making them up, he doesn't have to be scared, that's the hope anyways.
Overall this movie is great for kids, appropriate even for toddlers, and has enough humor to engage mom and dad, too, all the ingredients for an awesome family movie. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",1446768000,,963,4.540229885057471

5747476,5,B00CWZUOV6,"This movie has a little of everything, for everyone.  I rate this the highest possible 5 out of 5 stars.  The reason behind this is simple; Hotel Transylvania is simply perfect.  The story is one of acceptance, which is a great one not only for our children, but as a reminder for adults.  The animation is top notch.  Hilarious references are strung throughout the movie.  There is enough going on to keep adults entertained; and children will be busting at the seams at this movie.

ANIMATION: 5/5 Stars.  I watched the Blu Ray version just now (10/28/2015).  It was incredibly dazzling.  The attention to detail really makes the ""monster"" feel POP, and when the transformations for Count Dracula and Mavis occur (from vampire to bat), it is a spectacle to behold.

SOUND:  5/5 Stars.  The sound was amazing. I could hear every minute detail; from the skeletal mariachi band playing, to the whirs and movement of the characters.  They did not miss a beat when it came to the sound for Hotel Transylvania.  The voice acting was top notch; as would be expected.  Adam Sandler and crew really did a spectacular job of bringing their characters to life.  The level of energy and emotion is one to behold.

STORYLINE:  5/5 Stars.  The story line for Hotel Transylvania is set on the notion of acceptance and love.  With the chaotic world we see far too often (IE: Turn on the news for 20 minutes), this is a valuable lesson for children, and oftentimes we as adults need the reminder.  The movie never has a dull moment, and is constantly moved along with humor, references and more.  I never once had a moment where I wanted the movie to end; it was just the opposite. I never wanted it to end.  When Mavis and Jonathan realize that they match each others ""zing"", my heart beat fast in my chest.  I'm a 30 year old male who practices and competes in MMA. So that tells you something; this movie moves you.

REPLAY VALUE:  5/5 Stars.  I could watch this movie again and again. That is why I never rented it. I went out and bought it.  It is one that will sit perfectly well with my collection of other holiday themed movies, such as Nightmare Before Christmas.  I could watch this any time of the year.

OVERALL:  5/5 Stars.  Don't just take my word for it, go out and get Hotel Transylvania.  I can assure you, you will not be disappointed.  This is a movie that wrapped it all up perfectly and gives you that ""feel good"" aura which is so rare nowadays.",1445990400,,2451,4.493181818181818

5747497,2,B00CWZUOV6,"Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) has a daughter he wants to protect from all the horrible humans in the world, so he has a special castle built out in the middle of a spooky woods where no sensible human would ever go. The castle is also a hotel that welcomes all monsters. It's a safe retreat from the real world. Every year he holds a birthday party for his daughter Mavis and invites all his monster pals to come celebrate. This particular party is Mavis's 118th birthday--she's old enough to drive a hearse and wants to explore the rest of the world. Dracula knows how dangerous it is, so he constructs a fake village near the castle and has his hotel workers (who are zombies) masquerade as despicable humans to scare her into not going any further into the real world. The plan works, except a plucky young human hiker named Jonathan spots the village and follows the zombies back to the castle. When he walks in the front door, Dracula has a problem--if his guests discover a human at the castle, it's the end of Hotel Transylvania. A second problem develops--Jonathan (disguised as a monster) and Mavis hit it off. What could be worse?

The plot unfolds in a predictable fashion as Dracula goes through various shenanigans to keep the secret about Jonathan and break up the romantic feelings developing between his daughter and a human. The movie is aimed at children, so perhaps it isn't so bad that the plot is obvious. I found it a bit uninteresting and started noticing other things, like scenes that were clearly designed as 3D, which are less impressive in 2D. Or Adam Sandler's performance, which is lackluster. Dracula runs into several people who say, ""You're Dracula, so you say 'bleh, bleh, bleh!'"" which he vehemently denies, though he exhibits every other Dracula cliche (except for the sexiness, thankfully).  There wasn't anything particularly memorable or interesting about any of the other monsters or the few humans in the story.

Maybe all of this would have been less noticeable to me if the characters were more endearing or the movie had been funnier. BBC film reviewer Mark Kermode has a ""six laugh test"" for a comedy. I'm sure I didn't laugh six times, but the children I saw it with (at the kids' school) laughed more than I did. A few risqu jokes are thrown in to entertain the grown ups but I didn't hear any grown ups laughing at those.

This movie was a disappointing to me. I was expecting more creativity or maybe a more daring theme than ""tolerate others who are different from you."" If you want a kid-friendly horror animated movie, there are plenty of better ones like Coraline, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or Halloween is Grinch Night.",1445817600,,2682,4.712153518123667

5748250,4,B00CWZUOV6,"When this movie first hit theaters, I fully admit to thinking that it looked incredibly stupid -- another run-of-the-mill ""zany"" animated movie with nothing special going for it.  The fact that Adam Sandler starred in it and hand a hand in the script further turned me off, as I'm not a fan of the man's sense of humor or acting skills (or lack thereof), and can only stand him in a handful of movies (""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates"").  But previews for the sequel looked decent, and when I discovered that Genndy Tartakovsky, the man behind ""Samurai Jack"" and the 2D ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" cartoons, was the director, I decided to give it a shot.  Perhaps Tartakovsky's influence would overcome Sandler's?

My misgivings were largely unfounded, and while a few things crop up at the end of the movie that irritate me, overall this is a cute, hilarious, and unexpectedly heartwarming movie.

""Hotel Transylvania"" is the domain of the infamous Count Dracula -- but in this retelling he's not a villainous monster, but a loving father who has established a sanctuary where monsters can find a safe refuge from the human world... and where he can raise Mavis, his daughter.  Monsters from all over the world are coming to the hotel to celebrate Mavis' 118th birthday, but Mavis is chafing under her father's overprotective vigilance and wants to explore the human world on her own.  Drac's scheming to keep her from going outside the castle has some unexpected results, as he accidentally brings Jonathan, an adventurous backpacker, into the hotel.  Drac struggles to keep Jonathan's identity as a human secret... but Jonathan has plans to spice up Mavis' birthday party, plans that will bring chaos, hilarity, and new understanding to the monsters of Hotel Transylvania... and perhaps romance to Mavis' life.

The plot sounds fairly clich -- a human ends up among non-humans (or vice versa) and has to disguise himself to prevent discovery and chaos.  But ""Hotel Transylvania"" pulls it off well.  The monsters of this movie aren't very monstrous at all, and in fact are more terrified of Jonathan and his kind than he is of them.  And the movie doesn't hesitate to poke fun at the clichs of the monster genre, getting in some funny digs at classic vampire and monster myths, the classic Hammer horror films, and even modern-day vampire franchises like ""Twilight.""  (""This is how we're represented?  Unbelievable."")

The visual style of the movie is a lot of fun too.  Colors are vivid and vibrant, characters are stylized without being rendered unrecognizable, and the animation is quick and energetic without being jerky (a flaw found in quite a few CGI movies, especially the ""Madagascar"" films).  Great visuals, smooth animation, and a distinct and unique visual style are trademarks of Tartakovsky's, and it's great to see him continue that here.

Like many modern animated films, this one features a cast full of celebrities, but the inclusions don't feel forced or obnoxious.  Indeed, if it wasn't for the fact that his name was prominently featured in the advertising, I might not have guessed that Adam Sandler voiced Dracula.  His accent is a bit all over the place, but other than that he does a good job of voicing one of the most iconic monsters of all time, and brings both heart and humor to the role.  I didn't realize other celebrity voices (Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi, CeeLo Green, Jon Lovitz, and Tom Kenny) were present until watching the credits -- they did that good a job at making them fit the characters.  David Spade and Fran Drescher were more recognizable, but then, they have much more distinctive voices, and they still fit their respective characters (The Invisible Man and Frankenstein's Bride) very well.

If I have any nitpicks with this movie, they come up toward the end.  First, a lot of emphasis is placed on finding your ""zing"" -- your one true love -- but only in the last half-hour or so of the film.  First of all, putting so much emphasis on ""you only get one zing in your life"" can make watching the movie uncomfortable for anyone who's come from a divorced family.  If a ""zing"" only applies to monsters, that's a bit more forgivable, but the movie should specify.  That, and if finding your ""zing"" is so important, it should have been brought up earlier instead of left for the end.

Second, the movie ends with a DreamWorks-style musical number that just makes me cringe watching it.  My advice is to stop or at least mute the movie once the musical number starts.  Just me, though...

Overall, ""Hotel Transylvania"" was a lot better than I was expecting, and I know for sure I'll be checking out the sequel.  It might not be good for very young kids (despite the monsters being cute, there ARE some scary moments, and Sandler being Sandler there are still a few naughty jokes), but it's still a good choice for a non-spooky Halloween movie for the family.",1440460800,,4910,4.801426872770511
5748251,4,B00CWZUOV6,My 1st grader chose this one after watching the preview. She didn't get all of the jokes but there was definitely enough that she got a good laugh out of. Fun family flick that shows monsters aren't so scary after all.,1440374400,,218,4.341463414634147

5748303,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Starting with the bad first. This is actually the second time I had to rent the movie. The first time, Playback crapped out on me halfway through and refused to reload. I had buffering issues with a lot of things I have rented recently, and Amazon seemed to automatically refund me those, so I can't complain too loudly, but having to double dip for a bad rental is always annoying.

As a rule, I try to actively avoid Adam Sandler. Can't stand him, or his so-called comedy. On his own, his own production, direction, and casting, he has no one to keep him in check and the whole thing feels like a train wreck. But here, at least, There was enough straight-lacing to keep him distracted, and the rest of the cast were quite enjoyable. I liked his over-protective Count, and the whole of the Monster Culture seemed believeable enough. True to form, there was still a lot of background clutter. Particularly, the Werewolf pack was a too-often used running gag that felt more distractive and (fittingly, I suppose) destructive to the storyline than actually funny, but its not hard to see past. If you like Adam Sanler though, and want something funny, with a dash of cute and just a little bit sad for 45 seconds, Give it a spin.",1439337600,,1228,4.5565610859728505

After it was half way done, I got board.  It's about Dracula, his daughter, some nerdy kid, a mummy, and Frankeinstine.  This show was SOOO bad that I forgot who the characters names are..  Uuhh, oh right, uh, yeah the whole movie is in Hotel Transylvania, which is a hotel for monsters.  Dracula invites all the monsters to the hotel to celebrate his daughters Birthday.  The movie could have been good, but the editors wanted to make it filled with jokes and laughs.  They did add the Invisibal Man, but half of the time he's on screen, you can barley seen his glasses.  When you can see him, he seems to be slouching?  What the-?  And then they add a normal, human boy who finds the hotel and falls in love with Draculas daughter.  Uh, ok... odd.  Then they have this dumb thing: ""You are Dracula, blah blah, blah?""  ""I don't do, blah blah, blah.""  At the end, it ends.  Nothing good.  Seen the trailer for the second one?  Don't watch it.

It's the family charm between the characters and how we all get along in our own lives that drives this to the top of my list.
Lacking support for the mother figure only makes the father figure all the more vibrant.  However, as much as I would love a strong mother figure in movies overall (whole different subject), I find nothing but great times in here.

Dracula is re-imagined as an exclusive hotelier and overprotective single father with serious control issues.

What did I think?

Much like a complimentary hotel toiletry kit, Hotel Transylvania was serviceable in a pinch but ultimately disposable.

The tired and unimaginative story was balanced out by reasonable pacing and a few cute, monster-related call-backs. Kids in the audience seemed to get a kick out of the fart jokesand shamefully, so did the big kid in me. Not really for everyone.",1431734400,,512,5.2073170731707314

5748768,5,B00CWZUOV6,"ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! I have no idea why anyone would say this movie was less than 5 stars... We have watched this probably 20 times over the course of a few months and each time it plays, there is something else hidden in the film we discover. From creative writing to incredible casting, the Producers combine everything you want into a great script, fast humor, and cute characters you fall in love with. It is riddled with adult humor that the kids easily ignore but we pick up on instantly... My favorite scene in the whole movie is the construction site, where the female zombie walks in front of the male workers... OMG just too hilarious. This has to be my favorite movie of all time and I can't wait to see the sequel... And in regards to my review ""Don't judge me!""

5748773,3,B00CWZUOV6,"Those crazy, crazy monsters.  Scared of humans.  Getting all tied up in family issues.  Needing to have a soiree every once in a while.  Hotel Transylvania is a safe animated entry that one could easily play at Halloween time for the kiddies.  It offers the usual family-fed and friendly storylines as: a lone father being overprotective toward his coming-of-age daughter who simply longs to see the world; teenage love; stranger danger; none of us are really as bad as we seem to each other as long as we only give each other half a chance; and so on and so forth.  Adam Sandler voices overprotective daddy Dracula whose vampish daughter Mavis (who names their daughter Mavis?!?) is turning her sweet 116 and is busting to get out of the house and see the world.  Sandler infuses his Dracula with a lot of his nebbishy and spastic self so this Drac is less a threat than a Big Daddy.  He invites all of his monster pals to come and celebrate his schmoopies birthday and the usual mad, mad monster party (sans King Kong) shows up.  Kevin James voices Dracs best bud, Frank(ensteins monster), and a droll Steve Buscemi wears his worn out hairshirt as the voice of the Wolfman.  (I think that Buscemi, who doesnt have a lot of screen time, is the best of the voice cast personally.)  Andy Samberg voices free spirit human Jonathan as an undimmed dimwit, a free spirit who is traveling solo through the eastern European woodlands.  Out of the entire cast Sambergs doofy Jonathan, who has to pretend that hes a monster so as not to scare all of the guests, is the funniest and most interesting character in the cast.  Thats too bad considering that hes the only human

Theres not a lot thats really funny or even particularly good about this film, nor is there anything thats bad.  Its serviceable.  Youngsters (and oldsters) who like their scary Universal monsters may enjoy this slightly more, but I kind of doubt it.  Theres no scare in this hotbed hotel, and it doesnt have much bite.",1420761600,,1984,4.622857142857143

5748930,4,B00CWZUOV6,"This was my first time renting a movie on Amazon, and the choice was a good one.  My 11 yr old and I enjoyed it very much.  It's funny and has a lot of recognizable monsters.  We especially enjoyed the werewolf family - they were hilarious.  The story is a kid growing up and parent not wanting to let go theme, plus star crossed lovers situation added.  The price of this rental was very low and it was a fun way to spend some family time together.

There is a sad part to the plot revealed toward the end, and it's heavy stuff that would probably be very upsetting for a small child.  As with most of the Disney movies, this movie has a one parent situation, but it's how the other parent died that is really awful, so I wouldn't suggest this for little ones at all.  I'm more conservative than a lot of parents I know, however, so maybe I am overestimating the age group it's right for.

There's some bathroom type humor, which is almost always found in kids' movies; I could really do without it, but I am considered uptight about that by everybody else in our family.  I just find that sort of thing more gross than funny.  There was a bit of risque innuendo humor that could have been left out, but nothing too obnoxious.  The things that some might find objectionable are the same types of things found in most kids' movies anymore.  This one certainly doesn't have as much as a lot of other movies I've seen that are meant for the same audience.",1414800000,12,1453,4.297794117647059

It's funny without being scary (for the little ones), and it keeps both adults and kids engaged throughout the entire film.

Basically, everyone at Hotel Transylvania is getting ready for the girl's 118th birthday party and The Invisible Man, who is in the shower, powders the upper parts of his erect p_n_s.  It is a short clip but the image remains on screen long enough for an adult to be stunned that it's in there. Amazon was great about refunding our purchase, but it was very disappointing to us that Adam Sandler (who both produces and stars in the movie) would approve the inclusion of that content in a movie that is obviously going to be watched by a lot of small children.  Language, mild violence and innuendo in a PG rated movie are one thing; explicit content is something entirely different. Very sad.",1413763200,8,892,4.5625

This is a typical ""parent protecting their child and boy meets girl"" but there never was any underlying innuendos that might make a parent uncomfortable. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars was when the monsters were making their entrance. It was a bit too fast. I only watched it once but all the monsters zipping by ave me a headache.

A world shy vampire has a child that he wants to protect from the tragedy he has seen happen to his kind, builds a world of everything a kid would want, that is, except for freedom. When she wants to get out, and has been for a while, a new cog is added to Drac's perfect machine and conveniently in the form of a fun loving freedom chasing young dude (would say man, but he's totally a dude). Fun happens, growth ensues and you have one really fun kid friendly Halloween themed cartoon.",1410739200,,583,4.214285714285714

5749108,3,B00CWZUOV6,Great movie and great bluray - but...ultraviolet digital copy is a joke. The reason for a digital copy I so that you can put the movie on your device (iPad in this case) and watch it when not on wifi. Ultraviolet doesn't allow for that. Or at least not that I can figure. And the movies don't show in the normal videos section on the iPad. So my daughter can't access them when she wants to. Really a poor system. One we will avoid at all costs in the future.,1405296000,,459,4.111111111111111

My reason for not giving it four stars is that Selena Gomez pretty much ruined the role she played. her inability to project emotion or make her character lively (I know she's a vampire but you'll know what I mean if you see the movie) is just plain sad. Honestly they should have re-casted her, her acting is dry. If your Flying away and shouting ""Weeeeeee!"" let's have some fun with it, not just let's read the script. Just plain embarrassing for actors everywhere. Adam Sandler slips a few times with his accent but not very bad, and to be honest I forgot he was even playing Dracula till he slipped. You should rent it first some where first and see it for your self before purchase. I loved it other than Selena you may think otherwise.",1403740800,,910,4.3274853801169595

The story makes sense.  The characters are all charming.  The comedy is perfect for a family movie: not too dull, not too corny.

The voice-acting is superb, bringing these characters to LIFE.  You can lose yourself in appreciating all of the weird monsters gathered together.  Well-done.  Their personalities make you laugh.

And of course the visuals are excellent.  The animation is perfect, adds to the comedy, and really hooks you.  There is a lot to look at in some scenes.

Hotel Transylvania is a pleasure to watch.  Great for kids who love movies like Monsters Inc., Monsters University, How To Train Your Dragon, and Despicable Me.

5749149,5,B00CWZUOV6,"***This review may contain spoilers***
In case you weren't a Saturday-morning cartoon show freak during the 70s, the Groovie Ghoulies was a Hal Sutherland/Filmation animated production featuring nice, family friendly versions of Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster, and the Wolfman (Drac, Frankie, and Wolfie respectively) plus a few other legendary monsters.  The cartoons spotlighted their wacky, episodic adventures in a castle called Horrible Hall and also in the real world  or at least the world of Archie, Veronica, Betty, Reggie, and Jughead.  They also did Laugh-In jokes and skits.

Hotel Transylvania (hereafter H-Trans) borrows a fair amount of that 60ish, freestyle Groovie Ghoulies vibe (plus the vibes of movies like The Croods, Monsters vs. Aliens, and even the Harry Potter series, and of course TV series like The Addams Family and The Munsters).  But thats good, because H-Trans uses its borrowings skillfully to spin out a wildly enjoyable, supersonic story about an extended nuclear monster family.

The main theme revolves around widower Count Draculas (Adam Sandler ) frantic efforts to safeguard his only child, surprisingly fetching  and independent-willed vampire daughter named Mavis (Selena Gomez) from the ignorant terrors of the human world.  Having reached the age of monster maturity (118, or 18 in human years), Mavis is eager to explore the mysterious world beyond the creepy, eerie walls of Draculas castle.  However, Dracula goes to extravagant lengths, even fabricating a Balkan village populated by the undead pretending to be hostile humans, to keep Mavis safe at home.  Beyond that, Dracula has renovated his castle to be a hotel/retreat/refuge for all sorts of kooky, domesticated monsters, from good-natured husband Frank (Kevin James) and his nagging wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), to harried wolfman Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and his pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their unruly canine brood, to the narcissistic, bespectacled Invisible Man (David Spade), to obese but hip and swaggering mummy Murray (CeeLo Green), plus practically every other monster in creation.

To keep the meddling humans out, Dracula has converted the hotel/castle into a seemingly impenetrable, booby-trapped fortress.  Nevertheless, a back-packing surfer dude type named Jonathan (Andy Samburg) stumbles into the castle and is somewhat terrified by but far more curious about the place and its odd denizens.  Aghast, Dracula tries EVERYTHING he can to either hide the human Jonathan from his suspicious guests, especially Mavis, or to disguise him as Franks right-hand cousin Johnnystein, who is also a party planner.  Of course, this fails and Jonathan and Mavis meet and find a zing of love and affection exists between them, so much so that in a calm, sweet break from the action, they climb to the hotel roof and Jonathan shows Mavis her first sunrise from beneath the shade of a chimney, since of course vampires and sunlight are not friends.

Eventually even the obstinate Count and his guests realize that Jonathan is a pretty decent, trustworthy fellow, especially for a human, and knows how to liven up a bunch of cool, party-hearty but somewhat out-of-touch, antiquated monsters.  Dracula even confesses to Jonathan in an emotional sequence how a bunch of torch-and-pitchfork villagers killed his wife and embittered him against humanity. Jonathan and Mavis get closer and even kiss (which bugs Dracula so much his face turns red and his fangs grow, which always cracked me up) and may even start on a path of wedded independence.

But chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz), instead of his expected gentle personality, reveals a nasty but funny desire to serve Jonathan for dinner.  Naturally, this drives Jonathan away from the castle.  Formerly biased and cautious Dracula (and company) must now brave the outside human world AND daylight to intercept Jonathans airplane flight from Transylvania and convince him to return.  Can he do it, and reunite him with Mavis?

As I said, H-Trans is a supersonic, roller-coaster delight of a monster movie that will almost give you a whiplash.  Despite the pace, however, the movie is a clever, respectful homage AND parody of famous monsters (even the Twilight vampires) which also obtains its laughs from common domestic themes such as parent-child interactions, the search for autonomy and freedom, the need to let someone you love go and find his/her destiny, and the unexpected power of forgiveness.  H-Trans also displays its humor through sharp dialogue and one-liners, slapstick pratfalls, and juvenile humor.  In other words, just about anyone, from ADD patients to reasonably sophisticated cinema lovers, can find something to like about H-Trans.
These characters, monster and human, lead interesting lives, and deserve a sequel! ",1402012800,,4802,5.3791722296395195

I would be ashamed to have ever given showed it to a child. I watched the first five minutes and its all packed with action and effects, but you just know the storyline is totally stupid.

5749185,5,B00CWZUOV6,"HOTEL TRANSYLVANIYA

I knew when this film was announced I was going to like it. First the story is about all the classic monsters, second it had a cast I loved. People like Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, and David Spade among many more had me excited for this. Plus who doesnt like a good animated film, I for one love them. So when it was released to theaters we loaded up with my little cuz and went to see it. Turns out we all loved it, especially when Drac freaks out and the screen goes red [u know what I am talking about].

The film tells the story of Dracula who after his wife was killed many moons ago decided that all humans were evil. So he decided to build a place that would keep his daughter and fellow monster safe from the outside world. This place was called Hotel Transylvania and all was right with the world, until the outside world made its way in. When a human kid named Jonathan shows up and Dracs daughter Mavis takes an interest in him things in Draculas world turns upside down.

This was a fun movie that featured all the classic monsters plus many more and all of them are great. Also add in that the voice acting and writing is great and you got a good film. The only thing left you need is the animation, thankfully it is wonderful here. Sony made sure of that with Happy Madison and had the film directed by the creator of Samurai Jack and Dexters Laboratory, love both of those shows. The Blu-Ray/DVD combo comes with all kinds of bonus features including a great audio commentary.

This was a great movie and it was wonderful to hear that a sequel was in the works. I highly recommend this Adam Sandler and company animated film. I always had wondered if Happy Madison would do another animated film after Eight Crazy Nights. I am glad they did and cant wait for the next, which will be the second film in this series.",1397692800,,1850,4.322766570605188

5749267,3,B00CWZUOV6,Over Rated with nothing original.  These animated movies nowadays follow the same cookie-cutter characteres and humor. This could've been far more fun and memorable.,1390608000,,165,5.875
5749268,5,B00CWZUOV6,Exactly the quality humor you would expect from Adam Sandler.  So funny!  Cute story. A little mild humor.  My kids and I all loved it.,1390608000,,135,4.32
5749269,5,B00CWZUOV6,As far as the movie goes it's very cute and an instant Halloween watch at our house.  The DVD's are everything you would expect Blu ray/DVD and Ultra Violet.  The UV version is great and is extremely easy to get with the provided instructions.  Great movie! I definitely recommend it!!,1390435200,,285,4.66

(And we have, and we are still not tired of it.. Blah. Bla. Blah).  You know a movie it good when family members go about quoting it.

Two big thumbs up.  No real language issues that I can think of.  No nudity or hints of it.  The cartoon violence is very mild if any at all.

All in all, its quite a gem.  Adam Sandler and his team did a great job on this.  5 stars.  No doubt.",1390348800,,546,3.8636363636363638

5749272,4,B00CWZUOV6,"I enjoyed this movie and I showed it to my classroom.  Theme ""it is ok to be different""
is always current.  I like the single dad, different members of family and extended family,
hard times to be a young teen, lots and lots of different sides to this movies.
AND it was fun just to watch it with a bowl of popcorn.  Young children will like the animation,
older children will like action, adults will like the writing.
All in all a fun movie.",1390089600,5,443,4.25

After seeing it in the theater, I had to buy it. It was very entertaining. This movie was quite funny and even had some jokes way over the kids' heads (David Spade's line about the water being cold ironic since he was the invisible man). The father-daughter relationship also can really hit home.

Watch the movie and look up the cast on IMDB. It's fun to put the voice with the actors. I slowly recognized actor voices in the theater, but could not place them all. I was so frustrated until the movie ended and I could see the credits.",1387929600,,670,4.403225806451613

I'm a 50 year old father of two daughters. I found myself recalling feelings I had as I watched my daughters Grow into young women. I have watched this movie three times in the past two months because it makes me laugh. When it's done and the expected happy end comes... guess what? I'm happy.

The people who want to compare this with Gone With the Wind, or another, is going to be disappointed. Geez, get some perspective people! It's an animated movie that gives you a chance to relax, unwind, and have a good time.

5749345,2,B00CWZUOV6,"When I decided to watch this film, I did so because I love old monster movies and because it was directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, whose work I have admired for some time.

However, this film is ultimately a disappointment, because it boils down to just being another movie for Adam Sandler and his friends. Almost all of the  main characters are voiced by people that Sandler regularly works with, like Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, Jon Lovitz. etc. Now this doesn't mean the acting is bad. The actors in this film do a good enough acting job to suspend your disbelief...or they would have were it not for Adam Sandler voicing Count Dracula.

This is my main complaint of the film. You could not have picked a worse person to voice Count Dracula. I realize that in this film, Dracula is not the devilishly charming demon in disguise, but rather a comedic overprotective father, but still, I can't get past the fact that every time he opens his mouth, I don't believe it's Dracula. Sandler is doing his best impression of Bela Lugosi, although that's not saying much since it's probably one of the WORST Lugosi impressions I've ever heard, and the bottom line is that I just can't accept Adam Sandler's voice as Count Dracula. So that basically soiled the film for me from the very start.

Like I said in the title, this film is basically an animated version of ""The Grown-Ups"", except the characters are monsters. and SURPRISE SURPRISE, several of the actors from ""The Grown-Ups"" are in this movie! Who would have thought? If I had to sum this film up in one word, it would be: Immature.

The film relies heavily on slapstick, fart jokes, puns, and stereotypes. Which I found genuinely surprising, because when your premise is a hotel that has monsters from all over the world coming to visit, it seems like there is a near ENDLESS potential of jokes there that can reference the classic films. And to be fair, the film does do that....very sparingly.

I will give the film praise for being beautifully animated. The castle/hotel is superbly rendered and the characters are well-designed and move realistically (for a slap-stick comedy), but to be honest? That's not good enough. It's one thing to say a film is technically and visually beautiful, but unless you're the ONLY studio bringing out that level of quality, it's not good enough. The script is juvenile. So no matter how well the animation is done, I still can't help but cringe at the awful jokes and Sandler's grating fake Romanian accent.

To sum up, the movie is for small children. That's it. There's nothing in here for an adult viewer, unless of course you have a very immature sense of humor. So...basically, if you're someone who finds the Grown-Ups movies funny. But if you're sense of humor is a bit more refined, and you want to enjoy a monster themed movie with your kids, there are plenty of good ones that you can enjoy as well, like Monsters Inc. (or it's prequel), The Nightmare Before Christmas, or even Frankenweenie.

But this? This was a complete waste of my time and money. The only reason I'm giving it two-stars is because of my praise for the art and competent animation (I'm actually considering buying the art book, because I'd like to see how the film was panning out in it's developmental stages and see ""what could have been"")",1384819200,2,3326,4.692967409948542

5749408,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Mavy's life is full of monsters. Her dad is Dracula, and he created the Hotel Transylvania to protect her from humans. (You could say he's a tad over-protective.) Her friends are mummies, Frankenstein monsters, werewolves, and the like. But daddy's little ghoul is all grown up and ready to explore the world. Then one night the unthinkable happens: a teenage human enters Hotel Transylvania, and he and Mavy fall in love.  It's Drac's worst nightmare, and it's very funny.

I like this movie a lot, enough to want it in my collection, but I do feel it lacks the tension necessary to make this a great movie.

The reason behind Drac's extreme measures for protecting Mavy from humans isn't shown until very late in the movie, which makes it hard to relate to Drac, who is the main character. If that information had come at the start, he would have been easier to identify with, and we would want to see Mavy protected from humans, too. Alternatively, Mavy could have been the main character, because her conflict is real and clear. She wants to explore the world, fall in love, and grow up, but her dear, loving, undead dad won't let her. There's a lot of tension in that. More scenes that brought that out and starting the movie with her growing up, instead of as a baby, could have brought that tension into the movie. I understand why it's done the way it is, though. It's a safe movie for little kids this way, and it does make Adam Sandler the star of the show. Still, this makes it just a fun and funny movie, instead of one that's fun, funny, and really makes you feel.

So get it for the kids if they like monsters that aren't scary, or for yourself if you're an Adam Sandler fan.",1380758400,,1689,4.456310679611651

It saddens me that the music industry force feeds us this talentless mindless crap. There is a world of great music that is our there but unfortunately most people will never get to hear it.

5749458,3,B00CWZUOV6,"Hotel Transylvania is a very DECENT family film, obviously geared toward a younger child audience with some mild attempts to amuse the parents.  You won't want to gouge your eyes out watching it, but it's hardly memorable either.

The acting is good, and the movie starts out well as they introduce the various monsters and play up their unique characteristics and mythology well for laughs, such as Frankenstein's* pyrophobic fear of fire, and Griffin AKA The Invisible Man pulling pranks.  Unfortunately, the movie is quickly mired down by a rebellious teenage love story that's too uninteresting for the kids and too clich&eacute; for the teen/adult crowd.

In all, the whole thing is predictable and overly...okay.  It's not terrible, but not great.  A definite Could See if the kids want to watch something new.

*Actually Frankenstein's monster.  Frankenstein BUILT the monster commonly referred to as Frankenstein.  The filmmakers probably glossed over this point so as not to confuse the kids...and missed an opportunity to make a running gag of people calling him by his ""dad's"" name.",1377388800,,1093,5.2

5749460,3,B00CWZUOV6,"I shouldn't have bought it honestly. Just rent it and watch it like once or twice and you should be good. Unless it really strikes your fancy, this is a very simple (but endearing) story that doesn't really do well with multiple viewings.",1377216000,,238,4.558139534883721
5749461,5,B00CWZUOV6,"MY SON AND I RENTED THIS MOVIE AN HE LOVED IT! WITH ME WORKING AS MUCH AS I DO IT WAS SO NICE TO ORDER THE MOVIE AD HAVE IT COME RIGHT TO OUR DOOR AT A PRICE YOU CANT BEAT! MY SON WAS SO SURPRISED, IT WAS GREAT! NOW WE CAN ENJOY THIS MOVIE ANY TIME. ONE OF MY FAVORITES FOR SURE! :)",1377216000,,282,3.421875
5749462,2,B00CWZUOV6,"I guess this movie would depend on how old your kids are and how easily they are to being scared of some of the typical Halloween characters (Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy ect..) My daughter said she watched this at her summer daycare during a rainy day, the older kids watched a movie during the younger kids nap time.  She is 6....she liked it (so she said) I've tried to watch it with her twice and she was 20 minutes into it and was off coloring and painting, I turned it off because I just thought it was stupid.

I really can't give a great review on it because I didn't watch it all but I can seem where some elements would scare some kids, like I said depending on how old they are and how easily they are scared to those Halloween type characters.  Adam Sandler's voice is very easy to recognize, he's used it before in other movies, it just seemed to me like a thrown together movie to make a few quick bucks.  So 2 stars out of 5, rent it, don't buy it first, give it a shot, maybe it will be something you will like.",1377216000,2,1027,4.171717171717172

5749522,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I have really enjoyed watching the movie with my family; it is an enjoyable viewing - with some interesting undertones.  The voice actors seemed to do a good job picking accents that matched the areas their characters were supposed to come from, and it became an immersive experience.

Simple story.  Father is overprotective of his daughter, so much that he creates a little haven where only his chosen ""friends"" can visit.  Daughter wants her freedom, and to learn more about the world, so the father creates a situation where he thinks he can control who she is exposed to.  Unfortunately, this creates an opportunity for the daughter to meet a boy who is exactly like the people her father feared.  High jinx ensue as father tries to keep boy away, boy tries to learn about girl, and girl falls for guy.",1373414400,,807,4.6879432624113475

5749537,5,B00CWZUOV6,A wonderful charming story that the whole family will enjoy and laugh.  I just recommend it is for older children. Especially because of the four/five scenes when the vampire father gets angry his face truly becomes scary and  gruesome.  Young children under 8 might find it too scary.,1372723200,,285,4.895833333333333

5749554,5,B00CWZUOV6,"My son saw it in the movies and surprisingly, he asked could we order the movie immediately after leaving the theatre, rare for him because he usually says kids movies are ok, or all right.  Avengers is one of the other movies that he wanted to order immediately after seeing the movie",1371600000,,285,4.480769230769231

The colors are bright the jokes are slap-sticky and the lead is a female vampire that longs for the adventure of leaving the nest.  My niece laughed, had to show me scenes, and danced with the music.  I would rank this above Ice Age and a hair below Madagascar films.  the ending was happy and if there is a lesson it would be about not assuming or predicting people's reactions.
6yr old thumbs up!! I would add this to the collection and pass it on as she ages out of it.",1371600000,,547,4.180952380952381

The father's heart is in the right place, but his daughter's heart is drawn toward a human and vampires don't have a good history with humans. Stereotyping judgments are re-examined in light of giving individuals the opportunity to prove their own character.

Imagine my surprise when I found that I liked, even enjoyed, watching it.  Crazier still, I'm keeping it in my collection to watch again.  I'm even looking forward to Hotel Transylvania 2 when it comes out.
True, the story is an aching clich but it's cute, at times even endearing.  (These are not traits you'd expect from an Adam Sandler movie.)  The humor is inconsistent (I could have done without the gratuitous fart joke).  The message is that age-old plea for tolerance.  My favorite character was Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi).

On the whole, I'd have to say this cartoon was ridiculously sweet................and cute.",1371340800,,754,5.024193548387097

I like animation, but I don't often watch the films with monsters. I watch every now and then when I get curious about these types of films being made for children. There is one image I believe would frighten a small child, and song lyrics I guess were supposed to be cute, but I found disgusting. There were also a few fun parts, nice imagery, and I liked the song, Zing. The film teaches a good lesson about making assumptions and there's a message being sent to over-protective parents.

Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast is absolutely hysterical.  There is enough of a humor balance where little kids are very entertained, but adults catch the little nuances that make it so funny.  Appropriate for kids too! (Sometimes ""kids"" movies are more geared towards adults, this one is great for both.)

They have been watching so many vampire movies and TV shows about vampires but they repeatedly ask me to bring it back to the dorm so they can watch it again and again.

It was really cute and funny - I laughed out loud on a number of occasions, to the point that we decided to purchase it. We have watched it a couple of times and I still think it's cute!  It will be a great movie to watch around Halloween every year.",1368403200,,426,3.953488372093023
5749639,3,B00CWZUOV6,"I have not made it through the end of this movie yet, so I guess that speaks volumes about whether  I really like it or not.  I didn't find it funny or endearing and I get the general message about an overprotective but loving father trying to look out for his daughter but this one ranks low in the animated films category in my humble opinion.

**Addendum - February 1, 2014 - Finally watched this movie from start to finish and I decided that I like the movie.  It is not the typical Disney or Pixar fare (translation: geared toward kids with lots of catchy songs) and probably better understood by adults (like Shrek) than kids.  The ending scene is definitely enjoyable because it has a catchy song (one of few in the movie) and my 2 year old loves dancing to it.  All in all, the movie has a sweet message/premise and is family friendly.",1368403200,5,843,4.371794871794871

5749643,5,B00CWZUOV6,Very cute and a little unique how it is told from the standpoint of the dad when it is about the teenage(can 118 be called teenage so long as she's a Dracula's daughter?) daughter falling in love with a--gasp!--human.,1368230400,,217,4.589743589743589

5749650,3,B00CWZUOV6,"I personally don't care for Adam Sandler, but in this case, since I didn't have to look at him, he did OK in simply following a script.

5749653,2,B00CWZUOV6,"Hotel Transylvania could well have been a humorous but thought provoking exercise in prejudice and fear but the message is diluted with obnoxiously-stupid male protagonist and the frequent bouts with bathroom humor.

The idea itself is original.  Count Dracula has built a hotel in Transylvania to house monsters that would not be allowed to survive in a human world.  Yes, the monsters are just as scared of the humans as the humans are of the monsters.  Which brings forth two different plots: Dracula's coming of age daughter wants to leave home and explore the world, but through a ploy by a fearful and overprotective father is scared into staying home; and the hotel is visited by a young collegiate who is traveling alone, with whom Dracula's daughter falls in love, to the dismay of the father,

This is indeed a solid plot except that while Dracula's daughter seems energetic and articulate, the young male collegiate traveler talks like an imbecile and seems to have an IQ lower than your average head of cabbage.  This, I found irritating.  I wondered not only how a smart woman such as Dracula's daughter could fall for such an idiot, but also why modern comedy is forced to rely on stupid men, flatulence, and a male groin kick, particularly in a movie targeted toward children, suggesting that perhaps poking fun at anything else would be deemed politically incorrect and therefore offensive.

This is particularly sad considering the potential this movie had to not only entertain but to convey a wholesome message as well.  Unfortunately, the message was lost in a myriad of obnoxious distractions.",1368057600,2,1614,4.970260223048327

With grown-up movies his humor can be a little crude but it doesn't really offend me. Knowing that's normally how his humor is, I can appreciate how he kept it so clean and young-child-friendly :D, yet very, very amusing for us, the parents. Very much unlike Wreck it Ralph, which made me feel very uncomfortable at different points throughout the movie. See? There CAN be a cool and clean movie for children without unnecessary stuff in it that I would have to explain to my kids and try to keep them from copying.",1367712000,,640,4.432203389830509

There are some rather random parts in the plot, which is yet another variation on the ""Parents-do-stupid-things-to-protect-their-kids"" theme.  Still, one of the better family shows I've seen.

5749707,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Another not amazing, but simple fun kids movie to watch. It's a goofy kids movie that has everything in it you'd expect it to have in terms of storyline, etc. Nothing spectacular about it, but has a few decent catch phrases in it you may remember and repeat afterwards.",1367020800,,269,4.510204081632653

5749713,5,B00CWZUOV6,This was another great CGI film. I find anymore that the animated films are way more entertaining than most of the other releases and I purchase the movie without having seen it before. I was not disappointed in this movie. Good story. Great animation. Very funny. Loved every minute.,1366848000,,284,4.816326530612245

5749743,2,B00CWZUOV6,"While this film wasn't terrible, it certainly wasn't good.  It almost tried too hard to be funny.  However, resorting to crude humor jokes and bad puns isn't a way to win over viewers.  The basis of the entire film is that lying is okay as long as you accomplish what is needed.  What a message to send to younger viewers!!  As far as being amusing, I chuckled once and spent the remainder of the film looking at my watch.",1366243200,,422,4.291139240506329

He actually managed to bring back the cute humor of those days, but without the crassness. Maybe it helps that he wasn't in charge of this movie, simply providing the voice. It's heartwarming, humorous, and genuinely enjoyable to watch with your kids.",1365811200,,375,4.7846153846153845
5749767,2,B00CWZUOV6,"I rented Hotel Transylvania based on the sheer number of glowing reviews and ended up remembering the painful truth that not all that glitters is gold. Sometimes, it is nuclear waste.

I can't recommend this one - good taste forbids it. My range of young children laughed maybe four times through the whole movie. I've been teaching them to be discriminating in their choices of entertainment, but I didn't realize how well they had learned the lesson. Good kids! I'll be increasing your allowance.

The sublime The Incredibles had more laughs in its first five minutes than this did at 90 (felt like 900!) minutes long. The story line? Predictable - daddy doesn't ""understand"" his angst-ridden teen's angst, but eventually comes around and is now cool for capitulating. The characters? Bombastically uninteresting. Most of them are loud ""one-liner"" factories, belching out ear and eye pollution without remorse. And of course, the movie slouches to its close with a terribly trite ""everybody dance now"" scene. Madagascar's done that bit to shreds, I believe, as have other second-and-third-tier animated films.

I'm done seething that 90 minutes of my time went to subsidizing Hollywood mediocrity. Thank you, and hope this helps.",1365724800,4,1231,5.207070707070707

5749844,4,B00CWZUOV6,"From Genndy Tartakovsky, director of ""Samurai Jack"" and ""Dexter's Laboratory"" comes the Sony Pictures Animation/Sony Pictures Imageworks animated film ""Hotel Transylvania"".

Featuring a screenplay by Peter Baynham (""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", ""Bruno"", ""Arthur Christmas"") and Robert Smigel (""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"", ""You Don't Mess with Zohan"", ""Saturday Night Live""), the film was released in theaters in Sept. 2012 and with a budget set at $85 million, ""Hotel Transylvania"" would go on to make over $321 million in the box office.

The animated film would feature an all-star cast providing their voices.  Featured in the film are Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, CeeLo Green, Jon Lovitz and  Chris Parnell.  The film was produced by Michelle Murdocca and executive produced by Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel.

""Hotel Transylvania"" is an animated comedy about Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), who is the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, a five-star resort for fellow monsters, to keep them safe from human civilization.

On a special day to celebrate his daughter Mavis' (voiced by Selena Gomez) 118th birthday, Dracula invites his friends Frankenstein (voiced by Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (voiced by Fran Drescher), Murray the Mummy (voiced by Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (voiced by Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), Griffin the Invisble Man (voiced by David Spade), Bigfoot, Steve the Blob and other monsters.

But for Mavis, what she wants for her birthday, now that she is grown up, is to explore the outside world and see the human world.

But being a single father and also a strict father to Mavis, Dracula doesn't want her to because he believes the humans want the monsters dead.

But Dracula comes up with a plan, to let her wander out for her first time to a nearby village, but what Mavis doesn't know is that the inhabitants are also monsters and part of Dracula's plan to have his daughters stay home.  And he succeeds.

But when a human named Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg), who is exploring the nearby forest, follows staff to Hotel Transylvania, Dracula tries to hide him from other monsters, worrying that a human might set off chaos as the monsters may think the humans are there to kill them.  So, Dracula disguises Jonathan as a Flesh Golem named Johnny-stein and has Frankenstein thinking that Johnny-stein is a relative.

And with Jonathan's presence in Hotel Transylvania, Jonathan is able to liven up the festivity by introducing them to modern rock and dance music and how to have fun and eventually charming everyone including Dracula's daughter, Mavis.

Seeing that both Mavis and Jonathan are getting close, Dracula tells Jonathan to please stay away from his daughter.  And when Jonathan wants to know why, Dracula reveals a tragic past of why Mavis' mother is no longer living and how that tragedy ties to humans.

Not wanting to hurt Dracula, Jonathan is willing to do what Dracula says and distance himself from Mavis, despite her falling in love with him.  But when Chef Quasimodo (voiced by Jon Lovitz) finds out that there is a human in Hotel Transylvania, he wants to cook him up.  And with Jonathan captured, can Dracula save him from harm, but also keep his human existence hidden from the monsters at the hotel?

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Hotel Transylvania"" is a fun animated film that is a fun treat for an animated film.  For children, the usually creepy characters such as Frankenstein, the Mummy, the Werewolf, etc. are presented in a non-threatening manner.  If anything, the film tries to show Dracula and the monsters as fearful of humans and are trying to protect their kind from being killed by humans.  In fact, Dracula doesn't even suck human blood and if anything, the monsters are portrayed more as a non-threatening endangered species who just want to be left alone.

And part of the storyline revolves around a controlling and fearful father, Dracula, who cares deeply for his daughter Mavis.  But as Mavis is old enough to explore the world on her own and wants to get out and see it, it's about one father trying his best not to lose his daughter but also a fear that by exploring the world outside Hotel Transylvania, she may meet the same fate as Dracula's wife, who was killed by humans.

But life changes for Mavis when she comes across a guy named Jonathan, who happens to be a human.

""Hotel Transylvania"" doesn't try to become an animated film that tries to tug on emotional sympathy.  The characters are eccentric, while rated-PG, the characters were made to be more upbeat and naive.  And parents, while rated PG, most of the film is not threatening.  Possible scenes that children may get scared at is Dracula turning into a vampire bat, pretend zombies being  accidentally burned by flames but there is no death but the story of Dracula discussing his wife's tragedy.

Character animation is pleasing and for the most part, this film is upbeat, fun and just an entertaining film that is meant to entertain children.  No deep or complex story, no emotional storyline, just a straight-up story about a human who accidentally wanders into Hotel Transylvania and Dracula trying to find a way to keep him concealed from his guests and also prevent him getting close to his only daughter.

Voice acting for the most part is done well by its cast of big names such as Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, David Spade, Fran Derescher, CeeLo Green, Chris Parnell to name a few.

As for the DVD, the Blu-ray release actually is better in terms of picture quality, lossless audio soundtrack and more special features.  The DVD does look good but doesn't come with all the special features as its Blu-ray counterpart.

Overall, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a good film that features a lot of entertaining and fun moments.  It's a bit silly but children will love the fart jokes, the humor and the pleasing animation.  Parents shouldn't worry too much and there is no major violence or anything too scary but for those the scenes I mentioned earlier, parental guidance is suggested.

A fun family film for the entire family, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a beautifully animated film from Sony Pictures Animation and Sony Pictures Imageworks, that will make children laugh from beginning to end!

An entertaining animated film worth checking out!",1364601600,,8868,4.985034013605442

5749862,4,B00CWZUOV6,"This past Halloween was pretty exciting as far as animated features goes: Frankenweenie, Paranorman, Hotel Transylvania- if a trip to my local Cineplex didn't cost roughly the same as the Gross National Product of Latvia; I imagine there could have been some seriously great memories made with a tub of popcorn and a warm hoodie.  But alas, I digress.  In my case, Hotel Transylvania had to wait for the home release and for the most part, it was quite enjoyable if entirely inappropriate seasonally.

Hotel Transylvania is the $85-million dollar, 91-minute PG rated animated film rumored to have been in development for an abnormally long (even for an animated feature) six-years. The end result lavishly uses the CG medium to reflect the direction and style of animator/director Genndy Tartakovsky.  If that means nothing to you, imagine a slightly caricaturized version of the classic movie monsters complete with clichs and accents a plenty.

While Sony's Image Works division rarely threatens Pixar or DreamWork's supremacy in the computer animated realm, the visuals are solid here with a good deal of background detail present that almost demands multiple viewings so fully absorb.

The story, while certainly adequate, sadly never reaches much deeper than the previews alluded: In 1895, Count Dracula builds a resort in Transylvania, hidden away from the humanity, as a place for monsters to crash but also as a sanctuary to raise his daughter Mavis.

Fast forward to present day and old Drac is busy inviting friends (among these Frankenstein and his wife Eunice; Wayne and Wanda werewolves; Griffin, the invisible man; Murray, the mummy; Bigfoot, among others) to the hotel so as to celebrate the 118th birthday of Mavis (18 in human years).

Just as the party is about to get underway, a dopey 21-year-old human named Jonathan happens to stumble upon the hotel.  Monsters, it turns out, fear humans the way, well, the way humans fear monsters.  Ordinarily the Count would likely kick a wandering human to the curb (possibly short on a few corpuscles) but complicating matters is Mavis, who falls in love with the lad quite unaware that he is in fact a human.

Undoubtedly the film's greatest strength lies in its casting: Adam Sandler as Dracula, Andy Samberg as Jonathan, Kevin James as Frankenstein, David Spade as the Invisible Man, Steve Buscemi as Wolfman and on and on.  One really gets the feeling that these guys could be reading random pages from a phonebook and elicit the giggles.  That said, everyone plays really well off each other but never reach the type of comedic crescendo I sort of expected going in.  Most of the humor is actually derived from visual gags (Frankenstein's lower half releases some gas that gets blames on the unsuspecting Mummy, a female skeleton gets caught showering and tries to cover up despite having no physical features to hide and so on).

Mark Mothersbaugh's upbeat score is quite appropriate; reminding the viewer in even the darkest moments of the piece that the focal point here is laughter and silliness with love as the backdrop.  The ending of the film does break out into a cheesy musical number that some may find a bit much but in all the audio is right up there with the visuals in terms of propelling the prose along.

In all Hotel Transylvania is a success on most every level.  It lacks that Pixar creativity factor that continually results in the studio's showering in awards but it's solid through and through with visual charm that will keep the young ones entertained and enough layered wit for adults to enjoy as well.",1364428800,,3593,4.940199335548173

5749940,4,B00CWZUOV6,"I gauge a  good animated movie based on my son's attention span. He was playing with his toys in 15 minutes. This movie is typical ""Adam Sandler trying too hard"". The story is slow. The characters are forgettable. The singing is quite honestly...lame. But, the animation is beautiful, and some of the jokes were funny. I found myself looking for chores to do mid-movie. So a yawner...but there's worse movies than this.",1363478400,,419,4.819444444444445
5749941,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I played high school football with the director, Genndy Tartakovsky, in Chicago so I guess my review might be considered a little biased because I have supported him since he was an unknown. My kids and I really did enjoy the movie and have enjoyed his earlier creations like Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, and the animated Star Wars Clone Wars for years and were pleasantly surprised by Hotel Transylvania. It is a great family film that will become a staple around Halloween for years to come. It is a touching coming of age story that is sweet and fun. Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez do a great job, as do the rest of the voice actors. Kudos to my old teammate on this great movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as my family did.",1363392000,,737,4.386861313868613
5749942,5,B00CWZUOV6,Really great for the whole family.  Kids and adults will find many moments to laugh and relate to plus it stands up to multi viewings!,1363392000,,134,4.36
5749943,4,B00CWZUOV6,"In a bit of a swerve, it is the monsters who fear the humans, fear their mob mentality and the pitchforks and the torches. Hidden from the human world, Hotel Transylvania stands as the last sanctuary for monsters. It is haven from human persecution. Its proprietor, Count Dracula, boasts that his hotel has been human-free since 1898. At that moment, all the monster kids in the theater watching the film probably felt a twinge of unease. Duhn-DUHN!-duhn.

Dracula has a daughter of whom he is overprotective. To celebrate his daughter Mavis's 118th birthday, he throws a bash and invites all the horror staples from Universal Studios. Drac is one of those party hosts you just want to smack upside the head, what with his rigidly structured planning and the epic lameness of his party activities. On a more personal note, he persists in denying Mavis (Selena Gomez) her freedom. She's so curious about the humans. She longs to travel the world and experience exotic cultures and mingle with different folks. He keeps warning her of how so very dangerous humans are. Who knows how long things would have remained at status quo? But then Hotel Transylvania gets an unexpected guest. A young American backpacker. A fun-loving human. Monsters, hide your daughters.

3.5 out of 5 stars. It seems odd to be praising Adam Sandler for turning in a (relatively) restrained performance when that performance happens to be in his role of Count Dracula. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA certainly is an enjoyable enough picture. It presents sharp and stylized animation, thanks to Genndy Tartakovsky's vision. Tartakovsky, if you recall, is the mastermind behind fun 'toons like DEXTER'S LABORATORY, POWERPUFF GIRLS, SAMURAI JACK, and the hand-drawn Star Wars microseries, CLONE WARS (not the CGI version). I do recommend HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA but with a reservation or three.

Them kids will love it, love the frenetic pace and the Looney Tunes vibe and the sometimes potty humor. I enjoy those as well, but I can't help it if I occasionally want something more than what's tailored for kid-oriented sensibilities. I can't help but wonder what Pixar - a studio that seamlessly balances fantastic humor and heartfelt storytelling - would've done with this. The storyline unfolds in by-the-numbers fashion. It invests so much in overcaffeinated sight gags that it sacrifices all genuine emotions. To me, those father-daughter moments between Drac and Mavis that were meant to be moving come off as so much lip service. It doesn't help that the human (Adam Sandberg) is this doltish drifter with mortifying hygiene. As a homebody and a regular bather, I am unable to identify with him. I don't even like backpacks.

Despite all that, there's stuff to like. The film exudes such a good-natured vibe. If you like the zany, the gags do come a mile a minute, with enough of 'em hits to compensate for the misses. One of my favorites is a gag involving the Invisible Man playing Charades. I love the character designs. I like Sandler's laid-back take on Dracula, even if, somewhere, Bela Lugosi is rolling in his grave (although this probably just means the sun's almost set). Most of all, as a fan of those old-timey, black-and-white Universal creature features, I appreciate the homage intended by Tartakovsky, Sandler, and company. And I like the conceit of Count Dracula's trying his hand at entrepreneurship. I guess it's just one more way for him to bleed people dry.

Pros: The animation was high quality and fun to look at, the colors were vibrant, some fun cameos from voice actors. I enjoyed some of the jokes, most of which were in the previews.

Cons: The story was really predictable from the first ten minutes with no surprises at all except how very long the vampires could be in direct sunshine without, you know, dying. It tried too hard to be emotionally compelling without enough humor to make that unsuccessful attempt bearable.

The story is a good one about accepting those who are different - in this case ""monsters"" accepting a human.  It shows how we all have preconcieved notions whether obtained through what we've been taught or through past experiences. However, those notions can be wrong and we need to be open minded. It's a story about a father's love for his daughter and his desire to protect her especially when she wants to see the outside world and falls in love with a human.

What I thought would be a cute, funny, and entertaining filled animation/movie became somewhat of a big old bore. At first I was so excited... I couldn't wait to get home and watch it. So I inserted Hotel Transylvania into my DVD player and waited in anticipation for the laughter and enjoyment to begin. I guess it was about twenty minutes into the, when I found myself, becoming bored. I began to move about the room do this or that. And ended up on my computer playing games online; and the next thing I know the movie is over. (Told you, I'm not good at reviewing as this is my first time)....But after I realized what had happened, I was very disappointed.  This movie just didn't interest me. And if a movie doesn't catch my attention in at least the first 10-20 minutes then to me it's not worth watching. But hey I'm just one person with one opinion. I do however, think it would attract a younger crowd. Say 5-10 year old's. But as for me I it's a big thumbs down!",1363046400,,1038,4.295918367346939

The comedy is clean and quite funny with its references to lore, trends and music.  The characterizations and voice talent is excellent and well-cast.  The story of being sheltered, dealing with stereotypes and xenophobia rings well for today.  At the center of the story is Dracula and his 'teenage(?)' daughter voiced by Selena Gomez) who wants to go out and see the world.  Dracula (wonderfully voiced by Adam Sandler) who wants to protect her from the bad humans and does not want her hurt.  She, of course rebels and is helped by a wacky human who is at first oblivious to where he is (Hotel Transylvania - a vacation spot for monsters).  Trouble erupts but in the end, old Dracula realizes he cannot shield his daughter just teach her what is right and to be careful.

5750005,4,B00CWZUOV6,"We finally had a chance to watch this movie, which the boys had been talking about since seeing the adverts back at Halloween. Short version is that it's great fun.

The story is pretty simplistic. You have an over-protective father (who just happens to be Dracula) and a human who wanders into a hotel for monsters (all of whom are more scared of him than he is of them). Don't expect too much in the way of Pixar sophistication or pathos either. This is more about fart jokes.

And you know what, that's fine. Because this is aimed unashamedly at kids. And it gives them things to laugh at.  Adam Sandler and his usual band of cohorts provide solid vocal work throughout but the star of the show is the animation.

The movie was directed by Genndy Tartakovsky who is probably best known for his traditional hand drawn 2D animation for the likes of Dexter's Laborator or Samurai Jack. Here he fully embraces what 3D computer animation can offer, without feeling obliged to mimic real life.

That's what gives this film energy and propels to above average status in my mind.",1362787200,2,1074,4.602094240837697
5750006,5,B00CWZUOV6,"A light-hearted (mostly), fun romp through monster movie memes and films.

The characterization of Dracula doesn't fit with more traditional depictions (this version is basically just an overly-protective father figure, albeit with the powers of a vampire giving him somewhat more threat to back him up).

However, while Sandler gives an effective performance, it's the other characters in the movie that really give this movie its heart; Dracula is just a bit too over-the-top to be taken too seriously.

A fun watch, though.",1362787200,,526,5.313253012048193
5750007,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Sandler's cast with many of his buddies from prior films which makes this a good watch for anyone. With these voices, including Kevin James, David Spade, Andy Samburg, Molly Shannon and Cee Lo Green as the Mummy, it's full of laughs.",1362787200,,233,4.7073170731707314

If you saw Despicable Me (which I believe was made by the same folks), it had even more heart and love, yet with sort of an Addams family zaniness. Very fast paced. Lots of fun references to old monster movies. I didn't even mind Sandler's weird accent. I don't have kids, but I think kids would like it for other reasons.",1362528000,,430,4.130952380952381

The concept of a monster spa, where they could rest, free from the 'terror' of humanity is a cool idea. Unfortunately, the characterizations and 'script' (?) quickly degenerated into a faux hip-hop 'tude, creaky old sitcom gags, Adam Sandler cliches (burps, farts, etc.) and enough treacle and bathos to send the audience into sugar-shock.

Not the worst animated movie out there...but, certainly much closer to 'Scooby-Doo' than 'Nightmare Before Christmas'.",1362441600,,680,5.0625

I would seriously reconsider any new kids movies after the last 10 times I've seen this movie with different names. How about a kids movie where the kids actually learn something about when they're being stupid?  The way kids are today, I'd say they can benefit from that much more.",1362268800,,460,4.810126582278481

Just ok.",1362268800,,164,4.125

5750082,3,B00CWZUOV6,"I gave HT three stars because the kids liked it. To me it was Tangled/Finding Nemo all mixed up. With that said it feels like I have seen it before. The dialogue is so full of fast paced puns and jokes that the actual story takes forever to develop. The colors and setting are great, but the ""acting"" and story were lacking for me to like. If you want to buy this move I would wait until it goes down in price.",1362182400,,410,4.012195121951219

The 3d previews play but when it was time for the feature film - it would not load.  This has happened twice with the same movie so I am in the process of sending the second one back.

5750112,4,B00CWZUOV6,"This grandma enjoyed watching it with her 6-year old granddaughter. We saw it in the theater and she asked to see it again at home. She was introduced to new monsters and I got to see old friends (Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman, Invisible Man) depicted in a new and fun way. Nice to see that monsters have the same concerns as real folk. Voice actors were chosen well (Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi), they fit their characters so I didn't dwell on who the voices were but who they depicted. Cute with a nice mix of both child and adult humor without being offensive. Nothing too scary for youngsters, a teen appeal and grown-ups will smile. Moved fast, had a heart and of course, a happy ending.",1361923200,,707,4.574803149606299

 special. I think this movie is perfect for
 a nice, joyful family. kids will like it. My
 favorite part is when it's Mavis's 118th
 birthday. It starts like this, a little vampire
 baby girl is born,(thats Mavis)in a small
 house. But then Mavis's vampire mom
dies, because of humans. Then Mavis's
 dad takes Mavis to another house where
 Mavis grows up.
 Then Mavis's dad builds a hotel. That's why
 the movie's name is Hotel Transylvania. My
 favorite character  is Mavis.this is a
 laugh-out-loud kind of  movie. You should watch Hotel Transylvania some time.",1361923200,,605,4.803921568627451

My 2 year old son loved the visuals and the slap stick.  My 10 year old loved the evil humor in it.  I thought it was a nice father/daughter film with some predictable plot but still had some great moments that made the movie entertaining to watch.

I watched it with my little daughter and she adored it- even though her father is built more like Frankenstein than the slender Dracula.

5750146,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I finally got a chance to see this movie after seeing all the commercials for it. I figured though that the commercials held the best parts of the movie and I would not be impressed. If I could be any more wrong it would be impossible! Wow what a great movie! It is an absolutely hilarious Monster parody comedy all in one. Monsters afraid of Humans and Humans worshiping the monsters!

The story is about Count Dracula holding up to his promise to protect his diseased wife and his daughter, Mavis. Count Dracula is deathly afraid of Humans and I will not spoil the why he is, but he is protecting Mavis from ever seeing them. He built a castle to keep her safe. Every year he invites all the monsters to his safe haven to celebrate Mavis's birthday. In the movie it is Mavis's (Selena Gomez's voice) 118th birthday, and she is ready to go out into the world and see things.

After twists and turns and the Count trying to protect Mavis too much, Mavis finally meets a backpacking boy named Jonathan. Jonathan and her ""Zing"", and the rest I will leave up to the movie telling you what happens. It truly is a very funny and interesting movie.

The comedy in this movie is very good not only for children, but adults too. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good this movie is. It was one of the better animated movies I have seen in the past few months, and I will be watching it again.

Overall I would highly recommend seeing this movie!",1361750400,4,1446,4.364312267657993

If you think the highest achievement young women should aspire to is marriage, that you only get one chance in your life at true love, that incredibly controlling and deceitful fathers ultimately mean well and have the best interests of their children in mind - along with a host of other pseudo-traditional rubbish, you may enjoy this film. I watched it with another adult and we couldn't believe the shallowness of the paternal value-system this film portrayed. I'm not interested in hearing ""it's just a kids movie"" from people unconcerned about the potential influence of cinema on child development. That makes it all the worse. Hosts of youth-oriented films are released every year that make some effort to respect the youth they are primarily directed at. This film's ""messages"" were ridiculous and insulting to today's aspiring young women. Even the most jaded parent can't possibly believe teaching a young adolescent they will only have one shot at true love is a good thing. I knew a middle schooler (many years ago) who killed himself, at least in part, because he apparently believed that very thing when his young love relationship went to pieces. The teen oriented, female character in this film apparently has no ambition beyond living under her father's controlling cape until she can one day venture out and get married. Heaven forbid she go to monster school and grow up to practice law. The other, more promising theme of the storyline, vaguely alluding to reconciliation between different groups and shelving longstanding prejudices, plays second fiddle to the daughter's storyline - and frankly becomes largely lost in the frenetic visuals of the film and endless stream of (almost entirely unfunny) attempts at on-screen humor. Come on - they included nearly the entire Universal monsters pantheon. . .and this was the best they could do?

The vacant storyline aside, visually the film looks great. The 3D version has some nice effects. The voices are done reasonably well. A couple of scenes went on - in my opinion - a little too long and watching it started to feel like a chore after a while, but the effects kept it marginally engaging. That said, there are much better options available for family entertainment. *1/2",1361491200,,2313,5.0365535248041775

5750203,1,B00CWZUOV6,"I bought this movie sight-unseen because of positive reviews and because I was craving another worthwhile 3D movie.  I'm normally fairly forgiving of animated features but I can't stand this one.

The writers were apparently obsessed with bodily functions and were much more concerned with them than with actual witty and/or reasonably believable dialogue.

I'm not someone who hates all things Adam Sandler either.  I enjoy Happy Gilmore and 50 First Dates is a very good movie.  But if you can't stand his ridiculous voices, this movie is downright painful.

The ""comedic"" situations in the movie are worse than contrived, the ""humor"" almost always lands flat, the ""sweet""/""emotional"" moments were completely un-earned and insincere, the ""lesson"" is downright wrong for the young viewers it was apparently intended for, and the ending is protracted and annoying.  Also, although the movie clearly maintains the tradition that sunlight burns vampires, it requires the audience to accept that a vampire can spend the entirety of a lengthy pursuit and equally lengthy conversation in broad daylight under clear skies without suffering serious harm, amongst other ideas that strain against the viewer's intellect.

Visually, the movie isn't too terrible. The animation is lively but I found it far too exaggerated for my taste. The music (other than the awful musical numbers) is not especially memorable but it's not offensive (unlike the aforementioned musical numbers). The voice acting is terrible, although I'm not sure what they could have done with a script as bad as this one.

In short, this is one of the three worst movies it's ever been my misfortune to own. I've watched it twice, each time with different people.  Each time, the movie wore out its welcome with anyone watching in the first 15 minutes and only got worse from there.

There are clearly a lot of people who liked this movie and I don't doubt that many children are likely to enjoy it.  I really wanted to like it and I gave it a second try but it was actually worse the second time through.

Unless someone you know, who knows your tastes well, recomemends this movie to you, I'd recommend avoiding this movie.",1361232000,20,2186,5.005524861878453

We liked it enough to purchase the 3D Blu-ray to watch it at home.  It has been viewed several times since Christmas.  The kids love the characters and the story.  The 3D is neat but we enjoy it just as much in 2D because we like the story, the characters, and the humor.  I actually like it more now that I have seen it about 3 times.  Someone who panned this movie said it was written for the lowest common denominator.  As a card carrying member of Mensa, I assure you it appeals to high IQ people as well as everyone else.  I wouldn't encourage super young kids to watch this - then again some little kids like scary movies.  If your kids are OK with Monsters, Inc. they should be ok with this.

My children and I enjoyed it and I wouldn't mind seeing it over and over again being that it is not filled with the sappy songs from other children's movies. I can relate to it having grown up with a very overprotective albeit loving father, and I can understand from a parents point of view of only wanting your children to be safe. Kids are going to grow and you got to let them live. This movie is for children of all ages who love to laugh!",1360972800,,610,4.359649122807017

All of the humor is clean, and as long as you aren't concerned with your kids being entertained by cartoony monsters (including all of the classics, like vampires, mummies, zombies, werewolves, Frankenstein, gremlins, skeletons, etc), this one is family friendly.

5750260,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I have to say when it come to computer generated animated films I was relieved that 2012 Hotel Transylvania could follow up a disaster like 2011 Rango movie and I found this even more entertaining than 2010 Mega Mind. The idea of a group of classic monsters getting together for a party in a hotel like castle reminded me  a little bit of the classic stop motion animated Halloween special from my childhood called Mad Monster Party. The monsters in this was far funnier and had a better storyline.

After the lost of his wife Dracula built his hotel so that monsters and especially his daughter Mavis could be safe from the bigoted evils of humans. Now its Marvis' 118 birthday and she's ready to meet the outside world head on. What she didn't expect was for the outside world to come to her.  Enter the human party animal John who is always ready for a good time and bring surprises and excitment to Dracula's typically borning birthday party concepts as they fall more and more in love with one another. The catch though is that Dracula worried about what his guests might think of a human showing up in his hidden monster oasis has disguise John as a mini Frankenstein monster.

Like some dads too, who won't let their daughters date until they are 30, this one isn't up to her dating until at least 118, or probably older. Only problem is, for her birthday, she meets the enemy, and dad only wants to get rid of him, which he does. But shes unhappy, and he cant stand to see her miserable, so he gets him to come back. Family friendly (some children will really love the monster antics), and theres a lesson in how to let go of your children in there somewhere! Really liked itgood feelings!

Adam Sandler does an impressive job as do the rest of the cast of voices! The story combines classic horror tale (note: nothing terrifying in the movie) with modern theme, i.e., daughter wants to explore the outside world.
Great plot and good finish.

Ultraviolet is NOT so good. Not compatible with Apple iOS devices unless you install another ""App.""
""Digital Copy"" should just support downloading into your iTunes account like other Digital Copy films do. I realize this is due to ""Sony"" not wanting to compete with Apple, but I will NOT purchase any more Blu-Rays that don't support Digital Copy on iOS devices. Will just purchase the film through iTunes store and will be able to watch on Apple TV and iOS devices.

I took back the Blu-Ray (yes some retailers can be convinced to take returns) and purchased this film from iTunes for much less than the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy.

I would like to remove a star for Sony's handling of digital content, but decided not to because the film is excellent.

It was good, certainly worth watching, and I'm sure any child 10 and under with thoroughly enjoy it.

5750362,2,B00CWZUOV6,"This movie isn't worth the ten lines I have to write about it. All style, no substance; with a crap pile of exclusionary male bonding where any female that isn't young, thin, or ""passably hot"" is silenced put to work up-keeping the hotel while the male monsters can go about their petty dramas undisturbed.

If you think kids don't pick up on these messages in movies, think again.

If you go around claiming to be progressive and against discrimination, but ignore all the offensive crap in this movie and give it 10 stars regardless; you're lying to yourself and everyone else.

It is the year 2012, and movies in America are still selling sexist stereotypes to the public. The only reason people go to the movies is to celebrate sexism as if it's cool and awesome, but I thought that was limited to stupid adult films. I just wasn't prepared to see that stuff SOLD TO OUR KIDS via cartoon movies.",1360454400,,899,4.571428571428571

5750374,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I first heard of this movie a looooong time ago in an issue of Fangoria. It always found its way into the upcoming section but nothing wad ever said about it. This went on for yeats and I had no idea it was an animated film.
Anyway, enough of that. Animated movies these days try too hard in all of the wrong areas. Many seem to throw in long sections of drama and can leave the audience in tears. When you sit down as a family to watch a movie with your kids, do you really want them crying during the cartoon because the filmmakers decided to throw in too many tear-jerk moments? No. They're supposed to be a fun movie that brings laughable moments aplenty that can be enjoyed by everyone. Hotel Transylvania is exactly what it looks like. A cute family movie that has a great story and cast with loads and loads of laughs that can be enjoyed by all. I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this one. Its fun, its cute and I will say its one of the best animated films to come along in many years!

Perfect viewing for you and your little monsters.

5750379,3,B00CWZUOV6,"Hotel Transylvania(released Sept/12)is yet another animated flick(gosh the explosion in animation these past few years!)starring the voice talents of,among others,Adam Sandler as Dracula,Andy Samberg as Jonathan/Johnny/Johnnystein,Selena Gomez as Mavis,Kevin James as Frankenstein/Frank,Fran Drescher as Eunice,Steve Buscemi as Wayne,Molly Shannon as Wanda,David Spade as Griffin the Invisible Man,Cee Lo Green as Murray,and Jon Lovitz as Quasimodo. It's an airing out,in large part for the kiddies,of the Universal monsters,all""dressed"" up(animatedly)to look cutesy. However while the jokes and animation come fast and furious,overal it is just not that funny and the plot gets tiring much too quickly.
The Hotel Transylvania is just that,a hotel now run by Count Dracula. He opened it as a get away for monsters of all kinds,from the humans who stalk them in the outside world. He is very protective of his daughter Mavis who is coming of age,and he is super anal of his staff and hotel. His daughter,who can turn into a bat like her father,wants to make her first trip to the outside world as promised,on her 118th birthday coming up. He allows her to go but,unknown to her,he has made an artificial town,brought zombies to life as the townsfolks,and told them to be""aggressive""towards her when she arrives. The plan works and she returns home disappointed.
Into Dracs world comes a young teen who is backpacking through the area and stumbles onto Dracs hotel. Drac tries to hide him from the rest of the patrons(and it's a full house of monsters)because they'd be horrified to have the very thing they are trying to get away from,be there as a guest. Eventually Drac must come up with a nom de plum for him,so he dresses him up and calls him Johnny Stein. He poses as Frankies long lost cousin,and Frankie buys it. Johnny starts ingratiating himself to all the patrons who really come to like him,especially Dracs daughter. Through alot of near misses and faux pauxs,Johnny's real identity is always justhisclose to being found out. And Drac is constantly beside himself with trying to run his motel and/or trying to either get rid of,or hide,Johnny.
The chef of the hotel,Quasimodo,along with his buddy the Fly,come to suspect the truth and try to tell the patrons the turth about Johnny,but is stopped by Drac. However something happens during all this frenticism of Dracs. He actually comes to like him. In the end his misguided ""duty""to his patrons and his over protectiveness towards Mavis,forces him to finally give Johnny the kiss off. Johnny,under duress,deliberately spurns Mavis'advances and affections,and he boards a jet back home. Mavis is in the doldrums and without Johnny there the entire hotel is in a funk. Drac sees nothing to do but to get Johnny back. He flies in daylight,continually smoldering,risking his life to get Johnny's attention on the plane. He finally does and he manipulates the plane to fly back to the airport,much to the chagrin of the passengers. The film ends as Johnny and Mavis tie the knot and start their life together,with Drac's,and the entire patrons of the hotel's,blessings.
The film is a kind of mixed bag throughout. Just as the jokes and plot seem to get going,the plot will either slow and/or the jokes start getting old and fall flat. There are some cute moments such as the time Drac and Mavis have a heart to heart,and Mavis,as a bat,starts pouting. It's an adorable look. It also has some neat touches such as scream cheese. But these little bon mots just aren't enough to save this film. As a result,I found it,unfortunately,a bit of a drag. Now the kids,that MAY be a different story. They may like it to a certain extent,but I kind of think even they would be squirming in their seats through parts of this film. This film to me is kind of another another Arthur(see my review on that),but just a cut above even that.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/w a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,some musical vids and a featurette.
All in all not as good as I thought it might or should be. The jokes are old and the cutesy factor,as good as it was(obviously geared for the kids),could not overcome the film's basic handicap;that of an uneven storyline and the stop and go nature it created. I fall in the middle on this one;almost enough to fall below the 3 star line(but not quite),but way below a 4 star rating.",1360281600,,4407,4.924731182795699

5750402,3,B00CWZUOV6,"I have to be honest - there is nothing seriously flawed with this movie at all, it is just  that I  didn't think it was that great.

The plot is pretty simple( as it often the case in animated family movies).

In this case, Count Dracula doesn't want his baby girl- MAVIS- who is finally turning 118 yrs old( no typo there)- to grow up and go out in the world.

The world is an unfriendly place, especially to monsters like them.  Dracula is a doting dad ever fearful of losing his girl.

He has already lost too much in his life and he dreads the idea of her desire to spread her little bat wings and fly out, on her own.

What is nice is that while this is an animated movie- it touches on a theme all loving parents can relate to.

NO PARENT WHO ADORES THEIR KID(S) REALLY WANTS THEM TO LEAVE  HOME FOR GOOD AND CERTAINLY, THEY FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY IN THAT BIG, WIDE WORLD OUT THERE.

The computer graphics are very well done and Adam Sandler is almost unrecognizable as the voice of Count Dracula, except  for those moments while watching, when you suddenly remember he is playing Dracula. :-)

 He did a good job of disappearing right into the role.

( You will be surprised by the many stars who played various monster voices for this movie).

I did find a lot of the action sequences a bit dizzying and I am all for action in regular movies, but in an animated film, it all felt a bit overwhelming visually.

Almost like your eyes can't follow the action fast enough.

 The entire movie roughly covers Mavis' big birthday bash.

The one her father has planned for her 118th birthday.

He has gone through great lengths to make it special, all the while trying to hide his great fear of her desire to go out and explore the world.  He knows she is going to undoubtedly bring this desire up to him, now that she is 118.

All starts out smoothly for the party, until an unsuspecting interloper some how gets into the Hotel Transylvania- a Hotel dedicated  to being a safe and peaceful haven strictly for vacationing monsters of all sorts.

Having an intruder show up, is where the story takes a wild turn and the action gets really crazy.

Loved the ending sequence of the movie- the music was great if you are of the right age to enjoy it. May  not be everyone's bag, but for those who found their foot taping or their leg bouncing, you might want to check the film's soundtrack info on AMAZON.

I know there was a lot of praise for this movie, so maybe my expectations were just a bit too high.  Or maybe others will agree with me.  It was OKAY- but not anything great.

Again, I will say the graphics are terrific, but in an era where animated films no longer being drawn ala*  old Disney style*, there are better animated movies out there to check out.

If this movie's monster theme is something that really appeals to you( and any kids you may have), then perhaps you will like this better than the typical viewer.",1360195200,,2925,4.327808471454881

Some movies may only have parts that are funny but I cannot recall even one in this film. The closest is the depantsing of the invisible man but it doesnt even get a smile...just a small grimace. Save your money and don't spend even one cent on this disaster.

They all gather for the 118th birthday of the vampire's daughter.  Somehow a backpacking slacker finds his way to the hotel and falls in love with the vampire's daughter.  It's quite funny seeing the vampire trying to  keep the boy's real identity a secret from the monsters. There are really catchy songs and good dialogue.

5750510,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I must say, for those of you who watch Hotel Transylvania, there are SO many different aspects of this movie that make this movie as wonderful as it is. The animation is wonderful. The cinematography is exquisite. The voices for the characters are flawless. Everything about this movie is great!

Not only is this movie great for kids, but is also great for every type of individual.

1. This movie depicts a form of Love, that shows and teaches kids and others that Love does come from the heart, and when you know it, you just do.

2. Shows the struggle of relationships, that they can get tangled and twisted, but never broken, even when a loved on has moved on Life, they will always be there to help guide you.. you just have to open up your eyes and accept it, even if it was something you were hiding from and trying to prevent.

3. Shows parents that kids do fall, stumble, in life, such is Life, but when they find someone else they can trust and love, than that should be something to admire and appreciate and have the child learn many things from.

4. Life is amazing! This journey we call Life really is spectacularly complex and different, so there will never be an instruction manual (even though sometimes I wish there were when I have had to make life decision) but the whole beauty of life is that it is a beautiful struggle, and with it comes progress and strength, and down the road...

5750519,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Hotel Transylvania was a movie that my family and I got a big kick out of. Adam Sandler was the perfect voice and personality to make Count Dracula come to life. The supporting cast was wonderful and the overall movie was pretty funny. There is some bathroom humor in this movie, so if that offends you or if you don't want your kids watching it, you should be aware before you let them view it. It isn't anything vile, but there are some references to things that not all parents will find appropriate.

What I did like about this movie, was that the story line was strong. The father was trying to protect his daughter and as the movie progresses, aside from the humor and the silliness, the movie actually has a point, which is saying something for an animated movie these days. I loved that all of the original horror characters like the invisible ,an, the hydra and and the werewolves were involved in the story.

All in all, this movie made us laugh a lot. The kids enjoyed it from beginning to end and the animation was great. I'd recommend it.",1359849600,,1051,4.4404145077720205

The streaming was poor so the sound quality was disturbing after a while. I had thought it may have been the computers fault so I went to the main computer in the house and tried it there with the same result. I watched it anyway so what could have been a pleasant distraction became something much less. The last 10 minutes the sound and picture were perfect so i know it was something that could have been done to prevent the aggravation I went through. It could have been 4 stars but Lost a lot due to streaming.,1359849600,,686,4.126865671641791

That can get pretty old quickly with some of their choices.  I've now seen Hotel Transylvania five times (yeah, I know) and honestly I'm still enjoying it.  There are plenty of cute moments and catchy songs, and the main conflict is something that any parent can empathize with - a child growing up and wanting to set off on their own adventures.  In this movie, however, the child is turning 118 and her father is Count Dracula.  Just when the Count succeeds in convincing his daughter that the outside world is dangerous and she should remain in his castle/hotel for monsters indefinitely, a 21-year old backpacker stumbles upon the hotel and turns their world upside down.  It has a great ending, and I must say even after five viewings I'm still cracking up in places.  I'd definitely recommend it!",1359763200,,953,4.564705882352941

I have a teenager and one still in elementary school so finding something that isn't painful for the teenager and not over the top for my 8year old can be a challenge. I took away a star because of some lack of respect shown to adults. I know it's suppose to be fun but I'm a parent and though it was funny when I was kid now that I'm on the other side of the joke I don't like it. (sticks out tongue)
I rented this from the ""THE LARGE BRIGHTLY COLORED BOX""{ ;)hint hint} because it was cheaper.",1359676800,,566,4.0625
5750551,2,B00CWZUOV6,"I really wanted to like this (so that I would have another 3D movie in my collection). It started off interesting, but quickly devolved into fart jokes, puerile script tailored to kids, and blah character design. (The design of the teenage boy was awful - he looked like a generic blob for most of the movie (until his hair was restored to normal) - and the Count himself looked pretty blah, too. The bat-daughter was cute, though.)

All that aside, the dialogue was, for the most part, terrible (for adults, anyway). Some animated features, like Shrek and Toy Story, successfully walk the line to make it entertaining for adults as well; this one doesn't succeed. The humor and script are for kids. If this is your main concern, this movie may keep them entertained. Although you will have to explain that humans killed the Count's wife.

There are some funny bits, like the Count's boring party games, or The Fly's translation of Igor.

Some of the action gags are too fast to see. Zip-zip-zip and it's over.

The messages, for what it's worth: 1. Let your kid live their lives however they want. 2. Loud music is more fun. Old music is boring. 3. Today, the world is safer for monsters - we love monsters rather than want to kill them. (Actually kind of touching.)

Overall, it was so disappointing I made sure to return it to Redbox the next day, even though it was raining hard. I don't think it was worth the $1.29 rental. And I'm sure not buying it. But, again, if it entertains your kids, you may find it worthwhile.",1359676800,4,1524,4.547445255474453

My only criticism is that the story line was a little old, a child raised by the father who tries too hard to protect her from the outside world and she rebels (think Finding Nemo).  The comedy aspects of the movie, especially the naive ways of ""Johnnystein"" make up for the overall plot.

5750558,5,B00CWZUOV6,"One hundred years ago Count Dracula lost his beloved wife to the hatred and fear of Mankind. To save his daughter Mavis from suffering a similar fate he commissions a palace to be built. The palace becomes a hidden sanctuary for all the things that go bump in the night.

Fast forward to the present, Dracula's daughter is on the verge of her 118th birthday and she is starting to feel cabin fever. Dracula allows her to explore a nearby Romanian town that turns out to be a ruse meant to scare her against humankind. It works and Mavis abandons her quest to see Paradise Hawaii.

As famous guests (including the Wolfman, his wife and kids, The Mummy, and The Frankenstein Monster) from all over arrive Dracula is pleased to see everything going smoothly...that is until the human world arrives.

Jonathan Van Helsing a 21 year-old backpacker discovers the hidden Castle and thinking that it's a costume party....until he discovers it isn't. To prevent a panic Dracula disguises Jonathan as a monster (a relation of Frankenstein's right arm). A introduces him as a party planner.

As Jonathan becomes the ""death"" of the party Dracula begins to lighten up to the human and Mavis begins to fall for him. But when the Hunchback of Notre dame spills the beans as to Jonathan's true nature he leaves claiming he hates monsters, Mavis included.

When Dracula discovers that Jonathan was Mavis's ""Zing"" (love at first sight) he as long with the Wolfman, Mummy, Frankenstein Monster and Invisible man leave the safety of the Hotel and venture into Transylvania...which is right in the middle of a Celebration of all things monster.

With a large crowd blocking the road and John's plane due to take off the Monster reveals himself in an attempt to scare the crowds away. When the crowd cheers the real monsters, Dracula pleads with the crowd to disperse so he can reunite Mavis n with John.

Using a line of Dracula capes to shield from the light, Drac flits to the runway just in time to see that plane take off. Transforming into a Bat Dracula gives Chase and catches up to the plane. He takes control of the pilots mind and apologizes to Jonathan.

The movie ends with Mavis and Jonathan a couple ready to leave and explore the world.

I was very surprised by this film, the animation was very good as was the acting. However like many others this movie hit upon my pet peeve, of calling the monster Frankenstein. Frankenstein was the name of the Doctor who made it and not the monster itself. Also the Invisible man isn't technically a monster but....whatever.

This film works for both kids and adults and is good to watch especially around Halloween.",1359676800,,2648,4.712121212121212

5750571,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Despite all the goofy antics (which are quite enjoyable), HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is a tale of accepting change and recognizing the importance of individuality.  Count Dracula doesn't want to lose his young daughter Mavis to the outside world--and to humans---and the monsters use the hotel to ensure safety from those ""monstrous"" humans.  Chaos erupts when teenaged human Jonathan winds up as an intruder and falls for Mavis.
The monsters include scores of classic creatures from werewolves to Oz's wicked witch and the Blob.  There are many hilarious vignettes involving these monsters and the film clips along quite nicely when it focuses on these scenes.  HOTEL drags a little when lengthy scenes involving the love story and ""serious"" toned segments slow the pacing.
The voice casting is well done with Steve Buscemi the scene-stealing Wolfman.  There's nothing extraordinary about the animation, but ultimately HOTEL TRANSTLVANIA is delightful fun and appealing to both kids and adults.",1359504000,,987,5.42483660130719

The few attempts at jokes were crass and overdone. With zombies being set afire, body parts falling off, and scenes with a way-too-scary Dracula, this film is also not appropriate for young children. This one is going into the garbage - might as well have just thrown the money in the trash.",1359504000,6,435,4.518987341772152
5750576,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I was fortunate to have the chance to see Bob Clampett speak years ago. Clampett was one of the men responsible for the classic Warner Brothers cartoons and helped create Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and later Beanie and Cecil. One thing he said always stuck with me. He said that during the censorship days of the Hayes Committee, the animators/writers would always sneak in jokes that would pass that adults would get and that children wouldn't understand. This made those cartoons something that adults as well as children could enjoy then. While not every animator these days follows that advice those behind HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA do and the result is a great movie that entertains children AND adults.

One hundred and eighteen years ago Count Dracula built a castle/hotel where monsters would find safe haven from the humans that hunted and tried to destroy them. Each year the monsters all gather to celebrate the birthday of Dracula's daughter Mavis. This year will be different though as Mavis' special gift is one left by her mother who died when she was born, to be opened on this particular birthday. Keep in mind 118 in Dracula years makes her in her late teens.

Mavis longs to leave the castle and roam the world to see what is out there. Inspired by a post card she found in her mother's belongings of Hawaii, she wants to see what her mother saw, to experience something behind the walls she's known all her life. Her father, knowing that humans would rather see her dead, wants her to say home though and will do everything in his power to insure she does so. He even goes so far as to allow her to visit a local village, not telling her something she'll only discover later about that village.

Mavis returns home and all seems to be going well until a stranger shows up. Jonathan is a backpacking teen on vacation roaming the countryside who accidentally stumbles upon the well hidden castle. He enters and finds everything he sees amazing until Dracula finds him. Trying to prevent him from being destroyed by the monsters (who think that all humans want to destroy them), Dracula puts Jonathan in make up and has him pose as a party planner there to help with Mavis birthday bash. When Mavis gets a glimpse of Jonathan, the first person she's ever seen close to her age, they both get a glazed look in their eyes and suffer a case of love at first sight.

But human and vampire have no chance for happiness in the eyes of good old dad, so he tries to keep the two apart. Dracula's parties have long since lost their luster and are boring even to the yearly attendees who include Frankenstein, the Mummy, Wolfman, Invisible Man and more. Jonathan livens this up with his youthful ways much to the chagrin of Dracula. Can the star crossed lovers make a go of it? Or will Dracula make sure that the Jonathan stays safe from the rest of the monsters who actually seem to like him almost better than Dracula?

It's a simple plot to begin with and ends up offering plenty of items that will inspire tons of laughter from young and old. The old versus new isn't played out to make one seem better than the other, just different. Dracula is not as bad as one would think watching this movie and his concern for his daughter and her happiness is the center piece to the film. The love between the two is one that should be a good point for families once you get past the whole vampire thing.

The visual gags here fill the film from start to finish. It's one of those movies that you'll probably want to watch more than once just to catch the jokes you missed the first time. The writing is well done and offers just as many jokes as the visuals.

The animation here is fantastic. It still amazes me to see individual hairs on something like Dracula or Mavis in bat form. The detail is crisp and clear and to think that technology has come this far is astounding. The voice work is done incredibly well with cast members like Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Selena Gomez, Fran Drescher and Steve Buscemi.

HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is a movie that the entire family can enjoy together. It offers plenty of laughs and a touching story of father and daughter. It also offers a great launch pad for parents who would like their kids to know what the classic monsters were like. Who knows, maybe it will even inspire some to get their kids to watch those classic Karloff and Lugosi films.",1359417600,4,4390,4.534090909090909

5750593,4,B00CWZUOV6,"HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA, last fall's box-office hit from animator/director Genndy Tartakovsky and producer Adam Sandler, proves to be surprising fun. While animated at younger viewers, there's plenty of old-fashioned Movie Monster mayhem here to please fans of the Universal era with Count Dracula (voiced by Sandler) about to celebrate his daughter's 118th birthday by staging a massive party at his Transylvanian hotel, one devoted exclusively to Drac's monster pals. Crashing their undead-only event comes a young American backpacker (voiced by Andy Samberg) who develops an immediate attraction to the birthday girl, but Dracula quickly douses the happy-go-lucky kid in Frankenstein make-up so his human identity won't be revealed to the insular monster community.

Peter Baynham and comedian Robert Smigel are credited with the script for ""Hotel Transylvania,"" which - although saddled with a conventional and predictable story line - makes for good fun thanks to amusing humor and Tartakovsky's engaging animation, here rendered in 3-D CGI form. The filmmakers put a modern, comedic spin on the great monsters of the Golden Age (envisioning the Wolfman as a harried family man, for example) and punctuate the material with snappy visual gags and atmosphere that recalls a good Looney Tunes or Tex Avery cartoon spoofing the Karloff age. Naturally, kids will be the most receptive to ""Hotel Transylvania""'s charms, but that's of course the point: between the good-natured comedy and colorful design, it's no surprise younger viewers preferred this over Tim Burton's well-meaning but decidedly more downbeat ""Frankenweenie"" in theaters last fall.

Sony brings ""Hotel Transylvania"" to Blu-Ray this week in the form of a multi-disc 3D/2D presentation with corresponding DVD and Ultraviolet copies. Though produced to utilize 3D from the outset, there's little lost in the 2D Blu-Ray presentation since there are few pop-out effects. Both 1080p (1.85) transfers look great but colors, of course, are more satisfying in the 2D rendition. The DTS MA audio is nicely mixed, offering a better than expected score by Mark Mothersbaugh, while extras include a four-minute 2D animated short ""Goodnight Mr. Foot"" (animated in Tartakovsky's usual style), a commentary by the filmmakers, six minutes of deleted scenes, music videos, DVD-ROM content and format-exclusive progression reels and supporting featurettes.",1358985600,,2401,5.6115702479338845

5750596,4,B00CWZUOV6,"""Genndy Tartakovsky's first motion picture is at best his most interesting and vibrant work since Dexter's Laboratory and other collaborative efforts with The Powerpuff Girls. With a year of three ""horror-themed"" animated films, Hotel Transylvania is moreover the funniest and quirky out of the bunch. Not entirely meant to be taken seriously but it is still interesting to know what Tartakovsky and the folks from Sony Pictures Animation (which have brought only one good film in their roster, not in cooperation with Aardman, Open Season) can do with popular ghoulish figures and the way they animate themselves. As Dr. Mark Kermode (British film critic) pointed out, it is in many ways similar to Monsters, Inc. where an outsider/non-monster encounter intrudes the place. This is surprisingly good feature for the B-movie horror cliches and motifs are more prevalent but the film does suffer from lagging character development on some characters, occasional fast pacing, and a lackluster ending that will surely make the folks at Pixar be scratching their heads.""",1358899200,,1066,5.351190476190476

5750619,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I don't want to spoil anybody's experience explaining the movie itself in here. I just want to add that this story have some ""underline"" stories that are touching but also explained in a funny way; the father that wants to protect his daughter from the outside world but does not realize that our kids are just are a ""lend"" from life to us and someday they will go their own way, that they have to go to the outside world and learn from themselves even our best desires to protect them they will get hurt and learn from the experience and that's life something that all parents would empathize. The issue of acceptance of somebody just because is different it is also explained a human in a place of monsters, the issues with change and adaptation to new circumstances things that some adults will understand and appreciate and our kids will need to learn and assimilate. The animation is magnificent and my 5 years old found some parts hilarious (Frankenstein cannonball at the pool and further ""disintegration"").  There are some side jokes for adults that fortunately young kids most likely would not get. There are some characters that are simply hilarious such as Frankenstein, his wife, the couple of skeletons, the mummy, the werewolf, etc.
Like all this kind of movies the issues of love, parent's guidance, friendship, having fun and acceptance, change are masterfully displayed in my opinion. The movie is not too long like all kids movies should be.
The whole family really enjoyed watching this movie in the theatre and that's why we are ordering the DVD. Contrary to the opinion of others who think this movie is inferior to others (frankenweenie, etc) my son watched frankenweenie and he wanted to leave the theater before the movie ended, he was spooked by the ""not too beautiful"" characters and the darkness of Tim Burton, the fact the movie is black and white, etc, etc, etc.

5750634,3,B00CWZUOV6,"'Hotel Transylvania': More Monster High than Monster Mash

I'm a big fan of Genndy Tartakovsky's work on ""Samurai Jack,"" ""Sym-Bionic Titan,"" and the unsurpassed ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" shorts, so I was eager to see how he would fare as a director of a computer-animated film. As it turns out, his monsters have more bark than bite.

The problem with ""Hotel Transylvania"" isn't the animation (which is solid), the voice acting (which is amusing), or even the characters (which dutifully recall the monsters of yesteryear).  It's the entire premise for a family film: (one-hundred and-) 18-year-old daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) wants to see the world but her father Dracula (Adam Sandler) is terrified of humanity after his wife was killed by an angry human mob.  Humans in this world are the real monsters - you know, like ""Monsters, Inc."" only with more traditional critters from horror movie canon.

In honor of Mavis' upcoming birthday, all the family friends have been invited: Frankenstein's Monster (Kevin James) and his bride (Fran Drescher); a chubby mummy that's obviously based on the oft auto-tuned voice of Cee Lo Green; harried werewolf parents Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and Wanda (Molly Shanon); Griffin the invisible man (David Spade); and a litany of blink-and-you'll-miss it monster cameos. Drac decides to manipulate his daughter into staying at the hotel by terrifying her with an elaborate deception.  Then clueless traveling human hipster Johnny (Adam Sandberg) stumbles into the castle and suddenly Mavis' world is upended by evidence that humanity may not be that bad after all.

The plot bumps along unevenly. Never mind that nearly every single main character was arguably human at one point - Frankenstein's Monster is made of humans (a running joke to explain how Johnny, disguised as another Monster, is distantly related), Dracula was human, the werewolves are presumably human some of the time, Griffin is still human, the mummy was...you get the idea.  Quasimodo is the chief antagonist (Jon Lovitz), but last I checked he was human too.

The plot pivots on the ""zing"" - love at first sight, basically - but that concept is introduced before the big reveal of a gift from Mavis' mother that only reinforces what we knew all along about ""zinging."" The idea that my little girl might fall in love with the first man she meets also rubs me the wrong way...Mavis can't just explore the world on her own, she has to fall in love with a man (sparing her father the horror of dating!) so she transitions from protective father figure to protective boyfriend.

There's evidence of severe rewrites all over this script - since it's been in development since 2006 perhaps this is not surprising. It all culminates in a series of reveals and betrayals, which are resolved by our protagonists going on a road trip to reunite the two wayward souls.  Or at least it seems that way, until you realize that none of the supporting characters actually do anything at all.

""Hotel Transylvania"" regularly flirts with the difficult realities of monsters - at one point, Drac says, ""I can't kill him, it would set monsters back hundreds of years."" But this is a PG flick, so even the notion of vampirism isn't considered, which is a shame.  It's probably the only way Mavis and Johnny will ever truly be together.

Despite my qualms about the plot, this is a light-hearted love note to fans of monster movies and...their daughters. ""Hotel Transylvania"" hopes you fondly recall the horror movies of the past but not too much lest you remember that even vampires have to eat.  It's basically a paranormal romance disguised as a kid's movie.",1353369600,4,3644,4.950819672131147
5750635,4,B00CWZUOV6,There are so many animated features coming out daily and a lot of them hardly even qualify to be called mediocre.  Hotel Transylvania has a very cliched story line but it delivers it in a funny and original way.  You'll be laughing the whole movie!,1352678400,3,248,4.488888888888889
5750636,4,B00CWZUOV6,"My kids, especially my teenage daughter, loved this movie. The traditional monsters that we have known, (werewolf, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, mummy, invisible man, witches, gremlins, zombies, etc.) are not the evil beings that we are used to. Instead, they are just plain folks, but have been hunted and killed by human beings in the past. So Dracula has constructed a secret sanctuary where the monsters can come and chill out and he is a hotel manager a la Faultty Towers. Dracula is also superprotective of his daughter, Mavis, who has just turned (1)18 and who wants to go out into the world. Initially, the movie revolves around him being the hotel manager, and, in keeping his daughter safe.

Enter a human teenage boy, who wanders into the place and initially believes that everyone is wearing a costume. He meets Mavis and they instantly fall for each other, much to Dracula's irritation. He tries to get rid of the boy without the guests realizing that the hotel has been infected by a human and I will say no more.

Overall, it is a very good film, with only a couple of cliches here and there, with lots of visual and verbal jokes throughout. The werewolf, in particular, is hilarious. The film gets the conflict across very well of the dilemma of wanting to keep your family safe, yet realizing that the youngster must be allowed to spread their (bat)wings.",1352419200,5,1375,4.773109243697479
5750637,2,B00CWZUOV6,"There's not a lot to like about this movie.  Hotel Transylvania reads like a movie that is supposed to appeal to adults while also entertaining children, but it fails to deliver at its core: jokes.

Dracula is the proprietor of a hotel that serves as a getaway for monsters who are tired of beign pursued by mobs of humans.  Funny idea, but it's confusing at the start.  If the monsters are tired of being chased, where are they when they aren't at Hotel Transylvania?  Why didn't Dracula just build a place where they could live forever?  But setting that minor loophole aside, Dracula is supposed to be this misunderstood creature that only wanted to be left alone with his wife and child when a mob took his wife in a fire.  He's only a concerned father now, trying to protect his 100-something years young daughter from the menace that is humanity.  What he winds up being is a completely ball-less 'master' vampire who never bites anyone and is reduced to roaring at people when he gets upset.

But it's a children's movie, you say, of course Dracula didn't bite anyone.  That's not my fault.  Sony Pictures chose to make a movie about a monster that couldn't do anything monstrous.  I mean, if Lionsgate chose to make a children's movie starring Leatherface, you'd be a little off-put if he didn't chainsaw anybody, even though you knew it probably wouldn't happen.  So I'm saying a children's movie about classic horror monsters is a mistake in and of itself.

But since they insisted, well, what did work?  Adam Sandler's accent?  No, it made him cartoony to the point of silliness (again, I know it was a children's movie, but the accent just didn't work for me).  Jonathan was completely obnoxious throughout as was Mavis.  I was about to go through the list of characters, but it would just annoy me all over again.  I kind of liked Wayne the werewolf and Griffin the invisible man.  I enjoyed the zombies whenever they were on screen.  But I absolutely HATED the shrunken heads.

And the jokes themselves seemed put in as an afterthought.  The poorer children's movies have a tell that reveals them as the weak movies they are- senseless violence.  Remember how the minions in Despicable Me would punch each other for no reason and remember how nothing like that ever happened to Toy Story (you should get that I didn't think DM was any good)?  Hotel Transylvania's tell was Dracula roaring at everyone.  It wasn't really funny, they went to it too often, and it didn't make sense why anybody was afraid after he'd done that.

What did make me laugh, but struck me as undeservedly funny after I left the theater was near the end when Dracula saw part of a movie that was obviously a dig at Twilight with sparkly, shirtless vampire brooding in a forest.  Dracula makes a comment I can't remember about this being what people think of his kind even though Twilight's vampires actually eat people whereas Dracula doesn't seem to eat anything with a pulse in Hotel Transylvania.  It reminded me of what Roger Ebert said about Fun with Dick and Jane and the movie's lampooning of the failures of Wallstreet.  The movie just didn't deserve to make the joke because it hadn't earned it.

I would give this movie 2 out of 5 stars and that's only because my 5 year old enjoyed it.",1352160000,3,3283,4.6280276816609

5750640,1,B00CWZUOV6,"I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed at the movies.  This was a great idea for a movie, but in execution the filmmakers failed miserably.  This fodder is designed to appeal to the absolute lowest common denominator, with opportunities to poke fun at classic monsters wasted left and right.  I can't imagine anyone but the most ignorant of young children enjoying this bomb.  I love MAD MONSTER PARTY(1967) and hoped HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA would evoke its spirit, but the powers that be succumbed to fabricating a C-grade or lower product that gives in to playing it safe.  Way too safe, with chances to interest adults shunned in favor of attempts to entertain the widest possible contingency of youngsters who've spent every waking moment parked in front of free trash TV and Mom's boombox.  Stay away from this stinker.  I have high hopes that my upcoming outing to see FRANKENWEENIE will restore my faith in modern animated films.

5750643,5,B00CWZUOV6,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this (2 adults, an 8-year old, and 2 six-year olds) - it was our favorite of recent kid's movies. Adam Sandler stars as the voice of Count Dracula, widowed father to a daughter, Mavis, voiced by Selana Gomez. To protect her from humans - who he blames for his wife's death - he builds a hotel for monsters, where no humans are allowed. Frankenstein, Big Foot, mummies, werewolves, the Invisible Man and many more are all regular visitors and converge for Mavis's 118th birthday - clearly the equivalent of a human's 18th. Mavis is bored and would prefer to explore the human world - something her father does not want her doing. Things are thrown into chaos when a young hip human backpacker somehow wanders in, and he and Mavis fall for each other.

This movie is thoroughly entertaining, with many funny moments for kids and adults. The monsters are more comedic than scary, and most of the humor is warm-hearted, not mean-spirited like so many films are (even family films.) The plot ultimately revolves around the father daughter relationship between the Count and Mavis, and his having to accept her growing up, and in that sense it's downright sweet. A nice break from superhero battles. And this movie appeals to both genders - my daughters and son both enjoyed it equally. So I highly recommend it!",1350345600,2,1341,4.755364806866953
5750644,4,B00CWZUOV6,"The film opens with a loving nurturing Dracula caring for his daughter in 1895. In order to protect her from evil humans he constructs a huge castle as a refuge for monsters which include, Frankenstein, wolfman, invisible man, bigfoot, zombies, ghouls, Quasimodo etc. We then move to the present as his teen looking daughter turns 118 and wants to see the world. Before the first human shows up we already know the script.

There were a number of fun things about the monsters that kids would enjoy but adults will find tiresome. Dracula constantly denies saying ""blah, ba-blah, ba-blah."" There is one scene the kids laughed at and that was when someone pulled down the swimming trunks of the Invisible Man. He quickly pulls them back up, tells people ""I just got out of the pool! It's cold! Don't judge me!"" At one point the Invisible Man is playing charades, which he admits, ""I'm not very good at.""

At one point Dracula asks if humans would accept them (the monsters) if they ""came out."" I'm sure there was some kind of message there.

As an adult, I was basically bored with the film which had such great potential. 4 stars from a kids view. Not really scary or funny.",1350259200,,1173,4.6028708133971294

""Hotel Transylvania""
(Sony Animation, 2012)
-------------------------------------------------------
This kid-oriented animated comedy was an unexpected pleasure -- I went into it with my kid with mild dread, but enjoyed it from start to finish, and left the theater in a great mood. ""Hotel Transylvania"" is an extended spoof of classic monster-movie characters -- Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy, The Blob, et al -- with lots of unsubtle though entertaining jokes based on their various traits , and a simple, wholesome message about parents and kids learning to respect and love one another.

The story centers on daddy Dracula, who has retreated from the world and holed up in a remote castle which he built as a refuge for monsters who want a break from the hatred and persecution of monster-fearing, violent humans, and more importantly as a well-feathered nest for his daughter Mavis who -- at 118 years old -- wants to finally go see the world, but is still held back by her overprotective dad. Mavis is a stylish, laconic, Goth-y gal, sort of like the Incredibles' Violet but with a hipper haircut and some really cute little fangs. Like most of the characters, she isn't overdone; the tone is just right, as it is for her dad who, even though he's overbearing, is entirely likable and sympathetic. The script cheerfully traffics in formula and affectionately crafted cliches, as well as a nonstop barrage of inoffensive, kid-friendly humor (a few fart jokes, but nothing worse than that). It was just the right tone for families with younger children who want a macabre, monster-y theme, but don't want to get all Tim Burton-ed-out and irony-laden about it and don't want to see anything genuinely scary. If you liked ""Monsters Inc."" you'll probably enjoy this as well -- it's not as great a movie, but it's nice, light fun and works as well for Father's Day as for Halloween. Recommended!

5750646,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Sony Pictures Animation has never actually been able to keep up with the other big boy animators on the block. Movies like ""Surf's Up"", ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", ""The Smurfs"", ""Arthur Christmas"" and ""Pirates!"" never met the critical acclaim or the wide acceptance of some of the movies from Disney, Pixar or even Universal. Yet, teaming up with Columbia Pictures on ""Hotel Transylvania"" may have been a really good move.

With the voice talents of Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Cee Loo Green, Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi and David Spade, ""Hote Transylvania"" has something for everybody. There were times in the film that I was a little overwhelmed with the constant bombardment of characters and jokes, but eventually the movie settled down and capitalized off of some character development and brought some pretty good heart to the story.

""Hotel Transylvania"" has a lot of story and back-story, but it is all well explained and not your typical simple animated storyline. Dracula is raising his daughter, alone, so he builds a castle in the middle of Pennsylvania, fortified by rows and miles of zombie cemeteries and ghost forests. His hotel has become a fortress to keep he, his fellow monsters and most importantly, his daughter safe from the hateful murderous humans. His daughter is getting older though, she's 118 now and she has become too curious about the outside world and she wonders if humans are really how they've been portrayed.

""Hotel Transylvania"" is the Muppets, animated. There are a slew of characters who have gathered in one place for the birthday party of the century. All of the characters have their own personality and it reminded me of the Muppets as I watched it play out. Dracula, I compared to Kermit, trying to hold the show together as the onslaught of characters and personalities clashed. The jokes are fast and furious. Many of them aren't that funny, but I did notice that many of the jokes were tailored toward adults and many were ones that kids would find gut tickling.

Ultimately though, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a fun trip to the movies for all ages. Is it hilarious? I wouldn't say so. At times I found it funny, but when it was all said and done, I was sold on the personality and the heart behind it. Despite all the silliness and the constant playing up to the kids of our age with the music and the hyperactivity, somewhere in there, there was a whole lot of heart behind it all.",1349913600,2,2451,4.787234042553192

5750648,4,B00CWZUOV6,"""Hotel Transylvania"" has Count Dracula running a secret mountaintop hotel where all his monster buddies can blow off steam, away from a human world they believe is hostile to monsters.  This year's gathering is special: the (1)18th birthday of Dracula's cute daughter Mavis, who can't wait to get out and explore the world.  Her overly protective father has already lost a wife to an angry human mob and goes to great (and humorous) lengths to keep Mavis around the castle.  An uninvited guest in the form of a hipster young human male backpacker changes all that...

The animation is superb.  The cartoon monsters look incredibly life-like as they sing, dance, and squabble.  Among the guests at the hotel are the Mummy and his mate, Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, the Blob, and the Werewolf and his wife and pile of rambuctious pups.  There is an endless series of sight gags, ripped off from every monster movie ever made.  The excellent voic cast includes Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Selena Gomez.  All this fun nicely carries the movie, which has a thin and overly long plot. Portions of the movie may be too intense for small children, who may also not get some of the sight gags (well, let's hope so); recommended.",1349740800,,1239,4.779342723004695
5750649,2,B00CWZUOV6,"I decided to see Hotel Transylvania because I love animation and a friend of mine was begging me to go with her. I don't really pay attention to actors and had no idea Adam Sandler was in it, but even if I did, I probably wouldn't have cared. I don't have anything against the guy, unlike a lot of critics damning the film. My problems with ""Hotel"" has nothing to do with the voice cast and definitely not with the artwork. No, my gripe is that this movie plays like a kid with ADHD on a sugar high who just drank three pots of espresso.

It never shuts up. There is not a moment to breathe throughout the whole thing, not even during all of maybe three dramatic moments. Music is blaring, someone is shouting, things are zooming by, giant butts are farting-- there's always something ridiculous to ease any tension that might otherwise exist. The characters scream reference jokes while shoving your face in product placement. The whole movie felt like this to me: OMGMONSTERSWOWLETSGOFLYINGJUMPOFFHIGHDIVINGBOARDLOLHEBROKEAPARTTHATSFUNNYHAHAWHOFARTEDWASITYOUTHATSSOGROSSWIGGLEWIGGLEWIGGLE

BUTOKAYBECAUSEYOUREMAGICANDTHATMEANSITSFINERAVEPARTYGO

My God, the headache this thing left me with. There wasn't even time to laugh at a joke or appreciate the scenery because the movie would immediately pick you up, shake you and then chuck you into the next LMFAO reference. I remember laughing only once, during a very well timed and very funny Twilight jab.

There wasn't really any plot or character development. Nobody learns anything. The daughter wants something and then she gets it. Dracula hates humans but then he doesn't. Never mind that their choices are now 'turn kid into vampire' or 'watch him turn old and die in about 80 years'. Because hard things shouldn't be in a kid's movie, right? They're happy with farting and Dracula rapping, and that should be enough, right? They're only kids, after all, and they'll watch anything, right?

The bats were cute and the Twilight joke was funny. That's really all I can admit to enjoying about Hotel Transylvania. For what it's worth, my friend liked it and I think young kids probably will too. Personally though, I left the theater wishing we had just watched Paranorman or Frankenweenie again.",1349740800,8,2361,5.407608695652174
5750650,1,B00CWZUOV6,"My personal opinion

The Good:

Nothing was good about this movie.

The Bad:

1. Adam Sandler's Dracula voice
2. Overall plot was thin and required little imagination
3. Annoying characters that were LOUD throughout the movie
4. Animation wasn't particularly enjoyable to look at
5. Movie was comprised mostly of random scenes with boring jokes

Yes, I hated this movie.  It was completely boring.  The plot was dumb and uninteresting. The characters were annoying and the voices were grating.  Even for a kid's movie, this one is sub par to many other 3D animated kid's films past and present.",1349654400,10,594,4.929292929292929
5750651,3,B00CWZUOV6,"Hotel Transylvania has Dracula (Adam Sandler) as a peaceful monster who just wants a place for him and his monster buddies to have away from humans. So he turns his castle into a hotel. But eventhough Dracula wants to keep everyone inside and safe from angry mobs, his vampire daughter (Selina Gomez) wants to get out and explore the world.
  Dracula wants his daughter to think humans are all bad but when a harmless fun loving human (Andy Sanberg) wanders to the castle, Dracula tries to disguise him as a monster and sneak him out quickly. That doesn't go well since he meets Dracula's daughter and they hit it off without her knowing he's a human.
  The film may sound more like Hotel Happy Madison, since you have Sandler and his buddies like Kevin James (Frankenstein), Steve Buscemi (The Woofman) and the David Spade (The Invisibleman) doing voice work. However the film is better than most of their live action films and has much more of a plot than Grown-Ups did. I do admit though that it's not laugh out loud funny and that it mostly won me over with it's charm.",1349654400,14,1073,4.572916666666667
5750652,5,B00CWZUOV6,"I went into this movie not expecting anything. I saw the previews and it looked funny, but cheesy. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.

Has a few laughs for the adults and the kids were laughing all the way thru.",1349222400,13,313,4.147540983606557
5750653,4,B00CWZUOV6,"Hotel Transylvania, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky from a screenplay by Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel, is an animated comedy/horror-spoof, mostly for the kids but fast-paced enough and with enough humor to keep everyone entertained for an hour and a half. It's not as smartly written as 2010's Megamind or as sophisticated and dazzling as 2011's Rango, but it is fun to watch and satisfying in a popcorn-movie kind of way. Adult fans of old horror films will like spotting some of the more obscure monsters (Brain From Planet Arous anyone?) and picking up on some references that will sail over the head of younger viewers.

The plot begins in 1895 where we find a very paternal Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) looking after his infant daughter not long after the death of his wife. Determined to keep her safe from ""the humans"", Dracula comes up with an idea - to create a sanctuary, a place where monsters of all kinds can come to relax and be themselves without having to constantly worry about humanity coming after them with torches and pitchforks. He directs his servants to convert an old medieval castle hidden deep in the remotest part of Transylvania into a resort/retreat for monsters from all over the world, and voila! - the Hotel Transylvania is born.  The hotel is staffed, appropriately, by zombie bellhops, haunted suits of armor, housekeeping witches and talking shrunken heads, with a kitchen overseen by an obsessed lunatic chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz) and his pet rat Esmeralda.

Of course the years seem to fly by for a parent, even an immortal one, and before Dracula knows it suddenly it's 2012 and the day of Mavis's 118th birthday (that's 18 in human-growth years). The castle is filled with guests, many of them old friends of the family who've come especially for the occasion, including a very domestic Frankenstein (Kevin James) and his high-bouffant wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), a life-of-the-party mummy named Murray (CeeLo Green), a very frazzled werewolf named Wayne (Steve Buscemi in superb form), his highly-pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their pack of snarling hyper-active wolf kids, and Griffin, the Invisible Man (David Spade) who can't understand why he sucks at playing charades.

But this is also a day Dracula has dreaded as he promised Mavis (Selena Gomez) that on the day she turned 118, she had his permission to go out into the world. Compelled to keep his word but unable to face the prospect of Mavis going off into what he feels is a world too dangerous for her, he concocts a scheme to scare her into wanting to stay at the castle. Which works, somewhat to his surprise. But his scheme turns out to have unintended consequences and before Dracula has time to feel relieved, the unthinkable happens - a _human_ suddenly appears at the hotel, a young backpacker named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) who ""heard about this cool old castle"" and wanted to check it out. Panicking, and fearing for the reputation of his hotel if it were found out that a human was on the premises, Dracula quickly disguises Jonathan as ""Johnny-stein"", a supposed cousin of Frankenstein (actually just a cousin of Frankenstein's right hand, as it were). But before Dracula can get Jonathan out of the castle and out of his hair, Mavis and Jonathan meet and ""zing!"" it's love at first sight. The rest of the plot is rather predictable - over-protective father wants to keep boy away from his daughter, but daughter and boy keep seeing each other - but the pacing is kept fast enough and the humor abundant enough that it keeps things fresh and funny all the way through.  Particularly in scenes where Johnny's fun-loving nature livens things up by inadvertently starting a horses-and-riders pool fight, introducing some new music over the grumbling protests of zombie-Beethoven, zombie-Mozart & zombie-Bach, and engages Dracula in a floating-table race, causing the stiff and stuffy Count to unexpectedly rediscover what fun is.

The animation, while not ground-breaking, is well done, with a lot of attention to detail which gives the film a level of texture you wouldn't ordinarily expect in a light comedy. For example, at one point Mavis leads Johnny into a cave, the entrance to which some horror aficionados will recognize is shaped like the face of the Phantom of the Opera.  While Genndy Tartakovsky is well known for his work producing several successful TV animated series (Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, The Grimm Adventures of Billy & Mandy, The Powerpuff Girls and Star Wars: The Clone Wars), Hotel Transylvania is his first feature film.  Fans of Tartakovsky 's TV work might be expecting something more in the distinctive style he used in those shows, but I don't think they'll be disappointed with his choice to be more traditional here. The production design was done by Marcelo Vignali, who worked on several Disney films including Mulan and Lilo & Stich as well as Cloudy With Chance Of Meatballs, and the art direction was done by Ron Lukas and Noelle Triaureau, both of whom also worked with Vignali on 2007's Surf's Up.

The voice cast is excellent.  Adam Sandler, whom I don't usually care for as a rule, is actually quite good as the over-protective fatherly Dracula.  Andy Samberg brings out Johnny's guileless but ever-upbeat goofiness in a very winning way, while Selena Gomez brings the perfect touch as Mavis, the teenage vampire cutie who loves her dad and all his old weird friends but just wants to get out there and see the world she's only heard stories about.  Kevin James does an affable Frankenstein, and Fran Drescher is perfect as his loud and brassy Franken-wife, Eunice. CeeLo Green's Murray is the liveliest and hippest mummy you've ever heard.  As always though, it's Steve Buscemi who gets the best lines (or who makes his lines the best ones by his inimitably wry delivery) as the much put-upon buttoned-down-shirt-and-tie-wearing werewolf Wayne.  One of my favorite scenes is where Dracula, Frank and Wayne are trying to track down Johnny.  Dracula wants Wayne to follow his scent, and Wayne can only sigh wearily and ask ""Do you have _any_ idea what years of changing poopy diapers have done to this nose?""

Recommended as a fun enjoyable film for everyone and in particular for classic horror-film fans.",1349136000,155,6281,4.9393364928909955
5750654,5,B00CWZUOV6,"What a fun and heartfelt film Hotel Transylvania was when I recently attended a screening whereby producer Michelle Murdocca (Open Season 2, Stuart Little) explained, ""Executive producer and star, Adam Sandler did an amazing job joining this production late in its original inception. It took some 10 years to get this project in theatres,"" who herself was on the project from the beginning.

Russian born director Genndy Tartakovsky (Star Wars: The Clone Wars) says, ""It was a fun an amazing challenge to get this going and it was a real different environment working with a larger studio."" His attention to the details made this film work from page to screen.

The story centers around a place where all monsters can go to be themselves. Naturally walking around, celebrating anniversaries, eating as they do, sleeping the way they do, even swimming in pools and enjoying a night of fun and partying. The place (a really creepy castle) was built by Dracula himself (voiced amazingly well by Adam Sandler (Click, Bedtime Stories)) and because of an early accident due to the fear that monsters have toward humans, a tragic accident leaves him to be a single father. Raising and `protecting' his daughter from the outside world.

Mavis, his daughter, who is sharply voiced by Selena Gomez (The Wizards of Waverly Place, Another Cinderella Story) reaches her 118th birthday and decides she needs to see the world because of the sheltered life her father has created for her. Due to a series of mishaps and bad turn of events a `lie' goes very wrong and she soon realizes what she has been hidden from.

In steps a real human, quite by accident, Jonathan, played by Andy Samberg (SNL, That's My Boy), wanders his way into the hotel. Yet another lie, Dracula tries to cover his true human self and pass Jonathan off as a `real' monster. Another thing that Dracula didn't see coming was the moment that Mavis and Jonathan meet and their eyes connect, you guessed it, the real magic of the heart happens.

The screenplay by Peter Baynham (Borat, Bruno) and Robert Smigel (SNL, You Don't Mess With The Zohan) does something that most live-action screenplays try to achieve but never do,  it mixes some great fast paced visual gags with a real heart and real believable story. This movie is about a father and daughter relationship as well as misconceptions we all carry with us based on really never checking things out for ourselves.

This film has a great line-up of really hysterical characters including; Frankenstein voiced by Kevin James (King of Queens, Hitch); Mrs. Frankenstein Wanda voiced by Molly Shannon (Superstar, Analyze This); The Wolfman Wayne voiced by Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire, Grown-Ups) and his wife Eunice voiced by Fran Drescher (The Nanny, Beautician and the Beast); The Mummy Murray voiced by CeeLo Green (Kung Fu Panda, Kick Ass) and playing the hunchback Quasimodo is the voice of Jon Lovitz (Big, A League of Their Own).

Great for the Halloween theme and in full 3-D, this film was amazingly funny, and full of great classic-style sight gags that you'll probably need to see it more than once to catch them all. ""I took a lot of time to make sure this film worked on all levels. From the script to the performances and even the technology in making it,"" says the director Genndy . And you can really see it on screen!

What makes this animated feature by Columbia Pictures so good, is that it has a very big heart and an extremely relatable story to go with it. The whole family will really enjoy this film!",1349049600,31,3538,4.805921052631579
