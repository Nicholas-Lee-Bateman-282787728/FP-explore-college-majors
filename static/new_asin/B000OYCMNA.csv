8187656,2,B000OYCMNA,"Ranmaru Shindo learns more about the monsters plaguing the people of Japan whom are called Phantoms. He now wants to take the fight to the monsters by joining the secret organization within the police force called Tokko. -summary

Tokko is a 13 episode series directed by Masashi Abe and it's based on the manga written by Tohru Fujisawa. This second volume contains episodes 6 - 9. While re-watching this anime series I have been shaking my head like crazy at the disbelief that I actually found some type of enjoyment with this thing. Tokko Volume 2 manages to deliver a bit more story, but it's still just about as boring as the first volume.

In the last volume Shindo began unraveling some of the mystery behind these creatures. He learned their origin and purpose which is to feast on mankind, and the sink hole they appear through is a door to their dimension. He also learned more about the mysterious tattoo that appeared on his arm; this tattoo is the symbol of a phantom living within Shindo which makes him into a symbiote, and in order to kill the monsters he must awaken his phantom. This is also the case with those other members of Tokko and how come they are able to form weapons and kill these creatures. The creatures dimension can be sealed off permanently, by killing 108 of the main monsters as they leave behind a fragment of a magical box that can seal their gate. Make no mistake about it, although my description of this series may sound exciting, it's no where near as good as it sounds because the writing is so dull in pushing the paper thin to the next.

The plot continues to reveal more of the story such as other organizations that are either fighting the monsters, or hoping to reach some type of truce. Most of these things are only mentioned and receive no type of insight which is a shame, because the main characters are so tiring, boring, and by the numbers, they can't really carry the plot. There isn't a single interaction that stood out to me as the least bit arousing, no matter what subject was going on each segment was just as boring as the last; and does this anime know how to drag its feet. There's more filler within each episode than something of substance.

I also couldn't get over the plot holes. It was long established that fire arms are useless against these creatures and the only people who can hurt or kill them are the symbiotes using swords. In the last volume, Chief Kunikida was swiss cheesing them with a M249 machine gun with no effect at all. Now a character whom works with Tokko is blowing holes through them with a pistol and she is not a symbiote. Lazy writing to deliver action and nothing else. The writers also fail to understand that flashbacks are not character development; this is something you see a lot in anime. These people think adding a tragic back story to a 2 dimensional character (if that) automatically equals depth. They are so misguided.

The visuals are still fine and are probably the only highlight going on here. The backgrounds for both night and day settings along with various scenery are still done well. The monster designs are not as appealing as before, but they're still interesting in some way. The amount of gore hasn't change, and if you bought heavily into the action last volume then it's more of the same for your enjoyment. Personally it does nothing for me with its shaky choreography; I'm just not a fan of the sword swipe across dark screens and static backgrounds, followed by falling body parts. All of the segments aren't like these, but this is what I remember most since it is in abundance.

Tokko Volume 2 offers little; with its stale characters, non engaging interactions, and that blonde whore failing to be cool and sexy, I just can't recommend this to anyone other than the very easy to please. There's something else I want to say that relates to the final volume and whether or not you should even step into this series at all. I'll save that for later. If you just want a dark anime with action and a good story then you're better off with Speed Grapher. There's plenty more titles light years better than this, but that was the first to cross my mind.

Pros: Visuals, some story development

Cons: Characters are still boring and story is badly paced",1451520000,,4279,4.577023498694517
