7925078,4,B00004WG4Q,"On a production level this second season, produced 3 years later seems
actually less sophisticated; cheap looking sets, much more of a
standard sit-com look.

But this is a sit com ala Fawlty Towers, weird, whip-smart, subversive
and very dark. While I can't say for me that it quite stands up to the
greatness of Fawlty Towers or Monty Python, the two shows to which it
is inevitably compared, it has a ton of very funny moments, and the
acting is top notch.

It's 100 years plus since series one, and Blackadder is no longer the
weaselly immoral wimpy swine of the first series. He's now a handsome.
dashing weaselly immoral swine, a favorite of the vaguely insane Queen
Elizabeth --that is when she's not threatening to execute him.

It's a lot of fun to see Atkinson in this very different, non Mr. Bean
persona, and he pulls it off wonderfully. And Hugh Laurie is hysterical
in two completely different guest roles, while Miranda Richardson as
Queen Elizabeth displays a flair for goofy silly physical comedy one
would never suspect from her body of work.

Very worth a view, even if you were iffy on series one.",1343433600,,1117,4.654822335025381
7925079,4,B00004WG4Q,"In this series, the peculiar ""Black Adder"" family once again find karma together in the Elizabethan period, with Rowan Atkinson incarnated as Lord Edmund, thwarted and blocked at every turn by circumstance as well as his dimwitted servant, the unctuous Lord Percy, and the impossible Queen Bess (Miranda Richardson) and her attendant, Lord Melchet (Stephen Fry).
These episodes pass the ""feet up in the air while laughing test,"" especially Edmund's coversation with Captain Redbeard in ""Potato,"" in which he seeks to outdo Sir Walter Raleigh and explore uncharted territory.  If Raleigh's voice sounds familiar, you may be recognizing actor Simon Jones from HITCH-HIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, in which he played Arthur Dent.  Captain Redbeard, meanwhile, is none other than Tom Baker, who played Doctor Who for six years.
Along with the episodes ""Bells"" (in which Edmund falls for a manservant who is a woman in disguise) and ""Head"" (in which Edmund is appointed executioner, executes the wrong man at the wrong time, and hatches no less than two hilariously desperate plots to cover up the mistakes and save his own head) demonstrate some brilliant comic writing and an excellent ensemble.  (And an irritating laugh track - ignore it as best you can.)",993859200,,1252,5.157635467980295
7925080,5,B00004WG4Q,"Here's a British TV comedy series that puts American sit-coms to shame with its biting wit and comic sensibilities. Black Adder surpasses Mr. Bean (which I also enjoy) and is up there with Fawlty Towers. It helps to know some English history and some Shakespeare, but not necessary. (My 11-year-old son loves the series.) I just discovered the Black Adder tapes at the video rental and am working my way through them. Saw II - Part 1 last night, and this is some VERY funny stuff. Some of the humor is rather daring for the period this was made (a LOT of sexual humor generally and the gender-bending of ""Bells"" specifically), but I guess British TV was more relaxed than the American networks back in the early 80s. Every time Black Adder encounters witches, it's a hilarious take on those Shakespeare plays you read in high school.",992217600,,833,4.673469387755102
7925081,5,B00004WG4Q,"I adore British Comedy. I have seen every episode of Red Dwarf, Being  Served, and Black Adder ever written.  Black Adder II, Parte the Firste is  by far my favorite Black Adder tape.  Miranda Richardson Plays a wonderful  Queenie, Tony Robinson returns from Black Adder one as the faithful  Baldrick, Tim McInnery is the ""pea-brained"" Percy, and Rowan  Atkinson... Well, who else could play a role like the Black Adder?  Thankfully he has a much better haircut than in the last episodes.  We also  see the character Lord Flasheart (Rik Mayall), and ""Bob"" in  Bells; two characters which we see in later episodes.",965606400,3,613,4.854368932038835
7925082,5,B00004WG4Q,"Those who were considering Benny Hill, you have found two of the true  geniuses of British comedy--Rowan Atkinson and Ben Elton.
This is the  best of the Black Adders. Stunningly good. Superbly fine. You must own  this, whoever you are.",965260800,,236,4.85
7925083,5,B00004WG4Q,"Blackadder is the best comedy series to have come from the shores of the UK since Fawlty Towers. Writer Richard Curtis, he of Four Weddings and Notting Hill shows us his true comedic routes. Linked with the excellent  writing of Ben Elton (The Young ONes), and the outstanding performances of  all the cast, most notably Mr Rowan Atkinson himself, makes this 'side  splitting', (unless you have worn your corset). The humour is clever, dry,  sarcastic and full of wit. I would recommend anybody who has never  experienced the world of BlackAdder to purchase this tape, and also tape 2  of series 2. For me, series 2 is the high point of the 4 series comedy so  is an excellent start to a collection. So, again, if you haven't witnessed  BlackAdder, buy this. It is the best.",946252800,2,774,4.639705882352941
