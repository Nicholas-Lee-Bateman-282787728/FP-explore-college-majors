After watching ""Russkie Bez Rosii"" for the fifth time, I am again stunned by the comedic genius of producer Nikita Mikhalkov (""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker""). The only drawback to this magnificent film is the exclusion of my favorite Russian comedians, Yakov Grot and Olga Korbut.

The scene where Boris Spassky is unwittingly seduced by Anna Kournikova -- disguised as an inebriated Peter Sellers! -- is alone worth the hefty price of this DVD. Surely it can't get better than this!

A well-deserved four stars, only because the color transfer was slightly off during the snowy scenes.",1121731200,,635,4.925233644859813
8050941,5,B0007R8ZVM,"This is the series originally made for the Russian television by the great filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov.

Dedicated to Russian emigres, the film shows video archives from the late 1910s-early 1920s depicting the massive exodus of of the Russians following the revolution of 1917 and the civil war that had split the Russian society into the ""whites"" and ""reds"". The ""whites"" were the officers of the tsarist army, aristocrats and intelligentsia staying in opposition to the Bolshevik regime.

The main characters of the documentary are admiral Kolchak, generals Denikin and Vrangel, admiral Berens and some other ""white army"" commanders. The film contains rare footage, old photographs, many interview. Mikhalkov himself is the narrator.",1119571200,,735,5.553571428571429
