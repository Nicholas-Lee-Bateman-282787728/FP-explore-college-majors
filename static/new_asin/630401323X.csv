768085,4,630401323X,"The story line is basic - but in 1950, a voyage to the Moon was a strong plot. The acting is just as basic. But the film was a breakthrough and ushered in the era of believable SF. The transfer is sadly deficient: poor  source material, faded color (yellows and greens are severely diminished)  and the DVD clearly is a transfer from a LaserDisc (image and sound flaws  are typical of an LD). Nonetheless, this is one film which every film/SF  buff must have. It is still an engrossing experience. It still is full of  wonder. It still is a tribute to the very human need to explore -  ""just because it's there"".",953078400,8,612,4.371681415929204
768086,4,630401323X,"This is a significant movie in the history of science fiction cinema, but it's hit and miss as a movie.  The special effects, especially the matte paintings by Chesley Bonestell, are outstanding, but the story is pretty  thin and the characters are strictly two dimensional.  It was one of the  first movies to treat space travel scientifically and that was both a good  and bad thing.  It created a sense of reality in the story that is fairly  effective, but at the same time some of the exposition is pretty dry (even  Woody Woodpecker can only do so much with it) and the big crisis at the end  of the movie doesn't involve us as much as it should.
The DVD is also hit  and miss.  When it's good, the video is pretty impressive for a 50 year old  movie, but there are a lot of frames marred by scratches.  The color is  true and the picture is sharp but the scratches become distracting at  times.  The audio also displays a surprising amount of noise for a DVD  transfer.  It's a shame this movie hasn't been restored to better  condition.  There are no extras except for an interesting printed history  of the film on the despised snap case.
Despite my caveats, I do think  this is a must for any serious collector of sci-fi film.  As others have  commented, Destination Moon made space travel believable to the public and  paved the way for the real space program.  And it is especially desirable  for any Heinlein fan.  Even with its faults, this is certainly the best  treatment his work has had on film so far.",951955200,8,1520,4.445255474452555
768087,1,630401323X,"This is NOT the same as Destination Moon made from The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.  The reviews here are WRONG, they apply to a different video.
This is one in a 13-part series called Dreams of Flight produced  by the Smithsonian.  It may be a wonderful documentary, I wouldn't know so  ignore the score I gave it. (I got it by mistake and am exchanging it).",945993600,5,356,4.268656716417911
768088,4,630401323X,"I wish to ""ditto"" everything that has already been said about this movie, but with one caveat.  It *is* an excellent movie for all the resons already noted but on todays stereo,high-fidelity systems (mine), I  notice a lot of tape hiss and high end noise that is quite distracting and  at times almost intolerable.  If you play this tape on speakers with good  reproduction in the high ranges you might find the high frequency whine a  bit hard to take.",944006400,3,453,4.6
768089,5,630401323X,"I originally caught this movie on cable and was intrigued. After finding out it was based on the novellette by the late Robert Anson Heinlein, I simply had to get a copy for myself. It is even better without the  commercials. It is technically accurate and the direction of George Pal  (The Time Machine) makes it a classinc with slick (for the time) special  effects. It doesn't have a lot of eye popping effects as modern day movies,  but the sets and characters are very memorable along with the excellent  backgrounds painted by the late Chesley Bonestell (his art before the days  of actual pictures of the moon surface and other locales are classical and  surprisingly accurate). The rocket set and special effects of the space  flight are believeable to anyone that followed the Apollo missions of the  1970's (and this was over 20 years before Apollo). It is technically  accurate and visually brilliant, a must for any Sci-Fi collection, and a  necessity for the Heinlein fan's collection.",913334400,6,998,4.880952380952381

768230,5,630401323X,"Destination Moon and another George Pal film, War of the Worlds, rank very near the top of my favorite classic sci-fi film list.  Although we can look back at some of the way-off assumptions of what the moon is like or how space travel is done in this film, it is what science thought at the time and it only helps to create an entertaining film.  It's funny how a lot of the early films like this one thought space travelers (not yet called astronauts) would just put on regular street clothes and fly into space.  If you've seen the recent film The Martian with Matt Damon, you'll notice a very close similarity to what happens in Destination Moon on what they have to do to escape the Moon's gravitation.  Matt Damon has to do the same thing to leave Mars.  These movies often had at least one cliche character.  Destination Moon had the New Yorker.  Rocketship X-M had the Texan.  One of my favorite scenes is their acting during the takeoff when they try to show the effect of g-forces on their faces.  This is a must see if you like old sci-fi.",1463529600,,1050,4.371134020618556

768323,5,630401323X,"Destination Moon set the standard for a lot of space films to come, pushing technical accuracy to a new level based on what science fiction writers and rocket pioneers were speculating in 1950.  The story was written by Robert A. Heinlein and was filmed at a time when Americans didn't expect their government to be responsible for all great accomplishments, so as one might expect the flight to the moon is accomplished by a coalition of industry leaders.  This was 8 years for President Eisenhower formed NASA, and 11 years before President Kennedy changed it all into a cold-war political stunt intended to be ""more impressive to mankind and so expensive to achieve.""  (That's  quote from JFK's moon speech.)

Of course, the technologies of both spacecraft and movie production are as dated as all the inevitable tropes and memes from the period, but these do not detract at all from enjoying this cinematic marvel for what it is.",1451347200,,933,4.879746835443038

768396,5,630401323X,I enjoyed this one very much. The quality of sound was a bit off but raising the volume level took care of that. This movie was made just five short years after the end of the war and to see what scientists thought was the look of future space craft was a hoot. The color process was very interesting indeed. Little did we know at the time of this movie magic that it would only be nineteen short years later that we would actually land on the moon.

768545,4,630401323X,"The production values have changed somewhat in 65 years! However, George Pal did produce a movie with many of the scientific aspects right on with what we have witnessed since the space program began in the 60s.  Everybody did a great job with their acting but many of us who enjoy the Schanrock would be able to see simple scientific values being overlooked which might not have been a parent when the movie was made in 1950. That being said, this movie was quite entertaining with significant suspense and a believable plot from beginning to end. Definitely a classic.  Watching ""the Day the Earth stood still"" produced only one year later (1951) you can see a significant difference in the polished appearance of the latter movie. There are different approaches to be made, but I did not find this movie as pleasing. It was still enjoyable and worth having if you enjoy this genre.",1430784000,,884,4.733766233766234
768546,5,630401323X,"This isn't that much of a stand alone sci-fi drama as it is a bit of historical interest.  Compared with some space adventure like Star Wars it's dry and academic. Everyone in the movie is always making some point about the physics of real space travel. It's ore like a science class than a good yarn. Kubrick's 2001 was similar in many ways but Kubrick was perhaps even more extreme up until the point where he went all psychedelic.

Kubrick's 2001 is deadly slow. Everything takes forever to unfold. Destination Moon moves along a bit faster than that but it is still like a documentary teaching us about space travel with a light wrapping of a story.

I believe this was the first space movie that instituted the dramatic practice of including a low comedian among the crew. Certainly there were a lot of fifties space movies that had a goofy guy on board the space ship for comic relief. In fact however the real astronauts were all dry, humorless characters selected for their lack of any kind of personality.

I seem to remember that I had read the Heinlein stories on which the screen play is built. My memory may have deceived me but I think I remember the trick with the rope pulling the space suit out the door. This sort of plot device probably plays better on the page than it does on the screen. In those days a lot of early science fiction was a kind of science puzzle. Much later most of the Science Fiction by Larry Niven was also of this kind. You as the reader were challenged to figure out the puzzle of the story before it was explained to you in the final paragraph. These stories were kind of like detective who-done-its. But it is notable that Niven - one of the greatest Master of Sci-Fi - has never had much success on the screen. Rather than following detective story models for movie scripts, the big Sci-Fi movies have mimicked Westerns.",1430265600,,1865,4.492625368731564

Considering the book was written in the 1940's and the movie was made before the NASA Apollo program got rolling, the story itself borders on prophetic. Heinlein sat in as a guest commentator during the Apollo 11 mission and the parallels drawn by some of the Scientists showed that Heinlein had an almost detailed understanding of the principles involved. This movie is one of the best examples of early SciFi.",1425859200,,503,4.662921348314606
768632,5,630401323X,"Throughout the 1950s, most Sci-Fi movies were pretty hokey -- especially their special effects.  But ""Destination Moon"" is different.  Not only was it filmed in Technicolor (rather than the more-common B&W), but the storyline and technical details are still fairly believable.  For a movie released in 1950, that's pretty unusual.  Further, given the era, the special effects were quite good: in fact, it won an Oscar for ""Best Special Effects.""  As a Sci-Fi movie buff, I consider ""Destination Moon"" among the five best movies of that genre that were made in the 1950s.",1425513600,,570,5.086021505376344

It is a movie where man has never tried flying in space, so these scientist build a rocket, to make sure that America has control of the moon so that missiles can not be launches at us by foreign powers. The whole time there are people trying to stop them at every turn.  But just as an attempt to stop this is about to be successful, they jump in their ship and take off.

This thoroughly entertaining movie was made 19 years before astronauts really went to the moon, and it depicts a trip to the moon with an attempt at scientific accuracy.

It was filmed in technicolor, and has very impressive sets and special effects by George Pal. A group of astronauts travel to the moon, and deal with some discomfort at accelerating through outer space at a faster speed than anyone had ever traveled before. Once on the moon, the astronauts discover they can effortlessly jump several feet in the air and float gently to the ground, due to the moon's low gravity. (This brief scene stayed with me. It made a trip to the moon look so fun!) The earth is visible from the moon's sky.

Things go awry when it comes time for the astronauts to head home. It appears that they might not have enough fuel left to make it all the way back to earth, unless one of them stays behind in order to reduce the amount of weight on the ship.

""Destination Moon"" is not exclusively for kids, although I think most kids will enjoy it. Early in the film, astronauts are shown an animated astronaut training film with Woody Woodpecker, which might give this film some additional kid appeal.

When an attempted satellite launch fails, funding for further space projects starts to dry up. Instead, American industry decides to work together to create a Moon rocket to send men to the Moon and back. Despite public fears over the use of atomic fuel on the rocket, the crew decide to launch anyway.

When it comes to the story, it is a little on the weak-side considering the hour-and-a-half running time of the film. The real reason to see this film is that it is an outstanding example of early science fiction.

He was a leading Hollywood proponent of science fiction and fantasy special effects in the late 1940s through the mid 1960s. His production of Destination Moon was released in 1950, years before spaceflight actually began. For kids in the 1950s this was an inspirational and exciting story, even though we had no idea as to its accuracy. Viewing it now as an adult is a sudden return to childhood, with the added appreciation of a vision of spaceflight that turned out to be astonishingly accurate in many respects.

Recall that this was years before even an unmanned satellite had been launched. Watch the countdown and launch, the depiction of the effects of acceleration and weightlessness, going from the pressurized interior of the spacecraft to the vacuum of space, moving on the lunar surface, the appearance of spacesuits, the vital calculation of weight for takeoff, and numerous other details. This accuracy is not so surprising when you find that the film was based on a story by Robert Heinlein, who also had a hand in writing the screenplay.

As a child I was fascinated by this story, and I had the record as well as seeing the film at a theater. The comic relief character in the movie was replaced by a young boy in the recording, with whom other young boys were supposed to identify closely. And many did, and likely some girls as well.

The quality of this production was recognized with an Academy Award for best special effects. The DVD is an un-restored copy from a print in good condition, and very enjoyable.

769119,3,630401323X,"*** This review contains a SPOILER ***

I always hesitate to negatively review a science fiction film, since there's no shortage of negative perception about SF in general, but in my opinion this film is only interesting from a historical perspective, and them only mildly. While its attempt at scientific accuracy is sometimes commendable (but only sometimes), and Heinlein's technical oversight is apparent, the film simply suffers from far too many of the flaws that plague Hollywood's attempts at SF even today. The simple is made complex and the complex becomes simple, all for the sake of film-making convenience and cheesy melodrama. The directing is hopelessly amateurish (Pichel was clearly making up much of the blocking and scene detail on the fly), Fegte and Sawley's production design is so simplistic it borders on cartoonish (the industry's attitude about SF -- that it's primarily the domain of pre-teen boys -- really shows up here), and the acting is abysmal. All the actors demonstrate the stage presence you'd expect in a high school production, and sound like either bad stand-up comics (especially the Joe Sweeney character) or voice-over actors reading product promotions from scripts. (I kept expecting someone to turn to the camera at any moment and say ""Try our new and improved Luster Cream Toothpaste today, folks -- it will brighten your teeth AND your day! And nine out of ten astronauts recommend it!"".)

Speaking of scripts, this one is so poorly written I'm surprised Heinlein supposedly had a hand in it. Dialogue is comic-book quality, invariably so forced as to be unintentionally comedic. Characterization is non-existent. Pacing is hideously uneven. and the plot, such as it is, provides little to hold the viewer's interest. And of course *** SPOILER *** everything works out just dandy in the end.

I love science fiction, and some vintage SF films like ""Forbidden Planet"" are favorites of mine. But this one? It's a curiosity, perhaps, and I can't argue that it at least tries in some ways to be serious about space travel. But a high-quality film it is not, and it hardly merited the retroactive Hugo Award it received in 2001.

At least it's mildly entertaining to watch the actors try to walk around in those ridiculous zip-up ""magnetic boots"" that hardly stay on their feet and apparently aren't even substantial enough to keep their feet from sliding off the soles. You'd think the producers could have spent more than 50 cents a pair to make something so central to the illusion of mobility in a zero-G environment.

I'm giving this film 3 stars out of respect for Heinlein and for the fact that it actually predicted, albeit in a fairly silly and ham-fisted way, the privatization of space exploration, but I'm being extremely generous.",1374451200,,2784,5.017316017316017

769122,4,630401323X,"The only reason I wanted to see this film is because it was based on a book by Robert A. Heinlein, and he co-wrote the script. After a few more Hollywood ventures he gave up on the movie business and concentrated on writing novels and stories.
The first thing that strikes you is the 1950 fashions, the boxy suits. The film is in color, unusual in 1950. The head of a private aircraft company is persuaded to take on the project of a rocket to the moon. The government is convinced to back the project when it's pointed out that whatever nation controls the moon will render all other nations helpless. This is an overstatement, to put it mildly, but certainly the Apollo program was probably mostly based on that theory. The presentation is made in part with the use of a Woody Woodpecker cartoon to explain the mission and the science.
Somewhat hilarious is the idea that once the rocket is built, the crew is given 72 hours to launch it. And it takes off just in time, before a court order is delivered to shut it down. Because one of the crew members is unavailable, an uneducated mechanic from Brooklyn is recruited for the mission. He provides the comic relief.
Once the mission is in space, what's impressive is the amount of stuff Heinlein got right. The experience of G-forces at lift-off is really well-portrayed, so much so that I wonder how they did it. Weightlessness, check. The crew uses magnetic boots to move around the capsule while in flight, which got me wondering why NASA never used that idea, as far as I know. Apparently they determined that just getting used to weightlessness was the way to go. The touchdown on the moon, using the rocket itself for a vertical descent, of course does not match what actually happened with the use of the Lunar Module, but what is fascinating is how the commander's search for an appropriate landing site with seconds ticking away is so similar to Neil Armstrong's actual experience trying to land the Lunar Module.
The moonscape isn't bad, and the way the astronauts got around in the one sixth gravity is a pretty good approximation of how it looked on the Apollo mission.
The drama at the end revolves around the crew's need to get rid of as much weight as possible to achieve liftoff from the Moon. Then, no denouement upon their return, that's it.
It's worth keeping in mind that many studios rejected this film because the idea of humans going to the moon was just preposterous. So kudos to George Pal, Heinlein, and the others for getting this movie made.",1371513600,4,2521,4.604444444444445

Thank goodness there was plenty of comic relief courtesy of Dick Wesson (as the conscripted member of the trip to the moon).

769279,5,630401323X,"Destination Moon (1950) Was Another Intelligent, Well Done George Pal Movie,

DESTINATION MOON (1950) was produced by the legendary George Pal (see his [...] biog), and was one of the first great full color 1950's sci-fi outer space thrillers which later included WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE (1951), THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953), THIS ISLAND EARTH (1955), and FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956).

The movie is intelligent, interesting, dramatic, and highly informative about basic science facts regarding space travel and the difficulties, challenges part of it.

By any standard, DESTINATION MOON (1950) is a landmark movie, produced in 1950 which was a high water mark year for world cinema, along with 1939, 1928, and 1956........all years notable for multiple cinema productions of remarkable accomplishment and enduring quality.

The story is about a successful first flight to the moon, made by four men who travel in a spacecraft built by a private USA company which must take off unexpectedly early because a ""court order"" has been issued and is about to be delivered to the space travelers STOPPING the trip due to the fact that public opinion is fearful of the consequences of any such effort.

The four man team learn of the court order and decide to take off early, before govt. officials can ""serve them"" and stop their departure.

The space ship lands on the moon, and the commander claims the moon for the USA on behalf of all mankind in a statement quite similar to the actual statement the first NASA moon landing astronauts made famous in 1969 (the ""one small step for man, one giant step for mankind"" statement).

Suddenly, the four moon explorers learn the space ship they need for return to the Earth is too heavily loaded for departure from the moon, and that they need to unload large quantities of equipment and supplies to lighten the ship and make departure possible.

They pitch out large quantities of ""junk"" including used oxygen tanks, radios, and other large metal objects, but in the end, not enough has been removed....110 pounds remain! All four travelers separately volunteer to remain behind, and one (the comic ""Joe Sweeny from Brooklyn"") actually leaves the ship and refuses to return so his remaining three comrades can leave safely.

His sacrifice isn't necessary, however, since the ship commander determines that the remaining radio used for contact with the Earth can also be thrown off the ship, and so can the one space suit held back and worn by Joe Sweeny, once he returns to the ship.

Sweeny does return to the ship and all four travelers depart successfully from the spacecraft after the radio and space suit are thrown out, and the needed weight removal is accomplished.

The ship returns to the Earth with all four travelers safely aboard. The final end credit appears over the outer space scene showing the space ship returning from the moon to the earth after the very first space voyage to the moon by people from Earth.

The final credit for DESTINATION MOON (!950) reads ""This is THE END..Of The Beginning."" DESTINATION MOON (1950) is a landmark science fiction space travel movie, and should be seen by all interested in this genre, and by all interested in high water mark quality cinema movies remarkable for creativity and intelligence.

I bought it purely for this because we already owned a VHS copy without captions, and my wife cannot hear.  I've rated it as low as possible because of this.  With captions, I'd have given it a 3, maybe even 4.  It's very dated, but was the space movie that got me started building rockets at age 13.  I designed and built a 3' tall, 8"" diameter copy of this moon rocket.  Didn't fly it, but later built and flew many rockets.  October Sky is story of my young life, much like Homer Hickams, even to point of being arrested for firing off a rocket.  Neither of us prosecuted though; we hadn't hurt anyone or anything.  Homer went much farther than I did, even becoming a rocket engineer with NASA, then an author.  For it's day this was an outstanding movie, I thought--very moving and inspiring.  Seems a little dull now, my wife thinks--and so do I.  But, I still love watching it every now and then for nostalgic value if nothing else.  We have 2 copies in our collection now; that's unique!!!",1351296000,3,1097,4.398009950248756
769281,5,630401323X,"I gave this film a five star rating not because of its acting, which was a mediocre at best and some what ""hammy"" at times, and not because of the special effects which were OK as the film was made way before computer animation, but in spite of these.  Heinlein was way in front of the curve in most of his writing and this effort is no exception. At a time when 99% of sci-fi films and novels where at best laughable, with goofy looking monsters, B acting(?) and even worse writing Destination Moon was an attempt to show the public at that time what was possible and indeed a probable future of space exploration and to me it did this very well.

It's strictly 50s with nuclear nerves and the race for space in post war America. Robert Heinlein is credited as a screenwriter and the film is partially based upon his novel ""Rocketship Galileo"".  I've seen the film countless times and that's why this dvd appealed to me.  Nice case, too bad the quality of the disc was lacking.  The colors (especially those wild moonsuits) seemed muted. The sound was muted too.  I had to crank the volume on my tv up to levels I'd never seen before just to make the dialog clear.  Since it touts itself as an ""anniversary edition"", I would think that it would have been a quality presentation.  A great flick presented with faded images and POOR sound...what a letdown.",1343779200,2,817,4.671328671328672
769283,5,630401323X,"Every now and again a movie is made that raises the bar for the realism and enthusiasm, in the science fiction genre. A handful of films come to mind, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars and Alien. Destination Moon was the Space Odyssey of it's day in the 1950s. While there were many sci-fi movies made at the time, few have dared to aspire to the heights of accuracy and attention to detail that Destination did. It is very refreshing to see the degree to which the makers of this suspenseful feature, have gone to capture the laws of physics, with respect to the launch, busing phase and landing on the Moon.

This is really a delightful and still believable trip to the Moon. Definitely worth adding to the collection of sci-fi classics!",1325030400,4,746,4.525925925925926

769286,5,630401323X,"Destination Moon deserves its reputation as an influential classic in the genre. The science is sound for the time. That government is portrayed as an inept villain standing in the way of private industry serving the country best reflects Heinlein's rather Libertarian viewpoint. And ignoring public clamour opposing the potentially dangerous takeoff of an atomic-powered spaceship as being nothing more than artificial protest engineered (it is implied) by 'outside forces' speaks to the times as well. All part of the time capsule aspect of the movie. The quality of the image is pretty good. The colourful visuals stand out well. The film is quietly entertaining. Overall, a must for any collector interested in the development of the SF movie genre. This was a milestone.",1306454400,,775,5.258064516129032
769287,4,630401323X,"Co-written by top science fiction writer Robert Heinlein from his novel, this is in many ways the opposite of the lower-budget, black-and-white&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocketship-X-M/dp/6305869367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocketship X-M</a>, which was rushed into production and beat MOON to theaters.  X-M was ambivalent about science and pacifistic in approach, while MOON takes what we would now call an aggressively libertarian, pro-corporate and anti-government stance, as an inventor, an engineer/industrialist, and a military man get together to build a rocket, and fly it to the moon in the face of government and popular opposition. Because they have to beat the ""red menace"" of the Soviet Union to the Moon, see, and claim the whole thing for the United States, so that WE can be the ones to build weapons there.  When people talk about the paranoia and anti-communist sentiments of the 1950s, and particularly of the newly popular science fiction genre, this is what they're thinking of in bold, screaming headlines.

DESTINATION MOON takes a long time to get going, with more than a little too much tedious exposition, and none of the astronauts, who are the only significant characters are terribly interesting.  They end up being the three I've already mentioned, and some guy from Brooklyn. Yep - not exaggerating - some working-class shlub who they happen to pull in because the regular radio guy gets sick ends up being America's first ""ethnic"" astronaut, and boy is he (Dick Wesson's the actor) a walking set of stereotypes. As bad as some of the dialogue and situations involving Osa Massen's character are in X-M are, Wesson's character is just awful and looks pretty embarassing now. Think of, say, Shemp Howard crossed with Jimmy Cagney at his most Irish, and then magnify that picture. Yeesh.  You really have to throw away any notions you might have about subtlety or realism here - not that that's a bad idea generally when watching genre films of this era.  But DESTINATION MOON requires a few more allowances than many others, I guess.

But the color photography by Lionel Lindon is absolutely beautiful, the background work by space artist Chesley Bonesteel is wonderful, the effects are tops for the period, and it's quite something for a smaller company like Eagle-Lion when you think about it, to put out the first color space picture. And the ending problem-solving climax, typical for Heinlein and a lot of the 'hard' science fiction in magazines at the time, is pretty cool.  So although I'd probably in a pinch pick ROCKETSHIP X-M as the more exciting and involving of these two early space expedition films, I don't think this one is far behind, and they are both must-sees for anyone really interested in exploring the early history of the genre.  The Image DVD still looks ok for being a decade old now; it'd be nice to see an upgrade with some extras, but I'm not holding my breath.",1303603200,,2974,5.140786749482402

The print has good color and is clear but it shows wear and tear.
I think it is worth the $7.00 I spent to see what they were doing back in the 50's.
I can see things in this film that have been used in laters films so its influence is great.
In the Star Trek episode ""The Naked Time"" there is a song that is sung about Christine and it is played in this film on harmonica so I think that is an homage.
The animation used to explain things at one point with Woody Woopecker is used in Jurasic Park so I know Speilberg is a fan.  Those are two things off hand.",1303084800,,803,3.7455621301775146

the wires when they did the moon leap, but so what}  And there could of been a Moon Monster or two to make it more

The answer lies in the question. Back when Destination Moon was made the whole idea of space travel was new. And Destination Moon wasn't a quickie B movie looking to make a fast buck either, it was a well thought out, scientific, forward looking adventure film with special effects that looked ahead to 2001 - A Space Odyssey and beyond.

The DVD of Destination Moon was mastered from a print (or prints) of the film in less than stellar condition.  But the colors remain fairly vibrant and the sharpness is adequate even for viewing on a large projection system.

769421,5,630401323X,"DESTINATION MOON (1950) 5Oth anniversary edition.
Filmed in ""TECHNICOLOR"" , as it was the 1st full color sci-fi space film.
Directed by George Pal , came out  a week after ""ROCKETSHIP X-M"", but ""DESTINATION MOON"" is so technically superior you would swear these 2 films were a decade apart.
The premise of the movie is 4 men in a rocketship dubbed ""LUNA"", built by private manufacturers at the prodding of the U.S goverment. The U.S concerns are whoever controls the moon controls earth, and the U.S certainly does not want that to be RUSSIA. The goverment will reimburse the private companies but cannot accept the possibility of failure themselves in the public eye.
A nice Woody Woodpecker cartoon short in the movie did a pretty good job of explaining the theory of rocket propulsion to a group of potential private investors and of course to the movie audience. (Reminds you of Jurrasic Park where they have a cartoon explaining the theory of DNA )
Our 4 heroes have to take off in ""Luna"" quickly, because of the evergrowing public sentiment and a forthcoming court order due to the fearful consequences of the atomic propulsion engine. Just before they can be served with the court order to stop their flight , they take off for the moon.
The movie sets are very slick, showing space equipment with all its dials, meters and various doo hickeys. You have to remember this is 19 years before man actually lands on the moon. It seems a lot of thought went into making this movie as technically accurate as was possible at the time. Demostrates the forces of G force and weightlessness on the body.
Most of the moon sets were painted backdrops ( as in other George Pal films). The close-up scenes of the moonwalking outside the ship were great for the time. The far off shots of the moon walking were not so great, as it was rather bad stop-action special effects with clay models that looked like well...clay models. The colorful space suits were pretty neat and actually looked like what was worn 19 years later.
The final credits roll ""This Is The End....Of The Beginning ""
The only complaint I have is that the transfer to DVD is not of high quality , sometimes it is scratchy with some static, sometimes the color appears washed out.
You cannot go wrong in purchasing this DVD, it is the best of the best when it comes to the classic sc-fi space exploration films of the 1950's.",1269907200,2,2386,4.640661938534279

Destination Moon is one of the very few films I can name made prior to the Apollo program that tried to envision realistically how a flight to the moon would come about, and this alone makes it almost worth recommending: nothing about the film is exceptionally well done but neither are there any real problems with it, so if the movie sounds interesting check it out.

I also bought it because I finally read Heinlein's story about how the movie was made.  I was genuinely surprised at the quality of nearly every aspect of the movie.  Even my son, who gets nose-bleeds if he watches anything in which George Lucas was not involved, sat through the whole thing, and recommended it to his sci-fi fan buddies.

This was definitely a departure from the typical bug-eyed monster and ray-gun ridden, Martian Princess infested, bad miniature modeled, poorly lit, clumsily acted movies, unburdened by storyline or plot that were so rampant in the 1950's.

I enjoyed the movie as I do very light reading, and it was pleasure to see an early Heinlein story put to film.

This was also considered a fairly big-budget movie for that time for those to whom it matters.

It's cheap and fun to watch.",1255046400,,934,4.763975155279503

Even though this film is based loosely on ""Rocket Ship Galileo"", a 1947 novel by Robert A. Heinlen  he had lots of help with by Rip Van Ronkel - Writer (screenplay).

He who controls the moon controls the earth. So it is vitally important that the free world gets the control first. To do this we must take baby steps to get there. Naturally Our Government will not put out the money or man power. According to the premise of the picture, the government is not capable of doing anything and will have to ask the industrial complex to create their weapons. Unfortunately if we wait for the government to ask then it will be too late.

There are may hurtles to pas from public apathy to government restrictions. This rocket launch must be now or never.  The crew of course is select from a hand full of the only qualified scientists and generals. To round off the crew is Joe Sweeney (Dick Wesson) the local dufus added for comic relief, as if they needed comic relief. Joe is sure the rocket will never get off the ground. What do you think?

If it does then the question is will they ever make it back?

Based on Rocket Ship Galileo, a 1947 novel by Robert A.

Produced by George Pal, entrepreneurship has stepped up to the launching pad to finance a craft to land on the Moon due to the Soviet Union picking up the pace and appearing as if its technological advantage will be enough to get there first.

The U.S. spaceship gets built and is launched from New Mexico with four astronauts aboard. But triumph may turn to tragedy after the travelers arrive on the Moon, so American ingenuity is needed to facilitate a plan to get the ship back to Earth. But the clock is ticking fast and there is no room for error.

The winner of an Academy Award for Visual Effects, the classic Sci-Fi film accurately predicts actual scenarios that played out in the space race during the Cold War and beyond.

769584,4,630401323X,"After the end of the Second World War, America was ready to enter the Space Age with a hard earned sense of realism.  Hollywood instinctively recognized this by beginning with a pair of films in 1950 that were released two weeks apart.  ROCKETSHIP X-M was your typical shoot-em-up oater transported to Mars.  DESTINATION MOON, however, was a serious and realistic look at what the future of space travel might entail. Director Irving Pichel used best-selling science fiction Grandmaster Robert Heinlein to co-author a script based on his immensely successful ROCKETSHIP GALILEO to present to America an outer space film that avoided Bug Eyed Monsters and Pretty Girls in Distress.  Leaving out these twin attention grabbers was a risk, but Pichel's intuition paid off.  DESTINATION MOON is very much a straight line drama of what this country needed do to get a manned spaceship to fly to the moon and to return safely.  Even the much satirized Woody Woodpecker interlude of the basics of space flight was an integral part since in real life President Eisenhower saw a very similar animation that convinced him to sponsor America's nascent space program.

Given the technology of the day, the special effects of the ship, outer space, and the moon are still pretty impressive even to those who are thoroughly used to enhanced CGI.  The acting is uniformly of high order.  Warner Anderson and Tom Powers stand out as does Dick Wesson, who begins what was for him the first in a long stretch of character parts as the Brooklyn born comic who uses a ""dem and dose"" vernacular.  Part of the plot is nonsense of course. Slightly irritating is when Pichel allows a process server to almost ruin the takeoff by serving a ""desist"" order that forbids the launch. Later, the moon journey takes a near tragic turn as the crew must decide how to decide to return home when fuel is in short supply.  Will one of the crew stay behind so the others may leave? DESTINATION MOON is ultimately an uplifting movie that suggests that the greatest obstacle in humanity's path to Reach the Stars is not mechanical at all, but rather an inability to retain its inner core of goodness and conscience during moments of crisis. This film reassures us that these latter twin traits will never go out of style.",1234051200,,2282,4.810741687979539

So these guys secretly build a nuclear rocket and attempt to get it launched to the Moon before the half-wit Luddites try to put a stop to it (and you can throw in some fellow-traveler-Commie-rat-pinkos while you are at it). This movie is steely-eyed stuff....not much humor. Oh, we have Woody Woodpecker (yes, Woody Woodpecker) doing his best to educate us about space travel without boring us to death. Let's just say a little seltzer water down the space-pants would have helped. Even Dick Wesson, a pretty funny guy, can't go too crazy in this one...but he does act as a pretty good audience-surrogate; even taking a decent dramatic turn, which left me thinking how much he resembled Humphrey Bogart.

769591,4,630401323X,"There is no question that this great old movie is revered by the sci-fi fans, hard science buffs and space enthusiasts of the 1950's.  George Pal did a very competent job of presenting a technical story plausibly while trying to impart some (very 50's) human interest along with the technical tale. As noted by one of the previous writers, a better quality print should have been used to make this anniversary DVD edition.  However, the transfer is more than adequate and very enjoyable for real fans of the film.

The movie had excellent special effects for the 50's, a wonderful musical score by Leith Stevens, beautiful space art by Chesley Bonestell, and of course, a beautiful nuclear powered rocket design which remains a classic beauty to this day. The design of the ship LUNA was based on that of the German V-2 rocket, which was beautifully streamlined and made no aerodynamic compromises for easy producibility.

There is only one scene in which this 50's sci-fi movie special effects continues to excite the ""engineer"" in me. When the ship, LUNA, is turned round to aim her landing rocket at the surface of the moon this caught my attention as looking very realistic and exciting.  Many sci-fi films have tried to represent that maneuver and for my money this was the only one that looked entirely credible.

Definitely not a slice of life movie, DESTINATION MOON portrayed the first flight to the Moon very factually. Stanley Kubrick asked sci-fi writer Arthur Clarke to screen some of the best science fiction films with him while preparing him for the production of 2001. Clarke made a point of showing him DESTINATION MOON, noting that it was one of his all time favorites.

Kubrick was astounded with Clarke's heart felt praise and very emotional response to the movie. As I recall, the article noted that Kubrick felt here was this absolutely brilliant award winning writer (who was also a scientist by training, had won academic honors, been recognized as the father of the communication satellite, and helped work on ground approach radar during WW2) getting very emotional over what Kubrick believed to be just an adequate 50's movie.

We all know what Clarke and Kubrick went on to do in the next decade, and science fiction films have never been the same since. Of course, there is only one Stanley Kubrick, and only one Arthur C. Clarke.",1202860800,3,2360,4.853233830845771

Heinlein preserved some integrity in the script and some of the techniques (such as the rocket ship cabin mounted on gimbals) are still in use today. There is in fact only one scene where the special effects are poor--no CGI then. You know that most of it was filmed on the sound stage, but you will look past that.

Picture quality is not the best (it may have been a laser disc transfer of a second rate copy of the film). Several of the actors are solid B movie regulars--the face is familiar but I can't recall the name types--competent but not top notch.

The film tries for some accuracy (no bug eyed monsters or flaming meteors.) Set paintings were by Chesley Bonestell who was both a top Hollywood artist and the man whose paintings of objects in space in Life Magazine and in many books space brought the modern age home to many households.

It is not a bad flick or a silly one, your kids and you can watch it together. I kind of liked the Woody Woodpecker cartoon. It might be elementary but in 1950 (and perhaps today) many people had no idea how a rocket differed from an airplane.",1199059200,,1201,4.352678571428571

769734,3,630401323X,"This is generally regarded as one of the films that started the modern Sci-fi tradition in Hollywood.  There had been previous Sci-fi films made in the previous few decades in Hollywood, but these were all terrestrial in nature.  Even METROPOLIS and THINGS TO COME were earth-bound.  The one exception had been a number of space opera serials made in the thirties and forties, most famously Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon.

What set DESTINATION MOON apart from the serials was the intent of producer George Pal to make a film that was as scientifically plausible as possible.  On one level the film attempts to answer the question, If one were to attempt to go to the moon and back, precisely how would you do it?  And the answer the film gives is essentially correct.  Obviously, the film gets a few details wrong.  The project leaders state that it would be impossible for the government to undertake such a project, whereas in fact only the government was so capable.  They also failed to foresee the role that disposable components would play in the moon mission.  But roughly speaking what is depicted in the film is roughly what happened.  Contrast this with previous efforts to depict moon travel in film, such as in the Melies film in which travelers reach the moon by riding inside a massive cannon shell.

This also a striking movie to look at.  Pal attempted to make the design of both the ship and the moon look as beautiful as possible while staying within the realm of how it all was in fact presumed to look.  Much attention was paid to rather mundane details, such as how someone would get from the top of a rocket down to the surface of the moon.  Unfortunately, most of the films of the fifties and sixties paid only a fraction of the attention to scientific plausibility that this film did, so that this film was probably not surpassed until 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  That serves as a major indictment of the Hollywood Sci-fi film of the fifties and sixties.  Instead of DESTINATION MOON, most fifties and sixties Sci-fi was far more influenced by Howard Hawks's THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE.  The creature picture dominated the Sci-fi film, with serious film about space travel put aside.  In fact, most of the space travel films of the decade were in fact creature films in disguise, since the space travel just seemed to be an excuse to encounter outer space monsters, such as in THE ANGRY RED PLANET.

While the film is quite interesting to look at and the science as solid as was possible at the time, dramatically the film is a huge disappointment.  The characters are all stock characters.  The four main guys are vaguely familiar, having worked in Hollywood as character actors for years, the best known being Tom Powers, who is perhaps best known for playing the murder victim (and Barbara Stanwyck's husband) in DOUBLE INDEMNITY.  There is little in the way of dramatic tension and whenever the film strays from questions about how things are done on a purely practical level it gets a little dull.  What dramatic tension there is seems to exist as a way of holding together the practical questions of how space travel would take place.  One cares about how the mission will be carries out, but not about the fate of any of the characters.

This was the first of a string important Sci-fi films with which George Pal would be associated.  In many ways these remain some of the finest Sci-fi films made before Stanley Kubrick raised the stakes with 2001.  After DESTINATION MOON, Pal would produce such classics as WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, WAR OF THE WORLDS, CONQUEST OF SPACE, and THE TIME MACHINE.  Pal was always trying to test and expand the limits of what could be done visually in film.  He truly was one of the pioneers of modern Sci-fi.",1158364800,5,3762,4.673252279635259

769739,4,630401323X,"""Destination Moon"" (1950 - 92 minutes), a classic of the 50's Sci-Fi movies, was produced by George Pal and was directed by Irving Pichel from the script of Alford Van Ronkel which was based on a novel of Robert Heinlen. The main actors are John Archer, Warner Anderson and Tom Powers. The plot is the following: the North American government develops a project under the command of general Thayer (Powers) to send a nuclear propulsion rocket to the Moon. To materialize this project is necessary the participation of the private initiative. For this, general Thayer contacts Jim Barnes (Archer), owner of the ""Barnes Aircraft"", and asks him to convince other industrials to participate of the enterprise. His main argument is that several other nations are also in this space race and the future of the United States will depend on to be the first ones to arrive at the Moon, therefore ""Who first arrives in the Moon will control Earth"". Based in ""Rocket Ship Galileo"", novel of Heinlein, this film is the first Sci-Fi that gives emphasis to the scientific side of Science Fiction stories. There are no aliens nor lost civilizations on the Moon. The film shows an ""educational"" video clip presented by the ""Woody Woodypeeker"" that is a special attraction. Robert Heinlein was born in 1907 in Butler, interior of the Missouri State, but lived most part of his childhood in Kansas City, among his seven brothers. In 1925 he went to university and later on to the Naval Academy, graduating in 1929. He served the Navy for five years as a lieutenant on board of a destroyer. He was relieved because he contracted tuberculosis, the first of a series of illnesses that would follow his life. After leaving the Navy he attended a Physics and Mathematics course in UCLA, University of California. During the Second World War he was detached by the Navy (even relieved) to work in an experimental flight laboratory. This laboratory was in Philadelphia and was the same where Isaac Asimov worked. Heinlein was one of the first writers of science fiction that lived exclusively of his work. He is considered one of the three great writers of Sci-Fi (together with Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke) and gained four Hugo Prizes during his career. The Hugo is the most important prize of science fiction literature.

769740,4,630401323X,"In some respects, this is an incredible achievement. The science is real and first rate. Based upon what was known when the film was made, this one gets everything right. That is to be expected with a technical advisor like Robert A. Heinlein. In fact, the film is based very loosely on Heinlein's story, ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"".

Where the film falls down is in story. The story is not up to the standards of the Heinlein standard. The story of the film seems to be nothing more than a vehicle for teaching some elementary physics.

The story is one of some civilian scientists in private industry who want to achieve a landing on the moon. They are driven to this goal because the government, for political reasons, is not pursuing the goal. Some people, including a cashiered general, see the need for an American presence in space. He who controls the moon and earth orbit controls the earth because there is no defense which can be mounted against missiles from that end of the gravity well. The civilians make it against all odds but face a variety of technical problems which make their return problematical. The whole production is filled with cold war ideals.

769741,4,630401323X,"Oh, I know it was serious enough in its day (1950). Robert Heinlein wrote the script, George Pal directed it and presumably directed the special effects, and the Academy gave it an Oscar for those effects.

It's just a little hard to take straight-facedly today, though. There's a long interlude early on explaining how a rocket works, in the form of a Woody Woodpecker cartoon. The reverential attitude towards American Industry (you can even heard the capital letters when the phrase is spoken) died long before Ernon and the rest defiled its corpse. The guys bounding around on the moon look pretty naive by the standard of The Matrix's wire-work. Even the stereotypes, like the little wise-cracking guy with the Bronxoid accept, have passed away.

It's fun, though. It captures the era in which it was made, including an glowing optimistic sense that's since been painted over with many coats of cynicism. And, if you have kids, you might appreciate the fact that people watch their language, keep their clothes on, and don't fight each other.

769823,3,630401323X,"More historical curiosity than entertaining science fiction film, ""Destination Moon"" is a must see for those interested in the evolution of the genre and the political climate of the early cold war years. Don't expect any cheap thrills or exploitation elements. There are no aliens, no monsters, and no hot women. Instead it presents a detailed speculation of what they thought it would be like to go to the moon in a rocket-ship. Despite looking like a massive version of a Von Braun rocket from WWII, the speculation about the problems faced by the engineers and crew of such a product are surprisingly accurate and must have been fascinating viewing back in 1950. Both the rocket and the moon are considerably more realistic than the old ""Flash Gordon"" stuff.

Like another science fiction classic ""Them"", ""Destination Moon"" is loaded with political references conveying a not so subtle distrust of the federal government. But the two films convey the same message from polar opposite perspectives. ""Them"" placed the blame for its giant mutations on reckless atomic bomb testing and portrayed the federal response to the crisis as clueless until assisted by local law enforcement and an eccentric university scientist. ""Destination Moon"" has a hawkish perspective, with unidentified fifth columnists sabotaging America's early space program. Fortunately, selfless patriotic industrialists come to the rescue and finance a successful private enterprise program to claim the moon for the United States.

The deliberately low-key documentary style is relieved by the last minute addition of space novice Joe Sweeney (Dick Wesson) to the crew. With a Brooklyn accent (his first view of earth from space elicits a desire to know who is pitching for the Dodgers that day) Sweeney provides both comic relief and an excuse for the expect members of the crew to expound in layman's terms about the details of space travel. I couldn't help thinking of ""Dark Star's"" Sgt. Pinback whenever Sweeney began to whine about not belonging on the mission.

Another concession to the unsophisticated 1950's audience has the project leaders making their pitch for financing through a special Woody Woodpecker space training film. The skeptical fowl and his two audiences receive their indoctrination at the same time. ""Destination Moon"" must have infused the nation with a sense of wonder and faith in what the free enterprise system could achieve because it is actually listed as an event in NASA's chronology of the history of space travel. It is likely that the producers were more successful with this upbeat message than with their attempt to spread fear and promote a space race. Although considerable effort is made to sell the audience on the military value of the moon nothing very convincing is presented in that regard. Ironically, much of the actual space race a few years later would have a military purpose.

""Destination Moon"" has two moments of suspense. The first is when Charles Cargraves (played by Warner Anderson) exits the ship in space and drifts away once his magnetic boots lose contact with the ship. Since Cargraves is the ship's designer, it seems rather implausible that he should forget this but no more so than his constructing the ship out of heavy steel. The second is when they botch the landing and must lighten the ship to have enough fuel to return to earth (of course we 21st century viewers knew the thing was too heavy as soon as we learned about the magnetic boot thing).

Science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein teamed with producer George Pal to put ""Destination Moon"" into production. They soon learned that Kurt Neumann was working to release ""Rocketship X-M"" in time to benefit from their publicity campaign. For legal reasons Neumann modified his more sensational film to feature a landing on Mars rather than on the moon. Although Neumann's paid less attention to scientific details, it turned out to be more accurate in the use of a two-stage rocket and not the one-stage monster featured in the Heinlein/Pal version. Both films were subject to staggering naivet about the complexity of space travel. Although the film's version of the moon surface is hauntingly beautiful (thanks to Chesley Bonestell's backdrop paintings) it looks more like a dried lake-bed than the actual lunar surface.

In retrospect, ""Destination Moon's"" most unique sci-fi genre feature is the absolute refusal of its producers to show anything that deviated from what they believed at the time to be the truth about space travel. Although today it is a struggle to really appreciate the film, at least as it would have hit viewers in 1950, how many science fiction films have been criticized as being too real to be entertaining.

769824,3,630401323X,"""Destination Moon"" premiered in New York on June 27th, 1950, and was put in wide release on August 1st, 1950.  It is one of the movies which started the sci-fi craze of the 1950's. Directed by Irving Pichel, and produced by George Pal, it was based loosely on Robert Heinlein's 1947 Novel ""Rocketship Galileo"".  Heinlein teamed up with Alford Van Ronkel and James O'Hanlon to produce the screenplay for this film. It differs from many of the 50's movies in that it is not intended as the future or the result of some unusual event, but rather as what could be done at the time if an effort was made to travel to the Moon.

The writers did a remarkably accurate job of predicting how such a trip could be accomplished, and what the conditions would be like on the trip. From the g-force of liftoff, to space sickness, to a space walk where one of the crew becomes separated from the ship, to conditions on the Moon, they depicted each of these events very well for the most part, especially considering the limitations of special effects in that era.

The weakness of the movie would be in the first part of the film, where they are trying to educate the audience as to how space travel would work. It comes off as being rather forced, even though they tried some different methods such as a Woody Woodpecker cartoon for part of it.  That cartoon would later be updated and used by NASA to help educate the public about space travel.  Other forced parts of the story include public relations trying to stop them, girlfriends left behind, and the question of sabotage. In addition, the character of Joe Sweeney who is there for comic relief is a bit overplayed at times.

This movie did win the Oscar for Best Special Effects (Lee Zavitz), and in 2001 it was awarded the Retro Hugo for best Dramatic Presentation for the year 1950.  It was also nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration, Color (Ernst Fegt and George Sawley), and nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Score (Leith Stevens).  There was a publicity campaign during the production of this film to raise public awareness about it.  This publicity resulted in producer Robert L. Lippert rushing his low budget movie ""Rocketship X-M"" into production in order to beat ""Destination Moon"" into the theaters, which it did when it was released on June 2nd, a few weeks before the premier of this movie.

This 50th Anniversary Edition is the only version that I have seen, so I cannot comment on how it looks compared to other prints, however, it clearly is worn from the years. It is not in horrible shape, but it would be nice if there were a better copy of it available.  The DVD itself has little in the way of features.  There is no menu even, the only feature being the trailer which shows at the end of the movie.  There are no subtitles, nor is there a feature about the movie and times in which it was made.  One would think that the 50th anniversary edition of a movie like this would have contained at least that much.

One last comment is that the notes on the back of the box indicate that they are continued in the insert, but my copies insert had no continuation of the comments. It merely had the chapter titles for the movie.

769830,5,630401323X,"""Destination Moon"" was the first major science fiction film produced in the United States and is credited with providing the genre with a realism that it had previously lacked.  Based on Robert Heinlein's novel ""Rocketship Galileo,"" this 1950 film does a pretty good job of working out the science for a trip for the moon, 19 years before it actually happened.  Compare ""Destination Moon"" to the low budget ""Rocketship X-M,"" which ws rushed into production by Robert L. Lippert to beat George Pal's movie to the theaters by three weeks, and you can see why it is this movie that is the most important American science fiction film before ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Granted, with ""Destination Moon"" the historical impact greatly outweighs the artistic merits of the film, but that is really the only way this film gets a fifth star.

Heinlein's original 1947 novel was about a group of boys who build a rocket and travel to the moon, helped by a mentor who was an engineer (just like the author).  Producer Pal optioned the story and insisted on a script that would be as scientifically accurate as possible.  Heinlein worked with writers Rip Van Ronkel (""Destination Space,"" ""The Bamboo Saucer"") and James O'Hanlon (""The Harvey Girls,"" ""Conquest of Space"") and they put together a script that represented up to the moment thinking as to how to get a man on the Moon.

Charles Cargraves (Warner Anderson) is a rocket engineer whose final test launch of an experimental rocket ends with the ship crashing.  Convinced his rocket ship was sabotaged, Cargraves seeks private funding for a new rocket that will use a nuclear reactor for propulsion.  Investors are shown a cartoon where Woody Woodpecker provides the basics of rocketeering, and it is pointed out that whoever controls the moon will be able to launch missiles against whoever they want.  General Thayer (Tom Powers) and Jim Barnes (John Archer) becomes Cargraves' key partners, but as the date for the launch approaches the bureaucratic red tape increases substantially.  So the group decides to launch at the next opportunity, which happens to be in 17 hours (fortunately they have this giant computer to help them with their last minute calculations).  Along as radio operator is Joe Sweeney (Dick Wesson), who provides a modicum of comic relief as the guy from Brooklyn who does not believe the rocket will ever get off the ground let alone to the moon.

The part of the film where they rocket ship is constructed is interesting enough, and the whole idea of sabotage, red tape, and wives left behind are minor distractions.  The main part of ""Destination Moon"" is the trip to the moon where such things as a space launch, a space walk, and walking on the moon are all presented with an impressive scientific accuracy via some nice old-fashioned wire-work.  From the time the space ship takes off the movie becomes rather fascinating, so it is clear the second half is a lot stronger than the first and you just have to make yourself sit through it to get to the good stuff.

The film won the 1951 Oscar for Lee Zavtiz's Special Effects, while the Art Direction-Set Decoration (Color) of Ernst Fegt and George Sawley received a nomination.  The panoramic view of the lunar scenery was a massive painting by astronomy artist Chesley Bonestell.  Again, this is not an argument that ""Destination Moon"" is the best science fiction film of the 1950s, an honor that probably goes to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""Forbidden Planet"" (although it is well known I have a warm spot in my heart for ""The Thing From Another World""), but this is a film that is as historically important as Georges Mlis' 1902 ""Le Voyage dans la lune,"" and a lot more accurate from a scientific standpoint.  Of course, producer George Pal would go on to make other landmark films in the science fiction genre, including ""When Worlds Collide,"" ""The Time Machine,"" and ""War of the Worlds,"" but it is ""Destination Moon"" that stands out as the grandfather of American science fiction films.",1105660800,3,4021,4.835276967930029
769831,3,630401323X,"""Destination Moon"" was an ambitious effort on an ordinary studio budget to present a realistic portrayal of lunar flight -- at least from the point of view of the very late 1940s, when the film was begun.

The plot starts out well enough, but by the end becomes almost cartoon-like, complete with the requisite ordinary Joe from Brooklyn named, well, Joe. The technical look of the spacecraft is the usual collection of analog dials and switches, the pressure suits are in a range of pastels with clunky helmets and, well you know. On the one hand I want to allow leeway in my assessment, considering the half-century old vintage of the film. On the other hand, though, consider ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" in production at roughly the same time. That film displayed a far more imaginative view of technical evolution and a more thought provoking plot.

Still, as a piece of history ""Destination Moon"" is worthwhile. Robert Heinlein was involved in the screenplay. Well known space artist Chesley Bonestall painted the astronomical and lunar backdrops. Woody Woodpecker is used to explain space travel concepts to a group of industrialists. (NASA itself would employ the services of Mr. Woodpecker as PR spokes-, um, bird about a dozen years later and would refer to ""Destination Moon"" in its timeline of events leading to Apollo 11.)

769941,5,630401323X,"Destination Moon was the first major technicolor motion picture produced in the United States dealing with a trip to the moon, and the first serious, big budget science fiction film. Robert A. Heinlein (author of Starship Troopers, The Puppet Masters, Stranger in A Strange Land, and Space Cadet) co-wrote the screenplay very loosely from his 1947 novel Rocketship Galileo, although about all that remains unchanged in the film is the name Dr. Cargraves. In the book there is a veiled threat from unknown enemies that turn out to be Nazis (this was the first thing Heinlein wrote after the war) - in the film there's just a veiled reference to a communist threat. I suspect the film also draws from Heinlein's more sophisticated treatment from the same period, The Man Who Sold The Moon.  The film's suspenseful and scientifically accurate plot depicts man's first voyage to and landing on the Moon, and the dangers of outer space travel. A Woody Woodpecker cartoon is included to demonstrate the principles of rocketry.

George Pal's first science fiction film (earlier he had done Puppetoons and The Great Rupert), Destination Moon earned an Academy Award for Special Effects. Later Mr. Pal would produce more science fiction classics including When World's Collide, War Of The Worlds, and The Time Machine.  Photographed in  Technicolor with an original musical score by Leith Stevens and stunning artwork by Chesley Bonestell, Destination Moon is a milestone in special effects and a classic in the science fiction genre.

It is said that this film was shown to President Eisenhower to persuade him to support the pre-NASA space programs. On 6 October 1988, after the Robert Heinlein's death, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awarded him the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal:

""In recognition of his meritorious service to the Nation and mankind in advocating and promoting the exploration of space. Through dozens of superbly written novels and essays and his epoch-making movie Destination Moon, he helped inspire the Nation to take its first step into space and onto the Moon. Even after his death, his books live on as testimony to a man of purpose and vision, a man dedicated to encouraging others to dream, explore and achieve."" -- James C.

However, the film's large budget (for its time), high class special effects, and attempt at realistically portraying a trip to the moon put this film in a class by itself. Perhaps the single most important factor in making this a milestone film was simply the timing. Released some eight years before the official start of the space age, this film was a training film for future space scientists, aerospace engineers (I was one), and astronauts.
Looking back, the film's mistakes are among its most interesting features: 1) the moon's surface is cracked by ubiquitous deep fissures (can't be, because there never was any water); 2) ship is powered by atomic energy (turned out to be too hard and too dangerous); 3) communication with earth is sporadic and primitive (during the Apollo missions, TV was everywhere); 4) no rocket staging (the Apollo vehicle had many stages which were discarded along the way; presumably atomic power made this obsolete); 5) no computers used for control (computers were probably seen as to big and heavy to put in a spaceship).
Suspense and drama are provided when it is discovered the ship is too heavy to return (this is solved). Humor is provided by the kid from Brooklyn. Unusual for a Hollywood movie is the absence of a love interest (Fritz Lang's movie did not resist this temptation). Another interesting aspect of the film was the palpable cold war paranoia.

769945,5,630401323X,"The 1950 film Destination Moon, written by Rip Van Ronkel and Robert Heinlein, is incredible for it's accuracy of what was to come 19 years later. To show rocket physics in simple terms a Woody Woodpecker cartoon is used. Unlike some of the sci-fi films of the era (Ed Wood comes to mind), there is very little cheesy about this (unless you believe what they say about the moon). A small group of scientists have decided to get private US companies to finance the building of the rocketship to the moon. I'm sure they had McCarthy breathing down their necks enough to use this line: ""Whoever gets to the moon first will be able to hit anywhere militarily on Earth and rule the world."" In spite of the meglomaniacal military mentality of this, the rest of the film stays off of this track.
  It's interesting to compare this with the actual Apollo missions. First they show the weightlessness pretty accurately with decent weightless FXs, and when they walk on the spacecraft and someone drifts away they utilize something the first Galileo spacewalkers didn't even think of; using an oxygen tank as a jet to maneuver (after the first spacewalkers found it too difficult without them the spacewalk jets were later used). They ate bananas and coffee (as opposed to tang and baby food), and they never showed how they used the bathroom (in Apollo it was with great difficulty).
  And the idea to land the rocket whole on the moon was the original concept of Apollo until the main designer found it was much easier to create a Lunar Module. The FX of Earth from space was pretty accurate even if the colors weren't quite right, and most striking was how the moon looked in this film. Check it against the Apollo footage and you'll know they were accurate. I mean in 1950 they did have telescopes powerful enough to see the lunar surface up close and they utilized this. And most impressive is the science, being accurate with the airlocks, 1/6th gravity, and even the crisis where they must lower the payload.
  And compare the words of what the 2 astronauts who first step onto the lunar surface tell the world via radio: ""First impression is one of utter barrenness and desolation...most intensely brilliant stars anyone ever dreamed of"". Buzz Aldrin said ""Magnificent desolation."" And ""I claim possession for the United States for the benefit of all mankind."" Neil Armstrong planted the American flag and said the mankind bit.
  Remember this was all theoretical and a decade before anyone had even entered space. The stars I guess is what turns people off here, as they are too bright and looked more like lightbulbs. I guess the technology wasn't good enough back then to use actual star footage, but even on the Star Trek TOS intro they use fake stars.
  And considering all the B films about space travel since (the one with James Caan in '68, The Stowaway in '74, Capricorn One '79, Mission to Mars '99), this stands out for it's being dead on in many ways, even using 4 astronauts (opposed to 3). I'm wondering if the Apollo planners took some cues from this film.
  No, it's no 2001: Space Odyssey, but it's great for 1950. And one other point: they even predict the Space Shuttle, as the rocket is designed to ""glide to a landing"". I'm wondering when mankind will once again venture to the Moon, establish a moonbase, then onto Mars and beyond. We have the technology now, so let's do it!",1064534400,9,3395,4.668341708542713

However, the quality of this as a DVD is pretty poor.
I realize this movie is 53 years old, but no effort was made to clean up the print for the supposed ""50th Anniversary Edition"", as it says on the box.  This was apparently transfered from a VHS copy, or even an old set of reels.
Every time there is a reel change, you get those obnoxious reel change dots in the upper right corner.  There is static, a lot of pops, a few jumps in scenes, the funniest being a scene where the captain says ""let's get into our bunks"", they get half-way there, and BOOM they're in their bunks, finishing off a sentence.  Also, after each reel change, the film is scratched for the next few seconds.
The only ""special feature"" is the theatrical trailer at the very end of the movie.
Since demand for this movie will probably not force a better version, this will probably be your only chance to get this classic movie on DVD.
I do recommend the movie, but be aware of the quality before you buy it.",1054080000,39,1032,4.255102040816326

Its scratchy, its noisy in places and scenes are shortened by a few seconds where broken film has been joined etc. etc. etc. (Its painful to watch sometimes). Come on the guys at IMAGE Entertainment; if your going to put out a DVD of a movie like this; (especially for its 50th Anniversary); at least get a GOOD QUALITY print!!!! Perhaps even get a NEW one made from the original negatives IF possible. I pulled my 15 year old BETAMAX video; (yes it still works!);  from the archives and it looks 100% BETTER then the DVD version you have supplied!!!!! So be warned fans of this George Pal Movie; its a GREAT film, but Image Entertainment have decided to supply you, the customer, with an inferior quality product.

770034,4,630401323X,"Looking at this film today, you might not believe this, but when it first came out, ""Destination Moon"" was at the cutting edge of both special effects and believability.  In 1950, very few people believed space  travel was possible, much less a trip to the moon.  That was kids' stuff,  fantasy nonsense that couldn't possibly work.  Yet this movie got almost  all of the scientific details right, thanks to the influence and  supervision of screenwriter Robert Heinlein, then in the prime of his life  and writing ability.  Heinlein was even then the most respected science  fiction writer on the planet (with the possible exception of H.G. Wells);  in the last fifty years, that hasn't changed.  ""Destination Moon""  is based VERY loosely on his classic juvenile ""Rocket Ship  Galileo,"" but between the two of them, a generation of young men and  women were inspired to believe that going to the moon could be the greatest  adventure of them all!  This film is going to be attractive primarily to  Heinlein and early science fiction movie fans; today, the plot and dialogue  is a trifle corny, and we've seen the real thing.  But think how bad it  could have been: the producers wanted to turn the thing into a musical, and  have the astronauts meet dancing and singing girls on the moon!  Don't  laugh too much: there is reportedly an existing screenplay to that effect  in Heinlein's archives!  Overall, a great slice of science fiction history,  and a must-have video for all Heinlein fans.",964569600,11,1494,4.848605577689243

I'm sure some of the engineering aspects of the movie  were inaccurate.  Anyway, there are no monsters or space aliens here;  rather the story deals with a group of men who want to reach the moon and  the obstacles they encounter.  Unlike many space movies, ""Destination  Moon"" accurately depicts the weighlessness of space and other dangers.  The addition of Dick Wesson in this movie is somewhat peculiar; I guess  the producers wanted to liven things up a bit.

The effects are  good (exceptional for its day) and although the acting is nothing to write  home about, it is servicable.  Follow the crew on their first trip, and  find out who gets left behind when they discover they don't have enough  fuel to get everyone home.  If you want a classic Sci-Fi from the golden  age then this (along with Forbidden Planet and Them) are for you.

As for the movie itself, this one's a  classic, if not for any other reason than its historical importance.  This  is one of the first ""serious"" science fiction films of the 1950s  and was written by the great sf author Robert Heinlein.  The story revolves  around four astronauts, their trip to the moon, and the difficulties they  encounter preparing for the return trip to Earth.  While certain details  are inaccurate, the movie is still enjoyable, overall, for today's  audience.  The lunar landscape is still impressive.

But what is amazing is without aliens, monoliths, R2D2s, they could make convincing sci-fi film to heighten the motivation that U.S. will send men on the moon faster than any countries. And it truly did, though not the way Woody Woodpecker described in the PR animation cartoon. When you also see the film ""2001"", you will notice how the film special-effects had evolved in just in two decades.
