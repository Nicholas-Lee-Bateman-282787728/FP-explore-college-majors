She has truly reached her breaking point to continue believing true love will come for her. However, it's definitely worth the wait when you finally meet the one you love who can finally love you back. You won't regret it. every episode gets better and better and better. Also, this is a tv series that will provide ecouragement for anyone who has set a timeline on finding true love or life's goals, and because it hasn't happend yet, begin to lose hope that it will ever come true. Hang in there! True love and a wonderful life awaits you. Just keep on believing and wait for it to happend. But, in the meantime, watch this series! You will not be sorry!
