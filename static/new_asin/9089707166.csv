1172937,4,9089707166,I really enjoy these morning walks. I only have a small tramboline/rebounder and it works great.  I wish that they would have placed a minute-second timer in one of the corners to see my progress.  It works well for beginners and is not too stressful.,1405209600,,251,4.555555555555555
1172938,5,9089707166,"I had no idea how beautiful Singapore was.  I love walking through the gardens at night and by the ocean during the day.  It feels pretty much like I am actually there.  If you like the ocean and bay, you will definitely like these dvds.",1400544000,4,237,4.222222222222222
1172939,4,9089707166,"It is nice to have a distraction and something scenic to look at while on the treadmill.  It encourages me to walk or run for longer distances that I normally would have.  I like the content of the Virtual Active videos better.  I have the Virtual Active - Sea to sky hike and really love that one.  It is a plus, however, that these Virtual Walks videos have 3 different walks on them instead of just one.",1395878400,5,406,4.233766233766234
1172940,4,9089707166,"I really like the DVD but, the screen changes (like a page turning) every couple of minutes are annoying to me. I thought that it was going to follow the same path continuously for at least 20 minutes.",1394668800,28,201,4.315789473684211
1172941,5,9089707166,This is my sixth video that I have bought.  They just keep getting better and better..  I think this one is my favorite.. The sights and sounds are great and it is so relaxing..,1386374400,10,177,4.176470588235294

7901475,5,9089707166,"I bought the DVD for my exercise machine. At first I was a little skeptical as to whether the speed would fit for a bike. But all three videos are really appropriate. While driving through Singapore East Coast Park, you can relax. Especially the lighting in this video is very nice. But also the other two videos are really good. One time you drive through a park, then on the promenade along the beach with a magnificent view of Singapore skyline. You can always hear sounds of nature, which fit to the videos really well. Exercising at home is a lot more fun with this DVD. I tried the DVD for my trampoline, walking on it is also excellent. Also for people who just start exercising at home, the DVD is really good, just watch and relax and exercising will get fun.",1428364800,,768,4.415492957746479
7901476,5,9089707166,Another great treadmill video. I own several of them and each one has it's own charm. I enjoy walking and jogging to my favorite music while watching these videos. Oftentimes I can almost imagine myself there. Need a few more for my treadmill library cause jogging in rainy Washington sucks.,1424217600,2,291,4.84

7901480,5,9089707166,"This DVD truly helps pass the time.  I get so caught up in the scenery.  I wish there wasn't as much page turning at some points, but overall a really great DVD for treadmilling.",1410912000,,178,4.205882352941177
7901481,5,9089707166,Good for older people trying to get their walks in.,1409788800,,51,4.2
7901482,5,9089707166,"Really nice daytime walks around parks / water's edge in Singapore!  I use it with my mini InMotion elliptical trainer or if my legs are too tired from that, I just jog in place.  The pace is like a brisk walk / light jog.  It would suit a stationary bike too. No music, but nature sounds from the area.  Great production quality!  I have purchased several more, which I will review separately.  Thanks for a fantastic product!!!",1408492800,3,429,4.5064935064935066
