3868063,5,B0027P9NNQ,"Sarah's Happy Yoga Chair yoga is awesome!  I have physical limitations and her videos have enabled me to do yoga again.  I love that I can do standing postures like down dog, warrior poses and triangle pose with the aid of the chair.  Her voice is so calm and soothing.  My husband is in the other room when I do yoga and he said just listening from the other room, her voice makes him feel so relaxed.  I bought VOLUMNS one through three and I love them all!  I plan to ask for another one for Mothers Day.  Doing yoga with Sarah is the favorite part of my day.  I use them every single day.",1427673600,12,592,4.086956521739131
3868064,5,B0027P9NNQ,"These  dvds are great, I have the vol. 1 and 2 and I love them, each routine in the dvd, is 30 minutes long, but your not going to lose a minute of it, that is moving and breathing all the time, after you finish, you feel that your whole body worked hard, and at the same time very relaxed, You have 2 routines of 30 minutes in each dvd, you can choose to do one or both for a challenging workout. Al the routines are so differet, so you never get bored. Like I said before I love this dvd. I'll buy all the series from her.",1272412800,,524,3.8518518518518516

3868097,2,B0027P9NNQ,"Although the stretching exercises were fine, I was disappointed by the technical production of this cd... and that is why i gave it a 2 star rating. According to the description on Amazon, I assumed Sarah Starr would be performing amongst a real field of 'moving' sunflowers... rather than a 'mural' of sunflowers, or what appeared to be a mural. The sound didn't seem to be as professionally done as in her other chair yoga videos... which I found to be excellent!",1464652800,,465,4.682926829268292
3868098,1,B0027P9NNQ,Cannot figure out how to get to 2nd video.  says there are 2 but only get one.  threw it out,1462320000,,92,3.55
3868099,5,B0027P9NNQ,"I bought this dvd along with Gentle Chair Yoga by Sarah Starr; and I love this one as well. The background scenery is soothing, calming. Sarah is so quiet, soft voice..she is easy to follow. I don't miss having background music in these dvds of hers. I am enjoying doing chair yoga with Sarah Starr!  I WILL buy more of hers!",1460332800,4,325,4.327868852459017
3868100,3,B0027P9NNQ,"I paid almost twenty dollars for two workouts it could have been shot, edited and given the yoga enthusiast more for the money.  I only bought the one for now and will use it.",1448323200,,175,4.147058823529412
3868101,5,B0027P9NNQ,"Very nice Yoga session in your own home with nature views as an added bonus. I like that Sarah's DVD's aren't labled as ""seniors yoga"". Anyone can do it, as long as you concentrate on the poses. This is a very nice alternative on days when you don't want to get down on the floor and use a mat. It's a good work out, your muscles will feel energized and the breathing work will leave you feeling relaxed and centered through the day. I saw Sarah on PBS, and I was amazed how good that I felt after doing Yoga with her!",1447027200,9,518,4.088235294117647
3868102,4,B0027P9NNQ,Perfect for someone in a chair,1442966400,3,30,4.166666666666667
3868103,5,B0027P9NNQ,"After 'finding' Sarah on PBS recently, I was anxious to have (at least) a few of her DVDs.  Her accessible poses and continuous guidance, with an amazing variety of spectacular natural settings as background, 'elevate' the experience of yoga and allow the participant to reap the benefits of both strength and serenity.  Highly recommended!",1440374400,7,340,5.277777777777778

3868106,5,B0027P9NNQ,"I enjoy yoga but because of multiple medical issues I can no longer do many of the stand alone and/or floor positions.  I watch and then participated in several of Sarah Starr's shows during a recent ""staycation"".  But I leave for work at 6:30 AM and they were on at 6:00 AM.  I was extremely pleased to find here programs on DVD's.  I purchased three and enjoy them tremendously!!",1431993600,8,381,4.478260869565218

8355040,5,B0027P9NNQ,"I love using a chair to do yoga.  Sarah Starr's chair yoga series is perfect esp if you are just started working out, have balance difficulties, etc.  I have osteoporosis and arthritis.  I feel so much better after working out with this DVD,  I love the locations and sounds of nature.  Very relaxing.",1468713600,3,301,4.60377358490566
8355041,5,B0027P9NNQ,"I came across Happy Yoga on TV by chance one morning while flipping through the channels.  It was an episode from Volume 1 - in the sunflower garden - and was so beautiful and relaxing I ran to Amazon to see if it were available on DVD.  I'm so glad it was!  I'm new to yoga, and wanted something that wasn't labeled for ""Seniors"" that gave me some support so I could learn poses and breathing without falling on my nose.  Happy Yoga's Chair Yoga is just perfect for me!  I love having the variety of one seated and one chair-supported episode in each of the five volumes - good value for the money!  Sarah Starr's voice is clear and calming, and the settings are amazing.  The filming is very well done.  I've ordered three so far, and plan to complete my set with the other two volumes soon!",1464912000,5,793,4.275167785234899
