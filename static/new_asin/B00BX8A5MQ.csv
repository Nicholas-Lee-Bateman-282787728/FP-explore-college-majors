8574976,5,B00BX8A5MQ,As a long time fan of OMD I thought this was an excellent concert well produced with very good sound.,1384473600,,101,4.1
8574977,5,B00BX8A5MQ,"Awesome DVD - great pictures, songs & sound!  If you are an OMD fan, this is definitely worth the money!",1381708800,,104,4.2
8574978,5,B00BX8A5MQ,"I already own ""Architecture Morality & More"" on DVD, and didn't hesitate to purchase it on Blu-ray when it was released. The video and audio are excellent. It was an amazing performance from a band that at the time had just recently gotten back together after almost 20 years apart. These shows kickstarted a whole new OMD generation of music. The band has been touring and writing new music since then. This is one of the best music disks I own. 5+ stars.",1374710400,,456,4.506024096385542
8574979,5,B00BX8A5MQ,"I used to really like OMD back in the day. Architecture and Morality is certainly my favorite album from them, so for them to perform it in it's entirety is brilliant.
Watching them play the whole album reminds me how special and how ahead of their time they were. The rest of the tracks after are a ""best of"" in terms of singles/hits. About the only track missing was ""Secret"", but all the rest make up for it. (see track list)
This bluray is what a live hi definition concert should look like and sound like. Crystal clear image, great sound, good extra features including interview with the band.

I can't imagine Andy Mucclusly being in any more top form than here. Great voice, confident, charismatic, and full of energy at this show. And all the keyboard playing is LIVE. Paul Humphreys and the other fellow play everything live, from all the melodic parts to the simple bass lines......this is unheard of in recent electronic music ""performances"".

These guys are pioneers...and I have total respect for this ""comeback"" show. How they were able to perform at this level after 15 years is truly something special to see.
Long  live OMD!",1372982400,6,1142,4.7
8574980,5,B00BX8A5MQ,"When I pre-ordered this Blu-ray disc there was no reviews yet so I don't know what to expect.  Good thing it exceeded my expectations.  The video quality is excellent but the audio is superb. I played the HD-DTS MA audio option of the disc on my Yamaha Aventage RX-A2000 receiver with the Bowers and Wilkins 685 fronts, HTM 62 centre, 686 surround, Paradigm Atom front presence and the Velodyne DLS 3750R subwoofer.  I was amazed how clean and clear the audio was especially liked the mixing of the surrounds.  It felt like you are in a concert and not just watching it on TV. The bass was solid and tight and not boomy. Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys voices are clear and they sounded the same if not better when they last played at the Rose Bowl Gradens in 1988.  Malcolm Holmes drum performance was great and the best sound I heard in all of my concert Blu-ray collections. I wished they included the song ""Secret"" in this blu-ray so that I don't have to use the CD anymore to hear it.  Great job Eagle Rock Entertainment. For the OMD fans this is a must buy.  Highly recommended.",1368748800,4,1086,4.454545454545454
8574981,5,B00BX8A5MQ,"I pre-order this Blu Ray disc, without reading any reviews, so when i saw the one just posted the other day with 2 stars, i thought i made a mistake. I cracked open the disc, and it sounded good to me. I have the Sony BDVN790W Home Theater, and it sounds good to me.  Picture is excellent too.  Andy's voice sounds great, and so does the band,  they have aged well. If you are a fan you will enjoy. I see that they are on tour this year 2013, and will be in my area in July, i think i will be there!",1368230400,4,499,3.825242718446602
8574982,2,B00BX8A5MQ,Video looks great even at 1080i but what happened to the sound. Everything sound like it was recorded from far away like the mike was in the audience. Don't like it at all. who ever did the mixing didn't do it right.,1367884800,,216,4.166666666666667
