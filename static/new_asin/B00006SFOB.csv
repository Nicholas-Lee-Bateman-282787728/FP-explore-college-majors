1792652,5,B00006SFOB,"Here is a movie that both adults and children can enjoy and even learn from.  To some degree, the Crocodile Hunter movie is much like the Crocodile Hunter television series--Steve and Terri personally introduce us to some of the most misunderstood, wildly beautiful animals on the planet--crocodiles, venomous snakes, monstrous spiders, etc.  The Irwins are basically in the middle of one of their typical outings into nature, rescuing an orphaned little kangaroo, getting snakes off the road and away from the danger of vehicles, and rescuing wild crocodiles who have come into too close contact with humans (actually, it is humans who have invaded crocodile territory).  Interspersed throughout all this, though, the plot of this movie is developed.  A very important little piece of spyware has been lost from an orbiting satellite over Queensland, Australia.  Two competing factions within the CIA (who would have thunk it?) dispatch agents to recover the information at any cost.  Meanwhile, a very disagreeable old woman in the Outback is trying to kill the crocodile threatening her cows; as fate would have it, this particular crocodile has swallowed the spyware the U.S. agents are after.  Luckily, the Irwins come along and rescue the crocodile before the old lady can kill him.  When they find the agents suddenly on their tail, they believe them to be poachers, and they go to great pains to ensure the safety of the long-suffering crocodile by transplanting him into another river system.  The funniest part of the movie, in my opinion, was the conclusions drawn by the CIA about Steve Irwin.  Citing the facts that Irwin had been in South America at the time of two coups, in Kenya at the time of the embassy bombing, and in East Timor soon after its civil war, they consider him to be some kind of dangerous criminal element.
I hope people won't interpret the making of this movie as an attempt by Steve Irwin to go Hollywood.  The only reason the Irwins made this movie was to further increase awareness about the beauty of nature's wild creatures and to encourage any and all efforts at conservation of wildlife.  This movie especially highlighted the dangers poachers continue to present for wildlife everywhere. Any fan of the TV series will certainly enjoy this movie as much as I did, and most likely some new Crocodile Hunters fans will be brought into the fold.  This is certainly a movie parents will have no qualms about letting their children see, as it is more than appropriate for all audiences.  The animals are quite real here, and there were quite real dangers involved in making this movie.  As such, it is as educational as it is entertaining.  The ending is a little weird, but enjoyably so; it is the message and not the plot that is important here. This isn't about Steve Irwin getting rich and famous; it is about saving the animals we share the planet with.",1026432000,9,2895,4.865580448065173
1792653,3,B00006SFOB,"The Crocodile Hunter, the movie!?! When I first heard of this idea, I was not really interested. Oh, I had seen, as I'm pretty sure that you all had, his various shows on TV. Nice part about them is you could flip the channel when Steve got annoying.
I was selected for a preview of this movie. And I would have to give it 3 stars. I know that the hard-core fans will yell at me and the haters of this flick with screw me too, but it's an okay movie.
Here is what I mean by okay: First, Steve hasn't received any acting lessons for the flick so it's just pure old hunter from the show. Second, the plot is thin, spy satelites crashes in Australia, governments trying to get them and Steve doing whatever he can to try and screw with them. Thrid, this is like the TV show with James Bond thrown in.
But enough critics, this is still a decent flick. I feel that where it falls is that it doesn't have wide audience appeal. You know Steve and what he does and if you didn't like the show, you're not going to see the movie. On the other hand, Steve is pretty funny and the work he does in real life (not just molesting animals) setting up zoos and relocating animals so they aren't killed is important.
This movie will rake in a few bucks along with the bad reviews, but on the whole, if you love Steve and his work, go see The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course. If you don't, there a new Halloween flick out.",1026432000,,1407,4.176470588235294
1792654,4,B00006SFOB,"A friend invited me to the sneak preview of the Crocodile Hunter Movie.  I have watched Steve and Terri Irwin for years and jumped at a chance to see it before anyone else.  Those of you who love the Crocodile Hunter on TV will like it as much as.  Those of you who find Steve Irwin annoying, will find him moreso,since he uses his famous catch phrases often!  Granted, a lot of the scenes are taken from their past experiences, like finding the orphaned joey kangaroo, but there are plot scenes that may tickle your fancy.  An inside joke I noticed off the bat was a rather large and...extreme woman who played a farmer.  Her husband died a few years earlier, and when one of the agents goes into the home, you see on the hearth a photo of her and her hesband, who happens to be Wes Manion, Steve's best mate!  There were a couple more jokes at her expense that I will leave to the pleasure of the viewer. About the only thing I had difficulty with was the beginning, when the information probe fell to earth, only to be eaten by the crocodile (the whole reason to the movie. When it hit the ground, it hardly displaced any dirt, and the croc swallowed it down within seconds of the landing.  I would expect something to land from outer space to at least make a crater, and be so hot as to not be able to handle it.  But this is Hollywood!  What amazed me was the fact that what we were watching was real...real crocodiles, snakes, spiders, the whole bit.  And of course Sui stole the show by just being Sui.  All around I found it a stack of fun!  I look forward to seeing it again just to see those sneaky agents get their comeuppance!",1026345600,3,1638,4.262135922330097
1792655,3,B00006SFOB,"Have you ever seen a suicidal nutcase with no will to live?  If not you must not have the Animal Planet channel.  Steve Irwin is the Crocodile Hunter and he has as serious death wish.  This gung-ho nut will go to any length to rescue an animal most people would pay to be killed but you got to respect that.  Anyway they look to make a movie that will be hosted by the croc hunter.
The deal is a spy satilite crashes, a croc eats it and now Steve wants to rescue the croc before the CIA gets a chance to kill it.
I think it is sort of worth it to see this guy say ""Crickey"" when a 30 foot lizard is trying to eat him.  Thats kind of funny.  I like action comedies and just because the croc hunter is so funny I mean he is always this close to death but he always laughs it off and where I would want to shoot the animal that almost killed me but he just wants to save it and that what this movie is all about.
10 to 1 this movie will be a flop but if it does make any money the producer doesn't need a big cut since its produced by none other then Bruce Willis.  Don't look for the croc hunter to become the next Detective Mclane but don't look for this movie to bomb like Hudson Hawk (if you don't know what I'm talking about type it in and you'll see the one Willis movie you never heard of but its not that bad).  Like the Hudson Hawk look for this to be mediocre and will probably open in the ten spot in the top ten.
Its not that bad but its not that good.  If the kids are bugging you because they have alreay seen Lilo and Stich and Like Mike I say give it a shot.  If you are a fan of the series or you just want to get out of the heat, eat some popcorn, and watch your fellow man almost get killed for two hours I say go for it.  BUT if you wan an adult movie you can talk about three words:
ROAD
TO
PERDITION!",1026259200,4,1819,3.8111702127659575
1792717,5,B00006SFOB,"...Steve Irwin rocketed into fame with his wide eyed, hyper, enthusiasm. Everyone loved him after watching just a few of his shows. The Australian accent, his infectious, boundless energy, not to mention his expertise, all combined to create a winning combination...And the crazy guy would PICK UP ANYTHING! In Australia, EVERYTHING is either poisonous, has huge teeth, or a stinger, some even have all of the above. Mostly every insect, mammal, marsupial, or some creature in between is lethal in one way or another. So, it is no wonder everyone who knew Steve was a fan. He would PICK up a snake by the tail and while dancing around avoiding being bit, he would excitedly tell in GREAT detail just about how it's lethal poison could easily kill an elephant, but at the same time ALWAYS telling a story of wildlife conservation. Or he and a few of his ""mates"" would dog pile on top of a huge crocodile (that would make the bravest of us all quell with fear) for relocation. The mystery of these terrifying animals became less so, as he taught us to understand them. He taught us knowledge and respect, instead of just being viscerally terrified. As we got to know Steve, and his wife Terry, you just couldn't help but love them.
  THIS WHOLE MOVIE THING BEGINS WITH A HUNGRY CROC.
  A huge crocodile swallows a piece of high tech weaponry. The global powers rush to intercept their lost toy, when in comes The Crocodile Hunter....That's why this movie was so funny! It was like watching the Irwins do their normal show (if you can call a thousand pounds of teeth, NORMAL) They find the Crocodile (thats eaten a war head) and completely unaware of the crocs recent diet,  Steve fears that this huge croc will not be able to avoid poachers much longer. So, in Steve's usual manner, he begins a relocation. The movie is full of hair raising danger, chases, armed men in helicopters and boats. While all of these ""bad guys"" chase them everywhere! Steve and Terri think that the government goons are just a bunch of poachers trying to score big with the giant croc. Steve and Terri keep the commentary up with the camera the whole time! It's really funny. When the huge pet tarantula climbs up that guys shoulder...well let's just say that a Normal day for the Crocodile hunters is way too much for the goons. Watch this. It's a bit painful for me because I was a huge fan. I would grab a piece of rope or hose lying on the ground, and I would jump about and do my best imitation of Steve, yelling ""Kriky!! as I acted like an idiot. It was funny...

Steve Irwin died doing what he loved. In a freak accident, a frightened RAY stung Steve. The RAY's poisonous barbed spine ended up piercing his heart. The whole world mourned with Terri, and little Bindi. Terri disappeared from the eye of the camera. Little Bindi grew up to be a beautiful young lady, with the same ""hyper, wide eyed enthusiasm"" as her father. I'm serious...the tragedy still breaks my heart.",1472774400,,2955,4.587121212121212

At 6 years old, she spends entire days on pbskids.com, learning about animals and playing games which teach her about animals and the environment.  She's really into this, so I decided to look up The Crocodile Hunter for her and found this.  She thought it was great!  It's not the most sophisticated movie to come out of Hollywood this decade, and it's more ""staged"" than Steve's other ""Croc Hunter"" nature show episodes, but it filled the time and did what it was supposed to do, which was entertain my little girl.",1464393600,,606,4.635514018691588

1792875,5,B00006SFOB,"This VHS was released in 2002 at the height of Steve and Terri Irwin's careers. It is in color,has a running time of 1 HR 25 Mins and is of excellent sound and picture quality. Steve was born in Essendon,Australia on 22 Feb 1962. He died at Bett Reef,Australia on Sep 4 2006,at the all too young age of only 44. He was killed when a Stingray punctured his heart and he bled to death. It is believed to be the only time a Stringray was ever caught on film causing the death of a person. The Irwin family has requested that the film be destroyed and never shown to the public. Terri ,born in Oregon in 1992,had visited Steve's Nature park on a visit to Australia. She fell in love with Steve immediately and they married 4 months later. She was not present when Steve was killed.
 This is an excellent film ,filled with the passion and excitement we all enjoyed and marvelled at in his TV Shows.
 Some reviewers did not give the movie much praise;but that criticism should be dismissed by any who enjoyed the amazing things Steve and Terri showed what could be done with the world's most dangerous and venomous animals.
My only thought being was that the business of the Government 's attempt to retrieve a space object,was far fetched and added nothing to the movie. Well,maybe the gun-toting, Lady Rancher and her her pack of dogs were interesting. Even there,I am sure Steve would have been able to deal with her and her dogs as easily as crocdiles. But the scene where Steve lassos the wheel of a low flying ultraweight aircraft,was totally out of keeping with the adventures of Steve and Terri.

1792962,3,B00006SFOB,"The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course: 5/10: Okay first lets forget the movie for a minute. I mean the film is okay if you like the Crocodile Hunter and you have no business seeing it if you don't. The DVD extras however are brilliant.

For example they show, over years mind you, Steve Irwin and his misses Terri training their star crocodiles to attack a boat without eating the cast. Needless to say the training doesn't really work.

So we have wonderful footage of a barely mobile Steve complete with a knee bandage almost being chomped by a couple of over sized crocs that are some naughty shielas indeed. Now all lot of this footage makes the movie proper gussied up for whatever plot point is at hand. But it is the raw footage that shows how no CGI or mechanical crocs were used. It also covers the endless training to get the crocs used to the sets and cameras.

The crocs successfully, after a while, do ignore the cameras and lights but never their chief tormentor Steve. The crocs act all calm then as soon as action is shouted they go for Steve's jugular like they were starring in a Faces of Death video. The amount of work involved for such a relatively lightweight film is rather awe inspiring.

The film itself is rather simple. Steve and his wife find various Australian wildlife each more deadly than the last. Wildlife tries to kill Steve. Steve yells crikey. There is also an easily ignorable plot about the CIA or something that makes Kangaroo Jack look like a Charlie Kaufman film.

And a warning to impressionable baby boomers, there is a desecration of Elton John's Crocodile Rock by the Baha Men. The DVD even includes a horrible video of same in case you capture some terrorists and need them to talk quick.

One last note. For no discernible reason the aspect ratio changes when Steve is on screen and when Steve is off screen. So if you're like me and A: You weren't paying enough attention before the film. B: You have a wide screen television. C: Your remote is an all in one affair that could land a Space Shuttle and has become a sentient being. Well needless to say according to witnesses my attempts to ""correct"" this were pretty funny to watch.",1256428800,3,2182,4.553571428571429

This movie can be watched without worrying about bad language or indecency, and instead can be educational and entertaining at the same time. This is a movie by one of the world's most well-known personalities, yet a celebrity without the associated problems of alcoholism, drugs, marital unfaithfulness, inability to follow laws, or any other vice or self-promotion exhibited by most other celebrities*. He put the majority of his money back into conservation and his zoo (in order to promote interest in conservation), he worked hard to promote his message with the last 4 years of his life in pain from all the injuries from his personal hands-on approach, never shunning hard work or danger, cared nothing about fashion or trying to look good, shunned the luxury life with the exception of promotional tours (on wildlife expeditions, he refused using a caravan, opting instead to rough it with his team), was a loving father and husband, and often told his coworkers how proud he was of them and how much he loved them--an all around good bloke.  Please support him and his message and the Wildlife Warriors by educating your children and yourselves with this great video.

*After 10 years of public life, the only thing detractors could come up with is Steve feeding a croc while holding his baby boy.  Keep in mind, this is a man who studied them and handled them for 30+ years at the time of this incident. The incident was made to look worse due to a bad camera angle, and the croc was already tired out before Steve's approach with his baby. Crocodilians have limited energy reserves, and the best place to be if in proximity to one (besides the rear) is directly in front, as their striking power is lightning fast from side to side.  Also the croc in question was a large one, the large ones having much less forward speed on land due to bulk than a smaller more agile one.  Steve was in control, and many factors were in his favor, but these facts are seldom mentioned.",1188777600,3,2200,4.71875

I thought it was amusing and held my attention at best.

It wasn't just the result of fangirl bias - I rarely watch the Crocodile Hunter and barely knew anything about him before I saw the movie.  Perhaps it seems good because my expectations were low, but I really think it also succeeds on it's own in a few ways.

Except for Irwin's message about conservation, there is nothing that could be taken seriously about Collision Course, but that is it's strength.  The plot is hokey, the comedy low-brow, and there were one or two stunts in there that nearly made me laugh at how fake they looked; and as for the acting, well - honestly, Steve was one of the most engaging of the bunch, and he wasn't even trying!

But I knew I was going to like this movie in the first few minutes.  A capsule containing highly sensitive, top-secret information falls from an American space satellite to a waterhole in Australia, where a croc immediately finds it and swallows it whole.  When two CIA agents, in a scene that's played quite seriously, are sent to retrieve said capsule, one of them expresses relief that Australia is a ""friendly country"".  That's very obvious code for ""crazy and dangerous hijinks shall ensue once we get there"".  There was a self-aware silliness to all of it that made me grin.  It's childish, but it sure is fun to watch.

The Irwins' encounters with real, dangerous creatures were fascinating as well, more so because very little of it seemed staged; they delivered the only genuine suspense.  The downside to these Croc-hunting scenarios is how much they distract from the plot, but that may also be a good thing.

The left side of my brain wants to give this a lower rating, but ultimately I can only judge a movie by how much I enjoyed it.  And I did enjoy this one!",1168473600,2,1789,4.55

He left behind his wife Terri Irwin, and his wife Terri Irwin, his daughter Blondi, and his son Robert. The movie begins with the CIA finding out that a precious spy satellite, has landed in an Australian bush. They send out agents Archer (Kenneth Ransom) and Wheeler (Lachy Hulme), and thier mission is to capture baseball-sized beacon, that is filled with infomation that must not end up in the wrong hands. You might even wonder if they know about the Irwins at all, for most of the movie. They are piarted with Australian native Jo Buckley (Kate Beahan). Steve Irwin and his wife Terri are off doing thier usual aventures, which is collecting snakes, examining lizard poo, and rescuing orphaned animals. While crocodile is decimating feisty rancher Brozzie Drewitt's (Magda Szubanski) cattle, and local Fauna and Fisheries ranger Sam Flynn (David Wenham), and they hire the Irwins to relocate the beast before someone gets hurt. And while this is going on, the CIA agents evantally meets up with the Irwin, whom Steve mistakes for hunters. While Steve does mention his father at times, in the movie, his parents nor his young daughter (at the time) are seen in this movie, so you have to wonder who was watching Blondi, you might guess his parents, when Steve and Terri were making this movie.",1166918400,,1563,4.666666666666667
1792991,5,B00006SFOB,"Steve Irwin getting his own movie, crikey! (I know, that was lame) Collision Course is based off of the popular wildlife television series the Crocodile Hunter. When Collision Course was released in theaters, it did okay, but not amazing. That always confused me since he was widely known and respected but the movie didn't sit well with critics. The most frequent complaint is that the movie is pretty much just like the television show so there really is no reason for a movie. While yet it is very similar I have to disagree. While the television series is popular, releasing a movie lets many more people get educated about animals and also have some laughs as well. Another frequent complaint is that the CIA agents are unnecessary, they are, but I find them amusing and they make for a good time. One last complaint is that Steve and Terri aren't very good at acting, but you can't really criticize them too harshly, since they aren't really actors but wildlife conservationists. But, let's just ignore the critics and decide for ourselves. And since I'm not a critic, let me say that I loved this movie and if you've enjoyed Steve Irwin's work you'll definitely enjoy this movie. I was relieved that the scenes with Steve and Terri were quite similar to an episode of the Crocodile Hunter. You see, Steve is trying to relocate a crocodile before its shot by a local rancher, and two CIA agents are searching for a missing satellite beacon and they happen to run into each other for entirely different reasons. While yet this is a very unrealistic plot, it's very enjoyable. This movie really doesn't deserve a specific rating so you kind of have to decide for yourself. If you're into well made movies with a great plot and great actors this movie isn't for you, if you love wildlife, Steve Irwin and don't mind a silly plot than this is a great movie for you and I would recommend it.

Not only is the movie great, but the bonus features are fantastic as well. Many of the bonus features discuss the difficulty of filming animals. Since Collision Course is scripted, the film crew needs the animal in the scene to do a specific movement for the film crew to get a shot. But many of the animals in Collision Course are deadly and cannot be trained so it's very interesting seeing the way that Steve and the film crew get the shots they needed. Collision Course also has many deleted scenes, and also included are the movie's original theatrical trailers. The rest of the bonus features aren't as interesting but decent, there is a music video featuring the Baha Men, a photo gallery, and...sigh...DVD games. Oh yes, you can also select a feature called ""pop-up croc track"", this feature lets you read information about the animals and location during the movie. There are also one or two hidden features on the DVD menus if you want to search around for them. They're interesting but very brief.

Steve Irwin may be gone, but his legacy will never be forgotten and the Crocodile Hunter Collision Course is a great item to own to commemorate his unforgettable life.",1165795200,,3071,4.67467652495379

Unfortunately, I was drawn to this film by Steve's untimely passing.  I was hesitant to view it for two reasons.  I didn't want to dislike this film.  I also didn't want to praise this film effusely because of Steve's death.  Fortunately, this is a terrific family film.  The best part of the film is that Steve is an engagingly energetic cheerleader for wildlife.  Not only is Steve witty but he is incredibly knowledgable about the wild kingdom.  I'm not a viewer of the Discovery Channel but I was on the edge of my seat as Steve relates the lifestyles of varied creatures.  Steve's wife, Terri, makes for a fetching sidekick.  The only drawback to the film are lesser stories about the CIA trying to intercept a missing black box in the Outback and a portly female rancher trying to bag a crocodile whose been devouring her livestock.  These story threads, however, are ultimately woven into the story for a satisfying conclusion.  If you have reservations about viewing this film because it may make you sad never fear.

Irwin and wife are oblivious to the fact that this particular prize was swallowed by the crocodile they are trying to relocate to a safer area...before a crazed ranchwoman (Magda Szubinski from BABE) kills it for killing her cows.

1793052,4,B00006SFOB,"The Crocodile Hunter is also known as Steve Irwin. He is famous for his adventures in the wild, as he captures real animals. The best part is that none of it is a computer generated image or anything of the sort. All of the animal action in this movie is real, and that's what makes it fun. The Crocodile Hunter is the animal hunter who is always happy, and always ready for the next adventure. The only difference between his television show and his movie ""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" is that the movie actually has a plot. I feel that the plot killed the story a little bit. It is kind of like the ""Garfield"" movie. ""Garfield"" is about a fat, lazy cat who never seems to want to leave his home. The problem with that movie is that it has a boring plot. The beginning is good because we get a sense of Garfield's lifestyle and regular routines. The highlights of ""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" are the scenes where Steve Irwin is exploring the wildlife, and doing what he does best. Once the storyline kicks in, some of the scenes are stupid a childlike. The could have made a plot similar to the television show, and still have a good adventure story. Irwin makes up for the faults in the movie, because he is always having a good time, and wants us to have a good time watching him. 80% of this movie is fun, while the other 20% could have been changed when it was written. It's a shame this movie didn't make as much money at the box office. It would have probably been better on the big screen, but I missed this one and had to watch it on video.
The story is about a top secret government satellite which has blown up and brought a device that is very important into the Australian outback where it has been swallowed by a crocodile. If the device falls into the wrong hands, it could mean trouble. The CIA has two agents Bob and Vaughan to find the crocodile and get the device back. Another person is plotting to get the device. Their contact Jo has been assigned to get the device, by pretending to be helping them. They don't know how hard it'll be to find the crocodile because of two reasons. The first is the cattle farmer named Brozzie who hates crocodiles and people who go onto her land. The other reason is because of Steve Irwin and his wife Terri. They are a couple devoted to helping the animals. They believe that the government agents are really poachers who want to steal the crododile. They decide to go on a journey to the Austrilian outback, get the crocodile, take it with them, and release it far away and out of danger. The journey is not going to be easy, and the race to the crocodile is on.
""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" may have a lame plot and some lame acting, but it is because of Steve Irwin that makes the movie work. I'm glad that Steve Irwin and his wife are playing themseleves, and not playing people similar to them or something like that. If they ever made a sequal to this movie, they should make it more about the jungle, and something that the Irwins have to do there because of something wrong with the animals instead of throwing in the governement and lame things like that. ""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" came out during the summer, and now that it is summer again, although two years later, it is the perfect family film to rent and watch anytime. It's action packed, full of fun, and should be satisfying to anybody who will give it the time of day.
ENJOY!
Rated PG for action violence/peril and mild language.",1088380800,3,3502,4.414219474497681

1793076,3,B00006SFOB,"I love Steve Irwin's Crocodile Hunter show and completely respect what he does for wildlife, but this movie was really lacking substance. I felt like I was watching outtakes of the Crocodile Hunter. My biggest complaint:  taking a great show and trying to make it into a 90 minute movie. It comes out looking rather absurd because it tries to press this idea that somehow a crocodile in Austrailia is going to eat a intelligence satellite that has fallen from space and that the FBI is going to track the Irwins for withholding classified government information.
I realize that this idea is far-fetched on purpose and only for entertainment value, but still, most of the dialogue seems spoonfed and inane. Personally I think that they should have just taken the show and made a long documentary and released it onto video.
There are several positives to the movie: Steve Irwin and the extras on DVD. Steve Irwin is always fun to watch; his goofy and outlandish wisecracks and antics kept me attentive to the film. Whether he is talking about a deadly venomous spider from Austrailia, running down and trying to catch a lizard to show the audience, or trying to track down a crocodile, he is always entertaining to watch. The DVD gives you some of the extras like behind the scenes footage of the stunts from the movie, a few outtakes, as well as 10 deleted scenes that did not make it into the movie. For this reason, I suggest if you are purchasing this movie to get the DVD over the VHS.",1056585600,3,1489,4.618867924528302

CROCODILE HUNTER has a little bit of something for everyone: action, comedy, suspense, a little bit of romance, guns, a car chase, and lots of wild animals. The violence is tame, there is no sex, and there really isn't any foul language.

The whole technique of meshing a typical Steve documentary into a hackneyed spy thriller became less and less effective as the movie went on. Steve just can't be that unassuming all the time. Though well acted, the character of Brozzie was horribly annoying throughout. We have no sympathy, regardless of what made her the way she was. No dramatic tension ever developed in the movie. We spent most of our time waiting to see the guard dogs kill and eat Ranger Sam. And he was the most likable character in the movie. When a movie just stops and shows uninteresting outtakes as its grand climax, you know it has completely fallen apart. But what did we want from the movie? Steve and Terri spend almost all their time doing their usual thing with the animals, which is why we love to watch them in the first place. In a couple instances, we got subtle reminders that Terri is built like a brick you-know-what. Yowza! Sure, I'm jealous of Steve. This is an amazingly incompetent attempt to cram a fun documentary couple into a theatrical movie. Kids will like it. Croc Hunter fans can tolerate it. But if you're not either of those, just avoid it. In all honesty, the movie really does deserve only one star. But hey, it's Steveo!

1793079,3,B00006SFOB,"With the popularity of his documentaries, its probably inevitable that Hollywood would give Steve ""The Crocodile Hunter"" Irwin his own feature film. I've always enjoyed his TV show, but when I first heard about this movie I immediately thought it would be a surefire bomb. Well, when I finally got around to seeing this I was pleasantly surprised.
The plot centres around a missing satellite beacon being tracked by the CIA. The only problem is that it has landed in Queensland, Australia and one of Irwin's crocs has swallowed it; in addition to trying to locate and save the croc, Steve, his wife Terri and their dog Suey find themselves up against some nasty poachers.
While some may be put off by Steve's non stop gabbing, you can't help but get caught up in his enthusiasm for his work, resulting in a film that is both fun and educational (that's one word I've never used in a review before). There are also some genuine hair raising thrills and chills that make Indiana Jones look like a wimp; although a minor portion of it is obviously choreographed for entertainment value. But this is a great family film. Actually it will appeal to any age group. Keep your eyes peeled for an amusing cameo from President Dubya.",1049846400,2,1223,4.693023255813953

His mother and I told him he would never watch the TV again if he did not tell us where he heard that word. After a great deal of crying and apologizing he said he heard in on the Croc. Hunter movie.

I was wrong. I love Animal Planet's docu-series with the Croc Hunter (It's always amazed me how crazy this fella must be). The movie is filmed half in they style of Steve's tv show, and half in the style of a motion picture. By keeping the real people and the fictional character separate through most of the film, they're able to continue to give the feel of the tv show. And our heroes, Steve and Terri, stay oblivious to the plot of the film throughout. The show is full of cheeky humor (the word ham comes to mind) and cheesey action mixed in with Steve's animal action. It actually turned out to be a pretty good film. I was surprised I liked it. Plus there is all kinds of behind the scenes footage, where we get to watch Steve play with his crocs.

1793139,4,B00006SFOB,"As a sort of low-key action-adventure movie, this was pretty successful. The story was okay, never boring. As for the fictionalized characters, they were kind-of hit-and-miss, sometimes entertaining in a usually humorous way, sometimes just plain silly. The CIA operatives in Australia were ambiguous characters. It was hard to tell what degree of villainry to ascribe to each, which if any could be seen as non-villainous, and hard to completely buy into the movie's way of seeming to resolve those issues in the end. But if you don't care too much about that, their actions and contribution to the story are watchable. The fat rancherwoman was a sometimes hilarious but sometimes stupidly overplayed character, but on the whole a passable contribution to the story. As for Steve and Terri Irwin, they were their usual selves, doing what they do best. It seemed like their adventures were on the whole a bit less authentic than in their TV series, but maybe that's in part because such lack of authenticity is what we so often expect from movies. The one time I thought most strongly I was seeing something I would never expect Steve Irwin to do in real life was when he used the snake he was relocating to scare off the pursuer being dragged behind his truck. That's just not how I would expect him to treat the animals. But then in his regular show I've never seen a time when he had any such need to fend off a human pursuer. His utter naivety to the fact that someone other than poachers was pursuing him and Terri was mostly funny, but began to get a little old.

1793143,2,B00006SFOB,"This minor hit is equal parts silly equal parts stupid.  Created around Discovery Channel sensation Steve Irwin and his wife Terri, it follows their exploits as they face dangerous creatures from across Australia.  These documentary style set-ups are genuinely entertaining, so its really rather a shame that someone decided to introduce a plot involving the government, crocodile hunters and an exploded satellite.
The Irwins, playing themselves, are real personalities and surprisingly perhaps transfer perfectly to the big screen.  The same charisma and unstoppable daredevil activity that keeps you watching on TV is evident here, making the couple the best thing about the picture.  They appear to be mercifully aware of what makes them popular and certainly aren't adverse to a little self-parody, as they wrestle crocodiles or Stevo narrates his one-on-one with the bad guy to a camera whilst ducking punches on top of a moving vehicle.  In fact, theres something so wonderfully endearing and humorous about them that for a minute you believe you're watching a highly entertaining documentary.
For this reason its a shame that a ridiculous plot with a crocodile swallowing something that fell off a satellite (what exactly is never made clear) played out by some cringe-inducing acting.  This is definitely the stupid part, which is not only laughable in a non-ironic way but also dull.  The silly parts though are highly enjoyable, especially with the Irwins on board.",1028419200,4,1476,5.309012875536481
1793144,3,B00006SFOB,"Crikey! Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, here comes the irrepressible Steve Irwin in Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course.
You know Steve Irwin. This is the Aussie naturalist who, as cable TV's popular Crocodile Hunter, rescues endangered critters like spitting cobras, gila monsters, monitor lizards - and of course man-eating crocodiles - from areas of human encroachment and relocates them to more appreciative settings. He has several famous shticks. My favorite is the one where he holds an extravagantly poisonous snake by the tail and cheerfully expounds on its weaponry while the creature struggles to make him a Dead Australian. Irwin's American wife, Terri, abets him in his environmentalist adventures - hauling him back into the boat when a croc tries to give him the ""death roll"", wielding the snake sack, and so on.
In Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, the Irwins play themselves, which is probably a good choice. As wildlife relocators, they are called in to move a particularly large and predatory crocodile from a habitat shared by Queensland farmer Brozzie Drewett (Magda Szubanski, Mrs. Hoggett from Babe) who has been trying unsuccessfully to make a suitcase out of it. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to any of these people, the croc has swallowed up the hard disk from a downed U.S. intelligence satellite, and the CIA has dispatched some clownish operatives to get it back by any means necessary.
Ever since I started seeing promos for this movie, I wondered how the filmmakers were going to find a way to wrap the infotainment-style, straight-into-the-camera Crocodile Hunter format in a fictional, action-adventure storyline. As it turns out, they didn't. The storyline, such as it is, is just a gossamer-thin excuse to move Crocodile Hunter from cable to the Big Screen. The subplots concerning the CIA pinheads and the varmint-shooting widow, and the gonzo conservationist action involving the Croc Hunter, don't manage to intersect until near the denouement - and even then they barely nod at one another in passing. In the meantime, Steve and Terri bag an impressive catch of inappropriately located animals for resettlement, including a venomous spider, a baby kangaroo, and not one but two deadly snakes - just like on their television show.
So why should you pay seven or eight bucks to see on the big screen what you can see for free on Animal Planet? Well, I'm not at all sure you should. That doesn't mean that the movie isn't entertaining, though. Sure, the story, the script, and the acting are inconsequential. (Ms. Szubanski is really the only one who bothers much with line readings.) But Steve Irwin is a genuine phenomenon. It's not just that he nonchalantly pals around with deadly reptiles (though I'd like to see you try it); he brings such an infectious, giddy enthusiasm to the screen that it really energizes you. He gushes over ""beautiful"" monster crocodiles and melon-sized arachnids like they're Victoria's Secret models, and after a while he's got you thinking, ""You know, that lizard really does have kind of nice eyes."" Irwin passionately preaches conservation; but because he's such a nuclear meltdown of gleeful energy, the message doesn't come across as stuffy or smarmy. And when it comes to credibility, who're you going to believe, some Nature Conservancy stiff, or a guy in a bush suit who wrestles thousand pound reptiles for a living?
On the other hand, don't watch Crocodile Hunter (T.V. or movie) thinking it's going to be educational. Irwin's commentary is primarily a stream of lurid factoids or environmentalist generalizations - peppered by cogent observations from his wife like ""This is really dangerous!"" Still, I like the effect the movie had on my four-year-old. As we were walking to the car afterward, he volunteered, ""When I grow up, I'm going to be a crocodile hunter!"" By the time he grows to a more circumspect age, I don't imagine he'll really want to be choke-slamming anacondas (geez, I hope not). But maybe he'll hang onto some of that enthusiasm for nature, and occasionally venture from the air-conditioned confines of the living room or the mall to explore a world that - if Steve Irwin has anything to say about it - will still be verdant and wild.",1028160000,3,4253,5.025495750708215

The need for the FBI and Defense Department and something exploding in space did not make any sense. Like I said there were parts of the movie I could have done without, but the parts with Steve and Terri are great. One of the scenes where Steve is wrestling a croc under the water at night almost made me scared that Steve wasn't going to make it, but of course the hero always lives no matter what.
If you like The Crocodile Hunter tv shows or are an animal lover of sorts you will enjoy this movie. Go to see it once and see for yourself. At the very least it is very entertaining and a break from your everyday life.",1027036800,,1062,4.110576923076923
1793172,5,B00006SFOB,"Ok, so the acting was not Acadamy Award material, but Steve and Terri just make this movie worth the 8 bucks!  Kids will love it, and adults can't help but be entertained.  I'll support any of the Croc Hunter's projects!  A little bit (Ok, a lot!) cheesier than the show, but DEFINITELY not a waste of time or money.  A MUST SEE!",1027036800,,329,4.258064516129032
1793173,5,B00006SFOB,"At frist I thought this movie would be dumb, then after I saw it. I had to see it again. It was great, If your looking for a movie to take your family to then go see the movie. You will enjoy the movie even if you don't have childern too. Also remember that Steve and Terri are giving all their money from the movie back to wildlife. so go see the movie",1026950400,,353,3.8493150684931505
1793174,4,B00006SFOB,"Funny, funny, funny...and not much else. I laughed my asp off. Loads of critters and lots of twitters.  Steve was hot, the plot was not.
Don't expect Academy awards for any of this nonsense and fun. But do expect to laugh out loud (LOL). The story has Steve and his wife trying to save a croc that has swallowed a top-secret piece of space junk. The CIA wants the part and the NRO wants it too. So they send agents to retrieve it. What no one knows is the croc has eaten what the government wants. The Irwins think they are saving the croc from poachers.
I think what we enjoy most about Steve Irwin is his irrespressable attitude. Whether he discovers a Bird Eating Spider or a large pile of croc poo, he is elated, and shows it. ""Woo hoo, look at this mate. A big stinky pile of croc poo!"" With dialogue like this how can the rest of the movie be all that bad?
One scene that made me laugh had Steve and Terry finding a baby kangaroo in the bush. Terry says the baby is cold. Steve tells us that they must get the baby warm. He goes on to tell us that the baby kangaroo is much like a human baby and they must nurse it every two hours. He is telling us this while Terry is behind him removing her shirt. I died laughing. I had no idea where this was going to end. I really don't think the Irwins intended this to play as it did, which made it all the more funny to me. (Pun alert) This scene may have been the ... part of the entire movie.
Go see the movie...and take the kids. P.S. I very much enjoyed the movie redition of Elton John's ""Crocidile Rock."" Be sure to stay through the credits for it.  Cammy Diaz  A @ L",1026864000,5,1620,4.05625
1793175,4,B00006SFOB,"If you've seen all the children's movies/cartoons that are out then you need to go see this one for a nice change of pace.  If you like the Crocodile Hunter on Animal Planet then you'll enjoy Steve Irwin's on-screen antics!
Basically, Steve Irwin is saving and moving a huge croc from an old farm rancher, Rosie, who is trying to kill the croc as it is coming onto her property and killing & eating her cattle.  Rosie is ready to make belts and purses out of the croc, but the australian version of fish & game calls the crocodile hunter to come catch & relocate the croc.  Unbeknownst to Steve, the croc has swallowed a U.S. Satellite camera and the U.S. government is on it's way to kill the croc & retrieve the spy camera.
During this whole time, the crocodile hunter does not know that it is the U.S. government trying to kill the croc (besides Rosie the rancher), he things these bloats are poachers wanted to use the crocs skin for various items.  He doesn't even know what the spy camera is once the croc has pooped it out.
This is a very entertaining, family oriented movie and has quite a few laughs!  I took my 9 year old daughter to the movie opening day and the place was packed with family members of all ages!  And the movie theatre was filled with tons of laughing from the audience.  Plus people were raving about the movie when they were walking out! If you want good family entertainment, go so this movie!",1026604800,6,1424,4.391634980988593
1793176,2,B00006SFOB,"For a Discovery Channel 1/2 hour special this movie filled the bill, but for entertainment this selection missed the target.  It was tough to decifer who the good guys were from the bad guys.  Was the plot conservation of animals or some weak story line about U. S. government security.  My suggestion is to wait until this comes to video and rent it...  Spend your money more wisely like on popcorn.",1026518400,3,400,4.591549295774648

Sure, it's weird and makes no real sense. Sure there's a heavy helping of corny dialogue (by characters other than the late, great Mr. Irwin, I mean, as I'm sure you already expected the typical weird audacious Australian exclamations from him littered among his animal facts), but it has an odd, nonsensical charm to it. I'd recommend watching it at least once in your life. I think it has potential to be a small cult classic amongst Irwin fans anyway. Go for it",1482019200,,667,4.61344537815126
