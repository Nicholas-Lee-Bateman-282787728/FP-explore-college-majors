I have to add this one item.  One reviewer is really upset because of no landings.  Is the simple word 'ASCENT' lost on this person?  This dvd is well worth it's cost and then some.  The cover and it's title are not the least bit deceptive.  You will completely enjoy ASCENT!

8585069,4,B00CQQZSS0,"Fun video for science/space nerds like me. Only minor disappointment was there was no audio of the shuttle itself - just the engineering narration. It would have been nice to have at least one video with audio where you could crank up the surround sound and shake the rafters a bit. Also note that most (or perhaps all) of the videos on here are also available on youtube. Still, I'm a happy customer and am glad I bought it.",1503360000,,425,4.3924050632911396
8585070,5,B00CQQZSS0,This is a truly amazing video footage of the Space Shuttle at different angles during liftoff all in super slow motion! Loved every minute of this ,1484956800,,147,4.653846153846154
8585071,3,B00CQQZSS0,"There are absolutely NO landing videos on this DVD as are indicated in the menu screen capture below the main image on the page. So if you are looking for great landing videos, save your money. There are absolutely NONE on this DVD. I bought it because I needed a good landing film for a project I am doing and unfortunately, I was deceived.

The video itself is interesting, but hardly worth the price for the 45 minutes of film footage. This footage is slowed down considerably with exception to the last 4 minutes of film. It is a nice effort. But for the price, it is extremely disappointing. Buyer beware.",1400284800,,610,4.495495495495495
