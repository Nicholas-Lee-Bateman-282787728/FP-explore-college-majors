8293897,5,B000G1ALUC,Funny but it reminded me of the scam I was caught up in,1428796800,,55,3.3076923076923075
8293898,5,B000G1ALUC,Rented this for my ten year old and he absolutely loved it. Would highly recommend it as a fun family film for parents to get for their kids!,1376265600,,141,4.071428571428571
8293899,5,B000G1ALUC,"A good way to spend a 100 minutes or so. Certainly not to be taken too seriously but the superb acting by some of these kids combined with a fanciful plot won't leaveyou upset about how you spent your time. Emma Kinghorn is going to be a star, see her now.

8293901,1,B000G1ALUC,"1) the movie stars a bunch of kids who quite frankly cannot act.

2) the movie plot revolves around stupid special effects and computer graphics that are the quality of 3D renderings of the 1980s.

3) the plot is simply stupid...if this were to happen in real life, a simple look at the e-mail headers by any IT department head in the country would have solved everything. and not to mention...a power surge will not reverse code instructions for a wire transfer--it will fry your computer.

It was an accident that a company would actually distribute this...",1156032000,2,559,4.742268041237113
