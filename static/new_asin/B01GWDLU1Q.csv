Women are assigned to the gladiators as a treat. Im not an animal. She is Varinia. They show their training with wooden swords. They are taught how to kill, wound, or cripple their opponent. Their training continues. A buyer arrives to inspect the merchandise. They want to buy two pairs who will fight to the death as part of a wedding celebration. They make their selection.

They gather more slaves to their cause. Spartacus meets Varinia. An aristocrat bathes and talks to his slave about the power of Rome. The slaves exercise to prepare for combat. At night Spartacus philosophizes about knowledge. He meets a representative from the Silesians who are enemies of Rome to arrange passage from Rome in seven months for a payment.

He tells Spartacus that Rome is marching against him and predicts who will win the battle. Death is the only freedom a slave knows says Spartacus. Thats why they will win. The Six Cohorts are camped without a stockade. Spartacus attacks at night and wins. The Roman General is sent back to Rome. The Roman Senate questions him. He says only the Legions can defeat Spartacus forces. The freed slaves march south towards their destination. [What about their supplies?] Some die on the march.

The slaves will be crucified along the road to Rome as an example to the others. Crassus converses with Varinia. Later he finds Spartacus and will make him fight as a gladiator, the winner will be crucified (a slow death from thirst, starvation, or suffocation). Gracchus frees Varinia and her son before the soldiers come. She meets Spartacus on the road and says goodbye.

This is at best an average story. Perhaps you should know the history of that era to appreciate this movie. It seems padded out and too talkative. It takes place in 70 BC when the Roman Empire was ascendant. Rome conquered western Europe, the Black Forest of Germany prevented their expansion to the east. In time Rome fell, it decayed like other empires. You can find modern examples in some business corporations.",1487894400,,3742,4.768518518518518
