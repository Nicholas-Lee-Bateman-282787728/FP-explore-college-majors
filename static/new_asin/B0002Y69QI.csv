8034596,3,B0002Y69QI,"Its ok, but it does show that people don't understand what makes a commander. Everyone thinks they can do a better job until they are in charge. This series is a good example of it. Good for starters in Anime.",1381017600,,209,4.25
8034597,5,B0002Y69QI,"The Geisters: An elite fighting force charged with protecting the last vestiges of humanity from the Siliconian creatures, and from Shioru insurgents.

The Dobians: The ruling class on Earth; scientists, politicians and nobles living in massive towers high above Dobias city. Having taken shelter in space during the great steroid impact, they profess to have the best interests of humanity in mind. Others believe that best interest is their own!

The Shioru: Farm dwelling desert nomads who stayed on Earth in the years following the great impact. Now competing for land and resources with Dobias, their future is even more in doubt.

The Siliconians: Mindless silicon-based creatures which have risen from the ashes of a dying planet. Now that Earth is on the mend, they are moving up the food chain.

The Geisters now find themselves used as pawns in a political power struggle between the ruling noble families of Dobias. Their orders questionable; their new equipment dangerous and experimental; and their intelligence information on the enemy highly dubious. The question is not are the Geisters walking into a trap, but rather who's trap are they being ordered into?",1348876800,,1174,5.195767195767195
8034598,3,B0002Y69QI,"Things are starting to get tougher for the Geisters with the plot developments in v. 2, as the team is forced to endure intense training sessions, and survive a deadly ambush.

  We also get to see more of the back story of Chris Vesta and discover her decision to join the military and the House of Juno.  All in all the series is developing fairly well, with enough mystery to keep me interested in continuing on.  The highlight of this volume definitely has to be the cat and mouse chase between Alcion and his ambushers amongst the strange landscape of the ""crystal jungle"".  Again, the fact that this series is very inexpensive compared to other anime titles is a bonus since the producition values might be seen as a little rough by some.

  Hopefully things will continue to improve as the series progresses.",1109376000,2,815,4.643356643356643
