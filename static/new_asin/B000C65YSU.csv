2453797,5,B000C65YSU,"Our 2-year-old daughter loves this video. She asks for it by the name ""Happy Heart Day.""  We like it too.  The stories are well crafted, and -- without being even the slightest bit preachy -- they convey the values of caring, sharing, good manners, committment to family, and other timeless lessons.  Some have objected to the Miss Spider videos because they do not teach the alphabet or counting skills; we would much prefer our child to appreciate the gentle world of the spider family than to become burned out on academics before she gets to kindergarten.",1154822400,,559,4.802083333333333
2453798,5,B000C65YSU,"Everyone at our house (even the adults) loves Miss Spider! The stories, music, and characters are never annoying like many other kids' cartoons. The animation and scenery are amazingly beautiful, just like the books. The only difficulty with the DVDs is that you can't find the contents anywhere online! For those of you who would like to know before you buy, the stories included on ""Happy Heartwood Day"" are 1. Happy Heartwood Day  2. What a Tangled Web  3. Family Tree  4. Snuggle Bugs  5. The Bug Flu  6. No-See-Um Is Believin'!  7. The Thinking Stone  8. Tastebugs

Every story is a real gem, and there's an absolutely hysterical scene involving Bounce (our favorite) in ""Tastebugs"".",1144195200,22,688,4.870689655172414

8096137,5,B000C65YSU,"Im not a TV person so I don't let my kid watch much tv.  I bought this for my toddler who was miserable in his rear facing car seat.  It seemed a lot better than some of the othe programming available.  Well, I LOVE Ms spider.  The stories are sweet with a moral without being preachy.  It's not annoying for me to listen to when we are in the car and my one year old no longer minds car rides as long as his portable DVD player is loaded up with Ms spider.  Quality programming!!",1338076800,,480,4.0

8096139,5,B000C65YSU,"Miss Spider and her family show us how to have fun together while teaching manners and helping young children to understand their own feelings about adoption.  The use of a ""buggy"" family with different bugs to tell an adoption story is less threatening to young children.  Specifically, the Family Tree episode deals with the different feelings that children of the same family can face regarding their adoption story.  After watching this series my own adoptive and birth children have role played the scenes and in listening to their fantasy role playing I've learned what they themselves are currently struggling with from missing birth families, wondering why we don't all look the same and questions that their friends may be asking that they don't know how to answer.  Miss Spider has opened many doors of dialog for us.  If you, or a family your are close to, have adopted or are considering adopting young children this would be a great  addition to your DVD library.",1285372800,,976,4.920731707317073
