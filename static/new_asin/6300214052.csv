247689,4,6300214052,"""Drangonslayer"" is easily in the top five sword and sorcery movies ever made, if not the best next to ""Excalibur,"" a film of similar poetic magic and action. The cinematography is filled with dark,  mysterious landscapes of rising steam,fogs, mists, fire, and strange  sounds, and it does what most great films do: transports one to a different  world. Ralph Richardson, as the wizard, is wonderful, and it was  unfortunately one of his last performances, which adds extra power to his  quirky but great performance. The rest of the actors, save Peter MacNicol,  are English, and for a bit, MacNicol sems a wee bit awkward, but as the  movie progresses,his performance gains strength, as the plot calls for him  to be strong. The pace is somewhat slow but all the better the savor the  magic of the atmosphere; there is a scene in the quiet forest, when you can  here the beat of drangonfly wings. The dragon is only partially glimsed at  first and we want to see more and this is a superb way to build up  suspense, for when we do see the dragon, diving with outstretched wings,  burning a village, it is astonishing. Phil Tippet, master animator, did  most the animation of the dragon and it is easy to see why he was chosen by  Steven Spielberg to help out on ""Jurassic Park."" Take a close  look at the T-Rex and he looks amazingly like the dragon in  ""Dragonslayer."" This is the Dark Ages and many of the key scenes  are properly shot in darkness and through mists. With the final battle with  the dragon, as thrilling as you will ever see, we really appreciate the  power and magesty of this dragon and in another wonderful scene, as  Richardson is shown a dragon scale, he has pity on this dragon, an old and  ancient foe, sad to see the last of its kind. There is also an  appropriately soaring and magical mucic score by Alex North, one of his  last, and one of his best. The movie is somewhat violent and has very  modest nudity and might not set well with some younger viewers, but when I  was younger I loved magical movies like ""Drangonslayer,"" full of  fear, magic, wonderful sights and sounds, and the belief that dragons are  real, fearful presences yes, but dwelling in the hot mists of ancient  caves.""Dragonslayer"" is a magical masterpiece that will last.",958176000,8,2273,4.598503740648379
247690,5,6300214052,"This is an exceptional entry in the fantasy genre.  The castles are cold and dank, with an uncaring King and a brave, beautiful Princess.  The Wizard is mysterious and seemingly harmless, and the apprentice is rash and  stupid, desperate to prove himself. And the Dragon, well the Dragon is a  great beast, old beyond measure and filled with a reptilian evil.
This  is the finest filmed Dragon story that I know of.  All of the characters  manage to live beyond their stereotypes.  The setting is dark and, in it's  own way, quite realistic.  This is a believable fantasy realm,  where  peasants are dirty and iron weapons are heavy.  The story has several  twists and what can only vaguely be called a happy ending.",957484800,6,716,4.715447154471545
247691,5,6300214052,". . . than what has been said by some discerning movie buffs.  Saw this film twice in theater and have owned it on Beta, VHS, and LaserDisc -- now where is the DVD?",956793600,2,164,3.823529411764706
247692,5,6300214052,"Peter McNichol, late of ""Ally McBeal,"" stars as a sorcerer's apprentice who sets out to eliminate a dragon terrorizing a mythical kingdom.  He encounters what has to be the best doggone dragon effect ever.  When the young man finally sees the dragon in all its awesome savagery and  fire-breathing slendor, he, like the audience, is dumbfounded.  This dragon  is one mean you-know-what!
The film, a joint venture between the Disney  and Paramount, shows that the investment was well worth the cost.  Sir  Ralph Richardson is memorable in a small role as the wizard who meets an  early demise but is ""resurrected"" to assist the lad in his quest.  Look for a small role, also, from the actor who would later become the  Emperor in the Star Wars' films.
This is not one that the little ones  should see alone.  Like the fairy and fantasy tales of yore, explanation of  the events as they unfold needs to be done to assure understanding for the  very young.  The PG rating is warranted, but should not be a deterant for  youngsters, just an advisory that the parent should view it with the child.",956448000,,1092,4.663157894736842
247693,5,6300214052,"This is simply a great movie, and I'm surprised it doesn't have a larger following.
Forget DragonHeart, this is the way a dragon movie should be. The Dragon is cold, menacing, and absolutely not human, which was the  biggest flaw with Draco.  His motivations and thoughts were much too  human.
In this movie, the dragon is a bitter old beast, and it works much  better. More than that, the special effects are great even without tons of  CGI and stuff.  The magic is good, the sound and music are good, and while  the acting is pretty awkward, it's not bad. Also, look for the Emperor from  Star Wars as a Christian priest.
Although there's not much competition  for best dragon movie, this one certainly beats the socks off the two  dragonslayer videos.  If you like dragons, or just good fantasy movies,  definately get this one.  It's a true masterpiece.",948240000,5,857,4.671140939597316
247694,5,6300214052,"The acting is great, the special effects are wonderful and the cinematography is superb.  It has a dragon, evil villans, a brash young hero, and a damsel in distress.  It has magic, castles and great scenery.  Does this sound rather typical?  Don't be so quick to judge.  Dragonslayer  has the one thing that so many swords and sorcery  flicks lack:  plot.
Dragonslayer starts as a typical fantasy but there are at least  five points in the story where they take the fairy tale formula and turn it  on its head.  Add the most convincing dragon ever (sorry dragonheart, it  was good but not that good: methods don't matter as long as you have  talent) and you get the best swords and sorcery flick of all time.  Now  with all this can someone tell me why it is not yet available on DVD?",947030400,12,785,4.429577464788732

247838,5,6300214052,"It easily eclipses the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" films, for a reason I'll get to in a moment. It's one of the all-time-great fantasy films, and sorely underappreciated. (Why no Blu-ray?) At the end of the review, I'll discuss to what extent my DVD copy is edited or censored.

One of the reviewers heaps praise on the superb script. It's not surprising, given that the screenwriter is also the director. He strips out every bit of dialog that isn't needed, and the result is terse and elegant -- especially given the outstanding acting. I'm not joking when I say the ""Dragonslayer"" script can stand beside Robert Duvall's for ""The Apostle"". Knowing he'd eventually direct it, he removed everything that wasn't needed (as in ""show us, don't tell us"").

The principal thing that makes ""Dragonslayer"" far superior to the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" films is that it embodies a conflict used in other fantasy stories -- that there was a transitional period between paganism and Christianity, and that pagan practice included real magic, which was gradually displaced by monotheism. Coincidentally, ""Dragonslayer"" sits on the cusp of the transition from Ray Harryhausen's special effects to ILM's.

I can't recommend ""Dragonslayer"" highly enough. The story twists and turns, and never plays out the way you think it should. Be prepared to be surprised and delighted (as well as frightened). You might want to read the reviews on Wikipedia, and judge whether those criticizing the film were reacting to its failure to be what they expected.

The amazing score is by Alex North. It got a well-deserved Oscar nomination. (It lost to ""Raiders"". Rest assured, gentle reader, that North's score is far more imaginative and atmospheric.)

""Dragonslayer"" is dark and violent, and should have been rated PG-13 (which didn't exist in 1981). It has often been toned down to reduce the violence, as well as its sexual elements. A few nights back, ""Movies!"" showed it, spread over almost 2.5 hours, twice the nominal running time of 110 minutes. I found my Pioneer LaserDisk edition, which is probably a direct transfer of a projection print, and thus un-edited. (I won't know until I get a working player.) I then found my DVD. As far as I can tell, it's intact. Other than the wisecrack about Valerian's virginity (which I'm starting to believe I imagined), nothing seems to be missing or altered, including the baby dragons noshing on the princess's leg.

The copyright on the box is 2003 -- but the cover art is not what you see on eBay. It's actually the theatrical poster. Given the excellent image quality (I played it on a $20 refurbished Funai into a budget Hisense 4K display with outstanding up-sampling), It's unlikely you'll see it in better form until Warners gets off its duff and gives us a deluxe BD edition.",1519862400,,2807,4.9113924050632916

The magic in the film is eye catching and the dragon is very credible looking. I can understand why the film isn't as well known since the story isn't as splashy as a number of other more famous fantasy films.

This is about overcoming, and so can be lightly encouraging.  Acting is good, but not wow.  Again, color is not perfect, but is quite adequate for this old movie.

It is an action movie; the evil dragon has a villain's destructive forces in motion against humanity. I would call this movie's genre that of ""fantasy"" because if dragons did exist, most would have been animals with less impressions as being evil creatures. The dragon has been a legend in different regions of the world and in countless literature. There is psychology in the mythology of this movie. The dragon can represent conflictive opposition of any kind. This movie is great for anyone with an interest in the theme of dragons, romance and honor. This movie would make a great opera script.

248343,4,6300214052,Always did like this movie. Amazon pricing gave me reason to finally purchase it for my movie library. I'd been looking to watch the movie before just didn't want to give up the $4-$5 for one time viewing. Since I am one prone to watch a movie over and over depending on my mood the price made this a good buy for me. Four stars since the scene where the guy gets with the girl so she no longer is a virgin is missing from when I first saw this movie. Not cool to be leaving out scenes like that which helps the plot a lot in my opinion of course. Good buy good movie to watch from the past before vampires.,1463788800,,607,3.9836065573770494

248444,3,6300214052,"I always thought of Dragonslayer as more of a theatrical play more than a motion picture movie.  Its not really bad nor is it very good either.  The Dragon is cool and some of the scenes are very well done, but it seemed like you barely get to see the dragon at all during the whole movie.  I kept thinking how cheap the sets looked in some of the scenes.  The acting is actually pretty poor to average for the most part.  The wizard and apprentice were decent.  For whatever reason I always have a hard time getting into this movie.  For a fantasy medieval movie it just seemed to move so slowly.  Many of the characters seem hollow and one dimensional.  Being that it is a Disney film a lot of the action scenes seem to cut away before anything happens.  Endless amounts of talking instead of action in this movie.  I do appreciate the effort put into the dragon it looked very good onscreen and was done years before CGI effects came out.  The music was very bland and uninspiring in this movie as well.  Nothing like the Conan or Krull scores where you remember the music for a long time after seeing the movie.  I would probably rate this 2 1/2 to 3 stars its not terrible just a very slow film that needed more action and less dialog.  I wondered why the towns people did not try and use ballista's or catapults to fight the dragon.  Why not trap the dragon in its den in the cave, there seemed to be a lot of things the director could have tried to make the movie more exciting instead of just using a virgin lottery.",1453248000,,1524,4.2578397212543555

Not really a fan of the front cover in terms of design, I think having the films theatrical poster would of been better instead of having the dragon flying on top and having the main hero on the bottom. It just looks like they took two different screenshots of the movie and photo shopped them together in a very lazy manner. The back of the DVD cover is nice. As far as the menu goes, It has you standard Play, Scene select, and etc. Nothing fancy. As far as the movie goes, It has decent picture quality. The plot for the movie is a bit slow and plays out more like JAWS than you average dark fantasy. Camera work is great since it slowly revival the dragon (again like JAWS). Characters in the movie aren't really that interesting and some of the motivations of some of the characters aren't really explained well or not explained at all. The movie is also has a lot of strange moments in it. The movie is more of a special effects showcase if anything else and Vermithrax (the dragon) in terms of design is great. Also I find it strange that the film is a co-production between Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions while the DVD (at least this edition) is distributed by Warner Home Video.",1447718400,,1233,4.412280701754386

248584,4,6300214052,"So nostalgia isn't an issue for me.  I didn't realize how popular this movie was; I was expecting something low quality and campy and it isn't that.  I'd even say that Dragonslayer tries a bit too hard.

The directing and the vision of the movie really sets it apart from other fantasy films.  But the orchestra was bad.  Background music should not bring attention to itself, and more than once it was a big distraction.  And I really didn't like Peter MacNicol.  I'm not sure if it's him I disliked so much or the overall theme I disliked.  I'll explain more under my spoilers part.  I also didn't like Caitlin Clarke.  At all.  She overly enunciated every word and she's the first person I've ever heard who prononced the 'h' in 'there'.  Thuh-here.  She sounded like a broadway snob and just wasn't right for someone supposedly poor and humble.  She'd make a good governess like Mary Poppins though.

I was blown away by the special effects of the dragon.  Well, I was blown away by some of the effects.  A few scenes had a claymation quality and others had an immobile head spewing fire.  And the dragonlings sucked.  They were like The Rodents of Unusual Size from The Princess Bride.  But the flight of the dragon was very impressive.

spoilers..

Dragonslayer reminded me of Dragonheart.  Dragonheart was a better fantasy film, while I think Dragonslayer was a better movie.  They both had the theme that magic and the old ways are dying and a new age is coming.  But with Dragonheart, there was a sadness to the loss of magic, while in Dragonslayer the old wizard had a friggin' death wish.  I didn't like the vibe that 'magic is dead and good riddance.. now let's bring in two thousand years of Holy Rollers.""  I mean, Draco in Dragonheart.. well I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it, but the dragon in this simply rotted.  Why make a film about dragons and magic if the theme is that magic is best dead and forgotten?  Well, because they also wanted to parallel that with a coming of age film.  That goofy looking apprentice will leave magic and childhood in the past and make babies with a chick who pronounces every letter of every word.  And Part 2 of Dragonslayer will doubtless parallel a midlife crises as the older Peter MacNicol needs to find magic again just to escape the damn house!

I will say that it was strange to watch a higher budget fantasy film and not feel asphyxiated by PC-ness.  For instance, I don't think a  more modern film could get away with sacrificing a virgin because women simply cannot be shown as helpless and in need of rescue anymore.  And I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed there's no black people.. And please don't misunderstand me!!  I think PC-ness is probably overall a good thing for the world, possibly.. but it's absolutely devastating to entertainment.  I wish social crusaders would focus less of their energies on tv and movies and more of their energies on things that actually matter..  I just felt the need to clarify so that people will vote not helpful on my review for the right reasons :)",1441065600,,3064,4.564338235294118

248735,4,6300214052,"This DVD version of an early 80's movie transferred very well into DVD format. Other Disney movies from the same time, such as The Black Hole and Tron, did not. You'll see a little bit of grain but for the most part the movie has a soft, hazy look that's appropriate for an old-time fantasy movie.

Cynics will wonder what's the point of watching Dragonslayer when we now have the glories of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. First, the dragon (Vermithrax, I believe?) is absolutely terrifying no matter how many times you see it. Second, Alex North's symphonic score easily rivals Howard Shore's more brooding soundtrack for the Rings trilogy. Early Stravinsky, Paul Dukas, and possibly Le Six are swirled into a sorcerer's stew of musical wonder. Third, Ralph Richardson is magnificent as the rascally old wizard--a formidable figure in redoubtable old age, and easily a match for Ian McKellan's venerable Gandalf.

The main problems are slack direction and poor writing. Peter MacNichol and Caitlin Clarke make an appealing young couple, but they're always upstaged by their more experienced co-actors. MacNichol's swordfight with one of the King's henchmen is unconvincing to say the least. Clarke's father and the king have both exempted their daughters from the lottery through disguise and subterfuge. The moviemakers ask us to approve of the poor father but to disapprove of the king's similar conduct. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can't hate rich and powerful people for being rich and powerful. Nor can you approve of misconduct among the poor just because they're working-class heroes. My point is that, by the end of the movie, our winning young couple is seeming awfully small and puny against the rest of the drama.

A possible complaint is that the effects--especially in the last 15 minutes, during the climactic showdown between Richardson and the dragon--can't compete with today's CGI. They can't. But I insist you won't find a more terrifying dragon this side of Mordor, nor will you find a more winning sorcerer as played by Ralph Richardson. And don't forget about that Alex North score, either.",1430006400,,2140,5.022535211267606

Corruption is seen within the kingdom as is a sly, supposedly practical, mechanism to appease the beast.

This movie stands out because not only is the story very good the special effects are very well done with the limitations they had back then.  The dragon is one of the better dragons you will see in a film, honestly this dragon is better, in my opinion, than the werms in Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Rivals even smaug.  You can tell the stop motion and string laden flight a little but not bad.  The storyline of the Wizards apprentice wanting to save the people and prove himself by fighting the dragon is told pretty well.  It's hard to span 90 minutes with that type of story but the writers did it exceptionally.  It is a must see by anyone that is a fan of dungeons and dragon type movies.

249100,1,6300214052,"The most redeeming value of this film is probably seeing the development of the go-motion effects of the dragon.  The acting was barely fair and the action scenes were lame.  The main character is given no back story to explain why he is qualified to be the hero of the story and isn't particularly likable.  The romance is just another instance of there being a man and a woman in a movie together so they must fall in love; there is no actual romance or reason behind their love.  The only thing in the movie worth watching is the go-motion effects of the dragon, if you're interested in this aspect of film.

249222,4,6300214052,"I have a hard time getting into the fantasy genre.  I just don't generally gravitate towards these types of films.  I still have not seen the Lord of the Rings films, and Im not sure I ever will.  I stumbled across this the other night and decided to watch it since Ive been watching films from 1981 recently and since it was late and I had nothing else to watch at the time.

One of the major issues I have with films like this is the acting.  I should probably clarify that as over acting.  The trying too hard to be sincere and serious that you come off as stiff and awkward.  That plagues Dragonslayer, especially when it comes to Chloe Salaman, who plays a concerned princess willing to face death for the equality of her people.

Noble, right?

The film tells the story of a young sorcerers apprentice who has to take on the role of dragonslayer when his master dies, leaving him to try and work out the kinks in his talents.  The land is ruled by a savage beast who is devouring young virgins as sacrifice and who is keeping the people in constant fear.  What helps Dragonslayer is the fact that the story is intriguing and is constructed in a way that draws you in and holds your attention.  While the majority of the performances are poor (Excalibur had a similar problem), the action is VERY strong, and the final fight sequence between young Galen and the dragon is well worth the wait.  For an 80s film, the special effects are rather incredible.  You can sense the obvious detachment of some of the effects, but for the most part the creation of the dragon and the action that ensues is really fun and eye catching.

I didn't love this, but I surprisingly liked it quite a bit.",1385337600,2,1690,4.389067524115756

Galen thought he wanted to be a sorcerer, but events proved him wrong, although, at least it did not cost him his life.  This film has a more intricate plot, you have the dragon, the wizard, the mad king, and the aspiring sorcerer.  It is classic good versus evil, but the evil is not just the dragon, the evil is also humanity.  The king's twisted bargain with the dragon, can never suceed, at least for the human side of the deal.  It is interesting to watch the galen character mature as the story moves along.  By the conclusion of the story he has realized that an age is ending, and the life he knew is also finished.  The pricess was courageous and foolish at the same time, her sacrifice solved nothing, the satanic bargain remained in force.  A very enjoyable film, good special effects, and a believable story line.  I'm very happy with this film, and recommend it to others.  JRV",1380844800,4,960,4.434285714285714

Valerian: Are you afraid of dragons?
Ulrich: [confidently and calmly] No. In fact, if it weren't for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any dragons. Once, the skies were dotted with them. Magnificent horned backs, leathern wings... soaring... and their hot-breathed wind. Oh, I know this creature of yours... Vermithrax Pejorative. Look at these scales, these ridges.

But not everybody thinks the dragon can be defeated and not everybody is on the same side.  Great conflict between characters and ideas.  True, the Princess crossed the line from bravery to stupidity near the end of the story but the rest of the flick is great.

And I'm aware it's an 80s flick so I'm not gonna judge the special effects - I actually think they're not so bad considering the time when this was shot. I still cannot recommend this movie. I just did not like the script, particularly Galen's role. [***Spoiler alert***] One minute humble apprentice to a ""big"" wizard, the next minute arrogant and self-confident like no other. Such a big shot that he sees no issue to enter the dragon's lair by himself on his first trip away from his former home. I guess the goal was, somehow, to make Galen seem arrogant at first, learning that this is not the way and then make him humble again. This goal was not achieved during the movie, I truly did not like his character by the end of the movie and, at times, wished the dragon would just get it over with and bite his head off ;-) IMO people like the movie who saw it in the 80s as 16 year olds as this brings back memories or whatever. I guess there are some movies like this where I'd be biased as well.

249509,5,6300214052,"An incredible journey not only back through time but also into the realm of Fantasy. It is the story of Galen, a young and somewhat incompetent wizard's apprentice, Valerian, a young man with a secret, and the last of the Dragons Vermithrax Pejorative. After watching this movie for the first time in the 1980's I could almost believe that the dragon and the kingdom of Urland both existed. In my mind the name Vermithrax came to be associated with dragons every bit as much as the name Smaug had.

Some see Peter MacNichol as an odd choice for this role and back then, having only seen him in The Pirate Movie, I had similar thoughts. But it was a very good choice in the end. Somehow MacNichol brings not only arrogance and foolishness to the character of Galen but a touching vulnerability and in the end the character is all that much more heroic for his flaws. It was an excellent choice for a young apprentice who quickly finds himself not only totally outclassed by the last dragon but has to face up to his lack of power while still trying to make good on his masters (and his own) promises to the villagers.

All that I will say about Caitlin Clark is that she performs the role of Valerian very well. I also remember having a huge crush on her at the time. Another excellent choice for a role in this film.

The dragon Vermithrax Pejorative (""The worm of Thrace who makes things worse"") was one of the best animatronic jobs I have ever seen. This is no man in a cheap rubber suit but an actual animatronic dragon, the story of the creation and realization of the Vermithrax is to long for me to recount here but can be read elsewhere. Vermithrax is simply one of the most impressive, beautifully designed pre-cgi dragons ever, if not the best, period.

The setting - the imaginary post-Roman kingdom of Urland (circa 400 AD) is also brilliant concieved and filmed. The lad feels cold, misty and mysterious. The whole setting feels honest and faithful to the conditions of Dark Ages England.

All in all even though it is over thirty years old this is a movie that truly deserves to be viewed by anyone who enjoy fantasy or even monster movies. It is a classic that doesn't have the fame that it should.",1361836800,2,2212,4.492537313432836

When they finally reveal the dragon in all her glory it is well worth the wait.  Vermithrax is truly a dragon to behold.
Other than that, the plot moves quickly, the dialog is fabulous, especially when spoken by the likes of Ralph Richardson and Sydney Bromley (who play my two favorite characters, Ulrich of Craggenmoor and his servant Hodge).  I was also impressed at how they made the costumes look the time period and not some Hollywood version of the not-so-dark ages.  I still have trouble accepting the music score and I do believe Peter MacNicol was the wrong choice for the hero, but those are my only two disappointments and I have learned to live with them.

There was a good basic story to work with, but the writing/scripting wasn't very good and neither were the actors.  The soundtrack was really amateurish. The music/soundtrack of a movie sets the mood and is a pretty huge part of the movie. It can bring warning, foreboding, fear, excitement, joy, etc.  (Think of Jaws - take away the excellent soundtrack and the movie really loses something).  The camera work leaves much to be desired as well including scenes where the characters appear to be cut/pasted into a scene (green screen work I believe they call it).

There were some decent special effects in this movie for the time, and the dragon was done pretty well (a notch above Godzilla).  But I would NOT recommend this movie.

About 27 minutes into the movie, there is a brief scene in the movie with nudity. It's only about a 1-minute scene and basically PG but you should know it's there.

It's a genuine Magic & Dragon fantasy Genre film with a slightly off-beat un-traditional movie story. And it's a very authentic fantasy film.

It is not a blockbuster type of film though. Its more like a run of the mill young adult fantasy magic novel being brought to life in an excellent film.

The best bits are when there is Magic or the Dragon, and the old Sorceror is top notch. The rest of the plot, while not always so exciting-can seem just abit too pastoral at times - is also interesting and abit quirky. This includes the fading of magic out of the world, at least that or sorcery & dragons, and the new type of magic, that of Christianity, starting to emerge.

Lowlights of the film include one character being gnawed on by the dragon's brood, a brief glimpse of underwater female nudity (I had to shield my 7-year-old's eyes when first showing the family the DVD), and the American accents of the two young leads among the remaining accents of English actors (even reliable American actor Albert Salmi's voice was dubbed to an English accent). All in all, the Disney organization really delivered with Dragonslayer, the kind of story it had plenty of practice telling in decades past, and Walt probably smiled down from the heavens with a gleem in his eye.",1310515200,2,1050,4.801104972375691

The effects hold up surprisingly well, and except for some chroma-key and matting flaws in the climactic aerial battle scene, this movie still looks pretty good.  Audiences nowadays are spoiled by a glut of slick CG effects that look real but are somehow not as IMPRESSIVE as old-fashioned optical effects.  Vermithrax Pejorative (this movie's dragon) looks pretty freakin' awesome when you finally see her.  Filmmakers were a lot more meticulous back in the days when ""we'll fix it in post"" was not an option.  This movie is good because they put a lot of planning & effort into making it right.

The plot is simple, but the story is compelling because the characters are well-portrayed.  Many of the secondary characters had no depth per se, but the actors did a good job of making them convincing nevertheless.  The only character whose motives I question was the big goon, the king's enforcer (he - not the dragon - is the real villain of the story) who continues to be belligerent when it no longer makes sense to do so.  Still, this movie has a certain charm which is lacking in 21st-century productions which focus more on spectacle and less on story.  Even though this was a ""special effects"" movie, it still spent more time establishing characters and setting than similar genre movies do today.  The locations were beautiful, the costume and set details really made me feel like I was seeing medieval England, and the deft camera work helped to create a mood of suspense long before the dragon appeared.

There's a certain satirical undercurrent here which I completely missed when I was younger.  The king is a weaselly opportunistic politician, making decisions based on expedience rather than justice or ""right.""  Another subtext in this film is the disappearance of paganism and the rise of Christianity in Celtic/Norman England.  I was a little surprised to notice in my most recent viewing that Christianity is not presented in an entirely favorable light.  The scene near the end has a hedge priest leading his congregation in a hymn while the king views the dragon's carcass .. I don't want to spoil it, so let me just say it's a bitterly satirical moment that I didn't pick up on as a kid, but as an adult it hits me right between the eyes.

Four stars because it's old and there are some visible technical flaws in that climactic battle scene - but this is a REALLY good movie which should not be passed up by sword & sorcery fantasy fans.",1293926400,3,2718,4.664570230607967

I was into all those fantasy books as a kid and when I saw this movie as an 11-year-old I knew I'd struck gold!  Boy, this was in the days right before CG technology got its claws on all the special effects.  But only 4 years after Star Wars, and special effects technology still wasn't TOO shabby.

But besides the special effects of this movie, the whole atmosphere is real ""Middle Earth"" (or Middle Ages) and is convincing. This is a finely shot movie, with nice wide angles on a nice wide-screen and a sound track that was meant for the movie theatre.  I was glad there were subtitles as well, as some of the British accents get a bit muddled at times (they don't bother translating the Latin however!).  There are no extras.

5 stars may include one for nostalgia.. some might find the story somewhat simple.. though it does contain a good deal of tension and as I mentioned before, atmosphere.

But.....once that princess goes into the dragon's lair.....man oh man!  From that point on it really is quite incredible.  These effects for a dragon in 1981?  It seems impossible.  The dragon really looks great.  The way it crawls, flies, breathes fire...it's all so right!

If I had fast-forwarded to the ""princess-goes-into-cave"" bit and watched from there...I would be thinking 5 stars.  But, unfortunately I slogged through until then (at which point I was not enjoying the film at all), so 3 stars it is.

I suggest you fast-forward until that point.  Here's what you miss:  Old wizard is hired to kill a dragon; one of the king's men wants to stop him; wizard allows himself to be murdered by the king's man; his apprentice takes up the quest; apprentice meets girl pretending to be a boy in order to get out of ""the lottery"" where the ""winning"" virgin is sacrificed to the dragon in order to spare the village; apprentice is locked up by the king, who fears if he fails the dragon will not be happy; princess figures out the lottery has been rigged for years to omit the rich families' virgins (including herself); she nobly rigs the next lottery so that all the names are her own; girl-who-was-pretending-to-be-a-boy's father is a blacksmith, who happens to have previously forged a spear called the ""Dragon Slayer"", gives it to the apprentice; girl-who-was-pretending-to-be-a-boy bravely makes a dragon-scale shield for apprentice.

249752,5,6300214052,"LOTR fans will plug right in to this 1981 film!

Here we have sorcerers, dragons, rotten old kings, and VIRGINS (to be sacrificed!) *.*

A very Dark Ages village must periodically sacrifice one of its beautiful young virgins to a local trouble-making dragon. The King conducts a  lottery, as needed, in the village to determine who the unlucky gal is to be for each sacrifice.

An assemblage of the locals gets damned tired of this process and so they travel to the castle of a renowned sorcerer to get him to resolve their dilemma; however, not everyone in the village agrees with this idea, knowing that if the plan goes awry, the dragon is going to REALLY be ticked off and the devastation is sure to be tremendous. So the King covertly sends his chief bad guy close behind the vigilante group to make sure that things go along as they always have.

The sorcerer (think ""Gandalf"") is killed in a test of his powers, prior to taking on the job, so it falls to his enthusiastic, but inept,  apprentice to complete the task.

I'll stop here to avoid major spoilers but be aware that this superb film boasts excellent cinematography, shrewd casting, and is conveyed in letterbox format. The filmscore by the great Alex North, (""Cleopatra,"" ""Spartacus,"" and other great high-end films), also adds a notable extra quality to this fine movie. The dragon is one of the best that you'll ever see in the vast world of film. I don't know that Peter Jackson will be able to top it in ""The Hobbit"" when that long-awaited film finally does premier!

The movie runs 109 minutes and is rated PG, probably due to one very quick flash of underwater nudity (from the side). This is one of the great films of all time -- a masterpiece!",1206921600,,1718,4.5732899022801305
249753,5,6300214052,"""Dragonslayer"" has become THE dragon film within the genre. There was ""Reign of Fire"", but there existed too many inconsistencies to make the film great. ""Dragonslayer"" does not go outside of the legends associated with the myth. I do not count films like ""Dragonheart"" and ""Eragon"", as dragons (within the mythical representations) do not speak. While both latter films could be considered suitable for children, the myth is much too sinister, and there also exist the references to evil and the domain of Hell.

""Dragonslayer"" makes no bones about the origins of the myth, and the dragon itself does not change it's character from the ""Hellspawn"" nature that it has occupied all throughout history. There has always been morbid curiosity regarding dragons for thousands of years, and in all cultures. It does seem strange that cultures that possess no similarities all have dragons! Some good, but for the most part, they represent evil incarnate.

In the film ""Dragonslayer"", the beast does not disapoint. It has ravaged a kingdom that has lost sight of it's primary purpose in protecting it's citizenry. The King has made a ""pact"" with it. The Kingdom supplies it with a virgin sacrifice at certain intervals (the result of a lottery), in exchange for it's crops remaining unburnt. A small band of villagers have taken it upon themselves to enlist the talents of a ""Wizard"". However, one of the King's most loyal soldiers kills the Wizard before he can do any good. The Wizard's Apprentice takes on the responsibilities his Master would have undertaken. The job is not without it's hazards, as the Apprentice finds out. The Wizard is ""summoned"" from the death he suffered earlier to aid the Apprentice in slaying the beast.

This film was released in 1981, and if memory serves, did not do well at the Box Office. It HAS been a modest success since it's release on VHS, and now DVD. ""Dragonslayer"" continues to draw more and more fans to the genre, which as of late, has turned them into cuddly talking flying lizards. The myth is all but gone, save for films such as this one.",1206748800,,2081,4.856338028169014
249754,5,6300214052,"Even when you consider this movie was made in 1981 and you have current movies like Reign of Fire and Eragon to contend with Dragonslayer beats them all. Not only do you have the coolest dragon ever, but you also have a very well written story with plenty of parallels moving alongside the main plot. Add to that a fantastic setting and talented cast and you have not only the best dragon movie, but also one of the best fantasy movies made so far.

Lets start with the dragon, Vermithrax Perjorative (cool name eh?). This is simply the best-designed dragon to ever reach the silver screen. From the conceptual design to how ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) made it come to life, Vermithrax is a delight to behold. Granted most of the dragon sequences are filmed using stop motion effects, but the process used makes the movements very fluid and believable. The dragon design itself is not the only beautiful thing about it. The way they tease you will a little shot of the tail here and a claw there makes seeing the dragon all that more satisfying at the final scenes. The dragon is definitely a treat to behold. The rest of the special effects (non-dragon related) are subtle and effective. Perfect for a movie of this sort.

The story is as well designed as the dragon. Everything falls into place like it should. This is very refreshing when many Hollywood movies tend to throw a scene in just to appease what they think the audience wants. Dragonslayer is all substance without any of that fluff. I particularly like some of the underlying subjects like the rise of Christianity and the end of the age of magic. The story is complimented by what I consider one of the most detailed and accurate settings for a medieval dragon story I have ever seen. You really feel like you are in the Dark Ages. The acting, from both veteran and young actors, is compelling and believable without any of the camp many fantasy films fall victim to.

The one thing I didn't really enjoy was the soundtrack. Granted it was done very professionally and the music is definitely befitting of the movie theme, I just found it more distracting than anything else on most of the scenes. There is no melody or pace set to the music. It just flies off all over the place like a mad scientist's experiment. I know most people who like Dragonslayer love the music. I just can't say that I am one of them.

Too bad the DVD treatment isn't as good. No special features to speak of. No commentary tracks. Nothing special at all. Would be nice to at least see a remastered version sometime in the future.

Compelling story, wonderful sets and location shots, talented and effective acting, spectacular special effects (especially considering when it was made), and a kick butt dragon design make Dragonslayer required viewing for any fantasy movie fan. This is especially true if you are into the swords and sorcery type or into dragons. If you want to see a really good story done really well then this too is the movie for you. Action fans might or might not get into it depending on how much action you really need, but there is probably not enough action for you testosterone freaks out there. All I can say is when you see this movie get ready to put away every preconceived notion you had on what a REAL dragon movie should be like.",1204070400,3,3312,4.569023569023569

249756,4,6300214052,"I have admitted previously that I am not a big fan of fantasy films with magic, fairies and unicorns in them.  However, this being the first of the genre I was exposed to as a child left an impression on me.  It was one of those movies they ran all the time on HBO when we first got cable.  Seeing it as an adult is another matter all together.

Nearly 30 years before Ally McBeal, Peter McNichol plays an ernest peasent boy / sourcerer's apprentice who is approached by a group of equally concerned peasents in a neighboring village.  Twice a year on the summer and winter equinox, they sacrifice a virgin to appease a dragon.  They are looking for help so they don't have to keep giving up their damsels and hope to emplore the skills of the sourcerer.  Peter McNichol joins the group in their trip back to their home village, and discovers quite by accident that the leader of the group is a woman disguised as a boy.  She said since she was born, her father has dressed her as a boy to keep her from the virgin lottery.  It's given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had, let alone increase her chances of staying alive.

What I liked about this movie best was the relationship between the crown and it's subjects, and the struggle of the haves and have nots.  Like the masquerading boy says to Peter, her father is poor and cannot afford to pay the bribes to say out of the lottery.  They have to resort to other means of avoidance.  Their king is arrogant and uncaring, saying only a few of their children are being sacrificed and it's not really a concern.  When his own daughter, Princess Elsbeth, learns that her name is not on the list of possible sacrifices, and some of the townspeople are paying bribes to stay out of the lottery, she altruisticly puts herself as the one and only in the grab bag.  When the king witnesses this, he is of course terrified, but she announces that she will give up her own life to appease for the risk they have taken and she had not due to her status.  The dragon, of course, is then slayed by our hero.  But, the damsel in distress (Princess Elsbeth) is not rescued, but still gives up her life.  She's the real hero of this story.",1188172800,,2199,4.361179361179361
249757,5,6300214052,"So what if the special effects didn't cost $200 million.  Did you see 'Hulk'? It was horrible. Some silly looking 'video game Hulk' bouncing around the city'. Ridiculous. Did you see 'Spider-Man'? A good film, but the CGI effects showed exactly what 'Spider-Man' is: a special effect. 'Dragonslayer' doesn't have those highly expensive CGI effects. What it does have (way back in 1981) is a fine cast, lead by a sorceror's apprentice (regardless of what some say about Peter MacNicol's casting, I thought he was perfect), and Sir. Ralph Richardson, perfect as the sorceror, a good supporting cast, and a 'model' dragon that easily puts the dragons in 'Dragonheart', 'Reign of Fire' and the silly 'Eragon' to shame. Frequent Spielberg/Lucas visual effects man Dennis Muren ('E.T.', 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Jedi', 'Jurassic Park', etc.) also worked on this film, and it shows. This dragon is the real thing. Ancient and scaly, bitter, terrifying, and unsympathetic. It's simply menacing. This is a beast that nightmares are made of. And this dragon was shot WITHOUT the aid of computers. Yet the effects look BETTER than today's CGI monstrosities. This dragon is truly a work of art. The bar has been set with 'Dragonslayer', so another filmmaker is going to have to do it better than Matthew Robbins' excellent fantasy, and that won't be easy. I do hope Paramount and Disney (they co-produced the film) put out a 2-disc set. A documentary about the making of the film featuring Dennis Muren, Matthew Robbins, and some of the cast members would certainly be entertaining, and well worth the purchase.",1188000000,,1602,5.0452830188679245

249759,5,6300214052,"I caught about 10-15 minutes of ""Dragonslayer"" on TV a few months back, which was my first exposure to this film, and I determined right then and there to eventually purchase it. When I finally bought it I watched it TWICE, something I rarely do.

THE STORY: A medieval kingdom is harrassed by a dragon, apparently the last of its species. The people decide to appease the horrific beast with regular sacrifices of virgin maidens. The virgins are selected through a questionable lottery system. When the King's daughter is picked for sacrifice, the monarch employs a sorcerer's apprentice, Peter MacNicol, to slay the dragon.

""Dragonslayer"" takes the ""Jaws"" route by not fully showing the beast until well into the second hour of the film. Prior to that revealing moment the film expertly builds up a heap of horrific anticipation concerning the creature. The first virgin sacrifice scene is particularly terrifying. When we finally DO see the monster it's definitely not a let down. Many viewers attest that this dragon is the best dragon to ever appear in film, even though the picture was made in 1981.

I've heard some complain that the protagonist, MacNicol, was wrong for the role. Nothing could be further from the truth. He's easy to relate to because he's a flawed human being with naive, boyish qualities, not a larger-than-life superhero (like, say, Conan or Beastmaster). I've also heard some complain that the heroine, Caitlin Clarke, is too ""man-ish"" looking. Well, duh, that fits into the whole sacrificial lottery plot. When Caitlin ultimately and uncertainly dons a dress and make-up she's woman enough.

The Dark Age sets/costumes/locations really impressed me. If you're in the mood for a top-of-the-line medieval flick with castles, dungeons, forests, villages, fair maidens, kings, sorcerers, etc. this is the one to see.

""Dragonslayer"" was an inexplicable flop when it was released in 1981, perhaps due to the glut of similar-themed pictures at the time. Regardless, it can now be treasured on DVD. It took me over 25 years to witness its magnificence but I finally did.",1177718400,4,2094,5.075581395348837

The dragon Vermithrax is hands down the best dragon ever created for film. There has not been a single movie with a dragon since that has managed to create the look and feel of what a dragon should be better than Vermithrax. Reign of Fire's creatures were close, but Vermithrax takes the title.

On that note, I can't help feel sorry for the old girl. Sure, people think she's evil, but really she was just a mother looking out for her young. Little ones gotta eat, y'know. People aren't always the top of the food chain, something we always seem to forget.

A good family movie if your kids are say 11 or older. Yes, there's violence, yes, there's a baby dragon gobbling up a girl (eating through her ankle more specifically) but it's no more violent or gory than the recent LOTR movies.

249791,4,6300214052,"""Dragonslayer"" is one of my favorite 1980's fantasy pieces.  Sadly, it was obscured by the bigger flicks--""Clash of the Titans,"" ""The Dark Crystal,"" ""Never-Ending Story"" and the perennial ""Princess Bride,""--plus the other bigger-budget SF films,  Star Trek II-V and Star Wars V-VI.  For me, I like that it is not the big budget spectacular that the other films were, and did not have the distracting all-star gala-feel that ""Titans"" had.  Similar to the City of Reno, it is the one of the smallest big-budget films I have seen.

Hence, we are treated to two unknowns--Peter MacNicol (Ghostbusters II, Alley McBeal, 24) and Ian McDiarmid (Emperor Darth Sidious) in a ""don't blink or you'll miss him"" role as Brother Jacobus.  Lucas would agree--this enhances the story, since you focus on the film, rather then the distracting game of ""Where's Waldo"" that familiar faces can breed.

The film is essentially a milieu piece--the faux Middle English middle England that is the basis for all post-Tolkien fantasy.  But the theme is the arresting thing: it is about the corrupt leadership that makes a deal with the devil (or the dragon in this story) to keep the peace at the price of a pentannual sacrifice of a fair virgin.

This deal itself is corrupt--suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune instead of taking up arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them--but the corruption runs deeper. First, the king and other nobility exempt their daughters, sending the peasant girls instead. Much like wartime drafts.

The second issue is how this set up affects Valerian.  When her father disguises her as a boy to avoid the draft-lottery, he inadvertently alienates her from herself and he sexuality.  When she dons the dress at the effigy-burning, she embraces who she is, especially her sexuality. The dance with Galen is symbolically obvious.

Lastly, Casiodorus Rex is so base, so superficial that he claims credit for slaying the dragon.  In retrospect, this was to be expected.

This film is full of heroics.  We have Galan mantleing himself as a wizard--no angst, no refusals of the call, but brash gusto.  Valerian courageously end-runs around  the corrupt king and hires a dragonslayer.  The Blacksmith forges the spear behind the back of said corrupt king.  (This is a perfect Daddy-Daughter team-up.)  Princess Elspeth gives her life in order to save the peasants--a reverse Marie Antoinette.  And then Ulrich the Wizard takes James bond's advice and dies twice to slay the dragon.

The coda-ending was a gag, but the gag worked, since it rounded out the theme of the corrupt system, and Galan and Valrian turning their back to the whole mess, and making their way . . . and with magic in the air.

The special effects still stand up. Instead of doing the Harryhausen stop-motion (as was done in ""Titans""), they opted for go-motion, puppetry, and animation. The overall effect is eerily realistic, and aportent of things to come. In fact, the SFX stand up to the next great dragon movie, ""Reign of Fire.""

The film is rated PG, but I suggest a PG-13 rating, due to the graphic deaths of Princess Elspeth and Brother Jacobus (the gnawing lizardlings and the charred body were too much), and the ""revealing"" skinny-dipping scene.  Parents beware.",1172534400,3,3276,4.954212454212454
249792,5,6300214052,"Being a long time D&D player and fantasy buff the cutesy friendly talking dragons always make me want to puke.  This dragon gave me no such problems. It looks and acts mean like a dragon should. This is going to sound strange but I also found it more ""realistic"" than most dragons. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in dragons; however it looks like the designer(s) took some effort to design a creature that could actually fly if it were real. It has a large wing area fairly lean body and a long counterbalancing tail. When it flies you get the feeling it has speed and power and is not struggling to stay airborne. On top of that it only has two legs so it gives the impression it actually could have evolved from some primitive dinosaur. The movie itself has a good fantasy plot. It walks the line well between being too cheesy and taking itself too seriously.  In fact this is probably my favorite fantasy movie. I won't go into the details of the move since I'm sure there are 20 other reviews that do, however I will say if you are a like the fantasy genre at all you won't be disappointed.",1171065600,,1099,4.330097087378641

It was a box office failure when it was released, but thankfully it has developed a following. Unlike many fantasy films of the 1980's, ""Dragonslayer"" holds up today. While the special effects are (still) impressive and the production design is gritty, the film's secret weapon is the story. It is set up so that you think you know what will happen...and it doesn't. ""Dragonslayer"" sets up and then decontructs fantasy cliches. All in all, a great film that is worth checking out if you are a fan of fantasy and adventure.",1169942400,,640,4.62280701754386

There are several twists in this movie that I didn't see coming on first viewing, which was great and still enjoyable. And it's more than a 'fight the dragon' story, but a 'coming of age' and a love story as well.

Peter MacNicol did a wonderful job in this movie portraying the enthusiasm, overconfidence, and that touch of innocence you see in Galen, a young Wizard who has never been tested. He had me rooting for him all the way. And the supporting cast is wonderful.

I wrote her when the film came out telling her as much, and received a hand-written thank you letter.  I learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004.

However, not that many complain of the violence or disturbing content. I understand, of course, that violence in a movie about an evil dragon is pretty much essential, but one of the scenes here was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. When our hero enters the dragon's lair, he comes across baby dragons devouring the corpse of a young woman. No holds barred here; everything is shown in graphic detail and it nearly turned me off the whole movie. This just goes to show that the rating system in the 80's was a total joke, because this movie is rated PG even though that one scene would've earned an R-rating easy nowadays. I docked one star for this scene since I saw it as totally unnecessary to the plot. By this point in the movie I think we already understand that the dragon's totally evil; the fact that she demands maiden sacrifices should be proof enough, so we really didn't need to see her offspring acting like piranahs. The movie well illustrates not only the evil of a dragon but the evil and desperate selfishness of mankind; offering a person for sacrifice is one of the most brutal things I could possibly imagine and I almost totally lost my sympathy for the king and townspeople.

249811,5,6300214052,"Well, in a sense this movie is a metaphor for life. Okay, here's what I mean, so Galen the apprentice wants to become a full-blown realized sorcerer, and at the end he does by manifesting a white horse after battling the dragon, going through everything and rescuing his maiden Valerian. (This isn't a traditional review as you can tell, because the message of this movie is very near and dear to me and goes universally beyond its content.) Sure the king takes the credit for doing everything and he's a ""normal jerk"" but Galen gets the real power at the end of the movie as proven by the white horse he manifests and the love of his woman who balances him. But, above all, Dragonslayer is a moral tale about a student paying the cost to be the master and fully realizing that in all beneficial ways. Now, with this movie, I overlook most of the acting and special effects(although it is all wonderful and great) for thwe genuine core message of the movie and the powerful metaphor it presents as a whole. Sure, I gave away the ending, but the mental and spiritual voyage you take through this movie transcends all that. And I'll say something more traditional here, I'm glad there were no sequels made, because one Dragonslayer movie has enough metaphor and life-lesson fuel for a lifetime. By the way, I first saw this movie with my sister when I was six years old, and numerous times on cable and video, the message just gets ever fresher and fresher & deeper and deeper as time goes on. Usually, I rate books, and I haven't mentioned this in my bio page as one of my favorite movies as of this writing, but, I will, because this is a powerful and albeit underrated movie movie.

The special effects craze set off by Star Wars had everyone in Hollywood trying to outdo themselves and the competition.  The real treat is in the relatively unknown cast of actors.  Galen (Peter MacNicol) heads into the unknown on a quest to kill a dragon after his sorcerer master is killed.  He's geeky and semi-feminine, but manages the role as the would-be hero.  Caitlin Clarke his his love interest and inspiration, disguised as a boy to keep her from the lottery of sacrificial virgins, she emerges as the heroine of the story and does rather well.  Is Dragonslayer the greatest fantasy movie ever filmed?  Not at all.  Is it entertaining?  Definitely!  The story is rich and the surroundings are drab and dismal and the obscure actors play their parts without faltering.  Overall, for the time this came out, this movie is quite an achievement, both in the visual and mental capacities.

249813,3,6300214052,"This movie is one of those underrated little gems that turn up every now and then.  It is a movie that is a bit darker than the usual Disney fare and I would definately put it in the same vain as ""The Black Hole"", though not quite as good.  The movie is about a kingdom that is terrorized by a dragon and forced to sacrifice young maidens to the beast to apease it.  The common folk try to enlist the help of a wizard to aid them, but when he dies suddenly all they are left with is the aid of the wizard's young apprentice Galen.  The story is surprisingly good and a little deeper than first meets the eye. The tale does become a little dark and it deals with issues of class and privillege between the aristocrats and common folk of the kingdom.  The movie does suffer from a lack of star power as the only name I recognise is Peter MacNicol from ""Ally MacBeal"" fame (it's the Biscuit!) and some of the acting is downright bad.  I thought this was a good story though and the quaint special effects endear it to me even more.  All in all I give it 3.5 stars rounded down.",1143244800,3,1074,4.134615384615385

At its time, this movie had great special effects.  Also as far as a disney production, this movie explores some very dark themes, as well as developing an incredible storyline.  Unfortunately poor acting and slightly slow pacing prevented this title from reaching a huge audience like modern fantasy movies.  Dragonslayer is an essential reference for any study of the history of fantasy moviemaking.  As a unique storline made before everything coming out of hollywood followed formulaic principiles, this movie is an absolute gem.  I highly reccommend this movie for viewers with refined tastes.

249816,5,6300214052,"This has been one of my favorite films for 25 years, so it's a great joy to get it on widescreen crystal-clear DVD.  I could wish for some extras, but the film itself is so worth five stars that I'm thrilled with this no-frills cheap issue.  Got it for $5.50 in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart, too.

What makes this such a great movie?  For one thing there's the presence of the awesome Sir Ralph Richardson, who made a notable comeback to film in 1981 with ""Dragonslayer"" and ""Time Bandits.""  His screen time is limited here, but his indomitable presence looms over every frame.  When he's on screen he commands attention, and when he's not on screen the characters bemoan the fact.

For another thing there's the presence of several subplots, which keeps the age-old tale of ""slaying the dragon"" from being stretched thin at all.  The primary subplot involves the sorcerer's apprentice (Peter MacNicol) overconfidently taking up the master's mantle, and the complications that ensure.  MacNicol is young and fresh-faced, and it takes him awhile to admit he's in over his head.  This is all pulled off quite nicely.  Another terrific subplot involves the princess, whose character is revealed very dramatically, heroically, and believably.  Yet another subplot is the romance between the apprentice and Caitlin Clark's character, woven into the story equally perfectly.  And finally there's the subplot of who gets credit for the beast's eventually being slain; some wry humor there for sure.

And then there's the dragon.  WOW what a dragon!  This is easily the most wondrous dragon I've ever seen.  She's not a nice one, either.  The conflicts when she interacts with humans are ominous and tremendously gripping.  The film was nominated for an Oscar not only for its FX, but also for its music, beautifully accenting the action in light moments, action scenes, and pastoral interludes.  It's unfortunate for ""Dragonslayer"" that it happened to be nominated in the same year as ""Raiders Of the Lost Ark,"" so not only did it lose out on Oscar it also lost out on Saturns and Hugos.  Ah well, it's no putdown to say that ""Dragonslayer"" is not quite up to the level of ""Raiders.""  Few films are.

My highest recommendation.  Make sure you get it in widescreen; the full-screen version blurs the images and makes the whole thing look cheesy.  Besides, it's an absolutely gorgeous movie and you'll want to see every pixel.  Enjoy!",1139356800,3,2422,4.903940886699507
249817,3,6300214052,"Considering this film is now almost 25 years old, DRAGONSLAYER holds up pretty decently in the special effects department.  The firebreathing dragon is convincing and when it's on screen, it certainly dominates the action.  Perhaps this film's fault is that the action sequences are too far and few between and we're left with a formulaic love story of a wizard's apprentice and the local lovely.  I never found Peter MacNicol's presence commanding enough; while a good actor, MacNicol is just too gangly and naive to be convincing as a hero.  Ralph Richardson adds some muscle in his all too brief scenes, and Caitlin Clarke (who died from ovarian cancer in 2004) does well as boy/girl Valarian.

249819,5,6300214052,"In the early 1980s there was a spate of fantasy movies -- ranging from movies like ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""Excalibur"", to distinctly B-grade productions like ""The Sword and the Sorceror"", and ""Hawk the Slayer"".  This was probably due to the phenomenal success of ""Star Wars"", as science fiction and fantasy have always marched pretty closely beside one another as genres.  ""Dragonslayer"" was one of the better films of this type, and the movie's lack of financial success is frankly inexplicable to me.  The best guess I can make to account for it is that the movie is not so action packed as ""Star Wars"" or ""Conan the Barbarian"", and not quite so fast paced, so perhaps audiences were let down by that.  But it's still a great movie.  The production values are second to none.  The film perfectly captures the look of the Dark Ages -- the early medieval period, no more than a century or two after the fall of the Roman Empire.  This was a time when records were scanty, many communities were more isolated than at any time before or since, Christianity was a new religion, and just one faith among many, and a time when people really believed in magic and the supernatural.  It is the PERFECT setting for such a movie.  The cast is superbly chosen.  Peter MacNicol makes a good Galen, who is naive, brash, and possesses the arrogant confidence of youth, but who finally comes to understand he didn't have it all as completely figured out as he thought.  Ralph Richardson, in one of his last roles, is superb as the wise old sorceror.  Peter Eyre is thoroughly believable as the weak-willed king of Urland (presumably one of the smaller kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England) who has made what he sincerely believes is the best bargain he can make with an invincible supernatural creature.  John Hallam is a charismatic, though ultimately villanous king's henchman.  And Caitlin Clarke is cast perfectly as a woman who is just barely androgynous enough to pass for a boy, and yet just barely attractive enough to pass for a romantic interest for Peter MacNicol's character.

What is most surprising, perhaps, is the dragon.  It was breathtaking in 1981.  Today it still looks pretty good.  Obviously, it's not quite as realistic as today's CGI creatures.  But given the limitations of pre-CGI special effects, it's still really impressive, and doesn't look completely dated like, for example, the 1933 Kong does.  The ""go-motion"" techniques they used to film the dragon Vermithrax would be superseded by CGI effects before too many years had passed, but they were still a huge improvement on the stop motion animation that was previously the only way to put such mythical creatures on the screen.

This movie benefits from a really good story, great special effects, a first rate cast, and cinematography that is positively superlative.  It should have done better at the box office.  Some movies just don't get fully appreciated till later.  ""Bladerunner"" is another such movie.  While this movie has not been as influential as ""Bladerunner"", it has, like that movie, been more appreciated since it was released than it was at the time of its debut.  Great fantasy movies are really pretty thin on the ground.  This movie is one of the better ones.",1133136000,6,3247,4.84573502722323

249892,2,6300214052,"I've never been one for fantasy films, and watched this feeling  a bit apprehensive. Have no idea why, but I got the feeling it was going to turn out to be another Excalibur, but I managed to sit through this. (And I was right, there did out to be a ""dragon slaying sword"" that appeared. It's kind of similar!)

I was quite impressed during this, as the brief glimpses we got of the dragon, before seeing the full effect towards the end, considering the film was released in 1981, the effects were quite stunning. They're nothing compared to what computers can do now, but for that time, even though the effects were quite dodgy, they were brilliant! And I was shocked, I was expecting them to be really bad. Shows how much I know eh?

But apart from that, I didn't really like this movie. I thought the acting was dreadful, and the story had been done loads before, I was reminded a lot of Sword In The Stone a lot and my dad watching it with me, was reminded of Lord Of The Rings, for some strange reason. And the nudity wasn't exactly ground breaking, although I suppose considering it's a Disney movie. I suppose it would have been ground breaking back then, to have (albeit brief) glimpses of nudity in a PG movie. I thought the nudity was alright, but you don't actually see that much.

It's such a shame actually because the very androgynous actress who played Valerian, Caitlin Clarke, actually died in 2004 from ovarian cancer. She looked really young in this movie! OK, she was 23, but she looked much younger!

I would not recommend this movie, even though a friend from work greatly disagrees with my opinion, and so will most of the reviewers on here. Hey, at least I feel guilty for not liking the film, when there's so many reviews praising it!",1124755200,5,1759,4.484375

So, it came as a real surprise when I saw it for the first time on video courtesy of my brother. The bottom line, though, is that DRAGONSLAYER is a pretty good movie. The dragon is very nasty, life in the dark age kingdom is appropriately squalid, and there are plenty of tense moments as the plot unfolds.

Dragon stories aren't for everyone but, THE LORD OF THE RINGS aside, this is better than most of the fantasy/adventure flics around. There are a few gory bits, so it might not be suitable for small kids. Otherwise, if a good tale from the fantasy genre has any appeal for you, you'll probably enjoy DRAGONSLAYER.

249894,4,6300214052,"This movie did poorly in theaters.  When you consider the occasionally slow pacing, and the reasonably accurate surroundings, it is not about a period of time which many people would like to revisit.  Stylistically it is somewhat similar to another excellent movie that should be in a similar era, ""Excalibur.""  However, this movie is a rare fantasy movie that attempts to be true to classic fantasy, and the dragon is a classic non-speaking, fire-breathing, virgin-eating beastie.

We meet wizard Ulrich (veteran actor Ralph Richardson, just a couple of years before the end of his career) and apprentice wizard Galen (Peter MacNichol in his first film role - well predating ""Ally McBeal"" and ""Numb3rs"") as the movie begins.  Valerian (Caitlin Clarke in her first movie role) beseeches Ulrich to rid the kingdom in which she lives of its resident dragon.  Ulrich decides that he must journey to the kingdom of Casiodorus Rex (Peter Eyre) and rid the kingdom of the scaly menace.  Unfortunately, Ulrich does not survive the journey.

When Galen arrives he has a struggle to convince the king that he is a wizard, though he is not.  Galen's first attempt to kill the dragon (whose name is Vermithrax Pejorative) appears successful, but since the movie would have been very short, his attempt is less than successful and all he has managed to do is anger the dragon.  Previously the dragon was mollified by a single sacrifice of a virgin female a year; now the dragon is very angry and it starts flaming and maiming and making a nuisance of itself.

The complexity of the plot increases from this point, and I would rather leave the surprises for viewers to discover for themselves.  I will say that I was rather surprised at several points.  I can also say that young Galen acquits himself quite satisfactorily, and manages to make the end of this movie quite interesting and exciting.

This movie used a combination of special effects that improve the quality of the dragon scenes.  Genuine flame-throwers created the dragon fire.  I originally thought that the fire was animated, but at least two separate sources agree that the fire was genuine.  The dragon was at least partially robotic and animated by a computer, which is part of the reason that the dragon frequently appears so realistic.  The special effects were breakthrough at the time, one of the many improvements in special effects in the era of the first Star Wars trilogy.

This movie was nominated for seven awards; two Oscars, four Saturn Awards, and a Hugo Award.  This movie missed out on every award, mostly because the main competition was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Excalibur,"" and ""Clash of the Titans,"" all outstanding movies.  However, the number of nominations and the quality of the competition should give you a further feel for the quality of this movie.

Few fantasy movies attempt to treat their subject matter seriously.

Its ruler ,King Tynan( John Hallam )buys off the dragon offering it a sacrificial virgin each year in exchange for its leaaving the kingdom in peace ,the unlucky victim being chosen by lottery .

When the King's daughter Elspeth ( Chloe Salaman) offers herself as the sacrificial victim an old magician Ulrich ( Ralph Richardson )is called on to kill the beast .When he fails the task falls to his apprentice Galen ( Peter McNichol),but he at least initially only succeeds in making matters worse .

There is a sub-plot of sorts which is to do with the supplanting of magic and superstition by the rise of Christianity ,which while not explored in depth does help in adding some substance and weight to the basic storyline .

This is good to look at .the movie was sshot in Wales and Scotland and makes good use of the rugged terrain found in both naations The sets are impressive and Derek Valint contributes some evocative photography which ensures a nicely brooding atmosphere .The kingdom of Urland is shown as being dirty ,dank and dingy and therefore removed from the traditional fairy tale kingdoms where all is sweetness and light

The special effects -courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic -are well done with an impressive computer generated dragon ensuring there is no sense of anti-climax when the beast is unveiled before our eyes. The acting too is better than usual for the genre with Richardson impressing in a relatively small role and a sparky contribution from Caitlin Clarke as Galen's love interest .McNicchol is perhaps a tad too lightweight as Galen but its still a decent performance

My two main reservations are that the script is too leisurely with all the major action scenes being late in the picture, by which time some viewers may have lost a little interest,and that it is quite gory at times ,making it a little frightening for some younger viewers

The moody atmosphere of scanty population, grime, fear and desperation is combined beautifully. And the monster is MONSTROUS. Not cute and lovable like Sean Connery in Dragonheart: that dragon would not have been able to get off the ground: but the Dragonslayer beastie has gorgeous, enormous wings and a lithe body like a serpent and is utterly believable when she takes to the air (I hope that when someone finally does the Hobbit, that they take their model from this movie and not Dragonheart). There is no shlocky ending like in Dragonheart: but rather a suitable ""unfinished"" sort of feel to it. Yeah, the dragon is dead, but so is the wizard (and therefore, magic?). A new age begins when the putrid (and cowardly) king steps down from his gilded carriage and inserts the sword with a distasteful grimace into the steaming carcase of the vanquished dragon, and is hailed as ""dragon slayer!"" (The chronicles will give him the credit and the true heroes are never to be mentioned.)",1111708800,3,1177,4.802955665024631
249950,5,6300214052,"Ultimately, ""Dragonslayer"" succeeds where the vast majority of monster movies fail, which is the point at which you get to see the creature and it is a big disappointment.  Very few movies had really great monsters when I was growing up and you get to the point where you just expect them to be bad.  Even when the make up is pretty good, say Boris Karloff in the original version of ""The Mummy"" or Oliver Reed in ""The Curse of the Werewolf,"" you get shorted on how often the monster actually gets to be on screen.  ""Dragonslayer"" ups the ante because there is a big build up to the point when you finally get to see the dragon.  But for my money it is well worth the wait because the folks at Industrial Light & Magic delivery even though we are talking 1981 special effects.

The story in ""Dragonslayer"" combines a couple of recognizable plot lines from the fantasy genre.  First there is the hapless young apprentice, Galen (Peter MacNicol), trying to learn his craft from a great wizard, Ulrich (Ralph Richardson).  I am certainly reminded of Mickey Mouse from ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" in ""Fantasia,"" except that Galen is a lot more earnest.  Second, there is the fact that Casiodorus Rex (Peter Eyre), the ruler of the land, has been sacrificing virgins to keep the local dragon from leveling the countryside.  Young Valerian (Caitlin Clarke) arrives to beseech Ulrich, the last wizard around, to kill the dragon, which is probably the last of its kind as well.

The only problem is that Ulrich has died, which means that young Galen has to become a dragonslayer.  Galen wants to do the great deed for the right reasons, but there is also the Princess Elspeth (Chloe Salaman) to consider, along with all the other young virgins forced to participate in the grim lottery.  Casiodorus is not thrilled by the prospect of the fate of his kingdom resting on the shoulders of Galen, so he tries to thwart the young man's plans.  However, there is somebody who thinks that the rules of the game in Urland have to be changed.

Beyond the Oscar nominated special effects (and musical score by Alex North) what makes ""Dragonslayer"" work is that it takes place in a grungy medieval world where everybody is dirty and outright despair seems like an appropriate response to each sunrise.  In such a world sacrificing a virgin once a year seems rather reasonable, and an act of heroism seems improbable, especially when your hopes rest on the baby-faced Galen.  The atmosphere and the special effects fit together just perfectly, and Ralph Richardson's performance as the sorcerer gives the film its memorable performance.

The casting of MacNichol is seen as problematic by some, especially those familiar with his stellar comedy work on ""Chicago Hope"" and ""Ally McBeal,"" but I think he works well in this particular context.  The idea here is that the hero is not somebody who wants to be a great fighter with a sword but a sorcerer using potions and magicks.  MacNichol looks like somebody who would be more comfortable with a staff than a sword, so that when he actually has to pick up a spear and shield to fight the dragon he looks really uncomfortable.  Then he sees the dragon and he looks scared.  We see the dragon, so we completely understand.

Although a lot of the elements are familiar to everyone weaned on Tolkien and excited by the original ""Star Wars"" films, there are some attempts to be different.  I especially liked the fate of the Princess and the ending has a sense of fatalism we rarely get in a fantasy film, with or without a monster.  Unfortunately, the DVD version of ""Dragonslayer"" has absolutely nothing in terms of bonus features (not even the trailer), but at least the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen so you can enjoy all of the Scottish landscape.  More importantly, there is the CGI dragon that mandates this one getting five stars because that dragon is that good.

249951,4,6300214052,"Considering that one of the roles has been given to none other than Sir Ralph Richardson, should speak volumes about this tiny fantasy movie.

Despite the product of the early eighties, in which movies like ""Conan the Barbarian"" and other similar products very highly popular, this film has the merit to have a dignified treatment, with an original story and a solid cast of newcomers.

I will not spoil you the surprise of the story, but suffice it to say, that no, the Dragon does NOT speak, nor does he (or is it a she?) consider the meaning of life. He rather spits fire and kills people with ease, and therefore must be destroyed.

This is what this movie is all about. But more than that, it is also about the vanity, greed, prejudice and superstition that rules mankind and hence gives more importance to an otherwise harmless creature...

it is a multi-faceted movie. So much so, that nothing is truly what it seems to be and everything is revealed toward the grand finale, which inevitably comes.

The transfer by Paramount has been undertaken with accuracy and grace. Excellent image resolution, fantastic widescreen rendition of the landscapes, and a wonderful surround soundtrack make it the definitive version to own.

249954,4,6300214052,"Fantasy movies such as this are non-existent these days. Gimme back the days of The Dark Crystal, Jim Henson and the Gremlins. For a family movie this is also very straight-faced too. There is not much humor in it, but that only adds to the overall weird tone.

The story is of a wizard apprentice called Galen (a very young Peter MacNicol) who goes on a quest to slaughter a Dragon terrorizing the people of Urland (Ireland maybe?). There are long moments of quiet and a strange atmosphere brewing around the whole movie. It looks and feels quite unique.

No doubt this is owed a lot to the fabulous widescreen compositions, visual effects that range from not bad to surprisingly good and stunning scenery and locations. Indeed the mood of this film is something I've never come across in a fantasy film. Plus for a film that is rated a simple PG, there was quite a lot of graphic gore, violence and even slight nudity. Surprising, but it adds to the boldness of the production. You would never get a family movie like this these days. I will take Dragonslayer over Harry Potter anytime.

Filmed in Panavision, the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture looks really great in most scenes but in others there is a small problem with the black levels. The soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby 5.1 and it is surely loud and forceful. Unfortunately there are ZERO extras.

249955,4,6300214052,"Dragonslayer is one of my favorite films, for several reasons.

  Firstly, the performances are excellent.  They're believable, restrained, convincing portrayals that never stoop to cartoonish stereotypes.  The costumes and sets are first rate and authentic to a tee.  The locations are breathtaking, filmed in Wales and the Isle of Skye - the countryside looks as though it has produced its fair share of dragons and wizards

 Secondly, the plot and script go deeper than the surface.  There's a lot more going on here than just good versus evil, wizard versus dragon.  The way that Ulrich (Ralph Richardson) regales himself in proper sorcerer's attire so as to make the right first impression is great.  With little dropped lines the director and screenwriter create a very rich and complete world.  Ulrich asks the travelers why they don't go talk to such and such other wizard...or how about those sisters that are witches?  ""Or what about Old Grimbold?  I heard tell he slew a dragon once...""  ""They're all dead.  You're the only one left.""  With just a few seconds of screen time we get an image of a world in transition, where the old sorcerers are dying out along with the dragons.  The times they are changing.  The politics at work in the court of the king of Urland are as true to reality as if they had happened last week.  All the give and take and the hard decisions a leader must make are there to be seen.  A village community under immense stress is shown honestly, and the ways they react are true to life.

 Thirdly, and this is what has kept me loving this film for the last 20 years, is that this film more than any other dealing with this subject matter, even more than Lord of the Rings, makes me wonder what it was really like in that age of the world.  What was it like to be in Britain at the turn of the tide between paganism and Christianity?  The hope of redemption and eternal life through The Church might have felt like thin gruel if a dragon needed slaying, and a sorcerer of the Old School said he could do it.  It's a silly idea, really, but I'm sure that similar sorts of things did happen, back when the world was not quite so old.  There is a wonderful, tiny touch near the end, one you might not notice.  (Spoiler alert.)  Ulrich, back from the dead, meets Valerian again and as he is about to do battle with the dragon, he says a few last words to her.  As he does this, he pauses and picks up the necklace she's wearing.  It's a tiny iron cross, a gift from her father.  And as he looks back at her, there is just the faintest tinge (Ralph Richardson is the master of faint tinges) of recognition in the old wizard's eyes that he is being replaced, that his world of magic is being set aside for one of faith.

 And that's allright with him.  Perhaps he knew it all along.  Perhaps he's part of the transition; we'll never know.  But he has one last job to do before the new day dawns.  A fine, fine film, marred only by a clunky and somewhat uneven soundtrack.",1091923200,8,3002,4.420475319926874
249956,4,6300214052,"Unjustly overlooked by movie audiences in 1981, this dark, sometimes brooding fantasy adventure filled me with excitement and wonder as a young boy watching it on the big screen.
I am so happy to see it arrive on DVD, and even more happy to own a copy.
The story is a comparitively simple one, and yet complex in its own way. Travelers from a far off land arrive at the door of an elderly wizard and implore him to travel back with them to face a dragon who takes young, offered-up women in exchange for leaving the kingdom alone, as the wizard comments: 'Your King has made a deal with the devil.'
In what appears to be nothing but an act of apparent suicide the wizard has a sceptical warrior plunge a dagger into his heart, much to the horror of his apprentice. The reason for the act of violence is not revealed until much later.
Feeling it is his duty, the young wizard-in-training travels back with the band to take on the monster in a final climactic battle for honor, courage and ultimately for love.
Firstly, the special effects (by Industrial Light and Magic) are simply stunning for their day and even today they still impress (even more remarkable when you consider that CGI would not appear on movie screens until WILLOW some 7 years later). The final battle with the winged beast has all the suspense, and wrist clenched tension of any movie I know. The actors are well drawn and the storyline is both compelling and heart-stopping.
Overall DRAGONSLAYER has a charm to it that is rarely seen in movies today. It is a special effects fantasy drama with real heart. For that reason alone movie audiences of today should make a point of seeing it.",1091145600,6,1658,4.548494983277592
249957,4,6300214052,"Yes, of course it is showing its age.  It was made in 1981.  This does not change the fact that this movie totally owns.  This rocked back in the day and it continues to rock if for nothing but the pure nostalgia factor (showing this movie to my older brother will be sure to conjure memories).  1981 seemed to be a big year for movies about Knights, swords and sorcery.  This was one of the best and remained the best for a long time to come.  Only today, with slick computer graphics do we see the failures of the special effects here and there.  However, they tried their best, really they did.  It remains an impressive tale about magic, progress, advancement, and heroism.  One of the more memorable lines from this movie was something like :
""Well, I'm glad that magic is fading from this world, the dragons are fading along with it.""
Hmmm.",1089504000,,846,4.441558441558442
249958,5,6300214052,"This has been a favorite of mine over the years, and its stood the test of time--I still like it!  I especially like the characters, the way it lets you understand their motives without asking you to accept them.  It shows you peoples foibles as well as their strengths.  It includes several horrific scenes, but doesn't bog down in explicit detailing of gore (for example, when the princess sacrifices herself to the dragon, you don't see her killed, but only see a glimpse of her body where the baby dragons are feeding).  Or, the old servant is murdered, and before he dies he says, ""Someone's shot me!"" in a voice of surprise, like he can't understand why someone would do that.  And the dragon was believable to me.  I accepted its sadness at being at the end of an era and without having a place in the new one.  Dragonslayer is a good story supported by special effects and not the other way around--a movie with loads of special effects and no story--that would be boring!",1089244800,,980,4.534090909090909
249959,4,6300214052,"Dragonslayer is very much like a Merchant-Ivory costume drama -only with a fire-breathing dragon! Like Merchant-Ivory films, Dragonslayer is well-written, beautifully photographed, designed with an amazing eye for authentic costumes, sets and props to the last detail and masterfully acted by all the supporting characters. Unfortunately, like other M-I films, there is little action and a very unsypathetic ""hero"".
The plot: For years, the kingdom of Urland has managed to avoid being incinerated by a dragon by offering up maidens as a twice-annual meal. Like the draft during Vietnam, the lottery by which the virgins are chosen is more or less rigged to guarantee that the children of the rich and/ or well-connected aren't conscripted as dragon bait. One thing the movie should have addressed is the question of why the virgins of Urland don't ""dodge the draft"" in a rather easy and obvious (and fun!) way.
Since there are no slots in the ""champagne unit"" of the Texas Air Guard available to a young commoner named Valerian, she has spent her youth dressed like a boy. However, she refuses to just sit by as other girls are devoured, so she and other peasants seek out a wizard to kill the dragon.
The only one they find is Ulric (played perfectly as an almost senile hermit by Ralph Richardson), an octogenarian who lives 300 miles away and appears to already have one foot in the grave. He doesn't even look like he can travel all the way to Urland, let alone fight a dragon. He is also handicapped by a a clumsy and dull-witted apprentice, Galen (Peter MacNicol).
Enter Tyrian (Jack Hallam) a wonderfull villain played by a wonderfull actor. He thinks the old magician is a fraud and a troublemaker and calls him out. When he goes into his harangue about how wizards are con-artists and says ""But comes a doubter..."" you realize it's a great performance. Like others in Urland, Tyrian actually benefits from the sacrifice of young girls to the dragon. Like any society beset by a scary enough menace, people will allow their ""protector"" to get away with anything -even murder- if it means keeping the beast at bay. Tyrian serves King Cassiodorus Rex (Peter Eyre), who came up with the lottery (the ""tiles"" look suspiciously like old-style Army dog tags -a clever touch) after his brother, King Gaiseric tried to kill the dragon but was himself killed.
The over-eager and under-intelligent Galen tries to kill the dragon himself. Between his bungling, the King's conniving and pressure from the villagers whose homes and crops get turned to ashes, Galen finds himself in a deeper and deeper pit.
At this point, the movie falters. The fight scene between Tyrian and Galen is almost humorously bad. The fight with the dragon is great, but suddenly stopped for no apparent reason -it just switches to dawn the next day. And the way the dragon is beaten lacks any kind of thrill or suspense whatsoever. Peter MacNicol is badly miscast and other reviewers are right in pointing out how conspicuous American accents in a movie with an almost entirely British cast kills the suspension of disbelief.
Another problem is the score by Alex North. It's just plain bad.
On the other hand, Caitlin Clarke (American accent notwithstanding) is pretty good. Other reviewers think of her as a bit of a Plain Jane, but they forget that she is pretty (though not by absurd movie standards) and she can't have Kate Beckinsale's cute little button nose and pass herself off as a boy. The rest of the cast is perfect.
Of all the sword & sorcery films ever made, Dragonslayer is the best scripted and by far the best acted. The costumes are 100% accurate for the 6th-7th centuries in northern Europe, contrary to some assertions made here. If it had more action and a more appealing hero with real chemistry with the female lead, this movie would be a classic.
Finally, the dragon (Vermithrax pejorative) is the best dragon ever on screen, with the ones from Reign of Fire a close second. Vermithrax actually has personality! The special effects guys must have had Lee Strasburg coach her! The fact that she is used sparingly helps, too.
This is a good, but not great movie and I recommend it.",1084060800,7,4177,4.818941504178273

It's a good ride.
The score, however, is utterly awful. Cacophonic, badly paced, and uninspiring. It doesn't even have a theme.

It is a solid entertainment and most of the dragon effects can still stand alongside any seen in ""Lord of the Rings"", as they were done by ILM.  One wishes that there was at least the movie trailer on this DVD, as it has no extra's to it.  Perhaps they will put out a deluxe edition some time in the future.  Those who write off early eighties fantasy films, (and there are a lot to write off!), as cheesy, really should take a serious look at this.  The only time one wishes the special effects were better is in the Dragon's offspring, where they don't have the believability that the main dragon has.
This was one of the last roles for Sir Ralph Richardson, and he makes the absolute best of it.  His scorcerer can stand alonside Merlin or any other.
The period detail is another plus.  being made after ""Excalibur"", (as well as some fine lesser known films of the 70's), the costumes and other effects have a wonderful believeability to them.

250012,3,6300214052,"Fantasy is very much a sometimes thing for me.  And I have to admit it's always interesting to see how genre fans respond to a given film.  It's not always what you would expect.  I found DRAGONSLAYER a little plodding at times, and the script didn't seem like much.  In fact, I dozed more than once and had to thank the Force or the gods or whatever that I could hit my back button.  So naturally, I was interested in what hardcore fantasy buffs would say about the film.  Judging from the comments below, true genre films LOVE this film...and pretty much for the reasons  you might expect: good special effects; beautiful and evocative settings; a couple of not-so-predictable plot twists.
On the other hand, there are those script problems.  The dialog is not what you'd call scintillating.  The best lines go to the minor characters (Sydney Bromley has a field day), whereas poor Peter MacNicol in the title role gets to say things like, ""Yes, I'm in love, but not with the princess. I'm in love with you.""  Yeccchhh!
Peter MacNicol has one of those elfin faces that makes him a natural for a part like this.  If you're doing a fantasy flick and Sam Neill is unavailable, you'd definitely want to consider Peter.  Whether the now middle-aged actor would welcome that kind of casting after playing more grown-up roles on CHICAGO HOPE and ALLY MacBEAL is hard to say.  But he's effective here and certainly looks the part.
Speaking of Sam Neill, here's where my not being a genre specialist leaves me scratching my proverbial head.  I watched the series MERLIN a while back and rather enjoyed it.  I was then pretty surprised to that series raked over the coals by fantasy lovers who posted on Amazon.com. I have no real clue why MERLIN left the fans cold, while DRAGONSLAYER seems to enthrall them.  Well, DRAGONSLAYER had a bigger budget and it shows.  Beyond that, well, I'm just not sure.
Bottom line: fantasy lovers will probably love this.  Non-fans of the genre will probably find it OK.  It's not a bad way to while away a lazy Saturday afternoon.",1068595200,6,2057,4.648199445983379

250015,5,6300214052,"In 1981, Matthew Robbins directed and co-wrote the medieval fantasy ""Dragonslayer"".  The film begins with an aging wizard, Ulrich (Ralph Richardon, who played Alexander Gromeko in the 1965 classic ""Doctor Zhivago""), busily working on spells in his home known as Kragenmoor.  Living with him are his assistant/apprentice, Galen (Peter MacNicol, in his big-screen film debut), and his groundskeeper, Hodge (Sydney Bromley).  Visitors from the far away country of Urland come to Kragenmoor seeking help to rid their land of a fierce and aging dragon.  Their king, Casiodorus Rex (Peter Eyre) made a pact with the dragon years earlier that involves semiannual human sacrifices to the dragon.  The visitors are lead by an outspoken individual named Valerian (Caitlin Clarke, in her big screen film debut).  Initially reluctant, Ulrich agrees to travel back with them to Urland to do battle with the dragon, but more visitors from Urland arrive who are lead by one of the king's soldiers, Tyrian (John Hallam).  Following an altercation between Ulrich and Tyrian, Galen decides to travel to Urland to fight the dragon himself.
The cinematography in ""Dragonslayer"" is often dark and bleak, especially with the scenes of Urland.  This creates an overall feeling of despair as that is how its citizens feel living in fear of the dragon and not knowing who the next sacrificial victim will be.  Filmed long before the availability of computer-generated graphics, the special effects in ""Dragonslayer"" are quite good relying upon Phil Tippett's stop-motion filming. The story is engaging, as are the principal characters.  Other memorable characters include Princess Elspeth (Chloe Salaman), Greil (Albert Salmi), Valerian's Father (Emrys James), Horsrik (Roger Kemp) and Brother Jacobus (Ian McDiarmid).  Some viewers may find the story slow, but plot twists and numerous suspenseful scenes (such as the selection of the next sacrificial victim, the scenes in the caves, and the ending scenes) make ""Dragonslayer"" a very entertaining film.
""Dragonslayer"" earned two Oscar nominations for Best Special Effects (Phil Tippett) and Best Original Music (Alex North).  Overall, I rate ""Dragonslayer"" with 5 out of 5 stars.

Your kids won't be wishing with all their hearts to fly with this dragon in the Land Apart, I can tell ya that right now!

250069,5,6300214052,"I grew up on the works of writers like J.R.R. Tolkien, Jules Verne and the Master of Animation, Ray Harryhausen, and so Dragonslayer was destined to become a favorite of mine because of the superb animation effects.  When I saw Dragonslayer at the theater I knew only one thing would ever top it, but it was still a book, until now.  My VHS copy is mint because I didn't want to lose this classic as I waited for the seemingly eternal release to DVD.  The whole movie from start to finish never loses its appeal for me.  The storyline, acting and special effects are all at there best.  The locations are a perfect blend of light and dark to set the atmosphere of the tale.  The characters are very believable and true to their purpose.  Todays CGI world works fine for Final Fantasy or Shrek maybe but, CGI would have destroyed the ""feel"" of the special effects in this movie.  The anticipation for this films DVD release was second only to Tolkien's world recently coming to life.
DRAGONSLAYER is the only dragon depiction that has ever been done well and it defines its own period as much as Star Trek and Star Wars defines the galaxies.  I will proudly put this one next to the master storytellers in my collection.",1066608000,70,1219,4.504545454545455
250070,5,6300214052,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for what seems like an eternity, and I had a sneaking feeling that ""Reign of Fire"" (which I slept through) would rekindle (pun intended)  interest in DRAGONSLAYER enough to force Paramount into paying some way overdue attention to it.
This is a fantastic film with a cohesive story and absolutely staggering special effects, with nary a computer in sight! The dragon in this film comes across just as nicely as that in ROF, if not better. How can it be better than CGI? Well, CGI is ultimately a soulless bunch of bits and bytes, and lacking in real tangibility. This creature was an actual physical object, which adds to the realism in a way computer graphics simply cannot. You know a lot of blood and sweat went into these effects, and it shows. Watching the dragon stalking through her cavern as she chases after the apprentice is extremely creepy, and completely believable. The baby dragons don't come off quite as good--being too small to render with ""Go-Motion"" they had to use high-tech puppets--but they are acceptable. And the climax is far better, and more satisfyingly gory, than ROF.
The FX go beyond just the dragon, though, with various bits of sorcery from the old mage and the apprentice. Of course, the special effect on occasion may have been a string, but it was a very well-hidden string, and that means alot!
The acting is strong, the soundtrack is great, and the scenery completely takes you back to the Dark Ages. DRAGONSLAYER is second only to LOTR in fantasy filmdom, and is the supreme dragon movie for the ages. Please promptly rid your collection of Dragonheart, Reign of Fire, and whatever else is out there that gives the genre a bad name, because DRAGONSLAYER 'is' the genre. >>>>>>>
UPDATE: Just got the DVD and all I can say is WOW for the film (looks much better than my VHS), and BOO! to Paramount for not including so much as a trailer on this dvd. There are no extras whatsoever, which is pathetic, but that's typical of Paramount. The picture and sound are great, though.",1066348800,8,2063,4.667582417582418
250071,5,6300214052,"The great strength of Dragonslayer is it's committment and belief in the subject matter.  Never once does the director wink at the audience and throw in some campy humor.  The ambience and drama is very serious and the great cast of characters are intensely caught up in the adventure.
Some reviewers have praised the special effects, which are a welcome relief from some of the sorry digital animation we have been seeing lately.  But I want to comment on the wonderful score.  Every time Vermithrax (the dragon) appears there is an awesome cacophany of horns that just nails you to your seat.
All told, this is an awesome old-school fantasy film if that's your bag.  And it's far superior to the fantasy films to follow like Legend, Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.
I'm buying this for nostalgia's sake, but something tells me my eleven year old daughter will add it to her favorites list.",1060473600,,886,4.764705882352941
250072,5,6300214052,"I am in my late twenties, and I remember when this movie came out when I was a young child...I was completely enthralled with it. To this day it is the most realistic dragon I have ever seen in a fantasy film...most newer movies, in my honest opinion use digital special effects TOO much...you can get fast action sequences that way-but you lose the ""real"" feeling of the dragon. I personally feel that digital characters and sequences are best used with a very light hand for the best effect. In the close up shots of the dragon in Dragonslayer, you see every slimy scale, the facial expressions...and it looks real. This was not a digital image...this was old fashioned puppeteering and sculpting of a creature that looks as if it is really living and breathing.
 The story is a good one...with beautiful costuming, breathtaking backgrounds, and a nice soundtrack. There are some very memorable lines, some good action, and the underlying story of magic vs. Christianity. There is also cameo by Ian McDiarmid as well-most often known as the Emperor/Senator Palpatine from the Star Wars movies-where he plays a Christian Holy Man who faces the dragon.
 This was a favorite movie of mine as a child, and I actually married a man who ended up being just as enthralled with it as I was...we have our vhs copy viewed to the point of it almost falling apart-I am thrilled that it is finally being released on dvd.
 If you are a sci-fi and fantasy movie lover...please add this one to your collection!",1060387200,31,1496,4.702290076335878

Should look and sound nice digitally.  This is an example of why DVD is such a cool format, this flick came out in '81 and you can watch it the way it looked in the theater (if not better).

250074,5,6300214052,"I can remember watching DRAGONSLAYER in the movie theatres during my high school years, and, as I understand it, the DVD transfer is going to be upgraded from what was released on Laser Disc not long after the film's theatrical run.
This has always been one of my favorite stories to come out of the Great (19)Eighties of film.  The Go-Motion Effects by ILM were at the beginning of their use in feature films, but that doesn't stop this dragon from crawling around caves in search of the inadvertant hero sent to serve as slayer.  Also, the flying sequences clearly influenced the effects of later films (DRAGONHEART, REIGN OF FIRE, etc.).  As a matter of fact, among my circle of friends, I don't know of a ""dragon"" picture, per se, that doesn't warrant comparisons back to DRAGONSLAYER.
One great dragon.  One great sorcerer.  One great hero.  And one great (surprise, surprise!) sidekick (of sorts).
DRAGONSLAYER is one great film.",1059609600,4,935,4.849056603773585
250075,5,6300214052,"The 80s were a curious era for fantasy movies. After ""Star Wars"", the public seemed ready for stories featuring imaginative qualities. (Star Wars itself is a fairy tale thinly disguised as science fiction). ""Conan the Barbarian"" also helped make pseudo-historical stories about ancient times popular.
And still, movie directors didn't seem to quite grasp a hold of what a good fantasy movie should contain. Of the often mediocre sword-and-sorcery affairs the 80s produced, ""Dragonslayer"" stands out.
""Dragonslayer"" is a tale of a sorcerer and a dragon that he must destroy. It is a fantasy story in the most classical sense of the word, a dark tale where good must win, but often at great expense, in this story in no less than two deaths, one of which will greatly surprise the audience. Perhaps it was the dark tone of the story that turned contemporary audience off the movie, but I regard it as its greatest asset.
The special effects might look just a little out-dated, but they still hold well for audience today. The acting is again a slight problem, just a little contrived fo the most part, with the exception of the sorcerer, performed by the great British actor Richardson. But the focus is not as much on the characters as on the atmosphere and the tale itself, particularly the great dragon herself, ancient and evil and yet having its own reasons for its actions. What emerges is not a quirky or childish movie, but a fairy tale which is not quite black-and-white in its outlook. The sorcerer's implied sympathy for the dragon underscores this element of the story.
Dragonslayer's atmosphere holds true to the darker world of old fairy tales. I recommend it warmly.",1059523200,3,1679,4.874125874125874
250076,4,6300214052,"Most anyone who is old enough to have seen this movie in the theater like I did was probably blown away by the special effects. The movie is top notch for its day and it still looks good. Contrary to other reviews, this was a big budget special effects movie, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) doesnt work for pennies, they are one of the best special effects companies in hollywood. This is a classic fantasy movie that is very dark in nature the way any good fantasy film should be. It has edge of your seat action and suspense. It is definitely worth a look.",1051747200,,560,4.3428571428571425
250077,5,6300214052,"In 1981, there came a movie from largely unknown cast and crew.  The most famous of them was Sir Ralph Richardson, who starred in several films alongside Sir John Gielgud, his best friend and contemporary knighted actor.  Despite its box-office failure, this film became a cult classic, spawning several other fantasy films in its wake and prompting others to greatness.  Peter MacNicol (who currently is on Ally MacBeal and played the eccentric art gallery worker in ""Ghostbusters II"") got his first acting goal here alongside Caitlin Clarke and Chloe Salaman, and other actors including Albert Salmi (who also was in ""Caddyshack""), Emrys James (who played Otto Frank in ""The Diary of Anne Frank""), and Star Wars' Emperor Palpatine himself (Ian MacDiarmid) continued their film careers.  Directing this film was Matthew Robbins (""Batteries Not Included"") and he wrote the script alongside frequent writing partner Hal Barwood.
I really don't know why this film failed.  The story does plod a bit, but it's a great fantasy story.  The musical score by Alex North is triumphant and reminiscent of the old 60s medieval formula.  The dragon here was created by ""Go-Motion"" by Phil Tippett (who also worked on Dragonheart!!) and it looks quite well, especially considering when this FILM WAS MADE.  The acting's not perfect, but most of the actors put in a fine job (especially Sir Ralph Richardson, in one of his last film roles).
Director Matthew Robbins directs this with a no-nonsense approach and avoids using campy humor and styles to bring you pure fantasy.  It's typical of the genre and while some of the fight scenes were staged kinda amateurishly, this is still a hidden gem of hollywood.  Watching this film, you can tell the creators didn't care for trends in the industry and wanted to please only the fantasy fans and perhaps the adventurer in anyone.  FANTASY FANS AND EVEN DIE-HARD LOYALISTS, HUNT THIS MOVIE DOWN.
While I enjoyed ""Dragonheart"" and ""Willow"" immensely, there's a certain edge to this film that I enjoyed better; while Walt Disney Pictures co-produced this film, THIS ISN'T THE USUAL DISNEY-ESQUE FILM.  There is some violence here and even some partially gritty scenes that wouldn't particularly shock the adult, but for little kids, you'll have to consider it (especially involving the death of the dragon and its young).
Overall, a hidden classic.  I'm surprised it isn't even on DVD yet!  You'd figure with all the fans out there that enjoyed this movie that they would've released it on DVD.  Perhaps they will, but until then, catch it on TV if you can or rent it.  ""Dragonslayer"" will please even the most jaded fantasy fan and if you look the past some of the mechanics of the film and its old age (even so, the dragon is still cool), you will enjoy this.  This just goes to show you that even if a movie flops at the box-office, they can sometimes rise from the ashes and become one of the greatest films of all time.",1051574400,6,2954,4.876
250078,5,6300214052,"Watching Ian McKellen in action as Gandalf in the LOTR makes me nostalgic for another great Sorcerer...Sir Ralph Richardson in Dragonslayer.  The effects may be 80's but they still play well today.  Watching Sir Ralph in action against Vermithrax Pejorative still excites.  Ride the LOTR, Harry Potter wave -- this movie is worth your [money].  For any Fantasy movie fans, it is a must own.",1041897600,,390,4.953846153846154
250109,5,6300214052,"Way before there was The Lord of the Rings ""Movies"" or the Harry Potter, ""Movies"" there was The Dragonslayer.  A few weeks ago I had rented The Fellowship, and took my 11-year-old twins to go see the Two Towers.  After the movie was over, I was in sort of a nostalgic feeling.  I told my daughters that in 1981 when their daddy was a boy, about their age.  (11) Every one in the world was into Star Wars, or other Psy Fi films.  I was hocked on Dragonslayer.
Dragonslayer is a classic in the Medieval Wizard versus Dragon type movies.  The Dragon effects are awesome, even for the 80's and still look good today. And after my daughters watched it, they were hocked as well.  So if you have that little Wizard or Sorceress in your life, ( or you are that Wizard or Sorceress) and they/you  can not get enough of the Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter Movies, well while they/you wait, for the next installments, this is one of those great movies that will fill their yearning heart.  Excellent Movies, I love it, my kids love it.  Also check out the movie Krull.",1041552000,,1061,4.340101522842639
250110,4,6300214052,"This was definitely an enjoyable movie.  The Dragon is the most impressive I've seen.  No CGI could compare, and the ILM design creates the most frightening creature I've seen in a movie of this kind (That I can recall).  For fantasy I'd rank it somewhere not too far below Willow and above DragonHeart  easily.  Sean Connery is a cool guy, but a dragon movie needs a cool dragon--not a cool voice.  Also Dragonheart was too sympathetic, Dragonslayer cuts out the BS and showcases a respectible set of action sequences with a really cool spear and, like I said, a kick butt dragon.
The key action sequence that really makes the film is actually not the climax, but instead when our hero enters the Lair and we see the beast for the first time.  The lake of fire and the revealing of the dragon is very well done, back when I was younger I would rewind it to watch over and over again.
Also the darkness of the movie, at least one step above Willow and Dragonheart but below the ones I tend not to enjoy such as Excalibur and Krull (If I remember Krull well enough), suits it well.  Dragonslayer needs that darkness just so the wonderful dragon fits in.
Dragonslayer is worth the while, and I am lucky to be one of the few young people who have heard of it.  And forgetting everything else, the move has Ian McDiarmid in it, and any friend of Star Wars is a friend of mine.",1028246400,2,1372,4.3700787401574805
250111,5,6300214052,"Dragonslayer is a well-made fantasy adventure that is as artistic and entertaining as the Lord of the Ring novels by Tolkien, and should be elavated to the level of such fine fantasy films as Excalibur and Willow. Peter Macnichols (best known for the character of the comedic lawyer John Cage in the tv series Ally Mcbeal), looks very young and plays the role of the title character. He is given the task to destroy the dragon that has been the cause of virgin sacrifices in a world of medieval wizardry and Christian pageantry. Look for Ian Mcdiarmund(the Emperor from the Star Wars films) as a sanctimonious priest wearing white. The film is excellent in its use of special effects, exotic and romantic landscapes, and music. Any fan of fantasy and fiction would agree that Dragonslayer, though not very popular, is nevertheless a magnificent film in the genre. Five Stars for action, adventure, romance and breathtaking visual effects.",1007769600,6,938,4.980891719745223
250112,2,6300214052,"Old wyrm Vermithrax terrorizes the fiefdom of Urland. Through a pact with the King, it exacts a fearsome sacrifice from the people - a  maiden to be devoured at each equinox. Instead of indulging in carnality, however, the villagers mount an effort to find a necromancer powerful enough to slay the old dragon. The band's search comes to an end many leagues from Urland - at the decrepit citadel belonging to an aging wizard, Ulrich. To the band's dismay, Ulrich falls in a skirmish, and it is his overconfident, arrogant apprentice Galen who sets out to accomplish the impossible - to slay a dragon.
Though its plot possesses an interesting combination of cliche and counter-cliche, ""Dragonslayer"" never seems to pull all of its elements into a dynamic whole. There are a few excellent performances, mostly minor roles: John Hallam's spectacular performance as Tyrian, a ruthless mercenary; Sydney Bromley as the grumpy Hodge, the old wizard's faithful servant; even Ian McDiarmid's (Emperor Palpatine) performance as a Christian priest is convincing and well-done. However, the main characters are a terrible downfall. Peter MacNicol is terrible as Galen, or in any serious role at all (the first time I ever saw him was in his role of Renfield in ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"", and that's the only way I'll ever see him). Caitlin Clarke is especially unpleasant as the gruff and masculine Valerian.
Perhaps the reason why the film fails - slowly but surely - is because it tries to unite so many tried-and-true fantasy elements, for no reason at all: it's a coming of age story, it's a tale of the end of the age of magic, of ruthless monarchs, of innocent love, etc. Each could have been done significantly better individually - and was, but elsewhere, but when brought together they combine into a soulless, drab fantasy experience.
A word must be said about the film's PG rating, which is surprising in view of all the gore, however fake-looking it may be. Just as a sampler, the viewer gets glimpses of characters dying with arrows buried in their bellies, a dead body graphically devoured by drakes, several people convincingly burning, a suicide by dagger (a la Juliet), and so on. A PG-13 seems more appropriate.
It's a sad fact, but it seems that a good deal of fantasy movies are novelties than works of cinematic art.",993600000,8,2330,4.883838383838384

250114,5,6300214052,"Dragonslayer never laughs or pokes fun at it's subject material. Many movies about this genre of sword fantasy can't mantain a belief in the story.  They end up seeming tongue in cheek. (see Beastmaster)  With Harry Potter books coming to the screen and the long awaited Ring trilogy on it's way. I hope that Dragonslayer is viewed as a blueprint on how to do  it right.  From the first scene, the first bars of the incredible soundtrack, the story never insults the IQ of the audience.  Instead it moves boldly forward with the faith that we will not only ""get it"" but will appreciate the rich texture and ambience that carries us along for the ride. A great movie for taking you out of your living room and into a place you might have imagined as a child when you thought dragons were cool because they still scared you a little bit. I'd like to see this arrive in style on DVD, the musical score and sound effects were completely original and create one of the most effective examples of how the audio embellishes the story and the mood.",988243200,4,1040,4.481481481481482
250115,4,6300214052,"Galen (a pre-pre-pre Ally McBeal Peter Mcnichol) studies magic under the tutelage of Ulric (Ralph Richardson) in the dingy confines of the dying mage's home in Craggenmore.  Ulric, nearing the end of his life foresees that an end to the age of wizardry is also at hand.  Unfortunately, soem aspects of the age of magic - namely the dragons - cling to life tenaciously, if not maliciously.  The Urland king, Casiadorus, keeps the dragon Vermithrax at bay by sacrificing young women (as long as they're from poor families) to it.  When the king's subjects, hoping to rid themselves of this lottery and the dragon at the same time, enlist Ulric's aid, the King (fearful of anything that would disturb his careful order), has the aged wizard killed.  The last of the wizards gone, it falls to Galen to rid cold, dreary and poor Urland of the Dragon.  With Ulric's amulet but also the love of Valerian, an Urland woman who had to ""become"" a man to escape the king's lottery, Galen battles both King and the Dragon.
""Dragonslayer"" is about transitions - with pagan magic giving way to a christian, faith-based society, and wizards who bend nature to their will, ceding authority to those who offer the cross and the promise of salvation for those who bend themselves. The writers miss one important element - giving the dragon, not charachter, but the hints that he and Ulric are in fact different shades of a single existence.  They are both old, crabby, tortured by age, and the remaining vestiges of an all but dead age.
""Dragonslayer"", though old, isn't exactly dated.  It excels over the weaker ""Dragonheart"" though (or actually because) lacking CGI, the FX crew had to work some wizardry of their own. Echoing Jaws and Alien, the writers keep the dragon suitably off camera for much of the movie, but seem to give up the battle by the time Vermithrax makes an entrance.  Once rising from a lake of fire, Vermithrax gets plenty of full body shots that negate his size and menace, as if, now revealed, he held no surprises.  Sometimes, there's a lull, and you think the dragon will appear out of nowhere - then cut to a shot of the dragon soaring in the distance.
The producers also get some mileage out of their actors -Richardson as the doddering Ulric, Peter Macnichol as the apprentice wizard, and alone without an accent, but also John Hallum as Tyrian, the King's evil enforcer, who brings an almost Shakespearean nuance to the role (""....but comes a doubter...!"").  Also, watch for Ian Mcdarmid (the once and future emperor of Star Wars) as a missionary who aims to banish the dragon, and Caitlin Clarke as the spunky Valerian.
But most of all, it's impossible to forget that this movie comes from a lost age of its own - the pre-CGI era, circa 1982, when we had to satisfy ourselves with such primitive and unmemorable films like E.T., Poltergeist and Wrath of Khan, and no feat of cinematography seemd beyond men.",982540800,4,2920,4.717092337917485

250118,5,6300214052,"I simply loved this movie when it came out about 20 years ago, and was happy to find it available again. It's a phenomenal story about a young  apprentice who misinterprets his Master's final instructions, and whose  ensuing arrogance thrusts him into a series of confrontations which he is  ill equipped to handle (not the least of which is with the dreaded dragon  in the title). However, the young but unlikely hero accepts the  responsibility of the repercussions of his actions, and sets out to set  things right again, despite being overwhelmed by the tasks. Peter MacNicol  is fantastic as the young apprentice Galen, and presents an entirely  different character to those played in Ghostbusters (where he became  typcast as an effette scholar) and Ally McBeal (where he is being typcast  as an effette sexually repressed lawyer). Sir Ralph Richardson is the  perfect choice for the aging master sorcerer, Ulrich, and makes you believe  in magic in a world where magic is dying out along with the dragons. The  scenery and costumes are first rate, with incredible detail to capture the  genuine feel of life in the Dark Ages (they even paid attention to the  STITCHING on the clothes! ). Finally, this is one of the last films to  utilise Ray Harryhausen's special effects, in the days before computer  graphics...and his work with the dragon when it finally comes forth for  battle is simply astounding and hair raising.",965606400,22,1428,4.928571428571429
