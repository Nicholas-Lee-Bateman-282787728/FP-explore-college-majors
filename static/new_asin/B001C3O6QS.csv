If you are a person that hates films about ""Hobbits, Vampires, Zombies,Super Heroes, and Wizards"" then this might be the film you have been looking for.  Nine months after the death of his adoptive father, Jack Davenport, a Chicago journalist, obtains some of his possessions which lead Jack to discover his past. Jack receives an assignment to do a story in Dallas, Texas. Jack leaves days before Christmas Eve and decides to stay in Clearwater, Texas, his birthplace. One of the possessions left by his adoptive father was a mysterious photograph of Clearwater's oldest churches, taken in 1963. The church has a life-sized, wood carved nativity scene with a mysterious past,",1472342400,2,723,5.067226890756302

We really, really wanted to like this movie but just can't. We were looking for a nice Christmas movie for the 1st Sunday in Advent and picked this because of the Steven Curtis Chapman & Max Lucado. It isn't that it was awful BUT - the plot moved sooooo slowly, plot points were often unclear and at the end we were all frustrated by the sheriff's treatment of the main character - clearly just a plot device to create false and unnecessary tension.",1448755200,3,603,4.383928571428571

3503919,4,B001C3O6QS,"This film is an enjoyable and interesting Christmas movie that is based on a Max Lucado story. It's one of those movies that after you watch, you think ""this could have been even better and truly been a great movie"" but still as-is, it's a worthwhile movie and an enjoyable watch.

I loved the small-town feel that was portrayed, and I loved the mystery component as this guy seeks to uncover his past. The guy playing the lead is William Moses, who I recognized as the guy that used to play Perry Mason's private investigator in the Perry Mason movies in the 80's and 90's. In some ways, he was fulfilling a similar role - except he is a journalist in this film [and isn't trying to solve a murder! ;) ]

Steven Curtis Chapman plays a guitar-playing pastor and was genuinely a joy to see and hear. The sermonizing in the movie is kept very low-key - there's not a huge amount of theology in this movie - but it just presents a message that God came for us in the person of Jesus and loves us. Key themes in the movie relate to adoption, redemption, and forgiveness.

Without giving away anything, part of the story that's revealed does involve some situations that might be too intense for younger children, so while this could be a family night movie, I'd say it should be limited to ages 10 and up.

The acting is alright (not great, but perfectly fine) and the movie definitely has a ""made for t.v."" feel.  But I've seen this movie twice over the last couple of years and enjoyed it both times. It's got a certain ""charm"" to it that many Christmas-related movies try to capture, but often don't succeed at. This one does.

It is a slower-paced movie - it's the kind of movie you just sit back and relax and take in, and not the kind you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the next big thrill.  If you look at the low reviews for this movie, you'll see most all of them are from those that didn't like the slower pace.  Personally, I like movies with a slower pace - especially Christmas movies.

Note: There are a few different DVD versions out there - the best is the newer ""Exclusive Director's Cut"" one (especially for modern tv's).  I have this one and earlier had the ""widescreen"" one.  As far as I could tell, both have the exact same amount of picture (despite Amazon showing the director's cut as 1.33 instead of 1.85) but the director's cut one is formatted better.  What I really wish, however, is that this movie would be released in HD on Blu-Ray.
