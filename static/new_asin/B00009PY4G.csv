1887862,5,B00009PY4G,"I've been really disappointed at the way MGM has treated the ""Poltergeist"" trilogy on DVD. First things first, the original was a mega-hit grossing over 70 million in the US alone and eventually grossing over 150 million in domestic/international box office receipts. So it's fair to say that MGM made a lot of money on that particular film, so why is it that it was given shoddy treatment when released on DVD? It was released only with a theatrical trailer as an extra and fans were left disappointed. The first sequel, ""Poltergeist 2"" was a decent-sized hit in 1986 grossing over 40 million in the US and like the original, had great Oscar nominated special effects. Again, this film was released only with a theatrical trailer as an extra. The least successful film of the series was the love it or hate it and in my opinion, under-rated ""Poltergeist 3"" which opened in the top 5 the first week but fell off the box office radar soon thereafter. This particular film does have its fair share of fans (I read some recent reviews that rated it higher and more favorable than the first sequel) and it is presented here, along with ""Poltergeist 2"", with only a theatrical trailer as a bonus. Why is MGM being so inconsiderate to the fans? Especially when other horror movies that weren't as popular have been released in awesome DVD editions, loaded with extras?

With that said, I must say that I'm glad to see that both of these movies are finally released on DVD. Despite the lack of extras, they are both presented in widescreen format and the picture quality on both films is excellent. Movies, especially those that are special effects heavy need to be viewed widescreen and I realize now, after watching these films for years as pan and scan on cable and VHS, how much I didn't see because of the cropping done. This is especially evident in ""Poltergeist 2"".

""Poltergeist 2: The Other Side"" was originally released in 1986 and did pretty good business at the domestic box office. Although many dismissed it as just another sequel, in my opinion, it has held up pretty good due to its elaborate and spectacular special effects and the performance of a very talented actor named Julian Beck who gives one of the creepiest performances ever in a horror movie. Although he does not get much screen time, the character of Reverend Kane, may send chills up your spine especially during that key scene in which Craig T Nelson and the sinister minister have a few words on the patio of the family's Arizona home. Kane's demeanor changes from friendly to absolutely menacing as he tries to trick his way inside the Freelings' home. Evil emanates from his stare, his voice and dialogue (""they dooon't trust you any more"" ... ""you're not man enough to hold this family together"" ..."" Let me in""... You're all gonna die!!"") and if you scare easily, he may just haunt your dreams for days and weeks and months on end.

Other highlights include the now infamous vomit creature scene that is spectacularly gory and very well done and for me, aside from Beck's chilling performance, is the highlight of this film. The hilarious (but dazzling) braces scene is outrageous but the crafty special effects team pull it off with much gusto. The film has been heavily criticized for having an unsatisfactory ending that is more Sci-Fi than horror and I agree, but I cannot deny the dazzling setting of the other side and it's wispy, cloudy environment, and the final confrontation with the Beast is quite simply spectacular. Another criticism of the film, is that it's sloppily edited and I do agree. Having seen a recent documentary on the franchise and reading some articles off various websites, there were several problems in making this film and it appears several cuts were made to the finished film which may have resulted in the film looking all chopped up. Does this missing footage still exist in a vault somewhere? I do certainly hope so as I see the makers of this film were trying to create an epic sequel and I do hope that one day we get to see this film as originally intended with missing footage restored. One can only hope but until then ... fingers crossed.

""Poltergeist 2: The Other Side"" is still a spectacular and creepy excursion into the supernatural. It is not as good as the classic original but it does offer more mysticism, mythology and fear as the main demon is personified as the ever menacing Henry Kane- although I wish Kane's background was expanded upon a bit more. The special effects are great as are some of the performances from most of the cast, again, Jobeth Williams is a scene stealer as is the slimy charmer, the vomit creature. This is one sequel that is definitely under-rated in my opinion.

""Poltergeist 3"", as previously mentioned was the only film in the franchise that did not rake in the big bucks but has since its release in 1988, obtained a rather loyal following. This second sequel, as mentioned previously, is a love it or hate it type of film. Those who hate it view it as an insult to the original and curse the film for existing. Others however, enjoy it for what it is- an imaginative ghost story set in an unconventional setting and with some very creepy and inventive mirror effects. I do give ""Poltergeist 3"" a lot of credit for trying to change things up and steer the series in a new direction.

The film's main highlight are the special effects, which have received mixed reviews, some missed the elaborate, more expensive ILM effects work that permeated the previous instalments, while others have raved at the creativity of the live mechanical effects used here. For the most part, I think the effects were successful, only in the climax do I think the effects fall short. Anyone who states today's CGI effects look better are sadly mistaken in my opinion and I find that computer generated effects are causing the downfall of horror. They have their place in film and I do think they look good in a fantasy/sci-fi element such as ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Star Wars"", ""Harry Potter"" etc, but they have no place in horror movies, at least not to the degree they are being utilized in current horror films (1999's ""The Haunting"" being the prime example). CGI effects, especially when not done right, look as realistic as video games and cartoons and they're just not scary. I have yet to see a scary movie, that was able to convince me the ghosts, werewolves or creatures that I am seeing on the screen are real. 2002's ""The Ring"" is an exception but that film did not over-use this tool. Which is why I find the live effects of ""Poltergeist 3"" so refreshing. Aside from being imaginative, they are actually 3 dimensional. The breathing door is an actual pulsating door, the crawling smoke is real smoke (or dry ice, not sure), the doubles used as characters mirror reflections are real actors. There are no floating phantasms or monsters like the earlier films which may disappoint some but you do get some creative tricks that do the job: fingers poking out of mirrors, a frozen swimming pool, a breathing door, a ghostly mist freezing everything in its path, a fantastic birth scene and the way mirrors were utilized in the film and story is chilling. This sequels main flaw is in its weak climax. Actually, who am I kidding? The ending is plain awful. Especially when compared to the original films spectacular climax. We now know that the ending was re-shot due to Heather O'Rourke's untimely passing. Gary Sherman had to re-write the ending and a body double (or ""dummy""- I can't remember which one) was used in Heather's place. So there is a valid reason why the ending feels rushed and looks uninspired but I still can't give them a break on this because even I would have been able to write out a better ending than the travesty they decided to film. As a big fan of the series, I like ""Poltergeist 3"" and have re-watched it many times however I cringe whenever I get to the last 10 minutes when Aunt Pat (Nancy Allen) enters Carole's Anne's frozen room via the window washing rig. The ending is this film's greatest and most obvious flaw (along with the constant screaming of the name ""Carole Anne"" but much has already been said about that).

Anyone wanting to add 2 enjoyable and sometimes frightening films to their DVD collection, I recommend this MGM double feature. Although lacking in extras, which is a major disappointment, both films look and sound great and  is priced just right. They're haunting additions to a classic chiller. Let's just hope MGM decides to re-release these films in a more deserving DVD edition. The fans deserve better than this.

5 stars for the transfer and for the cult status of both films, but 0 for the extras or lack thereof.",1065916800,16,8731,4.682736156351791
1887863,3,B00009PY4G,"I'm glad to have Poltergeist 2 on DVD, as it's one of the better horror sequels.  Most of the cast is reunited, and it somewhat succeeds at taking a minor point from the first film (the Native American burial ground) and creating the interesting character of Taylor, played by the late Will Sampson.
But it's Julian Beck as the super-creepy Kane that makes this one worth seeing.  You just might have nightmares after watching him do his best to cajole Carole Anne to the ""other side.""
On the flip side, the whole clairvoyant thing is overdone (Carole Anne has a connection to the spirit world, so her mother AND grandmother must have one too? Yeah...), and the ending is a pretty big letdown.
And speaking of letdowns, just try to get thru Poltergeist 3.  Poor little Carol Anne has been shipped off to Chicago to live with relatives (Nancy Allen and Tom Skeritt.  Yawn.) but Kane (played by another actor since Beck had passed away) finds her.  What then ensues are a bunch of cheap effects and ridiculous plot turns that insult rather than frighten.  As you're popping the disc out after watching (or abandoning) the film, just remember: you got the infinitely superior Poltergeist 2 for a great price!",1064966400,9,1205,4.714285714285714
1887864,5,B00009PY4G,"MGM has done an admirable job for this new Double Feature DVD. It contains both Poltergeist 2 and Poltergeist 3, both presented in Animorphic Widescreen with their original theatrical trailers. The picture and sound are as good as we're ever going to see these two films on DVD. A great value, even if you only wish to buy it for one of the movies.
POLTERGEIST 2 is the most well known sequel, having a wide theatrical release following the original movie. It had the return of the original cast, and the story was almost as creepy as the first one. POLTERGEIST 3 had a more limited theatrical release, but is widely shown on TV late at night. It is much lower budget and the special effects are truly laughable by today's standards. But, I have always loved the movie simply because it was so over the top cheesy. It was the final sequel in the Poltergeist trilogy.",1062288000,,866,4.522292993630574
1887865,4,B00009PY4G,"Poltergeist II:
Satisfying sequel to ""Poltergeist""
This Second Movie could have been slightly better, for example it could have featured more footage of Julian Beck as Kane and should have not omitted key scenes that were filmed but ended up missing due to MGM rushing Production. On a whole though I liked the Second Poltergeist Movie and was pleased with the story they dreamed up as to why the Poltergeist's attacked the Freelings in the first Movie. So many people seem to think the Second Movie is set 1 year after the first ""It is not!"" If you have reed the book you would know that Diane, Steven and the kids have been staying with Diane's mother for nearly 4 years and when Steve says ""It's been a full year"" he is referring to the fact that he has tried ""yet again"" to claim for the house disappearing and has had to wait a full year to get a response again.
I thought the ending could have been better too as that also felt rushed I mean, ""Where did Tangina go when Taylor drove off???"" She is clearly missing from the shot.
One thing I respect about II is that it made common sense and pretty much featured the original cast obviously missing Dominique Dunne who was murdered by her violent boyfriend.
Just think if this had never happened II would have been so very different as Steven Spielberg was considering doing a second Movie along with Tobe Hooper and scrapped the idea when Dominique Dunne was murdered.
The Scene in Poltergeist II where Diane Mentions Dana being away at college was filmed but was stupidly cut by MGM'S Producer on the movie, Freddie ""Jackass"" Fields who was the biggest mistake to have ever worked on this movie (he is the man directly responsible for all of the movies plot holes) Thankfully he was finally fired in 1990!
I know that a good 26 minutes of Footage was cut by him from Poltergeist II and this is why it so badly needs to be restored and re-released as a Special Edition.
I think if this version had been released back in 1986 Poltergeist II would have had very good reviews.
All of the put-downs by critics were mainly regarding chops to the Movie and script plot holes.
Poltergeist III:
""Poor Movie only worth watching for O' Rourke's last performance""
The 3rd Movie was just awful, ""I'm not even going to waste my time"".
Poor little Heather O'Rourke died during filming which was such a
tragedy.
""She was the only thing that saved this Movie from being a total
disaster""

1887866,4,B00009PY4G,"I remember when I was 6 years old and ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"" came on one of the movie channels.  I watched it with my mom and my brother and when it was all over, it was one roller coaster of a ride!  I turned into a horror movie aficionado!  It was horrifying stuff for somebody in the first grade, but I loved it!  I also learned the importance of saying no to alcohol and brushing my teeth (you'll understand when you see the movie).
Since then I've watched all three of the ""Poltergeist"" films (I don't include the one made for television) and they are an amazing trilogy.  Part one is just a classic, right up there with ""Psycho.""  Part two is more of a spritual thrill ride and you're happy to see the cast reunited.
The only reason I didn't give my review five stars is because of ""Poltergeist III.""  Hmmm, where do I begin to discuss part three... uh... well, what can I say -- it had Nancy Allen in it, and that was cool.  At least part three entertains in its own way.  Who would've thought? Ghosts in a skyscraper!  That's crazy!
I'm absolutely forever in debt to MGM for releasing all these awesome films onto DVD lately!  I can't wait for this one to come out!  It has a cool cover, and it's basically a buy-one-get-one-free deal!  Hurray!",1057881600,,1262,4.3418803418803416

1887950,4,B00009PY4G,"Despite the fact that MGM made a third installment of the Poltergeist Trilogy, Poltergeist III lacks a lot in the sense of acting and special effects.  Poltergeist 1 had tons of great special effects done by Industrial Light & Magic, and a great story line to boot.  This double feature isn't what MGM should've done, and this is the reason why I hate Poltergeist 3: the special effects were poor to say the least.  In Poltergeist 2: The Other Side, we watched Steve Freeling drinking from a bottle of Tequila and swallowing a disgusting demonic worm, thus becoming Kane incarnate.  Number two does have some good moments, however, the first Poltergeist movie delivered everything needed to become one of the great ghost stories of the 20th century.  Thus said, if you really want to watch something really good and scary, watch Poltergeist II: The Other Side rather than the third and final installment of the trilogy.  In my opinion, the directors and producers should've stopped at number two instead of going on to a third one that hasn't got anything worth while to talk about.

Watching the former first, in order of their production, provides a background without which the second would be much poorer viewing. As a stand-alone picture, III offers only a spooky new building where, for no particular reasons, strange incidents are taking place to the building and to the couple, with a teen-age daughter who are playing host to the niece of the wife.  There is no particular reason for the shenanigans, except for a strange figure who  talks about the little girl who can lead them to the light. Equally inexplicable is the presence of psychic investigator Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein), from II, who pops in and..............(can't reveal here).
At any rate, if you have seen the original Poltergeist, the second and third will make fairly good sense and be pretty good minor level entertainment. Neither is really big time movie making, II getting more colorful ""phenomena"" than III, and, of course, having the same featured casting.  In III, Tom Skerritt  plays Uncle, and handles the situation in relatively low key.

1888065,4,B00009PY4G,"Poltergeist II: The Other Side(1986) is an underrated sequel directed by Brian Gibson. The malevolent ghosts from the first film are still trying to take Carol Anne Freeling(Heather O' Rourke) hostage! Taylor(Will Sampson), a Native American shaman, tries to help the Freeling Family fight back against the evil spirits.  There are rumors that longer prints of Poltergeist II are out there and they offer a more coherent version of the story. There's a deleted ""flying toaster"" scene. Jerry Goldsmith's music score was impressive...in spurts. The ""tequila worm scene"" scared me when I saw it on TV! H. R. Giger(Alien) designed some ghastly, creepy versions of the ""Beast"" for the film. The late Julian Beck plays Reverend Kane, a humanoid version of the ""Beast"".

Poltergeist III(1988) was the last nail in the coffin. Heather O' Rourke died before the film was released. Poltergeist III is the weakest film in the series, but it's still worth watching. It has some decent acting from Tom Skerritt, Nancy Allen, and Heather O' Rourke. The film uses a lot of hard, tangible special effects and camera tricks. Most Hollywood movies in the 21st Century use CGI! Carol Anne(Heather O' Rourke) hides out in a skyscraper run by her uncle. Reverend Kane and the evil ghosts are still trying to kidnap Carol Anne! Joe Renzetti composed a minimalist, creepy music score for the film.

1888067,4,B00009PY4G,"While many sequels do not live up to the original, Poltergeist II does. It picks up weeks after the events that brought Poltergeist I to its conclusion. The family, with all the original cast, is living with their grandmother, who has the same powers as Carol Anne. When she dies, her spirit helps the family battle the evil that is stalking them, wanting another taste of the innocence of Carol Anne. The sequel adds richness to the original story, explaining how the family's home originally became haunted, while maintaining the excellent family dynamics that were established in the first movie. An excellent addition to the Poltergeist tale.

Poltergeist III, on the other hand, does not come close to living up to the first two. The original cast, except for Carol Anne and Zelda Rubenstein, was apparently felt they had done enough with the plot, and I'd have to agree. Poltergeist III has none of the rich plotline of the first two, and, most importantly, the family dynamics that made the first two so interesting and took the movies beyond the horror realm are absent.

Still, at this price, getting both movies for under $7 makes it well-worth buying, and you may have a different take on III than I. So, I recommend this collection, even if you decide that II is the only one you'll be watching time and time again.",1285286400,,1327,4.740259740259741
1888068,2,B00009PY4G,"The concept of making a ghost movie presents filmmakers with a quandry. Since you're dealing with completely unrealistic subject matter (apologies to any goofball readers who believe in ghosts), you're allowed virtually unlimited latitude in coming up with ways to present the supernatural. So, let those creative juices flow! Yet if you're going to assemble a coherent film that holds up to repeated viewings, you need to establish at least a loose set of rules governing the ghosts' actions. Otherwise, instead of a film you end up with a series of somewhat-related creepy scenes strung together.

This is the problem with both Poltergeist II and III. The second installment at least had the advantage of cast continuity and a plot that builds directly on the original's Big Revelation. It does feel like a sequel (sometimes too much; inserting clips directly from its predecessor seemed like a lazy way to frame the story). They found the perfect creepy old man to play Kane, the evil deceased preacher looking to nab poor Carol Anne, and gave him a couple of effectively spooky (and funny) scenes. Yet, one wonders if he would have had more to do if the actor had been healthy (Julian Beck was suffering from cancer during filming). They also employed some nifty gross-out effects that I remember fondly from my early teens.

Unfortunately, that's about all it's got going for it. The story just kind of ends, almost sitcom style, once Carol Anne is retrieved. Looking back on the film, the freedom allowed by the nature of the subject matter had the same unfortunate effect it has on so many filmmakers. With their imaginations allowed to run wild, no rules are established and it seems like ghosts can do pretty much whatever they want, except when it would prove too much for our heroes to overcome. The ability to posess and reanimate a living creature (think tequila worm) seems wasted if all you do with that is get yourself ingested, incubated, and then barfed up as a slimy, skin-free double-amputee goop-monster. But maybe that's just me.

Poltergeist III suffers from the same lack of discipline, although I give the filmmakers credit for doing as well as they did given the tragic demise of Heather O'Rourke before they could finish up. Even if she hadn't passed, I can't imagine this mess moving beyond saturday-afternoon cable quality. The few nifty effects involving mirrors seem to be the entire reason the movie was greenlighted, and its relation to the first two Poltergeist films is purely a marketing ploy. Change Carol Anne to Judy Sue and Preacher Kane to Random Disturbed Spirit X and the film really doesn't change much.

Again, encounters with the spooks follow no rules whatsoever; they can do whatever they want . . unless they can't. They can physically assault you . . unless they can't. They are flesh-and-blood with decaying Swamp-Thingish arms . . unless they aren't. They can trick you as perfect imitations of family members . . until they talk in evil voices, at which time their faces go all evilly too.

Yes, I know, I know . . this is how ghost movies work; they throw lots of ""spooky"" stuff at you so your date will grab your forearm in fright. At least, that's how lazy, by-the-numbers ghost movies work. Hey, my 7 and 9-year olds liked it, so that's something. And that sums up my review . . not terrible, certainly inoffensive, and strictly for the kiddies.",1283126400,,3402,4.828473413379074
1888069,4,B00009PY4G,"A lot of sequels are cynical attempts to cash in on the earlier success of the original.  Both these entries, though not nearly as good as the original, ambitiously attempt to expand and elucidate on themes explored in the original ""Poltergeist"".  Both films have their attributes as well as their flaws but they nicely complement one another.  What I liked about the second installment is it gives the Freelings a backstory and it explores the dynamic of the family unit.  The problem here it just isn't that scary.  The Vomit Creature is pretty spooky and there are other moments but not enough.  The third entry, directed by Gary Sherman who helmed one of the great unsung films of the Eighties, ""Vice Squad"", ratchets the scares nicely.  The setting has been transplanted from California to a Chicago high-rise and there's a ""Shining"" like quality to the proceedings.  The major flaw here is that the story takes on an element of incoherence at times.  This may be attributed to the passing of young Heather O'Rourke during production.  I approached these film's initially on a curiousity level and I was mildly surprised by their high quality.

P2 is a compelling and most riveting sequel.

The sequel was just as exquisit as the first, improved, tender, unique, most horrifying, a great sucessor for the first one. Carol Anne's gift for purity, her angel, smile and love for her family makes this movie unique.
The creators went far far away with the story showing us why the spirits want Carol Anne and why the house of the Freeling was damned. Great storyline, Taylor and Tangina, great duet.
The 3rd part was too decepointed, they took the most valuable treasure away from Carol Anne, her family. The story get lost in the forgiveness. The cruelty and cold of her aunt and cousin makes a fall down of the basics in the movie. Tangina can't die! She's the only link with Carol Anne background.

1888075,5,B00009PY4G,"Heeeeelp! I had never seen any of the Poltergeist movies until about a week ago, when a friend of mine persuaded me to check out the original, and I found that I really enjoyed it, and am suprised that I'd never seen. I figured it to be another overhyped eighties horro-BORE fest. But I really liked it, and when this chicky told me that she liked number two even better, I checked it out.

I got this set, which comes with both the second and third helpings. After reading reviews here, I was unsure I even wanted to watch them. Mainly because what I really liked about the first was the quality of the characters. As movies two and three have different writers and directors then the first, I was sure I would be dissapointed. However, the cast is pretty much fully intact in Poltergeist II, sans the oldest daughter, due to the fact that the actress was murdered in real life (-and fifty other cursed legends from behind the scenes-) but her character was rarely involved in the first movie anyway, so it's easy to just brush her out of the picture, and the rest are just as likeable this time around, and only slightly less convincing. The ghost takes a central form here, which changes the story alot... as an evil preacher from the early 19th century, who is caught between life and death, and has wanted the soul of one Carol Anne, ever since he fell out the portal. The actor who potrays him in is good enough to build the movie around, very creepy... so the fact that the story has changed, is alright. It works as a solid backdrop to the original story, even if a bit contrived. The indian character is the same guy from One Flew Over The Cukoos nest too, which is cool. I was pleasantly suprised with this bit also... the last scene is really cheesy, but it doesn't take away from the story, and the ghosts and imagery are still very well done, though not quite on par with Steven Speilbergs work in the original.

Now, as for three, I have to say, I don't think it's half as bad as every one else claims it is. I am picky about horror movies, and the eighties produced alot of lame and sorry excuses for such. In that vein Poltergeist III is pretty much a teen-scream late eighties horror flick. Highly evident in the terrible late eighties fashion. But, in that sense, it's actually still alot more sophisticated than most teen-scream eighties flicks. The story has zero to with the other two, really, but it does bring back Carol Anne (she died shortly after this was released, again with the curse...) This time she lives with her aunt in Chicago, and goes to a school for gifted and disturbed children. The entire movie takes place basically inside this high rise building, and creates this ""behind the mirror"" world, which is where Carol Anne is trapped this time around. Carol Annes teacher is played by a real A*hole, who blames even the most extreme paranormal activity on her. You are meant not to like him, but he's really very obnoxious, and luckily he gets dropped down an elevator shaft in the middle of the movie. Some of the dialougue is awful, for instance: the ghosts are disguised as Carol Annes cousin and boyfriend in one scene, and they walk away chuckling ""they actually thought we were them."" duh. But, still this movie held my attention ok. It has a lot of parts that are fun to make fun of, as well as some cheesy ghosts, and, by the number of times they say ""Carol Anne!"" in the movie, you could make an excellent Halloween drinking game to go along with it. I say, every time a human says ""Carol Anne"" you take one drink, and every time an evil spirit says ""Carol Anne"" you take two. Trust me, they say it a LOT! Anyway, that should merit the purchase  of this bit for eight bucks. I enjoyed both titles that are included here, and I should hope to buy the first as well, since, obviously, it's the best of the three.",1225411200,2,3856,4.435825105782793

1888083,4,B00009PY4G,"The original ""Poltergeist"" was an addictive supernatural thriller with a Speilberg flavor. Obviously, to top this original would be near impossible... and neither of these films manage to do this.

Poltergeist 2 DOES manage to capture the family humor and dynamics from the original, although the oldest daughter is missing... and never even commented about. Craig T. Nelson still breaks me up, as he rants about ""The amazing freelings, and their DISAPPEARING house"" sideshow! How Nelson get's along with the Will Samson mystic is another funny and well done feature.

Another VERY NICE TOUCH is the actor who plays the preacher ""Kane,""  a skinny and androngenous nightmare!

The end of this movie feels a bit ""forced"" and sappy, but all and all it's a strong film.

Poltergeist 3 had some very good ideas, about using mirrors and keeping the audience guessing as to what ""reality"" they are watching. Another strong point is the skeptical Psychotherapist, and his disdain for Carol Anne.

Where the movie falls apart is... no humorous family dynamic.... no Craig T. Nelson or Jobeth Williams!  Tom Skerrit is a good character, but his shallow and cold wife will annoy you repeatedly.

The special effects are HORRIBLE! Fog machines and strobe lights? Any amatuer film maker could imitate the effects of this film. When plaster casts of people come apart or decay, the animation is reminiscent of ""Gumby"" effects.

Ultimately, the movie falls apart. Even the actor who played ""Kane"" looks like an unfortunate homeless person, instead of the very creepy original.

The ending (SPOILER) is UNFORGIVABLE, as the cult leader who merged with the demonic ""beast"" is simply a pathetic old soul, wanting to be ""led to the light. Come on now!! The ""Beast"" of the Poltergeist films is angry and defiant... he is at WAR with ""the Light,"" he doesn't want  to be ""saved!!""

1888085,4,B00009PY4G,"You all can remember the splendid movie POLTERGEIST, where poor Carol Anne is kidnapped by angry ghouls and the family is terrorized by supernatural happenings. It was a brilliant film: great acting, solid script, astounding visuals, and a great ending. The film was very well crafted, and was a blockbuster in its own right and deservedly so. The sequels can't come close to the power possessed by the first, but they are still entertaining in their own merits.

POLTERGEIST II: The Other Side (3.5 stars) - This story picks up somewhat where the first one left off, with the Freelings all still in one piece (minus Dominique Dunne, who was tragically killed by her obsessive boyfriend) and looking to acquire a new home. The film opens with an interesting indian ritual, which happens to set off some events (Will Sampson is a treat to watch...it was regrettable that he died after this film was made) soon to follow. After the Freelings finally find a place to stay, it's not long before they figure out the spirits have once again found Carol Anne and, this time, we get to meet one. Seems Reverend Kane (played brilliantly by the very creepy Julian Beck. Nathan Davis kind of paled a bit compared to Beck, who is perfect for the role) and his friends want Carol Anne for some tidings of their own (namely leading them into the light, brought to the forefront in part three). The happenings in this film aren't as scary, but the worm that Craig T. Nelson vomits up after ingesting it is quite creepy (this will make you think  twice about swallowing a worm of any kind - well, except for gummi worms). The ending of the film wasn't as strong as the first, but albeit it was an okay way to end a movie that while still very entertaining (thank you cast and Julian Beck) lacked some of the power the previous installment held. POLTERGEIST II is still worth a view.

POLTERGEIST III (3.25 stars) - This film takes us into a different arena for the supernatural showdown, namely the John Hancock tower of Chicago. POLTERGEIST III has a very effective score thanks to Joe Renzetti, and some fairly decent special effects thanks to Gary Sherman, but the film lacks the power of the first and somewhat the second. But tossing the mild script and a few throw-away cast members, and you've still got an entertaining horror film. While Carol Anne is staying with her aunt and uncle (Tom Skerritt and Nancy Allen, just fine in their roles), Carol Anne soon knows that she is being pursued by Kane and his compadres, once again needing her to lead them ""into the light"". The Kane this time around (played fairly well by Nathan Davis) didn't creep me out as much, but it'll give you some shivers here and there. The supernatural happenings occur in spurts, with the glass cracking between the elevators on every floor; the hand coming out of the crack-pot psychiatrist's table and throwing the mug at the mirror; Carol Anne's ""evil"" self trying to hold her in the mirror. Once Carol Anne's niece gets into some trouble with her little crush (Kip Wentz, while admirable, didn't cut it. I never really bought his performance 100%), they are pulled through a puddle and then, one at a time, they are released in different ways which weren't creepy at all, but a little hokey. The movie steers itself into near oblivion with the meat freezer scene, but comes back to swing with the bedroom scene, and to some degree, the ice car chase scene (you'll know when you see it). Tangina's presence in the film felt awkward, and I'm not sure it made sense to put her in, but with what we have it's a fair performance. The fact that she leads Kane to the light also felt a little ""forced"", but still it was somewhat satisfying. The ending of the film was changed due to the tragic and untimely death of Heather O'Rourke, who passed away on Feb. 1, 1988. The ending has creepy bolts of lightning strike the tower with Kane's laughter heard all around. This wasn't supposed to be the ending of the film, and I was a little disappointed...but it still works despite being less effective than the endings of the first two films. POLTERGEIST III still retains some power and entertains as a whole...just don't expect a repeat of the first film.

This double feature set is worth the price of admission if you're a POLTERGEIST fanatic. Although both inferior to the original, the sequels still manage to entertain. MGM did not do the DVD feature justice by slapping a meek theatrical trailer as the only extras to both films, and they should have given us a lot more than we are left with here. But taken for what it is, entertain yourselves with these entertaining little horror ditties. Just don't expect the power the first film grasped...just good old-fashioned pocorn watchings.",1130716800,,4755,4.66388557806913
1888086,3,B00009PY4G,"Poltergeist 2 was creepy, that old man in there made it scary. It started out a little slow at first, then after that it started to pick up.  For Poltergeist part 3 I liked that one more. It just seemed scarier because here they were in the city where it seemed Carol Ann could be safe but she wasn't. The only thing though is, I know that the man who played ""kane,"" in part 2 had passed away after that movie, but for part 3 I think they could have found someone else that looked more like him. Overall if you haven't seen part 2 or 3, you might want to rent it first. If you want to buy both the movies, you can buy them both for the price of one.",1123718400,2,649,3.9166666666666665
1888087,5,B00009PY4G,"Sorry but poltergeist three was super duper cheesy, good grief. I watched the third on tv recently, but for some reason I enjoyed the third when I was a child. But now that I'm grown up I can't believe the lack of taste or creativity in poltergeist three. First of all I know it's only a movie but have some knowledge of decomposition. Remember when the shrink is pushed off the floor and dies landing on the top of the elevator, and the foster parents find him and his body is completely decomposed and all that is left is a skeleton. lol. Give the audience a little credit, how is that possible to decompose in less than a few hours. Next, I know the supernatural is not suppose to make sense but when that puddle turned into a spa and they got sucked into it. Where is the imagination. And oh my gosh when tangina turns black and the daughter rips out of the body screaming. I'd be so embarassed if I was in this movie. It's one absurd scene after another.

But poltergeist 2, is much better and more like the first. That old man kane scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. His soft voice and southern accent just gives chills to your spine, because he acts all sutble but he is really diabolical and not even alive or human.

Last but not least, the first one is great. It's very old but the little blonde hair blue eyed angel heather o rourke, makes me sad whenever I watch the poltergeist flicks because she died after poltergeist 3, of a terrible disease that killed her. She could have been saved I heard, i don't know all the details but there was a blockage in her bowels or something and she couldn't go to the bathroom, and so she passedd away, and it was a horrible painful death, and she had her whole life ahead of her. It's ironic because some say the poltergeist movies brought a certain energy, some call it supernatural phenominon and in the movies all the spirits wanted carol-ann, and in real life she was taken way too soon. It's a tragic thing. If you saw poltergeist three you can tell she was sick, because of the fluid retention in her face, giving a puffy look to her face. It's a horrible way to go, and the music in all three movies is sad, but beautiful, and always reminds me of that sweet little girl.",1117152000,2,2238,4.275943396226415
1888088,3,B00009PY4G,"Never have I had such a love/hate relationship with a movie as I do with POLTERGEIST II.  When I first saw the original masterpiece, POLTERGEIST, I was an instant raving fan!  The story, characters, special effects, score,  and of course, the house, all blended magnificantly to form one of the most truly stunning horror/fantasy films ever made.  I will not go off about how freakin cool the original is, as this is a review about the sequel.

The summer of 1986 was a trying summer for this then 12 year old boy.  I had seen a tv spot for POLTERGEIST II one night while watching television, and almost fainted at the sight of it.  I begged and pleaded with my mother to let me go see it, she of course said",1114646400,,708,4.358778625954199
1888089,5,B00009PY4G,"POLTERGEIST II  works  brilliantly. The original cast is there, and the addition of the Medicine man, and Julian Beck makes for a brilliant combination. Grandma makes the most subtlest contribution in the initial story arc, but is most apparent in the spiritual denoument.

Beck is the most malevolent character in this film, and is truly an original. For a man as talented as he is, he just makes the reverend work as a character.

POLTERGEIST III  is a weak script that works  thanks to Skerrit, and a good supporting cast.  The theme of the spirits on the other side of the mirror is worked out well. What few people seem to have noticed is just how much this theme has been worked into other horror  films.

I have enjoyed all two of these films. Heather O'Rourke works hard to make her role happen. It is very sad that she passed away before the film's release, and in true sordid PR fashion. Heathers death was milked for all the publicity they could get.

Brilliant films

1888090,2,B00009PY4G,"Collecting both Poltergeist sequels on one disc, neither Poltergeist 2: The Other Side or Poltergeist 3 could hope to live up to the original Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg classic.  The second film, featuring the return of almost the entire cast, finds the Freeling family haunted by some malicious ghosts again.  While it has some good special effects (for it's time) and some genuine scares, Poltergeist 2 lacks the creeped out atmosphere that made the original film so good, but it is better than the next sequel.  Poltergeist 3 finds the late Heather O'Rourke as the only returning cast member, this time living with her uncle and aunt (Tom Skerritt and Nancy Allen) and being chased by the malevolant ghosts once again.  This film, undoubtadly the worst in the series, lacks everything that made the original so good, and anything that made Poltergeist 2 somewhat redeemable.  There are no extras included on the DVD, but I guess that's the price to pay when you get two movies on one disc at a cheap price.",1109548800,2,1011,4.854651162790698
1888091,4,B00009PY4G,"The first ""Poltegeist"" movie was a smash hit, and naturally the producers in Hollywood saw a franchise in the making.  Close to three years after the first movie, ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"" debuted in theaters.  This first sequel was decent as a haunted house thrill ride, but the original flare of the first film seems lost.  In the original movie, we learn that the housing development the Freeling family resides in was built on top of an old cemetary, which apparently ticked off the souls interred there.  In the second movie, we are given further explanation for why the Freelings' home was particularly targeted over the other houses int he community: beneath the cemetary, directly beneath the Freelings' home was the burial site of a bizarre religious cult that committed mass suicide under the direction of an insane Reverend Kane.  Wrestling with insurance companies over the uncertain fate of their home, the Freelings (Jobeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson) have been forced to move in with Diane Freeling's mother.  Soon, the spirits from the development track down the Freeling family, in the form of a fiendish Reverend Kane (Julian Beck), and again attempt to steal away Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) to lead them into ""the light"".  The family is once again aided by the ""magical munchin"" (as said by Craig T. Nelson in this sequel) Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein) with the assistance of an Indian shaman named Taylor (Will Sampson).  The frights include Robbie Freeling's braces cocooning the poor boy and Steven Freeling ingesting a possessed worm from a bottle of tequila.  The movie culminates in a slightly hokey conclusion as the family returns to the site of their missing home from the first film.  Notably absent is the teenage Freeling daughter played by Dominique Dunne (the actress was murdered in 1983).  Apparently, the director (Brian Gibson) had originally conceived of the idea that the character was away at college, though this never made it to the theatrical version.

""Poltergeist III"" is an entirely different package.  There was a novel idea proposed with this film: what would it be like if a skyscraper apartment community was haunted?  Imagine Trump Tower being visited by the spectres from the first film.  It is an intriguing concept that was regretably executed with all the excitement of unbuttered toast.  While Heather O'Rourke and Zelda Rubinstein reprise their signature roles from the previous films, the rest of cast is new.  Carol Anne Freeling is temporarily residing with her Aunt Pat (Nancy Allen) and Uncle Bruce (Tom Skeritt) in a Chicago highrise, while Carol Anne attends a special school for ""gifted"" children.  The school's founder, Dr. Seaton (Richard Fire), shows no empathy or compassion for any of the gifted children under his supervision.  His hypnosis sessions with Carol Anne lure the demonic Reverend Kane from ""Poltegeist II"" to Chicago, and then all hell breaks loose (though not as hellish as the other entries in the franchise).  While the frightening events of the previous films transpired over the course of weeks, this plot covers a single day from beginning to end.  The Tangina character feels very different and rather hokey compared to her original depiction.  Bruce and Pat Gardner are a poor substitute for Steven and Diane Freeling.  And then there's Lara Flynn Boyle playing the Gardners' daughter Donna, an obnoxious version of Dominique Dunne's character from the first film.  The director of this film, Gary Sherman, admitted that he wanted to prove that this could be a great horror film without using the high budget special effects employed in the first two films, which is why audiences are left with clouds from subliming dry ice and reflections in mirrors not mimicking their real life counterparts.  This entry severely lacks any truly frightening scenes.  In the first movie, Tobe Hooper expertly exploited childhood fears of clowns and monsters under the bed and in the closet.  In the second movie, Brian Gibson produced gruesome images of demonic tequila worms being regurgitated, a child being engulfed by his braces, and a sinister priest.  I cannot find a single aspect of Gary Sherman's creation that taps into some primal fear.  Sure, it would be extremely disconcerting to encounter your reflection doing something you are not, but the way it is executed in this film lacks any scare.  The Reverend Kane character (this time played by Nathan Davis, since Julian Beck died after the second film) is reduced to a laughable presence here.  Even sadder is that Heather O'Rourke died during the making of this film.  A different, possibly more satisfying ending was filmed, but the studio did not like it and ordered a re-shoot.  Unfortunately, O'Rourke had passed away by this time, so in the rushed new ending we never see Carol Anne's face because it is a stand-in.  I really want to like this movie since the concept is an interesting one, and I very much enjoyed the previous two films in the franchise.  However, this production is nothing more than a ""what not to do"" as a movie director.

The films are on opposite sides of the single disk in the set.  Each comes with a menu allowing for chapter selection, language modification, and the original trailers for each film.  It is pretty bare bones as far as extras go.  Perhaps, in the future, we will be treated with a special edition set with deleted scenes including the much speculated orignal ending of ""Poltergeist III"".  However, if you are a fan of the Poltergeist franchise, this is clearly a must-own set.",1107129600,2,5574,4.996749729144096
1888092,3,B00009PY4G,"How odd that the two poltergeist sequels are on one disk. Each movie had their mixed reviews when they hit the theater but for the most part, Poltergeist II ranked better than the third and ranked almost as good as the first as far as fans and critics were concerned. Let me start with reviewing Poltergeist III. This is pretty much the weak movie of the series in terms of a trilogy though that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.  Poltergeist III had a few plot holes big enough to drive a mack truck through it and I think that people were displeased that Carol Anne was the only returning character along with Tangina from the first two movies. The special effects were somewhat laughable and the character of Kane wasn't as creepy or sinister as he was in Poltergeist II. Poltergeist III had good potential but tried too hard. Though slow at times, the movie pretty much keeps you guessing as to what will happen next and deserves to be seen once or twice. Just keep in mind that when viewing Poltergeist III, don't take it too seriously. Now on to Poltergeist II. Not only do I agree that this is better than the third installment, I also enjoyed Poltergeist II as much as the first one. My only complaint with the movie is that it was a bit short compaired to the original. There was about 26 minutes of footage taken out of Poltergeist II before it hit the theaters and according to certain websites, the lost footage contained some important scenes. Anyway, this movie picks up where the first one left off with the Freeling family moving to a new house. This time a Native American known as Taylor along with Tangina help the Freeling family fight off the evil spirits. A few things that I liked about Poltergeist II is the creepy and sinister Kane(as mentioned above)and the short yet good plot developement. Hopefully a special edition version of Poltergeist II will be released showing the lost footage. Overall, Poltergeist II is the worthy sequel of the two movies though Poltergeist III deserves a look. As far as DVD features... there are none. A behind the scenes featurette would have been nice along with deleted scenes and cast interviews. There has been an hour long documentary of Poltergeist II shown on television that talked about problems(and deaths)on the set, no kidding!",1103328000,,2302,4.6839506172839505

To this day, Poltergeist III remains one of my favorites. I'm still afraid of mirrors because of it and I'm now an adult!",1102204800,,484,4.449438202247191

1888095,4,B00009PY4G,"Poltergeist II: 4 stars

Poltergeist II: The Other Side was a pretty good film. I found it to be almost as good as the first one. We revisit the family that got spooked out of their house in the first film a year after the original took place. They're broke, and no one believes their story. So it's a good set up for interesting characters. The characters in this film were just as intriguing here as they were in the first film.

The old preacher ghost, Kane, has stuck with me since I was a kid as being one of the most scariest-looking people I have ever seen. So that alone is enough to make the movie scary. But the overall story is well written.

Poltergeist III: 2 Stars

Poltergeist III, on the other hand, is pretty much a bad film. The special effects, for the budget they had, were pretty good. I liked the concept of the mirrors in the building being the portal to the other side, as well as some of the other special effects. I liked that Kane, although played by a different actor(how unfortunate) was back. He was the creepiest thing about part II, so that was a good idea. And it was good that Carol Anne and Tangina were back. Lastly, it was a good idea to have the ghosts haunt the skyscraper.

But the original family did not return. As the story goes, they sent Carol Anne to stay with her aunt and uncle in Chicago who live in a Skyscraper. The actors who played the aunt and uncle did a decent job, but they weren't nearly as interesting as the original family of the first two films were. Lara Flynn Boyle does an alright job as the daughter of the aunt and uncle. But the rest of the actors were terrible. And this is the only movie that really shows that it was made in the 80s. The hairstyles, clothes and heavy make-up give it all away. The first two films don't look dated like this one does. And lastly, it just wasn't scary or interesting. I was bored about half-way through waiting for something exciting to happen, and it just doesn't. Most of the time we just hear Kane calling out to Carol Anne in that ""evil dead"" voice, trying to suck her into the other side. ""Carol Anne! Carol Anne!"" But nothing really happens until the last 20 minutes of the film, and even that's not that exciting.

It's too bad that Heather O'Rourke died four months before this film's release. And it's also very strange, if you remember the kind of character she was in these films. It was like she was destined for a nightmare in real life like she was in the films.

The DVD itself is pretty minimal. The picture is good, but the sound isn't in 5.1 or anything special. And the only special features are the theatrical trailers for the films (one for each film). But I'd say it was cool that they put both films on one disc, even though the third film wasn't all that great.",1093564800,,2788,4.309160305343512
1888096,5,B00009PY4G,"Reverend Kane was great in Poltergeist II. Poltergeist II was my favorite of the 3 and definitely one of the best of all time. If you have not seen it, you definitely need to buy this DVD...

1888097,3,B00009PY4G,"I thought the original ""Poltergeist"" an amazing film full of great atmosphere, likeable characters, and nicely done frights. Remember the paranormal researcher pulling his face apart in the mirror? The crawling slab of steak loaded with maggots? The corpse filled pit in the backyard? The young son counting the seconds between booms of thunder and flashes of lightening? The original ""Poltergeist"" had thrills aplenty. And then it all fell apart. Hollywood, in its inimitably greedy style, promptly laid the groundwork for a sequel. Why not? The suits knew the dupes would line up at the box office like good little sheep, willing to shell out millions of dollars for what is essentially a rehash of the original effort. Well, ""Poltergeist II"" is better than your average sequel to a smash hit, but just barely. What will really feel like a stone in your shoe is the sequel to the sequel, the heap o' screeching metal and flaming wreckage that is ""Poltergeist III."" The final entry in the series is so bad, so utterly devoid of any of the elements that fueled the success of the original, that my DVD player loudly protested--with sounds I will not recreate here--my efforts to watch it.
""Poltergeist II"" reacquaints us with the hapless Freeling family several months after the nightmare depicted in the first film. Still homeless after watching their spacious, modern abode implode into thin air, Steve and Diane Freeling (Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) along with their children Robby and Carol Anne (Oliver Robins and Heather O'Rourke), now live with Diane's mother Jess far from the tainted ghost and corpse filled suburbs. Steve now sells vacuum cleaners for a living instead of real estate, and the couple spends most of their time fighting with the insurance company over compensation for the disappearing house. Grandma Jess likes the idea of the family staying with her even as she notices Carol Anne's amazing clairvoyant powers. When Grams dies in her sleep, the nightmare begins anew as the poltergeists from the first movie track down Carol Anne. The spirits seek to find a way to the ""light"" (don't we all?), and won't rest until they get their way. Meanwhile, psychic investigator Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein) and an Indian shaman named Taylor (Will Sampson) investigate the site of the Freeling's destroyed home. It turns out that a religious zealot named Kane brought a bunch of followers out to California in the 19th century and promptly killed them in the name of utopian glory. It is the ghosts of Kane and his followers who seek the attentions of Carol Anne, with Kane himself turning up in the flesh to torment the Freelings.
We should rightly classify ""Poltergeist III"" not as a horror film but as a disaster epic. On this outing, Carol Anne (once again played by the indomitable Heather O'Rourke) turns up in a Chicago high rise where she lives with her Uncle Bruce (Tom Skerritt), her Aunt Pat (Nancy Allen), and her obnoxious cousin Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle doing her best to look like Winona Ryder). Zelda Rubinstein reprises her role as the psychic Tangina for a third time. Sure enough, weird things start happening when a nerdy school counselor hypnotizes Carol Anne and opens a doorway through which the dauntless Kane returns. That's about all that happens in this schlockfest, although director Gary Sherman tricks up this installment with lots of dry ice and mirrors that provide little in the way of chills or thrills. ""Poltergeist III"" is a cheap, cheesy movie that deserves the obscurity in which it currently resides.
Fans of the original movie will appreciate the reappearance of Craig Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Oliver Robins, and Heather O'Rourke in the second entry. I always thought some of the charm of the original came from the slightly bawdy antics and great chemistry of this cast. Nelson and Williams in particular have great presence onscreen, and truly do come off as a married couple just trying to raise their family in peace. Will Sampson's often humorous Taylor character is greatly appreciated, as is the downright sinister Julian Beck as the evil Reverend Kane. Beck's emaciated appearance and creepy accent do much to elevate this sequel from the realm of mediocrity. As for the spooky paranormal encounters, Nelson coughs up a mutated tequila worm, Robins battles his braces in the bathroom, and Williams shrieks her way through a couple more corpse scenes. Overall, ""Poltergeist II"" is good. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about ""Poltergeist III."" Nancy Allen and Tom Skerritt have the all the allure of speed bumps, Boyle grates as a giggling teenybopper airhead, O'Rourke is wooden as Carol Anne, and Rubinstein's hammy performance attains epic proportions. The effects are acceptable, but the dialogue is clumsy and the pacing slow. What really killed the movie for me were the late 1980's fashion styles seen throughout the film.
Thanks (I think) to MGM for releasing these films in their praiseworthy double feature collection. As usual, the only extras for both films are a trailer and scene selection menu. The disc presents both films in widescreen formats with excellent picture transfers. I think it would have been nice to have a commentary track with the actors for the second film; I would have liked to hear Nelson and Williams talk about their roles. Two actresses associated with the ""Poltergeist"" franchise, Dominique Dunne and Heather O'Rourke, have since died. Dunne's boyfriend murdered her after the first film and O'Rourke died during surgery. If you have seen the first film, you will probably want to watch these two as well. Just exercise extreme caution with ""Poltergeist III,"" a movie so bad it has caused extreme cranial trauma to those poor souls who watch it.",1076630400,34,5758,5.017763845350053
1888098,5,B00009PY4G,"Ok, I'll be the first to admit that in and of itself, Poltergeist II is one of the most well-plotted but weakly executed horror films ever.  The abrupt and tacked-on ending seems to be just an excuse to throw in some fancy pseudo-CGI effects, and the end scene leaves you feeling dissatisfied if not completely cheated.  But, to the infinite good fortune of the producers, a staff-employed psychic who had a hand in casting the film chose for the role of the evil Reverend Kane an actor whose bone-chilling countenance and blood-curdling voice will linger with you long after the end credits have ceased.  The masterful two to three-minutes total screen time that Julian Beck was allotted is worth the ENTIRE price tag all by itself!!!  He OWNS the screen.  As soon as he walks into frame, you can actually FEEL the impending doom and death wafting off of him in thick, smoky waves.  Reverend Kane IS death, in the flesh.  He's also my personal pick for Scariest Movie Villain Of All Time!  Oh, and Poltergeist III is pretty cool also!",1072656000,4,1035,4.679558011049724

1888100,3,B00009PY4G,"Poltergeist II is a good movie lost in a bad one. The back story to the original film is revealed and it quite good but the movie falls apart when it should deliver.
The film opens up with a Native American being given a ""spirit"" to help combat a strong presence located back on the property in which the house from the 1st film was located. He senses that the family is in trouble and goes on a search for them.
The movie eventually reveals the real reason behind the first haunting and why the Poltergeists are back again. The movies' main villain is ""The Preacher"" Kane. He will do anything to get Carol Anne back to lead him and his followers into the light.
All of this is quite interesting but the movie fails to deliver on its premise. For one, there are way too many false scares. Characters dream about being pulled underground by dead bodies. Dead bodies appear in a mirror. Dead bodies which turn out to be closet items appear. This really cheats the audience. Also, take the scene where about 50 ghosts are walking on the lawn. You look at that and get a chill but then, we never see them again. We hear some beating and stomping in the house and that is it. And another scene has a character in grave danger only for it to suddenly go away. Was he actually in trouble? When the ghosts come back, they do so through a plastic toy telephone and Heather O'Rourke delivers a weak ""They're Back"" line. No where near as chilling as ""They're here.""
The acting in this film is very good and keeps the movie from sinking. Once again, you really feel for these people. JoBeth Williams is effective but not as good as she was in the first film. Julian Beck is quite scary as Kane but he isn't given much to do and the film could have benefited from more scenes with him. Were there some scenes cut out? I would like to see deleted scenes with Kane. And of course, I still think Zelda Rubinstein was born to play Tangina and her presence is always welcome.
The ""monster"" and the ending of the film feel very rushed as if they had no time to develop them. Don't ask HG Giger to create a monster for a film that will hardly be used. And the final ""battle"" isn't much at all. It is a convoluted scene of special effects and confused editing.
There is a lot to like in this film, but you will walk away from it feeling empty, especially about the forced ""funny"" final moments. You get insight to the events from the first film but don't expect new and exciting scares.
Poltergeist III, on the ""other side"", it a bad, bad movie but it has a sort of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" charm to it.
This time, Carol Anne is living in Chicago with her Aunt and Uncle to attend a ""gifted"" school and the ""ghosts"" find her. That is the basic plot and given the fact that Kane and his followers went into the light at the end of the 2nd film, having Kane as the ""main ghost"" made this film fail.
The movie is filled with bad acting and dialogue. Tom Skerritt is just way over the top in his early scenes and gives his worse performance of his career. Nancy Allen doesn't help much and Laura Flynn Boyle was lucky she survived this mess. Then there is the dialogue, which many quotes have become part of my daily life in just the sheer silliness of it all. From ""Give Me The Necklace"" to ""I've got the knowledge and the power"" to the bloated face Tangina saying ""Outside-In"", the movie makes you laugh unintentionally many times. Oh, then there is ""The Puddle!"",""Funny, funnier"",""We won't harm you..we love you.""
While over the top, Zelda Rubinstein is the ONLY saving grace in this film. Her presence brings some of the creepiness that this movie needed. Yes, her final scene is pretty bad but here scenes in the middle of the movie are pretty good.
Poltergeist III fails on all fronts but mainly due to the fact that it needed a fresh, new idea for haunting Carol Anne one more time.",1067817600,2,3870,4.354080221300138
