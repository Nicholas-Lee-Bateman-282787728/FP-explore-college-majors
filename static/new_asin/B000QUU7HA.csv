8197797,1,B000QUU7HA,"This product is a platform to advertise Bennetts other services.  The quality of that video within the menu of 'extras' labeled ' promo material' is very good; I wanted to become an angler.  The portion on the Garmin (and I am a novice GPS user) is horrendous!  It literally is a 'hand' punching all the intuitive front features as you would on any GPS.  For example, ""I have a date with my co-worker, she lives a 1234 Main St, touch ""Address"" enter street number....""  a given, too basic! The rest of the presentation follows same approach.  No effort given to production lighting of the sample Garmin or the Bennett spokesperson that by the way interrupts every feature to inject his uncanny politically incorrect sample situations.  A dozen other features should be in the DVD to assist a user who is buying this item specifically for the unique motorcycling features of which are NOT intuitive for any seasoned car bound GPS user. Recommend new owners/GPS novices to seek the free 'google-able' small videos that GARMIN and other distributors have produced for this unit that address ' in detail' the specific features for which you bought and expect in this unit.",1256860800,,1168,4.839195979899498
8197798,1,B000QUU7HA,"Amateurish production values (the narrator seems to have a garden growing out of his head) but more importantly doesn't tell you much of anything past how to turn it on and set it up; I wanted information on routing and such, and it doesn't mention the word; nor does it tell you about synching it with your computer or any one of a lot of other things that this unit will do; Waypoints? never heard of them.  Absolutely, in my opinion, quick and dirty junk.",1239667200,2,458,4.3882352941176475
8197799,2,B000QUU7HA,"It gets two stars because its better than nothing, but not by much.  The chapters advance more or less randomly, sometimes repeating, sometimes skipping ahead or backward and the information is no more than you would discover in a single half-hour of exploring on your own.  No useful tips or inside explanations, just a slim and uninteresting overview.",1217376000,,353,5.068965517241379
