The style of VH's playing, the flexibility, quickness and dexterity in his fingers is truly remarkable.  It nearly brings tears of joy to watch this octogenarian perform one of, if not THE best piano concertos ever composed - by, of course, the Master composer himself.  Unfortunately, I only have this on VHS and wish it again were available on DVD because I am afraid I will wear out the tape.  Highly recommended for any lover of Mozart.",1360540800,,542,4.8478260869565215
8260680,5,B00161BOL6,"This recording session of Horowitz playing Mozart became a major musical event. Not only do we get to see Horowitz playing Mozart's 23rd Piano Concerto, but we also see the media frenzy that took place once it was announced that Horowitz would allow this recording session to be filmed.

We see Horowitz and his wife Wanda (daughter of Arturo Tuscanini) interviewed by a hoard of reporters representing international musical publications. This interview gives us a revealing look at this musical genius and his relationship with Wanda.
  But the highlight of the film is watching Horowitz listen to a playback of the 2nd movement of Mozart's 23rd Piano concerto in the control booth.
I realized that I had never fully understood the genius of Mozart before watching Horowitz listen to this astounding 2nd movement.

This is a must see film for all fans of Mozart and Vladimir Horowitz.
After seeing it, you will be certain to gain a greater understanding of both men and their genius.
I highly recommend this 5 star masterpiece.",1247616000,2,1028,4.959302325581396
