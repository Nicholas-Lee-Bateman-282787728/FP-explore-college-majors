8425322,1,B004DHF3SK,It says this was released in 2010 but the video looks like it is from 1980. The video quality is very low. The information I guess is good if you can ignore the cheesy music and bad video. This was definitely not made in 2010. I'm sure that there is something much better out there.,1452470400,,282,4.1454545454545455
