8147822,5,B000IZ588G,"We have these on VHS, so you can tell that we have had them for years!  We have three children, the oldest is 40!.  They watched these stories.  We also have GRANDchildren 11 and 13 that now reside on the other side of the world.  When they stayed with us, which was often due to their parents travels before they moved, they watched these OVER AND OVER!  We also have 4 GRANDaughters that live where we do.  They are staying with us over the weekend while their parents celebrate the end of the Homeschool year!  They have watched select episodes many times in the past!  They just finished watching them from beginning to end!  I don't recall what we paid for this series, but it was a major purchase for a young one-income family that included three ""little ones""!  My wife and I were agreeing together this weekend that it was ""money well spent""!",1337904000,4,850,4.461038961038961
8147823,5,B000IZ588G,"We were introduced to these movies through our public library. Our children (4.5 yrs and 2.5yrs.) wanted to ONLY get these movies once they saw the first one. All the other movies (including Disney) were turned down. We are now adding it to our personal library so we can watch them in order and anytime we want. The movies are well made and introduce all the major stories of Jesus. I would not suggest using these for a Bible curriculum, but they are great for wholesome entertainment with a powerful message. These movies focus on the how the early Christians shared the stories of Jesus before the Bible was written. We like that they show the persecution of Christians, not in a grusome way, but in full faith in our Redeemer. Our faith is worth taking a stand, both in the early days of the church and today. Our whole family would highly suggest these movies to anyone of any age. (Yes, even the adults like them.)",1235779200,16,921,4.520958083832335
8147824,2,B000IZ588G,"This DVD series for children may purport to be a good way to get children interested in the Bible, but it takes too many liberties with biblical stories and is lite fluff.  We tried to use it for our summer children's church material.  Though it was somewhat entertaining for the kids, it did little to enhance their understanding of God or the Bible.  The dvd segments are short (15-20 minutes) and need a good deal of support by people who know the Bible well and can fill in the gaps.",1227571200,4,487,4.388888888888889
