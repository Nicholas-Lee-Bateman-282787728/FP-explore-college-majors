Sean Penn's use of distant panning shots are nothing short of remarkable and convey a strong sense of emotional drive in the narrrative.  Jack  Nicholson's performance is unusually raw, almost 'nakedly passionate' and  some viewers may feel slightly uncomfortable throughout the duration of  this motion picture as a result.  David Morse's character is underdeveloped  and occassionally his passive acting style becomes frustratingly  innapropriate but he still rises to the challenge despite his obvious  shortcomings in ability.

766734,5,6304039190,"This is a story of a grieving father, Jack Nicholson, who seeks vengeance for the death of his little girl at the hands of a drunk driver. David Morse, as John Booth, has been serving time in jail for that very mistake and is also very remorseful about what he had done. Jack has been keeping tabs on when Booth is to be released and intends to kill him as soon as he can. At the Booth family home, Jack makes his move, only to discover he has forgotten to load his gun and decides to give John 3 days grace before he returns to finish the job. As for Booth, the man is torn between wanting to live and allowing the execution to take place, as it would certainly end his pain. In the three days he is given, he seeks to pick up his life to move on, and at one point almost forgets that he is slated to meet with Jack at some point. Jack in the meantime, is having his own troubles with his ex-wife and family because of his obsession with murdering Booth and spends his time with an endless parade of strippers and boozy drinkers as he tries to drown a sorrow that simply won't go away.
It is on the third day that Booth realizes what is to happen, and spends his time bidding a silent goodbye to the world, as he prepares to meet with Jack and decides he really wants to live and the chase and clash ultimately ends at the little girl's grave site. Jack is always known for his over the top wild roles, while Morse is surprising with a quiet powerful presence putting him on a par with Jack in a very different way, not as a crazed  ex-convict, but as a gentle man seeking his own redemption and a way to move on.",1391904000,,1614,4.1075949367088604

766737,4,6304039190,"Somehow I missed this film when it first came out.  Jack Nicholson in 1995 when this film was made, was only 58, but he looked older. This is what tobacco and alcohol does, just as we see it in this film.

Freddy, Jack Nicholson's character, is an alcoholic, trying to deal with the death of his daughter from a:drunken driver. He isn't dealing, he is drinking and planning revenge for when the man, played by David Morse, gets out of prison.  Freddy's ex-wife, played by Anjelica Houston, has remarried and is focused on her two sons. They are Freddy's sons but he has not seen them since the divorce. This is a film built on revenge, but it us really about hidden feelings  and jowl you cope or not with traumas in your life. Freddy's ex-wife has carried on, Freddy has not, cannot as long as the devil alcohol in his system.  A sudden incident stops him n us tracks, and, maybe, Freddy can now move on.

An interesting sidelight is the diner scene with Anjelica Houston and Jack Nicholson, were they talking about their movie life together, or their real life. It was a moving and intimate scene.

I recently showed this little gem of a movie to a friend who's been fortunate enough to have been spared life's hard knocks... so far. My friend didn't get this movie, hated it in fact.

766872,5,6304039190,"This is a great movie. With the rage of Jack Nicholson, we get fuel for the soul. I mean, has anyone has ever had a relative killed by a drunk driver, not think of revenge. Maybe over time, we would forgive, but c'mon...who hasn't at least thought about it in this circumstance? Now, think about that from the flip side. You killed someone while drinking and driving and receive a manslaughter charge, but are eligible for parole.

  Wouldn't you feel that you owed the family some sort or apology or ask for forgiveness? Then imagine it being a little child who lost their life, through no fault of their own. You can understand why the father wants revenge here. I do find it interesting, that he gives him 3 days to get his affairs in order, say his goodbyes, and I suppose, ask God for forgiveness. David Morse's character is brilliant, in the fact that he is saying how he loves his loved ones without letting them know, he may die in a few days.

  The chase scene is epic in that while half the audience wants the violator to get away, also sympathizes with the father and want him to catch the man responsible for the death of his daughter. During it, you start to feel like the father will get his revenge, and he gets off a shot and you feel that's it...sweet revenge! Until you see where he is fleeing to.

  Morse's character isn't really running at all...he goes to the little girl's grave and asks for forgiveness...then asks the little girl for her angelic help I suppose. Then comes the most amazing scene...he makes amends with the girl's father, whose anger dissipates with the tearful remorse of the perpetrator.

  This movie makes you chose one side or the other and leads you into a human discovery that can only bring tears to your eyes. Kudos the writer of this story and the actors' portrayal(s)..BRILLIANT!!!!!",1339200000,,1836,4.564024390243903
766873,3,6304039190,"Sean Penn.  He's highly regarded as one of his generations finest; some even say he IS the finest of his generation.  I don't agree (I haven't been truly moved by anything he's done outside of `Dead Man Walking') but I see why people love him.  Back in the 90's he tried his hand at directing and in 1995 he got his hands on a group of VERY talented actors and made a moderately crafted character piece called `The Crossing Guard'.  The film tells the story of a man racked with animosity and pain over the death of his daughter.  A drunk driver ran her down and is now about to be released from prison.  The father of the slain is determined to kill him.  On the flipside, the drunk driver, now reformed, is racked with so much guilt he almost welcomes death as a release from the knowing of his past actions.

As some have already noted, Penn succeeds in directing great performances (most notably from the supporting actors) but he stumbles in actually building the film itself.  The brooding atmosphere feels pale as opposed to vibrant and rich; the pacing is a drag in moments and the elongated chase sequence is a complete misfire.  That said, Angelica Huston nails her diner scene, one of the biggest emotional punches of the film, both Robin Wright and Kari Wuhrer work wonders with limited means and David Morse should have been up for an Oscar.  Jack Nicholson struggles with the more earthy elements of his character's emotional state, but he sells the anger and grief rather well.  Still, as far as the construction is concerned, this film is stale.  It meanders and winds up losing steam by the film's end.  These performances deserved a better vehicle.",1334620800,2,1666,4.622448979591836
766874,5,6304039190,"It's hard to say that we enjoyed The Crossing Guard. Even though Ebert seemed to like it, we felt it was too 90's and questioned the purpose of some of the scenes. For instance, Nicholson walking from the Jewelry store to where ever. Not really an important plot development, but OK. Penn scores big.

The performances are great, as was the depiction of a Los Angeles robbed of all soul. You might begin watching the film and assume that Nicholson is the crossing guard, but you'd be wrong. Dead wrong. As Roger noted, it isn't entirely about revenge. The Crossing Guard is about two men trying to find relief from pain and guilt based on the same tragic event. It's a film that makes the 1990's seem like ancient history; with all of the poor characters somehow living without Iphones or Google. Oh well, Penn scores big.

The Crossing Guard is worth watching for fans of: Nicholson, Penn, 1995, Los Angeles and the death thereof.

766877,4,6304039190,"The Crossing Guard marked Sean Penn's second outing as a writer and director. Even today, The Crossing Guard receives a cool reception from those who stumble upon it. While almost all agree that the film is not a masterpiece, some go so far as to say it's not even a good film. It's not perfect, it's not a masterpiece, but I can't tell you that The Crossing Guard is not a good film that proves Sean Penn is a true film director.

Jack Nicholson plays Freddy, an alcoholic jeweler whose daughter was killed some years ago by a drunk driver named John Booth (David Morse). Booth has recently been released from prison, moving into a trailer in his parent's driveway and Freddy plans to kill him. Since the death of his daughter, Freddy has nothing. His ex-wife Mary (Anjelica Huston) has re-married and his two sons call him by his first name; his nights are spent drinking and socializing in a strip club. He's hit rock bottom and has nothing worth holding on to. When Freddy finally attempts to kill Booth, he has gun troubles and tells Booth he has 3 days. Booth is still suffering from the guilt that he no longer fears his own mortality.

This synopsis makes the film sound like a cheap, conventional, and contrived thriller. There are parts of Penn's story that are contrived, without a doubt...But this a strong, character-driven piece that allowed me to slightly overlook blemishes in the story.

The film is driven by Nicholson and Morse, two vastly contrasted performances, with Morse giving a subdued performance as Nicholson immerses himself into the character, once again crating a memorable character while essentially playing a variation on himself. The fact that Sean Penn is an actor greatly helps him get great performances out of his actors. 20 minutes in there is a scene between Nicholson and Huston (who had gone through a tumultuous breakup only a few years earlier) which seethes intensity. Quite late into the movie, they have yet another scene together and it's easy to see both of them drawing from their personal history to get through the scenes correctly. While both Freddy and Booth are appropriately fleshed out, I felt that Penn didn't fully flesh out Huston's character and Jojo (Robin Wright), Booth's love interest. They felt more like devices of the plot rather than actual characters.

I do find it funny to note (due to Penn's famously hot temper) that, despite playing Booth's love interest, there is not a single scene of Wright and Morse kissing.

Penn proves himself with this film that he's a strong director and a strong writer, but he still hadn't fully matured as one. His script is ""good,"" but would not have worked as a film without the cast he chose to populate the movie. The saddest thing about The Crossing Guard is that it's not a great film, although it certainly had the potential to be just that. The contrived story, specifically the happy ending, is what killed it for me. In the end, I felt the film would've worked better as a grim story about revenge than a dark tale about redemption. There are great scenes in the film, but others that are just too forced and predictable to ignore...The paradox of Freddy in particular. I saw that coming from the very beginning of the film. The Crossing Guard has great performances, great direction, and is entertaining enough but it could've been so much more.

What's different about this film is the message: forgiveness. That's really what it's about and it's done in a touching way even though most of the characters in here are anything but nice people.

If you can enjoy a good character-development story and not get too dismayed by a depressing scene or two this movie will reward you with some intangibles that are hard to describe unless you've seen this.

Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Angelica Huston and Robin Wright make for an interesting foursome, I'll say that.

767014,3,6304039190,"Nicholson and Huston were a big Hollywood couple for well over a decade in the late seventies/ early eighties into the nineties. The relationship ended when Jack fathered a child with someone else. This knowledge enhances their performances in an otherwise average film. When these two confront each other it feels raw. It feels more like they are frustrated with each other as people rather than as actors playing a part. I didn't think anything in this film, directed by Sean Penn, was as impressive as their  brilliant performances. Freddy Gale (Nicholson) is a bitter drunk who never recovered from the death of his daughter at the hands of a drunk driver named Booth (a buff David Morse). Freddy's emotional spiral proved too much for his wife (Huston) who divorced him and moved on with her life. Freddy practically lives in a run down strip club where he spends his nights and dates the dancers. The only pleasure he gets out of  life is torturing his ex wife by bringing up their dead daughter. When he learns of Booth's release from prison, Freddy plots the murder of the man who ruined his life. Freddy lets everyone know of his intentions, including Booth. He pays him a drunken visit and gives him three nights to set things right before he comes back to murder him. The remarkable thing is that Booth is accepting of this. His life was forever ruined by this tragedy too.  In his last days Booth romances an artist named JoJo (Robin Wright Penn) and tries to tell her and his parents about the daily guilt he has been living with. Wright Penn is beautiful but after watching her embarrass herself by dancing to Salt N' Pepa you question if she was only cast because her husband wanted her in his movie. My biggest problem with this film  is Freddy's hypocrisy. His daughter was killed by a drunk driver yet he is constantly driving home drunk from the strip club. In the film's last act, when he tries to execute his revenge, he is drunk driving and endangers the life of a small child his daughter's age. It's a decent, heavy film that deals with sensitive issues and has brilliant acting from a good cast. A promising effort from Penn.",1208217600,,2150,4.62041884816754
767015,3,6304039190,"I saw brilliant movie from Penn 'The pledge' which has some similiarities to this ...a man with obsessed goal.

David kills his daughter in an dunken driving accident and comes of prison but still plagued by Guilt. The plot turns out with an ending where two people give up their irrationality and accept themselves.
  This movie potrays deep emotions traumatized souls (as all sean movies) in a symbolic way but however suffers with poor script. David is not suited for this role and doesn't play the emotions of guilt. The way he acts shows as if his personality doesn't have emotions at all. Forget guilt. The romance between David and Robert Penn is not developed properly. Surprising that the romance is not focussed in the movie when movie revolves around Jack who spends time with young girls without any drama involved.
  Inspite of poor script, Jack gives great performance..as good as it gets on would think. Jack's ex-wife plays her role with ease. The audience can get the taste of melodrama of troubled souls finding peace at the end. All in all, it is average movie with simple plot.

767017,5,6304039190,"Sean Penn (writing/directing duties and a bit more, but not acting) and Jack Nicholson team up for ""The Crossing Guard"" -- a surprisingly touching film that will stick with any viewer for quite some time. Here's the plot:

(The following contains some spoilers to the storyline, as it is a summarization of most of the film)

The Crossing Guard persists in it's somber mood almost entirely throughout. The story is a seemingly hopeless one. Freddy (Nicholson) plays a father who lost his daughter several years back, and as a result also lost his marriage. He's never even visited his daughter's grave. In short, his life is a wreck. Regardless, he refuses to let the past get a hold of him. He continues the lies and bitterness through the years, trying to push away the pain and live a normal life. Yet when he gets news of an inmate being released, things only get worse. You see, the inmate is John Booth -- the man who accidently killed Freddy's little girl by means of drunk driving. Freddy decides with practically no debate (hell, he's had years of anger to support the decision) that he is going to kill Booth. He tracks down the man (who isn't too far anyway) and after an awkward misfortune (I'll leave that near-humorous surprise for your own discovery) that prevents him from murdering Booth right away, he gives Booth three days to live. Then, after the three days are up, he's coming for him. John Booth is a bit confusing because he insists he won't call the police, and doesn't seem a bit shaken by the idea of this man killing him. He seems more sad and empty than anything. He, too, has lived a life of inner torment as a result of the accident -- although Freddy refuses to have any consideration to such things, only focusing on his blind anger. Now begins the majority of the movie: the three days in which one man awaits his death and another awaits a cold taste of revenge. This is what is so interesting about the film. We get to see the view from both ends. We follow both charaters in their mixed up and broken lives through what must be their last days. The viewer becomes almost as sad and confused as the characters. John Booth has always been (and still remains) torn apart by the accident with the little girl. He feels almost like he deserves it. He constantly struggles to find way to not only cope, but understand it all. Freddy remains ruthless and bitter about everything, only looking forward to what he feels he must do. Both men are faced with the assumptions of everyone else in their life that all is well. They know their upcoming destiny, but no one else does. These people oblivious to the madness unfolding right before them certainly seem small an unappreciative compared to the situation Freddy and John are faced with. Here, I feel Penn tried to stress how some of the ""important"" things in life are really quite insignificant. The world for both men is falling apart. As the day comes to do the deed, Freddy finds himself as an emotional wreck. He reunites with his ex-wife in a restaurant in need of a discusion after his conscience gets to him. She begins to see how the man who she thought had disapeared after the death of their daughter is still deep inside Freddy somewhere. But as fragile as the situation is, he snaps and storms out. Tonight is the night he must kill John Booth. But, on the way over, he is stopped for drunk driving. The officers want to take him in. Of course, this would be major damage to his plan, so he grabs his pistol and runs. After shaking the cops off his tail, he finally arrives at his destination: Booth's home. He is prepared to kill. But through yet another string of peculiar events, he -- with the assistance of the man he vowed to hate forever -- finds the higher reason for it all behind the tragedy. I'm not going to give this ending away, but I can assure you it is quite heart-warming and worth the wait.

The Crossing Guard is a web of pain and nihilism that life can sometimes pin on someone. And by the end, it all makes sense. Anger, apathy, love, hurt, recovery, heart-break and doing what is right are just a few examples of what this film has managed to squeeze into two hours. A truly remarkable piece. A must see for any fan of drama movies.",1122508800,2,4248,4.48578811369509
767018,5,6304039190,"This film shows what a great script and amazing actors can pull off.  Penn does an amazing job pulling everything together to project a general feeling of despair.  Few films send such a powerful emotion.

David Morse, who I believe makes every movie his is in (Green Mile, Contact, Hearts in Atlantis) much better, puts in an amazing performance as someone whose guilt is unshakable.

Jack of course is a living legend, but this is a performance that really transcends the typical greatness we have come to expect.  He really makes you feel a piece of the powerful grief he lives with, and somehow makes you laugh.

Angelica Houston is just about the only actress I have seen steal a scene from someone like Nicholson with such subtlety.  One of my favorite scenes is Nicholson and Houston in the dinner.  At the conclusion, you can almost feel the door slam on their relationship.

And Robin Wright Penn gives the best performance of her career.  Obviously the man and wife relationship helped Penn know how to best play her strengths.  The scene when Morse confesses his worst secrets to Wright is amazing.  She has few lines, but really shows volumes in her reaction.

I recently watched The Woodsman and felt that Sedgwick also did an amazing job in the same type of scene, but yet went in a completely different direction.

This film is often compared to The Pledge, and rightfully so.  In my opinion though, The Crossing Guard is by far a better film.  The fact that Penn had to wait until Mystic River to get his Oscar credit is a shame.  This movie was overlooked.",1122422400,11,1573,4.641304347826087

However, this film is a very believable and touching film about how rage and the desire for revenge can completely consume a person. It's also about the power and beauty of forgiving those who have wronged you.

I don't think the film contains a lot of cliches, in fact, I think there are many moments of fresh, believable dialogue. Especially the scenes between Nicholson and Houston. Amazing!

767144,4,6304039190,"What happens when your child is killed in a car accident by a drunken driver ? What happens when you have killed a child in a car accident when you were driving under the influence ? For one, the drunken driver goes to prison for a while which always seems to be too short for the victim's father. For two, the drunken driver develops a sense of guilt that makes him desire to die, to be killed, to disappear. For three, the drunken driver cannot develop a normal life because of this guilt that keeps him away from his forgiving parents, that prevents him from building a normal relation with anyone, particularly a love relation. For four, the father of the victim develops a desire to really take justice in his own hands, unable that he is to forgive, to accept the death of his child as an event that cannot be repaired by any action on his part. Gone is gone and bygones must be accepted as such. But even if you let the sleeping dog sleep, there is a this dog gnawing at your innards and your soul, perverting it, rotting it, destroying it, and all reason along with it. Then you embark into a chase after the killer and try to destroy him in his turn. You become kind of schizophrenic and real life disappears for this virtual mission that you think, feel and know you have been entrusted with by fate and suffering, some even say God. Vengeance is the word for it : an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. And there is a perfect meeting of the sense of guilt in the killer and the desire to kill in the father. And yet, the film comes to a positive end, comes to forgiveness and repentance. This ending is very unrealistic. Vengeance does not know any stop, any limit, any mastering force because it comes from the deepest layers of one's instincts, impulses and drives, totally unconscious in its real motivations. Guilt cannot alleviate the suffering of the other nor the suffering of the drunken driver because it comes from the deepest ethical layers of the unconscious. On one side the desire to kill because the other has killed : a false balancing justice that is fundamentally barbaric. On the other side the desire to die because he has killed and cannot accept the fact and change his neurotic if not psychotic vision of the world and himself. Sean Penn just dreams of a way out that does exist in society, among men, for most of them, but is unrealistic when the two protagonists have reached their levels of derangement, because vengeance and unabating guilt are derangements of reason and the mind. Make it a mass reaction and you have a simple cause for war. The stronger will go at war against the weaker but the weaker will become the stronger because of his massive nature and of his sense of being invaded by some undeserved injustice. Never play with vengeance : it is no toy, it brings no joy, it only brings unwarranted death and unrighteous action that prompts the desire and the will to resist, to righteously defend oneself. Then it is a vicious circle going down into hell.

767145,4,6304039190,"Sean Penn, recently winning his first Oscar for MYSTIC RIVER, directed this film, and as an actor he is vastly aware of the importance of good performances.  While the movie itself is a flawed film, one can hardly fault the performances.  The movie is about going on with one's life, even when that seems the furthest thing in mind.  Jack Nicholson in a very strong performance plays Freddy, a man who lost his seven year old daughter to a drunk driver.  After this loss, his marriage to Mary (Anjelica Huston) has fallen apart, and she has remarried a stable and nice enough man (played with restraint by Robbie Robertson).  Freddy has been living for one thing:  revenge.  Now that the driver, John Booth (David Morse) has been released from prison, Freddy wants to kill him.  Booth, however, is a changed, desolate man as well, bearing the guilt of ruining not only Nicholson's life, but hurting his loving parents (Piper Laurie and Richard Bradford) as well.  How these two face their demons is the crux of the plot.  What makes it so good are the performances.  Huston is magnificent; a scene between her and Nicholson in a restaurant late at night is devastating in how it switches from what starts out as sentimental and caring, but then turns despicably ugly.  Although not on screen much, Ms. Huston asserts her power as an actress.  Robin Wright Penn as the girlfriend of Booth has some powerful moments, although her ""dancing"" sequence is both absurd and unmeaningful.  David Morse is brilliant as John Booth, an obviously gentle man who made that horrible mistake of drinking too much and driving.  His guilt weighs heavy on his shoulders, and in the convoluted ending, he and Nicholson still make it potent.

Not a happy film by any means, but a good exercise in cinematic performance.",1096156800,10,1798,4.788961038961039
767146,1,6304039190,"What happened in this movie to turn it from art house special to probably never making it to the television circuit?  Let's begin with the title.  It was never explained why it was called The Crossing Guard. Normally the title is used in films or it will express the overall emotion or theme of the film. In Penn's ditty, it did neither. There was even an embarrassing scene when Nicholson is driving by a crossing guard giving him a look going very slowly (in slo-motion) trying to build an emotional scene.  The scene made no sense.

This will lead me to the next complaint. There was no consistency with this film. The characters were so underdeveloped that you really never had an idea what they wanted from this film or why they wanted to do this film. It felt like Nicholson was just repaying a favor for Penn. This was Nicholson's token must cry movie. I still have no clue why Anjelica Houston's character was so frigid. I did not understand any of these characters in this film. It was as if I never got to know them, yet somehow had to watch their life. Speaking of consistency, it would have been great to have some back-story in this film.

I thought that it started decently, but I would have liked to see what this family was like prior to the accident. I could have used a strong point-counterpoint. If the family were happy, going to the beach, in constant sunlight prior to the accident, then it would have provided a great start to the downfall after the accident. I would have also liked to see the relationship between Freddy and his daughter prior to the accident; it would have shed some better light as to why he was so avid on revenge and why Mary was easily able to put it behind her. Again, more consistency would have helped hold this film together easier.

Also, there really wasn't a story either.  Using the rule of following a plot from point A to B to C, this film created the sense that I had jumped exactly at the B part.  There was no A, half of the B was missing, and we were headed straight towards the C.  That confused me greatly.

I have read some reviews for this film that have praised what Penn has done to this film and story. I have no clue if these critics have seen the same film or not.

Overall, this film was a jumbled mess of horror. It reminded me of walking into a child's room looking on the floor and seeing all sorts of toys, games, clothes, and stuffed animals just lying on the floor.  I said this at the beginning of this review, and I will say it again, this film was a ""mess"".

767149,3,6304039190,"The power of film as a medium lies in its ability to connect with the audience on a visceral, emotional level.  A good film brings us into the story emotioanlly, and leaves us to ponder the inponderables long after the final credits have scrolled by.  If the film-maker insists on dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's on a thinking, intelletucal level, we wind up never being able to suspend our disbelief and much of the power of the medium is lost.
Sean Penn is a great actor.  But as a writer/director, he does not know how to extract his own personality from his work.  The description of a previous reviwer - ""self-indulgent"" is quite apt in this case.  The entire film, from the aviator glasses, the close-ups of the twirling cigarettes, the inexplicable bar-room brawls, to the wordy and wildly implausible dialogue, is smothered with Penn's heavy-handed imprints.
It's a story of redemption through forgiveness - one man must learn to forgive himself while another must learn to forgive others - and it's a worthy morality tale.  But the emphasis is definitely on the morality at the expense of the tale, and as a result our main characters, all supposedly working class stiffs, are saddled with ponderous lines that constantly threaten to collapse under their own weight.  (A typical excerpt - Woman:  All this guilt of yours is too much competition for me.  Let me know when you want life.  A few scenes later the man staggers into the woman's house, collapses on the floor, and asks:  ""What is guilt?  Define guilt.""  It has to be seen to be believed.)  And if that's not enough, the director made sure voice-over commentaries are ever available in the form of song lyrics (sometimes actually sung by characters in the film), even to the point of having a couple of random passengers on a bus, completely unrelated to the story line, carry on a conversation about contentment with material standards of life in the movie's climatic chase scene.

Of course, I do volunteer work with dying folks and help train aspiring grief counselors to deal with the traumas that life all too often brings us.  I can only assume that those who so quickly dismiss this powerful meditation on grief and remorse have yet to experience these real life emotions.  Something by Schwarzenegger may be more to their taste, or one of the ubiquitous comic book recreations we encounter most summers with cardboard characters and pseudo emotions.
Sean Penn is plumbing much deeper regions of the human psyche, and doing so with actors of rare talent, fully capable of sharing with us their heart rending vulnerabilities.  Few actors have the courage to go to the places these actors visit as they face suffering almost too great to bear.  I'm reminded of the more recent Mystic River that explores equally traumatizing events.  It was heartening to watch the joy with which Sean Penn's Academy award for his performance in that Clint Eastwood film was greeted by his fellow professionals who have long acknowledged this young man's genius both in front of and behind the camera.

Nicholson plays a jeweler obsessed with the death of his daughter 6 years ago and intent on gaining revenge on the drunk driver who killed her. However, the first scene between them is ridiculous! Nicholson comes into the drunk's trailer and the guy doesn't even act scared! He acts like he knows he's coming and he's not even surprised! Another part of the movie that just doesn't make sense is that if Jack's character is so obsessed with his daugther's death why does he spend all his time in strip clubs and making love to beautiful young girls? Penn never makes us care about any of his characters. Jack's character comes off as a selfish drunk playboy who just wants to get revenge for the hell of it. As the viewer I never felt compassion or understanding for his plight. He just seems like a guy who's out to get revenge to satisfy his own ego and not for his daughter.

The parallels with this film and Cassavetes ""Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" in style, content, pacing, etc. are too great to be mere coincidence. That Penn produced ""She's So Lovely"" (written by Cassevetes before his death) demonstrates that these parallels are no coincidence.
Both directors are ""auteurs"" in the truest sense. The great strengths they share are:
1) Excellent acting skills in addition to writing and directing skills.
2) The ability to write uncontrived DRAMA. (Harder than it sounds and even harder to get produced.) Cinema has become many things, blockbusters, special effects, mindless comedy, etc.  but it SHOULD BE drama first and foremost and here, it is.

Jack Nicholson has a part of considerable expressive range that seems well fitted both to his talents and to the kind of part that viewers expect of him -- a character on the edge of crazy, with tendencies to violence and other excesses.  Here, he plays Freddy Gale, a jewelry store owner whose 7-year-old daughter was killed by a drunk driver.  That driver, John Booth (David Morse), who has been tormented by his deed, is getting out of prison, and Freddy has vowed to kill him.  Early in the movie, he breaks into the mobile home where John is living and tells him that he has three days.  Obviously, that's a cue for tension and suspense.  Freddy is all about anger: his response to his loss has cost him his marriage to Mary (Anjelica Huston), who has remarried and taken custody of her and Freddy's other two children, and it's revealed quite early that Freddy has never in fact visited his daughter's grave.  Everything is bottled up and in his head.  The formal structure of the movie works by contrasting Freddy's world of dark, gloomy, almost subterranean bouts of drinking and paid-for sex, and the more illuminated world of Mary's home and her therapy sessions for grief-stricken folks.  The differences in palette and music and use of light is striking throughout (Vilmos Zsigmond is the expert cinematographer) , and in John's case, he seems to inhabit both world's to some extent.  Although the movie has sentimental elements, it's to Sean Penn's credit -- he wrote and directed -- that the therapy talk (which Freddy has no part in) seems as empty and ineffective as Freddy's depression and anger.  John, for his part, is not sure that he wants to live and he senses that in their responses to the child's death, he and Freddy are quite similar in some ways, although John's grief and remorse doesn't encompass harm to others.  The dream that Freddy recounts to Mary in a early-hours meeting in a diner -- the dream that gives the film its name -- makes the connection clear.  That scene in the diner is very emotionally weighty, with both actors really digging down, although I have to say that I wondered a bit about the plausibility of the resolution of that scene -- no fault of the actors, but maybe Sean Penn's writing isn't totally convincing.  But see it and judge for yourself -- it's a compelling scene.

In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll not reveal how the plot plays out, except to wonder about its plausibility too, given the characters as they have been developed.

*** WARNING -- Plot Points revealed ***

Freddy Gale has a dilemma -- he wants revenge for his 7 yr old daughter Emily's hit-and-run traffic murder but his anger is so strong it is just consuming him alive.

He knows who murdered his daughter. It's John Booth, who is in jail. That's why he can't get to him - yet.

While biding his time, the well-to-do jewelry store owner Freddy is killing time at sleazy strip joints and sensitivity group meetings, trying to talk his way out of his immense grief.

Then the hammer drops - John Booth is released from jail after serving six years. Freddy makes it very clear to Booth that he's going to kill him in a week. Freddy visits ex-wife Mary at her new house and reveals his intentions to take Booth's life. The hunt is on.

Soon, Freddy gets what he wants and catches John Booth alone in his trailer. But he fails to kill Booth because his handgun turns out to be empty.

But this John Booth is not perhaps what you expected. Although now a free man, he seems to be suffering from pangs of conscience.  John Booth tells his girlfriend that he can't just choose to live a happy and new life with her. His guilt is just too overpowering for having killed Emily in an accident.

At the second major plot point, Freddy runs away from the cops after being stopped for drunk driving, and heads straight for John Booth's trailer.

Following the prerequisite chase scene, Freddy and the wounded John Booth meet at Emily's grave and make a painful peace as two tortured souls who have nothing more to gain by killing one another.

This very watchable movie, thanks to formidable acting prowess of both Jack Nicholson and David Morse, crumbles at the very end with the uplifting but very unrealistic scene in which the two men make their peace like mature adults over a 7 year old child's grave. I'd like to believe that deep-rooted hatreds are resolved this smoothly in real life but I'm afraid they are not.
