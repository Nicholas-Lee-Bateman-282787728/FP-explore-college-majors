8048800,5,B0007M45HU,"This DVD is for anyone who works with kids in Grief, ages five through early teens. As a Christian, I have looked for a video Grief presentation for almost 15 years finding little to nothing. If you have been disappointed finding something in the ""Christian"" media, you can be assured this secular DVD covers all the bases - Denial, Anger, Barganing, Depression, Acceptance, and Hope. We have been using Trevor Romain's DVDs, which use animation, live action, and wonderful music, for the past three years. Several parents have bought a copy for themselves. This DVD has a ""live"" session where Trevor speaks directly to a group of kds; Every adult should see his talk on death and grief! NOTE: For a Divorce Recovery for Kids/Teens DVD, take a look at Trevor Romain's ""Taking the 'Duh' Out of Divorce""  Mr. Romain, keep up the excellent work.",1168300800,2,842,4.8068965517241375

If you've never read one of Trevor Romain's books or seen him relate to kids (mostly in the school environment), you have no idea what to expect out of this video.

On the recommendation of a friend, I got a copy of this DVD and was pleasantly surprised at the handling of the topic and the quality of the production.

The episode is deftly written and the 2D animation is first rate  (the blend of live and action and animated characters and environments is unique and captivating).

The story revolves around a young teen girl named Skye who is struggling to cope with her grandmother's death.  Her grandmother appears to her in a dream

and the two go flying off into the night for some discussion and reflection on the deeper truths of life and death.  Sounds boring, but isn't.  Nor is it overtly religious.

There is very little discussion of the afterlife as the focus is clearly on the living and their reaction to losing someone they love.  The grandmother offers words of wisdom that are both hopeful and inspiring.  Trevor himself offers some very practical ways for dealing with such a traumatizing event.

It s a very good show that could and should lead to deeper and more personal family discussions on death and dying.  The DVD has a decent extra's package with the best of the bunch being the segment where Trevor Romain addresses a group of kids in person on his own personal experiences with the topic (included on all the DVD's).

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who's looking for a tool to help them communicate deeper truths about this topic to their family.  It's entertaining and informative in a way that you just can't find anywhere else in the kidvid arena.
