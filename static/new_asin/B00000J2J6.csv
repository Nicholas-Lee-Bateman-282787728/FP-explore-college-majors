1231337,4,B00000J2J6,A great but tearjerking farewell for the cast of Home Improvement. The only thing that would have made it better is if all the cast (JTT) would have been there for the grand finale. A must buy for any serious or casual  fan.,929145600,3,224,4.209302325581396
1231338,5,B00000J2J6,I really loved Home Improvement! It was a great family tv show and I'm glad it had a happy ending. We'll miss the Taylors and Tool Time! This is a video that cherished for the years to come.,927590400,,190,4.026315789473684
1231339,5,B00000J2J6,Over the past year I have been watching and recording all of the episodes of Home Improvement. And I throught that as they were not going to show the Series Finale I decided to buy it. Over all Home Improvement is a great show and I was very upset when it stopped. I would strongly advise you to buy it if you love comedy.,1027987200,4,322,4.046875
1231340,5,B00000J2J6,"The film is fantastic! It's the cast's best performance to date! It's funny while also being tear jerking, and the storyline is brill. All the boys are great! Taran Smith (Mark) is fantastic & really gorgeous - so that's why I bought it really - but when I got it shipped over to the UK it is a real piece of brilliance! Get it & enjoy Home Improvement even though it's gone!",1025481600,,375,4.222222222222222
1231341,5,B00000J2J6,"I saw the last episode it was aired on ABC back in 1999.  It was excellent! This was one of Tim's best work since he first started the show back in 1991. The rest of the cast members were also unforgettable too. This show has a few surprises in it and never before seen footage and bloopers. In this show the cast comes to an emotional moment at the closing. I don't want to give anymore away so buy this now!  You will be pleased you bought this because it has non stop laughs and trills. Tim Allen is really cool so get this video today. It has lots of fun for the whole family to enjoy. So buy it, you won't regret it!",1011916800,4,621,4.0
1231342,5,B00000J2J6,"""Home Improvement"" was definitely one of the best TV sitcoms of the '90s. Even though it's been a couple years now since the series finale actually first aired on TV, I still miss it a lot! I'm glad Fox is still showing reruns and hope they release a trilogy of all the show's epsidoes out on video and DVD. Today, they just showed another rerun of the series finale and it definitely made me remember how good ""Home Improvement"" had been. So I decided to write a review on this video. This video is the actual series finale when it first aired - both parts - and it's very good. I love the whole cast - Tim Allen, Patricia Richardson, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Zachary Ty Bryan, Taran Noah Smith, etc. I think they are all talented actors and I hope to see more of JTT, Zach, and Taran in the future, Patricia, as well. ""Home Improvement"" is definitely a classic TV sitcom that is well-beloved by the world. This video (or the episode, I should say) show snipets of ""Home Improvment's"" past episodes - from the funniest to the saddest. They show snipets when the Taylor boys were younger in the beginning episodes and when they were older in the more recent episodes. And at the end, it shows the cast in their series finale ceremony - if only JTT had shown up for that! That's the only real complaint I have. JTT, one of my favorite actors, should have shown up to support the rest of his cast and TV show, even if he were busy. The announcer didn't even mention his name when he was calling off the names of the cast! Oh well. They also should have added more to this video with interviews with the cast and behind-the-sceens look. But this is still a pretty cool video and I definitely recommend it for all ""Home Improvment"" fans! :-)",1000771200,9,1736,4.394409937888199
1231343,5,B00000J2J6,"By far the funniest VHS/DVD i have owned, with a one hour feature length home improvement, and about half an hour talking to the stars, showing all sorts of bloopers. i have been a big fan of Tim allen and Home Improvent for a long time, its hard to beleive its all over. Anyone who likes Hame Improvement, or Tim Allen will love this VHS",992390400,3,338,4.2153846153846155
1231344,5,B00000J2J6,"I live in the UK and ordered this from the US and it was well worth it. This video is perfect for any Home Improvement fan i.e. ME!! or first time viewer alike. I cried buckets and laughed loads. Because over the years I felt as though I really got to know all of the cast, the behind the scenes section was great. And well, what can I say about the episode, its brilliant, its very funny and at the same time equally as sad and every time I watch it I get a lump in my throat. Its the only time I have ever cried watching a video. EXCELLENT!!",991353600,5,543,3.9454545454545453
1231345,5,B00000J2J6,"The Home Improvement, Final Episode video is by far, the funniest video I have ever owned or viewed. Being a long time fan of Tim Allen and the Home Improvement series, this wasn't a surprise. I watched it for the first time, and about 3 hours laer I stopped laughing. I watched it again, and again, and again. I am hooked on this great family film. I would hope that you could enjoy it too.",983577600,5,391,4.226666666666667
1231346,5,B00000J2J6,"This tape made me cry a little at the end. It was a good show. Earl Hindeman(Wilson),my hat's off to you. Tim Allen,great performance. Jonathan Taylor Thomas should have been on screen more than he was,but,what the  heck. Great show. But 7th Heaven is my favorite.",947980800,2,264,4.739130434782608
1231347,2,B00000J2J6,"first of all, i will say that this is enjoyable, harmless fun, and bloopers are usually the best part of any show...but having said that, there's very little else to say...the laughs are few and far between (even  in the bloopers), and the script is awkward, never deciding on whether to  be a compilation ""best-of"" episode, or a continuing  storyline...even the so-called ""behind the scenes"" is all  set-ups, so you never really feel like you get to know anything more than  you already know...tim allen is tim allen, a pretender at best, the  periferal cast does what it can, and the only talented ""son"" on  the show didn't even bother to show up (jonathan taylor-thomas)... that  should tell you something right there...i will however give tremendous  kudos to patricia richardson, who always deserved better...she should be  remembered in tv land, but something tells me that when the tally is  complete, home improvement will not be on the list...not that it was ever  bad, but it was just never anything more...",937612800,7,1017,4.91764705882353

7911812,5,B00000J2J6,What a Wonderful show Home Improvement was. On the Final episode it was very heartwarming and sad with memories through the years. The Bloopers were funny and it was a touching scene towards the end. I'm glad that I got this on video.,1431993600,,234,4.465116279069767
7911813,5,B00000J2J6,Great show! Love the Tool Time segments and the cast.,1426377600,,53,4.4

7911815,3,B00000J2J6,I misread the information on this product. I thought it was a DVD and not a VHS. I will keep it anyway. I still have a working vcr.,1357171200,,131,3.7142857142857144
7911816,5,B00000J2J6,I really enjoyed this video.  It brought back many memories of the TV series.  Tim Allen is a great actor.,1309910400,,106,4.25
7911817,4,B00000J2J6,"A great and funny series, especially the Halloween episodes but my complaint is there was never enough of the gorgeous Debbe Dunning...WOW!!!!  Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful women in this or any other universe...!  She deserved more air-time.",1130803200,,250,5.384615384615385
7911818,5,B00000J2J6,"Home Improvment is onf the best sit coms of the decade, Tim and Jill are able to accuatly display in my opinion the true meaning of family, frienship, love and togetherness while still keeping a comady style unlike anything that i have seen. The series finally brings to end a legacy of the one of the most loved television family's of the time. Tieing up all lose ends and completing the circle. Tim leaves the series with one thought that graces every mans mind. What can be given more power?",1103241600,5,494,4.5
7911819,4,B00000J2J6,"This was a great series and  ending if only Jonathan was there...  i have heard several reasons for Jonathan leaving  from the ""feud"" between him and tim allen to Jonathan wanting his character to come out gay .... whatever the reason Jonathan should have stayed  if it was the feud i would have gotten rid of allen  not thomas ..... If it were the gay thing  i would have let him come out  ( as thomas later played a gay character in  ""Common Ground"" and ""Speedway Junky"" ... other than this  i would have rated it higher",1029542400,,522,4.298969072164948
