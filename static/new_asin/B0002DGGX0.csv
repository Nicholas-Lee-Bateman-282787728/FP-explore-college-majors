8026725,3,B0002DGGX0,"""Carnage Road"" and ""Carnage: The Legend of Quiltface"" are the same film. They didn't bother to change the title inside of the film. In the newer updated Quiltface version there is an opening narrative by a man attempting to look and sound scary on a set lit with white tea candles. Apparently black candles would have blown the budget.

In this feature 4 students go to the desert to do some photography. Their driver informs them of the ""Quiltface"" legend because of possible copy right issues calling him ""Leather Face."" The movie develops two characters: the bus driver (Mack Hail) a foul mouth ex-military man and Mike (Sean Wing) a geek who claims he is not buck toothed but ""toothly challenged."" He hits on Amy (Melissa Brown) and walks around with his t-shirt tucked in.

At times the cheese was good. The overly irritating Mike and the banter between him everyone else made for a half decent ""bad movie."" However, Quiltface never took off. The killings consisted of a machete with no imagination.  Writer, producer, director, Massimiliano Cerchi couldn't make 90 minutes out of it. The camera had the shakes, even when someone wasn't getting killed. Sometimes the film quality looked like a 70's VHS transfer.

This is basically a one star film which I gave 3 stars for Mike and the cheese.

8026726,1,B0002DGGX0,"The first thing I would like to say to anyone reading this review is if you see a movie that said it was done by Brain Damage films in the store or movie rental place, do yourself a favor put it back on the self and walk away. Carnage Road: the legend of crap fits in very well with the 156+ other crap fest in Brain Damage film library, and I use the term film library loosely.

There a lot of low budget B, C, D level movies that manage to take limited resources, money, lower level actors and sub par filming equipment and still turn out an enjoyable movies that are pleasure to watch. This is NOT the case with Carnage Road.  The movie contains that special Brain Damage mixture of sub sub par acting, terrible filming, a God aweful script, horrid special effects, ugly women and costumes that look like they came from the clearance rack at a Spirits Halloween store.

The filming has the quality that similar is to a bad home movie and makes it difficult to watch at points. There is zero suspense as quiltface slowly lumbers towards the actors and should be easily visible as he is walking in an open desert area toward them, but some how the actors are unable to see him. The weapons that quiltface uses do not look the lest bit realistic and are clearly toys.
I really wish that Amazon would start letting people give films zero stars to products because this film does not deserve a single star or even a half star.",1278979200,2,1424,4.345864661654136
8026727,1,B0002DGGX0,"After watching this movie I couldn't believe I picked such a crappy movie. But thats what I get for buying a Brain Damage Film. I should have learned my lesson after watching ""Terror Toons"" a few years back...All Brain Damage films I've seen so far are fake, have bad acting, & are boring...this movie is no exception.

It starts out with a couple taking pictures in the desert where a maniac named ""Quiltface"" lives. During a love scene the woman gets axed in the back while on top of her boyfriend...and so the movie credits start.

The movie follows 4 college students heading out to the desert to shoot some photos for their photography class. The driver of their van drops them off in the middle of the desert and so begins the ""horror"" (and I use that term lightly), one by one, they fall victim to Quiltface, (who, by the way, is a super skinny guy, with a machete, and a fake looking deformed head/face).

Everytime someone dies, they either flash over to another scene, hence, showing little or no blood or when they do show someone getting killed, the machete is already in the person's head or other body part, so it looks rather cheap.

The only entertaining character is the van driver. Who, unfortunately, isn't in much of the movie, and ends up dying when he stops to take a crap. He does a decent enough acting job, and delivers much of the movie's laughs.

The back of the box, if you happen to see this movie in a store, reads that it was the ""WINNER of the B Movie Merit Award for best Villian & Special Effects"", I have to laugh at that after seeing the movie. It must have been the only movie in that category.

Also, before ending this review, I'd like to note, that the movie clocks in at only 1 hour and 5 minutes, not 1 hour and 30 minutes, like the box reads. There's not a lot of blood, there's some nudity at the beginning, and the F word flys around a lot thanks to the van driver. This is probably a movie to avoid if you don't like cheap effects and bad acting....",1157328000,3,1995,4.335120643431635

8026729,1,B0002DGGX0,"I recently viewed ""Carnage: The Legend of Quiltface"". The cover of the DVD is actually impressive. The Summary of the movie located on the back tells a good story. The good points of the movie end there. First off this movie looks like it cost $20.00 to create. the sounds in the movie are poorly done. I recently completed  an audio engineering course and could have did a better job with the sound my self,there are constant ""pops"" all over movie ( a sign of bad audio engineering) effects are poorly, poorly done, the scary parts aren't scary, and the acting was of Porn movie quality. I could not even view the entire movie. I had to turn it off due to the poor over all quality of this terrible film.
If you value your sanity do not watch, purchase, or even rent this film, you'll regret it.",1100736000,,796,4.378378378378378
