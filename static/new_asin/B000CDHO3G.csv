8097898,2,B000CDHO3G,Very one sided against the paramilitaries and Colombian government. They don't address the guerilla groups and want they you to believe is that giving to their church is the best way to help the Colombian people.,1419724800,,212,4.916666666666667
8097899,4,B000CDHO3G,"This is a great documentary about how things were in Colombia. I lived there for a year in 2008 and although some things are similar, the country overall is a lot safer and a lot more peaceful now. Let's just hope and pray it continues on the trend it is on now!",1327795200,,262,4.0576923076923075
8097900,5,B000CDHO3G,"This is a low budget documentary, but I do feel it gets the message across.  I guess Mr. Rico has never seen the film, Super Size Me or any other non-Discovery channel documentary since he was expecting it to be filmed in High Def.  I also do not think Mr. Patterson's intention was to ""make money off you"" since he was on a mission trip.  Overall, I enjoyed the film and the glimpses of Latin America it provides.",1171324800,,414,4.282051282051282
8097901,1,B000CDHO3G,"I was very disappointed with the quality (audio and visual) of the documentary, particularly considering the purchase price.  First, the interviewer's technique is not very skilled, and each individual interviewed is not asked important follow up questions.  Second, the audio and picture quality is akin to the quality that can be obtained using a $250 (or less) camcorder purchased (not on sale) from your neighborhood electronics store. Third, there is no cohesive theme between the interviews, and those interviewed tend to say the same thing.  Although the documentary deals with a particular subject, those selected to be interviewed should have been veted. In short, its worth about $5.  I didn't learn anything new about Colombia or the goings on in the country. Honestly, I've traveled throughout Latin America, and I have taken better videos (including audio quality) and come into contact with more interesting people (survivors of death squads [i.e. cleansing campaigns] and economic/ political refugees) during my Latin America travels.  Hey, maybe I should make a documentary too!

I don't want to sound harsh, but the price doesn't match the quality, which is a very big bummer. There's nothing wrong with making a quick buck, as Patterson is obviously very adept at doing (particularly since he got me for $20 of my hard earned money), but the other reviews are GREATLY INFLATED.  Oh yeah, I also should have taken note that the only other reviewer shares that same last name as the documentary's producer/star/ narrator ""Patterson"".  I don't want to sound jaded, but having read that review and watched the movie, I suspect that the other reviewer HAS to be related to the documentary's creator.  You've heard of the saying ""that he/she has a face that only a mother could love"". . . well this is a documentary that only a realtive could love.",1166400000,5,1860,5.072131147540984
8097902,4,B000CDHO3G,"Imagine a documentary film without an axe to grind.  Let the camera do the story-telling.  That's what Andrew Patterson has accomplished in ""Subtle Voices.""  He's not out to tackle the American government, the drug cartels of Columbia, or a leftist group think.  Subtle Voices represents a wholistic series of interviews to raise awareness and ask difficult questions about an even more difficult human quagmire in Columbia.  Some want a diatribe to support the current Columbian government, others want a sermon against US misguided interventionism.  Patterson does not provide either in this poignant documentary.  Instead he heightens awareness, provokes mind and conscience, and does so with a cogent and profound collage of Columbian images.  Indeed, subtle voices, cries from Columbia.",1137801600,8,791,5.588235294117647
