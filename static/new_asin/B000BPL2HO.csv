2435075,5,B000BPL2HO,"Being married to John Wayne's #1 fan, I must admit I have become his #2.  We have nearly all of the John Wayne classics (not some of his real early ones) but the rest and this fits right in with the best of them.  Love the western genre and much better than some of the stuff on t.v. these days - would highly recommend.",1204329600,,320,3.984375
2435076,4,B000BPL2HO,I order these type movies for my brother and he couldn't find the 2nd movie.  There is no documentation on the packaging that the 2nd movie is on the opposite side of the disc - which has no writing/markings.  So he thought the 2nd movie had been left out.  The movies themselves were fine and he was happy to have found the 2nd movie finally after a suggestion from me to try the other side of the disc as the only thing I could think of to try.,1189382400,,446,4.045454545454546
2435077,4,B000BPL2HO,"Packaging ""Tall in the Saddle"", one of John Wayne's best-loved 'B' westerns of the 1940s, with ""The Train Robbers"", a lesser Wayne western effort from the 1970s, is, at first glance, a strange pairing, as the films have virtually nothing in common, other than both being westerns, and both starring the Duke.

But setting aside the lack of 'common ground', if you are a Wayne fan (as I am), both films are worth owning on DVD. ""Tall in the Saddle"" (1944), with a screenplay co-written by Wayne's lifelong friend, character actor Paul Fix, and produced by future Wayne business partner, Robert Fellows, is, in truth, a murder mystery set in the Old West, as Wayne investigates the murder of his prospective employer. Befriended by crusty woman-hater Gabby Hayes (who Wayne had worked with, frequently, dating back to his 'Lone Star' quickie western days, the previous decade), he quickly finds himself up to his neck in suspects (including a too-genial 'judge', played by another life-long friend and collaborator, Ward Bond). Loaded with some of the best humor of any Duke film (after he pistol-whips a gunman expecting a shoot-out, he responds, when admonished for HITTING the man, ""Yes, ma'am, just as hard as I could!""), and some combustible sex appeal (provided by sultry Ella Raines), the film is short, fast-paced, and exciting. It even offers Wayne's vision of his future, as, when hearing Hayes described as a ""grumpy old cuss"", he replies, ""I like grumpy old cusses...Hope to live long enough to be one.""

By the time of ""The Train Robbers"" (1973), Wayne had certainly achieved that goal! Produced at the twilight of his career, as the combination of deteriorating health and a lack of good scripts were taking their toll, the film is a lightweight, if good-natured entry, of a group of gunhands (headed by Wayne), hired by sexy Ann-Margret to recover and return a gold shipment stolen by her late husband. Filmed in the era of ""The Sting"", nothing is as it seems, and the group soon finds themselves pursued by outlaws and a mysterious stranger (Ricardo Montalban), all leading up to a 'twist' ending. The fun of this movie isn't in the plot, however, but in the obvious camaraderie between Wayne and another lifelong friend and co-star, Ben Johnson, as well as with Rod Taylor (in his only teaming with the Duke), and Christopher George (in his fourth, and final appearance in a Wayne film). The chemistry between Wayne and Ann-Margret is light, and sweet-natured; she flirts, he reminds her that his saddle is older than she is! This isn't anywhere near the best of the Duke's movies, even for the 1970s, but it is likable, and the Wayne persona is as charismatic as ever.

At a really terrific price, ""Tall in the Saddle""/""The Train Robbers"" is certainly worth owning, especially if your DVD budget is limited.

The Duke STILL delivers!",1137456000,14,2849,4.892339544513457
2435078,3,B000BPL2HO,"Seems an odd mix here, a vintage Wayne film and one of his last. These films were released almost 30 years apart. Both are decent westerns, neither considered among Wayne's best, though the earlier one features Gabby Hayes and that is reason alone for aquiring.
As for the Train Robbers, it's a decent but lightweight film with fun byplay between members of the Wayne troop and Ann Margaret is certainly attractive. It does have a bit of a twist at the end. But Wayne at the end of his illustrious career is just a bit too long of tooth to carry off the potential romance angle that's supposed to exist with Margaret, as evidenced by him telling her that his saddle is older than she is.
Just wondering if we are going into a period of repackaging Wayne films ala Elvis and every song he ever recorded.",1137196800,,802,4.462585034013605

2435124,4,B000BPL2HO,"This two-sided disc brings together a pair of Westerns from John Wayne's earlier (1944) and later (1973) career, united by having each a neat twist at its end.  The first, which has strong elements of the B's not long in his past (he had broken out of them only five years earlier, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stagecoach/dp/6304696582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stagecoach</a>), finds him as Rocklin, a laconic stranger who arrives in Santa Ynez with a letter and $150 advance from local rancher Red Cardell, only to find that Cardell recently died of a case of lead in the back.  Rocklin never says in so many words that he means to find the killer, but it quickly becomes obvious that that's what he has in mind.  In the process he makes a friend in the irascible old stage driver Dave (Gabby Hayes in a classic ""sidekick"" role), meets soft-spoken Judge Garvey (Ward Bond) and faces off with spoiled youngster Clint Harolday (Russell Wade) over a poker game (and is nearly shot the next day by Clint's protective older sister, the hard-riding, straight-shooting tomboy Arly (Ella Raines)), is hired by their stepfather (Don Douglas) to investigate an alleged rustling problem from the family's Topaz Ranch, gets shot at while staying at a Topaz line camp, and excites the ire of Bob Clews (Paul Fix), his recently-released-from-prison brother George (Harry Woods), and Elizabeth Martin (Elisabeth Risdon), the strait-laced aunt of Red's Eastern niece and heir Clara (Audrey Long), as well as exposing something of the incompetence and brutality of the local sheriff (Emory Parnell).  In the end, of course, the truth is revealed and the villains (yes, there are two) get their come-uppance.  Arly's bodyguard Talla (Frank Puglia) (probably a Mexican/Indian halfbreed) is another interesting character.

The second gives us Wayne as the otherwise-nameless Lane, a former Union officer turned hired gun, who has been hired by a young widow (Ann-Margret) to help her find and return $500,000 in gold hijacked off a train by her late husband.  Supported by two old comrades from the War, Jesse (Ben Johnson) and Grady (Rod Taylor), as well as a pair of ""young guns,"" Cal (Christopher George) and Sam (Jerry Gatlin), and his protege, Ben (Bobby Vinton), he sets off for Mexico to do just that, hotly pursued by the late robber's six pallbearers and some dozen-odd ""cheap guns"" they've gathered up for support.  A violent thunderstorm and two showdowns, one of which leaves a whistle-stop town virtually in ruins, provide plenty of action, while Lane's quirky relationship with Mrs. Lowe (""I've got a saddle that's older than you are"") and the attempts of Cal and Sam to fit into the group supply human conflict, and Ricardo Montalban appears as a mysterious stranger who seems to have an agenda of his own.",1354752000,3,2855,5.1778741865509765
2435125,5,B000BPL2HO,"Great movie, love it bunches. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quicker than expected and was well packaged for protection.",1353801600,,122,5.15
2435126,5,B000BPL2HO,"I rate this 5 stars even without watching The Train Robbers. My dad had always told me The Train Robbers was one of his favorites (I think because he and every other ex-serviceman was hung-up on Ann Margret, and 'The Duke' rarely put out a stinker in his later career). But I haven't watched ""Robbers"" yet.

This review is only for Tall in the Saddle. I wanted everyone to know that it's worth the $8.00 I paid and a full 5 stars simply for this movie alone. I knew I'd enjoy The Train Robbers because me and my pop always had similar tastes. So I put it off and watched ""Tall in the Saddle"" out of curiosity, to kill a little time. I am blown away. Some times I complain after watching a movie that it was time I can't get back. I will never do that with this movie. The storyline was varied and complex, with something of a mystery or two thrown into the mix. It has a changing, evolving plotline which was done very well for a Western, where so many are just point-and-shoots.
  I had to look up the name of the actress playing Arly Harolday, because her performance was outstanding. It surprised me that I hadn't seen her before. And, as it turns out, she wasn't in very many movies. I can't imagine why not. She did have her own tv series for a while, but retired after only 13 years in 'The Business'.

George ""Gabby"" Hayes was at his finest in this pic as well, and 'The Duke' was top-notch, as ever. Very strong supporting cast for such a little known movie. I wanted to punch the Aunt in the face, she was so good at being bad--similar to the old woman in 'The Outlaw Josie Wales' early in the movie, before he saves them from the commancheros.

All in all, I'm surprised Tall in the Saddle is not on any of the 'Best of' s for John Wayne. It really is top drawer entertainment. ""Tall"" is both deep and funny. I loved the complexities of the plot and the surprises thrown in later. I won't go into the storyline, because so many have already done so, and done it well. But this was a great movie. So it's easily worth the low price for both.",1349654400,,2050,4.219387755102041
2435127,5,B000BPL2HO,"This is a good double feature of John Wayne films. The reason I got this is for 'The Train Robbers' which was cheaper getting this. There is only one disc for each movie one each side. 'Tall in the Saddle' is one of his earliest films with 'The Train Robbers' as his older ones. These two movies star Rod Taylor, Ann-Margret, Ben Johnson, Ella Raines, Ward Bond, Ricardo Montalban, plus others. If you like John Wayne, westerns or any of these actors/actresses then this double feature is for you. I would recommend this anyone.",1317859200,,528,4.627659574468085
2435128,4,B000BPL2HO,"- The outraged spinster: ""I saw you strike that poor man!""
- John Wayne: ""Yes, ma'am, just as hard as I could.""

Rocklin was the sort of blunt, no-nonsense cowboy that John Wayne often played. A stranger to Santa Inez, Rocklin promptly begins to shake the trees and beat the bushes, as he investigates the murder of the rancher who had sent for him as the new hire. 1944's TALL IN THE SADDLE happens to be one of the Duke's finest early westerns, and you could say it's because of the film's wonderful character actors or the Duke being more Duke-y than normal, but you'd be more wrong than right. TALL IN THE SADDLE is terrific mostly because of that heat between John Wayne and Ella Raines. Once you this film, you can't call me a liar.

It's rare that the Duke finds himself in a scrape he can't shoot himself out of, but romantic triangles don't have much truck with blazing bullets unless the principals are inhabiting film noir country. Rocklin is a self-avowed misogynist which makes him the ideal compadre for a grizzled, boozy, woman-despising stagecoach driver like Dave. Dave is played by ""Gabby Hayes,"" and if you know ""Gabby"" Hayes, then you know there's no western sidekick more iconic.

TALL IN THE SADDLE is graced with snappy dialogue and features several moments in which Wayne demonstrates sheer badassery. In one scene he absolutely cows a card cheat. In another, he intimidates an hombre challenging him to shuck leather out in the street. It'll take hard measures to put down a tough stud like Rocklin. Crooked counselor 'Judge' Garvey (Ward Bond) contemplates a few shifty ideas.

I mentioned Ella Raines, and this is the best I've seen her, or at least this is the role in which I find her the most appealing and attractive. You take in Raines and Wayne's combustible first encounter and you can sense the quality of the film simply elevate. Raines plays a fiery hellcat named Arleta Harolday (""Arly"" to her intimates) and she sets such a hellified first impression on Rocklin that he straightaway walks into a saloon and orders whiskey. Ms. Harolday is feisty and contrary enough to hire Wayne as a ranch hand just so she could fire him. Wayne's chemistry with Raines adds dimension to his character, establishes him as more than a rugged gunfighter. Remember what they used to say about Ginger Rogers' effect on Fred Astaire? That he gave her class, but she gave him sex appeal? Ella Raines does the same for John Wayne, at least for this one oater. Audrey Long's chaste and prim Eastern girl - the third party in this romantic triangle - has her work cut out for her. And, oh yeah, there's even some ample shoot-'em-ups, a plot swerve or two, and, finally, justice meted out, western style.

1973's THE TRAIN ROBBERS has an opening that borrows some from Sergio Leone's classic slow burn opening in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, but don't get snookered. Made in the twilight of Wayne's career, this isn't a bad movie. It's just not as good as TALL IN THE SADDLE. On the plus side, shapely Ann-Margret adds spice to a creaky plot, and John Wayne is John Wayne, still solid as ever. The widow Mrs. Lowe (Ann-Margret) hires a gunman named Lane (Wayne) to recover half a million in gold hidden in Mexico, the plunder from a train robbery some years back. Mrs. Lowe's deceased husband was one of the locomotive bandits and he managed to pass on the gold's location to her just before he croaked. Now she intends to clear his name and raise her child proper by returning the gold and earning respectability. Lane gathers four gun hands to accompany him and Mrs. Lowe to Mexico. Except that the rest of the train robbers don't aim to share their ill-gotten loot.

THE TRAIN ROBBERS is a western done by the numbers and features a veteran cast the likes of Ben Johnson, Rod Taylor, and Ricardo Montalban (as a Pinkerton agent). Ann-Margret - who had to overcome her fear of horses to do this picture - tries her damndest to register sparks, but the disparity in age between her and Wayne is too telling. Even Wayne's character observes: ""I've got a saddle that's older than you are, Mrs. Lowe."" Still, it's worth it to stick around for the surprise reveal at the end and John Wayne's hilarious reaction to it.

Five stars out of five for TALL IN THE SADDLE. Three stars for THE TRAIN ROBBERS. This is one of them double-sided discs, which I sort of resent but whatever. THE TRAIN ROBBERS side of the disc shows the film in widescreen format (16x9 2.4:1) and offers these extras: the new featurette ""Working With A Western Legend"" - stuntmen from THE TRAIN ROBBERS reminisce about John Wayne (00:10:31 minutes long); the vintage featurette ""The Wayne Train"" which is a promo piece for THE TRAIN ROBBERS (00:04:07 minutes); and the John Wayne trailer gallery which includes the trailers for THE TRAIN ROBBERS and TALL IN THE SADDLE.

The TALL IN THE SADDLE side has the same John Wayne trailer gallery.",1301270400,3,4919,4.652474108170311
