8274202,4,B0019KAQ68,"For one of these 1 hour ""documentries"" a lot is covered on this topic that may surprise many people. This is not the kind of thing that is supposed to happen here. Many of these projects have been declassified. Funny how the government even documents when it goes astray. A good program to watch for those who think that the government would never do anything sinsister to them and only has their best interests in mind. Many still wander aimlessly through life thinking that these things ""only happen elsewhere in backwards nations."" Well, when you turn your back and don't pay attention to the government, they often do what they please. Will people ever wake up?

8274203,5,B0019KAQ68,"Very good documentary about declassified US military and government activities / documents involving unauthorized chemical and medical testing on US citizens, from 1948 to the 1970's.  Very well assembled and the closing statement is profound.  Holds your interest throughout. Eye/mind opening. Highly recommended....",1297468800,2,317,6.348837209302325
8274204,5,B0019KAQ68,"Okay, so I have to say that this isn't the first source that I've seen with information on experiments conducted by the U.S. government on its citizens but that doesn't make it any less disturbing. This government has a lot of secrets and for every one that is declassified or exposed, one has to ask how many remain hidden.

This is a great documentary and well worthwhile if you are interested in this kind of thing. Actually, if you are interested in U.S. government secrets, you may want to scope out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loose-Change-9-11-An-American-Coup/dp/B002FOQY7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup</a>.
