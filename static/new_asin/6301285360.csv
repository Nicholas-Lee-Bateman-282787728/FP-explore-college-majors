8166280,5,6301285360,"Ms. Benatar provides us with 4 videos:

1)""ANXIETY"" (Get Nervous)

2)""LIPSTICK LIES""

3)""SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT""
Look for Bill Paxton as a Radio Operator and Judge Reinhold as a Wing Man pilot!

4)""LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD""

Pat also includes a short Behind the Scenes on LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD. She says she was at a turning point on what kind of music to go forth with. It definitely was a change from her and the band's earlier days. Nonetheless, this videotape should satisfy anyone who would like to see these videos again from MTV's earlier days without all the logos and crap splatterred across the screen. Enjoy!

P.S. Tape is NOT Hi-Fi but is linear stereo for those in the know.",1250985600,3,682,4.595041322314049
