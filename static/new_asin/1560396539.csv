182614,5,1560396539,"Compiling the recent two Powerpuff Girls VHS releases, ""Birthday Bash"" and ""Dream Scheme"", ""Down & Dirty"" is the second DVD compilation of the hit cartoon series to be released on the market. Featuring some of the show's best episodes, Down & Dirty"" has more too offer than it's original predecessor. As added bonus treats to viewers, the DVD contains character profiles, web links (for DVD-Rom players), a sneak preview of the new Cartoon Network series ""Sheep in the Big City,"" and an interactive Powerpuff Girls Trivia Game that can be played on your DVD player.
In watching the entire compilation, I was elated to see that my favorite villain, Princess Morebucks, was featured in three of the episodes, especially my favorite episode ""Stuck Up, Up, and Away"". Princess, who is the typical spoiled rich brat, desperately wants to become a Powerpuff Girl, however all the money in the world can buy her the superpowers she'll need to battle Townsville's legion of villains. Using witty lines (in response to Buttercup's statement that money can't buy superpowers, Princess replies ""Oh Yeah, Tell That to Batman."") and bright animation, this episode is one of the series' best.
Other great episodes include ""Birthday Bash"" where Townsville's villains unite to ruin the Girls birthday publicized birthday party, and ""Schoolhouse Rocked"" which features the Gangrene Gang and their new hangout place: Pokey Oats Kindergarten. Overall, both adults and children alike will love the Powerpuff Girls. The quality of both picture and sound is amazing on DVD, and if you haven't purchased a DVD player, please do so as soon as possible. DVD is today's most exciting way to watch films and shows and compared to VHS, the Powerpuff Girls look and sound fantastic in this digital format. ""Down & Dirty"" is a must have for any Powerpuff Girls fans!",974419200,12,1836,5.0627062706270625
182615,5,1560396539,"Townsville, Townsville...just imagine such an adorable little city all
built out of a child's blocks with one building right in the very
midst that greatly resembles a Tinkertoy - maybe it's a nice, modest
little revolving restaurant or something. What's more, Townsville must
be the most frequently rebuilt and renovated city in the whole wide
world! And guess what?  Townsville is NOT here in America - it's
actually in AUSTRALIA!  So just go and look it up on the map of The
Land of Down Below - it's right there on the northeastern coast! No
kiddin', mate!
Anyway, if you happen to be a Townsville villain -
BETTER RUN once you hear the theme song just beginning and you get
caught red-handed and with your pants down! Or else you'd end up with
your most sensitive parts being mercilessly pelted by those little
hands and feet as if they're really hard mini-sledgehammers. Ouch. At
least you'll get a chance to nurse all your bruises, welts, and other
boo-boos once you're safe and sound at the Townsville jailhouse.
And
if you happen to be a Powerpuff Girl, no one WOULD know how much
superstrength you've gotten hidden within just by looking at you -
why, you don't even have any nose, teeth, ears, fingers, or toes at
all! In fact, you look just like a doll any little girl would want for
her next birthday! And what's more, you happen to be one of those
pint-sized students at Pokey Oaks Kindergarten, believe it or not! And
how lucky you are; just drawing and coloring and playing and napping
and snacking on cookies and singing along with the Teach! Best of all,
NO HOMEWORK AT ALL!
If you're Blossom, everyone would marvel at and
envy your long, shining train of such beautiful scarlet hair that
flows behind you just like a proud torch as you courageously fly to
the rescue! And if you're Bubbles, you sure know how to enjoy your
life to the fullest as well as holding a lively conversation in
Spanish with a squirrel - much to your sister's disgusted annoyance!
Now, if you're Buttercup, it's no doubt you'd fiercely enforce all
your little muscles to deliver a punch and a kick powerful enough to
send a bad guy's teeth, sweat, and blooddrops spinning into all
directions!
And lastly of all, if you are the resident of
Townsville, your life will NEVER ever be the same again once The
Powerpuff Girls come into their very being. So you can sit back and
enjoy the show as a 100-ft. monster, a stir-crazy ape with exposed
brains preserved under the glass, a vegetarian alien, a magician
zombie, a spoiled-rotten heiress, etc. suddenly wreak havoc upon such
a pretty hometown like yours! But not to worry - your girls will
promptly show up for a big clean-up right after the party! So just
think twice before putting sugar and spice on everything nice you like
to eat, mate! So - HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, GIRLS!",969494400,8,2819,4.602385685884692
182616,4,1560396539,"This is the second of three in a series of detailed reviews from the videos comprising the Powerpuff 3-Pack.  Video:  Birthday Bash.
""Birthday Bash"":  There's nothing ordinary about the Powerpuff Girls, and their birthday party is no exception.  Despite their attempts to have a simple birthday celebration, Mojo, Princess, the Amoeba Boys, and Him have sent them presents meant to destroy them.  (Rating:  4).
""Beat Your Greens"" is the crown jewel here on how to get kids to eat their greens.  Broccoloid aliens sent a mind-control spore that infects the Farmsville broccoli supply.  Kids don't like broccoli so they don't eat it.  The attempts of one parent to coax his baby son is funny, comparing the broccoli to an X-Wing fighter, a pirate ship, etc.  The way the kids defeat the Broccoloids is creative.  ""Release the cheese!""  There's also a line taken from Apocalypse Now, which only parents might get.  Funny line from Bubbles:  ""That scared the pants off me!"" (Rating:  5).
In ""Los Dos Mojos"", the Girls are busy fighting Mojo, but Bubbles accidentally gets knocked on the head by an I-beam and wakes up thinking she's someone else.  Blossom and Buttercup soon find their sibling dressed in a familiar turban and cloak, speaking in such a way that she constantly reiterates, restate the same thing over and over, repeats everything she says.  Bubbles' manner of speaking is simply funny!  ""I am bad.  I am evil.  I am... MOJO JOJO!""  The way she taunts Buttercup--""Afraid I'll whip the skirt off you?""-- and her imitation of Mojo's laugh is also amusing.  (Rating:  5)
Elmer Sglue (Elmer's Glue, get it?) is picked on in ""Paste Makes Waste"", mostly by Mitch, but the icing on the cake comes when Buttercup, encouraged by Mitch and the others, except for Blossom and Bubbles, cries out, ""Eat this, paste-eater!"" and hurls a clod of paste at him.  An accident makes Elmer a giant behemoth hell-bent on getting even with those who picked on him.  Basically a well-taught lesson on why it's bad to pick on others.  (Rating:  4)
""School House Rocked"" has the Gangreen Gang being caught by truant officer Jack Wednesday (guess how this guy talks?) and being sent to (what was Wednesday thinking?) Pokey Oaks Kindergarden, where they cause all sorts of trouble.  (Rating:  4).
Despite the label on the video, the bonus cartoon features Cowardly Dog's fight against some hostile eggplant, not the Sheep In The City cartoon.  (Rating:  3).
Overall rating:  (4+5+5+4+4+3)/6=4.2, rounded down to 4.",1041638400,7,2497,4.942168674698795
182617,4,1560396539,"Another collection featuring those pint-sized heroines.
""Dream Scheme"" has the Sandman, burned out after having to clamp down on delinquent sleepers, decides to put the world to sleep so he can get more than a couple of winks.  The narration and character dialogue is done entirely in rhyming iambic pentameter.  Examples from the Sandman:  ""Oh, those brats are ruining my ploy/By staying awake, they're stealing my joy/I'll pay them a visit, a little house call/And take care of this matter once and for all.""  (Rating:  5)
""Just Another Manic Mojo"" shows how insular and disconnected Mojo is from the rest of Townsville.  However, I can understand, given how he perceives the ""gum-chewing, finger-snapping, and inane gossip while waiting for the light to change.  ""Accursed people"", indeed!  He tries to get rid of the Puffs after their baseball lands in his volcano observatory, but he doesn't reckon on their mischief.  Highlights:  Bubbles and the gum-popping, and Mojo's photo album.  And the scene where Mojo's turban is placed on his head is clearly taken from a similar scene involving Darth Vader in Empire Strikes Back.  (Rating:  5)
In ""Down And Dirty,"" Buttercup's refusal to take a bath after fighting some substance-spewing monsters leads her to become a septic sister and alienating her from her sisters and the Townies.  Highlights:  the mucus-blasting mutant elephant and Buttercup's expression when she licks one of the elephant's discharges off her face.  Also, the mayor receiving a complaint:  ""Do you think I'm blind?  Of course I smell it.""  And the best lines:  Buttercup:  ""Don't you know only big fat sissies take baths?""  Bubbles:  ""I'm not fat.""  My favorite episode in this collection.  (Rating:  5)
In ""The Mo Job,"" Princess and Mojo team up in a scheme to get rid of the Powerpuffs, by giving Princess Powerpuff powers.  Their high volume exchange of their agreement, taking place in view of the full public, is a laugh.  The slowed down dialogue in the climactic battle is another highlight.  (Rating:  5)
Major Man, a typical bemuscled, mousse-haired superhero spouting corny dialogue, steals the Powerpuff Girls' role as Townsville's superhero after he saves the people in ""Major Competition.""  Do the Powerpuff Girls regain their spotlight?  Oh, like you don't know?  (Rating:  3.5)
The bonus cartoon, three-part Sheep In The City, is more a C-feature than a B-feature.  Do yourself a favor and rewind the video after watching ""Major Competition.""  (Rating:  1)
Overall rating:  (5+5+5+5+3.5+1)/6 = 4.08, rounded to 4.",1033689600,10,2554,5.169117647058823

182619,4,1560396539,"The Powerpuff girls has a generation-crossing charm. The sharp comic-book style is well translated on DVD: it looks crisp and it's a lot of fun to watch a few of the shorter episodes in a row, minus commercials. But as extras go, Down 'N' Dirty isn't very fancy. Although it has some of the most classic episodes, you're really better off with ""Mane Event"" if you want any bells or whistles.
If you're just in it for some straight-forward fun, look no further.",997920000,3,460,4.554216867469879

However, she noticed that on the box cover, it states that there are 3 games in this dvd. I cannot find them and there is no website or phone number to ask the common "" how do I?"" questions.

182623,5,1560396539,"For a couple of years, ""The Powerpuff Girls' have been running on the Cartoon Network. However, if television comercials bring you down, have no fear! Finally, all us PPG fans have a reason to rejoice - with the release of episode collections on DVD!  The many parodies, action-packed adventures, and insight on three very different super-powered sisters, these cartoons will delight any cartoon fan.  With all the vulgarity and hard core violence in today's television shows, ""The Powerpuff Girls"" are a breath of fresh air. Bright colors, well-paced stories, identifiable bad-guys, and plenty of laughs, this show has separated itself from the rest. Not as dark as ""Scooby-Doo"", or gross as ""Ren and Stimpy"", or even close to the harshness of ""South Park"", this is a cartoon for all ages. ""For once again, the day is saved...thanks to..THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!""",975542400,,859,5.128571428571429

7796107,5,1560396539,"Now, you may know the story. Sugar, spice, everything nice. These were the ingredients Professor Utonium used to create the perfect girl. Then, all of a sudden, he ""accidentally"" added another ingredient to his concoction - CHEMICAL X! Thus, the Powerpuff Girls were born. Thus, with their ultra super powers, Blossom, the leader, Bubbles, the joy and the laughter, and Buttercup, the toughest fighter, have dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forces of evil in the city of Townsville and all before bedtime.

In this compilation, which I enjoyed, you can expect the perfect blend of comedy, crime-fighting, fun, and adventure that viewers such as myself have come to enjoy. In ""Birthday Bash"", it's the Powerpuff Girls' birthday and three baddies from the Powerpuff Girls' rogue gallery (Well, normally, one would NOT expect the Amoeba Boys to be counted as part of it but they're in jail here so, for this episode, they count.) have given the girls gifts designed to destroy them and their party, much to the rest of the prison population's anticipation. However, they won't get a chance to succeed if the girls have anything to say about it.

Then, the rest of the episodes deal with eating vegetables in a fun way, especially since the Broccoloids have invaded and hypnotized the vegetable eating parents, the consequences of bullying (A big nice job breaking it, good guys should go to Mitch and the other kids bullying Elmer and for escalating the conflict where Buttercup gets into the act, setting up the dilemma for the episode once toxic waste and glue in Elmer's mouth meet.), what will happen if the Gangrene Gang ever get sent to Pokey Oaks Kindergarten (Ms. Keane should have given Jack Wednesday a real Reason You Suck speech, doing a thorough Take That at his condescending and interruptive social skills even though his karmic punishment is pretty good too.), and why it's never a good idea to give Bubbles amnesia (Mojo is to blame for this, contrary to what Blossom would believe. And who knew Buttercup would be a good Voice of Reason, even if it was for only 15-30 seconds?).

Finally, the whole compilation ends with the Courage The Cowardly Dog episode ""Journey To The Center Of Nowhere"", where eggplant creatures attack the farm and Courage has to save the day.

Highly recommended.",1411257600,,2318,4.905612244897959
