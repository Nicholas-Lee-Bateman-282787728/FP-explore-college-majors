7868268,5,6304343442,"I just stumbled across this jewel while browsing Amazon. I am glad I did and super happy I went ahead and bought it! I have watched it several times and have enjoyed the performance Mr. Pullman has given every time. This is an excellent movie and one I have no problem recommending...especially if you are a Pullman fan. It is tense to the very end and you will find yourself completely forgetting you can use the pause for ""breaks"" of any kind. This movie shows the range and quality performance he can give!",1341532800,2,509,4.483870967741935
7868269,3,6304343442,HBO needs to stick to showing other people's movies and give up on making their own. Bill Pullman (While You Were Sleeping) gives it his best shot in this unrealistic movie of a cop holding prisoners at gun point in a courtroom and letting the whole world see it on television. It's a sad sign of the times.  Another great actor that didn't get used well was Robert Loggia (Big). Great talent needs to work to become better. This movie justs makes you wish they didn't have to do movies like this to perfect their craft.,1005782400,4,520,4.416666666666667
