8432959,5,B004KIA1GG,"This is the best workout on earth. It is amazing for the spine in my opinion. It is amazing for alignment and creating long lean muscles. It is relaxing, Tanya is so encouraging and kind, but it is still a moderately challenging toning workout.  I have TMJD issues so I can't do super aggressive workouts, like Jillian Michaels for example. What good is a workout that leaves you in the bad kind of pain? This is the best workout on earth for long lean arms, trust me. I like the lower body workout. The abs is not super challenging, but again great for overall body balancing. I've never experienced a better video for my needs. It needs to be re-released. I've tried a lot of videos and this one is one of my all time favorites.",1404345600,,730,4.367647058823529
