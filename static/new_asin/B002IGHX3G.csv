3936487,5,B002IGHX3G,"I've never been to any other state in America that is more obsessed about itself than perhaps Idaho and for good reason. At times America is know to give certain states more credit than they deserve (take a look at Texas) and others don't receive viable recognition. Idaho is one of those states. It is often confused with Iowa and Ohio when in fact it is larger than both and filled with crisp clear lakes, rugged mountains and the deepest river gorge in North America. It is far more than potatoes. I think at times the narration is a bit overdone but is extremely well complemented by the aerials. It is overall an excellent DVD! I recommend almost all of the series as I have most of them. Buy this even if you aren't from the state because you might find yourself learning about a part of America you knew little to nothing about.",1274054400,8,835,4.428571428571429
3936488,5,B002IGHX3G,Good video -- I never knew that Idaho had so many different looking regions.  I am looking forward to flying over much of it in my light plane.,1256947200,,143,4.107142857142857
3936489,4,B002IGHX3G,"This documentary originally aired in 1999 on Idaho Public TV's ""Outdoors Idaho"" series, and was previously only available on DVD-R from the station.  This is a much improved pressing, and is cheaper to boot.  The aerial photography was shot in native 16:9, presumably with a high-def camera.  The narration is cheezy (think ""chamber of commerce"") but on the whole this is probably the best one-hour documentary on scenic Idaho.  Although Amazon doesn't mention it, this package from Topics Entertainment includes a second DVD disc of PBS's ""Over America"" thrown in, making this an even better deal.  Both discs are anamorphically enhanced for widescreen 16:9 televisions.",1255737600,9,671,5.352380952380952
3936490,5,B002IGHX3G,"This well-filmed, well-narrated video covers Idaho East to West and South to North. It follows the landscape by following the rivers of Idaho- the backbone of the state.
This is a video worth owning, with it's lovely background music it makes you long to be in the outdoors, wandering through the peaks and valleys. Though some may say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, anyone who watches this will say that the varied landscapes of Idaho are indeed beautiful.",1034553600,4,464,4.7407407407407405

3936505,5,B002IGHX3G,"I was planning on moving somewhere out west (currently live in Florida) and have purchased several dvd's to learn about the states I was interested in potentially relocating too.  After watching dvd's about Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and Idaho, I was taken back at how much life Idaho offered and how much it truly matched what I am looking for.  I didn't know anything about Idaho until I watched this dvd.  Come on, how many people really know about Idaho?  Since watching the dvd, I've done tons of research on Idaho and I am hooked.  It is a hidden gem! If you're planning on relocating or just wanting a different place to vacation, check out Idaho, you won't be disappointed.",1374192000,6,690,4.716666666666667

3936507,5,B002IGHX3G,"This portrays very nice how Idaho is so diverse. I shows the natural beauty of  the state. It does not address economical, demographics or cultural aspects. Just geography and topography of the state. I was fascinated by it.",1364774400,,224,4.894736842105263

3936510,5,B002IGHX3G,"Idaho an Aerial Tapestry (PBS)is a Magic Carpet Ride of splendid beauty.  Having driven through Idaho, and thinking it was one of the most beautiful places on Earth, I realized while viewing Idaho an Aerial Tapestry the amazing diversity of Idaho's topographic tapestry I had missed while driving.
