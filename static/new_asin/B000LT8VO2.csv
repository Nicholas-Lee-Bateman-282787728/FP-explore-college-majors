2713917,5,B000LT8VO2,"""Fastwalkers"" is the kind of UFO documentary that ought to put to rest the notions that UFOs can be explained by mundane causes, and, more significantly, that we are the sole inhabitants of planet Earth.  Expert testimony from retired military personel, air-line pilots and private investigators lead to the same conclusion: we are not alone.

Yet the mass media refuses to treat this subject with the seriousness it deserves and perpetuates the illusion that the UFO is irrelevant.  The evidence, however, is overwhelming. Across the globe, from Brazil to Belgium, the UFO is an acknowledged phenomenon.  Yet the major media in the US enforce a virtual black-out to preserve the fiction that the UFO doesn't exist. Jaime Maussan has been airing UFO footage on Mexico's ""60 Minutes"" for years, yet we in America remain in the dark.

This documentary pulls away the veil of secrecy to reveal the truth about the ET and their long-time presence on what we like to think of as our planet, Earth.",1172016000,10,992,4.916167664670659
2713918,5,B000LT8VO2,"I had my first flying saucer sighting back in the late 1950's and have been interested in this phenomena since then. I am an investigator for the Mutual UFO Network, have a bookcase full of books and videos on UFOs, and consider myself an expert on the subject. The 'Fastwalkers' DVD is one of the best UFO documentaries ever done and includes interviews with many of the top people studying the UFO phenomena. I would highly reccommend this video for anyone who wants to learn more about the UFO subject.",1169251200,9,505,4.622222222222222
2713919,5,B000LT8VO2,"This is one of the most amazing DVDs that I have ever seen. It manages to cover the history of UFOs, and at the same time, explore the implications of ETs visiting our planet. Anyone who has even the slightest interest in the UFO phenomenon will find this DVD fascinating. The individuals speaking on the DVD are retired military personnel, scientists, historians, pilots, government officials, and credible UFO investigators. It is a must buy.",1167782400,13,444,5.013513513513513
2713920,2,B000LT8VO2,"I'm sorry to say but I'm not impressed by this dvd.

I don't like to diss this sort of thing because I want the people involved to have their say but it's sadly just not worth buying.

Why would we be interested in so called ""disclosure"" from individuals who are not in the position to ""disclose""?

What matters isn't speculation and opinion from individuals of various fields. What's important for a movie of this sort is disclosure of facts from insiders political and military. Which it's clear they had the resources to do this but didn't. The people who made this seemed to have an agenda to push a positive spin on the aliens; I'm surprised they didn't let Greer talk half the show. I don't see a problem with looking only at the ""positive"" aspects of beings that are clearly more powerful than us; it's not like we can do anything to defend if any have negative agendas. But this movie seems (IMO) to have deliberately singled out clips from those interviewed to fit personal agendas of the makers. It is inevitable of course but not to the degree which this was done. The movie does a disservice to their full opinions and it should have been much longer; it's obvious they recorded much more to these interviews.",1167523200,6,1221,4.566210045662101

8164112,4,B000LT8VO2,this is one of my favorite documentaries on the subject. Its mostly interviews but has great footage as well. Worth getting. The only down side is the cross eyed alien abductee. Couldnt the aliens help him to see straight?LOL! worth getting!,1303430400,,241,4.902439024390244
8164113,1,B000LT8VO2,"My background is that I'm a person who would more than anything like proof of UFO's, but has yet to see any convincing proof.  This video is yet another item that claims to finally uncover everything but simply rehashes tired ""information"".

The video has a large number of people offering somewhat conflicting stories about the UFO coverup.  Their descriptions of the aliens differ, their description of the intentions of aliens differ.  Near the end they lean towards how the government is suppressing aliens from taking us to the next step of development.

The footage of the ""Fastwalkers"", when revealed, are blurry bits zipping around in Apollo footage of the moon taken from space and which could as easily be dirt or something stuck to the camera as it could be a spaceship viewed from VERY far away.  There's lots of old, tired  pictures of ""UFO's"" and footage of lights from afar.  As for the new pictures, in the age of digital cameras UFO's obviously now know to stay far enough away that they take up a few pixels of the image.

The stories people tell about meeting aliens are almost entirely from over forty years ago, from people who you can tell have told these stories again and again.  You get the suspicion that a lot of meal tickets have depended on these stories, whether they are true or false.

Where is the new evidence?  Where is the clinching proof?  Where's the other side of the story?  The fact is, there isn't any presented.  They seem to lean towards the aliens being a subjective experience, in which case there will never be any evidence.  Some of these people seem to consider aliens more of a religious experience than something that can be tangibly proven, and if that's the case then what's the point?

What did I like?  Well, it was watchable.  The computer graphics were cheesy to the point of being amusing.  There was one line I thought was very well put though - one interviewer says ""Are the aliens good or bad?  Well, you can't look up at a 747 in the sky and say 'are those good people or bad people on that plane?'"".

That was one well put line in a rather unimpressive video.",1225065600,4,2122,4.572944297082228

8164115,1,B000LT8VO2,"There is absolutely nothing compelling, or thought provoking about this movie, If you are familiar with the folks in this DVD then you will simply hear them give a rehash of info you already know!!!!
  A good UFO DVD convinces the sceptic!! and you cannot do that by not explaining which scenes are just some CGI filler crap to make the movie go along or are these scenes actual verifiable UFO footage.
  Most of the material(DVDs,Videos) from Germany and Eastern Europe, does more harm to the serious study of ET phenomenon then supporting it!!!!!",1187913600,5,548,4.797872340425532
8164116,5,B000LT8VO2,"Fastwalkers: They Are Here is a powerful cinematic presentation of a cutting-edge new paradigm which is destined to completely change our concept of humans and their relation to the Universe. Director Miles has masterfully assembled a collage of credible witnesses from military, scientific, and journalistic sectors within an international context which is tastefully low-key, yet deeply credible and intellectually compelling. This landmark documentary skillfully introduces the emerging paradigm of ""Exopolitics"" into the Global Arena as a bright new pathway for renaissance, enlightenment and survival of Humans as an evolutionary species.

Out of the Blue is by far the best UFO documentary to come along in recent years. Although I've yet to see a completely objective UFO film.",1180656000,6,192,4.485714285714286
8164118,1,B000LT8VO2,"There is no stunning new footage. Why did they sell something saying there is when clearly there isn't! All it is is 90 mins of experts talking.. and talking.. and talking.. it almost put me sleep! No substance, or exciting new information. It's just them giving their opinions on the same boring crap we've heard for decades. And don't get me started on the poorly designed graphics and robotic host. I could've made this DVD myself, really! Just take a bunch of experts, sit them down and have them talk for 90 mins, and make sure to plug their books. There is nothing new in what they're saying.. it's all been said and done before under a new ""clever"" name.. Fastwalkers! Absolutely boring. Nothing new. Move on.",1177113600,9,716,4.645669291338582
