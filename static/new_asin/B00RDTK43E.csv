6928855,5,B00RDTK43E,"I just got back from Best Buy and blew threw this documentary.... WOW... they really did a great job!

instead of stuffing this with regurgitated lists of matches and promos and bonus content that is easily available on line let me try and describe just how great the documentary element of this is without spoiling it.  Heartbreaking... for sure, honest... seems to be, and the participants range from Sting to the Hulkster...... with surprisingly teary eyed Vince and Linda hitting just the right notes.  They have a bunch of great extra footage of Warrior not used in the previous project (some of the best filmed around his entry into the HOF) and so we don't have a documentary with everybody talking about the subject, Warrior is the main voice on the doc.  The bonus matches and promos are a perfect addition to the content of the previous set but the gold here is the hour and a half documentary that shows the full circle Warrior made in his life and the joy at his return and .... goodness, I can understand why his heart blew up ... the emotions he experienced over that several day period was letting the top off of 18 years of pain and also filling a huge hole in him..... that even his family could not heal.  This isn't a Kayfabe production at all..... it is the story of a real man who started off without a real idea of where he was going, hit gold, refused to bend  and ultimately (excuse the pun) lived to see his redemption.  Jim was far too young when he passed for me to wax about how lucky he was and his family was to get all the loose ends tied up.. I think they'd all be happier if none of it happened and he was still alive..... I hope my purchase somehow sends a few royalty cents off to his family.  If you are wondering ... it is very much worth the investment and the hour and a half of bonus footage in the blu ray has some surprisingly tender and funny moments left off the documentary along with more matches including a very special one.  HIGHEST recommendation to the WWE nation.

PS... my only gripe with the first set from last year was the lack of Warriors iconic promos... they have emptied the vaults in that regard on this set.  The perfect collection would be more of a mix , but goodness that's quibbling....",1428969600,11,2252,4.389423076923077

Holy crap! No joking this is the ultimate set WWE has ever put out over one superstar. Stone Cold's last Blu-ray was epic but this far surpasses it. I don't know if WWE if making it up to Warrior for making fun of him by releasing one of the most comprehensive set ever over one superstar. While they did have a set last year they listened to me & put some of the big man matches one this set including Haku, Earthquake, & Papa Shango just to name a few. The long asked for match of LOD & Warrior VS Demolition is finally here. The only missing piece of Hogan-Warrior 2. I don't know if it'll ever see the light of day but even without it, hands down one of the greatest, probably top 5, WWE set has ever put out over a wrestler.

*Thanks to Wrestling DVD News for the updated listing*

Overall: This looks to be a continuation of Ultimate Warrior's last DVD that was released last Spring and based off the listing, it looks to be just as good if not better than the Ultimate Collection. I look forward to seeing the documentary portion of the DVD that includes words from Warrior himself, his family, the McMahon family, and various WWE superstars and legends. This DVD covers moments and matches from Warrior's career and just about every promotion he was a part of. WCCW, WWE, and WCW. Just like the last, this looks to be a must have for any Warrior fans",1421625600,32,5898,5.039419087136929

6928861,5,B00RDTK43E,"I'm not a wrestling fan. That needs to be stated right off the bat. However, I'm a child of the 80's and 90's and I definitely have a special place in my heart for the popular wrestlers of the time. The fact remains, I'm not a diehard or even casual fan at this point in my life.

So, why did I buy this movie, watch it and absolutely love it? Because there is something about The Ultimate Warrior that transcends sports entertainment and professional wrestling. There is something about The Ultimate Warrior and the man behind the makeup that resonates with people the world over, many of whom are not necessarily ""wrestling fans"".

I rediscovered The Warrior recently as I was preparing some artwork for an 80s wrestling themed art exhibit. I wanted to draw the Ultimate Warrior. I'm a cartoonist/comic book artist and the character of the Ultimate Warrior spoke to my sensibilities big time. As is mentioned in the documentary, he looked like an action figure or a comic book superhero. I had to draw him! Anyway, I started researching him to get a feel for the character before starting my artwork. I watched his matches and researched his life and legacy. I came away feeling genuinely inspired and excited about The Ultimate Warrior and what he stood for. This new excitement and interest led me to buy this film. I'm thankful I did.

This movie paints a loving, respectful portrait of an electrifying entertainer and good man who cared about motivating others to find the value in themselves and their lives. The film is full of interesting insight regarding Warrior's career and most strikingly, a great deal of very emotional testimonies from those closest to the man. I was deeply moved by this film and I'm proud to say I'm officially an Ultimate Warrior fan.

Great picture quality and tons of supplementary material. I highly recommend this to wrestling fans and non-wrestling fans alike. There is tremendous motivational value in the character of The Ultimate Warrior and the multi-faceted legacy he has left behind. The Warrior reminds us that It does matter, we must do the work of our lives and we must Always Believe!!",1459814400,3,2136,4.796195652173913

6928867,5,B00RDTK43E,"This is an incredible Documentary, by far one of the best that WWE has ever produced. The details and information about Warrior's life and how he came up through the ranks of the business, to hsi falling out with the Mcmahons, and then documanting his return to grace as it were. Its amazing to see how Wrestling is a business, but the way the Mcmahon's run it, it is family. Warrior is sort of the black sheep of the family, but also one of the most loved. What was also amazing is how HHH truly has an innate talent to mend old wounds and bring people together. I commend him for making this reunion possible, because without him, Warrior would have died without realizing closure in his life. Triple H, if you are out there reading this...Thank you for your contributions to bringing Warrior home where he belongs.

Warriors passion for the business for the shoert time that he was in it was incredible. But his passion for his family was even more incredible. He lived live without making compromises, he lived with integrity and honor, and he raised a beautiful family whom can be proud to call him father. I wish them well.",1442275200,2,1129,4.534313725490196

6928879,5,B00RDTK43E,"Let me just start by saying, I don't follow the WWE or watch any wrestling for that matter.  However, when I was a kid, I used to watch the WWF all the time.  Back in the day, the WWF was full of crazy, cartoonish like characters and no one was better or more entertaining to me than the Ultimate Warrior.  Hulk Hogan hooked me on the WWF first, but the first time I saw the Ultimate Warrior as a kid, he quickly became my favorite and the reason I kept watching.  After he left the WWF I kind of lost interest and grew out of my fascination with the WWF.

With all of that said, when I saw this documentary, I had to check it out.  It is a great tribute to one of the most entertaining wrestlers that the WWE/WWF ever had.  It was great to see how he got his start and his rise to being one of the most well known and beloved wrestlers/entertainers of all time.  I also love how much they involved his wife and two daughters in the documentary. These characters were larger than life, but to see a personal side to him was interesting.

I have to say at the end of the documentary, it kind of drags on a little bit too long and a lot of the content (after he passed away) is more about the wife and kids and how they are coping with their loss.  I'm not saying it shouldn't be part of the documentary, but from an editing perspective, should have been added as extra features.  This is just me nit picking a bit on how I would have done it.

The extra content is great.  You get to see a large collection of his WWF interviews where he's yelling at the camera, spouting out threats and nonsense in the Ultimate Warrior kinda way...Some of them are hilarious in a good way and they brought me back to my childhood.  I always thought he sounded like a barbarian from the dark ages or something...great stuff.

There are also some full matches that are included as well.

I highly recommend this documentary to anyone who was a fan of The Ultimate Warrior...even if you're not into watching this stuff anymore (like me).  I also recommend it to anyone who is into wrestling now, but maybe the warrior was before your time.  This is a great history lesson on one of the great entertainers in wrestling history.",1437264000,,2207,4.251798561151079
6928880,3,B00RDTK43E,"The Ultimate Warrior (originally Jim Hellwig), a wrestler who achieved greatness and then walked away from the industry. For years he was a pariah with the WWE with the company sinking to incredible lows by releasing The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior, a one disc DVD of WWE Superstars burying the companys former top star.  The Warrior retaliated with a lawsuit and things never seemed any more heated. And then suddenly in 2014, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as its headline inductee. He appeared on Monday Night Raw two days later, making an unforgettable speech to his fans. The following day he collapsed from a heart attack and was gone.
Fans looking back at the Ultimate Warriors career may have difficulty appreciating his impact on the sport. The biggest reason for this is the Warriors short run in the business. While his run was relatively short, he was incredibly over. His size and physique, his short squash matches and his off-the-wall interviews quickly won him over to wrestling fans. Vince McMahon took note of the Warriors popularity and groomed him to take Hulk Hogans place as World Wrestling Federation (WWF) champion with the idea of making Hulk Hogan continuing on as a special attraction, much as Bruno Sammartino had done after Bob Backlund became WWWF champion. Unfortunately the Ultimate Warrior and McMahon butted heads over pay. When the Warrior refused to wrestle at the 1991 SummerSlam PPV unless he received a pay raise, McMahon reluctantly gave in only to suspend the Warrior after the show (In McMahons eyes, the Warrior had held him up). While Vince McMahon continued to acknowledge the Ultimate Warriors appeal to the fans, their business relationship was troubled at best. Two brief returns to the WWF in 1992 and 1996 were welcomed by the fans but again, the Warriors behind the scenes squabbles with McMahon led to premature departures both times.
Last year, the WWE released Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection, a Blu-Ray collection of some of the Warriors biggest matches along with occasional comments from Hellwig. This year its released even more matches and promos along with a documentary on Jim Hellwig. The video begins with a recap of the Warriors career, going back to his early days where he teamed with Sting to his time in the territories prior to his entry into the WWF. While the Ultimate Warrior is usually mentioned as one of the top stars of the late 1980s and early 90s, his career was incredibly short compared to other stars such as Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair. Thus its no surprise that the video feature doesnt have a lot of time to cover. However the feature is fairly lengthly because it spends considerable time focusing on the Ultimate Warriors last days and the incredible reconciliation between him and Vince McMahon.
Some may feel this is the WWEs way of apologizing to him for the truly rotten way they treated him. Some may even claim that the WWE is cashing in on his death by releasing this video. Looking at the timing of the videos release and the way that the documentary goes out of its way to show that the higher-ups at the WWE (including Vince McMahon, daughter Stephanie, and Stephanies husband Triple) reached out to Hellwig, the documentary does seem a bit exploitive to me. When the documentary goes on to show us how the Warriors family was helped in its grief by the WWE, you cant help but see the documentary as more of a celebration of how great the WWE treats its past and current employees rather than a celebration of a wrestlers career and legacy.
For those unfamiliar with the Ultimate Warriors relationship with the WWF, let me bring you up to speed. In 2005, the WWE released a one disc DVD entitled The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior. The DVD featured a documentary on the Ultimate Warrior, basically burying him as a no-talent bum who was in the right place at the right time but who proved to be a flash in the pan. The DVD featured WWE Superstars mocking the Warriors interview style and recalling how no one really liked him (According to stories I have heard, the WWE was prepared to make a similar hatchet job DVD covering the career of Bret The Hitman Hart but changed it to a glowing piece upon Brets reconciliation with the WWE). As one might expect, the Warrior did not take kindly to the DVD.
Many WWE Superstars have burnt bridges with Vince McMahon only to patch things up however in the case of the Ultimate Warrior it seemed highly unlikely (as Gorilla Monsoon might have said). That changed in 2013 when the Warrior spoke positively about McMahon on an episode of his YouTube channel. Behind the scenes, the WWE began to reach out to the Ultimate Warrior with Triple H taking the lead. The documentary shows the long road that led to reconciliation and the Warriors agreement to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. For me, the fact that cameras were around so much throughout the various steps of the reconciliation made the documentary seem a bit plastic. Obviously no one had any idea that the Ultimate Warrior would die so unexpectedly but at times, the proceedings seem like something out of a bad reality show.
Another part of the feature deals with the Warriors family dealing with his death. We see many WWE Superstars helping the family with wrestler Nattie Neidhart taking a very personal interest in helping the Warriors family deal with their grief and start the healing process. Its nice to see this side of the WWE but again, I cant think of other stories such as how CM Punk claims he received his release papers from the WWE on his wedding day. Its great that the WWE has helped the Warriors family through a difficult time but the WWE should know better than to pat itself on the back in a video release.
With the documentary focusing more on the WWEs goodwill towards the Warrior and his family, the real question becomes whether or not the rest of the product is good enough to justify purchasing it. The rest of the video features more matches from the Ultimate Warriors career (thankfully, none of them are duplicates from his previous video) along with a ton of Warrior promos. The only drawback with the matches is that they feature way too many squash matches. The Warrior was known for quickly dispatching of his opponents (much as the Road Warriors did in their heyday) and its good to see a couple examples of what got the Warrior over. However the video really didn't need so many squashes. The video would have been better served by showing more matches from the Warriors pre-WWF days along with some house show matches from his time in the WWF.
Die-hard Warrior fans should enjoy the matches and promos included on the video. Casual fans may not be so thrilled by the matches and promos. The Ultimate Warriors promos are not for everyone. Some people enjoy his maniacal esoteric style while others think hes simply spouting gibberish. If you're a casual fan and haven't purchased the Warriors previous video, Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection, go with that one rather than Ultimate Warrior: Always Believe.",1436140800,6,7096,4.769105691056911

6928910,5,B00RDTK43E,"If last years 'Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection' was Warrior's point of view on his career and the WWE setting history straight ahead of his induction to the HOF, then 'Ultimate Warrior: Always Believe' is Dana Warrior and the WWE's posthumous tribute to Warrior the man outside the ring and a celebration of his career as a pivotal wrestler in the history of sports entertainment. Overall this is a superlative set with a few minor/significant complaints. The content comprises of four sections- documentary, matches, promos & extras. Let's take a look at them...

The documentary 'Always Believe' is a beefed up version of the doc 'Warrior: The Ultimate Legend' which aired during Warrior Week last year on the WWE network and now features at least 30 minutes of extra footage of Warrior during WMXXX weekend and stuff from this year with his family as they talk about life since his passing. How I feel about this is that it's a great documentary but it feels a little bloated and like a bit of a Frankenstein job since it's one doc narrated by Warrior from last year for the most part, then toward the end it's mostly new footage of the Warrior girls talking about life after Warrior and following them around WWE HQ this year. I loved seeing all that stuff with them, but I would have preferred to have seen this footage along with the Warrior girls related extras edited into a separate doc and have 'Warrior: The Ultimate Legend' presented in its original form. Anyway, that aside its still a great watch and you can see that filming these new segments was cathartic for Warrior's family which was important.

Matches- there's some great stuff on here, my favourites being an Andre match from 1989 I'd never seen before (I loved that feud, so Iconic), his first WWF title defence against Haku (regarded by many as the toughest guy who ever wrestled) and his 1996 Raw matches against Isaac Yankem (Kane) and Owen Hart (final WWE match). Why his 1996 KOTR match against Goldust is absent is anyone's guess. But on the downside there are no PPV matches. I was really hoping this set would include some more of his illustrious main event PPVs, but but I'm a afraid not. I really wanted to see his WMV match against Rude when he drops the IC belt, SS90 cage match against Rude, SS92 against Macho in old Wembley in front of 88 thousand- what a setting! And the crap yet iconic WCW Hogan rematch from 1998. I can only assume the reason they are not on here is because they are gonna milk this and give us another blu ray at some point.

Promos- excellent collection ranging from Dingo Warrior to the WCW. I would have liked a few more from 1990, my favourite Warrior year, but you can't complain here. Extras- again excellent. The full HOF speech is a treat (although annoyingly WWE have bleeped Warrior's swear words out), some cool matches are included, Dana and the girls tell entertaining stories about the man and there are a few deleted scenes from WMXXX weekend where Warrior talks about the stories behind stuff like the iconic 'Crash The Plane' promo. Very cool. To conclude this set is definitely worth buying if you're a fan. The documentary segments more than validate purchase and there is a ton of rare matches and awesome vintage promos. If they had included the aforementioned PPV main events this would have been a truly outstanding collection, but if their absence means we end up getting more Warrior matches released in the long run I guess that's a good thing.",1432166400,,3491,4.691680261011419

But this is a wonderful, personal journey about the final few days of Warriors life. WWE really did a great job and not only was Warrior a great wrestler and character, he was a wonderful husband and father.",1429401600,,479,3.9791666666666665
6928934,4,B00RDTK43E,"Amazing how things can go from a triumph to a tragedy in less than a week as after 18 years of bad feelings on both sides that they finally made peace with each other to give him the opportunity to not only have his career reflected on in a positive life but also celebrated throughout the biggest weekend of the year only for it to end with his unfortunate passing leading to this presentation looking back at not only his career & the road to making peace within the industry but his life outside of wrestling with his family in ""Ultimate Warrior: Always Believe.""  Now this presentation is very similar to the previous release from The Shield & the upcoming Daniel Bryan documentaries were this was originally aired on their network only to be released onto home video with deleted scenes however this presentation also included close to 30 minutes of additional footage that was shot after the original airing featuring comments from Warrior himself along with his family (wife Dana & daughters Indiana & Mattigan), Triple H, John Cena, Cesaro, The McMahons (Vince, Linda, Stephanie), Sting, Jerry Lawler, Zeb Colter, Jim Ross, WCCW wrestler Bill Irwin, Hulk Hogan, Kofi Kingston, Batista, Dolph Ziggler, Dean Ambrose, Sheamus, and Sgt. Slaughter.  The theme of this presentation was following Warrior through the steps of his return to WWE from returning to ""Titan Towers"" for the first time to being backstage for WrestleMania weekend in New Orleans (Hall Of Fame, WrestleMania 30, RAW) having his thoughts on the whole experience along with his wife & daughter's experience returning to New Orleans after their loss in between the documentary itself.

Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now in that the positives for this set are what I stated earlier in how WWE heavily expanded this past what we already saw on the WWE Network presentation covering not just Warrior but his family as well plus I know some people would criticize how they didn't spend more time on his in-ring career & accomplishments but we've already heard those stories on the previous DVD sets so this was more personal covering his comeback & family life which I enjoyed very much.  The only negatives I can say is that there were still some Warrior matches that were better quality still unreleased onto DVD or missing from his previous sets only for us to still get some of these unimportant & uninteresting fillers but at least we still got some cool rare gems including rare tag matches.  Overall I have to say that I enjoyed the set that I would recommend.

The documentary begins with strong words from his wife Dana going into Warrior's story of what he was originally studying in college & his career in bodybuilding followed by how he met Sting & their beginnings as a team along with the influence of the man we now know as Zeb Colter lead to their run as the Blade Runners before going into why he went on as a solo act into World Class Championship Wrestling with the funny story behind where the name ""Dingo Warrior"" came from.  His career in WWE was talked about next from the different unique elements of his character to memorable moments of his career such as SummerSlam '89 to how things came together for the ""Ultimate Challenge"" of WrestleMania VI to the Retirement Match at WrestleMania VII as far as why Savage was his best opponent & the importance of how he ""pinned"" Savage at the end of that match before going into how things started to go bad from there with what happened at the end of SummerSlam '91 and why the plans for him after return at WrestleMania VIII didn't happen followed by the importance of his life as a family man was discussed next as far as how he met Dana & the funny line he used when he first met her & the important relationship with his daughters including the things he would do every birthday to show his love before going into what went wrong during his short time in WCW.  One of the biggest discussions on his presentation was reflecting on ""The Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior"" DVD from Warrior's feelings on it along with Dana describing just how much it effected him to the lawsuit & Warrior's reaction to seeing Vince at the trial before briefly discussing the loyalty & getting his message to his fans throughout the years.  Another big part of the documentary came here discussing Warrior eventual return to WWE from who was the middle man between the negotiations & how instrumental Triple H was during the process leading up to the Hall Of Fame & the importance of not only why he chose his ""Mom"" as his inductor but the special gift he gave Vince & importance of his speech before showing his backstage meeting at WrestleMania with Hulk Hogan along with his appearance of RAW & what relevance of a specific picture taken.  The documentary concluded with Dana telling the story of his death & the support shown to the family including one specific diva's importance to Warrior's daughters along with returning to the arena in New Orleans before concluding with Dana & her daughters having their final words to Warrior.

Matches Include:
Dingo Warrior vs. Perry Jackson & Chico Cabello - It should be noted that not only was Gary Hart managing Warrior during this time but the match was held under elimination rules meaning that Warrior had to defeat both men as he utilized the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as he was able to take one man out of competition in order to focus beating on the other on more than one occasion utilizing his power in a quick dominate showcase.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" July '86

Dingo Warrior vs. Big Bear Collie - This was another quick match with Warrior using his power offense along with some mat wrestling such as a grounded armbar & athletic ability such as a dropkick & running crossbody with this being significant for him actually delivering this offense against a man of similar size with Big Bear weighing close to 300 lbs.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" June '87

vs. Frenchy Martin - This was Warrior's Madison Square Garden debut as Martin's offense had to effect with Warrior just easily overpowering Martin shoving him to the outside & powering him down throughout the match.
""Madison Square Garden"" Nov. '87

vs. Brian Costello - This was your basic quick Warrior squash in that I think it's only relevant for it being his national television debut.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Nov. '87

vs. Mike Sharpe - ""Canada's greatest athlete"" kept stalling & avoiding him as Warrior was able to use his power causing Sharpe to resort to desperate tactics such as raking the eyes & choking Warrior using the ropes while keeping a slow pace & even used Warrior's own momentum against him at one point as Warrior continued to rely on his fast paced high impact power offense with Sharpe giving Warrior the most resistance he's had to to his early point in his career.
Dec. '87

vs. Conquistador #1 - This was your trademark Warrior squash match where he easily dominated with his power including punching him so hard that it knocked him over the top to the floor at one point.
""Wrestling Challenge"" May '88

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Honky Tonk Man - Warrior came straight to the ring right after Honky at the start not only working him over around the ring but also getting his shot in on Jimmy Hart on the outside before Hart's assistance on more than one occasion was able to give Honky the advantage he needed before their intentions became clear it was more important to not just win but hurt Warrior as well.
Oct. '88

vs. Intercontinental Champion Rick Rude - Warrior came out very aggressive taking Rude over the top rope & bouncing his head on each side of the ring apron in the opening seconds while heavily working over the lower back with hard whips in the corner & a bear hug before Rude was able to take advantage of an opening working over Warrior's midsection & lower back area using all his weight & submissions like the reverse chinlock along with other moves like a piledriver that hurt his own back as they traded momentum until things got so out of control that it couldn't be contained in the ring with not just Warrior & Rude getting a piece of the action.
May '89

w/Jim Duggan vs. Rick Rude & Andre The Giant - Warrior & Duggan showed their team unity in their own special ways before the match & what they did to Rude to take advantage of a mistiming between him & Andre before illegal tactics allowed the Heenan Family to single out one man with Andre utilizing his size advantage along with Rude's technical skills along with various illegal tactics & double teaming causing their opponents to fight ""fire with fire"" in a fun tag match.
June '89

vs. John Weiss - Another quick match where Warrior was so dominate that he didn't even bother removing his Intercontinental Championship.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Sept. '89

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - Andre caught Warrior early then worked him over in the corner by either pounding or choking him repeatedly only for Warrior to eventually attempt to return the choking with his own hands & using clotheslines to knock Andre off his feet only for Andre to keep stopping Warrior's momentum dead with bear hugs & nerve holds in what was a very slow paced match.
Oct. '89

vs. Brooklyn Brawler - Another dominate match by Warrior that I can only describe in two words, ""don't blink.""
""Wrestling Challenge"" Mar. '90

WWE Championship Match vs. Haku - This was Warrior's first televised title defense as Haku attempted to attack once Warrior got in the ring to no avail as Warrior took control repeatedly knocking Haku off his feet & to the outside multiple times before Haku was able to catch Warrior coming in working him over repeatedly giving offense that took Warrior off his feet in what was a short match but solid match.
""Saturday Nights Main Event"" Apr. '90

vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This was a rematch from the Royal Rumble earlier in the year as Warrior was dominate early slamming Slaughter off the top rope then constantly knocking him down & to the outside causing Slaughter to resort to dirty tactics along with Gen. Adnan & Col. Mustafa on the outside to regain the advantage & heavily focus on working over Warrior's back as the biggest story behind this match was not only who else decided to come to ringside but what they brought with them that was a big distraction to Warrior.
""Saturday Nights Main Event"" Apr. '91
[Bonus Disc of Self Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior]

vs. Rick Martel - Warrior started out very dominate using his power to keep knocking Martel down & to the outside to the point where Martel had to use Warrior's own momentum against him to gain an advantage focusing on the back with offense like the backbreaker & his trademark Boston Crab along with other tactics on the outside in a short match but Martel telling a good story in that limited time.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Apr. '91

vs. Smash - Warrior came out very aggressive taking Smash down repeatably in different ways before Smash was able to catch a break taking Warrior down & keeping him down with strikes while working on the throat & chest area along with Mr. Fuji on the outside making his presence known as well.
""Superstars"" May '91

vs. Skinner - Skinner attempted to get the early advantage spitting his tobacco into Warrior's eyes right away only for Warrior to shrug it off & get very aggressive both in & outside of the ring in a very quick dominate match to the point where he literally beat the tobacco out of Skinner.
""Superstars"" May '92

vs. Papa Shango - Warrior came out more aggressively than he usually is in this match taking Shango out the ring right away & bouncing his head off the steps along with relying with his usual power offense while Shango being able to get momentum taking advantage of an opening attempting to work him over & slow him down with moves like a nerve hold.
May '92

w/Randy Savage vs. Nasty Boys - Savage & Warrior were scheduled to be opponents for the upcoming WWF Championship Match at SummerSlam but there were rumors of Mr. Perfect being in one of their corners for that match resulting in neither man being able to trust each other to the point where the referee had to make the decision of who started the match as both Savage & Warrior were able to dominate one or both opponents individually but kept having verbal arguments against each other which the Nastys were able to eventually take advantage of singling out one man to work over including using illegal tactics before things broke down into more chaos causing more confusion of who's side Mr. Perfect was really on.
""SummerSlam Spectacular"" Aug. '92

vs. Isaac Yankem D.D.S. - This was the in-ring ""RAW"" debut of Warrior with Jerry Lawler not only in Yankem's corner but still had his headset on to do commentary as well in what was a quick dominate performance by Warrior.
""RAW"" Apr. '96

vs. Owen Hart - Warrior was able to take advantage of Owen using his own momentum against him in the early moments while using his trademark offense of clotheslines & shoulderblocks & slams along with using his own power to reverse Owen's attempt at offense before Owen was able to take advantage of an opening working on grounding Warrior by any method including some illegal tactics including Jim Cornette being involved on the outside in a solid match but more significant for being Warrior's last televised match in his WWE career.
""RAW"" July '96

(Blu-Ray) vs. Rick Rude - It should be noted that Gary Hart was the manager of Warrior while Percy Pringle III was the manager of Rude as not only Rude & Warrior had a staredown before the match but the managers did too as the wrestlers kept playing a game of ""can you top this"" with them delivering the same offense to different effects along with having an arm wrestling challenge in the middle of the match as they traded momentum with one man being dominate with power & the other using any tactic he could as this match ended when tensions boiled over that just couldn't be contained anymore.
""WCCW"" Aug. '86

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic.
It should be noted that the version of this match presented has no commentary & is completely shown through the ""hard camera"" angle only so it's a different presentation than previously seen (similar to Hogan/Andre from WrestleMania III on the ""History Of WWE"" DVD set).
Wrestlemania VI
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; History Of The WWE Championship; Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection]

(Blu-Ray) w/Legion Of Doom vs. Demolition - Warrior & L.O.D. were dominate early working over each member of Demolition individually easily overpowering them before Demolition was able to take advantage of a mistimed move cutting the ring off singling out one opponent keeping him in their corner for double & triple teaming on the inside & outside of the ring in what was a back & forth contest between both teams.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Oct. '90

(Blu-Ray) vs. Earthquake - Earthquake tried to get the jump on Warrior behind while it took Warrior more power than usual to take him down as they traded momentum with Earthquake was taking advantage of a distraction to heavily slow down the pace working over a section of Warrior's body using his natural power while also repeatably dropping his weight onto it while Warrior relied on his trademark offense but had to do more than usual for it to have an effect due to Earthquake's massive size.
Feb. '91

(Blu-Ray) w/Undertaker vs. Papa Shango & Berzerker - Warrior & Undertaker had a standoff with each other based off their past issues a year earlier before both men focused on their opponents with both teams using the same strategy of singling out one opponent with Warrior & Taker working him over both in & outside of the ring at a fast pace while Shango & Berzerker attempted to slow the pace down & trying to keep their opponent grounded along with resorting to dirty tactics such as illegal participants getting involved in the match in what was a basic tag match.
June '92

DVD extras include over 2 hours of interviews & promos along with his Hall Of Fame induction & final appearance on RAW after WrestleMania 30.  Blu-Ray Extras include bonus stories & footage such as the ""match"" between Natayla & Warrior's daughter Matt, his family being presented the Slammy Award, and the Warrior tribute on the TV show ""The Goldbergs"", and Batista's tribute to Warrior.

6928935,4,B00RDTK43E,"I pre-ordered this DVD, and received it the day of release, kudos to Amazon, that was crazy fast.

This DVD alone, isn't spectacular if your wanting matches.  You have to buy ""The Ultimate Collection"" to really fill in the blanks.  If you are like me you also have the ""Self Destruction"" DVD which even though a crucifixion piece has comments from other WWE(F) performers of the day along with Warrior promos, which regardless of what anyone will claim were awesome.  Anyone remember any Earthquake promo's?  Maybe Brain Busters?  Didn't think so.  Hell I can't even recall a Sting promo that stands out.  These (3) DVD's all kind of work together.  This alone is not complete.  Match wise its more less unreleased gems from his heyday.  The memorable clashes are on the others.  The documentary is the real sell point for this DVD, it is more less an extended version of the ""Ultimate Legend"" show played on the WWE Network after his death.  It worth owning, though I waited for other WWE performers to do commentary and there was none save Hogan, whom is also pro-Hogan career.  Overall great, if you have vast interest in his family life the extended ending of his daughter in the ring with Natalia is quiet interesting.  If you are looking for WWE to do a mass apology on camera it isn't happening but they still do right by the guy.",1429142400,,1337,4.629787234042553

6928937,4,B00RDTK43E,"This 3 disk collection is a great addition to any Warrior collection.
Disk 1 Features a documentary of Warriors life and legacy. This is actually the same video that WWE released last year on the WWE Network (Warrior: The Ultimate Legend) but with added footage and interviews from his family. Ultimately, if you've seen the original video online, you'll know what to expect. But the extra footage was still very awesome. We get to hear from his wife and his daughters about their life since his death and how the WWE has supported them. What I really like about this movie is the fact that it brings up the good and the bad, the ups and downs (lawsuits). A really great production
Disk 2 and 3 are a collection of Ultimate Warrior matches and interviews. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because this doesn't add much to the previously released Ultimate Collection DVD. There are some great matches and hours of entertainment, but only a handful of matches I haven't seen before. Also, one major issue I have is that it is not in chronological order. This was frustrating. Also, for the best feature (Wrestlemania 6 stadium cam) you have to buy the Blu-Ray. So that was a let down.

So enough with the negative, this was a lot of fun to watch and very informative. I'm glad the WWE has produced this and made his legacy truly legitimate. He will always be the most intense character you will ever see in the ring.

I was looking forward to last years ultimate collection but to me really slacked alot on the documentary. This one surely makes up for it. This was definatly the best WWE documentary that they have ever done. It went so in depth on his life and his career and his finally moments here on earth. Near the end of the documentary gets really emotional. Its totally worth the price alone. The matches and interviews are great to see again. Makes me feel like a kid watching it all over again. Highly recommended and if your a Warrior fan this is a MUST have! One Warrior Nation forever!!!!!,1428969600,2,670,4.368

ultimateWarrior (born James Brian Hellwig; June 16, 1959  April 8, 2014) was an American professional wrestler, who most famously wrestled under the ring name The Ultimate Warrior for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) from 1987 to 1991 and again in 1992 and 1996. During his 1998 stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), he was known as The Warrior. Before WWF, he was known in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) as Dingo Warrior.",1508630400,,501,4.9523809523809526
8695101,2,B00RDTK43E,"This dvd set was a disappointment to me,i am giving it 2 stars strictly because of the documentary on the first disc which i really enjoyed,it was nice finding out more about Warrior and it was also very cool seeing how much his family meant to him as well as his induction into the Wwe Hall of Fame..However the other 2 discs in this set are bad (in my opinion) although the second disc has matches that he was involved with from his early days in wrestling to later on in his career there are no iconic matches and to make matters worse the third disc is for the most part just promos along with interviews with Gene Okerlund to promote upcoming matches and appearances on things (for lack of a better word) On The Brother Love Show.",1508457600,,735,4.333333333333333

8695103,5,B00RDTK43E,This blu-ray dvd was everything I expected. You can not help but feel the pain of Dana and her girls when they talk about Warrior. I am a big fan of his and so was my mother. They only died two months apart so I can only imagine what his wife and daughters may feel. Warrior's spirit will live on through his fans and his girls.,1487980800,,328,3.984848484848485
8695104,3,B00RDTK43E,"I have been a fan of The Ultimate Warrior for 25+ years. As a child, he inspired me and embodied my dreams and the energy to make them reality.
As an adult, I rediscovered Jim Hellwig on his Youtube channel which was AMAZINGLY inspiring. However, this dvd starts with a BRUTAL 15 minutes of his wife Dana sobbing. While her grief is true and justified, it was so real and heavy it made me feel so sad that I didn't watch the rest of the dvd.
I understand, the passing of a loved one is impossibly hard...however, the pain was so real and raw that after watching the intro I didn't want to continue. WAAAAAY too heavy. The intro would have been better at the end of the dvd. Tons of love for Warrior and his family but the ultra heavy depressing part should have been at the end.",1480464000,,778,4.228187919463087
