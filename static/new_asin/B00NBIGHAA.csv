6637822,4,B00NBIGHAA,"Rented this for my 3 1/2 yr old son, who is obsessed with all things John Deere right now. He loves it. He's trying to memorize the songs and watches it as many times as we will let him. If your kid likes tractors and farms, this is a no brainer.",1425427200,,246,3.843137254901961

8677236,5,B00NBIGHAA,"I asked my 5 year old why he like it and this was his response: ""It's super cool because it has tractors in it, and it has a 1943 tractor in it!  There is a cool moving tractor that can lift up and it will only take 2 seconds to build it.""",1485734400,,239,3.5961538461538463

8677242,1,B00NBIGHAA,"I should have been more aware of the content of this video.  I expected to see John Deere tractors at work as a learning tool for my 5 year old, but the farm equipment seen was little to none; it's all about bees, horses, and apples.  I can see a 2-3 year old liking this and relating to the cheesy songs, but not above that age group.",1444608000,,335,3.985074626865672
