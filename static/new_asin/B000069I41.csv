1735799,5,B000069I41,"The Wilde Girls is a movie about a woman's secret past. Starring Olivia Newton-John as ""Jasmine""; and her daughter Chloe Rose as ""Izzy"". This is Chloe's feature length film debut. It is a bittersweet story of a single mother trying to raise a daughter. Jasmine was a loose woman, she did drugs, she played around, she got pregnant...and she was a popular singer. She assumes all responsibility for her wild past...and is determined to raise her daughter right.
  Fortunately...or unfortunately, Izzy turns out to be just like her mother. She dreams of one day being a singer. An apple does not fall too far from the apple tree. Jasmine is determined not to allow Izzy to make the same mistakes she once did. She tries to persuade her child that the music industry is cruel and unusual and that it is because of this inherent evil that she left it all behind, for a simpler, more rewarding life. She also tells Izzy that her father chose to remain in that world...rather than to be with her.
  Jasmine eventually reaches the conclusion that as a loving mother she must allow her child to figure out for herself what she wants to do with her life. This revelation inspires her to write and perform a new song, ""Trust Yourself"". Worth listening to.
  Izzy faithfully follows in her mothers footsteps and performs an interesting rendition of ""Rockin Robbin"", much to Jasmine's delight. Izzy is discovered and follows her dreams to Los Angeles. She has several misadventures and meets her father for the first time. She decides that she is not ready for Los Angeles...yet, and that she likes her father. She invites him...to fly back home with her...in order to surprise Jasmine.
  Oh! There truely is a ""Kodak"" moment in this film. It is the final scene where Jasmine, Izzy and her father all perform a song together. That moment unfolds when you can see the natural relationship between mother and daughter...between Olivia and Chloe. Olivia does something...with her hands...a simulation of flight. I can just see the joy on her face. I loved that part.",1044576000,2,2051,4.790368271954674
1735800,5,B000069I41,"For those of us with an affection for olivia newton john, any new project is a treat we can count on from this most credible performer. This lovely movie features olivia with her truly talented daughter chloe rose. The subject and story is humorous, heartwarming and quite simply entertaining. It is so much fun to see this mother/daughter coming of age responsibly themed movie with campy humor. The movie luckily features olivia doing what she does best, singing live with what is probably the purest voice in pop history. Highlights include a beautiful self-penned duet with her daughter and fun scenes such as an in-charactor -depressed livvy in pigtails, watching trash daytime tv binging on junk food. ...somehow seeing oreo cookies in that famous smile can make you fall in love with olivia all over again. The girl next door, the sexy powerful survior, an artist and a lady. For many, a guilty pleasure, but after all, she's been part of our entertainment families since she slipped into black leather in grease. I've watched it 5 times on showtime and the video is now on order. Go ahead, she's the one that we want",1034467200,11,1124,4.798969072164948
1735801,4,B000069I41,"Well, Olivia has taken part in some pretty impressive productions, but the production of her daughter is surely one of the best.  Chloe is quite a talent and her musical performances in the movie are on the same paar as a young Mariah Carey.  She is sincere and multi-dimensional in her performance which enhances an otherwise so-so film.  Swoosie Kurtz is at her comic best as the brassy best friend to Olivia, who of course is unforgettable in any role.  A bright start to Chloe's professional career and a fun time with Olivia and Swoosie.  It deals with some good issues about growing up, following a dream, taking drugs, single parenthood, and relizing our parents had lives before they were our parents.  All in all, a must see for everyone ages 13+.
For those fans of Olivia Newton-John, there is a brief return in the movie to the same boardwalks featured in her rollerskating scenes in ""Xanadu"" as well as some stellar performances by her.  Chloe gives some great performances of ""Rockin Robin"", ""At Last"", and other songs.  Olivia sounds better than ever singing ""Trust Yourself"" and ""You Loved Me Into It.""",1033603200,7,1117,4.78125

7966078,5,B000069I41,"As a Olivia Newton John Fan since seeing Grease at 7 years old I think this movie was great.  I will watch and buy anything that she is involved with.  She is such an inspiration to us all.  The first time I saw Chloe was on ""A Christmas Romance.""  She has grown into a beautiful, talented girl who I hope to hear music from someday.  I liked the chemistry they had on screen.  I guess it is not a stretch to play mother and daughter when you do it every day.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  It is a great story with some good messages.",1133308800,,540,4.028301886792453
7966079,5,B000069I41,"This movie i find very great! Olivia Newton-John is wonderful in this movie and her real life daughter is also great! But this is what the movie is about: Jasmine Wilde (OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN) is a single mother living in Georgia trying to raise her daughter Izzy (CHLOE ROSE) in a normal American setting, while keeping secret her past as a famous singer. However, it's really Jasmine that Dan is interested in watching perform, and for the sake of her daughter, Jasmine gets up on stage only to fail miserably. Just as Dan is leaving, Izzy takes the stage and her amazing performance stops Dan in his tracks and he asks her to come to Los Angeles to record in a real studio. Jasmine is adamant about not letting Izzy go to Los Angeles, but when Izzy discovers teen magazines with her mother's face on the cover, Jasmine's long- kept secret is revealed. She was once a very popular singer, and she explains to her daughter that the cruel world of the music business made her leave for a more simple life. Izzy also learns that her father was a musician but he decided to pursue his music career instead of raising a child. This news only encourages Izzy to pursue her singing career even more. With a great deal of convincing, Jasmine finally lets Izzy go to Los Angeles.

While they are in the big city, Jasmine contacts Izzy's father and she introduces him to Izzy for the first time. Jasmine brings him to the recording studio while Izzy is in the middle of a recording session and emotions run high. While it's a bittersweet reunion for Jasmine, she realizes that she must return to Georgia and let Izzy stay in Los Angeles with Sierra to figure out on her own what she wants out of a career. When Jasmine returns home, the experience compels her to write a new song ""Trust Yourself.""

After a couple of lonely nights in Los Angeles and a strong dose of reality, Izzy decides that the music world can wait. She asks her father to secretly fly back with her to Georgia to surprise Jasmine.",1098576000,6,1990,4.509695290858725

7966081,4,B000069I41,"This was a good movie, although I think Olivia Newton-John needs to quit making Dale Shores movies. Jasmine Wilde (ONJ) is a one hit wonder who is now working in an animal shelter. Her daughter Issy (Chloe Rose Lattinzi, who is her real life daughter) wants to become a singer and go to Hollywood to record. She does not know about her mother's success, but finds out after she finds some magazines in her mothers's closet with Jasmine on the cover.
Olivia and Chloe are both great in this movie, (Although Chloe didn't inherrit talents as great as Olivia's) and any Olivia Newton-John should see this one. The movie was filmed ""on location"" in Australia, even though it was supposed to be in Georgia and Hollywood. Good movie, Great Olivia. She alson sings the song, Trust Yourself, which she wrote, and playes it on the guitar.",1058486400,2,829,4.684931506849315
