8211061,4,B000TUWPFY,"The daughter (Setsuko Hara) of a leftist professor (Denjiro Okochi) in prewar Japan is drawn toward the dangerous but idealistic life of an antiwar revolutionary, and her convictions are tested when she must face the bitter consequences.

This remarkable film, made in 1946, is surprisingly critical of the militarists who led Japan into the war.  (Or perhaps it's not so surprising; for all I know, American Occupation authorities may have been actively promoting such material.)  It is an early example of director Akira Kurosawa's strengths as a maker of powerful, humanistic dramas, this one with a strong feminist theme.  Hara excels as the young woman who lives vicariously through the passion of her father and his idealistic students until their movement is crushed.  It then falls upon her to seek meaning in her own life, a journey that will lead to much hardship.  Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura makes a brief but chilling appearance as a police inspector.",1278374400,,969,5.140127388535032
8211062,4,B000TUWPFY,"I sat down to watch ""No Regrets for Our Youth"" last night and, after the first two thirds of the movie, I really started to wonder if this film would even be available if it wasn't for its' illustrious director, Akira Kurosawa.  The movie up to that point was fairly bland stuff although the idea that Kurosawa could make such a movie in Japan in 1946 certainly gave me pause to wonder. Some of the shots showed brilliance but mostly I had the feeling that there wasn't a lot to this movie.  Then, after a series of significant events, the film takes a dramatic turn and, lo and behold, becomes a most memorable movie.  Without giving up the plot, I would describe the change as that of a younger person who idealistically sets forth on a mission.  This individual soon realizes the extent of her sacrifice of comfort and security.  She also realizes that no one seems to appreciate what she is doing.  We see the doubts within her but mostly, we see the extent of her hardships.  Kurosawa's excellence in ""No Regrets for Our Youth"", for me, was in his method of showing the hardships and suffering of our heroine.  I felt exhausted just watching those scenes and that underscored all the more the relationship between who she was and who she was becoming.  In the end we were happy with the transformation because she was as well.

This movie focusses on one individual yet we really don't sense who that person is until we've gone the distance.  Others had their dreams and some realized a part of them but our focus is on the one we sensed to be the least likely to suceed.  Was this Kurosawa's bold message to his countryman that the politics have come and gone.  It is the people, not the idealogues, who will save Japan.  I was moved by this movie.  It was, indeed, a movie worth watching all the way through.",1211846400,,1815,4.474164133738602
8211063,4,B000TUWPFY,"I could hardly believe the actress playing the mercurial Yukie would soon be playing the serene and self-effacing Noriko in Yasujiro Ozu's home drama classics such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Early-Summer/dp/B00026L7MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Early Summer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>. Such was Setsuko Hara's versatility and malleability that she could move easily between Ozu's saintly goddess and Akira Kurosawa's passionate, reluctant heroine in this 1946 anti-war melodrama. In his first post-WWII film and the only one he ever made focused on a female protagonist, Kurosawa (with co-writer Eijir Hisaita) has fashioned an emotionally ripe, politically charged and time-spanning story around Yukie, the daughter of a college professor, a one-time idealist who loses his job in face of the growing fascism engulfing Japan in 1933. Beautiful and skating precariously on the surface of her life, she finds herself caught between two men, both former students of her father - Noge, the son of peasant rice farmers, who becomes a secretive anti-war activist, and Itokawa, the conservative prosecutor and a symbol of the passive conformity that allowed Japan to enter a no-win war.

Yukie is excited by Noge's political passion, and they begin an intense, inevitably short-lived affair. When Noge goes to prison, she becomes politically enlightened to Japan's oppressive state, and after he dies, she decides to take his ashes to his parents and stay with them to work the fields. She endures a great deal of hardship, both from his uncaring parents and neighbors, who harass the family of a ""traitor"". Against the odds, Yukie endures and triumphs and despite a brief sojourn back to Kyoto, realizes her life is far more fulfilling with the peasants. Much of the plot is rather convoluted and the storyline jumpy, as the politically motivated Kurosawa seems more interested in drawing certain emotional responses from the viewer. Clarity is only a secondary consideration here, as he busily applies much of the visual flair that he would exhibit with greater impact in his later masterworks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B000G8NXYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>.

Even at this early stage in his directorial career (it's only his fifth film), there are a number of his stylistic touches evident - a series of quick freeze shots to illustrate Yukie's traumatized response behind a closed door to Noge's surprise departure; the use of a slow exposure camera that causes an unearthly (and sometimes irritating) blurring effect when people are in motion; people lying in a pastoral setting staring skywards (mimicked recently by Chinese filmmakers like Yimou Zhang); Yukie's oddly exaggerated, out-of-sync piano playing; and large crowds rushing down steps in an Eisenstein-like manner. However, the film gains real emotional heft toward the end when Yukie struggles in the rice fields with Noge's mother (played almost unrecognizably by another Ozu regular, Haruko Sugimura) under Yukie's mantra of the dead husband/son, ""No regrets in my life, no regrets whatsoever"". It's a moving sequence which brings the story to its resonant conclusion.

Proving why she was one of Japan's favorite post-WWII film stars, Hara is superb in showing Yukie's initial flightiness and evolving political consciousness. The other performances are reasonable but hardly as memorable - Susumu Fujita as Noge, Akitake Kono as Itokawa (whom Yukie rejects at the end as unworthy to know where Noge's grave is due likely to his pro-war stance) and Denjiro Okochi as Yukie's father. The combination of the illustrious Kurosawa and the incandescent Hara is certainly compelling enough to warrant viewing.",1208304000,,4084,6.173989455184534
8211064,5,B000TUWPFY,"I first saw this wonderful Kurosawa treasure when I was a teenager...and I was stunned.  For a Japanese film completed in 1946,  I did not expect it to be so political, so  anti-imperialistic. Just a year earlier, most Japanese soldiers still worshipped the Emperor and offered their lives uncompromisingly for his glory.

From one point of view, this is a love story. Yukie is a beautiful daughter of a professor of law at Kyoto University.  Her suitors are two men. One is Noge who is an outspoken political idealist. The other is Itokawa, a decent man, but one willing to compromise his ideals so as not to offend the authorities.  As Yukie explains it, if she chooses Noge, her life will be dazzling and stormy; if she chooses Itokawa, her life will be comfortable but boring.  She chooses Noge.

It is not an easy choice because both her parents prefer an easy life for their daughter.  That is not HER way.  Thus, this film is one of the few
proto-feminist pictures in Japan, and certainly ""the feminist oevre"" of Akira Kurosawa.  We witness Yukie's personal development from a spoiled girl to a woman willing to risk incredible hardship to be independent ... a nd to be true to Noge and his memory...(he is imprisoned as a spy for distribuing anti-war pamphlets).

Not only is this film an impressive feminist piece, but a strong statement in any language for freedom of expression.  And the heroine -played by Setsuko Hara - could not be more believable.  This is a wonderful, moving film experience. It's a shame that so many Kurosawa fans are unaware of it.",1187049600,7,1567,4.6923076923076925
