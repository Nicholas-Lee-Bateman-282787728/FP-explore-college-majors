7840407,3,6303129021,"Although I always love to watch Tom Selleck walk around in shorts, this was not my favorite espiode. Murder She Wrote and Magnum are two great shows, hooowever, the writers of this particular espiode doees not capture  either actor magic. ""Murder On Ice"" was much better. Also anyone  who may want to see this espiode may like to check out A&E on cable,  they are carrying the Magnum reruns.",964137600,3,391,4.63768115942029
7840408,5,6303129021,"What another great episode in the magnum series I'm alsolooking to track down the episode ""magnum on ice"" as all fans of the show know that the episode follows on from novel connection, just a great shame that  all the magnum episodes are not available so i can complete my collection,  i can't be the only one out there who thinks this, come on amazon please  help us!",947721600,8,369,4.397058823529412
