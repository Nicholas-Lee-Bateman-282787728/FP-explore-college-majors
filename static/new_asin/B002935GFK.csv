8357353,3,B002935GFK,I didn't watch the entire DVD. I bought it for my 7-year old granddaughter who loves butterflies.  It seems a bit beyond her and didn't hold her interest.  Too bad.  Maybe when she gets older she'll like it.,1415750400,,207,4.394736842105263
8357354,5,B002935GFK,"This DVD is just plain awesome!  I help Mother Nature with this butterfly and the black swallowtail.  They are so much fun and nature is absolutely amazing.  You must plant Milkweed for the Monarchs --- that's all the mother lays her eggs on and then the caterpillars eat.  Please, please plant milkweed.  The Monarchs are disappearing and they are just too pretty to not save.  If we all work together, maybe we can help.",1394323200,2,422,4.635135135135135

Butterflies ARE my tiny heroes, especially when you see their journey every year, for hundreds of years.  Shame on ya if'n you don't see this terrific film!",1367107200,2,330,4.466666666666667

8357358,5,B002935GFK,"I saw this on Nova recently and was so fascinated I didn't even blink during the whole thing! I'm giving it to my grand-daughter ( if I can part with it) because it is so well done and the story so Incredible! Makes you think - ""if a butterfly can do this, I can do anything""",1265328000,5,275,3.9285714285714284
8357359,5,B002935GFK,"This was a wonderful, educational documentary of the life cycle and migration habits of the butterfly.  Many of them stop here in NJ and it's interesting to know how our stopping point fits in with the scheme of this cycle.",1264464000,9,223,4.575
