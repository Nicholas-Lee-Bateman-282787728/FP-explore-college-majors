7855230,3,6303873499,"This is not, as it is listed, a documentary but rather simply an uninterrupted showing of teasing trailers for the first 15 films featuring the Ian Fleming creation, James Bond, from the first, ""Doctor No"", through the final and most stale of the seven that star Roger Moore, ""A View To A Kill"", along with an additional couple of stills from the brace of works with Timothy Dalton as the English agent. Worth of this grouping of clips will be to those who count themselves as students of the Bond canon and to those others who collect trailers, as there is naught else here in the way of content, with the footage moving along smartly, although with anomalies included such as music from the British television series ""The Avengers"" upon occasion serving in lieu of the correct Monty Norman theme. Numbly viewing this parade of tidbits from fantasy adventures gives one a significant impression of a variance in quality that naturally mirrors the films themselves; early works, in particular the pair that stand well above the others - ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Goldfinger"" - are herewith promoted with the characters of the ""Gentleman Agent"" and his evil adversaries to the fore, in utter contrast to the succession of stuntmen's bagatelles that followed throughout the productions with Moore that are probably of scant interest to those not in thrall to technological gimmicks, car crashes and explosions.",1152489600,,1411,4.983050847457627
