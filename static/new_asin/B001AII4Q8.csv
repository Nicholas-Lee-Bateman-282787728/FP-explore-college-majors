If this is the full screen version, I STRONGLY recommend waiting until the widescreen version releases (and it will).",1218585600,2,268,4.153846153846154
3449931,5,B001AII4Q8,"This complete what Transformer and Roll Out left. Great character, great history and fun to watch. I can't wait for season 3 and the release of the 2nd Season on DVD. Excellent for all kids and for the truly Transformers fans",1218326400,4,225,4.512195121951219
3449932,5,B001AII4Q8,"People keep complaining that this set is missing the first 3 episodes. This is not true, as ""Home is Where the Spark is"" IS the first episode. Transform and Roll Out was produced AS A MOVIE, and was only split into episodes for reruns.

This season also has several great episodes, such as Blast from the Past (Introducing the Dinobots), Thrill of the Hunt, and my favorite, Sound and Fury, introducing my favorite character, Soundwave.",1218326400,17,436,4.8133333333333335
3449933,4,B001AII4Q8,"My 5yr. old loves the Transformers so he looks forward to watching this show everyday. I think it is a shame that season #1 will not have the entire collection of shows, this DVD Set will start on episode #4 which kinda Sucks! If it is the complete season then it should have every episode on there plain & simple.",1215907200,3,314,4.25
3449934,4,B001AII4Q8,"This boxset will include the remaining 13 episodes out of 16.  You must buy the ""Transform and Roll Out"" dvd if you want the pilot.

3449967,4,B001AII4Q8,"Transformers Animated is the most recent Transformers cartoon series, and, while it is a little kiddish, it retains the good old-fashioned Transformers feel to it.

There are a few episodes that were a little annoying--especially the ones with the pathetic human villains, which I felt are unnecessary.
My other big problem with Sari (besides her obnxious behavior) is that she has a Deus ex machina Key that fixes everything throughout the series. Even though the Key has side effects, it does not detain Sari from constantly (irresponsibly) using it throughout the series.

The Autobots are adjusting to Earth's ways with the help of a little human girl named Sari (who is, IMO, a spoiled brat--give me Spike any day!), while the Deceptions are mostly just looking for Megatron (and the AllSpark).

 All of these characters have personalities. Optimus Prime is as protective as ever, Bumblebee is chatty and childlike, Prowl is as serious as ever, and even the Decepticons have personality. One Decepticon in particular has (literally) three personalities!

There are some other Transformers that show including a certain spider from a certain Beast Wars and Sound Wave.

This series has humor and action. I highly recommend it (as long as you do not mind the annoying humans, especially Sari).",1238716800,,1296,5.147619047619048
3449968,3,B001AII4Q8,"The episodes are OK at best.  I compare them to the first the first two seasons of the SIMPSONS; Homer has the ""different"" voice and Bart is the main character.  Here, Optimus Prime sounds ""funny,"" Megatron does not look the same, Starscream is nowhere and they all work with and fight with humans.  I know the later seasons will be much better.",1237766400,,345,4.532258064516129
3449969,5,B001AII4Q8,"Santa brought this to my son this year and he loves it.  I appreciate that the 5 hours of programming are split onto 2 discs, so I have a little control of the hours spent watching what felt like ""lost episodes"" to us - because of not being awake at 7:30 am on Saturday mornings to watch them.",1231372800,,293,4.051724137931035
3449970,5,B001AII4Q8,"Everything I said about ""Transformers Animated: Transform and Roll Out"" I also say about this DVD.  I can't wait to see Season 2 and all future seasons.",1224288000,,152,4.62962962962963
3449971,5,B001AII4Q8,"Season one of Transformers Animated was good. Season 2 was better.
Every one think's the season one set is missing 3 ep's. IT's Not. The first 3 ep's were the Tv movie. Season1 of TF Animated is Season One.
I like how this show is a remake of the frist Transformer show.",1224288000,,270,4.211538461538462
3449972,3,B001AII4Q8,"Overall, this is an enjoyable series, but I do have two complaints.

The first is just a matter of taste. I am not a huge fan of the style of drawing used in this series. Far too many cartoons these days are  regressing to this simplictic, childish style of animation. The stories, however, are good enough to help overlook this and the type humor in the show would likely not work as well with more realistic artwork.

My bigger complaint if in the depiction of Optimus Prime himself. There is no sense (at least where I am at, just finishing disk one) that he is in fact the leader of the group. Without Bumblebee calling him ""Bossbot"", and the history of the whole Transformers franchise, you would think of him as just another member of the group, and not a particularly major one. He is weak, unsure of himself, and is not commanding. As a huge fan of Prime, this was a major let down.

On a postitive note, I very much like the Prowl in this version, and Megatron, though just a head so far, has an air of menace that he lacked in the orginal G1 series.",1223510400,8,1059,4.306532663316583
3449973,1,B001AII4Q8,"This show looks cheap and let's face it they don't even look like robots! It shouldn't even be called Transformers! I keep waiting for the next episode in which they fight Bob the Builder or the Teletubbies. Seriously how can anyone like how these ""robots"" look with their bad proportions and sloppy looking style? Stay away from this one and hopefully one day we will get a Transformer show with good writing AND looks cool.",1222732800,3,425,4.68
3449974,5,B001AII4Q8,A Classic animation come back with new look and new story! You can't miss it!!,1221523200,2,78,4.266666666666667

8277603,5,B001AII4Q8,I ordered this dvd for my boys when they were super into transformers and they use to watch it over and over,1397001600,,108,3.9545454545454546
8277604,5,B001AII4Q8,"I've loved every episode of this TF series and the characters have so much more personality than G1 ever did. I'm not bashing the original, but I've never laughed so hard at G1's 'humor' than in Animated. The plot in this version of Transformers runs a lot deeper and flows nicely. The action during the battles is amazing and having the main protagonists be rookies and work themselves up is a delightful change to the norm.

The characters are very likable and will grow quickly on you. Even Megatron himself and his cynicism will have you chuckling.

My only gripe about this DVD is that it's missing the pilot episodes. It's not a complete Season 1 set without ""Transform and Roll Out"". That's just money grubbing Hasbro for you. So, I'm forced to buy Transform and Roll Out to complete the first of my collection.

Next is to scrape up enough money to buy Seasons 2 and 3. Or hope the price lowers enough.

In any case, all Transformers fans should pick this series up one way or another. Get over your qualms about it being different and enjoy it!",1376956800,,1053,4.526315789473684
8277605,5,B001AII4Q8,"While I wasn't sure I would like this series, it is one that does grow on you if given a chance. Here, the rules are a little different, and Prime isn't at the top of the group as he was before. There are nods to G1 and the Movie here, and Prime's entourage has at least a new face in the form of Bulkhead. Prowl is a motorcycle rather than a police unit and is more of a ninja and Bumblebee is more of an outgoing character. This time, their base is Detroit and their sidekick is an outgoing girl named Sari Sumdac. The stories are much better in this series and while old faces do appear, it is not in the same way. Not only do the Autobots have to contend with Megatron, but with earthly villains as well and the contention between Starscream and Megatron here is much sharper and Starscream reveals a much more sinister side--although there are still moments of humor. It's not the old series, but one with a different approach.",1369526400,,932,4.301136363636363
8277606,5,B001AII4Q8,Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest,1355788800,,135,4.666666666666667
8277607,4,B001AII4Q8,It is a four star because disc two skips a little bit. But I enjoyed them. Blitzwing is my only favorite decepticon!,1354838400,,116,4.318181818181818
8277608,5,B001AII4Q8,"Transformers Animated is awesome! The Autobots have the Allspark&The Key which the Decepticons will  stop at nothing to posses. The Autobots find a human friend in Sari Sumdac,an 8-year old girl that plays a vital component of the team and keeper of The Key. Season 1 includes the introduction of some G1 favorites like The Dinobots,Soundwave,and my favorite Blackarachnia. This Decepticon vixen looks the best she ever has with straight up looks that kill. Blackarachnia is the best Decepticon fembot ever with one wicked cool spider mode that is one of the most realistic ever. Megatron is as menacing as ever for an excellent representation of the classic decepticon leader. Optimus Prime grows more into the leadership role as the series progresses. The battle scenes get more amazing as well with cool special effects. Starscream is his sinister self with schemeing plots all throughout the series to really keep the season interesting. Transformers Animated Season 1 is a thrill ride from start to finish that will please any transformer fan around. Bottom line Transformers Animated Season 1 has compelling storylines,amazing action,and awesome characters throughout the series that make this DVD a 10 out of 10 experience that all transformer fans will enjoy. I highly recommend Transformers Animated Season 1 to all transformer fans out there. Transformers Rule!!!",1328054400,,1373,5.3271889400921655
8277609,5,B001AII4Q8,"LOVE TFA!!! Nice to be able to watch the show without ads popping up! First few episodes are a little sloppy when it come to lip sync, but it gets better over time. Lovable characters, interesting story plots, and much needed comic relief! A must have for TFA fans! Only complaint is that the three T.V pilot episodes are not included. That needs to be bought separately.",1311465600,,371,4.552238805970149

8277611,4,B001AII4Q8,I grew up watching the original Transformers cartoon and have watched many of the subsequent cartoons that have followed.  This one is the first one that mixes the old series and puts a new twist on the characters.  My four year old loves this series and I am having a good time seeing him get excited about something I loved when I was a child.  The series is easy to follow and is very kid friendly.  There are references made throughout the show to the original cartoon. Originally I objected to the new direction of the show but it has grown on me and seeing that my son likes it is a huge plus.  I have bought many of the toys from this series for my son and he enjoys watching the show and playing with the toys while he watches.,1266537600,,735,4.184397163120567
