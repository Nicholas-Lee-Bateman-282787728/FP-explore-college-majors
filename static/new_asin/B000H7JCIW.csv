2630688,5,B000H7JCIW,"This show was one of the very best of its kind I have ever seen> Liza was at her top-notch best that night and this DVD has captured it in a rare moment of superb talent being reproduced by the technology of the day. Both are seldom seen with such clarity,color and sheer fun to watch. I confess I am prejudiced where Liza is concerned since the night I saw her live with Frank and Sammy. Nobody did it like Liza,even her moyher. Sadly,her demons threaten to overtake her now but buy this DVD and re-live one of the great moments in entertainment history.",1178928000,2,555,4.346153846153846
2630689,5,B000H7JCIW,"Liza gave an outstanding performance and her vocals were amazing. This was a concert of a lifetime Live from Radio City Music Hall.

The undeniable and magic conection Liza had with the audience was another sign of her great talent as a performer and singer. I am a huge fan of hers and her mother Judy Garland and I think Liza is one of the best performers in the music industry after her mother.

I have never seen a performer that fits right in with her audience like Liza did in this live concert. Her interaction with the people was just wonderful. She was born to sing and perform.

The New York, New York song was a winner in this concert. Liza's versatility to work with every song was superb and her more mature voice gave the audience the opportunity to have a real taste of talent. I only wished I was there to see her perform.",1169596800,10,838,4.32484076433121

2630691,5,B000H7JCIW,"Liza Minnelli's concerts are always an incredible showcase of her talents. Having seen her many times onstage, I think this concert is one of her all-time best. A highly imaginative and original show with great material and Liza in peak form. Watch the singing actress at work in SORRY I ASKED or QUIET LOVE and with all the women dancers in STEPPING OUT(where's the DVD of that underrated film?) This show makes one wish for DVD releases of her first HBO concert from 1979(once on video) and her second one from London(1985..never on video) not to mention her other TV specials.",1167782400,31,579,4.742574257425742
2630692,5,B000H7JCIW,"Like her legendary mother, nobody around today takes command of the stage like Liza Minnelli and this legendary event at New York's Radio City Music Hall clearly illustrates this...always a five star event in concert, I have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from 1970 to 2005 and I am here to say that she has still got it and always will!!! In recent years for some silly reason that I don't get, the media has tried to damage Liza's artistic credibility but it doesn't work when Liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary Superstar...numerous standing ovations later it is clear that Liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper...BRAVO Liza and keep on rocking!!!",1164240000,16,908,4.68125
2630693,3,B000H7JCIW,"Unbelievable. This is the third of Liza's Concerts on DVD
that I have seen. And I feel so luky to understand what
made ""LIZA"" an ICON, but in the last few years considered
more of a joke. But if you view ""LIZA WITH A Z"" and
""AZNAVOUR/MINNELLI"" and now ""Live from Radio City Music
Hall,"" which is practically a brand new show will see a top notch performance and production. t I was grateful to see ""Liza"" sing
""new standards"" and make a brand new production. ""Liza""
shines on all levels. She is at the top of her game and
the songs are excellent, as is ""liza's"" GREAT DANCING.
I've never saw a star who is so humble and it is overwhelming.

From production down to the choreography, to the songs
choosen (and yes you hear ""New York, New York"") is a 90
minute of pure greatness! LIZA WE MISS YOU!!!

Now I want to see and buy all other concerts that need
to be put on DVD from ""Liza."" I know there are at least
two out there filmed for cable that needs to be shown.
Because these concerts prove that she had the capabilities
and shined as one of our greatest performers. ""Barbra
Streisand"" is great, but she leaves me ""cold"" with her
personality. ""Liza leaves me in ""tears of happiness"" for
the willingness to sweat and work as hard as possible.

BUT PLEASE CABLE TELEVISION, give us the ""FULL CONCERTS""
that were filmed some years back. And no editing!!! Which
is what ""FOX STUDIOS"" DID with a VHS CONCERT. IF YOU
PUT ThE DVDS OUT with some publicity we will buy them!

A great concert and DVD. WORTH OWNING! And yes, Streisand
move over and share in the glory of being an ""ICON!""

My biggest regret is that she hasn't done many films.
I hope she does at least just one more to show how
dynamic she is.

*Though the review shows a 3 STAR Rating I don't understand
why for I gave this concert a 5 STAR Rating.",1162166400,6,1808,4.271929824561403
2630694,5,B000H7JCIW,"This concert took place shortly before Liza's health started to rapidly decline.  It looks as if she wanted to leave a final testimony of what she could achieve while she was still at the top of her game.  This should be a must-see for anyone pursuing a career in the performing arts.

And what a testimony this one is!  If you thought Liza with a ""Z"" was great, you'll love this one.  Liza took EVERTHING to the highest level of performance.  The singing.  The acting.  The dancing.  I was lucky to see this in person and there was a dance at the beginning of the concert (not included in any version) where Liza was the most beautiful, talented and graceful performer I had seen, or will ever see again, on stage.  Her total control of her movements and her technique were flawless.  A dubbed version of Losing my Mind is also missing from this DVD.

The only thing missing that I do not miss is the white modest blouse that covered the white outfit in the first act.  It did nothing for Liza.  Thank God it's gone!!!

I was going to mention the highlights of the show, but each song is a highlight!!!  So I'll just mention my favorite song: Here I'll Stay/Our Love is Here to Stay.  Minnelli is simply brilliant and totally believable.  I get goose bumps every time I hear this song.

The packaging is similar to the Laser Disc, VHS and the CD released at the time.  The visual quality is superb and the sound is perfect.  They even solved a couple of problems from the Laser Disc/VHS versions.  One of them was the synchronization between the image and the sound during the final verses of Seeing Things.  The other one is the transition from Liza's recorded voice into her ""live"" voice at the beginning of Here I'll Stay/Our Love is Here to Stay (The ""We've"" on ""We've got something permanent"").

Be advised that there are NO extras in this DVD.  Just Liza.  But somehow, that's more than enough.

Buy this DVD TODAY, before it disappears for 30 years like Liza with a ""Z"" did.",1160006400,15,1982,4.4484679665738165

2630715,5,B000H7JCIW,"This show, recorded at the famed Radio City Music Hall, captures Liza at her finest.  She has the beauty and energy of youth (46 years old when recorded) combined with the stage maturity required to be in full control.  Indeed, if you are familiar with her famous mother , Judy Garland, you will delight in seeing all the similarities in performance styles and mannerisms.

The production has all the elements of show-biz entertainment that one would expect including the funny, the trite, and sincerity that make for an enjoyable view.  She includes a small cast of her gal pals singing and dancing on the great stage.

It is on this great stage that she salutes her father, Vincent Minnelli, who was an early designer (costume / sets) at this famed music hall many years ago.  In this montage you will see his creative works from the past.  But perhaps you already know his work..... The famed Toy Soldier costume still worn today by the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes!

2630723,5,B000H7JCIW,"I saw the first performance of this show at Radio City. What a night! Celebrities galore, if that's your thing. But really the only reason anyone was inside Radio City that April night was Liza Minnelli. And she tore the roof off the place.

I am so glad this show was finally released on DVD and that it is still in stock on Amazon. It is one of many career peaks for this perennially underrated performer. Yes, I know, she's regarded as the diva of all time, but very often her incredible artistry is just given passing lip-service. This woman is superhumanly talented. She needs no bombast. No eye-piercing strobe effects. No silly back-up dancers to distract you from the fact she can't dance--because she CAN dance, and beautifully.

The first act alone was simply Liza. Alone on the vast Radio City stage. And nothing else was needed. First number: ""Teach Me Tonight."" Guts personified, then she was simply at home doing what she was born to do.

Liza Minnelli can do everything. There ain't many of her kind left (if there ever were to begin with).

She's touring again. If you can go see her live, DO IT. You won't regret it. I promise you.

This DVD (and the CD) would be great Christmas gifts for anyone who truly loves the performing arts. I am still thrilled I got to see Liza Minnelli: Live from Radio City Music Hall--""live""!",1290816000,,1339,4.5625

2630732,3,B000H7JCIW,"I love Liza. Was glad to see this one now on DVD. But, it looks like a 1:33 version stretched to widescreen. But, a few adjustments on my TV corrected it and made her look less fat-legged.

Halfway through she is on stage with what looks like the dancers from the Radio City Music hall where it was recorded. Aren't they called the Rockettes?

Well, that made the show and Liza sings ""New York, New York,"" while the other gals do a parody of Liza's songs while Liza looks on in amazement. It is on Amazon and hopefully some of her other concerts will soon be available too. I haven't bought Liza With a Z, yet. I keep forgetting to look for it, knowing it has been issued on DVD.",1253404800,,679,4.2153846153846155
2630733,5,B000H7JCIW,"The entire concert is absolutely wonderful.  The songs that keep going over and over in my head are So What? and Imagine.  Thank you, Ms. Minnelli.",1243814400,,147,4.615384615384615
2630734,4,B000H7JCIW,"Liza shines in this wonderful created concert/Special. One thing I really like about this DVD is that its not Liza trying to re-record her greatest hits. In this concert, she did yes, sing some of her classic hits. But most of the material sung in this concert where not typical Liza songs. Such examples would be ""Live Alone and Like It"", ""So What"", ""Sara Lee"", and ""The Men's Medley"" were all new great new songs for Liza to introduce into her songbook.

Their were although some things that I didn't like about this performance. I felt that at some spots through out the first act Liza is singing so low, and backing away from the power of the song's moment, and it becomes hard for you to understand what she is trying to sing. In other words you could say at some parts she seems to mumble. But through the second act she was totally fine, due to most of the songs in the second act were uptempo; Which brings me to my next pint.

Most of the songs in the First act were ballads. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with ballads, but In my opinion I think the first Act should have been longer, and started out with more up-tempos. Then after about maybe four up-tempos, then go into a pattern of ballads and up-tempos. Instead of doing ballads straight in a row. Like how the first act did at some points.

As for the second act, I think it was perfect. Especially for the Men's Medley, Liza and her dancer did a great job of incorporating so many different types of songs into this medley. The one thing I Did not like about the second act is this whole Bob Fosse, Imagine, Smile medley thing. I'm glad it wasn't in Liza With a Z because I felt it dragged on for way too long. It looked like Liza and her dancers were doing a very bad imitation of Liza's performance of Bye, Bye, Blackbird in Liza with a Z. Besides that, the second act was perfect. Some great songs were the ""Here I'll Stay Medley"" and ""The Man I Love""

I would DEFIANTLY recommend this to any Liza, Broadway, of showtunes fan. It is full or great numbers, and terrific dances.",1230336000,2,2050,4.344647519582246
2630735,5,B000H7JCIW,"It is an extraordinary  spectacle. Outstanding performance by Minelli, still in top form, singing, dancing.

Ensemble backing her is tops. So is music, lighting, choreography .

She was without a doubt  the outstanding ""One Woman Show""  star in the world, from the seventies to the early nineties.

I also recommend buying 'LIZA WITH A Z"", which was directed and choreographed by the great Bob Fosse.",1217721600,,400,5.076923076923077

I already owned this on VHS, and was so thankful that it has finally been released on DVD. This DVD does not have any extra features on it...just LIZA...and let me tell you, this performance speaks for itself! Liza and her Demon Divas put on one heck of a show! The show starts off kind of slow, unless you are a Liza fan like I am...then she starts singing Stepping Out and all people in the audience are glued to some crazy lady interrupting the show...What happens then is just one great production number with the Demon Divas and Liza.

Get this DVD while it is still available...you will not regret it!",1203379200,2,732,4.343065693430657
2630737,4,B000H7JCIW,"""Liza Live from Radio City Music Hall"" is an excellent live concert recording DVD that seems to suffer in undeserved obscurity alongside its beloved stable mate, ""Liza with a Z."" It gives us a young Liza, star of stage, screen and television, at the top of her form. It was made by many talented hands, and won a Primetime Emmy, so its obscurity is surely not deserved.

For starters, it was written for the stage and directed by Fred Ebb, of the greatly talented pair of songwriters from whom Minelli has gotten some of her most famous material ---try ""Cabaret,"" or even ""Chicago."" It was choreographed by Susan Stroman, who has gone from triumph to triumph on Broadway recently - try ""The Producers."" (And Stroman actually directed the recent movie version of that hit play.)  ""Live"" was produced by multi-talented Phil Ramone, directed by reliable tv hand Louis J. Horvitz.  Jazzman Billy Stritch gets credit for musical supervision.  Clothing was by esteemed designer Isaac Mizrahi; Liza's makeup was by deservedly popular Kevyn Aucoin.  And then, of course, we get Minelli herself, backed by a good-sized orchestra that occasionally sings too, and her ""Demon Divas,"" a group of women that's unusually inclusive by age and size, who sing and dance like, well, demons.

Then there's the star of course, one of the belters in the great tradition of her mother, beloved star of stage and screen, Judy Garland.  Each can pack a song full of emotion while belting it out, but can still deliver a quiet one; can act out a song as few others, and can change pace on the spot.  In addition, as a younger woman, Minelli's generally got more energy than her mother. The young star had not yet begun to have voice or hip troubles; she can work up a sweat dancing, and still deliver the goods vocally.

For the first act, Minelli joins us in Mizrahi's famous white trenchcoat. That act is on the quieter side, with memorable solo versions of ""Teach Me Tonight,"" ""Old Friends,"" and a cynical number Lotte Lenya introduced in 1929 Berlin, cabaret time, ""So What."" It concludes with a work by the French singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour, in that language, for a lovely emotional-laden tribute to Minelli's father.  He, Vincente Minelli, went from art director at Radio City, as a young man during the 1930's, to a famous director of movie musicals.

The singer speeds up the second act.  She's joined on stage by the Demon Divas; don't ask me why, but the way they were salted away in the audience, and stood up to demand to join her onstage just made me uneasy.  But they sure do a job of work.  During several medleys, the star and her divas give us fresh versions of favorite ""Cabaret"" tunes, a new take on her mother's ""The Man I Love,"" a sexy, high-energy, white-gloved tribute to her close associate Bob Fosse, and a high-stepping, ever-so-appropriate to the venue, Rockette style tap dance.  And soaked in sweat, lubricious in a bright red dress, she gives us an electrifying version of her signature, ""New York, New York,"" backed by those divas, in black Mizrahi trenchcoats this time.  The number of people who love Liza is no puzzle.  What is? The relative obscurity of this selection.",1200355200,12,3186,4.774134790528233
