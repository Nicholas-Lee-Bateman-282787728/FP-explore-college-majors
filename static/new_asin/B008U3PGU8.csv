8530463,5,B008U3PGU8,"One of the finest films ever made in French cinema, this classic stars Lino Ventura (one of France's finest actors, known for such classics as 'Army of Shadows' which was rated as the best film of 2006 when it was re-released, and the film noir 'Classe Tous Risques'), and Hardy Kruger (famous for his incredible performance in the classic film 'Flight of the Phoenix' with James Stewart and for the war film that launched his career, 'The One That Got Away').

Without giving too much of the plot away, Hardy Kruger plays a German officer captured by French troops in North Africa during WWII.  He speaks French perfectly and eventually his captors come to rely upon him for their survival.  I should note that the film's message is pro-Jewish and NOT pro-Nazi at all.  The German officer does not ever even appear to be a Nazi.  There is actually quite a bit of drama, humor and suspense throughout, and this is a movie that even people who generally don't like war films will enjoy.

While there are absolutely no adult, inappropriate or offensive scenes (this film contains NO nudity, sex scenes, bathing scenes, pornographic posters, drugs, gore or the like), this is a war movie with a pretty strong ending so it would not be recommended for very young children, but if one suddenly ran into the room you wouldn't have to worry that there was anything pornographic or violently graphic that they accidentally seen.  You really have to watch the movie in its entirety to be affected by it.  There are no cheesy special effects, every second of the movie is entirely believable and realistic.

The transfer is very crisp and clean.  This DVD presents the film with it's original audio track which is in the French language, but Olive Films was kind to provide easy-to-read English subtitles, and please don't let that deter you from watching it, the script is so well-written that reading the subtitles is well worth the effort.

A true masterpiece, with an intelligent, witty and captivating screenplay, impeccable performances by the whole cast and beautiful cinematography - this is a must-see!",1471651200,3,2101,4.857142857142857

8530466,4,B008U3PGU8,"In this case, writing a product review amounts to a movie review, in this case I am glad I've seen the movie but not everybody would enjoy it.  It's a French movie taking place in north Africa during WWII and is about a handful of men with a German prisoner trying to get safely through the German lines.  It's reminiscent of the Bogart movie ""Sahara"" a little bit of ""Wages of Fear"" thrown in-in black and white with subtitles.",1420588800,,428,4.405063291139241
8530467,4,B008U3PGU8,"im sure some won't like this movie because its sort of low budget without much action. but i enjoyed it. i thought it was a good story. its a different sort of war movie. more like escape thru the desert, with all the wrong people.",1405728000,,231,4.155555555555556
8530468,5,B008U3PGU8,"If my memory serves me correctly, this movie appeared shortly after Hardy Kruger's famous movie, ""The One that Got Away"". In this movie, his acting style is much the same as before but I was pleasantly surprised that my interest was held so well by the other supporting cast. The presentation in black and white didn't seem to detract but I was perpetually frustrated by the brief exposure times for the subtitles, which, of course, reflected the speed of the French dialogue.",1367280000,4,476,4.817073170731708
8530469,5,B008U3PGU8,"This was a very daring movie where the ""heroes"" befriend an ""enemy"" and soon must depend on him for their own survival in the desert. Who's a friend and who's the enemy now? The answer gradually dawns on us: these people have no fight with one another. They are only men who need one another. The most daring scene is the very end where the character of Lino Ventura refuses to salute during a parade because of his bitterness (Spoiler alert: when they are rescued by French troops, their German prisoner/friend is killed.)",1345420800,12,523,4.634408602150538
