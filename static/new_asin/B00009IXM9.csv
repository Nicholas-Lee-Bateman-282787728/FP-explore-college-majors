8518304,5,B00009IXM9,This film is very well done.  It does a good job conveying the highlights of the Southern region of Costa Rica without focusing too much on commercialism or large resorts.  A beautiful visual experience.,1265155200,,203,4.9411764705882355
8518305,1,B00009IXM9,This was a commercial for the coast of Southern Costa Rica.  I was led to believe it was a surfing movie and I would see the surfers doing their thing and where they were staying.  It was like sitting through a time share commercial and That is not me.  Think again when you go to view this.  I wish someone had mentioned this in their review and I would not of made the mistake.,1098057600,11,379,4.081081081081081
8518306,5,B00009IXM9,I'm going to be visiting Costa Rica this coming summer and this DVD gave me a glimpse of the entire southern area. I am a very outdoors type person and this DVD tailored to the more active side of Costa Rica. It showed a range of places to stay from expensive to basically a jungle tent. So anyone can use this DVD to plan their trip with exactly what they want to do already in their mind. A great preview! Can't wait!,1070409600,6,419,4.121951219512195
