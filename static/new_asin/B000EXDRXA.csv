8115314,5,B000EXDRXA,"If you are a baseball fan you will love this collection. It's a compelling narrative on 3 of the most famous Yankees ever to don the famous pin striped uniforms (the best uniform in all of sports).

When you see the old Yankee Stadium in the old stock footage you will notice the grave tomb stone monuments in centerfield (in the field of play) where they buried Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Miller Huggins. When Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio died they buried them next to Ruth, Gehrig, and Huggins. You can see thier tomb stones when you visit Monument Park in Yankee Stadium.

There are a lot of ""if's"" in Yankee lore. Being a Yankee fan is hard, very hard...there's been hardship. For example, the Mazerowski home run in 1960, the George Brett home run off of Goose Gossage in the 1980 ALCS. The Gonzalez 9th inning hit in the 7th game of the 2001 World Series...the list goes on.

All I can say is that those Yankee shortcommings broke my heart and scarred my soul.

Our New York Yankees HAVEN'T won a World Championship in OVER 6 years. It will be 7 years after the 2006 World Series:

The St. Louis Cardinals will defeat the Detroit Tigers 4 games to 1 game in the 2006 World Series. The odds in Vegas are 12 to 1 for St. Louis which is very surprising. I'm not a betting man, but if I were I would bet the house on the Cardinals. Do yourself a favor and go to Vegas and win yourself some money. If you bet $1,000, you will get $12,000, if you bet $3,000 you will get $36,000...etc. You will win. Take my word for it.

In the past 30 years I've named the World Series winner 29 times before the start of the playoffs. The only time I came up short was in 1988. I took Oakland that year. My record is great because I know the game of baseball like no other human being who has ever analyzed the game (I called the 2004 Red Sox Championship in June of 2004 and the 2005 White Sox Championship in May of 2005).

Our Yankees don't have the starting and middle relief pitching to compete for the World Championship this year. I wish they did. Furthermore, they have a cancer at 3rd base in a sulking, overrated, prima donna, ""me only"", and vastly tumorous player. Many teams don't have to deal with that major problem and headache. Call him Mr. Dissension.

Being a lifelong Yankee fan is an everlasting bond with the past and present; with a franchise who has had it's ups and downs (mostly good times). When my childhood idol Mickey Mantle passed away, I had the same feelings of sadness, grief, and loss when my father passed.

When Yankee Captain Thurman Munson died in the 1979 plane crash there wasn't a dry eye in my household. To me it was like losing a brother, a sister, an uncle. When Billy Martin died prematurely the world stopped for me.

The New York Yankees are the class of American sports and when personal tradgedy strikes it hits a nerve with all of us who grew up rooting for our beloved team. I don't think any other franchise can conjure up the deep sentiments and emotions a true Yankee fan can.

Someday, hopefully soon, our New York Yankees can return to glory.",1154304000,4,3087,4.360627177700349
