2248169,5,B0007XFZYQ,"A wonderful, funny story by a great cast. Jimmy Stewart was perfection.",1434585600,,71,5.0
2248170,4,B0007XFZYQ,Alternative production of the famous Harvey - gives a different interpretation of the characters than what we're used to in the Jimmy Stewart version. It's certainly recommended not only for enjoyment but especially if you need a different perspective on some of the characters.,1426464000,,278,5.340909090909091
2248171,3,B0007XFZYQ,"for those of you who prefer the jimmy stewart version I cant argue with that after all it is superb. however as a fan of night court it was nice to see  judge harry(Anderson) again and this was a good role for it. I own both copies and found this, thou quite different, to be just as charming in its own way. I am however not a fan of leslie nielson and could have wished both he and the Wilson character( both very annoying ) had been cast differently........mechanicly the dvd was good was shipped on time and arrived in good condition.",1424217600,,538,4.2745098039215685
2248172,5,B0007XFZYQ,"This is a remake of an earlier film staring Jimmie Steward.  Both films are absolute entertainment.  They are a treatments on Humanism in all of it myriad of faucets.  I guess I look at this story line in a very much behavioral aspect.  Man can have so many variations of behavior that sometimes it is very difficult to separate them.  This delightful story gives just such a look into such behaviors.  Please do not miss it, both the 1950 version and the 2005 version.  Both are a wonderful set of entertainments.

2248173,5,B0007XFZYQ,This is a great version of a real classic.,1420675200,,42,3.7777777777777777
2248174,2,B0007XFZYQ,The remake is a good attempt at the original but the minor changes and the casting choice of  Leslie Nielsen was a poor choice ( but I've never cared for him),1408579200,,158,4.096774193548387
2248175,5,B0007XFZYQ,"While the Jimmy Stewart version is the criteria for comparison, Harry does a creditable job, Swoozie Kurtz is a good Veta, and Leslie Nielsen plays it straight arrow and is hilarious as Dr. Chumley - very good and compares well to Jimmy Stewarts rendition.",1388793600,,256,4.840909090909091
2248176,1,B0007XFZYQ,"Harvey is one of my all time favorite movies and this remake should have never happened.  It has none of the richness of the original, and the changes made to it created a choppy story that was unbearable to watch.  I so wanted this to work as I enjoy Harry Anderson but the original Harvey still stands strong--don't touch the classics.",1346025600,6,337,4.508196721311475
2248177,2,B0007XFZYQ,"I'm a fan of the original Harvey with Jimmy Stewart, so I was interested to see the newer version would.  I like Leslie Nielson, so I thought that was promising.

Ultimately, however, this was a huge cinematic waste.  It isn't an awful movie, but the original is SOooo much better, and they didn't really try to change much about the movie.  It's even set in the same time period, and they ""dumbed-down"" the cinematography and sound to make it seem like a movie filmed in the same time period as the original.

I had a bad feeling when I watched the Illustrated intro, and after watching the whole thing, I came away wondering what was the point of doing a remake of a movie that was already good?  It wasn't to modernize it.  It wasn't to improve the storyline, and it certainly wasn't to indroduce more talented acting.  The acting was mediocre and lackluster.

Basically, they just tried to re-create the original version with new (not better) actors.  If you're going to watch a version of Harvey, stick with the original.",1228348800,33,1026,4.6187845303867405
2248178,2,B0007XFZYQ,"I bought this version by mistake. This version has it's moments, but is no comparison to the James Stewart version. Harry Anderson as Dowd had potential at first, but the movie is ruined for the most part by certain actors trying too hard to act, and some too little.",1217116800,21,267,4.469387755102041

8053314,4,B0007XFZYQ,"Actually, not too bad for a remake of one of those classic films considered as 'unre-makeable'. For someone who didn't start out as a trained actor, and never really considered himself one, Anderson does a very nice job of playing Dowd in a performance that has a good bit of subtle poignancy and humor. He won't replace Jimmy Stewart as the ultimate Dowd (and he'd probably have been the first to agree that he wouldn't), but he gets high marks for the job he does with the role here. Biggest drawback to this version is uneven performances from his co-stars, who range from being too bland to rather annoyingly over-the-top (unfortunately, Leslie Nielsen is the worst culprit in the latter department). Even with that drawback, I'd still recommend this version, and if you're one of Harry's fans, it's a bit of a must have. Rest in peace, Harry--I for one am glad this film is available for us to remember you by.",1524873600,,915,4.654320987654321
8053315,4,B0007XFZYQ,"This film demonstrates some of Harry Anderson's subtle range without really adding anything new to the classic story.
The film still follows Mary Chase's award winning script fairly closely. They add a few extra shots and some camera work to pad out the movie to pace correctly on television without adding or taking away.
Besides Harry Anderson, the supporting cast is great, but again ad very little to the remake.
Like the Jimmy Stewart television remake of Harvey, this is a fun watch, but not going to replace the original film.",1506384000,,533,4.868131868131868
8053316,3,B0007XFZYQ,"It was ok. I thought I had ordered the original version, though, so I was disappointed when this updated version arrived.",1505606400,,121,4.809523809523809

8053320,5,B0007XFZYQ,"This movie was wonderful, just as the original. The actors did a great job, and it was nice to see it remade with actors of this day and age. This movie gave me a sense of nostalgia. It's a funny but also a sweet movie with some moments of emotion. I also love the house this movie was filmed in. One of my all time faves!!!",1455408000,,324,3.9242424242424243
