Im pleased with the discs overall. The only thing I didn't get were the laminated photos that came with it. In the pocket that would include maybe a booklet, I got a load of photos I didn't put together and felt really stupid because I am an idiot American and believe me when I was the idiot who tried to match things up. I just felt dumb. Im glad now for the references but I wish I would have done more homework because I DO care and DO research references that I may not get being stateside. The discs were in pristine condition so thank you for that!",1524182400,,702,4.169117647058823
8238344,5,B0010SARGI,Much more then the American releases ...does lack the holiday specials. Still worth it.,1490832000,,87,5.285714285714286
8238345,2,B0010SARGI,"We watched series 1 and didn't think much of it. We love Dawn French in Vicar of Dibley, but we didn't think this was that funny. There are funny parts in it, we are thinking of watching series 6 to see if it gets any better, if not we won't be watching anymore. Was looking forward to watching but very disappointed.",1489017600,,317,4.213114754098361
8238346,5,B0010SARGI,"Simply the best comedy duo ever.  Dawn French is a genius.  Jennifer ain't too shabby either.  This is a great deal, more laughs per buck than probably anything on Amazon.",1468108800,,171,4.633333333333334
8238347,5,B0010SARGI,"French and Saunders are absolutely brilliant! This is worth getting, even if you own the American releases. Hours of unreleased material. Fantastic!",1442188800,2,148,5.7727272727272725
8238348,5,B0010SARGI,"Transaction was smooth, arrived quick always positive experience with this seller. The show is hilarious it's basically SNL done british style. Lots of skits which are hilarious, you really have to be a brit com fan though. If your not into british humor you might not enjoy this as much. I love it and love the chemistry between Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.",1433203200,,364,4.7936507936507935
8238349,5,B0010SARGI,"Excellent and speedy delivery, a whole month ahead of expectations!",1430179200,,67,5.8
8238350,5,B0010SARGI,If you like comedy then you will love French and Saunders (Rench and Stench). The only frustrating thing is that they are not region 1 dvds so you will have to change your computer to the correct region.  Love them though so it was worth it!!!,1358640000,3,243,4.282608695652174
