8171575,4,B000MRTVUG,"I actually really enjoyed this low budget suspense/ thriller / horror flick. I am partial to horror movies that take place in the snow and mountains, and of course 70's or 80's so this film already had me in the first few scenes, but as it developed the story was good, acting not terrible and I like the way it was shot, it kept my interest throughout, for a low budget old school horror it was done well, I found it satisfying and well above most modern horror flicks, that tend to be just gore feasts.",1414540800,,504,4.260416666666667
8171576,3,B000MRTVUG,"On a wintery New Year's Eve two women (Jenny and Chrissy) and one man (Marty) embark on a short snowmobile excursion. When the snowmobile breaks down, they are forced to seek refuge in a deserted hotel. There they confront powerful evil forces. ""Ghostkeeper"" is a pretty creepy and atmospheric horror film which will keep you guessing until the end. The acting is solid and the atmosphere of fear and total isolation is well-captured. The location (snowy mountains and a mansion in the middle of nowhere) provide some chills. Check it out if you are a horror fan.",1391040000,,563,4.814432989690721
