7927796,3,B00004YZF6,"""One Man Army"" is the second of three collaborations between B-movie guru Cirio Santiago (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNT-Jackson/dp/B00016MSU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNT Jackson</a>) and kickboxer-turned-actor Jerry Trimble, as well as a low-budget made-in-the-Philippines derivative of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walking-Tall/dp/B000VDDDWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walking Tall</a>. It sits pretty much in the middle of the work Santiago's done, as well as Trimble's as a solo star, but unless you're a fan of either, it's nothing special. Questionable production methods counter the average-to-good fight scenes, leveling out this one's rating to an unenthusiastic three stars. Newcomers to Santiago's fare might as well start here, but Trimble devotees have the option to acquaint themselves with stronger work before giving this one a shot.

The story: upon the death of his father, tae kwon do instructor Jerry Pelt (Trimble,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master/dp/B000067J48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master</a>) returns to his rural hometown to find it transformed into a hotbed of underground activity, oppression, and blatant corruption. At the urging of his old flame (Melissa Moore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sorority-House-Massacre-2/dp/6305976473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sorority House Massacre 2</a>), he takes it upon himself to clean up the town by running for sheriff, therein putting both his friends and his himself at risk.

Let's get the important stuff out of the way: Jerry's martial arts moves are excellent but the fight scenes themselves are a little weak. I can say with certainty that Trimble is one of the very best kickers in the film world and the fact that he does most of his own stunts does not go unappreciated. However, the coolness of his performances is stifled by having almost all of the fights filmed in shadowy areas with only a single camera that doesn't always capture the best angle of things. Of the nine fights, the best happens about halfway through the movie when our hero takes on two thugs in a pool room, but even this one would garner only a 3.5 rating on its own. Some gunfighting mixes things up a bit, but it's not terribly exciting, either. However, there is the minor bonus of Jerry having a German shepherd as a constant companion, and the dog's always attacking someone. The filmmakers could've done a lot more with this aspect (make it kind of a more violent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/K-9/dp/B00000IQW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">K-9</a>, perhaps), but it's cool enough as it is for me to appreciate it.

The cast is comprised entirely of B-movie performers - including Dennis Hayden (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>), Rick Dean (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnosaur-3-Primal-Species/dp/B00004OCXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnosaur 3: Primal Species</a>), and James Paolleli (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sudden-Thunder/dp/B00004YKMX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sudden Thunder</a>) - and you can expect approximate acting, though it's on the more tolerable side of things and for once Jerry Trimble doesn't look confused all the time. There's a bit of exploitation going on, with no less than three scenes featuring naked breasts and another two featuring women being shot. Aesthetically, the movie isn't boring to look at but I always find myself irritated when these Filipino movies fail so poorly at trying to convince you they're taking place in America - it's quite clear where it was actually filmed. More than a few scenes are shot in dark or shadowy environments, which really doesn't help things especially when the characters are similarly dressed in black. The story offers next to no surprises beyond a late one concerning the allegiance of the Dennis Hayden character, so there's hardly any need to watch the non-action portions of the movie.

It's clear that the performers had fun making this movie, and the carefree feeling sorta-kinda rubs off if you're a game viewer, but the movie's just not strong enough to qualify for repeat viewings for most folks. Again, fans of the bigger names involved in this one might want to check it out, but everyone else ought to consider this throwaway material. If you catch it on TV sometime, give it a peek, but don't feel obligated to spend money on it.",1324944000,3,4709,6.296124031007752
7927797,1,B00004YZF6,Don't even bother with this film.  another attempt to bring a kung fu style fighting together with non impressive non talented actors and martial artists.  leave this one on the rack.,995760000,3,183,4.870967741935484
7927798,4,B00004YZF6,"Action packed from the beginning.  A young fighters family is killed by a ruthless lord.  The young man sets off on a mission to avenge his hardship.  With the company of his young nephew he travels through many towns in search for the one responsible.  Without knowing the evil lord puts a 1000 gold tail bounty on his head, and master fighters come from far and wide to collect. Non stop action, and great fast paced fight scenes, perfect set of characters, both good and bad guy's.  I reccomend this for sure to any old school martial arts fan.  Find out if he can get his revenge or die trying.",984268800,,598,4.390909090909091
7927799,2,B00004YZF6,"this movie has a couple of mediocre fight scenes but sadly most of this movie has to do with (I am not makeing this up) the charicters political life as running for office. the fight scences have little to do with teh  plot, not that there are very many. now there are a lot of B movies worse  that cost a lot more but this just doesn't offer much. I reccomend Daneil  bernhardt gary daniels and billy blanks. their movies usually have more  action and quality",960595200,2,460,4.313953488372093
