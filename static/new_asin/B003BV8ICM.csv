4107426,5,B003BV8ICM,"Although I do not own this particular DVD, I do own each of these movies individually. Each one is very entertaining.
Twister - chasing tornadoes across the central USA. Not realistic but still entertaining.
The Perfect Storm - the last voyage of the Andrea Gale fishing vessel lost at sea during the ""east coast storm of the century"".
Outbreak- Dustin Hoffman tries to stop the spread of an Ebola-like hemoragic disease.
Poseidon- OK remake of the sinking of a cruise ship.
Overall, I would definitely recommend these movies (especially in a set). Very entertaining and worth the price.",1339113600,3,587,5.0

I really enjoyed the newer version of Poseidon but hated the way Kurt Russell died. I have always

4107442,3,B003BV8ICM,"Four films for a reasonable price is always a fair deal.  However, the quality of these movies are minimal [standard].  Also, be aware that the movie, Poseidon, is NOT the original 1972 version titled, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE featuring an ensemble cast including Gene Hackman, Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, and others in starring roles.  You will have to purchase the very popular award-winning 1972 movie on another DVD.

Among the four films featured in this DVD, OUTBREAK and TWISTER are probably the best.  Again, the cost is reasonable if you enjoy disaster/survival films. *Don't waste your time on the 2006 version of Poseidon. *Wish I had paid closer attention to the title prior purchasing.
