7950605,5,B00005QJJ0,"This falls into the category of ""DVDs I watch again and again."" It has approx 70% jetskiing and the rest a good mix of equally rewindable motor-x footage and wakeboarding - basically the rules for putting something on this must have been simply ""Was it crazy enough!?"" There are a few unbelievabably big air shots on Jetskis and plenty of stunts (even a ""superman"" pulled - I thought that would have been near impossible on a jetski!) plus lots of definetley crazzzzy stuff, including jetskiing in a resort swimming pool, the odd bikini clad girl (but nothing thats lweed or unsuitable for family viweing) , power boat juming through fire, the police having to come and get the guys off these tiny mini bikes - the cop ends up laughing too, some off roading in a golf cart, some very bad (good!) crashes on bikes, jetskis ect. Be prepared for some interludes which after you watch once aren't too amusing, but I'd rather have them there than not. The pumped music also makes me want to watch it repeatedly. I own over 10 extreme DVDs and this is definetley a must-buy along with Ski Movie 2. On the cover it says the film is 45 mins, but it never seemed too short, even more crazy stuff is shown when the credits roll, and then there are extras such as AMCF1 and interviews with the makers and bonus footage too. So it's good value, good production of the dvd and the actual movie.",1059782400,,1381,4.484126984126984
