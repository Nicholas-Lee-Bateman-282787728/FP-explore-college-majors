2034459,5,B0001WTVJ8,Jaclyn Smith and Tim Matheson should make more movies together as they have great chemistry on screen. The story was excellent and the location could not have been better. What a great place to live to appreciate the beautiful splendors of God's work. It's a must have for those of you who love made for television movies.,1256428800,,322,4.666666666666667
2034460,5,B0001WTVJ8,"Really enjoyed this as we all can do with reminding that all of our actions have consequences even if not seen, just an enjoyable watch",1251590400,,135,4.44
2034461,5,B0001WTVJ8,Who would have thought that two people who have opposite personalities from the beginning would have ended up married in the end? What made watching this movie delightful for me is that it was based on a true story and that I have lived on an island in Puget Sound and have visited the area where the movie takes place watching the A-Pod killer whales migrate down from Alaska.,1246320000,2,377,4.478260869565218
2034462,4,B0001WTVJ8,"I ordered this movie because I have always liked Jaclyn Smith. I was expecting a simple ""chick-flick"". Was I surprised! It was really a very good movie. Even my husband who was passing through the room a couple of times ended up just staying put and finished watching it with me...which I thought was wonderful! He and I both enjoyed it very much.",1191801600,5,347,4.523809523809524
2034463,5,B0001WTVJ8,"If you are a fan of romance and romantic movies, this is a keeper.  If you are a fan of Tim Matheson (major fan here) and Jaclyn Smith this is the movie for you.  Basically it is the girl meets boy/boy meets girl and they don't get along.  He can't stand her and thinks she is just some city reporter who has no clue of what life is like in a remote area.  She thinks he is arrogant, conceited etc...  Of course, one of the village women plays cupid and matchmaker and to see how it all comes together you have to watch the movie.  It is a wonderful romance movie with a beautiful ending.  There is much more in the middle, but I don't want to ruin it or give it all away.  Watch it, you won't regret it.

2034464,4,B0001WTVJ8,"It's a pity that movies like these are not getting better treatment by the distributors. Case in fact, are the problems encountered by those people who first bought this dvd. But surprise, surprise!, same thing happened here in Australia when the movie was first shown on FOXTel cable last year.

The distributors or whoever did the ad/guide layout didn't even bother to mention the names of the two lead stars, namely Jaclyn Smith and Tim Matheson. Instead, they used the names of those two unknown supporting actors (!?). If you don't know anything about the film, you'll definetely missed it.

Anyway, I really like this film. It's so romantic, and so sweet and the performance are absolutely fabulous. Smith and Matheson are so beautiful together. They should actually make more romantic movies. The film is so affectionate plus the scenery --the beautiful outback of Canada and the fish (!) of course!

I'm just wondering why they changed the original title FISHING WITH JOHN? That suits better, I guess.

And my golly, Jaclyn Smith, did she really found the fountain of youth? She's absolutely gorgeous and so sexy....",1112486400,28,1124,4.994652406417113

It's a movie that has heart, it's authentic and the screen writer chose incredible words to express the theme of the movie. The setting is beautiful and serene.

2034506,4,B0001WTVJ8,"While not the best movie I have ever seen, this was certainly engaging and not what I expected.

Based on the true story of New York journalist Edith Iglauer (1917-), it tells of her trip to British Columbia to determine why fish costs so much, at the insistence of her magazine's new editor, only to discover that if Ottawa bureaucrats got their way, there would soon be no fish at all. They proposed a dam across a critical salmon spawning ground.

By this time, probably in the early or mid 1980s she was presumably no longer at The Yorker, which she had joined as a staff writer in 1961. It seems highly unlikely that the New Yorker's editor in the 1980s could have been as stupid as the one portrayed in the film. (Which is to say nothing of the seriously diminished quality of that magazine these days.)

The stream had already been severely damaged by a rock fall caused by blasting from nearby logging operations, and while it was cleared the stream's recovery did not come without a cost of human life. Nor did the spawning ground ever fully recover to its original glory.

In any case. Iglauer's reporting changed the course of thinking in Ottawa, and the dam did not go forward.

It's a fascinating story of journalism, and love, fairly well acted, with some snappy dialogue, but also too many tits for tats and cliches.",1517788800,3,1331,4.57563025210084
2034507,5,B0001WTVJ8,Love this movie. A great love story!,1517702400,,36,4.285714285714286
2034508,4,B0001WTVJ8,"Movies from the 80's can have the same canned responses, musical score and even acting styles. This one carries that load but it has so much more to offer. It is a product of its time, but the acting (from the main characters plus Mary) is believable and accurate to the time and place in which the story is offered. There is wisdom here. The beauty of this film is in those offerings as well as the experience of watching the main characters change slowly, through assessment, admitting up to their own ignorance and finding organic emotions that aren't easily quieted or explained. If you can stand the 80's vibe, carry on. There is something here worth experiencing.",1517616000,,669,4.677966101694915
2034509,5,B0001WTVJ8,"From her ""Charlie's Angels"" era, I have been a fan of Jaclyn Smith and she came through with her talent, beauty and grace in this movie.  It is a love story of how a NYC reporter meets and falls head-over-heels with a handsome Canadian a salmon fisherman. There was some action scenes when the fishing boat was in the storm. She writes the newspaper article,""Fish Wars"". which helped to prevent a dam being installed.  This would ruin the fishing industry in this little village, both the fish and the fishermen. The filmography was just amazing with the fishing boat in the storm, their walk through the woods to the rushing stream, and even the sky view of NYC in the opening of the movie.  The music was very good too.  I loved it.",1517270400,2,734,4.496240601503759
2034510,5,B0001WTVJ8,"I liked this movie very much. The main two actors are always very watchable in anything they do. The story was more interesting than the average TV romance drama. It was really well filmed on location. Even though it's an older film, it has a message that is certainly relevant today. The streaming quality of the picture was very good.",1517184000,2,336,4.616666666666666
2034511,3,B0001WTVJ8,"I love Jaclyn Smith and I wanted to love this movie, however, the ending was so predictable.
Here are spoilers:
*****
There were some continuity errors such as a character saying three weeks instead of three days. And a globe-trotting reporter doesn't have anything but high heels and no winter coat with her to go do a story about the price of salmon in Canada? She lives in NY City, so it's not as if she doesn't own a puffy coat or two. And the publisher of the magazine was an idiot--he never would have lasted more than one issue. You can't run a regional magazine like that. Also, it's not my favorite plot bunny when the main characters are at odds with each other and very rude to each other and a natural disaster brings them together.

Having said all that, I loved watching Jaclyn Smith and Tim Matheson make lemonade out of the script they were given. Both have good acting chops and their romantic chemistry seemed natural. The music scoring and photography were really good. Supporting cast was good, too.

I did enjoy the movie, even though it was ""based on a true story,"" which always ends up being a little cliched because, yeah, real life is like that.

I'm going to give it three stars for watch-a-bility. Smith and Matheson are good together and I would like to see them make another movie. I also found the politics of the salmon fisherman to be intriguing. Who knew there was so much to it besides actual fishing process?",1517097600,,1443,4.521072796934866

2034664,3,B0001WTVJ8,"received product as advertised, very quickly. I have a DVD which plays any regionmost US DVD s only play region one. The movie was with Jaclyn Smith, Tim Matheson and based on a true story. Those are the positives. Though its based on a true story, there are times that believability is stretched. Smith plays the number one reporter for a magazine which is undergoing major changes. The script establishes the reporter so well, that one wonders why she hangs around for changes shes clearly not on board with. But she does and ends up out in the middle of nowhere interviewing a hostile salmon fisherman played by Matheson. Surviving a severe storm aboard his boat has them both rethinking themselves and each other. Though the boat was virtually sinking at one point, repairs must have been incredibly quickly. The last part of the script is probably the weakest. I'd write SPOILERS here, except there really isn't much to spoil. Off-camera the reporter apparently wrote enough articles and caused enough of a stir to help defeat Canadian legislation.",1433808000,,1053,4.921348314606742

2034685,3,B0001WTVJ8,"I've never written a review on a movie before, and I'm generally entertained easily. But this movie was so disappointing, I decided to post my opinion. I did purchase the movie before ever having watched it before (which I admit is my own fault) but I did so because I liked the plot, the setting, and the two actors (Jaclyn Smith and Tim Matheson). Also, it had gotten some good reviews here. However, this ""romance"" employs one of the most overused and boring tactics, which is to bring two people together in an unusual situation, make them hate each other on sight for no good reason, keep them bickering for no good reason throughout the story, and then they miraculously change their personalities and opinions of each other all of a sudden, jump into bed together, and fall madly in love. They did almost die together in a storm, which seemed to bring them closer together, but these two characters were so rude to each other prior to that incident that I didn't care whether they got together in the end or not.",1357689600,2,1019,4.573770491803279

2034687,3,B0001WTVJ8,"I researched this movie and could not find a rating or any parental guidance. It should be rated PG13. There is a storm scene on the boat where it looks like they might drown. The guy is in his underwear and is under a blanket with the girl with his legs around her.  Also, the movie has a sex scene in it later on. Profanity consists of ""hell"" and ""damn."" I thought parents with young kids might want to know, because it starts out as if it would be OK, since it is about environmental concerns and fishing.",1289088000,2,508,4.183673469387755
