Prepare yourself for a rip-roaring rollercoaster ride that keeps you hanging on for the ride.  There is more gore in this movie than most slashers, a great sociopathic killer.  What a loveable cast of characters, how could you not love a movie that includes Jerry Lawler, Beetlejuice, Sal the Stockbroker, Ron Jeremy and Janessa Brazil (I think I'm in love with her).  It goes without saying the girls are beautiful and adorable.  Too bad for them they rented the wrong house.  There are a lot of quotable lines and unforgettable scenes.

It's a Jason/Freddie chop 'em up flick only the girls are topless. Given how skinny they are, that doesn't really matter too much, though.

5114026,3,B007XF0XUW,"Without the abundant extras, which include all kinds of behind-the-scenes, interviews, a commentary and a bunch of other stuff, this is no question a two-star review.

The script isn't bad but the acting is terrible, and the dialogue atrocious. Whenever Jerry Lawler gets first billing, you know that you're in for a bad movie--especially since Lawler IS actually the best actor in this cast. It sort of drives me nuts that they cast all of the actresses because they look hot (and they ARE hot--and there are lots and lots of them) yet they barely get naked and certainly don't live up to the promise of the ""unrated"" slapped across the cover.

There is a little nudity, but only one scene of full-frontal (right at the beginning and featuring an actress who isn't depicted anywhere else in the film) and the girls who do expose are disappointingly flat-chested. There is one notable exception, but she's got unrealistic implants. There are some amazing-looking extras but hardly any of them disrobe.

With all of the eye candy this movie could have been great. Instead it focuses way more on gore than it does on the effective use of the nude female form. I'm sure that plenty of people out there prefer that, but there likely are many more like me who'd have traded all of the minutes of spurting stage blood for gratuitous shower scenes. After all, there is far more exposed flesh on that cover than there is mangled body parts for a reason.

What's the plot? As if you care, one  of the six hot girls who are taking a spring-break trip together is chaste, and the others are raving sluts. She lives in an oppressively-conservative Catholic household with a domineering mother. After  their trip starts, a masked assailant shows up and begins brutally murdering them.

""Girls Gone Dead"" is presented tongue-in-cheek but many of the supposedly-funny parts aren't funny, and the dialogue is so terrible that you'll want to fast-forward just to get through it. Unfortunately there isn't anything good to fast-forward to. So do yourself a favor and pass on this. It's obvious that those behind the production tried really hard and it's a shame that the movie didn't turn out better.",1396137600,,2182,4.818181818181818

5114028,5,B007XF0XUW,"This DVD has a whole lot of sexiness going on!

This is one of the best sexy/fun/slasher movies to come out in the last five years, or so.  I'm a huge horror/slasher fan, and this movie, which I first saw on Netflix, made me sit up and pay attention.  It has the perfect combination of sex/horror/humor to be perfect for viewing with your friends.  Sadly, the movie was not available on Netflix, forever, so I bought my very own copy to add to my library of more than 3500 DVD titles.

The Unrated and Exposed Edition is even better!  I've already screened it with friends and everyone, even the women, loved it.  Order a copy, it's better than what you will see on streaming as it has more of everything.  Plus fun commentary.

5114036,2,B007XF0XUW,"Girls Gone Dead (Michael Hoffman and Aaron T. Wells, 2012)

I will give you this right up front: given the title Girls Gone Dead, if you go into this movie expecting something that looks like it came out of Yasujiro Ozu's camera, let's face it, you're dumber than this movie. I try to take things on their own merits, but even when you go into a movie expecting pulp cheesiness, there is good pulp cheesiness and bad pulp cheesiness. Interesting recent examples of the former? Strippers vs. Werewolves (and let's be honest, that's an even worse title than Girls Gone Dead), Gutterballs, and Zombies of Mass Destruction have all come out within the past five years, are all stupidly funny, and when you've finished with them, you may find yourself needing to take a shower, but you won't feel like you've wasted your time. Here, on the other hand... well, given how much I pay for Netflix and how many movies I watch per month, Girls Gone Dead probably cost me in the vicinity of seventeen cents to watch. I'm not going to demand my money back on this one (like I would on, say, Hellraiser: Revelations or Fading of the Cries), but it's a pretty close call.

Plot: the usual batch of young-and-beautifuls (a cheerleading team!) are on spring break at Rebecca (Step Up: Revolution's Katie Peterson)'s father's summer house. Which, it turns out, is a pretty fur piece from the actual beach, but the kids are not going to let that stop them from attempting to have fun partying it up at the local bar, which is terrifying and provides the movie's only true laughs. They also discover that Crazy Girls Unlimited, who are responsible for a very lucrative series of videos featuring topless drunk Spring Break babes (sound familiar?), are filming in close-by Daytona Beach...or were, until a crazed killer broke the party up in a very nasty way. The killer, his thirst for blood whetted, and the co-eds are on the inevitable collision course...

People have been trying to do slasher comedies as long as there have been slasher movies; Student Bodies popped up all the way back in 1981 (and it may still be the best of the lot). Almost all of them are unforgivably bad. And so, looked at in that light, maybe Girls Gone Dead isn't as bottom-of-the-barrel as I originally painted it. If you're familiar with enough movies of this stripe to be able to evaluate this one in the context it so desperately needs, you'll be able to see some of the movie for being as fun as it is. But is it really worth the trouble, given that you probably figured out who the killer is about five minutes after the character was introduced and there's nothing even remotely unpredictable about this flick? Probably not, but if you have absolutely nothing else to do on a Friday night... **",1374364800,3,2761,4.642126789366054
5114037,3,B007XF0XUW,"I have to admit I have a guilty pleasure for silly B movies and for the most part this one did deliver. My biggest problem with this movie was the last ten minutes.  I sort of felt like the director abandoned the set and said just finish it however you want to the actors. I felt like that happened in a few of the scenes actually, but it didn't seem to hurt the movie as much as it did in the end sequence. I caught it on cable so I don't feel as cheated as if I paid to see it. I do have to admit I would have never even watched it if I didn't see Linnea Quigley was in the credits.

5114048,3,B007XF0XUW,"This is a bad movie and I mean that in a good way. At no point was this film supposed to be taken seriously or be seen as something other than a schlocky C grade slasher film. It pokes fun at the genre, but is somewhat unique in that it doesn't try to be an obvious parody of the idea of the slasher film. It'd be easy to dismiss this as ""it sucks, it's not even scary"", but then it's really not supposed to be scary and it doesn't try to be laugh out loud funny like Scary Movie. I'd liken it more to Club Dread, although I'd say that on some levels this succeeded more than Club Dread did.

Part of what makes this film entertaining is that it's so blatant in its approach. It knows that the average person is going to see the title and the cover, assume that they'd see naked women, and then watch for the jiggle factor and maybe to see how much blood is thrown everywhere. This movie plays up to that idea and ever so subtly plays on the common aspects of cheaply made horror films. You have the bad acting, the thin characters, the stereotypical ""good girl"" that survives everything, continuity errors, as well as the inevitable celebrity cameo that never quite fits into the film. Rather than try to avoid them, this film embraces them and is that much more entertaining for it. I think I had to have giggled whenever a rather bored looking Ron Jeremy came onscreen and sort of just stood around with this mixture of depression and ennui, the opposite of how he's usually portrayed in most of his non-adult film performances. I think that actually had to be my favorite part of the film, as it played so well on the celebrity cameos that show up in horror films, where you see actors who are so awkwardly placed into the film and look so bored that they don't really contribute much to the film.

That isn't to say that this movie is particularly good, mind you. While Girls Gone Dead does play up the bad aspects of horror films in a semi-serious light, these aspects are still a problem and occasionally it sags a little under its own weight and makes the movie feel much longer than its 105 minute length. At times I kind of felt like it could have been slightly trimmed down and been a little stronger for it.

Overall though, this was fun. A few friends and I watched it on Netflix, not really expecting to make it through the movie as a whole, and were surprised to find that we enjoyed it so much that we watched it all the way through. I'd actually go so far as to say that I'd probably watch it again. I probably wouldn't buy it, but if I came across it on TV or it came up in my recommendations on Netflix again, I'd give it a watch. It's a beer and pizza film, the type you pull out to watch while your friends are over and you don't want to watch something serious. As long as you go into this knowing that this isn't going to be very good, you're golden.",1363132800,,2873,4.239051094890511

It also gets a bonus star for being actually scary. Not the story, or the tone or even the freaky killer. The scariest part of this movie was Beetlejuice. Seriously. That guy gives me the creeps. Worth a rental and the picture quality (streaming) was excellent.",1354492800,,544,4.3861386138613865

5114053,4,B007XF0XUW,"Remember when horror movies were fun? Back in the 1980's, all you needed was a masked killer, some somewhat attractive teens (saying ""hot"" may be a bit of an overstatement), and a couple of buckets of blood. Mix these ingredients in the cinematic slasher blender and out came a slasher flick worthy to show your friends. Today's horror world is a different place. In the world of found footage horror, cheap just is never cheap enough. Why pay for a couple of gallons of blood when a door can slam shut several times for a ""scary"" effect? Yawn. This is not the horror that I grew up with and it is certainly not the horror that I am proud of today. Am I the only one who misses the classic era of slashers in which the filmmakers just wanted the audience to have a good time? Clearly, judging by tonight's film, I am not. From directors Michael Hoffman Jr and Aaron T. Wells comes the delightfully entertaining ""Girls Gone Dead."" If ever there was a cinematic valentine to the 80's slasher, it is this film.

""Girls Gone Dead"" starts off a little rough as we meet our main girl (A.K.A. the ""pure"" one) Rebecca (Katie Peterson who reminds me of a prettier and more talented Tara Reid) having a nightmare involving a sacrifice in a church. The girl who is to be sacrificed is not pure and must be killed to rid the world of evil. Thankfully, Rebecca wakes up from this nightmare to be confronted by her mother who is terrified that her weekend vacation with ""the girls"" will turn into an orgy of sin (shades of ""Carrie"" & ""Slumber Party Massacre II"" here). Of course her mother is right and Rebecca and the girls plan to drink as much as possible, get naked, and find some guys. What Rebecca and pals don't know is someone has come along for the ride slashing each and every one of the girls, and the guys they meet along the way, until all the ""evil"" has been cleansed from the world.

This is the kind of film that many will either love or hate. The acting is a bit all over the map with many of the girls hired more for their ability to take over their tops than deliver their lines. The film is far too long at 102 minutes and it takes to take its sweet time getting to its final reveal. Also, speaking of final reveals, this has to be one of the most predictable whodunit slashers that I have seen in recent memory. If you don't figure out the killer from the second this character walks on screen, you haven't seen enough horror movies.

So, what works about this film? Everything else! We get some ooey gooey slasher deaths with more blood on screen than all of the Saw sequels combined. This killer is brutal. We are talking multiple decapitations, a cut off breast, multiple amputations, and that's just in the first half of the movie! Thankfully most of the effects are practical so there is no obvious CGI to put a wet blanket on the gore. Though the CGI does rear its ugly head in the final death scene and the result is...not terrible, I guess.

Need more reasons to watch this slasher? How about cameos that include Jerry ""The King"" Lawler as a sheriff,  Beetlejuice & Stockbroker Sal from ""The Howard Stern Show"", Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain, porn legend Ron Jeremy, and, in my favorite cameo, the ""Queen of the B's"" Linnea Quigley as bartender Wild Willie. A blast from beginning to end, this is the kind of movie that just puts a smile on my face. Whether you rent it from the breasts, the blood, or maybe a combo of the two, you are sure to have a great time with ""Girls Gone Dead.""

There is also a slasher who wears a mask, that isn't too hard to figure out due to the limited number of candidates and cliche writing.

The style mimics the 80's slasher with ample nudity and Troma style effects. If fact it goes too far overboard in that it is more of a ""Girls Gone Wild"" film with a slasher. The dialogue and interactions of the characters was weakly written, which is hard to do for this type of film. Plenty of nudity and scream queen Linnea Quigley is always a treat. If you are looking for a slightly amusing slasher with plenty of nudity, this one will fill in until something better comes along. Personally I preferred, Sid Haig's ""Creature,"" to each his own.

Ryan Keely who does lesbian scenes in adult movies, coerces ample Mandy to remove her top in front of her, yet in another scene rejects the advances of Caley Hayes.

Perv guide: F-bomb, crude sexual talk, sex, nudity (Brandy Whitford, Krystyna Ahlers, Shea Stewart, Ryan Keely, Kelly Otis, Caley Hayes, Janessa Brazil, uncredited stripper, uncredited slide girl) and full frontal nudity (Jennifer Worthington).",1347926400,7,1319,4.879464285714286
5114062,3,B007XF0XUW,"I enjoyed watching it enough to rate it three stars, and I made it all the way through in one sitting.  I'll probably never watch it again, and I wish I hadn't bought it.

It's a campy gore movie with a variety of tits and a strong Christian undercurrent.  The standard formula is followed: People who aren't virgins all die.  The surviving girl comes from an over the top religious mom.  Ron Jeremy plays a rather pointless role in the movie.

There are a handful of funny lines and things that happen.",1347667200,,503,4.413043478260869
5114063,2,B007XF0XUW,"Don't believe the hype about this movie.  They wasted the talents of Jerry Lawler and others.  There is plenty of T&A in this movie but the nudity just don't cut it.  None of the gals are really that hot not that I wanted all of them to be but it is like they almost wanted to turn you off with the nudity.  I have to give the movie credit as it was well lit and the sound was perfect but unfortunately the dialogue got boring and annoying.  The humor was out of sync.  I mean if you want to watch a really bad movie with nudity thrown in and gore go for it but I laughed all the way through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Piranha-DD/dp/B004LWZW6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Piranha DD</a>&nbsp;compared to having fast forward parts of this trash.

You know what they say ""One mans trash is another man's treasure."" I opened this piece of plastic coal and discovered a diamond.
Great T & A with a decent script, fresh diaolouge and some tremendous killings via the Warhammer. This rating will inevitably come down once its watched by the wrong crowd but its Amazing satiric Horror schlock with a great independant soundtrack and Beetlejuice wearing the Tit-T Cam helmet. GGD is an instant Cult Classic.
Enjoy this cast of fun twentysomethings as they provide zany party performances. Rodney aka The D.C. Hammer steals the show and if you had to pay $100 for this DVD it would be a steal. I would have died and gone to movie heaven if I could have had the pleasure of seeing GGD on the big screen.
Hammersmashin and Girls Gone Dead will be pounded into my cranium for a long time. And I love it. Hammersmash!

Beetlejuice and Sal from Howard Stern's wack pack are barely in it.  And speaking of ""bare"", this film is post pubescent boob a mania.  Plenty of gratuitous nudity, young girls who can't read a line (it's clear how they probably got these jobs) and some really bad acting.

Bad attempts at gore don't help either,  Jerry The King Lawlor is the best actor in this film.  Need I say more?

Oh, did I mention lots of boobs?

5114070,5,B007XF0XUW,"Although some of the acting is pretty bad it is for the most part pretty decent. The movie features many cameos (but I only recognized Ron Jeremy and Linnea Quigley). It's quickly paced, never gets boring or dull. It's professionally shot and edited. It isn't scary, there is no real suspense but it's very entertaining.  There are a lot of unlikeable characters in this and most of the male characters are douche bags. The masked maniac, brandishing a battle axe, is pretty cool. It's gory, it's not a gorefeast but it was certainly much gorier and violent than I expected. The gore is old school practical make-up fx and most of it looks good. There is gratuitous T & A, including full frontal nudity, and a lot of attractive girls and I do mean a lot.
I enjoyed this a lot, it's pretty much what I expected. Never a dull moment and plenty of T & A, plenty of gore and some comedy. Grab a beer and enjoy it with friends!

5114071,4,B007XF0XUW,"As low budget T & A slasher flicks go, this one is very entertaining. Lots of fun cameos (Beetlejuice & Sal the Stockbroker from the Howard Stern Show, Jerry Lawler, Ron Jeremy, etc) and some amazing production value considering the budget constraints.

The story involves some girls on Spring Break being stalked by a mask wearing murderer who is having a field day chopping everyone up with a medieval war hammer. Hardly worth going into anymore than that - if you're watching this for a compelling story and Oscar worthy performances, you are obviously at the wrong movie. This is about boobs, blood, dopey-raunchy-funny comedy, some more boobs, and that's about it.

Hats off to the filmmakers for some excellent cinematography and old school gore FX.

Everyone involved in this film did an amazing job adding in all the elements to make a campy, T&A comedic thriller, and it pays off.
The films quality picture wise, and all the colors are done very nicely, and it's noticeable they put hard work into pulling this movie off.

What it lacks is originality and characters to care about. There's a ton of characters in this thing, but most of them were douchebags. Oh, well. At least we get to see them get hammered. Also, in the funniest scene of the movie we get to see Linnea Quigley sing some awful country song.

5114082,5,B007XF0XUW,"I was fortunate to see the premiere of ""Girls Gone Dead"" in a theater in Florida earlier this year. It brought this 46-year-old back to his early teens when every week I went to a theater to see another gory horror movie with lots of topless girls being stalked by some maniacal killer (ahh, the joys of youth). Back then the production values were low, but the blood and boobs were always great. I'm happy to report that the blood and boobs in ""Girls Gone Dead"" are just as good as they were in those ""classics,"" but the production values are so much better here. You'd never know this was a low-budget movie.

Even if you aren't familiar with some of the stars (pro wrestling legend Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, Howard Stern regulars Sal The Stockbroker and Beetlejuice, porn legend Ron Jeremy, 80s scream queen Linnea Quigley, etc), this is a movie that any fan of this genre will love.
