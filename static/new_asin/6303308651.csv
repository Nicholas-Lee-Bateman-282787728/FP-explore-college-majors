Plenty of excellent fight scenes with many different characters.
Monkey style, drunken monkey style, eagle style,
snake style, tiger style, crane style, and probably dragon
(can't remember)... all represented with hilarious characters.
Nicely filmed with classic kung fu theatre sound effects.",1013385600,,352,5.537037037037037

624407,3,6303308651,"A fantastic revenge fight flick, great cheesy kung fu cinema.

Unfortunately, they lost 95% of the final fight scene. One moment they are fighting, the next they are bloody and tattered, and the death blow is being delivered. Great set-up, huge let down ending.

Worth the 3.98 version.",1188000000,2,286,4.9375
624408,4,6303308651,If you love good Kung Fu movies then this is the one. It is about the Monkey Style Kung Fu. Just no nonsense and any martial arts fan should own this movie.,1142640000,,156,3.90625
624409,3,6303308651,"it's easily a one-star movie, by most accounts. but unless you're a big-time afficianado of older kung fu films, you shouldn't be watching this to begin with. i'm a fanatic for chop-socky and the kung fu lover in me wants to give this thing five stars. simply because it does all the things i like to see in those movies from back in the day. the ridiculous dubbing and translations. the impossible wind whipping behind every attacking arm or leg. the lousy camera work. the simplest storylines possible. true fans watch stuff like this because it's campy. all you really want is a story about a loser who learns kung fu from an old master so he can get revenge on the bad guy that took over his town or killed his brother. it's that easy. mix up that silliness with some amazing, stylized fighting techniques and you have the perfect candidate for success. perfect for quentin tarrantino to steal and make millions off it.

it's lousy and it's excellent all at the same time.",1100995200,10,976,4.577142857142857
624410,1,6303308651,"This movie will be of interest for only those people who are looking to see real monkey kung fu demonstrated. If your looking for an entertaining movie, go elsewhere!
The movie is really just an excuse to show off some of the amazing skill of it's star, Chan Siu Chen. Chan was an actual student of Grand Master Chan Sau Chung, standard barrer of the art of TaiShing Pek Kwar (Monkey Kung Fu). He was also a the 1971 lightweight champion in the Southeast Asia Open Martial Arts Tournement. He is an obviously an accomplished fighter and skilled martial artist! One thing he is not, however, is an actor! Nor are most of the people featured in this film.
The film it's self does not appear to be made by professional filmmakers either. For instance, there are times in the film where one would swear that the director simply placed the camera on the ground, or a near by table, and let it roll! Even when there does seem to be someone at the helm, the camera will zoom in on ,literally, nothing! While this may be funny for the first couple of times and/or when you are with a group of friends that wish to watch a little camp, it is very hard not to touch the ffwd button.
As for the story...Well, you know the saying, 'If I ate alphabet soup, I could @%#! a better script."" that about sums it up.
While martial artists will apprciate the 'real' kung fu presented (no wires), I belive it would be a rare person who would actually call this movie good. Yes, the fight scenes are authentic but are quite few and far between, not really worth the effort to find if you don't posses some fanatical interest in the martial arts. Add to al the above, the mvie is dubbed into english and the voices are completely ridiculous!
This is a true Grindhouse school, crappy Kung Fu flick, but, some people like that kind of thing. If you are one of them this is for you!",1083110400,11,1856,4.351585014409222
624411,5,6303308651,"Monkey Kung Fu is one of the best kungfu films demonstrating monkey style. Other films such as the original Iron Monkey (1977) and Mad Monkey Kung Fu are also excellent, but their monkey style fight choreography does not match this film. The film is a true traditional kungfu movie, with a large amount of comedy. There is also some very strange and comical music in this film, but that does not subtract from the film, it only adds to the comedic element.
The plot consists of a young man wanting to learn kungfu from an old monkey style master, at first the master won't take him as his student, but he eventually does. A kungfu master who specializes in the snake style is also going around town demanding protection money from all local kungfu schools and beating up all the masters. However, he can't beat the old monkey master, so he retreats to the forest to train for their next battle. Meanwhile, the hero of the film is learning monkey kungfu from the old master.
There is a lot of comedy in the film, and it is actually sort of funny (which is rare in kungfu films). The movie also has a fight scene about every five minutes-- there is no shortage of action. The cinematography in the film is excellent, but this version of the film is not widescreen so it cannot be fully appreciated. Parts of the shot are also cut out sometimes because it is a fullscreen version. The best part of the film is near the end, when the hero is learning kungfu; the training sequences are very good, and the final fight with the snake style master is a true masterwork of choreography.",1041724800,9,1578,4.482638888888889
7843421,5,6303308651,"Shaw Brothers did something in 1979 that a film company rarely does. They put out 2 films which showcase the very same style of martial arts in Monkey Kung Fu & Mad Monkey Kung Fu. Only 1 word separates the 2 films: mad. It's no wonder when Monkey Kung Fu reached the States, it was given the title of Stroke of Death. The director for this one is Lo Mar whose films have run the gamut from romance to drama to yes, kung fu. This film follows the exploits of a prisoner (Ching Siu Tung) who meets a mysterious man in jail who gives him half a medal piece which, when linked together with the other half, leads to a secret kung fu book. The other half belongs to another prisoner (Hau Sau Seng) who is in search of his jailed master. The two break out of prison & set off on a quest to locate the secret manual. Also after the medallion & hot on their trail is the son (Kuan Feng) of a kung fu specialist who was killed in a concert by the jailed master.

This is the 1st starring turn for Ching Siu Tung who, early in his career was more of an action director & just a film extra. He however equips himself quite nicely. With a bit of charm & humor reminiscent of a Jackie Chan, he also shows himself to be very proficient in martial arts. While Hau Sau Seng's film catalog surprisingly isn't that extensive, he plays pretty good off of Ching Siu Tung & his skills are off the charts. He truly sells his drunken monkey style. Kuan Feng has a series of main villain turns in his filmography, mostly under Lo Mar. I place this performance of his here right on par with his showing in 5 Superfighters.

Overall, it's a film with a nice plot, humor that isn't over the top & action that is right up the best that the SB production has even produced. Of the 2 monkey-based kung fu style movies in my opinion, this is the better of the 2!!!",1497484800,,1834,4.163380281690141
