8656364,1,B00K6KSKO2,"I saw this in the library and the box made this video sound impressive. Unfortunately it was not impressive at all.

The video is about longtime NYC street photographer Matt Weber, with interviews of other such photographers as well. Unfortunately much of the video was a lot of chitchat from the various photographers and not many photographs were shown. And the photographs themselves were nothing special. Yes, you briefly see a number of images of various spots around town such as old-fashioned signs, but we get boring talk about how a phone booth dates from the 1960's and other irrelevant subjects. There are other street photographers and videos about them which are far better.",1485734400,,687,5.026315789473684

What i appreciate is that on the other side there is analog and on the other side there is digital photography in descussion.",1481414400,,148,4.730769230769231
8656366,4,B00K6KSKO2,"The parts about Matt Weber were great, but much footage was devoted to other, less talented photographers, including one soft-core porn artist which made me want to throw up, and wonder why the material was even there.",1423958400,,218,4.918918918918919
8656367,4,B00K6KSKO2,"More Than the Rainbow (2012 release; 82 min.) is a documentary about street photography in New York, and in particular chronicles Matt Weber.  As the documentary opens, we are right away introduced to Matt Weber. I assume he is well known in the photographers circles but I admit I had never heard of him. We get to know Matt and he brings his story of how he started taking pictures more than 30 years ago when he was a taxi driver in New York and hes literally shoot pictures from within his cab. Nowadays hes no longer driving a cab and has the good fortune of taking pictures on a full-time basis. Along the way we are introduced to others in New York, including other street photographers, who comment on what they think of Matts work. And of course the documentary includes tons of pictures shot by Matt (and others).

Couple of further comments: first, I cant remember where I read about this documentary recently, but it came highly recommended, and so I sought it out at my local library here in Cincinnati. So glad I did. There is no story line as such in this documentary (unlike in, say, the similarly-themed Finding Vivian Meier recent documentary), but it doesnt affect the viewing experience negatively, as long as you have an interest in photography (and New York, I suppose).  Second, Matt makes some astute observations about life as a photographer, let alone a street photographer. Comments Matt: its a pretty obscure profession. If people are asked to name a photographer, Ansel Adams is often the only name people know. Comments another photographer: the camera saved me from a boring life, ha! Third, the overall feel and mood of the documentary in certain parts of this documentary seemingly comes straight out of Taxi Driver (Martin Scorseses 1975 pic): the setting, the music , etc. Amazing. This leads me to my last, but certainly not least, comment: the music that is featured in this documentary is nothing short ot stellar and spectacular, holy cow. The jazzy-sounding score palys virtually non-stop the entire movie, and much of it is courtesy none other than Thelonius Monk (with tracks like Locomotive, We See, Green Chimneys, Ugly Beauty, Ask me Now, and on and on), and the rest of the music is from Keith Gurland. How in the world were the documentary makers able to get the permission to use all of this Monk music? (Maybe that also explains why there is unfortunately no soundtrack available for purchase, be it digitally, or on CD, vinyl or any other medium.)

Bottom line: if you like documentaries and have an interest in art in general or photography in particular, Id readily recommend you check out More Than the Rainbow, you will not be disappointed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1423008000,,2714,4.792735042735043
8656368,5,B00K6KSKO2,"I just finished watching this, and it's something I'll want to watch again & again.  For those who have a passionate love for street photography and for NYC, this documentary is a gift.",1416614400,,185,4.606060606060606
8656369,5,B00K6KSKO2,"Superb film on multiple levels. MTTR speaks to the spirit, to obsession, to joy and to madness. Chronicling the commedia stupenda of the human condition through the lens of one unlikely, particularly unique and brilliant photographer, MTTR captures everything from solipsism to universalism, from wealth to poverty, from horror to celebration, from despair to hope in the wilderness that is New York. The flow and pace are addictive and aided by a perfect soundtrack. New York is as much a character in the film as the varied and wonderful host of players featured throughout and the symbolism of the film speaks to larger themes. I would highly recommend and thoroughly enjoyed...could have watched for a few more hours as the film lulls and excites you into perfect voyeurism. Bravo.",1408406400,,785,5.093023255813954
8656370,4,B00K6KSKO2,"Matt Weber became known as a street photographer of New York City after he worked for twelve years driving a cab.  The cab paid the bills but Weber became bored. He began observing people in and out of his taxi and the city sites outside of it and soon started taking photographs from the window. Weber eventually took the risky step of selling his cab medallion in order to try to support himself doing what he found he loved -- taking pictures.  Weber lacked any kind of formal education or training in photography or other visual art. This new documentary, ""More than the Rainbow"" (2014) tells Weber's story.

Weber has a feeling for New York City as it was. In the voiceover that opens the film, Weber says that the City has become gentrified over the past 25 years and has lost a degree of its spontaneity and verve. He aims to recapture a large, gritty New York.  Weber strolls through the city streets with his camera snapping photos incessantly as he goes. Photography requires patience.  For every 1000 pictures he takes, according to Weber, perhaps only one will be of artistic quality.  Weber's photographs are all spontaneous rather than posed.  He tries to capture a scene as it unfolds which requires a rare balance to make the photo work. He also takes risks when people do not want to be photographed.

Weber photographs both people and places.  He is most interested in the harsher aspects of city life, including street people, the elderly, the underemployed, the less glamorous areas, prostitutes, and peep shows. Each of these have a substantial place in this documentary. He looks fondly at an old pay telephone booth, one of the few left on the west side of New York. The film also shows Weber at his best in photographing Coney Island, its amusements, beaches, and people, and the underground world of the New York City subway. He is also shown taking photographs of September 11 and of New Yorkers reacting on Times Square to the first inauguration of President Obama.

The film is effective in showing images of Weber's work and in following him through the City as he takes his photographs. It captures the passion that he brings to his work as Weber late in life found his gift and what he was born to do. A jazzy score largely based upon the music of Thelonius Monk offers an accompaniment to the scenes of city streets.

The movie also features interviews with Weber and with several other photographers of New York City who comment on Weber's work and on the art of photography.  The interviews cover different approaches to the art of photography, among other matters.  Some of the discussions are insightful but on the whole they tend to dullness. Good photographers, including Weber, are not always the most inspiring or interesting talkers.  The photographers in the movie have too much to say not all of it worthwhile.  More emphasis on their photos would have been welcome. The DVD includes two sections of bonus materials.  The first is an excellent selection of Weber's photographs beyond those that appear in the film.  The second is additional interview material. As with the film, the photos are evocative and worthwhile, the interviews and talk less so.

""Mpre than a Rainbow"" is an excellent documentary film which helped me see New York City through my own eyes as well as through the eyes of Weber and his fellow photographers. Dan Wechsler, who published Weber's book, ""The Urban Prisoner""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Urban-Prisoner-Photographs-by-Matt-Weber/dp/0975333402/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Urban Prisoner: Photographs by Matt Weber</a>&nbsp;is the director. The distributor of the film, First Run Features, kindly sent me a review copy.

Total Time:  83 Minutes

8656371,5,B00K6KSKO2,"Boy was this a discovery for me! Documentary director Dan Wechsler set out to make a film about New York photographer Matt Weber, whose specialty is street photography  taking candid shots of people in normal situations. Weber has a few gallery exhibits to his credit and an some books as well, though he was unknown to me  until this film. Along the way, Wechsler interviewed Webers friend and fellow photographer Dave Beckerman as well as 3 more street photographers (though one deals more with  photographing professional models and nude women.). So, while the focus is on Weber, we learn a lot about the others as well. All are men except for Zoe Strauss (who I was aware of from her years living in Philadelphia, before she moved to NYC.). Some of the photographs diss Webers techniques (professional jealousy in a competitive photo art market?) while others laud him.

Weber has a great personality and talks a mile a minute but seems like the kind of guy youd call your buddy. There are literally hundreds of images from each of the photographers in this 83 minute film. And as he follows Weber throughout New York (and particularly Coney Island), he makes hi9s own artistic decisions as to what to capture and how to present it.  Theres not a lot of technical language used here but folks who love to use their cameras will appreciate the comments on film vs digital, color vs. black& white.

For the soundtrack to this film Wechsler uses recordings of Thelonious Monk (licensed from a variety of record labels) and original music performed by Keith Gurland as well as Monk pieces performed by Gurland. It blends perfectly.

There are a few bonus features here too.  Theres a 9-minute interview with both Weber and Beckerman. And a few photo galleries plus a single-page text bio of the director.

An additional advisory.  While there are a few expletives used in the film, and there is a brief image of nude women, there is one image of full frontal male nudity (shot by the only female photographer  Zoe Strauss) included. This is just an alert to those showing it to younger children. (the rest of the film is family appropriate).

As I say in the title of this review, anyone who loves New York images or any photographer will definitely want this DVD. But anyone interested in captivating images will want to see this film as well..

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
