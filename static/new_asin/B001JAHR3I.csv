8312700,5,B001JAHR3I,"This ,by far, was the best series ever.  Please release all the episodes on dvd.  The whole cast meshed so well together and our family could not wait for each new episode.  It was so much better than Greys Anatomy and Private Practice.  People wrote in to save it, but it only worked for for a few more shows.  We don't need any more talent shows, or reality shows, just good programs like Men in Trees.",1337558400,5,404,4.2631578947368425
8312701,5,B001JAHR3I,I have seen dvd's for everything but Men In Trees. Can't believe all the stupid shows have dvd's out and not Men In Trees. I wish the viewers had more to say about what they cancel. It's not fare. This was one of the best tv shows ever. I was lucky with Friday Night Lights. At least someone recognized that it was a great show.,1327190400,5,328,4.061538461538461
8312702,5,B001JAHR3I,"Where is the dvd version of this marvelous series?/ It is just being repeated and it has to be the best show i've seen in ages even second time around PLEEEEASE for goodness sake put s out of our misery and put it out on dvd!!! There are so many inferior program put straight on to dvd, and having this sweet intelligent and heartfelt program  being ignored is a travesty. The acting was always outstanding and the scenery at times breathtaking,seeing the characters grow was a pleasure. Why not make another series?? As the show was cancelled in 2006 ,this show really stands the test of time  on repeat viewing does not disappoint and never fails to captivate. Please do something. Give us a release date for the dvd and set our hearts aflutter once again.",1244764800,15,758,4.5661764705882355

8312706,5,B001JAHR3I,"This has to be one of the coolest shows since ""Northern Exposure"". I waited each season to start, recorded it on my DVR..and BAM~...cancelled*? These writers need a V-8!I can complain till I am blue in the face, won't bring it back. But at least I would love to have both seasons to go back and watch. Story lines were great, cast complimented one another, great actors & actresses, VERY sad to see it go....ABC,Can you hear me now?? WAKE up...gheesh*",1236297600,9,451,4.580246913580247
