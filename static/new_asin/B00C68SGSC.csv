8577583,4,B00C68SGSC,"The film is sci-fi'ish with a time frozen tale of a small town (Rockwell) that has not progressed in time ever since a tragic bus accident happened some seventeen years ago that left only one survivor, Johnny Stumbles.  Teenager Hawk Kodiak (Lucas Salvagno) has just arrived by bus from a juvenile facility. He notices the town has not moved forward in time and no one has aged. He befriends several boys who he plays basketball with and there are soon noticeable changes in the town. Of course, everyone is wanting to  know just who this new stranger really is. The acting is well executed and the production value overall is quite good.",1492560000,,638,4.6875

8577585,3,B00C68SGSC,Not a religious movie; like I was expecting. This movie was like a sci-fi movie. The acting was a little off in the beginning but the characters became more believable as the movie went along. The plot was impossible and would NEVER happen but it was entertaining like Cinderella - a fairy tale.,1416096000,,295,4.584905660377358
