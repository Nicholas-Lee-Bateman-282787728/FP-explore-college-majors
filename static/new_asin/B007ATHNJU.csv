8513604,5,B007ATHNJU,"My husband and I have watched this dozens of times.  It makes you think about what you read in the Bible--and you can see the value of assuming that the Bible really is true.  Interesting people and gorgeous scenery keep you interested as you watch.  It's fun to go on the investigation, if only vicariously.

Of the Cornuke videos, this is probably my favorite.  I highly recommend it.",1496448000,,386,4.617647058823529

8513606,5,B007ATHNJU,"Bob Cornuke's explorations are always interesting and always excellent photography. He is always low-keyed and his explorations are done in the style of an investigator. He is always searching for the truth and willing to admit when his explorations aren't as successful as he had hoped. This one, however, gets him excited.",1402444800,,324,5.25
8513607,5,B007ATHNJU,"This is a goo addition to his searies. Not as impressive as some of the others, but still fascinating. We had the other three videos in the series already. Glad we got this one to complete the collection.",1399075200,,204,4.394736842105263
8513608,5,B007ATHNJU,"""Search For The Lost Shipwreck Of Paul"" Debunks the traditional beliefs that the Apostle Paul was shipwrecked on the North-East portion of the Island of Malta where a shrine sits today, commemorating the landing of Paul. Using the Holy Bible (Acts 27) as a guide to the truth, Bob Cornuke discovers the real location of the Apostle Paul's landing with overwhelming evidence. This archeological finding along with many other findings this century has been proving the Holy Bible is not based on myth and legend. Nor is it a book of fables and fairy-tales. But is proven through real archeology to be fact, infallible, inerrant, Holy Spirit inspired (God breathed) Word of God, Word of Truth that all humanity can trust.",1398470400,,718,4.9421487603305785
8513609,5,B007ATHNJU,"This video presents a compelling case that the anchors from St Paul's shipwreck on Malta and the location of the shipwreck have been found. Maltese tradition places St Paul's shipwreck on the northeast coast at a bay which was a busy port even in the 1st century AD.  But following the very detailed information in the Bible, retired police investigator Bob Cornuke, determined that another location on the south end of the island fit the evidence best, and upon investigating further he learned that four ancient Roman anchors had already been recovered at exactly the depth the Bible reports.  The story of his investigation, filmed on location in Malta, is captivatingly told in this video.  I highly recommend this video for anyone interested in the Bible or in Malta.",1395705600,,772,4.9689922480620154
8513610,5,B007ATHNJU,"It shows some anchor stones that have been found in the area that the Apostle Paul was
shipwrecked in and could even be the very anchors.  Well made and interesting.
Not quite as exciting as ""In Search of the REAL Mt. Sinai"" which you must see - you will
never regret it, along with the video ""The Exodus Revealed"".

Two other videos to see are: ""Jesus Christ and the Shroud of Turin"" and ""The Real Face of Jesus"".
Watch them in this order so the ground is set for ""The Real Face of Jesus"".",1393891200,,490,4.202127659574468
