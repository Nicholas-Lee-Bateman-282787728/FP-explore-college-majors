8186634,5,B000OTHVWC,"I had rented this movie and after seeing it, knew that I had to own it. Bought it here at Amazon. Very unusual fight scenes in that they use top gymnasts and other top athletes from China instead of real actors, which makes for a very entertaining movie.",1224979200,,254,4.3125
8186635,4,B000OTHVWC,"Born to Fight is definitely low budget by American standards, very low budget, and to tell the truth I fast forwarded some of the story, but the martial arts scenes were very well worth it, which works out because that's all I expected from the movie.  It is not as impressive as The Protector and Ong Bak, but hey . . .",1224633600,,320,4.161290322580645
