1236356,4,B00000JQSB,"This is an early film from Alfred Hitchcock.  Not one of his early great films but a nice one nonetheless.  An old aristocratic family sells some of their land to a nouveau rich family who plans to develop the land into businesses and houses.  He begins to turn out old families who have lived in cottages for years and cut down trees.  The aristocratic family plots a skin game against the new land owner and his family and take revenge after he breaks his word about what he was going to do with the land they sold him.  Thus begins a rivalry which plots to destroy both families and cause trouble.  I found the movie very well acted and interesting.  It is a filmed play that is barely ""opened"" up for film.  Edmund Gwynn whom we all know as Santa Claus in The Miracle on 42nd Street is the best known actor.  He plays the nouveau rich family head who fears ruin and disgrace to his daughter in law's past.  The film is very nicely staged but doesn't ""feel"" like Hitchcock as The Lodger and Blackmail does.  I think this was one of his jobs in which he was a hired director and not expected to make a signature product.  The ending is a bit awkwardly arty - to highlight the fall of both families and a way of life, a tree that has been chopped at the bottom collapse and falls.  Believe me, he got better.",1331596800,,1309,4.251012145748988
1236357,3,B00000JQSB,"Early Hitchcock films given an admirable restoration. If you have any of the many public domain copies of these films floating around, you'll be impressed by the difference.

Why 3 stars then? Because two scenes near the end of MURDER are inexplicably MISSING!!!

***SPOILER ALERT***
Do not continue reading if you haven't yet seen the film!!!

After the killer hangs himself, there is a scene showing his body being carried off, and the circus people crying over it. A man declares that his neck has been broken, and Herbert Marshall is handed a note that was on the killer's person. It then cuts to Marshall reading the note, basically an admission of guilt and description of how the murder was carried out.

In this restored version the scene is deleted- it cuts from the pandemonium resulting from the killer's suicide straight to Marshall reading the note.

This is somewhat incidental, but the next deletion makes no sense.

In the original film the next scene after Marshall reads the note has him riding away from prison with the actress who had been wrongly convicted of the murder. She is crying, and Marshall says something to the effect of ""don't waste your tears. They can be used in my next play"". (sorry i can't remember the line verbatim, but that's the gist of it). It then cuts to her triumphant final scene in a play, with the audience applauding.

That scene is missing too! In this restored version it cuts from Marshall at the circus, reading the note, straight to that moment of the play ending and the audience applauding.

While it's probably a grand total of 2 minutes deleted, their omission disrupts the continuity of the denoument.
This may seem like splitting hairs, but to any real Hitchcock fan it's unforgivable!",1328486400,,1746,4.796666666666667
1236358,2,B00000JQSB,"Format: Movie
Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Distributor: Wardour Films Ltd.
Release Date: February 26, 1931

When people first hear the title of this film they often think that it is either pornographic or a very violent film involving mutilation of some sort. Let me clear the air by first saying that it is as far as you can get from either of those things. The movie is really about two warring families: the Hillcrists and the Hornblowers. The Hornblowers are attempting to urbanize a particular area and to do such they are purchasing every piece of land in the area but the Hillcrists who has lived in the area for generations do not want the last area of land to be bought up. So a bidding battle begins at the auction house and the battle between the families becomes fiercer than ever. The story is actually pretty interesting and worthwhile with neither family being shown as being right or wrong. It's really up to the audience to decide which family is correct which is good storytelling. So overall a pretty interesting and entertaining story even if the film does end really abruptly.

The acting in the film is underrated but still not anything amazing. C.V. France plays Mr. Hillcrist and Helen Haye plays Mrs. Hillcrist. France does a standup job in his role and really seems like a fierce old man with a firm belief in protecting the land. Helen Haye on the other hand is a weak actress who really doesn't bring anything to the role and really doesn't make the character seem like she cares about what is even going on. Edmund Gwenn plays Mr. Hornblower and he is probably the best actor in this picture. He seems like a real businessman who knows his goal and how to get there. And as for the other actors and actresses in the film, they are all mediocre with no real standouts. So a mixed bag of sorts but not as bad as most people seem to think.

As for the special effects here, you have some pretty decent ones for 1931. All of the sets look really good and the drowned corpse at the end looks really realistic for the time. Now the sound doesn't have nearly the same level of perfection. It cuts out constantly and some parts seem nearly muted which is really bad for any movie of any time period! So great special effects but mediocre music and terrible sound.

To sum up my thoughts on The Skin Game I'll say that it adapts the original play very well especially since plays rarely work in movie format. The story is incredibly entertaining and well done although it has a very abrupt ending which makes me wish that the movie had gone on a little bit longer. One major problem here is the camera which will often chop off people's heads at the top of the screen or keep jittering around which feels really unprofessional. And as for everything else the acting is a mixed bag, the special effects are great, and the sound is abysmal. So a lot of positive and negative qualities in this movie really make it a mixed bag of a film. Check it out if you are a fan of the original play or Alfred Hitchcock's work but don't go out of your way to see it.

1236359,3,B00000JQSB,"This boxed set contains restored versions of Early Hitchcock Films back when he was in Britain, Good Set, Great Video Transfers..But i do have a question? If you are going to restore classic public domain Hitchcock movies why did you choose these? The 4 movies i would have picked are The Lady Vanishes, The 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew Too Much and The Secret Agent...Not these movies",1260576000,,383,4.647058823529412
1236360,4,B00000JQSB,"Gwenn is the familiar standout, pushy and obnoxious......sort of an unclassy guy who got rich and now wants to push the aristocracy around.  He exudes vitality and cunning and the game is on.  But the blows get lower and lower.  The moral standards of both rivals are slowly compromised as they get more desperate to defeat eachother.  It might help to be English and understand how entrenched ""class"" is.  I had an English husband so I got some indoctrination into things and attitudes British.  Gwenn sees nothing wrong with breaking a business promise (that causes the situation) yet he expects promises he extracts to be honored.  The game is between him and the lady aristocrat, as her husband was disgusted with her tactics, but too weak to stop her.

It is not a fast paced movie.  But the plot and tension slowly build and you end up with characters that have morally destroyed themselves in trying to destroy each other..  Very fascinating how the original motives slowly change......What was an excuse for the fight, becomes barely an afterthought.

I found it very intriguing.",1252540800,,1087,4.885245901639344
1236361,3,B00000JQSB,"This early Alfred Hitchcock talkie has whiskers on it, its style is so dated. The Hillcrists, an old-moneyed, conservative landowning family in rural England, run up against the Hornblowers, an up-and-coming, up-to-date family of nouveau riche strivers who want to buy and develop  land encircling the Hillcrists', evicting some old-family-retainer type tenants in the process.
 The dispute escalates, leading to the tragic death of one family member just before the final fadeout. This is an early ""talkie,"" all right; the mostly stiff and very British cast does a lot of talking, without much action. However, the movie is saved from mediocrity, at least in part, by the performance of Edmund Gwenn as Mr. Hornblower, the patriarch of the go-getter family. Yes, he's the same actor who played Kris Kringle in the 1947 Christmas classic ""Miracle On 34th Street."" Here in this 1931 film he is, obviously, 16 years younger, much more vigorous, and gives a fine performance full of energy and a Scottish (or possibly Welsh) accent that provides some welcome relief from the ""posh"" upper-class talk of the Hillcrists.
 A couple of other interesting tidbits about the cast: Mrs. Hillcrist is played by Helen Haye (no, not Helen HAYES; this is a British actress with a similar name). Jill Hillcrist, the couple's daughter, is enacted by Jill Esmond, who just prior to filming had married a rising young British actor named Laurence Olivier.
 And Hitchcock's cinematography is outstanding in the early part of the picture, with several shots of beautiful English forest and countryside, including one which is dissolved perfectly into a painting of the exact same scene in a drawing room. Scenes shot purportedly on the streets in a provincial town are very convincing also, and may well have been done on location.
 This is not a film that Hitchcock will be long remembered for, but it's worth seeing as a curiosity, and also so you can be assured that, yes, Edmund Gwenn did play some parts besides Kris Kringle.",1243814400,,2008,5.036144578313253
1236362,3,B00000JQSB,"I purchased this set a few weeks ago but was only able to view it over the weekend. The restoration of THE MANXMAN, THE RING and, especially THE SKIN GAME superb. However, I was astonished to find that the penultimate scene of MURDER! was missing since it is essential to the entire construction. It looks like the restorers did not have access to a good copy since it went into black frames occasionally and did not parallel the quality of certain VHS copies I've seen.",1186876800,,470,4.541176470588235
1236363,5,B00000JQSB,"This surely is a great set, but you would be better off getting the UK release The Early Hitchcock Collection (available from Amazon.co.uk), with the same transfers and 4 more films missing here: Champagne (a very rare film in the canon), The Farmer's Wife, Blackmail and Number Seventeen. That set is an absolute must for anyone interested in the film career of Alfred Hitchcock, with some of his earlier British films (including 4 silent movies), lovingly restored and with some wonderful extras, most notably an hour long documentary on early Hitchcock. It's amazing how great these movies look on this new masters (infinitely better than all previous releases, that can now be easily dismissed). I just hope that Studio Canal and Optimun Classic get round to release soon the rest of the British films, particularly The Lodger, the first true Hitchcock work only available so far in unwatchable transfers. Some of these films may not be great works of art, up to the standard set by the master in his later opus, but in all of them can be found moments and ideas which speak loud of a real genius in working process. Don't miss it!",1180483200,,1135,4.795918367346939
1236364,5,B00000JQSB,"The 5 films contained in this artfully crafted 3-disc set are really the best versions ever released on US home video.  This collection contains the remastered versions from Studio Canal that look and sound incredible.  While some say ""not Hitchcock's best"" these early films are of great interest to both collectors and fans and those interested in the master's early technique.  The documentary, while brief, is insightful and well done.  Highly recommended.",1170979200,,460,5.347222222222222
1236365,4,B00000JQSB,"First the good news--we get a solid transfers of early Hitchcock with some minor and major classics early in his career. Studio Canal has done a nice job with these and while the transfers aren't scratch free, they look quite good given the age of the source material and quite a bit better than some of the earlier releases of public domain sources. This boxed set (once you open it) looks like an old bound copy of a script. The outside has a photo of Hitch (which reminds me of a deathmask)from the Universal archive.

The first two films in the set ""The Ring"" and ""The Manxman"" were made the year after the success of ""The Lodger"" (which would been shelved when studio executives thought it a disaster. Luckily, Michael Balcon stepped in a man who championed Hitch early in his career and the film was a wild success). ""Murder!"" is an early talkie (sadly the German version isn't included. It would have been nice to see for comparison sake as it was shot with a different cast on the same sets).  In the early days of film alternate versions were shot for other markets where they might be popular usually with a different director. Hitch spoke German since he worked early on in that country shooting films and absorbing much of the early German expressionist styles that he would reference throughout his career)so directed it himself. ""The Skin Game"" and ""Rich and Strange"" (the latter an early Hitchcock classic) are also included. A pity that ""Blackmail"" (Hitch's first talkie that was also shot to be shown as a silent film) isn't included as well.

The bad news is that we don't get any feature length commentary tracks by Hitchcock historians and film scholars (which is just as well if these things bore you). We do, however, get a new 15 minute featurette focusing on Hitchcock's early life, his collaboration with his wife Alma (who is often overlooked--we must remember that it was team Hitchcock collaborating which consisted of Hitch, his wife Alma and whomever their current favorite writer was)and the development of his early style. It features interviews with USC Hitchcock Professor Drew Casper, director Peter Bogdanovich, Hitch's daughter and screenwriter/film historian Steve Haberman. We have a generous amount of clips from the set illustrating their points. I do wish that ""The Lodger"" had been included in this set but that's a pretty minor point (although honestly it does belong here as an example of his developing sense of style). Also missing is Hitch's ""Number 17"" which would have been a natural to include in this set even though the plot is a bit confusing, it's a fun ride.

This is an excellent collection of early minor classics as Hitch developed his film style. It's clear that he was influenced by seeing other directors such as Fritz Lang and FW Murnau but he had already begun to develop his own distinctive voice as a film director. This is a good set to get and is a pretty inexpense handsome package for fans.",1170892800,,2960,4.764132553606238
1236369,4,B00000JQSB,"I'm very glad Canal has invested in restorations for these early Hitchcock films.  There probably isn't much money in these restorations as the films have been in public domain for decades and can be found in every DVD bargain bin.  They look very good for their age but I question some of the ""foley"" work added to the soundtracks.  In the sound films, it is obvious that tinkling glass sound effects and other little audio nuances have been mixed in to the old mono track.

The films will be primarily of interest to an avid Hitchcock fan, with their subjective camera tricks and embellishments, early examples of the Hitchcock style.  ""Murder"" yields some interesting moments, such as the melodramatic musical cue of ""Tristan and Isolde"", later used as a basis for Bernard Herrmann's ""Vertigo"" score.

Looking forward to a second volume from Canal.",1170892800,,851,4.916083916083916
1236370,4,B00000JQSB,"Throw out those Madacy & Laserlight DVD's!  The U.K. Studio Canal 35mm Masters are here, professionally released with little artifacting by Lions Gate!

I would have given this DVD box set 5 stars except that 1) These are not Hitchcock classics, they are good examples of his early work but they are no Psycho, 2) While mastered from 35mm, they did not get the Criterion treatment of removing scratches & dirt specks.  Still this is a great improvement over previous releases of these titles.  I only wish ""NUMBER 17"" was in this set, that early classic deserves the Studio Canal treatment.

This set features a mix of silent films & early sound British films.  There is also a nice 15 minute bonus on disc 3 that explains the difficulties of filming sound films in 1930 and how Hitchcock got around the problems.

Disc #1 : Two Silent Films

""THE RING"" (1927) - Two boxers fall in love with a girl named Nellie. Very visual, early signs of Hitchcock's style.

""MANXMAN""  (1929) - Hitchcock's last silent film! A Love story about two fishermen & a landlord's daughter.

Disc #2 : Two early sound films

""MURDER""  (1930) - the 104 minute U.K. version, good suspence drama.  A jurer re-thinks his verdict and investigates the crime himself.

""SKIN GAME""  (1931) - Based on a John Galsworthy play, a little stagy. A traditional family battles a (then) modern family over land.  Not as racey as the title would suggest.

Disc #3 : One more ""talkie"" and a bonus feature

""RICH AND STANGE""  (1931) - Unexpected riches don't bring happiness for a married couple.  A tale with a moral.

""THE HITCHCOCK WAY""  (2007)  - 15 minute documentary interviewing Alfred's daughter and surviving crew members as well as film historians.  Of special interest is the explanation of how difficult it was to work in early sound films and how Hitchcock got around the problems in 1930.",1170892800,,1861,4.740625
1236371,1,B00000JQSB,"Generally I find the early Hitchcock films unique in different ways but this one could have ANY directors name on it and it would still be a bad film.  It doesn't have that 'Hitch' feel to it and if the first reviewer was correct in saying he was forced to do it -- I believe it.

I couldn't even understand the actors so I went looking for subtitles hoping there would be an English set but no such luck, I just had to wait for half an hour for my ears to adjust to the dialects, then I could understand why I was I was bored.

The auction scene is the only one that bears any resemblence to a Hitchcock movie.  Small wonder I paid more for the shipping and handling than I did for the film.",1157241600,,692,4.029197080291971
1236372,1,B00000JQSB,"Rumour has it, Hitchcock was forced by British International Pictures to direct this film against his will and one would be tempted to believe it after only a few minutes into the film. The movie is a boring, plodding feature about 2 rival land owners who like to talk talk talk!! Little to no action, little to no character motivation, little to no interest. Hitchcock appeared to be more interested in applying his talents elsewhere.
...As if the film isn't bad enough on it's own, this terrible, terrible video transfer by Laserlite makes the miserable experience even worse! Laserlight simply copied an already existing VHS transfer of the film, which is made apparent by several VHS tracking flaws in the film. This is totally unacceptable on a DVD! To make matters worse, the cropping is the worst I've ever seen in any movie transfer! In some scenes entire heads are cut off, leaving the viewer listening to disembodied voices talking and talking and talking for long periods of time. Wether or not the bad cropping was caused by Laserlite or the VHS transfer is irrelevant. It's bad and it shouldn't be printed this way on DVD. No matter how bad a film is, it shouldn't be treated in such a manner. The Dial M for Murder trailer and Tony Curtis' uninformed banter do not improve the entertainment experience one bit. Don't let this turn you off of these Laserlite Hitchcock DVDs, though. Most of them are good and a couple, even excellent. This is not one of those.
1 star to Hitchcock for not trying very hard in 1931, and 1 star star to Laserlite for not trying very hard in 1998",1044316800,,1589,4.638297872340425

This is one of several early Hitchcock films that I'm sure would have been lost without trace had Hitchcock's name not appeared on the credits. In fact, Hitckcock probably wished it had disappeared without trace; there really is very little to commend this dull, boring movie. As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are of an acceptable standard and Laserlight has also included a trailer for 'Dial M For Murder'. But there's no getting away from the fact that this is a cheapie DVD for Hitchcock completists only.",961891200,,595,4.730769230769231
1236374,3,B00000JQSB,"Hitchcock may be the master of suspense, but this movie doesn't show that mastery fully-developed. The movie starts out strong, and builds to a great climax, but then wraps up abruptly. The movie shows much of Hitchcock's  skill at building suspense, but doesn't deliver an ending to match the  rising tension. It's too bad, because the build-up is very strong. Pay  attention to the epilogue scene for great use of irony.
About the title:  A ""skin game"" means a swindle, trick, or scam.
The movie starts  with Hornblower (Edmund Gwenn) buying property from the proud, proper  English landowner Hillcrest (C.V. France), assuring him that the tenant  farmers would be allowed to stay. Soon Hornblower evicts them to build  factories, because he is a man of progress and industry. Hillcrest is  outraged, and sets out to stop Hornblower's efforts to buy up land for more  factories.
Hillcrest attempts to slow down Hornblower's land purchases by  rigging an auction on some property that's up for sale. But Hornblower  figures out the scheme, and outsmarts Hillcrest with his own tricks.  Hillcrest escalates the feud by hiring a man to dig up dirt on Hornblower  and his family.

Also the quality of transfer to digital is limited by the condition of the original film (or negative).  If you can get past that its a pretty good tale. Even in 1931 there some scenes that have Hitchcock did this written all over them.  Typically there are no innocents, just degrees of guilt.  Sound was new at the time. The first feature length talkie had been released only four years before.  For a while talking films were pretty much like silent movies but with sound substituting for inter-titles.

7913147,2,B00000JQSB,"I bought this set unopened.  I bought it to hopefully own MURDER in a restored version.  While the print was ok it had several gaps in which the screen turned black!  Evidently due to nitrate decomposition.  I had seen MURDER which I taped off PBS in 1979 after Hitch died.  It was a beautiful BFI print with No flaws.  Unfortunately I no longer have the tape.
Political correctness is being used to destroy MURDER.  Because the killer is gay.  They say in the movie IN COURT basically ""Anybody can be a murderer so do not be surprised by who is the Murderer!""
He didn't want his secret revealed so he killed the woman before she could tell.  Everybody knew he was gay so the ""secret"" was obviously not too secretive.
After the suicide of the killer, the body is carried on a stretcher and you see many people milling about and you see Sir John receive an envelope written to him & left for him in his dressing room.  This scene is CUT.  All you see is Sir John reading the letter.  No Body No People Milling No Letter Given To Him.  THERE IS NO REASON TO CUT THIS SCENE!  except political correctness.  So a killer takes his own life rather than be killed by the courts.  Happens often.  STUDIO CANAL has NO RIGHT to cut this movie.  Its Bad enough the print has ten Drop Outs in which the screen goes BLACK in the middle of talking!  But a Hitchcock Memorial BOX SET with his face should NOT have a deliberately destroyed print when A PERFECT ONE exists at BFI.  Didnt you hear about the NEW RESTORATIONS of Hitchcock?

A man has the trees on his estate cut down to build cottages. He talks to a young woman on horseback. Sheep block a road, there is a traffic conflict. One couple doesnt want to move from their home but they will be forced out. They appeal to the landowner. What can he do? The cottages will be needed for the workers in the new factory. The new owner represents progress, not tradition. He means business. Is this unneighborly? They show a street in the village. One man talks about electric lights. Will the bidding be fixed? The land is well-watered, and has mineral rights (clay). Two men bid for the 200 acres. The Dukes agent is the high bidder. Mr. Hornblower tells what happened. Was this a foul trick?

There is gossip about the Hornblower family. Chlo has a headache; her father went bankrupt. Later she tells Charlie about her condition. [I had trouble following the conversation.] They tell Hornblower about his daughter-in-law. Is this slander? A man enters the room to verify the charges. Dont tell Charlie she pleads. They talk about a deal. Theres no witness to this conversation says Mrs. Hillcrest. There is a contract to sign for the deal. They swear, as long as the Hornblower family do them no harm. She had to make her living in all sorts of ways. Charlie returns and tells what he learned; he is angry. Dawker tells what he said to Charlie. Chlo had an accident! Hornblower is angry, and leaves. Are the Hillcrest hands clean? The last scene shows an old tree being cut down.

This is from a short story by John Galsworthy. It tells about the culture of that era. Did the squire use private investigators to even the score? Did Charlie marry a woman he knew little about? The movie The Net warned against posting personal information that anyone can read and use against you. You can be anyone you want to be don the Internet. Marrying a stranger can result in unforeseen problems. Its best to have as much knowledge as possible when making any long-term commitment.

The Amazon reviews often get jumbled together, so I'll mention this review is for the Lions Gate/Studio Canal box, the one with the dead-hitchock face on the cover.  The transfers for these old 1920s/30s pictures are pretty decent on the whole, though I docked a star for some minor blackouts here and there in Murder!, as well as a few minutes of missing footage near the end (which other reviewers have pointed out) that doesn't really ruin the story, though it creates minor discontinuity.  Also, the sound on Rich and Strange seemed just a little off, almost like excessive noise reduction.

All 3 talkie films have English close-captioning, which can be useful with older films even if you have good hearing.  Note that close-captioning gives you the same effect as subtitles, but it's usually activated from the TV's menu rather than from the DVD menu.

I bought the set mostly to see Murder!, the first film covered in William Rothman's book _Hitchcock The Murderous Gaze_.  I'll say the film's not bad, but I thought it drags in parts, it might be a little long at 1 hour 47 minutes.  Also, an important plot point near the end depends on a social stigma that I actually had to look up on wikipedia; presumably it made more sense to 20s audiences.

I'd like to say a few words about The Skin Game, which follows Murder! on this set.  RottenTomatoes.com gave it the lowest rating of any Hitchcock film (17% approval circa 2016).  I actually enjoyed this film pretty thoroughly for the first 30 minutes, so I was mystified by the low rating.  It's less interesting as it goes on, but still not a bad story overall.  Edmund Gwenn really carries the film at the beginning, playing a pushy capitalist with all the earmarks of the successful sociopath:  egotistical, confident, greedy, competitive, vindictive, and able to take offense at the slightest perceived insult.  This is the same actor who plays the talkative, friendly assassin who tries to push the hero out of a building in Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent.  He's also the main star of the 50's-era Hitchcock film The Trouble With Harry, and he picked up an award for his portrayal of Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street.  So I thought it's at least a halfway-good film with a few well-done scenes and one memorable performance.",1455667200,,2598,5.191846522781774
7913151,2,B00000JQSB,"Film = 1-1/2 stars;  restoration = 0 star.  Hard to tell where the results of primitive movie making (even by contemporary standards) leave off and the results of a primitive public-domain VHS copy transferred directly to DVD begin.  Overall, its one ugly mess!  Audio and video are often not synchronized (a simple fix to correct during transfer).  Scene framing is all over the place.  Same for scene over/under exposure.  Sound comes and goes to the point where the viewer may wish this was a silent film with intertitles.  Muddled sound and turgid English accents call for subtitles!  The story (such as it is) is a pot-boiling bore (far from a thriller or a mystery) and the script is simple minded with the phrase skin game frequently repeated but never clearly defined (perhaps English audiences in the early 1930s knew what it meant?).  Acting is overly melodramatic and seems more fitting for the live theater (the film was based on a stage play).  The performance of the lead male actor  is way, way over the top.  Uncredited film music is good.  Bottom line:  Stay clear of this disaster (unless you happen to be the most dedicated of film historians).  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1399334400,,1187,4.830845771144278

7913153,4,B00000JQSB,A good transfer of The Ring an early Hitchcock silent film.  The picture quality is very good but imperfect.  Interesting story featuring a circus boxer who to please his girl becomes a professional boxer.  I enjoyed seeing an early Hitchock film and how his work was influenced by other filmmakers before he developed his own distinctive style.,1366502400,,345,5.017543859649122

7913155,5,B00000JQSB,"When I was younger, these films couldn't be seen on TV or in a theatre, I only could read about them in books where it often seemed that they were mentioned as lost or in poor condition.  Sometimes it was said they weren't that great anyway so no loss, right?  I am very pleased that Studio Canal and Lionsgate took these films out of the public domain where they were being neglected and brought them together in a restored DVD set where they can be viewed by many people.  I found each film to be enjoyable in their own way and very worthy of being seen.  The Ring is a great film with many Hitchcock touches in the cinematography.  The Manxman, Murder and The Skin Game are less like ""Hitchcock"" films because sound made them more static in movement but are very worthy films.  They were also stories taken from famous books and plays in which Hitchcock was trying to be faithful to the original creations.  The documentary is fascinating and narrated by wonderful people.  In it I learned that the sound tracks for films such as Murder were recorded right onto the film so no cuts or dubs were able to be made.  They show a scene from Murder where a character is talking to himself in the bathroom mirror as he shaves.  The scene required the actor to manage shaving and talking, without error and looking into the bathroom mirror while doing so.  In addition, since music couldn't be added later, there was an orchestra close by playing the background music.  Hitchcock was able to set the scene up and coordinate this.  He was seen as being creative in the silent cinema and then being able to do things with early sound other filmmakers wouldn't attempt.  The last film is Rich and Strange when sound was getting better in 1931.  It is a nice story about a young couple who lose their way when they come into some money and go on a trip around the world.  Of course some hard times crop up and they find their way back to their ""roots.""  I never really knew how good these films are from reading about them in books.  I wonder if the authors of those Hitchcock fan books had seen them.  I doubt it.  These films are not great masterpieces but tell an essential story about Hitchcock and can stand on their own as good films.",1331596800,,2231,4.421568627450981
