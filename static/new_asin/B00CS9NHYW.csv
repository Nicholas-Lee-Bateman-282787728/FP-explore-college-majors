8585683,4,B00CS9NHYW,"Four PERILOUS Stars. Stampede is a 1949 black & white film about tensions in the Old West. As the westward expansion across the US proceeds in this movie, its the nesters versus the cattlemen around the town of Blackwell, and the land owners are growing desperate. Full of gunfights, brawls, flirtations, and, yes, even a stampede, it is a great representation of the western movies of the day. A little inconsistent at times, but enjoyable never the less. Starring veteran western actor Rod Cameron and future TV star Gale Storm (My Little Margie), another western veteran in Johnny Mack Brown, Don Castle, Donald Curtis, John Miljan, Jonathan Hale, John Eldredge, Adrian Wood, and co-produced by future famed producer/director Blake Edwards. Directed by Lesley Selander. Very Definitely Recommended for old western movie fans. Four STALWART Stars. (Allied Artists films. Not Rated but with the expected shootings and fights. Black & White. SD. CC. X-Ray. Time-1:16:45.)",1528761600,,971,5.311688311688312

8585687,5,B00CS9NHYW,"First class, underated western with a great cast, the action scenes are surprisingly realistic and ahead of their time. I cannot recomend this release highly enough. As usual with these Archive titles, good quality as well.",1388188800,3,223,5.222222222222222
8585688,4,B00CS9NHYW,"Rod Cameron is not a cowboy in the mould of  Autry or Rogers, Scott or Stewart but the Canadian  is a breath of fresh air. Tall, powerful & believeable with a great Canadian drawl was in superior B westerns such as Stampede. A good story, excellent cast such as the tasty Gale Storm - hard to believe her name, but Cottle her real name not acceptable in Hollywood & Johnny Mack Brown, a B star in westerns perhaps past hus best, but still a dominant figure. The script was part written by Blake Edwards, who went on to greater things. The story is unusual in that the "" hero"" Cameron is seen in an unfriendly role at the outset, but as the film progresses the viewer gets to grips with what is happening, his relationship with his brother being a major factor. Needless to say the love interest initially opposed  to Cameron is later
Taking him by ""storm""......
This above average B western in B&W is well worth adding to your collection.",1385337600,5,938,4.441860465116279
8585689,4,B00CS9NHYW,This was an enjoyable western with Rod Cameron and Johnny Mack Brown going up against bad guy Donald Curtis in a fun western that includes a spectacular cattle stampede. If you enjoy westerns of this period I would recommend it for a watch in the evening...it sure beats what you will find on TV mostly these days.,1379030400,,314,4.526315789473684
8585690,4,B00CS9NHYW,"It was a pleasant surprise to see this release. Rod Cameron is still underrated as a western star - not quite as well-remembered as the post-war trio of Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea and Audie Murphy, but he most certainly ought to be placed in their company, considering the quality of his output. Releases of his westerns on VHS and DVD have been intermittent, so any opportunity to add to the collection should be seized forthwith, especially if further titles are deemed economic enough to bring out. The print of 'Stampede' is very acceptable, considering the extreme rarity of the film. Further suggested titles would include 'Ride The Man Down' (once available on VHS), 'Yaqui Drums', 'Brimstone' and the big-budget 'San Antone'. 'Dakota Lil' has just been released in the UK. A great many so-called 'B+ Westerns' made between the years 1945 and 1960 lie in obscurity (save for occasional TV airings) but Rod Cameron in particular, with his rugged persona and thick-set voice, was always a star who 'fitted the part' superbly well, so my advice would be to purchase this present title - long forgotten - while it is available.",1376870400,5,1131,4.9267015706806285
8585691,4,B00CS9NHYW,"Stampede with Rod Cameron and directed by Lesley Selander was released on dvd at the same time as Short Grass by the same team and also with formibable Johnny Mack Brown as the town marshall. But as Short Grass is super ( you can read my review ) this western is a bit boring. There is too long between the action and too much talk. There are lots of great actors, loveable mainstays and the landscabes being an important part of the film. And the top point is: Thank you that we are able to watch these middle weight westerns!",1372377600,7,527,4.28
8585692,5,B00CS9NHYW,"During the late 1940s actor Rod Cameron graduated from playing B-level Westerns--he did several for Universal in the early and mid 1940s--to major roles, first for Universal (River Lady, Frontier Gal, and Pirates of Monterrey), then 20th Century Fox (Dakota Lil, Belle Starr's Daughter). Republic would pick him up for another eight, including two (Brimstone and Ride the Man Down) that appeared a number of years ago on VHS cassette. Three of his best oaters were made by Allied Artists, the higher quality releasing agent for Monogram Pictures (he made three shorter color films for Monogram, as well, which are available on Warner Archive). Perhaps the best of the three was Panhandle, which has seen a very nice release from VCI Entertainment, from an original sepiatone print. Now Warner Archive has released the other two Allied Artists productions: Stampede and Short Grass. And both are very welcomed additions to the stable of available Western films on DVD. Stampede was released in 1949; it is a trim 77 minutes long. Production values are high, and the film compares very favorably in quality with other ""little A"" Westerns being released at the time. The Warner print is clear and quite decent.

In addition to Rod Cameron, Allied Artists assembled a solid cast, including Johnny Mack Brown as the town sheriff, Don Castle, Gale Storm, Donald Curtis, and John Miljan--all of whom were no strangers to Westerns. The dependable Lesley Selander directs.

I first saw Stampede many years ago at a local film festival, and I was impressed with it then, as I continue to be now. The plot line is taut and believable. The action is swift and exciting---and I still have questions about the famous ""cattle stampede"" towards the end of the film. Cameron is a solid actor, in some ways resembling Randy Scott in his acting. And Johnny Mack Brown is a special treat. As he proved in such films as Wells Fargo, Johnny can act in a BIGGER Western: he's good, very good.

In short, this is a fine film, worth investigating. I'm delighted to have it out on DVD-R.",1369612800,3,2061,4.866096866096866
