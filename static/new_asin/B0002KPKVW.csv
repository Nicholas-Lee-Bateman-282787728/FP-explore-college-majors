8316135,4,B0002KPKVW,"I can honestly say I had never seen any of the shorts on this public domain DVD before. A YouTube search revealed only one (""The Well - A Parable"") available for online viewing and none of these are even listed on imdb.

Two of these shorts (""The Well"" and ""Neverhasbeen"") are clearly dubbed versions of Eastern European shorts (""The Well"" being Polish and ""Neverhasbeen"" apparently being Russian). ""The Well"" is a nice stop-motion animated piece and the dubbing makes sense. ""Neverhasbeen,"" also stop-motion, seems to struggle with the translation, trying to explain a honey jar labeled ""Mez"" by saying it will ""mezmerize"" you.

""Anatole & The Piano"" is a barely-animated narration of the classic Children's book. Similar to the Curious George interstitials I used to see on Nick Jr.

""Notes on Music - Percussion: The Beats Go On"" is an educational piece produced in the 1960s (when elementary schools still had music class). It features famous drummer Shelly Manne.

""The Noisy Underwater World of The Weddell Seal"" actually has some fascinating research footage taken in Antarctica in the 1960s(?).

It's amazing to think how many pieces of film have just been forgotten over the decades, even with the comprehensive world of online cataloging. Hopefully any potential fans of these shorts find their way to the dollar store soon!",1263686400,,1334,5.10091743119266
