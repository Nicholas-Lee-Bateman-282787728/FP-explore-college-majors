It's unfortunate that many of the classic Mexican films of the 70's that have been released on DVD, look like they were transferred from worn out and faded VHS tapes. This particular title ""Prision de mujeres"" with its respectable cast, deserves a full restoration, and subtitles for the English speaking world! I remember the fire-hose scene in the courtyard had ample nudity from the women in the prison, it was cut for this DVD release. It seems to be the normal practice these days, female nudity is prohibited (especially if there's pubic hair; remember this was made back in 1977), but extreme violence is perfectly acceptable! I wonder if today's generation of cinephiles, have any idea of how much more so-called artistic freedom was enjoyed by filmmakers in the 70's (Europe and Latin America in particular). But to some extent, even the Hollywood films were more honest and less sanitized than today. That's why it's important to know who is distributing or releasing the film. To illustrate my point: there are film co.'s like Facets for example, that take great care in releasing films in their original and uncut form. let's hope that this trend of releasing sanitized versions (censorship) of every type of film comes to an end!

Love and Peace,
