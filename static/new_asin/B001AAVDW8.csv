Filmed originally as ""Les Passengers"" in french, instead of driving across the US, this film places the main characters on a drive from Rome to Paris. This version is English-dubbed and actually isn't all that distracting as many dubbed films can be. Now, if only there was a DVD version...",1370822400,,357,4.774193548387097

I watched the German dubbed version dozens of times, but always wanted to show this thriller to my husband.
""The Intruder"" aka ""Les Passagers"" is a road movie and thriller combined, but even than Stephen Spielberg's ""Duel"" which I also like.
The US dubbing has been done very well and compared with the German dubbing nothing is missing in the dialogues.
It's based on a short story by Dean Koontz.

The Trintignant character just got married to the Mireille Darc character and she asked him to pick up her car in Rome (she used to be a flight attendant, then moved to Paris where she met her second husband = Trintignant).
At the same time while driving her car from Rome to Paris, he has to pick up Darc's little son from her first marriage who attends a Catholic boarding school somewhere in Italy. He is about 11 or 12.

That's when the road trip starts. Darc's son notices a black van following them on the highways. Trintignant doesn't take it serious at first, but soon realizes he better does...

I can highly recommend this movie to all Trintignant fans. You won't be disappointed and it also proves that French movie directors can create thrilling movies as well as the Americans.
If you enjoyed ""Tell No One"", you might enjoy this film from the mid seventies as well.",1359849600,,1363,4.62396694214876
