7858713,5,6303987702,"What can I say - these guys were the best. After watching ""Crime School"" and ""Dead End"" when I was a kid I was a #1 fan of these guys. I have most of their movies on tape or DVD and really enjoy watching them over and over(My wife thinks I'm nuts).These guys were so good in their movies that it didn't even seem like they wew acting. I have read how they really tore up Hollywood back in the 30's when Jack Warner brought them out to make movies. They were the real rebels of those early days not just on the screen but off to. This series is pretty good but if you really want to get down and see the really good stuff check out the early movies when Billy Halop,Hunts Hall,Leo Gorcy,Gabe Dell,Benard Punsley and Bobby Jorden were working togeather. I'm talking before they were the East Side Kids and The Bowery Boys, just the good old Dead End Kids. Make sure you check out ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", ""Crime School"" and ""Dead End"". They starred with some really Big names like Bogart, Cagney, Garfield and yes our Finest American President Mr. Ronald Reagon. These guys can really claim a Top Spot in Hollywood History. They make todays young actors look like they crawed out of a ""Slop Bucket!""
By the way they are all dead now and several died pretty young. The last to die was Benard Punsley and that was only a couple years ago as he became a Medical Doctor after leaving the Dead End Kids!

Total Time: 240 mins on 2 VHS ~ VCI Entertainment 1736 ~ (1/29/1996)",1133395200,,7343,5.220512820512821
7858716,2,6303987702,"A mysterious saboteur known as the ""Sea Raider"" has been destroying Allied merchant ships. Four wharf rats (Billy, Toby, Bilge, and Butch, played respectively, if not respectfully, by Halop, Hall, Dell, and Punsly) try to find out who the Sea Raider is. Meanwhile, Billy's big brother has invented some really nifty stuff, including a new type of torpedo boat, that the Sea Raider wants, and big brother works for Captain Carlton, who is really the Sea Raider, so there's all kinds of chicanery going on, and aren't you sorry you asked?

Reed Hadley, who played the lead in the great ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION (1939), must've done something terrible in his life, because only two years after that he's reduced to playing stooge for the Dead End Kids. He's an extremely unbelievable foreign agent; they may as well have signed Kate Smith to play a Nazi. There're a lot of other people in this serial, but for the sake of any good performances they may have given elsewhere, I won't mention them. Except for William Hall. Him I want to hurt. He plays a combination harbor cop and truant officer, he's dating somebody's sister (I forget whose, and it doesn't matter anyway) and he's a big, dumb, stupid clod and I hate him. And if you think I'm being too harsh, well, you should just see him. This isn't much of a chapterplay to begin with; we don't need some buttinsky copper hobbling around, spoiling what little quality in the film there is to begin with.

Most Universal serials run out of gas in the late going, and this one is no exception. The Universal chapterplay writers seem to try and jumpstart the stalled plot (or, more likely, they've simply lost any vestige of sobriety) in the final few episodes, and take the serial in a weird direction, and that's just what happens here. In chapter 8, the Boys are shanghaied by a whaling ship and nearly drown when they get caught in a harpoon's rope. In chapter 9, Halop gets eaten (nearly) by an octopus. In his underwear. That is, Halop, not the octopus, is wearing underwear. He took his clothes off for no apparent reason (all of the other Kids kept their modesty) except to match some antediluvian stock footage. In chapter 10, the Kids, shipwrecked on an island, get eaten by a panther. Nearly. I think they get away by smacking him on the nose with one of those concrete-like pretzels I used to buy from a street vendor in Manhattan at the entrance to the 3rd Avenue subway.

Wow. I got so wrapped up in the plot that I nearly forgot you all were still here. I will give you a special reward for staying with through so much blithering nonsense: I'll wrap up the review now. Or nearly now. I have to tell you my favorite part of the serial: the soundtrack. Folks, you've GOT to hear this. Whereas most Universal serials of the period simply reuse the score from BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and other horror hits, somebody at Universal thought it would be a good idea to play classical music during this chapterplay. And if that's not bad enough, the music was apparently just chosen at random. It's as if they had forgotten to create a score for it, simply grabbed a stack of classical 78s, and recorded them, willy-nilly. You won't believe your own ears as gentle, lilting Rossini tunes are played over fight scenes. You'll doubt your own sanity. You'll wonder why, lord, why, and so I'm going to give you the answer: Because.

The Alpha DVD is a 3  on a scale of 1-10. Not worse than the typical Alpha product, but certainly not better, either.",1100390400,6,3497,4.597756410256411
7858717,1,6303987702,"This serial is an outstanding example of why so many of the Universal serials of the 1940-1944 period were inferior to their Republic counterparts. In this case much of the Universal formula for making  inferior serials is evident: intensive use of stock-shots, very poor  production values, dull writing, continuous use of Mendelssohn's Fingal  Cave Overture which is completely unrelated to the action that is going on  screen. Universal's good serials in the forties are few and far between.  This is one of their worst.",941673600,9,523,5.178571428571429
