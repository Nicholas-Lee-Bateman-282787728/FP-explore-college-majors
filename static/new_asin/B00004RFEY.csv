7921178,1,B00004RFEY,"If the shoddy look of this DVD doesn't convince you of the poor quality of this video, maybe all the negative reviews will.  This is an unofficial video that features a few fan interviews, a few minutes of biographies on the Dixie Chicks, and a bunch of useless fluff to fill the other 40 minutes (which isn't to say that the entire video isn't fluff).  It looks like an 8th grade film project that someone started the night before it was due.
There is NO MUSIC ON THIS VIDEO!",1076544000,15,476,4.337078651685394
7921179,1,B00004RFEY,"This is not even endorsed by the Chicks.  No music on it. Very borning.  Waste of money.  If you need the Chicks on DVD,  buy the evening with the Dixie Chicks worth the $$$.",1055548800,17,174,4.029411764705882
7921180,1,B00004RFEY,"I listened and found this dvd lacked any type of enthusiasm. I believe the band will be better if they got rid of natalie, her performance on this video was weak and for the ringo starr of the dixie chicks. She is lucky that the rest of the band makes up for her lack of talent.
The approach to this video was one where ego trumped talent, knowing that it will sell no matter what was on it.
I played once and dumped it",1051142400,4,419,4.0
7921181,1,B00004RFEY,"and spat out by the content. This is horrible-- very little of the Dixie Chicks, and no music. Of course, I'm an idiot-- had I read the other reviews, I would have known the score, but the One-Touch button lured me in. Stay away...stay very far away.",982800000,48,250,4.340425531914893

7921183,1,B00004RFEY,Don't buy this.  The least we expect is some of Dixie Chicks music to accompany the biography.  There was none at all and all you get is blah blah blah.  A real disappointment for  fans of Dixie Chicks.,973814400,36,202,4.2368421052631575
7921184,1,B00004RFEY,"My mistake in buying this was in not reading the entire video description.  If you enjoy ""blah, blah, blah"", you'll love this video.",954806400,24,132,4.739130434782608
7921185,1,B00004RFEY,"I agree with Neal.  I, too, am a true Dixie Chicks fan and this video is not worth buying.  The narrator is boring and the video is very out of date.  It doesn't have any good footage and the people they interview have  nothing to do with the chicks.  Don't buy it!",954374400,37,265,4.019230769230769
