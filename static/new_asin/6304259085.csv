8161595,3,6304259085,"Taken simply as a fast-paced shoot-'em-up action thriller, this film works well enough. But the actions and motivations behind Ed Harris (General Hummel) and the Force Recon marines who side with him leave much to be desired. A few simple facts for those interested:
 Marines volunteer for Force Recon, and they do so with full knowledge of the risks and sacrifices being asked of them, including annonimity. These gentlemen are not in the military for college benefits. They are warriors, and have chosen  to live - and die, if needed - in a warrior culture. So the idea that a high-ranking officer and active members would desert and become terrorists is both ridiculous and repugnant, for to do so would betray the honor and sacrifice of the men who had died in combat.",1030665600,3,772,4.796992481203008
8161596,5,6304259085,"This is my all time favorite. First of all the 3 main characters are played by great actors. The story is also very interesting. You also feel some kind of sympathy for General Hummel(Ed Harris),the bad guy. You know he's  actually a man with a cause and though he threatens the government to kill  80.000 people,you somehow feel that he won't do it,but you can never be  sure. And one more thing is that the music is superb and adds even more  excitement to a wonderful movie. Besides,there are great dialogs and the  humor is not missing either. It's a must-see by all means.",911433600,,577,4.509615384615385
