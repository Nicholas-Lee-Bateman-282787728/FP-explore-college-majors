Here's a rundown of the three films:

AMERICAN PSYCHO

""American Psycho"" (2000) didn't look like a promising film for me. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of ""Deathwish."" In ""Deathwish"" a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in ""American Psycho"" a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.

I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).

So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.

I also got the joke. ""American Psycho"" is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).

Thankfully, ""American Psycho"" has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera. ***SPOILER ALERT*** And then the final act strongly hints that none of the murders are real; it's all in his mind and he's going deeper into insanity. ***END SPOILDER***

I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but ""American Psycho"" has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.

This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.

THE WAY OF THE GUN

On the surface ""The Way of the Gun"" (2000) looks like a good, offbeat flick. It was written & directed by a proven writer and features a quality cast. In addition, the film is touted as a ""modern Western"" with two protagonists (term used loosely) patterned after Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (their names in the film were the last names of Butch & Sundance).

THE PLOT: Two low-life criminals kidnap a pregnant surrogate of a rich couple who, unknowingly, has ties to the mob.

The film starts out as a comedy with cussing every other word and then morphs into a serious crime thriller-drama. The score is likably offbeat.

Two problems hold the film back: (1.) A plot that becomes ridiculously convoluted and therefore increasingly unbelievable, and (2.) unlikable characters, except for maybe the surrogate. Concerning the second fault, I understand the concept of antiheroes, but even antiheroes have to have some redeemable or universally human qualities to make the audience root for them or care about them.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B001GCUO1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;and Clint Eastwood's Western characters, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Outlaw-Josey-Wales/dp/B003ASLJRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a>, are good examples, as are the antiheroes in films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runaway-Train/dp/0792838424/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runaway Train</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/6305609705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>,"" two cinematic masterpieces. These two problems combined naturally create disinterest. By the 90 minute mark, with only a half hour to go, I couldn't care less about the characters, their story or how it turned out, even though I really tried.

To the film's credit, it has style and surprising glimpses of depth, but the absurdly convoluted screenplay and unlikable characters sink ""The Way of the Gun.""

The film was shot in Utah.

REQUIEM FOR A DREAM

I didn't discover Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) until after discovering its great score. We've all heard this powerful score somewhere over the last dozen years or so since it's been cut & pasted ad infinitum, but I wasn't aware of its name or what film it was originally derived. I finally tracked it down to ""Requiem for a Dream."" The reason it was hard to uncover is because the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, likely due to its NC-17 rating, even though it's generally regarded as a near masterpiece, albeit in the downbeat sense.

""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about substance addiction, legal or illegal. The film stars Ellen Burstyn as a Brooklyn widow who has to deal with her addict son (Jared Leto), whom she loves too much to render the necessary ""tough love."" Jennifer Connelly plays the son's girlfriend and Marlon Waylans his best friend, both equally addicted.

The film utilizes various creative picture/editing techniques to relay its tale of a slow descent into hell on earth. The characters are understandably kind of pathetic and the story is only moderately absorbing, until the end, that is. The climax is a powerful indictment of drug abuse, legal or illegal. So potent, in fact, that I literally wept (!).

The NC-17 rating mainly has to do with a shocking climatic scene involving Connelly's character at some stag party, but there's an R-rated version that relays all the information you need to know. I've seen both and, although I prefer uncensored films, the edited version is worthy. Besides, the cut scene is available on youtube for anyone who's interested.

BOTTOM LINE: While the story is only mildly absorbing it has great acting and is filled with kinetic filmmaking, which is both interesting and sometimes annoying. But the ending is pummeling in a horrifying sense, and the score is a veritable masterpiece. However, the film's unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse keeps it from being entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.",1349568000,,6959,5.506566604127579
