7928373,1,B00004ZBP4,"Oh my god this was so bad, I am the queen of the slasher films I probably have more movies than Blockbuster, I even own a copy of the Brain that Wouldn't Die(with Elvira Mistress of the Dark as the host) in black and white it cost me .99 cents at the Dollar Store, but this movie Wow this was just throwing out money bad all around. the acting, the special effects, there's a scene where the scarecrow chases a girl through the cornfield she falls he lifts his ax and hits her on the face, close up of her face and you can see that it's a plastic doll's face. Usually with these movies the chessier the better not here though this was just pathetic and the end  was too stupid even for this type of movie.",1090800000,,705,4.108695652173913
7928374,3,B00004ZBP4,"Psycho Scarecrow is about a nerd who is accidentally killed by one of his friends. To hide their crime, the gang stuffs his body in an old scarecrow somewhere out in the cornfield. It isn't long before ancient tribal magic brings the nerd back to life for a little revenge. Psycho Scarecrow is not exactly perfect, but it is entertaining and satisfying. In today's market where most horror films are pure garbage, psycho Scarecrow is one film that surpasses expectations.",1049068800,,471,4.9
