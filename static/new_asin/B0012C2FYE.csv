8245014,2,B0012C2FYE,"Forget any thoughts you may have had on seeing the front cover or title of this film. Dont be fooled by the hunk presented at the cover, he never appears. At maximum, the start of the film is about a guy that cleans houses in his underwear. Punkt. The rest of the plot is somewhat confusing, and certainly not well developed. As its been stated in other reviews, there is a lousy plan of transforming gay men into heterosexuals, using for this asponge! And helped by a priest, the main character wants to stop this, meanwhile regaining the love of his life.
Its poorly acted, poorly developed, poorly presented. I just gave it two stars because of some gay films Ive watched, that doesnt deserve one! One point in favor, at least for me, I have for the film. The actors presented are fairly handsome, but hot expetacular. They are regular guys. Had they acted better",1479081600,,866,4.5576923076923075

8245016,3,B0012C2FYE,"this review goes out under the name of my life-partner, bruce, but is written by dennis milam-and not bruce! as another reviewer comments, joe schenck(in the lead role) stands out as the best thing about this film. he is very good and obviously talented. he manages to play 3 different versions of himself. the scene at the end in the coffeeshop and afterwards is a good illustration of his abilities. he is handsome, but it was refreshing to see a gay mens' film with guys who look like ""regular gay guys""- good-looking but not the usual gym-bunny stereotype.they're the kind of guys i'd want to marry(if i wasn't already!) mr.schenck,whom i'd never seen before, has a presence when on-film. the film itself is sweet and fun but no cinematic classic by any means and could have used better editing and tightening. however, it is worth watching.",1210550400,2,845,4.794520547945205
8245017,2,B0012C2FYE,"It sounded like it had potential as a comedy:  a single gay man works for one of those big city services that sends guys out to clean your apartment wearing just their underwear.  That potential is wasted big time by this film's FOUR (believe it or not!) different gay, who apparently had completely different visions of what the film was supposed to be about ... and it shows. It's part satire about religious ex-gay movements, part romantic comedy, part parody of ""Sleeping Beauty"", part sci-fi fantasy about haunted sponges (I kid you not), and an incredibly long 95 minutes of boredom.

The film tells the story of said underwear-clad gay housecleaner, Moses, who apparently has seizures during which he has a religious ""visitation"" from the goddess Glintentica. But when Moses finds meets David, the man of his dreams, Glintentica plots to take over David's soul, with the eventual goal of wiping out the entire gay population (Are we laughing yet?) Moses plots with his roommate, Ruth, to twart Glintentica's evil plans. Ho, hum.

By the way, if you are thinking of getting the film because of the hunky guy on the front of the DVD case, don't, because there is no such person/scene in the film. To me that's a sure sign that the releasing company realized they had a dud on their hands, and thought the ""eye candy"" would at least get them a few sales from people who would buy it only based on the cover art.

I've given decent ratings to some pretty awful films, if they were at least fun on some level, but I don't see anything to like here. Giving it two stars out of five seems generous to me.",1209600000,,1604,4.594405594405594
8245018,1,B0012C2FYE,"This just might rank among the worst movies ever made. ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" begins to look like Oscar material by comparison.
With the exception of the lead, Joe Schenck,cute and likable, the acting is cringe inducing.
The script is silly ,sophomoric and so confusing that the viewer never quite knows what is going on which naturally leads to not caring about knowing what is going on. My BF and I finally pulled the plug about three quarters of the way through. I guess we'll never know how it turns out not that we'll ever give that a second thought.
Save your money, don't buy this dreck. What were these queens thinking? or more accurately, not.",1205712000,4,658,4.632478632478633
