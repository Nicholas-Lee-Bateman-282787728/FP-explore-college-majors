7945278,1,B00005MEYG,"Overripe drama about a kidnapping and a Southern family's dirty secrets. The film's story is set in the present, however it plays like something out of the 40s or 50s. The hammy acting and stagy dialogue only add to this effect, which according to the director was intentional, but it just doesn't work.  The transfer is marginal, the picture is very fuzzy, and it's in pan & scan format, making the obviously widescreen shots (in the super 16 format) look claustrophobic.",1017014400,2,472,4.827160493827161
7945279,5,B00005MEYG,"I found this film to be intense and riveting.  It held my attention completely.  I found the characters to be well defined and and the directing quite creative.  The subject is daring and difficult to watch, but important.  I would imagine therapists today deal/ people in denial,however when the the therapist is in denial, it is a lost cause.  Great insight on the part of Mr. Rosenberg.",1010534400,,389,4.746268656716418
7945280,5,B00005MEYG,"This is one of the most exciting, emotional, and thought-provoking independent films I've ever seen.  The story is filled with psychological twists and turns, and the performances are great.  The lead actor, Mark Withers, is especially good. His performance is powerful and presents a deep and complex character study.  I was in tears by the end of the movie.  This is one movie I definately will tell my friends to buy.  This film should be in every film buff's library.",1000080000,4,471,4.8375
7945281,4,B00005MEYG,"What got me most about SOUTHERN MAN is it doesn't hit you over the head with a message. What it does hit you with is it's quiet intensity. The performances are top rate, and in this era of over blown production value, it's nice to see a film that is both story and character driven. Let's see more films like SOUTHERN MAN. Better yet, let's see more films by the talented, Rick Rosenberg.",998352000,,388,4.328767123287672
7945282,5,B00005MEYG,"I heard about this indie at a film festival.  A bunch of studio people were talking about it.  Pretty *&?/@3% cool.  That's all I can say.  The opening's intense.  And the story kept me hooked, trying to figure out what's up throughout.  Killer ending as well.  Does anybody know if this Rosenberg guy has written or directed anything else?  Occassionally somebody comes along, like a Sayles or a Tarrantino, where you just go, whatever this guy has done, or is doing, I want to see it.  From his writing, I get the sense he's spent some time in jail.",997660800,,551,4.484848484848484
