3597085,5,B001G6E7QK,Great movie!!! the kids love it and we watch it all the time.  The Furious Five is entertaining too!,1228176000,,100,4.2631578947368425
3597086,4,B001G6E7QK,"I've got no issues with the feature film; it was just as good when I saw it in the theatres twice.  But the Furious Five add-on is just a waste of time and money.  It is about 30 minutes of backstory on the Furious Five as it explains how they came to study under Master Shifu.  There are also some live-action demonstrations of their various fighting styles and a test to discover which kung fu style you are, but all in all it's just a waste.  Get the movie only, save your money.",1226793600,24,482,4.150537634408602
3597087,1,B001G6E7QK,Love the movie but they didn't offer the double disc of it at the time I ordered it with the disc of the Furious Five. I feel cheated,1226534400,5,133,3.7857142857142856
3597088,5,B001G6E7QK,"I have grown to love CGI when it is used in animated films. Kung Fu Panda is no exception. Jack Black seems to have found a perfect medium for his zany energy and style....he is perfectly cast as Po the Panda. The animation is superb in this martial arts based animated tale and the Asian setting is serene and beautiful. Kids and adults will enjoy this funny hip animated feature. The DVD has a great transfer and a fair amount of extras, including a direct to video sequel in this two pack DVD set.",1226102400,5,500,4.329787234042553
3597089,5,B001G6E7QK,"awesome movie, one of my favorite.  i ve seen it at least 4 times.
but how come its dvd version comes so late. it takes too long time.",1225238400,,134,3.7857142857142856
3597090,5,B001G6E7QK,"This was a really cool animation. I have rated it based on the original movie, but I would like to know why the sequal is not offered in the blu ray version.  That is the version I was going to buy but not it seems that I might not.  I would like to have both the movie and the sequel and the sequel is not offered in the blu ray version.  I refuse to pay twice for the same movie just to have the sequel. This really sucks.

3597091,5,B001G6E7QK,It was brand new as stated and received very quickly.  This is one of the funniest movies.  The animation and characters are top notch.,1356220800,,135,4.583333333333333
3597092,4,B001G6E7QK,Good story well made technically. Funny most of the time with some underlying message - if you really want you can achieve anything - without a raised forefinger. I enjoyed the movie again viewing it a second time two months apart.,1316649600,,231,4.658536585365853
3597093,4,B001G6E7QK,kung fu panda-animation superb...the furious five-alittle abit disappointing animation completely different starts of as ok but at the end of the day its for the kids...my kids enjoyed kung fu panda more and lost interest wth the furious five and haven't watched it again...each to their own could be superb to someone else..,1303516800,,325,5.150943396226415
3597094,4,B001G6E7QK,"Kung Fu Panda is one of our favorite family movies....
... the furious five .. not so much. It wasn't much of a bonus.
The kids and I were disappointed.",1294358400,,152,4.1
3597095,5,B001G6E7QK,This movie I bought for my son he loved it so much it came on time and he was able to watch it I was happy this movie was very good thanks,1259020800,,138,3.34375
3597096,5,B001G6E7QK,"This is a fun movie to watch with my family and friends.  As is the trend with many recent animated movies, it is made for adults and children to enjoy--but the ""adult"" content is not so far flung that the kids are sitting there with blank faces wondering why the parents are laughing.  Of course, there are scenes that we skip that are just too ""violent"" for the 2 year old.",1239235200,,375,4.267605633802817
3597097,5,B001G6E7QK,"This is the best movie of 2008!

View Kung Fu Panda with your spirit open.
Kung Fu Panda is fun,informative,entertaining,
and spiritual.",1235174400,,145,5.3478260869565215
3597099,5,B001G6E7QK,"Due to the movies, my 7 year old wants to take Kung-Fu and we even bought her chopsticks since there is a tutorial on eating with chopsticks in the special features.  We watch both of these movies frequently.",1235088000,,208,4.473684210526316
3597100,5,B001G6E7QK,"very good DVDs, the second one was shorter than i'd expected but over all very good.",1234224000,,84,4.3125
3597101,5,B001G6E7QK,"For kung fu panda-
This movie is great. The story is told in a very innovative way, is fluid and full of action. the extras are good, very good. the film comes in english, spanish and french

For the secrets of the furious five-
Is the excellent complement to kung fu panda. the extras are great too. The main film is really good, even though is not as good as kung fu panda film.",1234051200,,380,4.135135135135135
3597102,5,B001G6E7QK,Good price good service.  My grand daughter got a big kick out of Kung Foo Panda.  Haven't watched the second DVD yet but I'm sure it'll be fine.,1233705600,,145,4.142857142857143
3597103,5,B001G6E7QK,"I was lucky enough to go to an event sponsored by Dreamworks to watch this film. I of course loved the film, I think it is imaginative, fun, well put together and have so many lessons to teach. When the film came out on DVD, I got it with the Secrets of the Furious Five. I loved the back ground information about the five, as well as all the games. However, it's not a full-length film, more of an add-on DVD, if anyone had any illusions otherwise. I would recommend this, though, if you like add-ons. A lot is targeting children, but there are fun stuff for adults too :)",1233705600,,573,4.218181818181818
3597104,5,B001G6E7QK,My daughter and I love to watch this movie together.  It's a good movie and the bonus DVD gets quit a bit of play also.,1232409600,,119,3.76
3597105,5,B001G6E7QK,Great fun!! The story is beautiful. Animation is top notch. Talent is top notch. I only wish it came with a Digital Copy so I could carry it around on my iPhone 3G & watch it again and again wherever I am. I think more movies should include a Digital Copy...great feature. I highly recommend picking this up...you will NOT be disappointed!!,1232323200,,340,4.5
3597106,5,B001G6E7QK,"This was a treat from beginning to end! Every character was amazingly ""drawn"" and very well cast! Jack Black as ""Po"", a chubby panda who wants to be a kung fu master, was sheer genius. Each celebrity voice perfectly fit the animal they were portraying. The story was extremely well written and sends a great message to kids and adults alike: Believe in yourself and great thing can happen to you and those around you.",1232236800,,417,4.573333333333333
3597107,5,B001G6E7QK,This is a great combination.  My five year old son loved both of these movies.  He loved the Furious Five just as much as Kung Fu Panda.  If you have small children I highly recommend this deal.,1232236800,,194,4.1891891891891895
3597108,5,B001G6E7QK,"Although we just bought the standard def DVD, the colors and picture are just as stunning as they were on the IMAX screen last year.  It's a gorgeous film.  The message of the film is pretty good, too.  There is some magic in the film, but most of the message is to ignore magic and work hard to achieve your goals.",1231891200,,315,4.131147540983607
3597109,5,B001G6E7QK,Really cool dvd for everyone to share.  Interviews with the movie stars who did the voices for the characters was alot of fun to watch. It's a keeper!! Great gift for anyone on that Special Day!,1231804800,,194,4.388888888888889
3597110,5,B001G6E7QK,"This is one of the best movies put out in a long time.  Clean, funny, and lots of laughs for any age (and I'm 50). It's a great one for the home library collection.",1231632000,,164,3.823529411764706
3597111,5,B001G6E7QK,"As a harsh movie critic, I expected this movie to be full of stupid humor with a ridiculous story line. I was pleasantly surprised, and laughed all the way through. My niece and nephews (Age 2 and 5) love it. Even their dads were laughing. There's a good lesson, and this movie is all around well written, scripted, acted, animated and artistic.",1231632000,2,345,4.580645161290323
3597112,5,B001G6E7QK,"This movie was so good, I laughed through the entire viewing. My son and I enjoyed it together on New Years. And I didn't have to be concerned about the adult content or sexual innuendo that plagues some certain animation such as the Shrek series.",1231286400,,247,4.511111111111111
3597113,5,B001G6E7QK,I bought this for a stocking stuffer for my son who is 5 and he was so excited to have gotten it.  Not only did he see the movie in the theaters but he loves the fact that the Furious Five came with it.  My 1 year old loves to watch the movie as well.  Highly recommend this....,1231286400,,278,3.7586206896551726
3597114,5,B001G6E7QK,Great DVDs! I am a Kung Fu student. I have offered these to my shifu to use for his younger students. Just an excellent pair to have.,1231200000,,133,3.962962962962963
3597115,5,B001G6E7QK,This movie duo was a great find! The movie is very funny and the price was the best I could find.,1231200000,,97,3.6666666666666665
3597116,5,B001G6E7QK,"I'd forgotten that whether or not both dvd's were included in this order, so when my son started telling people that he'd asked for both, I got worried because I saw Kung Fu Panda sold all by itself in all of the retail stores.  When I was finally able to wrap the gifts, I was so thrilled that both of the movies were included - whew!",1231200000,,335,4.075757575757576
3597117,2,B001G6E7QK,"This just is not a grow up aminated movie and has little to offer in plot or story.  But your kids will love it!  My two watched it three times Chirstmas day after they got it from Santa and would have watched it a fourth, but three times was plenty!!!",1231200000,,252,4.02
3597118,3,B001G6E7QK,"The DVDs themselves were in excellent condition. Not even a smudge or a fingerprint. I was impressed with that. I was not impressed with the DVD cases. There were big bubbles in the plastic. Normally that wouldn't bother me so much, but these were supposed to be a Christmas gift for my niece. I just wish the seller had been more specific with product decription. Other than that they arrived on time. Everything was great.",1230681600,,424,4.666666666666667
3597119,4,B001G6E7QK,"My son loved this movie and couldn't wait to get it on DVD. The characters are appealing, the action and sound effects are great. There is a beautiful clarity to the animation. He wanted to get the 2 pack and I'm glad I got it at the lower price on Amazon - the additional DVD is a different standard / style of animation and short if you pay full price for the set.",1230422400,,366,4.027397260273973
3597120,4,B001G6E7QK,"Since we have no network or Cable t.v. I had missed any hype about this movie, aside from the preview I saw at a theater. It caught my eye, and I thought it might be worth watching. Never saw it in a theater, but when Amazon ran a special offer on it, with ""Furious Five"" thrown in, I couldn't resist. It was a bargain!
It arrived safely and quickly. We watched it a day or two later, and were most pleased with the movie. It was far better than I was expecting. I was more than a little leery of Jack Black's out of control adult manic nature, but it seems that he was kept at a moderated and family level. :)
I only gave it 4 stars because it suffered from some of the sentimental weaknesses we have come to expect from Disney. Even though this is a Dreamworks project. :)
The opening sequence, a dream of the Panda, in which he is a great Kung Fu warrior fighting evil hordes, hooked me immediately. It was a departure from what I was expecting, and it was rendered in fantastic style!!! From that moment I was sold.
The rest of the movie was great, and Dustin Hoffman (The master) was a surprise, and did an excellent job!!
The hand to hand combat was terrific. Fast paced and executed very well...Maybe I'll change my rating to 5 stars. ;)
If you are on the fence about this item, I would say go ahead and get it. I did, and I was most pleased with my decision.
It's great entertainment for kids, and kids at heart, and people who like animation...",1230336000,,1453,4.211469534050179
3597121,3,B001G6E7QK,"I agree with all the other reviewers who said that this two-pack deal was not value for money. The feature movie was great! Ever since my nephews and nieces got it, they watch it twice a day! I would too if I could! They can now recite the lines along with the characters. So the 3-stars is for this DVD package. Frankly, the secrets of the Furious Five should just have been a DVD extra not packaged like we were getting another feature film. And the rest of the extras, while informative and even clever, was not so entertaining. Perhaps the main feature set the standard too high. Trying too hard to squeeze a few more bucks from the audience! But if you wanna know if you should get the movie (single pack/disc)? Yes! 5 stars for King Fu Panda. Hopes it wins an Oscar! It should win. The only other contender for best animation would be Wall. E",1230163200,,848,4.339622641509434
3597122,4,B001G6E7QK,"I thought this was a fun movie for the whole family and, in addition, shows a great message that you can do just about anything if you really believe in yourself and work hard.",1230076800,,176,4.205882352941177
3597123,1,B001G6E7QK,"My rating has nothing to do with the actual movie itself -- it was the quality of the new DVD I received from Amazon as a gift for my grandson on Thanksgiving.  I purchased the two-pack set and I was upset when grandson told me ""Kung Fu Panda"" DVD did not work, although the ""Furious Five"" did work.  So I had to retrieve the set from him and return it to you.  However, I was impressed at how fast you sent me a replacement.  I'm hopeful that the replacement is not defective -- my grandson has not had a chance to view them yet.",1229385600,,530,4.0673076923076925

Great DVD for entire family.",1229040000,,318,11.72
3597125,3,B001G6E7QK,"I would not spend the extra money for the added DVD. It's only about a half hour at most and is not wort even seeing. It's cute for kids, but my son would rather watch Kungfu Panda above the Furious 5 any day. It got one use and i suspect it will sit in the back of our dvd shelf until we sell it at a garage sale. BUT kungfu panda is SO cute and it's hilarious seeing the kids get so excited about it.",1229040000,,402,3.7411764705882353
3597126,4,B001G6E7QK,I heard from my son how he really liked the Kung Fu Panda.  We usually only buy animated movies for our Grandchildren.  This time we decided to but it for ourselves and just say it is for the grandchildren when they come to visit.  We really like the characters and the humor.  This goes to show you are never too old for animated fun.,1229040000,,335,4.1875
3597127,5,B001G6E7QK,Kung Fu Panda is a fantastic movie!  The comedy is clean and rice in content!  My kids absolutely loved it.  This is one to own.....,1229040000,,132,4.2
3597128,3,B001G6E7QK,"While the content is a nice collection of material on both discs, all of which aimed primarily at kids, it begs the question as to why this bundle was not made into a two-disc DVD special edition.  There is not enough content on the second disc to warrent it being sold as a separate item, as implied by the trailer for Secrets of the Furious Five that runs in front of the Kung Fu Panda DVD.  It is almost teasing people who didn't buy this version and bought the movie by itself.

As far as the actual content, it is a nice and very complete set of material that will keep the young ones occupited for several hours as they go through each of the special features.  Animation fans will love the 2-D ""sequel"" just as much as they love the main feature.  And once you know the backstory to the Furious Five, they become that much more appealing as characters.",1229040000,,859,4.3105590062111805

I immediately notified the seller, who responded, apologized and promised to resend another one as soon as I returned thegame. I did exactly that immediatel and have not heard from her since then.
