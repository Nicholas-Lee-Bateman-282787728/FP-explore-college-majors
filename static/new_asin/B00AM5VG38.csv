8553532,3,B00AM5VG38,"This movie is a great sequel and is very similar to the first one.

A lot vengeance and murder in the Yakuza over fear and trust.

It's a bit hard to follow because so many characters get introduced and killed so fast.

Seems like it should've been prolonged in a TV series.

According to Wikipedia, there were 0 homicides using a gun in Japan in 2008.
How close is this movie to reality of the Yakuza group?",1378598400,,408,4.259740259740259
8553533,5,B00AM5VG38,"""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano's latest, ""Outrage Beyond"", a sequel to 2010's Yakuza thriller ""Outrage"" delivers the goods better than any Kitano film since ""Zatoichi."" I won't get into the plot or the characters too much, you really need to see these two films in order with as little knowledge as possible to enhance your enjoyment to the maximum.

If you are addicted to the American-style of vapid, meaningless shoot-em-up gangster films, then this film isn't for you.

But if you are a connoisseur of the perfect meshing of art and entertainment and violence (with a not-so-subtle message about declining tradition and the changes in (gangster) society that this results in), and if you are a Kitano fan, get ready for a thrill ride that you'll hope won't end.

A thumbnail of the features that make this film an undeniable Kitano classic follows below. (Like the finest chocolate cake, this film is meant to be SAVORED, minute-by-minute, rather than devoured like, oh, say, Tarantino's over-the-top cartoon-like-violence flicks).

1. The characters - they are absolutely dead-on, the acting is excellent and there are a number of supporting characters not central to the action (two mob underbosses) who are so enjoyable to watch that they practically steal every scene they are in. This is character acting at it absolute finest. Like all of Kitano's serious films, (and Japanese films in general from my experience), there is a rich STORY here and myriad plots and sub-plots that have to be carefully followed to fully understand what is happening. A movie that engages your mind - what a concept! Once you get to know the characters - the empty suits, the curmudgeonly wisemen, the self-deluding fools, and the absolutely execrably vile schemers and assassins, then it is time to get the show really started.

2. The violence - like all of Kitano's films, the violence is understated but MUCH more personal than in a Tarantino shoot-em-up. When someone gets shot or stabbed in a Kitano film, YOU squirm with discomfort, which is exactly what Kitano wants you to do. He makes you FEEL the violence. (Remember the scene in ""Violent Cop"" where Takeshi takes an assassin's knife away from him by grabbing the blade - only to have to slowly extract it from his heavily bleeding, seemingly paralyzed clenched fist after making his getaway?) As a bonus, there are two new ways that Kitano devises to get rid of particularly traitorous, odious stooges that are both shocking and laugh-out-loud-hilarious at the same time. You'll have to see the film and I guarantee you won't have to wonder which scenes I am talking about.

3. The ending. To me, this film has the hands-down best, most satisfying, ending of any Kitano film. It is a surprise ending, much like the ending of ""Violent Cop"" was unexpected. Except that in this case it will make you jump on your couch and pump your fist into the air as you yell ""Yeah! YEAAAHHHH!!!"" I promise you, it will not disappoint.

After seeing this artistic, almost-Shakespearean Yakuza ""film noir"" masterpiece, you'll be clamoring for Takeshi to make the final film of the rumored trilogy, so that you and your friends can all get together in a few years in front of a 70-inch flat screen HD TV and have a back-to-back-to-back ""Outrage Film Festival"" of your own.",1377734400,,3296,4.906642728904847
