7929894,2,B0000524EA,"I have already reviewed this once.  I didn't like the film, because it is basically just the evil antics of an amoral chick.  It actually had nothing to do about sorority life or workings at all.  The ""star"" just basically walks in and takes over.  Was she a pledge?  Was she a member from another school?
  I must firmly state, my opinion of the DVD has NOTHING at all to do with the seller.  The DVD came on time and was packaged well.  The DVD is a remake of an earlier film.  I might have been better off getting the original.",1464048000,,530,4.158415841584159

I like a lot of this movie, especially the character of Sabrina! Man, I
want to own a 1958 Corvette now!

It's really too bad there are no extra features on the DVD, I don't own
it but that's what I've heard. I would have really looked forward to a
director's cut or bloopers, deleted scenes, interviews, film locations
be disclosed.

The movie had some big flaws, one of which is that we know nothing
about Sabrina's history and just how bad of a girl she had been in the
past (and how she came about getting that fantastic car). Makes me want
to watch a Prequel, or Sequel (after jailtime, is she reformed?).

I have to keep in mind that it was a made-for-TV movie, and I am glad
this movie exists, despite it's imperfections. The character of Rita
Summers, Mort's GF, wasn't very strong and didn't fight back against
Sabrina's aggressiveness. That was disappointing.

Maybe if it were a TV mini-series it would have been better. Then again maybe not. A full blown TV series, yes.

I feel as though the only good acting in the movie was done by the
actors of Sabrina and Mort. Also Sabrina's mother was pretty good
although brief. If you notice, the actor of her mother played a
Starfleet Admiral in Star Trek: TNG.

After watching the movie, I'm glad I watched it but at the same time I
am angry that the audience was left hanging without closure. Sabrina is
clearly going to be different now, hopefully she will reform and be not
such a bad girl anymore and finally get a college degree and be a
mother. Maybe I should mail Jamie Luner and ask if she'd want to do a
Sequel!",1336521600,,1598,4.414965986394558

7929900,5,B0000524EA,This movie has a great storyline with well developed characters. Alyssa is great in this movie. This is one of her best roles yet. Jamie Luner is also very convincing as the very nasty Sabrina. Great movie. I could watch it a million times in a row without getting bored. Alyssa is a great actress and this is a great movie for any Alyssa fan. (Alyssa is not the star though) I would recomend this to anybody.,983577600,3,409,4.324675324675325
