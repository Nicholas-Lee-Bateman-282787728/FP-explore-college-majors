6112490,5,B00GTZWZH6,"I'm not sure how anyone can rate these episodes or this last season already,  since these episodes haven't even been broadcast yet, but I have high hopes for this last season of what has been to me a fun and entertaining show. I am disappointed that Syfy decided to cancel yet another excellent show, most likely to be replaced with more of their WWF or reality drivel, but I am looking forward to this fifth season of Warehouse 13. I'm sure they will go out in style.",1390176000,73,468,4.379310344827586
6112491,1,B00GTZWZH6,"Hopefully the price on this ""SEASON"" #5 shall drop due to the season c/o only six (6) episodes to wrap-up series. SY-FY shot themselves in foot with this cancellation!",1388966400,34,167,4.793103448275862

6112495,5,B00GTZWZH6,"Warehouse 13 is one of my favorite sci-fi series; it's a great combination of comedy, drama, action, and some very novel ideas. Imagine that objects can have powers: Brushing your hair with Marilyn Monroe's hairbrush will turn your hair color to platinum blonde; W.C. Fields' juggling balls will make you drunk...
Great cast, fascinating plot lines with surprising twists, and well done character growth make this a ""must own"" series. I have bought all five seasons, and my wife and I sat down and watched them all from season 1 to the last episode.",1505088000,,549,4.851063829787234

6112580,3,B00GTZWZH6,"I'm a little disappointed. I think the story line could have been better bringing Pete & Myka together. I didn't like or thought it was believable that Jinxy didn't think he was worthy enough to have memories. It's not every day that you die and come back to life. Artie's son?!?!? That was totally unbelievable. I did like, and it made me cry, when Artie had the heart to heart with the Warehouse & the Warehouse rolling an apple to him. I think that was the most believable and fitting part that made any kind of sense in wrapping up Warehouse 13. In regards to Claudia, it only made sense that she would take the place of Mrs Frederic. I did not like where Claudia first wanted it then she didn't. It wasn't believable to me because it was obvious where the story was going. I thought how she portrayed herself after taking over was stupid. Where did her new voice come from???",1465344000,,880,4.404907975460123

6112642,3,B00GTZWZH6,"Loved the series, and yes, I prefer that they end the show while it's going well than wait until it's run into the ground to cancel it, but Season Five feels rushed to reach a conclusion.  Essentially a ""half season"" worth of shows that throws a couple of left hooks that makes you think, ""If this is so, why did they do X in Season Y?""  It would have been nice if SyFy gave the show a full season to wrap things up in a way that felt more natural.",1449532800,,448,3.966666666666667

It was the type of show you could just put on and not worry about it being too scary, too bloody, too psychological, etc., but still retained that sense of mystery and weirdness we like.  Kind of a mild version of X-files meets Indiana Jones.  It was very witty (my kind of dark humor too) and the characters really grew as the show progressed.

6112858,5,B00GTZWZH6,"I'm really sad to see such a wonderful show coming to an end. It's so frustrating when you can find a show you love to watch and it gets up and cancelled. I hope they see the error of their ways and either re-instate the show or do some sort of spin off using the characters we all know and love.
This show has an excellent cast ensemble. They are funny, intelligent, quirky, and are all relatable. They work so well together, and draw you into their world. I also love the use of History and Literary references used in the show.
It is such a bummer to see such a wonderful show leave us yet again, to probably be replaced by another reality show. Those are the shows that the tv execs need to be removing from tv. Isn't the whole point of tv to get to escape reality for an hour, and be carried off into fantasy. I hope that the powers that be hear our pleas and find a way to bring Warehouse 13 back, even if in a new way!!!",1430870400,,927,4.043478260869565

I probably don't qualify as an agent, but it would be so much fun, and I would probably bring the world to the edge of disaster on a regular basis. I thought each season worked well as an arc for the story, and that the final epsode wrapped up the loose ends in ways that were satisfying..unlike many of the other shows I have watched.

I am glad that someone outthere in TV land understands good characters, an ensemble cast and fun stories. If you have not watched this, and you like adventure, humor, gadgets and conspiracy theories, I envy you as you have it still ahead of you to watch.",1423353600,,625,4.296610169491525

6113309,5,B00GTZWZH6,"The first 2 seasons were great.  The 3rd started to get a little strange, but workable.  By the 4th season, it seemed like they were starting to reach in a direction they didn't have to go.  They could have continued for a couple more seasons entertaining more of the myths about history before getting all kooky.

The last closing season sucked, introduced things that were never mentioned during the other seasons and also had a couple of the extremely limited episodes dive into unnecessary directions (Spanish soap opera?? Really???).

All in all...I loved the show.  Thanks for at least getting a chance to end it with some sort of proper ending.

6113321,5,B00GTZWZH6,"I have to say I really love this show. I started out not really knowing what to think, especially for a sci-fi mini-series, but it took my imagination and ended up being one of the greatest sci fi shows I've seen in a long time.

The main male lead is pretty obnoxious, being one of those man child things that seem to be so common in tv and movies these days, and unfortunately also in real life. The other main character is a female that I also have a hard time standing. She's got this obnoxious propensity to look like a puppy dog getting a good pet from someone whenever they give her a compliment or even so much as act like a normal human being towards her.

You might be asking yourself with this incredible lineup of main characters why I am rating it a 5 stars. This comes from the fact that the supporting characters are brilliant, a psychotic and brilliant computer hacker, and a scrooge type of old man that hates newfangled technology.

The thing that really makes this show work is the idea behind it. If you've watched any of the librarian movies, then you'll know the basic story. a secret agency that protects artifacts with magical abilities. But they don't get too weighed down in confusing storylines. So it's mostly just a show exploring really interesting objects created by famous people throughout history.

I rarely find television that interesting but this show and Eureka have changed my opinion of what the Syfy channel could create. I hope that a new Warehouse 14 or some other version of this show will reappear when executives realize that reality shows fade in ratings and creativity are what make this channel different. Lose the ghost hunters, reality stuff and anime and bring back shows with staying power.

 Thank you for at least giving the show the dignity of a wrap up. Thank you to a fantastic cast of actors, writers and producers who have given us years of entertainment and a desire to explore mysteries of the past and future.",1415318400,,708,4.648

I enjoyed season five, though the stories weren't that great, and the fact that there were only six episodes in the entire season was quite disappointing.  The finale was so-so and could have been much better, though it did seem left open to the possibility of continuation at some point.

I managed to watch all 5 seasons within a couple of weeks or less. I very much so grew to love the characters and the family atmosphere that was present on the show. I already got that nostalgia feeling.

I wish it would have lasted longer. I feel like they could have and would have but i suspect it was the not of to the cast or crew but higher up the sci-fy channel food chain. Shame. There could have been so many more awesome adventures and character development scenarios of the warehouse 13 family.

It was Science Fiction it was Drama, it was Comedy all rolled into one. It made you care for Artie, Pete, Myca and Claudia they were our friends they were our family. In days past good TV series would go 15 or more seasons these days if you get 5 you are considered a hit.

I was sad to find out that this was going to be the last season of one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Having said that, the final season was almost spectacular. There were a couple of *interesting* episodes, yet I suppose it was time. The fourth season seemed to have been written with the show's demise in mind, and the series ended well.

I would recommend the entire series to any viewer that enjoys cop shows. It goes to the next level with mystery, intrigue on several levels, and slapstick hilarity that keeps it from getting too deep.

Now, go get it!",1411344000,,588,4.288288288288288

I didn't mind the fee, tho it would have been great to see it free, but I was anxious and didn't want to wait. This series is so good--elements of ALL genres like science fiction, detective stories, comedy etc. The actors worked together like clock work. The stories were new and innovative. Be sure to try it.

I object to Sy-Fy NOT making this Hulu available for the first time in five seasons so I will watch it on Netflix or buy it when the DVD set is down to $9.95 and no one gets anymore residuals or royalties because I'm ticked at all the pay per view hogs out there who have started hold back (Including Cover Affairs) and Keys to Open.  I think CABLE runners need to realize in an era of Hulu +, Amazon Prime and Netflix paying $120 a month to get 300 channels and NO MUSIC VIDEOS on MTV has become a burn out.  I speak for all the OLD GUYS here when I say that back in 1980 when there was NOTHING on Showtime, HBO, WOR, WGN or Turner you put on MTV and were entertained for hours with Duran Duran and others.  Today you go to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime where, collectively for $26 you get your choice of entertainment ON DEMAND and if it is a re-run it's by CHOICE and not some programmer's infliction!  So there you have it.  You can pay $120 to get Time Warner or some other cable guy, you can get the dish and hope it doesn't rain or you can by into STREAM ON DEMAND for under $30!!!

6113709,4,B00GTZWZH6,"This covers all five seasons. I am not one to start new shows. I find myself getting upset with where the writers take the characters. Grimm and Warehouse 13 fell into this category of not tweaking my interest. I am an Amazon Prime member. The membership allowed me to begin watching Grimm for free as part of my membership. I am now a solid fan. The same applied to Warehouse 13. When I first saw the promos they did nothing for me. Since most of the shows I view are off for the season I went in search of something to watch. I found Warehouse 13 and since I could view some episodes for free, I tried it. Just like Grimm, I was hooked. It is filled with humor and the building of friendships between a select number of individuals.
The reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the writers, as writers are won't to do, get off track. Even with this, I am in my second viewing.
What I did find to be most enjoyable was that the drivers of the production brought it to a fantastic conclusion, i.e., they did not leave you handing as to what happened to the characters.
I did like HG Wells.

Bonus:  I strongly recommend Secret Santa - Season 2 - It is both hilarious and poignant.",1406764800,,1184,4.211453744493392

My wife and I had watched the previous 4 series', so couldn't miss this wrap up despite the short length. (6 episodes and a ""bonus"" episode which was actualy included previously in an earlier series.)
This little trick seems to be a common one with many production companies when they cancel a show and wrap it up with a short ""season"" at full price. It seems to happen with shows canceled while they are still popular. (Think Treme, Eureka, etcetera.)
Call me cynical, but I can't help thinking that the production companies probably have a fair idea when they are going to cancel a show and could possibly wrap up the story without sucking us into paying out for a short final series.",1405900800,,755,4.5588235294117645

6113756,5,B00GTZWZH6,"Honestly, my wife and I were not aware of Warehouse 13's existence until about two months ago, and it hooked us very quickly.  It is a rare thing nowadays that I become emotionally attached to any character in any TV series, but W13's hooked us early and often.

We were crushed to find out that it's rating had slipped and That season 5 was it.  Just crushed.

This is quality television.  These are well developed quality characters with believable relationships that make the show really stand out from standard 2014 TV fare.

The kind of show that spawns a ""what are they going to do next"" kind of reaction from us.  And we are VERY picky TV viewers.  Very.

I recommend you get access to all 64 episodes and watch them, no more than one per night, and savor the experience.

Good Luck!

6113759,5,B00GTZWZH6,"So, I wanted to write this as a general comment on the really harsh negative reviews of this 5th and final season... it was meant to be a fun farewell to the series from Jack Kenny, the producers, writers and actors. The emotional peak of this show was in season 4, which had some of the finest writing and acting in the entire series. There was immense loss, death and devastation in Season 4 which marked an important evolution in both the writing and acting in the series, but in their final season, it appears they wanted to just have fun to close out the series.

Jack Kenny, the producers and writers were given a gift of a 5th season with a shortened 6 episodes to work with to resolve the Season 4 cliffhangers as well as produce the episodes they always wanted to produce but never had the chance to. For those who really critique how un-serious and absurd this season was, perhaps you need to revisit some of the old Warehouse 13 DVDs, particularly listening to the commentaries and/or podcasts.  There was a lot of meta/self-referential humor in the 5th season that you might understand and appreciate to if you listened to the commentaries/podcasts from the past seasons. The Spanish Telenovela and the Ren-Faire episodes were all fun romps into the worlds the producers, writers and actors always wanted to explore. They really weren't that different from the Fargo-from-Eureka-Video-Game or the Hard-Boiled-Detective episodes.

***SEASON 5 SPOILER ALERT***
The series didn't end exactly the way I wanted it to, particularly the sudden romantic relationship that developed between our beloved main characters. I thought the brother-sister relationship of Myka and Pete was something fun and refreshing instead of forcing a ""will-they-won't-they-Ross-and-Rachel"" type of thing and hitting the fans over the head with it every episode. I would have preferred that they were discussing in the first half of Season 5; having a child together and raising him or her with 2 adults in a platonic relationship. However, I do understand that Jack Kenny, et al. wanted to give the fans who really wanted Myka and Pete to get together a payoff for sticking through 5 seasons. I also thought the Season 4 Paracelsus cliffhanger was too conveniently wrapped up in the first episode and the Claire story-arc could have used a bit more fleshing out.

All that being said, and understanding that Universal CP & SyFy could have just ended the series after Season 4 and not lost any more money on it, I am glad that Jack Kenny, the writers, producers and actors were able to end the series on their terms. I am also glad Jack Kenny got to appear in the final scene of the final episode.

This series, Eddie McClintock's constant food references and Joanne Kelly's ridiculously thin t-shirts with plunging necklines will be thoroughly missed.

6113873,3,B00GTZWZH6,"I like watching shows when the series has ended, or is about to---to see everything episode after espisode, like an extended movie.  Such was the case with Warehouse 13, but it took re-watching the pilot, after the Final Episode, to see how far the series has sunk.  SyFy appears to have gotten bored.

Of course the very premise of the show is questionable at best---if even one of these artifacts is as dangerous as they are demonstrated to be, why would you put them all together in one place where the chances of some undesireable getting their hands on them, any of them, would be so much easier than having to traipse the world?  So, what we've got is something of a detective fantasy, where instead of high tech gizmos with which to solve crimes (or Grimm Fairy tale animals in real life) here the ""crimes"" are caused by artifacts that either someone has come into possession of accidentally, or has sought them out for illicit gain.  Secret Service agents Latimer and Bering are sent out on one mission after another to ""snag, bag, and tag"" these artifacts.

The early episodes, of the first two seasons or so, were a marvel of steam punk aesthetic paired with action adventure.  Remember when the Warehouse had a zipline?  The big old computer with the ancient typewriter keys?  The cast grew--nicely I thought---but the fantasy began to fade, the steampunk slipped ever further into the background.  I can't even really remember seeing much of it anywhere in Season 5.  And it's not just  that.  The whole show was getting ever more stupid (and it wasn't very literary from the start...) well before Season 4 came to a conclusion with Latimer acting like a boy-man moron.  Season 5 resolves the last episode in the first show, then it pops back and forth until---way too soon---we're at the sixth and final episode---the  Very End, which is billed as a sort of flash back (you know, where they run clips of past episodes) but in fact all of the stuff recalled consists either of out-takes or cuts, or stuff put together specifically for this show,, yet to look as if it happened in previous episodes, so it's not really flash backs in the usual sense.  Nice touch.

Still...

So it's over.  You'll want to watch these last episodes if you've watched the rest, and you won't be too terribly disappointed, but it is certainly sad to see how far the show fell from the tree that produced it, from the spell casting charm of the early episodes.

A Note:  I streamed all of season 5 as I have the others and these are all full episodes.  I found that SyFy does like to sell clips on Amazon but these are all full episodes.",1403827200,,2627,4.580299785867238

So its farewell to the main cast actors who all deserve huge credit for making the characters believable enough for us to invest in them over 5 seasons, and those great guest actors that made you say 'I know where I have seen him/her before', goodbye and thank you.",1402876800,,576,4.443396226415095

Maybe Amazon should consider doing what Netflix is doing with shows like House of Cards and go into the tv show business.  Another very good fan made show is the Star Trek Phase II.  These show that the STPII guys put on are top notch.  Amazon should enter into an agreement with STPII and market them, I know I'd love to own them all on dvd.",1402876800,6,491,4.11578947368421

(don't remember and don't have it handy), yet priced at a premium. You'd think with the growing popularity of NetFlix et all, that optical disk media would be coming down in price to compete. Doesn't seem to be the case. So I nick off a star for the gouging.",1402704000,,516,4.559139784946237

Some episodes have some tedious aspects, like the telenovela going on and on and on - a clever satire by being simply on the nose of the genre, but awkward & cringeworthy regardless... but overall it's very enjoyable, albeit sadly brief.

The last episode is kind of just a nostalgia trip, which is cute in its way but a little bit disappointing if you're not aware it's coming; really episode five is the last for the show.",1402617600,,491,4.632183908045977

Even if you hadn't heard that the series had been cancelled, season 5 felt like they were just trying to find a way to end the show and that any old way would do.  They tie up the cliff-hanger from season 4 fairly quickly, and everything starts to go downhill pretty quickly.  They force in a romance at the last second that should never, EVER have been attempted, they throw in yet another member of Claudia's family in a way that felt really random, they utilized an old villain rather than trying anything new.  The finale was disappointing in every conceivable way, particularly with what they did with Pete and Myka (which felt like it was written by someone who thought that the romance in Twilight was a little too well thought out).  If it weren't for the adorable father/daughter-esque relationship between Artie and Claudia, I would say that season 5 managed to do absolutely everything wrong.

6114112,5,B00GTZWZH6,"Enjoyed the final season, sad to see it go.  Hopefully it will come back out sometime in the future on syfy.",1400630400,,108,4.142857142857143
6114113,4,B00GTZWZH6,"I'm writing a review for the show-content as I have not yet received the DVD.
It's very sad to me that the television industry has been slowly caving in to the seeming need for senseless sex, violence and mindless craziness which seems to be the primary entertainment-diet of the average American brain these days. Such is the case with this fun and reasonably-intelligent series which, though it has plenty of violence and some sexual content, is far from mindless and can actually make you think.
In this final season, Mr. Valda, one of the Regents who govern the Warehouse, has returned from oblivion from an alternate timeline. He seeks to take over the Warehouse and move it to a new location where he can exploit the artifacts for profit and power. In the end Valda is foiled, and the season (and series) ends with the Warehouse moving to a new, undisclosed, location.
What I found most upsetting about this season of the show is that it was so short - only six episodes as opposed to the roughly 16 we are generally used to. It seems as if the people in charge of SyFy were tired of it and just threw it away! The same thing happened with Eureka which, though not quite as good in my opinion, was still a lot of fun and was really good sci-fi fantasy. At least with Eureka we got a full final season. The problem is that what this is being replaced with is material which I really don't like. I'm not a fan of reality-shows like Ghost Hunters or Ghost Mine (though I find the latter amusing enough to watch when there is absolutely nothing else on) nor do I like a steady diet of reality-competitions like Face-Off or the Jim Henson Creature Competition. And what in heck does wrestling have to do with science fiction ... anyone?
Getting back to Warehouse 13 itself, the full series is a rollicking roller-coaster ride through items psychically imbued with the essence of their original owners, where they came from and how to retrieve them. Lewis Caroll's Mirror has the soul of Alice Liddel trapped inside. W.C. Fields' juggling balls cause anyone holding them to act like they were drunk. A katana forged by the discoverer of the principle of folded steel is so sharp it can  bend light and render its wielder invisible. These and many more are the objects which the Warehouse was built to house and protect the world from. The team consists of two Secret Service agents, an FBI agent, a young genius and a psychic all led by a grumpy ex-smuggler. The stories are less about the artifacts and more about the people who have dedicated their lives to finding them and keeping them hidden. There are history lessons and plenty of references to mythology both well-known and obscure. And, for those who enjoyed Eureka, there were two crossover episodes in which a side romace between the characters of Douglas Fargo (Eureka) and Claudia Donovan (Warehouse 13) seemed to promise seeing more of both shows.
Finally, Warehouse 13 had many of the same qualities found in Doctor Who which has made that show the longest-running science-fiction television series of all time, as well as the longest scripted television series of any kind. The history they set up of the Warehouse changing hands could have been exploited if it was a cast-change which was necessary (though I don't think anyone was tired of any of the principles). It had the possibility of essentially going anywhere and to any genre, including futuristic space-opera. And the Warehouse itself is a lot like the TARDIS in many ways - a vehicle to the ""endless wonder"" which Mrs. Fredricks so often uses to sell life as a Warehouse Agent to prospective recruits.
All in all, Season 5 is a short and disappointing ending to series which was a lot of fun to watch. And there is nothing remotely similar coming to replace it - with the possible exception of Terry Pratchett's ""The Watch"" which is years away from airing. There is, however, the hope that someone will eventually pick up the story of the Warehouse with Warehouse 14.
As with the other seasons, Season 5 of Warehouse 13 is watchable by most people over the age of 10 or so. As always with my reviews I warn that kids can be very different at that age and those who are fearful might better wait a few years while braver 9-year-olds might eat this up. A good guage is if they like Doctor Who, they'll probably like Warehouse 13. And if you're worried about gun-violence, Warehouse Agents are armed with stun-guns called Teslas which are non-lethal.",1400630400,9,4475,4.6645569620253164

6114117,4,B00GTZWZH6,"This show is great.  It's a steampunk history driven adventure every episode.

Quick Summary:

There are ""Artifacts"" in the world that are powerful and dangerous.  To counter this threat the ""Warehouse"" has existed for centuries to protect mankind from the dangers.  Warehouse agents find these ""Artifacts"" and store them in the ""Warehouse"".  The ""Warehouse"" operates independently of world governments, but has to be moved for safety reasons occasionally from location to location or country to country and becomes dependant on its host nation for protection.  The current ""Warehouse 13"" is located in South Dakota in the United States and the Secret Service has been tasked with assisting the ""Warehouse"" with its mission.

This show could totally be moved to the History channel even though its got a ton of Sci-Fi in it.

It's too bad that NBC decided to cancel it after 5 seasons.",1400544000,,885,5.090277777777778

What has kept me watching, however, is not the Warehouse/device gimmick, but some interesting characters and clever and funny dialogue.  This show could easily lose the sci-fi aspect and become a standard buddy cop show and I would continue to watch merely for the laughs and the characters.  It is always lighthearted and, somehow, evades the feeling that each week is a repetition of the same plot structure.  The season-long story arcs are interesting and keep the character development moving forward without being overwhelming.  I admit, I will miss it after this season.

That said, I watched all five seasons. I loved the concept, the bits of history and culture woven into some fun adventures and artifacts. The concept is fantastic and I held onto that and Claudia's character more than anything. It did end when it needed to. Would love to see it come back someday with better acting and more natural relationships. Take the concept and run with it, develop it, and this may be a good show to come back and re-do (better) in a few years. Because, like I said, I love the concept and the idea of the show.

Two investigations going on simultaneously split up the team, with Artie, Myka, and Pete being trapped in a South American telenovella (soap opera) while Claudia and Jinks investigate a fraternity initiation ritual that involves a candle artifact. Both storylines split several characters into multiple personalities which make for some nice comedy, especially when the team trapped in the television melodrama find themselves speaking rather fluent spanish. The subtitles are very amusing, but not as much as the english-speaking actors skillfully reciting their over-the-top spanish dialogue.

However, if you're unacquainted with the series, here's a quick analogy:  Remember the last scene of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, in which some Pentagon janitor crates up the Ark of the Covenant and dollies it into an obscure corner of the sub-basement?  Throughout history, the Warehouses (which can be traced back to ancient Egypt) have been the repositories for similar artifacts -- though not all of them have been as sanctified as the Ark.  How about Edgar Allan Poe's quill pen?  Or Alice's looking glass?  What about the strings from Carlo Collodi's marionette woven together as a bracelet?  In the first episode of the series, Artie promises Pete and Myka ""Endless Wonder"" -- and the writers, directors, and cast have been delivering on that promise ever since.  The perfectly cast principals create just the right chemistry in the weekly combination of action, adventure, and more than a little humor.

And these knotheads ""program directing"" at the studios or Director's & Actor's Guild or whoever is ""controlling"" what the world gets to see, continue to air the trite vapid drivel of shows like Kardashian's, Jersey Shore, Housewive's, Honey Boo Boo and all the ""reality"" garbage! Shows like this involve thinking, reason, history, motive have nothing morally scandalous and hence are suitable for most all ages.",1398124800,4,667,4.808695652173913

6114241,5,B00GTZWZH6,"I love this show. It's offbeat, lighthearted, and interesting. There's a little history mixed in with the science fiction. Because it's on TV at the same time as another show I watch I am so glad that Amazon has it available the same day!",1398124800,,238,4.431818181818182

6114244,5,B00GTZWZH6,"Warehouse 13 is in it's final season and what a shame that is. The show has always been a show full of weirdness but thought provoking at the same time. It was at one time part of a triad of shows, Haven,Eureka and warehouse 13 that were the kind of shows that with the possible exception of Haven you could sit down and watch with the family and just have a great time, and lose yourself in for an hour. But now Eureka is gone, and this is warehouse 13's last season, I guess the SyFy channel believes in their original shows going out on top. I will truly miss this show.",1397779200,31,573,4.125
6114245,5,B00GTZWZH6,"Of course, you can't REALLY rate a season after only one episode has aired, but Warehouse 13 has an awesome track record of original and fun programming. Even though they had the rug pulled out from under them with this premature series ending  and with only SIX episodes  I don't have a doubt they'll be great action-packed episodes.

Watch the whole series if you haven't yet, then you'll be able to mourn with the rest of us when you watch season 5.",1397692800,,452,4.487804878048781

Whatever the reasons for ending the show at this time, we think the show must go on.  Perhaps a movie?  Or a prequel (Warehouse 12) or a follow-on series (Warehouse 14)?  Or possibly a spin-off (Dock 42 or 54)?  We're glad that the cast and crew of the series felt the same way about the show as we did.  Cynthia and I are hoping that the show will go on after a year off, like Murdoch did (?).  We hope many others will write in as we have to encourage the show's continuance.  Thank you for so many great characters and moments, Mark & Cynthia",1397520000,62,710,4.131386861313868
6114258,4,B00GTZWZH6,"This is a review and commentary about Warehouse 13.  I really like this show and am sorry to see it go (with only 6 episodes at that).  SYFY is famous for this which is one of the reasons that I dumped cable.  But I digress, for those of you that got season passes for this final season, this may interest you:

Amazon.com dropped the ball (again) with these extras that they are calling episodes which are only 6 or 7 minutes each.  I would urge you to contact amazon.com to get refunds x 2 ($1.89 each for standard def video).  They will need your order numbers which you can copy down from the emails you would have received when they notified you.  They did this before with other shows that were ending; trying to charge money for the tiniest of short extras that anyone could find online for free.

I got a full refund for the two charges because amazon.com didn't mean to charge us for it.  If you really want to pay the $1.89, go for it.  But amazon wasn't supposed to do that.  It happened before, it's happening now, and it will happen again.  You're welcome :D",1397433600,37,1071,4.326633165829146
6114259,5,B00GTZWZH6,"As someone who was so excited seeing the previews for Warehouse 13 back in the summer of 2009; and was hooked from the Pilot episode onward, I hate to see this series come to an end; but from what this 6 minute sneak peak revealed it truly does look as though it is going out on a high note, w/ the credit and respect it deserves. As the cast and crew say many, many times over, there will never be another show like Warehouse 13. It's been a great ride for us the fans; and now we look forward to watching these last few episodes. And for those of us who rely upon Amazon Prime for access to our favorite TV viewing, it's been fantastic to have access to the episodes @ a discounted Season Pass. Warehouse 13 and Amazon Prime, it doesn't get any better.",1397433600,25,754,4.171232876712328
6114260,3,B00GTZWZH6,"What is wrong with the idiots that canceled this fine series. I used to watch the Sci Fi channel (yeah before they changed it to Sy Fy)) a lot but now their programming stinks. Big time. Other channels are getting my viewing time with Agents of shield ,The 100,  Almost Human and so on. Was the channel acquired by some redneck ? This channel has deteriorated with more and more stupid reality programming and wrestling. It seems you forgot who your fan base was. I guess you just want to pander to the low IQ crowd. You are certainly achieving your goal. I guess you put Homer Simpson in charge of programming. If I could think of a way to excoriate you more I would most happily do so. So to the so called programming executives I bid you a big fat DUH !!!!! as it's seems to be the only thing you comprehend.

I seem to have forgotten to review the product. My bad ! (Just how do people write reviews for episodes the haven't aired yet ?)
I'm preordering this because I like every season of Warehouse 13 so far.

Series I miss

Eureka
Special Unit 2
Dead Like me
The Sentinel
Friday the 13th

I would watch reruns of these in preference to the crud Sy Fy channel purveys now.

Well, one episode to go and another one bites the dust. Tomorrow 05/19/2014 the last episode ""Endless"" airs live and then it's adios WH13. Although they call this season 5 I have bought seasons 1-4 and just viewed them from beginning to end. Season 4 contains 20 episodes so I feel that season 5 began after the world was saved from the sweating plague in season 4 episode 11. For me season 5 began with S4 episode 12 and finished up this year with the final 6 episodes. Because the series was ending the final episodes don't have the chance to really develop the bad guy Alternate Reality Valda and manage to defeat him in 1 episode. I'm only buying this season to complete the series in my collection.",1396828800,11,1895,4.351274787535411
6114261,1,B00GTZWZH6,"I am unhappy this is the last season,once again when their is a good show,they have to cancel it.
Also, why is the price so high at $35.98. You only get 6 episodes. Amazon needs to drop the price in half. Season 4 is around $34.00 and it has a lot more episodes then season 5. A lot more people will buy season 5,since it is the last season, if amazon drops their price.

Know amazon raised the price to $28.68, it was down to around $25.00. you guys really think we will spend that much, we will shop else where.",1394064000,21,513,4.079207920792079

6114265,5,B00GTZWZH6,"this is my favorite tv show & it just boggles my mind that the imbeciles at NBC/Comcast are cancelling it, especially as it is the highest rated show ever on what used to be SCI FI channel.  you can actually watch it with your kids (about 8 & up; younger ones might not understand it): nothing objectionable---no sex, no violence, no language.  AND, KIDS CAN ACTUALLY LEARN HISTORY FROM IT IN A REALLY FUN WAY!!!! The actors are terrific and it's lots of fun, with references to all sorts of literature, too, and fantasy/sci fi (Star trek, wizard of oz).  the dialogue is snappy.  what could be better?????  so they replace it with reality tv and wrestling????  how is that science fiction??",1390953600,272,691,4.622950819672131

8627509,5,B00GTZWZH6,"I love Warehouse 13, This being the final season it was a bittersweet thing. When I originally watched it on TV, I was so upset that it was ending that I didn't appreciate or enjoy it as I should have. Seeing it now the thing that amazes me is how incredible it is. The writers/producers/actors stayed true to the characters and concepts of the show from beginning to end. Brilliant, engaging stories, astonishing dialogue...not many shows have so many unique voices!

It's hard to pick a favorite episode, but Claudia probably had the best story arc of the season. Her peculiar family issues have always played an important part in the show, and this season the addition of a new member of the family adds to her character's angst. The biggest surprise was the inclusion of the Pete/Myka storyline In truth I definitely saw this coming in season 2, but then they seemed to drop it. I was resigned to it never being resolved, yet here it is taking center stage once more. Brilliant!

The inclusion of the Holiday Episode makes me very happy. It's one of my top four favorites Christmas episodes pf any show ever to air on television. Kudos to the cast and crew for maintaining their excellence for five seasons. The only thing that would make me happier would be a new movie!

I'm still watching all the bonus features. There are so many podcasts and special bits included that it will take me some time to watch them all. Suffice to say, you'll laugh as much watching that as you will watching the episodes. I will miss these characters and I'm glad I can rematch them again and again.",1517875200,,1586,4.577464788732394
