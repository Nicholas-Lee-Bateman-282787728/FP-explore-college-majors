7956590,4,B00005Y70R,THIS IS A VERY GOOD AND ENTERTAINING MOVIE. THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST VERY  DELIGHTIFUL TO WATCH. AND I REALLY LIKED IT...,1363651200,,121,4.761904761904762
7956591,4,B00005Y70R,"First, Bruce Li is always very entertaining to watch. Second, the fight scenes did have good choreography.
On the other hand, the actual plot of this movie makes Bruce Lee appear ""goofy"". The director made Bruce Li (Ho Chung Tao) who plays Bruce Lee, overact his role. Normally, Ho Chung Tao is a very good actor. In this movie, the plot is a bit weird. the director shows Lee actually laughing in an exagerated manner while dying! The director portrays Lee as an obsessive and compulsive person who is very hyper and sleeps around on his wife.
I like Ho Chung Tao, but, I did not understand what the director's point with this movie was.
Was Bruce Lee goofy? Was Lee crazy?
I rate this movie with 4 stars only because Ho Chung Tao has some good fight scenes.
I would like to add that the director even manages to make Ho Chung Tao look a bit ""wimpy"" and unskilled in the fighting scenes.
This is another example of a movie that has a great cast and a horrible director.",1198540800,,970,4.394444444444445
7956592,3,B00005Y70R,"1st things 1st, the following review is for The Dragon Lives(not to be confused with ""Bruce Lee:The Man,the Myth"" which also happens to be entitled ""The Dragon Lives"" in some countries), starring the man himself, Ho Chung Tao. Having seen and collected virtually every attempted Bruce Lee biopic, I had The Dragon Lives to arrive a couple of days ago, and having watched it for the 1st time in life(I swear, this movie got NO play in ATL back in the 80's), my overall impression was that TDLives, in comparison to the other biopics, was one of the WEIRDEST approaches to the life of Bruce Lee one could ever imagine. Here we have a Bruce Lee who acts HOKEY and BUFFOONISH(reminding you more of Jackie Chan at 1st than Bruce Lee), a persistent GOOD OMEN/BAD OMEN THEME/SEQUENCE(w/t thunderbolts, earthquakes and all),a terribly happy-go-lucky soundtrack, exagerrated on-the-spot challenges/feuds, and a rather STRANGE approach to his death(a rather long, drawn out, and over-killed sex scene with Betty Ting Pei, after which he laughs like a madman before ""dying""). However, the positives are the way Bruce's character is matured with experience, the action/fight choreography is strong(awesome recreations of Big Boss and Fist of Fury are there), and even his ""feud"" with the ""boxing champion"" from the Long Beach competition, in my opinion, gave us a glimpse at what might have been had Bruce Lee and Muhammad Ali gotten into the ring and squared off. Pretty much, TDLives is to Bruce Lee:The Man,the Myth as the Last Temptation of Christ would be in comparison and contrast with the Passion of the Christ. Great movie, lots of action, lots of laughs(via the comical,Jackie Chan-like approach to Bruce's character), and it was true to the time in which Bruce Lee lived...however, contrary to the claims of the production team, TDLives is far from being the most accurate Bruce Lee biopic. There's only a glimpse of his marriage and Brandon Lee(no Shannon) and then he jumps into an affair and ""dies"" laughing. WEIRD, and for once I'd recommend Bruce Lee:A Dragon Story and Bruce Lee and I over a particular biopic,but TDLives is still a keeper.",1144454400,,2145,4.977715877437326
7956593,5,B00005Y70R,"What a cracker of a film...  I bought this film years ago and it has made me laugh EVERY time I watch it...  From characters like the King of Hong Kong, the Army Sargent with who constantly says 'Little Bleeder', Bruce Li spliting his trousers on film, the crappy training machine....  This film is a corker...  As an extra in the movie says ""Fist of Fury was a beautiful movie"" in a dubbed cockney voice, so is this film but for all the wrong reasons...  Comedy at its best...  Where did my funky flares go & cuban heels go now.....",1075593600,,533,4.28
