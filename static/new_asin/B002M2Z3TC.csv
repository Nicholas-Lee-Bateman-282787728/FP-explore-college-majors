3950749,2,B002M2Z3TC,"STAR TREK's Walter Koenig penned this movie which plays more like an episode of LAW AND ORDER than a sci-fi/horror flick.  Unfortunately, it's as exciting as watching drapes fade.
The creature is horribly done and amateurish.  Richard Hatch is awful and Koenig is worse!  The dialogue and direction are bad and the whole cast is ineffective.  Koenig drives his point of ""equal rights"" with a heavy hammer but doesn't entirely pull it off.
Better acting and creature effects might have made a better flick, but this misfire doesn't make the grade.",1299888000,2,546,4.967032967032967
3950750,5,B002M2Z3TC,"Never heard about it in the theaters, don't know if it was just released to DVD, but a nice Saturday night film.",1289952000,,112,4.136363636363637
3950751,4,B002M2Z3TC,"An interesting take on the ethical questions revolving around abortion, cloning and genetic manipulation.  Cast was excelent.  Kudos to Mr Koenig.",1280188800,,146,5.904761904761905
3950752,3,B002M2Z3TC,"This movie is not nearly as bad as some make it out to be.  It has a story that is entertaining enough, and some of the actors are pretty decent, especially Marina Sirtis and Erick Avari as competing lawyers, the young blond woman playing the scientist's lover, and Richard Hatch as the man who develops a bond with his alien child.  Danielle Koenig and Andrew Koening are also good in brief roles as a comedienne and a crazed research assistant.  The production values are not too bad except that the alien creature is rather cheesy.  Also, the crowd outside the courtroom is shown too many times, and I think the female lawyer misquotes ""Ozymandias"" with the wrong context.

the ending is a bit of a mess and rather predictable, but then it's confusing when the blonde woman is pregnant and we can only assume, or hope, that it is a human child in there this time instead of an alien.
Still, it is entertaining and filled with many Sci fi actors that fans will recognize; along with the others mentioned, there is Gary Graham, Patricia Tallman, JG Hertzler, etc.",1273449600,5,1064,4.608465608465608
3950753,1,B002M2Z3TC,"just finished watching this --- well, after 20 minutes began fast forwarding until the end so I really don't know (and don't care) how it ended.  If you like good artwork, then you should buy this DVD for the cover artwork which is very geiger-esque in nature...

the actors also are semi-recognizable --- marina sirtis for one --- I have always liked her but have rarely seen her without a star trek uniform on...  and, as much as I like marina sirtis in star trek, the few minutes i tolerated of her in this movie i wasn't sure if this were all tongue in cheek or if the writers were seriously trying to make a statement.  Koenig seems to have kept himself ""up"" after all these years as well -- that was good to see...

this is a stupid movie --- they are trying to make some point about our constitutional rights versus prejudice versus whatever...  If I had wanted to see a movie based on that I would have bought something like that ---

it's a shame that I didn't watch this movie right when I bought it within the 30 day period, because I could have returned it and got a partial refund...

this movie has no special effects --- no sci-fi scenes --- it's a cross between a really bad comedy and god only knows what ---",1269907200,3,1225,4.2956521739130435
3950754,1,B002M2Z3TC,"DVD cover:  great and interesting looking artwork.  I think 40% of the budget went into making it.  Two reviews on the back of DVD case: Lame. One reads, ""It's Alien meets Kramer vs. Kramer"" by Sci-Fi weekly.  NO, it is not.  Story: Barely interesting, and then the terrible effects kills it.  Most of the acting is horrible (which is somewhat entertaining).  The story changes gears from the beginning to midpoint, shifting from serious, to some comic relief, then to never ending court scenes.  Don't waste your time on this movie.  Maybe the book is interesting, but the movie was unveiled out of this world lameness.",1265846400,2,620,4.828571428571428
3950755,5,B002M2Z3TC,"I loved this movie. In today's world, we rate sci-fi movies on how many CGI effects are used, how loud the music is, and fast can we change from scene to scene. Walter Koenig's ""InAlienable"" is none of the above. It is not fast paced, no loud music booming from 5 speakers, and no spaceship battles. To me, this movie was like reading a good book. It's a great story - in some ways reminded me of ""The Outer Limits"" tv show. The characters are well developed and believable (Richard Hatch has never been better - an amazing performance, and Mr. Koenig plays ""evil"" better than anyone else working in movies today - he is chilling in this film). Aside from the sci-fi element, the movie has a message that speaks for today, and even about our Constitutional rights. This is where Mr. Keonig's talents as a writer shines. This is like the movies of Frank Capra - the times and challenges in which Capra lived (the 30's and 40's) disguised in an entertainment - and they have become time machines for us. We can look back at a Capra movie, like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and get a real sense of how the country felt and lived at that time. Well, I will say that ""InAlienable"" does the same thing. It will make you take a second look at our society and our legal system.  Don't buy this movie if you want laser guns, aliens attacking the world, people being beamed up, or racing through the galaxy .... but DO buy it if you want a good story that might make you think a little more about our REAL world and the times in which we live.",1264896000,12,1534,4.307958477508651
3950756,1,B002M2Z3TC,"I got a bigger rush on the picture on the dvd cover than the whole movie.
Is this a recent movie...look and feels like its 3 decades old or more..
From the first seconds in the movie you know youve been had.
  Very little budget...very slow moody music....very little actors/actress
I don't recommend this movie at all, and i do recommend all involved in this crap
to be fired.  If it was on tv...i would have turned it off.
I want my money back..!!!!",1264723200,2,451,4.345238095238095

8373445,5,B002M2Z3TC,"Richard Hatch gives a heartfelt, soulful performance that is surely one of the very best of his career.  This is foremost a movie about relationships, and Richard's character Eric runs the gamut of emotions authentically and perfectly.

8373448,5,B002M2Z3TC,"It isn't a lot of action or fast-paced thriller that makes you sit on the edge of your seat; it's a realistic view of humanity and the diffferent choices we'd make in certain situations. You can't review this like a typical movie because it's an artistic film, and those are made to make the person watching them take a step back and think. Personally, I liked the movie a lot. So much so that I only watched the first half of the rented DVD before buying it! (I waited until it arrived to finish) Some of the acting is not the best, but the point got across just the same, and I really enjoyed seeing so many people from the Star Trek franchise.",1409788800,2,646,4.260162601626016
8373449,3,B002M2Z3TC,"I actually have a german 3d blu ray of this one.  In Germany they take many low budget sci fi films and turn them into 3d films with a computer.  So my picture looks better than what you will see on this dvd.  But the film has a good story. It doesn't have much money to tell it but the story is fine.  Richard Hatch is excellent as the 'farther' of a alien who he gives birth too. The rest of the cast if fine too and the leading lady is very gorgeous. And she can act too. This is not a monster movie though it's like a twilight zone episode , which is a good thing.  it's a thoughtful movie and that's a interesting twist for a sci fi film.  Of course ,  you could slag this movie for having a small person with attached tentacles play the 'child' but this isn't a cgi movie.  I got past that and enjoyed the film.",1401753600,,817,3.9390243902439024
8373450,3,B002M2Z3TC,Good premise for movie but could have used a little more information in the story. It was really thought provoking idea. Would a person that has a lot of tech installed in them so they can fiunction still be human?,1363478400,,214,4.375
8373451,2,B002M2Z3TC,"This movie isn't bad, alitle longer than it should be. It could have done more with the alien creature than it did. It is slow in parts and is a good idea for  movie but i wished it had more action in it than it did. It's worth watching when you can't find anything else to watch.",1316217600,2,280,3.912280701754386
8373452,1,B002M2Z3TC,"The concept as potencial,the drama does not make you believe in the actor`s.
To much missing part the story goes to fast, that make you feel lost.
The movie as grate actor, but the exageration of the caractor make you feel like they don't belong in that type of story.

8373453,3,B002M2Z3TC,"I bought this movie for one reason. I'm a big Star Trek fan and wanted to see what Walter Koenig had done here. Well, the concept was good. Some of the acting was good. But, it just didn't really work. Its obvious that its a low budget movie and that's fine but sometimes laughable. I was actually into the movie emotionally until they got to the courtroom scenes and then it just lost me. I think they tried to inject some humor into the movie but it just DID NOT work. I love Walter Koenig and Marina Sirtis (Walter did great, Marina not so much) but some of the lines came across pretty lame. Anyway, if you have a couple of hours with nothing else to do then buy and watch this movie. Otherwise, keep on truckin....",1303171200,3,719,4.255474452554744
