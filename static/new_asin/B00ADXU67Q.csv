8550293,5,B00ADXU67Q,"Great, old school cartoons! They're very hard to find. I highly recommend this for WWII animation fans. Thunderbean did an amazing job finding and restoring them, as can be expected. :) The rare Private Snafu cartoons are also a real treat.",1478304000,,240,4.878048780487805
8550294,4,B00ADXU67Q,"Great cartoons from both the Allies and Axis. Propaganda films are always interesting, and these were very good, though I wish that the Soviet one had subtitles. I got the drift of the message (it was obvious) but I would have liked to have understood what Comrade Commissar was saying.",1448928000,,286,4.74

8550296,5,B00ADXU67Q,"Thunderbean animation is a company passionate about cartoons. Their restorations are excellent and this DVD set offers a wide variety of war-related cartoons the way they should be seen.

More Cartoons for Victory contains historical artifacts which are not necessarily appropriate (or entertaining) for children without context. There are a great deal of racial stereotypes here, which is part of what makes this set so fascinating. Mr. Churkill offers the Italian perspective of Great Britain's leader, which depicts Churchill as a money-hungry monster who is stopped by the heroic Nazis. A seemingly innocent German cartoon about a coniferous tree who pines to grow leaves shows a Jew greedily stealing the golden leaves. The American Tokio Jokio depicts familiar puns from Warner Brothers studios but is rife with Japanese stereotypes. In addition to entertainment, this set includes informational shorts and propaganda. A Few Quick Facts series was created to disseminate information to the troops and covers a variety of topics from fear to diarrhea. These aren't just traditional animated cartoons either. There are still image stories and films mixed with live action footage.",1428105600,2,1184,5.5054945054945055
8550297,3,B00ADXU67Q,"Disappointing in that there are no subtitles for the foreign cartoons, which I understand would be expensive to do,there are brief liner notes explaining some of them. However, another DVD in the series, ""Private Snafu"", had copious, and overly extensive liner notes not really needed. Shouldn't have been hard to come up with some sort of translations.

Update: I found the subtitles but they just showed how boring the foreign cartoons were. The U.S. Cartoons can be found elsewhere, i.e., ""Private Snafu"" which I already had so I find this collection marginally interesting, at best.",1420761600,3,586,5.168421052631579
8550298,5,B00ADXU67Q,"What remains the most amazing thing about this collection is the animated axis propaganda - proof that brutes and thugs have no sense of humor....or, like their totalitarian successors, are too dense to understand self-directed sarcasm.  Another amazing collection from Sir Steven of Stanchfield.",1377561600,5,296,5.7272727272727275
8550299,5,B00ADXU67Q,"This dvd is a sequel to the original CARTOONS FOR VICTORY.  God only knows where they discover these films from all around the world, no less.  My favorite is TOKIO JOKIO, very funny, but anti-Japanese.  This 1943 Warner Bros., cartoon looks great, and is restored by Thunderbean (It says so at the end of every short).  There is also THE SAILOR AND THE SEAGULL, a 1944 'toon that I've never heard of or seen.  I think the guys at UPA were behind it.  The Walt Disney studios are represented here with ANOTHER CHANCE, a black&white, 1945 offering.  Some of these cartoons are so odd that they defy description.  You really have 2 watch the disc at least three times, to fully enjoy and understand what they're trying to convey.  One selection that I can't get off my mind was THE LITTLE TREE THAT WISHED FOR DIFFERENT LEAVES, a 1940 Nazi Germany curiosity, and is both poignant and reflective.  Thunderbean has done it again.  This could be an fantastic educational tool in the high schools if used properly.",1360540800,12,1008,4.638418079096045
8550300,5,B00ADXU67Q,"Once again Thunderbean video delivers a quality product of rare, hard to find animation. This is a worthy companion to the original ""Cartoons for Victory"". You cannot go wrong with any Thunderbean release, as they ensure the finest transfers available. "" Mr. Churchkill "" must be seen to be believed. Without a doubt, worth the price of this DVD alone.",1359590400,8,352,4.883333333333334
