4494515,1,B004XC5LPK,"I had several problems with this movie.

First, the entire movie was filmed with a soft focus. I can understand something like that for dream scenes, but not for a while movie.

Second, the main characters seemed unable to work at a burger joint let alone as a specialized team searching for survivors in an area contaminated with a deadly toxin. The team leader showed no leadership ability at all. The other three members were completely unable to follow simple orders.

Third, the movie made little to no effort to explain what was happening to the team and the ending made no sense. Now some people like movies that leave most of the details to the viewer's imagination--I'm not one of them.

Finally, the movie is incredibly slow paced. A lot of screen time is given to scenes that added nothing to what plot there is. In one scene, a character took over two minutes to search a small three stall restroom. Of course in the middle of the scene we were treated to him deliberately peeing all over one of the toilets. That added so much to the plot of the film--NOT!

If you enjoy movies like this one, then get the popcorn ready. For those who don't, save your money and your time and give this one a miss.",1312416000,7,1210,4.457013574660634
8446741,1,B004XC5LPK,"This was very bad. Here's why:
slow - at one point they're checking for dead people in a toilet. It takes the guy 10 seconds to check one stall. Not really an action movie. They're just wasting time so a 5 minute plot lasts for 90 minutes. There's no one in the stall - move on.
dark - The whole movie is 4 guys in hazmat suits with the worst flashlights in the world in an abandoned office building at night, so 90% of the time your screen is 90% dark. Oh, there's some little monster too, bringing the actor count to 5.
can't hear - actors usually talk through their gas masks, so you may not know what they're saying.
can't tell actors apart - hazmat suits make them all look alike. They're like penguins.
dumb - the plot was stupid. I still don't understand half of it.
few actors - since they can't afford many actors, there's scenes where they just stare at things or talk to themselves.
Just a very stupid, very bad movie. Why would anyone make this movie? I doubt if it took more than a couple of hours to write AND shoot. 5 actors, a voice on the radio, which could have also been the camera person.",1528156800,,1108,4.206572769953052
8446742,1,B004XC5LPK,"Why do people make movies like this? If you are going to spend the time getting funding and actually filming it, why not spend 15 minutes coming up with a plot that half-way makes sense?

If you just want to film some wacky scenes, that's cool. It just seems that a semi-coherent generic plot stringing those scenes together could have been cool too.",1527379200,,350,4.555555555555555
8446743,3,B004XC5LPK,"Nothing is really explained and it's low budget. The acting is alright, I've seen far worse. There's a few parts you might call Jump scares but then no movie ever really gets Me in that department.",1523836800,,197,4.5

8446745,2,B004XC5LPK,"***Spoilers Ahead*** Bio-Dead was an awesome movie. I wish I could say it was awesome from start to finish but...... I was hooked right from the beginning, wondering if the team was going to find whatever they were searching for or if whatever it was that was hunting them, would be able to pick them off 1 by 1. I enjoyed the dialogue, banter, the back and forth, whatever you call it between the team members. It felt like an actual work crew and not just a group of actors. I was really into this movie until, The Torture Table. That scene ruined it for me. I didn't see the point of it. Now all of a sudden, the team members that were killed off are coming back as Zombies to torture the members who are still alive? It does pick up again in the end but it really didn't matter anymore. The movie was spoiled for me. I especially liked the mini movie after the movie was over & the credits were rolling. I think it was well done. An ending after the ending? Bio-Dead had potential. It started off awesome, only to be ruined by a pointless scene that was done to show off an unnecessary amount of gore. I would've recommended anybody go see Bio-Dead up until the Torture Table scene but after that, I'm not so sure",1495411200,,1217,4.2727272727272725
8446746,5,B004XC5LPK,"Pulpy, grindhouse-esque film.  The cover art reminds me of 80s horror VHS which I love.  Yeah it takes a while to get going but I love the grungy, very low budget feel.",1491523200,,168,4.21875
8446747,1,B004XC5LPK,I wish I'd never ordered this dvd. The movie died within the first teen minutes of the movie. I'll give it a white belt:(,1381795200,,121,4.083333333333333
8446748,2,B004XC5LPK,"BIO-DEAD is a real dead film, shot in an office like many of us have or do work in, some of the ""Dead"" characters who all have japanese horror shakes actually remind me of real live people who I have dealt with in offices. My opinion of ""BIO-DEAD"" is very low in fact I highly recommend filing it in file 13. Once in more than enough. Do not buy this movie, it ain't bad that would be too nice a thing to say about it.",1352505600,2,418,3.929411764705882
8446749,1,B004XC5LPK,"Slow, boring, uninteresting, and leaving one wondering what is happening. I only finished it because I paid for it. Spend your hard earned dollar elsewhere.",1330128000,5,156,5.28
8446750,1,B004XC5LPK,"Should be re-titled, ""BIO-CRAP""!

YES... I was stupid enough to pay $10 for this one!!!  Save your time and money. Basically, below low budget film about 4 guys wondering around in an abandoned office building for almost an hour and a half.... like I said.... BORING!!!!!!!  I'm sure the maker of this piece of crap thought it would be scary to have a bald blue skin guy show up here and there with a jittery shaking head, like we've seen many, many, many... many times before (like in ""Fear.com"" and so on...).  Seen it!!  Nothing new here, except more boredom. If you do decide to be unfortunate enough to watch this garbage, keep the remote close by... the Fast Forward button will come in handy.  Recommended viewing time... less than 5 minutes (less than 1 min. is best)!!!!

This is one of those ones you wish you could join a class action suit against the maker and all those involved, just to get recovery for time, money, and not to mention pain and suffering!!!!

CAN I GET A REFUND???!!!!!",1323648000,3,1000,4.5474860335195535
