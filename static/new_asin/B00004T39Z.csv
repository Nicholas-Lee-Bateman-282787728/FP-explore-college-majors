1348962,2,B00004T39Z,"Very disappointed. Like a fool, I bought it because I saw the words ""Peanuts Classic"" on the front of the case. Had I flipped it over I would have noticed it was copyrighted in the year 2000. I had thought it was an older video that I simply missed. Snoopy and the gang are hardly in the video. If you enjoy watching mice Riverdancing and squaredancing, and like the old ""corrupt Mayor"" routine, then you will enjoy this video. The only thing that remotely made this worth some of the purchase was the Charles Schulz interview on the DVD. That was interesting. However, I still recommend not purchasing this at list price.",970531200,4,622,4.5625
1348963,2,B00004T39Z,This is not Schulz who drew all the strips in this video.  There are adults--lots of them which is so un-Schulz as he does not believe in having  adults appear in his strips or his videos.  I think Schulz probably died  before this video was completed and someone drew it for him to complete  this project.  I was at first excited being a long time Peanuts fan of the  upcoming video and after purchasing the DVD of this video and I am appalled  with the style it was done and the inclusion of adults.,969235200,2,501,4.25531914893617
1348964,4,B00004T39Z,"This is a little different from the other ""Peanuts"" specials, as it places Charlie Brown and the gang in the retelling of The Pied Piper of  Hamelin.
It begins with Charlie Brown telling little sis Sally the story  of The Pied Piper.  Just like in Hamelin, their town once was overrun with  mice.  Charlie Brown goes to the mayor's office with a simple solution:  make Snoopy the Pied Piper.
Promised a year's supply of dog food for his  services, Snoopy (armed with a concertina instead of a pipe) begins to  magically lure the mice out of town.  But as soon as the mice are gone,  the mayor goes back on his promise!  So Snoopy plays his concertina once  again, magically compelling the mayor and his council to dance out of town  to the tune of ""Snoopy, the Pied Piper.""  All's well that ends  well.
It's good to see the gang doing something a little different for  a change, but though I liked this story, I prefer original Peanuts tales  rather then faerytale retellings.
As for this DVD release, there's some  good and bad.  The good is the bonus feature of a special 11 minute  retrospective interview with Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz.  The bad  is that though Paramount is highly promoting their video release of  ""Pied Piper"" with a chance to win one of 50 original cels from  the making of the film, the sweepstakes will not be available with the DVD  release.  Ah well.  Diehard fans will buy both I'm sure....",965779200,13,1427,4.559523809523809

1348967,3,B00004T39Z,"Not one of the best episodes of Snoopy and Charlie Brown.  I thought the animation was horrible and sloopy.  Story line is ok, but if you are a die hard fan, I would pass this up.  I bought the VHS version at Wal-mart in St. Petersburg, FL for $3.00.",1141084800,2,250,4.061224489795919
1348968,1,B00004T39Z,"This is the poorest excuse for a Charlie Brown cartoon I've ever seen. The animation is cheap, and it's packed with pointless padding designed to fill out 23 1/2 minutes. Toddlers won't care, of course, but anybody who feels affection for classic Peanuts will hate this shoddy direct-to-video program.",1098576000,8,301,5.163265306122449
1348969,1,B00004T39Z,"I'm thankful that I took this loser of a cartoon out of the library instead of purchasing it. This is the worst Charlie Brown film ever made and the folks involved in its creation should be ashamed. Charles Schulz would not be pleased. First of all, it features adults! Charlie Brown is supposed to be a kids-only universe, where adults are not even audible, let alone seen. The grown-up animation looks nothing like the peanuts - it's as though modern animation had been cut and pasted into the show. The story line is stupid, there is no existential angst to be found, and Charlie Brown SMILES all throughout. AAAAAGH!
If you love Peanuts, don't see this one - it'll break your heart.",1065312000,15,686,4.631147540983607
1348970,4,B00004T39Z,"Although, this one is done with a different style than the other Peanuts videos, we enjoyed this one just as much if not more.  In this one, they show the adults and they really talk.  The whole video had an upbeat mood, and there was music, dancing and humor.  I just wish it was a little longer or included another video since it seems short.  This video also includes an interesting look at Peanuts through the years with the creator, Mr. Schultz.",1004745600,,450,4.451219512195122
1348971,1,B00004T39Z,"...if he could possibly see this movie!
I am a life-long Peanuts fan, and I I heard that a new Film does come out (I am from Germany) I just had to get it!!!
In all the years the animated Characters looked more and more similar to the Comic strip. But this film could have been done better by myself!!! The Characters don't look like themselfes. The Lip-Synch isn't given. AND the Characters are all drawn and colored on the Computer, wich doesnt fit at all to the old epidsodes. All Characters in the Film that doesnt belong to the Peanuts gang itself, look like a crossover between the Peanuts and Garfield.
The Retrospective with Mr. Schulz is just the 30Year Charlie Brown Special, with some additionalcomments. (Althoug i never seen the the DVD before I had known every word. Because I have the Special in German on Video.)
Collectors like me got it already.
But anyone else... ...please don't buy!

1348972,1,B00004T39Z,"Don't get me wrong. I love Schultz/Melendez animated films, and have amassed quite a library of Peanuts videos & DVDs.  I have posted a number of 4- and 5-star reviews on Amazon. But ""Pied Piper"" is terribly disappointing.
The Peanuts gang is relegated to, at best, a supporting role in this production, which is primarily populated by poorly-drawn townspeople who don't look like anything that has ever come from Charles Schultz's pen.  The animation looks cheap and hurried (in many parts, they didn't even try to make the mouths sync with the dialogue).  Even when the Peanuts characters do appear, they frequently do not look like themselves. A scene with Schroeder pops to mind -- he looks like a fourth-grader's attempt to draw Schroeder, rather than like the genuine article.  The whole package -- the animation, the music, the story -- just doesn't feel like a Peanuts film.  I grieve to think that this is being sold as some sort of capstone to the late Charles Schultz's career. Unless you're a Peanuts completist, your money would be better spent on any other Peanuts film.
With all that complaining out of the way, I should note that the DVD does include a charming -- if a bit short -- retrospective and interview with Charles Schultz. That is a nice touch that I wish had been appended to a worthier program.  I'm looking forward to DVD releases of other, classic Peanuts programs, and hope they include similar extras.",978048000,6,1433,4.804878048780488
1348973,2,B00004T39Z,"As much as I hate to admit it, I must rate the new Peanuts video as being ""for collectors only"".  On one hand, it's interesting, (for a while, anyway), to see the gang re-interpreting a classic story, but the novelty soon wears thin.  The fault lies mostly, I think, with the team of animators.  Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelson are once again at the helm of this production, but the animation looks nothing like the classic specials that preceded this one.  Much of it has that ""no frills"" Saturday-morning-cartoon look that the other Peanuts specials managed to avoid. Look closely at some of the drawings, and you'll notice that the animators just did not do a good job of copying Schulz's art work; the characters just don't look like themselves.  There are also far too many long stretches where nothing happens. For instance, in the opening sequence before the title credits run, Snoopy appears on top of his doghouse, playing his accordion.....and playing.....and playing.......and playing......with what looks to be the same few frames of animation used over and over.  This also happens in a later scene when Schroeder is shown playing his piano........and playing......and playing......and playing...........  The same idea is repeated near the end of the video when the ""Mayor"" and his cohorts are shown singing ""barbershop quartet"" style, and they keep singing........and singing......well, you get the idea.  Suffice it to say, this one is not plot driven.  On the ""plus"" side, David Benoit does a great job (as always) with Vince Guaraldi's original scores, and the 10 minute retrospective with Charles Schulz after the cartoon, makes the tape worth having. If you're like me, and a die-hard fan of anything Charles Schulz did, you'll have to own it, but you'll still find yourself wishing the entire production was just a little bit better.",971136000,12,1854,5.072368421052632

7922224,3,B00004T39Z,"To be brutally honest, this is probably the worst of the Peanuts specials. It lacks the clever humor of the other specials and - like a lot of events - the adults ruin it. However, if you are a diehard Peanuts fan you will want to see this if only to roll your eyes and be in on the joke when someone makes a snarky comment about It's the Pied Piper Charlie Brown.

Even a bad Peanuts special is better than a lot of others, so that , and the fact that I am smitten with Snoopy, makes me feel generous and give it three stars.",1457136000,,526,3.9622641509433962

7922229,1,B00004T39Z,"O.K., the first 5 minutes of this video special are not bad, but once Charlie Brown starts telling Sally the story of the Pied Piper you may as well pop the disc out.

In true Peanuts tradition, this story should have been told from the perspective of Charlie Brown & the Peanuts Gang.  Instead we have ADULTS TALKING & discussing their problems.  Through out the entire show, I kept thinking of the way it should have been told.

Now this is not the first Charlie Brown Special to include adult voices, that violation goes back to ""SNOOPY's REUNION"" where the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm owner talks for no reason at all.

The bonus material is not specific to this special, it is more of a general look at the making of these specials.  It's likely the specific reason for including it here is to fill out the disc beyond the 25 minute story.

There are many other Charlie Brown DVDs worthy of purchasing, buy this only if you are a completist.",1228435200,3,940,4.461988304093567
7922230,5,B00004T39Z,you can't go wrong with Charles M. Schulz. Who doesn't love Charlie Brown and the whole Peanuts Gang! It's a classic. fun for the whole family.,1209686400,,143,4.538461538461538
7922231,1,B00004T39Z,"I'm 37 years old and grew up watching the peanuts specials which I love, but hadn't seen this one so I picked it up and was extremely disappointed in what I saw.  Charles Schultz is credited as writer, but this 'classic' is copywrited 2000 and released posthumously to Mr. Schultz's death-I can't believe he would have green-lighted the release if he had viewed the final cut.  Hardly the 'swan song' of an amazing career!

The video starts out okay, but once we get into the retelling of the 'Pied Piper' story the whole thing quickly degenerates into a mish-mash of hurried, sub-par animation, pointless diologue, extended filler musical scenes, and painful character interactions (yes, we get it, the mayor is a jerk and doesn't want to pay the Pied Piper). Where the REAL classics had an underlying, deeper philosophy that impacted and touched both children and adults, in this one Charlie brown actually verbalizes ""...the moral of the story is..."" In summary, avoid this one and stick to the originals.",1181001600,3,1008,4.91764705882353
7922232,3,B00004T39Z,"I'm not entirely sure if I like this one or not. It seems to be missing something from the original Peanuts modus operandi. Maybe it's because we get to see and hear the adults. Maybe it's the river dancing mice. I understand it's Charlie reading to Sally, which is reminicent of the Garfield and Friends U.S. Acres when Orson reads to Wade, but it doesn't seem to have the same quality. It's always the last one my nephew and niece choose to watch when lined up against Charlie Brown's Valentines, Christmas, Halloween, America and Thanksgiving.",1178755200,2,546,4.757894736842105
