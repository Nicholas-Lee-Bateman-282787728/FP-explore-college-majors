8687297,5,B00PBGP37I,"I love that this DVD is divided into 20 minute segments, focusing on specific body parts and also focusing on specific fruits of the Spirit.  As a busy Mom, I can do as much or as little as I have time for.  I also love how Jesus-centered the content is and how it is saturated in the reading of Scripture.  It is a great spirit-refresher during my hectic days!  I have used many other prenatal yoga DVD's in the past, and this one tops them all.  I would recommend this DVD to any expecting moms!",1430784000,2,497,4.189473684210526
8687298,1,B00PBGP37I,"This ""Yoga"" DVD is beyond disappointing. The idea is great, and being almost 30 weeks pregnant, I was very excited to find a pre-natal Christian yoga video since I don't really like the idea of traditional yoga for what it stands for in its origins. I want to make clear that I grew up in a very strong, Christian home in which my dad was a pastor, and I take my faith very seriously. I don't want to come across as mean, or insensitive, but I feel like I have to write an honest review here so people know exactly what they are going to be spending $22 on. I know the creators meant well, and the actual biblical subject matter that it covers has great potential for something like this-- but everything about it is so poorly executed. The so-called ""yoga positions"" are nothing more than slight stretches that couldn't even challenge the most beginner or out of shape person. Most the time you are just sitting, standing, or even just LAYING there pretending to engage some muscle--it's beyond relaxing, and makes one want to fall asleep! It feels as though the coach is kind of improvising during each class which seems very unorganized. She over explains everything and is constantly talking, so that if you WANTED to try to mediate on the biblical portion, she is very distracting. Also, you never really do any ""pose"" or ""stretch"" more than once or for a challenging period of time. Everything is done very lazily, the video is very poor quality, the music is tiring and the whole thing is very un-motivating. This is not a workout or even a good stretching video. I wouldn't recommend this for the most out of shape person I know. The ""scriptural meditation"" portions are VERY brief and sort of stumbled over. She seldom tries to incorporate them throughout the classes, and when she does its just kind of weird and somehow doesn't work. I couldn't take it seriously at all. To be completely honest I feel like I was totally ripped of. I do hope this video can be helpful for some people, and based off it's reviews it looks like it is--but in my opinion, if you are younger than 90 years old and want to be even SLIGHTLY physically challenged, this is NOT the DVD for you. And unfortunately, the spiritual aspect of the DVD are not at all executed strongly enough.",1427241600,5,2272,4.54390243902439
8687299,5,B00PBGP37I,"Highly recommended this DVD! I am currently 25 wks and thought it might be difficult to do some yoga poses but I was wrong. The ladies provide excellent instructions on how to do/modify every move. I love the fact that I feel so relaxed and close to God. There are different segments you can choose from which I love as well. I have had a lot of lower back pain and this DVD has helped so much with relieving that pain. I would definitely recommend this to any mom who is expecting.

8687300,5,B00PBGP37I,"An amazing dvd where you get to accomplish so many things other than just a workout.  I felt closer to my baby, I felt closer to God, and it was amazing to help build my baby's relationship with the lord before he was ever born.  There are several different videos for different parts of your body and I could just do a few a day if I was having a day where I didn't have as much energy or I could do the whole workout if I was having a more energized day!  There were so many different positions so I was always comfortable!",1422662400,,525,4.028846153846154
8687301,5,B00PBGP37I,"Due with baby number 4 in a few weeks, and this yoga video is relaxing and great to help stretch out my body and get it ready for labor. I have several pregnancy induced ailments that I have to work around but was able to alter the yoga positions to make it suitable for me! Love that there are different segments to choose from that focus on different areas of the body and different Bible verses.",1421193600,,398,4.25
8687302,5,B00PBGP37I,"This is a great Yoga DVD.  Our baby is due in just a few weeks, and it really helped to follow these exercises to stretch and loosen up every area of the body.  I highly recommend it!",1420329600,,183,3.918918918918919
