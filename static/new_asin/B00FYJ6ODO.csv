To start, ""In Time"" exploits the concept that, in life, as humans, our most precious asset is TIME. It's true if you think about it. Time is more important than money...and if you interchange the two so that Time becomes currency, you begin to realize how important life / time is to us. Think about that song ""Cats in the Cradle"" by Harry Chapin or ""Your going to miss this"" by Trace Atkins, both songs talk about how time passes us by. Any way, I won't go on, but the reason this movie is worth watching, if for no other reason, is to help you realize that Time is extremely valuable...oh...and Justin Timberlake does a pretty good job as an actor too.

LIMITLESS: Talk about a ""make you think"" movie! This is one of those movies that gets you excited because it ""make you go hmmm""...you'll begin to imagine what it would be like if you could use 100% of your brain. Imagine remember what it was like in the womb! Or remember the sounds of your friend's voices when they were kids on your first day of kindergarten, or vividly remember the smell of the perfume your girlfriend was wearing and the taste of her lips on your first kiss! Or better yet, imagine if you could master the stock market in a day and become a millionaire overnight! You get the point...the pill...it just unlocks your mind's potential. Don't get hung up on the notion that its just the drug that's doing it, like some other reviewer. Lame. If all you could think about during the movie is that this guy was taking a drug and ""Drugs are bad mmmmkay..."" then, yeah, this movie is not for you. ""mmmmkay""....on a side note...if you did like this movie, than you should also see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucy/dp/B00QQW1VJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucy</a>",1444521600,3,1807,4.807073954983923
8619432,3,B00FYJ6ODO,"There are any number of criticisms to level at this. Do you want to believe in drugs that can make you better? OK, but then how can that be kept so controlled and secret? The side effects that seem to get others, but only touch the main character. The murder investigation that ends with minimal hassle.  It could have been darker, better, stronger. But it is worth a visit. Bradley Cooper is an excellent actor, so that alone makes it worth watching.",1438560000,,451,4.5
