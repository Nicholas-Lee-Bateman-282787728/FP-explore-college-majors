8335596,5,B001QFYJF0,Great DVD - very helpful for beginners.  Love the C4 products - would love to be trained by Brian Keaulana himself but seeing the watermen in action in this DVD was cool place to start.,1404691200,,185,4.285714285714286
8335597,5,B001QFYJF0,"Part I is way too basic, but still one thing or two can be learned.

Part II is filled with very specific stuff, tricks and techniques very well explained and demonstrated.

WARNING: If video quality is not an issue for you this video will be great for your collection.  Menu is really cheap home-made stuff.  Quality varies too much from scene to scene, some of the shots taken are very low definition and suddenly you see some HD stuff, this is kind of messy, but again if, like me, you only focus on the content, you'll love it.  You can definitely youtube all the content in here but not this well explained.",1397779200,,612,4.428571428571429
8335598,5,B001QFYJF0,I have been into SUPing for a few years now but have only tried flatwater and mild chop.  I am looking into trying some waves so I figured this DVD would have some good tips.  I cannot wait to try them on the water.,1396483200,,215,3.8636363636363638
8335599,5,B001QFYJF0,"The production quality is ok but the information is good.  I have surfed for a decade and wanted to start SUP'n so I picked up the DVD set after seeing some of their YouTube promotional videos.

The is a must have for SUP surfing beginners, definitely speed up my learning curve by months.  Now I can go out and rip in only a few months.  Well maybe not rip but have a great time :)",1354924800,,382,4.053333333333334
8335600,5,B001QFYJF0,"I ended up getting hooked on SUP after surfing, kiting and windsurfing-- watched many of Premier Productions movies they have produced over past 15 years- these guys are the best- their slogan ""we put you in the pilots seat"" is what has no doubt made them award winners...so was quite keen to get this series.

from the moment I pushed the play button on Vol. 1 to the end of Vol. 2 I felt I could SUP like a pro. Negatives- I felt the Equipment segment in Vol. 1 could be shorter. Pro's- Covers everything and more with great travel/ action segments in between the instruction. the multi camera angles from water, helmets and on board mounts is worth the entry fee- how do they get those amazing shots?

so stoked on this sport and the best thing is I now have my own Hawaain coach-- don't miss this series.",1265068800,6,808,4.38
8335601,5,B001QFYJF0,"I am an aging longboard surfer with knee problems, so got very excited watching all the SUP surfers on a recent trip to Kauai. After some researching for the best board and paddle I bought just the right one and brought it home. The next day was small surf (beach breaks) and relatively warm, so I took my new board out. After surfing for years, my image was falling off several times while I worked out the new balance issues and spending the next our paddling around - how hard could that be? I didn't even bother to put on my wetsuit and booties. The next hour and a half was a very humbling experience - repeatedly falling, climbing back on the board, awkwardly getting to my feet,  taking a few paddle strokes if lucky, and pitching into the water. That night I found Stand Up Paddle Surfing 101-301 and ordered it immediately. This two disc set takes you through every possible step from research and purchase, getting started, to proficient paddling and advanced surfing. Easy to follow, attractively demonstrated, humorous, always interesting - my best coach had arrived. I could see all the mistakes I was making, self correct and study the next level on the DVD until it was thoroughly researched in my mind. I still have a way to go, and I have an excellent coach to get me there.",1256601600,12,1291,4.540772532188841
