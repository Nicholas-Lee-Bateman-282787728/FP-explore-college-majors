187025,5,1568390882,"I own 5 other instructional Tai Chi DVDs. This one is my favorite. As with any new activity, frequent practice is essential. Joey Bond's style is addictive. The movements are displayed step by step repeatedly. The cadence of Bond's voice deepens Tai Chi's calming & revitalizing influence! Love it!",1185148800,,298,5.1020408163265305
187026,5,1568390882,"The first of the two tapes is a detailed teaching of each of the 24 forms, along with lecture about the history and philosophy of tai chi.  The second tape puts it all together, as you follow the entire sequence of forms in ""creative silence"".  The 70s costumes and hairstyles are a little distracting at first, but after a while you learn to ignore them as you follow the lovely, fluid movements.  I find this so relaxing after a stressful day.",1169510400,,445,4.469135802469136
187027,5,1568390882,"Great Tai Chi workout.  Joey Bond's DVD was recommended to me by a friend.  It is well done, easy to understand and follow.  Gave me a great workout.  Longer than I expected, too.",1167782400,2,179,4.333333333333333
187028,5,1568390882,"I like it.  Tai Chi can be a little  challeging in the beginning but, if you practice on a regular basis before you know it you'll be as good as Joey and the demonstrators in all 24 movements. Joey Bond is a Master in Tai Chi and a master instructor. The movements are designed to create harmony between the mind and body. You will feel invigorated not tired with each movement. It will leave you energized for the rest of the day.  No aches, no pains.",1156291200,7,452,4.232558139534884

7796929,5,1568390882,This is the 2nd DVD I have the first dvd,1486080000,,40,3.1
7796930,4,1568390882,"This is my second copy, I learned Tai Chi  from it many years ago and had lost the disks, so when I decided to brush up I ordered a new set.",1435276800,,140,3.5161290322580645
7796931,5,1568390882,This is a great DVD if you want to study the 24-move short form of the yang style of Tai Chi.  Joey Bond does a good job of explaining and demonstrating what he wants you to do.,1375574400,,177,3.7837837837837838
7796932,3,1568390882,"This is ok, but not great.  It's pretty dated, but the main thing is, this exercise takes A LOT of room, so you should be prepared for that.  I have a pretty large bedroom, and it's not big enough.  Other than that, it's ok, and pretty easy to follow.  I was disappointed not to be able to use it, as I had wanted to do this for several years.",1375488000,,343,3.927536231884058
7796933,5,1568390882,"This is a great way to learn Tai Chi especially if you live in a rural area. The step by step procedure is clear, concise and easy to follow. If you are wanting to learn Tai Chi this is an excellent way to go. I saw some other reviews that were not so good about this product (I bought the DVD but it also comes on VHS) I think it is an excellent product and would, and actually have, recommended it to family members.",1334534400,,418,3.988095238095238
7796934,5,1568390882,I first bought a dvd showing a few basic moves and realized I wanted to learn all the short form. I am very happy with this set of vhs.,1299715200,,135,3.689655172413793
7796935,5,1568390882,Joey Bond is a great instructor of Tai Chi.  Each movement is performed slowly and correctly so that it is remembered - a major problem for seniors.  The first movement can then be practised until it becomes automatic before moving on to the second movement and so on.  I would fully recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn Tai Chi in the privacy of their own home and at their own speed.,1238371200,,394,4.36986301369863
7796936,3,1568390882,"I purchased a $1 DVD at the store a couple years ago where Joey Bond masterfully teaches the first three (four if you count ""sink to the earth"") postures. Each session is about 25 minutes and is a great workout, after doing each posture for a time I felt like I could really master each one and even begin to combine them. My wife got me this set for Christmas because of how much I loved the other - same great teacher, but I miss the extended workouts and the episodic fortune cookie at the end of each exercise. Still worth the money and the effort, be be aware that if you are hoping for the same instruction as on the $1 disc, you are going to be disappointed.",1231632000,3,665,4.162790697674419
7796937,1,1568390882,"I've watched the episodes on PBS before. I was looking to get those episodes for my collection of Tai Chi Training. This is not what you might expect. The 30 minute lessons have been chopped up to about 6 minutes per. For this price I was really looking to get the whole thing, not an abreviated version. Don't get this if you're looking to train with the full episodes.",1222387200,8,370,4.3768115942028984
