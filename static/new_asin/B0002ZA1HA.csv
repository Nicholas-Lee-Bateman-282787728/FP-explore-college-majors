8035379,5,B0002ZA1HA,"THIS IMPORTANT DOCUMENTARY IS NOT FOR THOSE SEEKING ""NICE"" INFORMATION.

The time for a fact-based adherence to universal human values is overdue.

While I agree with the substance of Amazon reviews, characterizing this documentary as ""NICE"" reminds me of ""Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?"" For those new to American history, this classic ""joke"" about President Lincoln's assassination while he and his wife on 14 April 1865 were watching ""Our American Cousin"" at the Ford Theater in Washington is often used to demonstrate EXTREME insensitivity.

FACTS on ORIGINS of the faith-based 9/11 events are anything but nice. While the facts in ""Daughters of Afghanistan"" DVD are accurate, how can one restrain outrage at Afghan people earning two dollars (SIC) a month in the context of what the USA occupation costs? Estimates of costs for each soldier deployed in occupation of Afghanistan range from $800,000 on the low side to well over $1,000,000 a year! Fact Check this yourself. See over forty million (40,000,000) related google hits. To be fair and balanced, private contractors HAVE benefited greatly. $ $ But much of our so-called Afghanistan ""aid"" does NOT benefit average person. Quite the contrary.

Those liking women's status in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will LOVE Afghanistan.

Bush:""We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them."" Fifteen (15) of 9-11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia. Why were Saudi Arabia and Pakistan treated differently than Afghanistan? $ $ Why are primitive ""fundamentalist"" faith-based customs given a pass in these countries? Could it have something to do with oil? Inquiring minds want to know. Correct?

Women and girls continue to be executed by faith-based muslim fanatics in all three above counties with very weak - if any - objections by American spokesmen. WHY?

Reviewer and skilled analyst MaryAnn Johanson's says it all.

""Since the fall of the Taliban, Islamic fundamentalism has ""reasserted itself in a sinister way,"" according to Canadian journalist Sally Armstrong, and in this powerful, angry film she documents precisely how little has changed for women in that ravaged country. Through the eyes of four Afghani women -- including Dr. Sima Simar, who was, for a short time, a deputy prime minister in the new government until hardline Islamo-fascists demanded her removal, some going so far as to call for her death -- we see how women remain virtual sex slaves to their husbands (whom they are often forced to marry), why women remain afraid to walk the streets and are tormented by angry men even when wearing the burqa, and how entire generations of women continue to be denied basic personhood. Sure, schools for girls have tentatively reopened and women are allowed to drive again, but, Armstrong wonders, for how long? The human-rights disaster for women that occurred under the Taliban happened with full tacit approval of the rest of the world, and it seems destined to happen again under a new regime. Lots of newsy extras -- commentaries, interviews, profiles -vonly add to fuel to righteous fire."" Search ""MaryAnn Johanson"" for more.

IN CLOSING, PLEASE VIEW ""DAUGHTERS OF AFGHANISTAN"" AND TELL OTHERS ABOUT IT.

Meet the remarkable Dr. Sima Samar, a woman who defied the Taliban's brutal edicts and became briefly Deputy Prime Minister in the new government.

CAC's Comments:  This film clearly shows how women are treated in the Afghanistan and in the Middle East as a whole.  By watching this film, the viewer will learn about Dr. Sima Samar who is a very strong, brave and courageous woman.

8035381,5,B0002ZA1HA,"anyone should view this who is interested in the current political situation in afghanistan as well as the sufferation there, particularly of women. there is a book that goes along the same lines as this dvd by sally armstrong. she is a canadian who became interested and began advocating for the womens rights in afghanistan, and she has captured very well the situation as it really is. even in the removal of the taliban and the so-called liberation of women due to this, many people are still suffering, the burka is still being worn out of fear and tauting from men who disagree with any outside forces initiating changes in the country. follow the heartbreaking stories of women in afghanistan through the various personal stories that armstrong has covered in this documentary, and see for yourself the magnitude of the situation and the courage and strength of the woman to survive. the struggle continues on, and hopefully one day the people of afghanistan can find a peace and freedom they haven't had.",1110240000,11,1012,4.8895348837209305
