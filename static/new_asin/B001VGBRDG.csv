8346368,5,B001VGBRDG,"Let me be blunt up front-the reason for this review is specifically to counter the other, very odd, ""review"" that a seemingly disgruntled fan has attached to every one of these DVD's chronicling Memphis wrestling, primarily in the early to mid-80's. This look at Steve Keirn and Stan Lane, The Fabulous Ones, follows the trend set throughout the other volumes: great matches, terrific video quality on most, and most importantly, plenty of good stuff from the television tapings, which is where so much of the action happened in the good ol' days of Memphis rasslin'.

This DVD, like the others, is anchored by that most underrated of wrestling commentators, the great Lance Russell. With a demeanor impossible to dislike, and a voice as sincere and soothing as your own Grandfather's, Russell is the perfect guide. Although this particular set isn't near the top of the 'Memphis' heap (see ""Jerry Lawler vs Tommy Rich & Austin Idol"", ""Lawler vs. The Outside Invaders"", ""Jimmy Hart and the First Family"", many more), it's a fascinating look back at one of the truly great wrestling promotions of all time, back when wins and losses still actually meant something to the fans AND, often, competitors as well.",1312416000,,1207,4.975247524752476
8346369,1,B001VGBRDG,"A little confused after buying the entire series of these DVDs. I thought they were going to be from master tapes or really good quality. Turns out, these are just from all the usual tapes circulating in the wrestling trade community. Nothing new here. really disappointed.",1287273600,,273,4.956521739130435
