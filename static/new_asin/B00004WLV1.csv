1366818,5,B00004WLV1,"It has some funny moments, especially when all hell breaks loose during the dance. Everyone scattering because of the police showing up, the glue pranks, the almost sex moments; it all resembles movies like Animal House and even American Pie. The subtle humor is sometimes better than the obvious jokes. Although I wish it had more of what the title implies, as far as comical, it's definitely worth watching more than once.  The meatballs that acted more like rubber dancing balls than meatballs, was hilarious.",1392076800,,512,5.023529411764706

Joy of Sex (1984) **
D: Martha Coolidge
C: Cameron Dye, Michelle Meyrink, Colleen Camp, Ernie Hudson Ernie Hudson, Lisa Langlois, Charles Van Eman Charles Van Eman, Paul Tulley, Joe Unger, Christopher Lloyd
P: A teenager, who mistakenly believes she has six weeks to live, makes it her mission to lose her virginity.

I love a good ole sex comedy. The good ones find that balance between being a screwball comedy and bringing back nostalgic memories of having to navigate through the world of sex as a teenager, the perils and confusion of it all.

For a movie with a title like Joy of Sex, it's quite surprising that there is little joy and little sex. Now, I will give them this. Trying to translate Alex Comfort's sex manual into a big screen movie was near to next to impossible. The characters in Joy of Sex glance at the manual here and there as they make their way through the world of teen sexuality, but the manual itself and the movie don't interact with one another enough.

There's a good idea in there somewhere. If the film had played up more to the idea of having the characters read the Joy of Sex manual and then trying to recreate what they have just read, it would have resulted in a truly hilarious film.

Overall, the film suffers from its tame approach and failing to commit to the film's overall premise. Most of that blame falls squarely on the shoulders of director Martha Coolidge, who cut the film's racier elements and, in the process, strayed far away from what Paramount had envisioned this film to be during filming. [R] 93 mins. -- AKA: National Lampoon's Joy of Sex",1387238400,,1667,4.63728813559322
1366820,5,B00004WLV1,"when i was a kid i saw this move on VHS and we all died laughing i hope you will to it all but its funn as hell

try it see if you like it i am sure ya will find it funny",1366329600,,170,2.953488372093023
1366821,4,B00004WLV1,"This film deserves better. Granted, it has suffered on several levels, from being tied to a title of a book that it had nothing to do with, to John Belushi's death prior to filming. All of this is unfortunate, as a lot of people go into this film expecting something that it was never meant to be. Plus the poor editing certainly doesn't help.

All that aside, what we're left with is a pretty decent 80's teen comedy along the lines of Better Off Dead, Weird Science and The Last American Virgin. Though not as classic as the above titles, it shares a lot of the same elements, and has plenty to offer to fans of the genre: some great lines, some genuinely funny scenes, a flashback to that 80's American high school experience that's embarrassingly perceptive enough to still ring true, and the great underrated Michelle Meyrink.

It is seriously overdue for DVD release.",1274140800,4,873,4.625806451612903
1366822,4,B00004WLV1,"Wow, I don't know where to start. I love this movie and it's the little things that make it shine. It's one of those movies where you watch the background characters and action.

Examples: the ""wacky glue"" phantom who glues dildos in the trophy case, teacups on the chest of a Venus d'milo replica, and a urinal to the door of the principal's office. (Which the foreign exchange student later uses!)

The ""Blue Flamers"" that meet at the drive-in and then after long descriptions of the gaseous foods they ate, proceed to light their - er ""wind"".

When Leslie, the female lead, is babysitting with her 12 year old sister and the sister finds a vibrator and asks what it is for. Leslie tells her it is for ""curling your hair."" and in the background we see her sister try to curl her hair.

At the winter dance, after hints of how bad the food from the club is -- we see a tray of meatballs being carried by one of the sub-characters. When the meatballs fall off the tray they BOUNCE like little rubber balls across the floor.

Christopher Lloyd and Collen Camp are fun to watch. I wish Jeanne Mori could have made it big, she's a hoot as the dead-pan Sunshine.

The little one-liners and sight gags continue through the entire movie. I really wish this was available on DVD. Watch it once if you get the chance, relax and have a bit of fun.",1245715200,5,1338,4.375
1366823,3,B00004WLV1,"The only connection here to the esteemed book is that our main (and desperate) character Alan (Cameron Dye) keeps a well thumbed copy with him in class.  He pines for Leslie (Michelle Meyrink) who's considered off-limits because her father (Christopher Lloyd) is the overprotective lethal wrestling coach.  Leslie is looking to ""score"" also - she misunderstands her doctor and thinks she only has a few months to live.  Subplots revolving around Alan and Leslie's attempts to ""lose it"" include a confused exchange student from Mecca and an undercover policewoman (Colleen Camp) who's looking to bust a student named ""Mushroom"" Malone.  Formula teen comedy offers some laughs and originality - not to mention a ""fart lighting"" contest.",987638400,9,734,5.301724137931035
