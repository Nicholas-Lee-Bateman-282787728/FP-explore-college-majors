8156413,3,B000KGGNCI,"First off, this DVD contains absolutely no extras.  Toss it in the player and the show starts. It has no menu, no audio options, and no subtitles, just the show.  I just bought this single episode, and was a bit surprised that there was not even a menu.

I bought this episode because I was interested to get a bit more information about Iceal ""Gene"" Hambleton, or Bat-21.  I had just read Bat-21, by William Charles Anderson.  The show actually doesn't involve Gene very much.  It's mostly about the decision making process that the military went through in order to rescue Bat-21 and the other downed pilots in the area.

It seems to be a pretty good overview of the rescue from everyone's perspective except Gene's.  He had passed away by the time this show ran in 2006, but I was still somewhat disappointed that there was not more information from and about him.",1205712000,,867,4.584415584415584
