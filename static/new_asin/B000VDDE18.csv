2936650,5,B000VDDE18,I bought these DVD's for my wife for Christmas. She has certainly enjoyed them. As well as myself. I would give these DVD's a five star rateing.,1199750400,,144,4.37037037037037
2936651,2,B000VDDE18,"I have to say that I was a little disappointed with this ""set"".  I expected it to be a true ""boxed set"" when in reality, it is all the dvd's from each season in plastic wrap.  I know that is what the picture shows, but it said it wasn't out yet - to be released December 13, in time for Christmas etc...it was a little deceiving.  I gave it to my sister for Christmas (she already had seasons one and two) and now she has the exact same thing repeated.  It is Fraiser and all, but I expected a little more.  Why was there a ""release date""?  They basically took all the individual seasons and wrapped them together.  Like I said, a little disappointed.",1199145600,36,651,4.201612903225806
2936652,5,B000VDDE18,"This is the essential collection for any Frasier fan (i.e. intelligent human being).  This set includes every season of the show bound in the original release format rather than in one cramped, clumsy case as many series collections are now being released (such as Star Trek TNG).

Frasier has been one of the most critically acclaimed sitcoms in history, winning the majority of emmys for comedy in a television show.  Even combined, Friends (which I love) and Seinfeld (which I hate) could not claim half as many emmys as Frasier.

So the critics like it?  Big deal, it matters what each viewer wants.  If you would like a smart comedy with intelligent jokes and plots, then this is for you.  If you want stupid laughs, buy Family Guy.  Though the series does bog down towards the end, as most sitcoms do after 9 or 10 seasons, the characters are still likeable and interesting enough for the viewer to continue watching.

This set is a great value, and at less than $20 per season no less!",1196726400,8,992,4.622857142857143
2936653,5,B000VDDE18,"will this be coming out in a special box set like friends, Raymond and King of Queens or is this just the 10 seperate seaon boxes that can be purchased individually??",1196121600,,166,4.387096774193548
2936654,5,B000VDDE18,"When Kelsey Grammer first introduced himself to Sam Malone as psychiatrist Frasier Crane on ""Cheers"" back in 1984, who would have believed that this television character would tie James Arness'  Matt Dillon at twenty years of playing the same TV character? ""Frasier"" could hardly be called a sequel to ""Cheers"", though, in spite of guest appearances by alumni of that show that appeared pretty regularly in the early years. Frasier's new job on a radio show combined with his neurotic family and friends were a perfect setting for Frasier's trademark sarcasm and biting wit. The show seemed to lose a little steam around the time that Niles' pining away for Daphne actually became a relationship at the end of season seven through the middle of season eight, but the show could have perhaps overcome that had it not been for the tragic death of David Angell on September 11, 2001. Angell was the mastermind behind some of the funnier episodes of ""Cheers"", the creator of the series ""Wings"", and he was the creative force behind ""Frasier"". It just seemed like the show ran out of steam for a couple of seasons after Angell's death, but then came roaring back in its eleventh and final season. That's not to say that seasons nine and ten were bad seasons by network TV standards, they just weren't up to my expectation levels considering how funny and creative the show had been over past years. ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" got more press and had a bigger fan base during the 90's, but Frasier consistently delivered the laughs over the years with a refined and elegant style of humor.

Finally I also have to say that I personally loved the character of Eddie from the moment he was introduced on the show after it was decided Martin, Frasier's dad, would be moving in with him. Frasier and Martin are having words over Eddie's presence because Frasier claims ""Eddie stares at me"". Expecting Eddie to be some older male acquaintance, in the next scene I was quite surprised to see Frasier being stared at by Eddie - Martin's Jack Russell terrier. The little dog had a personality of his own and just wasn't window dressing in the series, having a major impact in more than a few episodes and getting more fan mail than any other character on the show. I don't think anyone could call ""Frasier"" groundbreaking, but I think its humor will stand the test of time and it did manage to deliver the laughs and the heart creatively and intelligently for eleven seasons, which is a pretty big accomplishment.",1188864000,163,2496,4.735632183908046

2936697,1,B000VDDE18,"After viewing the first five seasons, I cannot recommend this product.  There are numerous flaws in the video where the picture just goes black and about 30 seconds of the program is missing.  This occurs on numerous episodes, sometimes at the beginning and other times later in the episode.
There is no closed captioning available.  The packaging is compact but the disks are almost impossible to extract from the case.  I finally had to use a wooden dowel to facilitate the removal of the disks. Some disks have commercials at the beginning which can be fast-forwarded through.  But this is not acceptable for purchased disks.  The only positive comment I can make is that the price is very reasonable considering the number of disks in the set.  Then again, based on all the problems with the set, there is probably a good reason for that.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frasier-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00S89IRH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frasier: The Complete Series</a>",1522713600,2,1019,5.708609271523179

2936716,1,B000VDDE18,"Fraiser, Fraiser, Fraiser... what did they do to you...

I want to make it clear that I love the show itself - this review is not about that. This review is about the dvd set, which... I think calling this set ""lazy"" might be far too generous. Whoever made this set either didn't have a darned clue what they were doing, or else actively hates Fraiser and wants to ruin it for anyone who got this DVD set.

First, the box set itself is very cheap and things change at almost random. For example, you don't have the ""play all"" feature, meaning you have to start every episode on every disc manually. Until Season 4, when play all is randomly added.  There also aren't special features... in season one, but they suddenly show up in season two. The DVD menus won't allow me to turn captions on, though forcing them on through the PS3's (my preferred choice of dvd/bluray player) system menus does work - almost as if someone wanted to take the captions out but simply disabled the button rather than actually remove them. Seriously, it's almost like every season was made by a different company entirely, and whoever released this box set just stuffed them all into a box and called it a day rather than standardizing them all.

But the biggest problem of all is the horrific VHS-level picture quality. It seriously looks like my old VCR from the 90s could match these DVDs in quality. I can literally SEE the individual lines of the interlacing, because they couldn't be bothered to even de-interlace it, much less give a full remastering as a series of this caliber deserves. Except season 10 (and 11) are somehow in much better quality then everything else, almost as though a completely different person did them... or maybe, it's that Seasons 10 and 11 were originally filmed at higher resolutions and when these bozos did their cut 'n' paste job, the higher quality was copied too.

So, if you're planning on watching Fraiser on the same TV you used to watch it when it was still on the air, then go for it. But if you even dare watch this on any sort of remotely modern television, then I hope you have an armada of expensive upscalers, because that's the only way the first nine seasons are going to be watchable.",1516492800,3,2219,4.551378446115288
2936717,5,B000VDDE18,"I waited a long time to add this to my collection but it was well worth the wait. I started at the beginning and before I knew it I was binge watching. I saw episodes I had never seen before. It was a day of laughter. If you are a fan of Frazier or in need of a belly laugh, this is a must have. I highly recommend.",1516233600,,315,3.6470588235294117
2936718,5,B000VDDE18,"This is the one sitcom that I can watch over and over. It is still my favorite sitcom to this day. I enjoy Community, Big Bang Theory, and especially Plebs. However, Frasier is smarter and more humorous than all of these combined.",1515369600,,230,4.5
2936719,1,B000VDDE18,"I love this series and really want it, but I can't get a working disc set. The first set I ordered on sale in December 2017 had a bad first disc. It was unreadable in two different Blu-ray players. Cleaning the disc didn't improve anything. I quickly exchanged the set for a replacement set. While the replacement set's first disc was somewhat readable, the disc would freeze, skip, and pixilate during the episodes. Cleaning the disc didn't help it either.

You cannot get replacement discs for just the defective discs---you have to return the entire set for replacement. Since the first disc in both sets was defective, I didn't bother to check any other discs in the sets because the whole set has to go back. I would have been willing to try one more replacement set in an attempt to get a working set, but Amazon didn't offer replacement after the second set, only refund. So I've settled for returning the last set for a refund. I really wish I could get a working set, but that doesn't appear to be possible.

If you've recently purchased this set or received it as a gift, check it as quickly as you can, before it's too late to return it. And at the first sign of trouble, return it immediately. There's no point in continuing with the rest of the discs, and you'll wind up stuck with a defective set.

Once I unwrapped it I saw that both cases (it is broken up into seasons 1-6 and 7-11) were cracked on the side.  When I put the discs in, the menu screen looked so archaic.  There is not even an option to Play All; you have to select each episode one by one!

The DVD's of the first couple of seasons were very good but by the 6th season it was so frustrating to get a disc to play at all, let alone play with periodic interruptions/freezes/gargles, I decided to find some other way to enjoy once again ""Frasier"".

Not having watched the sitcom in real time, I was happy to find it complete, where I could watch the shows a disk at a time, flying through the years.  For the most part, Frasier was consistently funny.  But some of the shows tended to drag when they repetitiously dealt with Frasiers vain attempt at romance.  The setup was exactly the same every time.  Frasier would throw himself at a woman, make a fool of himself, screw up any chance he had at a relationship............and then do it again, and again, and again.  After multiple setups, exactly the same, this ceased to be amusing.  And they kept this up for eleven years!
Other than that, Frasier was one of the better sitcoms to grace television.",1492300800,3,767,4.554744525547445

All of the other discs played flawlessly.  Given the price of this set I'm very happy with that track record.  And I like the cases that the DVD's come in, very compact yet they do a good job protecting the discs.  I'd forgotten how good the show was although it did get a bit tedious in the final years, especially the Frasier character.  The writing and comedy is far beyond anything that has come before or since.  You just can't get more bang for your buck than with this set.",1492300800,4,631,4.387931034482759

2936812,5,B000VDDE18,"Watching Cheers was a weekly ritual for my friends and me growing up. We would all gather at one of our houses and watch Cheers on a Friday evening (I grew up in the UK), then head out to a party or club. When I heard they were doing a spin off of Frasier, I wasn't overly enthused. I liked his character in Cheers, but there were much stronger characters such as Cliffy Clavin, Carla, Rebecca, etc. that I thought would have been better for a spin off. Boy, how I was wrong!

Frasier the series was simply comedy perfection for me. It is over 20 years since the show ended, and I still tape the re-runs on the various channels to re-watch episodes that I have seen numerous times already. When I saw that there was a sale on the complete series, I had to grab it so I could free up all that space on my DVR!

I won't go into a detailed analysis of what makes this show so great as there are many others that can articulate its many strengths far better than I can. However, there are two particular elements of the series that endear it to my heart...

1. I love how the ""will they, won't they?"" romance between Daphne and Niles was so well drawn out over the first 5 years or so. When they did finally get together, I expected the show to take turn for the worse (anyone remember Moonlighting?), however if anything it got better! If anyone knows of a series where a romance was handled better, please let me know, as for me this was the best handling of true love that I can ever remember seeing on a TV screen.

2. I love how the relationship between Frasier and his father develops over the entire series from a very strained relationship to one that I envy. My father loves me a lot and I love my father a lot. However I wish he and I had the kind of relationship that Frasier and Martin developed over the 11 series. I am now a father myself, and as well as doing everything I possibly can for my two daughters, I also am trying to be a more affectionate and approachable parent so my children will know who I am as a person and what values I have, as well as knowing that their Daddy loves them very much.

Anyway, enough of the self psycho-analysis! Frasier is a timeless comedy that seems even better with age, especially when I compare it with the comedy shows of today.",1480032000,2,2281,4.2105263157894735

2936836,4,B000VDDE18,"I won't go into the series at all - one of my all time favorites, some of the most intelligent comedy I've ever seen on TV.  Phenomenal characters who were fleshed out and grew as the story went on.  Something that doesn't happen often.  It's as great now more than 2 decades after it began as it was at the time.

But I really have to give props for the cases.  I absolutely LOVE this, more than just about any other disc set I have of any show or series.  Large books, and every ""page"" has a disc on each side, so you simply go from one page to the next.  NONE of the junk I hate, like discs UNDER other discs.  Nothing nested here, each one has its own page.

I've had no issues with any of the discs so far, video and sound are very good quality.

And to get all this for this price?  Insane.  Can't get better value than this.

Only reason I took a star off is because the same time (season 4) they introduce a ""play all"" is when you hit the annoying commercials that you can't skip through.  All input is greeted with the red circle and you have to sit through them trying to sell you more DVD's for other shows...",1471478400,4,1120,4.054794520547945

The only thing I would like to talk about is the subtitles.  OK, I really do not know the difference between subtitles and captioning.  I know this is supposed to be simple, but it is not for me.  What we do is turn on the individual menu on our blu-ray player.  We then go to the subtitle menu and it works.  I think because of our player the font size is a bit smaller and I really do not have much success in getting it bigger. So, anyway if your player supports an option for subtitles this set will do it for you.  I need it because of being hearing impaired and cannot keep up with the dialog with out it.  In short we love Frasier and we can get subtitles with our blu-ray player.",1470096000,5,813,4.127388535031847
2936839,5,B000VDDE18,My all time favorite comedy.  I watched it years ago when I was a young teen and always remembered how good it was.  I finally decided to splurge and buy the DVD set. It's timeless....you can watch an episode from years ago and it still holds up...still brilliantly funny.  All the actors are given a chance to shine and are given their share of funny lines. Such a great ensemble.  I loved Niles and Daphne.  The episode where she ran away from her wedding and jumped into the RV with Niles was absolute perfection.  And of course the back and forth banter between Frasier and Niles was comedy gold. Loved them together.  I wish that those two actors would star in another series together someday.

The sleeves that the DVDs are held in are not actually connected to the case, which makes little sense to me.

Kelsey Grammar and David Hyde Pierce are remarkable and hilarious as Frasier and Niles Crane. Plus, the characters are so relatable! The only downside is that there were no subtitles available,  and due to allergies my hearing had declined significantly, so I had to hike the volume up, and there was no gag reel, but those aren't reasons to rate the show lower.  I never tire of this show and no matter how many times I watch, I still laugh until I'm in tears. This was truly one of the best shows to grace television.",1463875200,6,679,4.373015873015873

We watch this on the channels that carry it, but often important moments are cut, either for commercial time or for peculiar ""moral"" reasons I won't even try to explain.  This is one of those shows that was great from beginning to end, and each episode is like watching a play in few acts.  The characters have intelligent conversations, the brilliant cast meshes perfectly together, and the plots are engaging and very funny.  At its best, ""Frasier"" is top notch.

2936875,1,B000VDDE18,"Let me preface all this by stating that FRASIER is an absolute brilliant, top notch, outstanding, superb comedy series -- and that's an understatement. The program itself has earned all the accolades it has garnered over the years. Its warmth and humanity are timeless.

It pains me to rate this entry one star and trust this review will not drag down the title's rating.

But the packaging of this set leaves much room for improvement. The entire 44 DVDs are housed in two huge, turn-the-page, rather unwieldy volumes to say the least. What were they thinking?

The UK release (Region 2 / PAL) was done *way* better years ago --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frasier-Seasons-1-11-2009-Kelsey-Grammer-Jane-Leeves-Moose/dp/B002D3ZJD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frasier - Seasons 1 - 11 (2009) Kelsey Grammer; Jane Leeves; Moose</a>&nbsp;-- with elegance and simplicity as befits the crowd at Cafe Nervosa. The UK set design presents each season in its own unit. Each unit unfolds giving immediate access to each disc mounted in its own section. It's easy to access and easy to handle. And each season has its own graphics scheme.

This 'new' DVD set is simply a repackaging of the previously available DVDs -- if you have those,  be mindful there's no new content here.

As a National Treasure, the entire FRASIER series needs to be remastered to Blu-ray -- it was filmed in spherical 35mm -- with, if possible, more extras! It's a quality series that deserves a quality release.",1459382400,4,1523,5.405063291139241

2936922,5,B000VDDE18,"Loved Frasier when it was first shown on TV and couldn't wait for the next weekly episode.  This boxed set was a gift and it's just as funny as i remember. I'm so pleased. The  writers' have everything just right.  The early relationship between Frasier and his dad; their differences and Frasier/Niles wondering how can he be their dad when he doesn't like the finer things in life. Great writing and so true to life.  Frasier's self-importance, his referring to himself as attractive, his snobbishness, his flaws and other characters bringing him down to earth. Niles comes into his own and his character is hilarious with his doting on Daphne. Just watched the episode where she's cooking and he joins her in the kitchen. He tries to pull himself up on the worktop to sit but as he is a weakling  (standing joke re the Crane boys) he hits his head on the extractor fan.............the rest is a very funny scene. Daphne has some great lines. When asked Daphne, that's a nice name. Do they call you Daffy for short? She replies 'Not twice'.

Only negatives are the actor playing Martin does tend to overact, as does, as does Kelsey G at times.  Also not sure why extremely attractive women, mostly models (!) are cast as  Frasier's girlfriends. Oh and his early haircut! Other than it's still laugh out loud funny with brilliant writing.  Nearly forgot; Millicent Martin is very, very funny in the later episodes.",1447632000,2,1415,4.719512195121951

2936938,5,B000VDDE18,"I am one of those people who has no life except for television and movies. I liked this show in it's original airing  years ago, but I have fallen in love with the show  all over again. This is my favorite show. Every character is a character, rich, deep and acted perfectly. The chemistry  is unequaled. I don't know if actors realize what they bring to the lives of viewers, but often when many of us are feeling low, for whatever reason, we just want to laugh, get away from the world. Frasier does that for me. My favorite character on the show is David Hyde Pierce's character Niles Crane. His character, though original, is akin to Don Knott's Andy Griffith character Barney Pfife. Both characters are giants of the television screen and their respective shows. The miniature nuances, acted to perfection,  made Pierce's character, Niles, a critical component of the show. Pierce was nominated 10 or 11 times out of the 11 years the show ran for an Academy Award for the character for best supporting actor in a comedy. He won 4 or 5 times. That is quite an accomplishment. Frasier is one of the best comedies of all time. In it's original run it was hidden on Thursday nights behind other giant comedies. Now in reruns, it stands alone. I have purchased the entire series. It is a laugh fest, each and every show. One of the best things about the show is the jokes were written evenly amongst all the characters. This truly was an ensemble show. Grammar was the star, but he was not the dominant character.  Kelsey Grammar was a welcome addition to Cheers. Peri Gilpin left a memorable mark on me, when she did one episode on another of my favorite shows:Wings. She had that special quality, in an actor that you cannot manufacture.  I love all of the characters on Frasier. The Moons should have had a show of their own. The Simon character was a riot, as was Daffney's mother and father. Her brothers were very funny. I loved this show. I would like to thank all the actors, writers, producers, directors and anyone  who had anything to do with Frasier. Your contributions to turning a frown around are greatly appreciated . You are all artists. Picassos of the industry.",1443398400,5,2180,4.5886889460154245

2936965,4,B000VDDE18,"Love the show.  Niles/David Hyde Pierce's love for Daphne was a particular highlight.  It was a love story I wanted to believe in.  And most of all, I loved both the characters.

Niles's character is a revelation.  He was weak, neurotic, and fussy, and his love for Daphne so pure.  It made him attractive and endearing.  And Daphne/Jane Leeves was eccentric, sweet, innocent; she was the perfect foil for Niles Crane. I really loved Daphne.  She was such an attractive character - always empathetic and interesting, even when she was esasperating to the rest of the characters.  But that was the beauty of Jane Leeves, who could make Daphne so wonderfully empathetic. You also understood Niles's attraction.  I wanted Niles to continue to lust, to continue to be in love, and I wanted him to succeed.  Niles's was so smitten, he would forget himself.  Niles's would say something strange or wanton, and Daphne's plaintive face was comedy in itself.  She was just so naive.  All her benign comments to Niles were just fuel for the fire.  I rooted for them.  Niles's adoration was so earnest, and Daphne's oblivion was beautiful comedy.  I especially cherished when Daphne discovers Niles's love for her, she is bothered by it, quite tormented even.  But at the party, there is that glance, and you can see her falling in love.  (So unlike her reaction when she thought Fraiser might be in love with her.  She and Niles always had chemistry.)

I like Fraiser.  He was pompous, and I don't always agree with him but he was still good a person, though misguided.

I was a loyal watcher of the show, but as the show went on, it lost its edge.

It wasn't Niles and Daphne's newfound love that ruined the show.  But the fact that the show didn't stay true to itself.

Is Daphne's family interesting?  No, especially Simon, who was just irritating.  I detested the slapstick comedy that the show resorted to.  Simon wasn't just uninteresting, but he was painful to watch.  In fact, it made the show unbearable, and even denigrated Daphne, because she could not stand up to her brothers, and she was lost.  Daphne's mother wasn't any better.  It changed the tone of the series, made it more slapstick.  The charm of the show was Fraiser and Niles's absurd aspirations and mannerism, and that was replaced by the crude and annoying.

Did I like Roz/Peri Gilpin sleeping with Bulldog?  No.  Disgusting.  Roz was sexually adventurous but I really loathed that storyline.  It was humiliating for the character.  Roz should have many men in her thrall.  Though particularly endearing was her love for her daughter.

And Dr. Phil?  A tabloid showpiece.  The snob in Dr. Fraiser Crane would find Dr. Phil odious and repellent, a mockery to the profession.  So it was mindboggling to see Fraiser kowtowing.  It was an insult to fans and an utter betrayal of the character.  I was aghast.  I actually stopped watching Fraiser on network after that episode.

This is a great show.  But it lost its way.  And its missteps undermined the whole series.  So I forget that they even exist.

Still the early seasons were so wonderful.  Niles's love of Daphne.  Fraiser adjusting to living with his dad.  Their anecdotes about Maris.  Maris is a wondrous character.  From being buried in other people's coats at a party; her webbed hands, her extreme thinness, then her great billowing weight et cetera.

So many good things about the show, such that it really hurt when it stepped out of place.",1434758400,,3470,4.755480607082631

The only issue I have with this series and the reason I didn't give it a five star review is that I did have an issue with one of the discs.  It was defective and since there are so many of them, it is impossible to watch them all within the 30 day return policy.  If you do find yourself with a defective disc, you have no recourse as far as getting it replaced or returned.  That is a problem since I am only half way through the first years and my fear is that I am going to have more issues once I get through the entire set.

Niles is the snooty psychiatrist who is also a neat freak and later in the show falls in love with Frasiers live in helper Dalphne Moon played by Jane Leeves.  She's a eccentric psychic who can predict things but they don't really come true..

Characters in Order

Frasier Crane - Refined, pompous, uptight and upper-middle class, Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) is a psychiatrist living in Seattle, Washington. He is the eldest son of Martin and Hester Crane. Both Frasier and his younger brother Niles graduated from Harvard Medical School with degrees in psychiatry and the siblings are highly competitive. Frasier is the host of The Dr. Frasier Crane Show"" on KACL 780 AM radio in Seattle which is produced by his friend and confidant Roz Doyle.

Roz Doyle -  Kind, witty and down-to-earth, Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin) is the producer of Dr. Frasier Cranes radio show on KACL 780AM in Seattle.
She is originally from Bloomer, Wisconsin and has one older sister named Denise. Roz dates frequently and is teased by both Frasier and Niles for being sexually promiscuous. In particular, Niles gives Roz a very hard time about her dating life. She, in turn, mocks Niles for being such an elitist snob.

Dalphne Moon - Kind-hearted and caring, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves) is a native of Manchester, England and the only daughter of Gertrude and Harry Moon. She has eight brothers including her always annoying and often drunk brother ,Simon, her gay brother, Billy, and her favorite brother, Stephen. Daphne is hired by Frasier Crane to be the live-in housekeeper and Martins physical therapist. She lives with both men in Frasiers Seattle apartment and although she is a terrible cook both men rely on her. Daphne shares a special friendship with Frasiers brother Niles, who is immediately smitten with the completely unaware Daphne.

Martin Crane - No-nonsense, pragmatic and unassuming, Martin Crane (John Manhoney) is the father of Frasier and Niles Crane. He was married to the Hester Crane for more than 30 years before she passed away. He was a detective in the Seattle Police Department but was forced to retire after being injured on the job. A bullet is lodged in his left hip which causes him to walk with a cane. Although Daphne helps care for him, Martin is very independent and doesn't like to have to rely on anyone. He is rarely seen without his beloved dog Eddie.

Dr Niles Crane -  Brilliant and persnickety, Dr. Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce) is the younger brother of Dr. Frasier Crane and the son of Martin and Hester Crane. He is married to Maris Crane and is the uncle of Frederick Crane. He was born and raised in Seattle and continues to reside there.

Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe (Dan Butler) lives in Seattle and works at KACL radio station alongside Frasier and Roz. He is the host of the ""Gonzo Sports Show,"" one of the station's most popular shows. He is rude and loves to insult his listeners, his interview subjects and pretty much anyone else who crosses his path. He is particularly fond of mocking Frasier because the men have so little in common. Bulldog is a huge womanizer but also has an unrequited crush on Roz. He can frequently be heard uttering the phrase, ""This stinks!"" whenever anything doesn't go his way or he can't locate something

Finally Eddie! The beloved pup to Martin Crane who claims he is his best friend..",1432252800,3,3720,4.743034055727554

It seemed to be a one gag show, the slimy bartender, girls who for some reason fall over themselves for him, a waitress who would have been fired elsewhere, etc. That is why I never watched Frasier when it aired. later I tried a few on the Hallmark Channel out of boredom and found it is not Cheers. Frasier and his brother are psychiatrists in Seattle, and the writing is wonderful, Fraser and Niles being snooty and arrogant but totally lovable. Their father lives with Frasier and he's a funny guy, even his dog has a personality. Lilith from Cheers shows up in some episodes, as does Sam Malone and Diane.

2937012,5,B000VDDE18,"""Frasier"" is my all time favorite sitcom, so when I saw it at this price I had to have it.  I had been waiting for YEARS for a deal like this so I was willing to take a chance on the image quality, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not quite as good as broadcast TV but it's only by a smidgen - Not enough to be upset about given the price.  I'm pretty sure that if I fiddled enough with my TV settings I could make it every bit as good.  I am loving the fact that I can change the aspect ratio on my TV settings to see it in both 4:3 and 6:9.  Fortunately my TV has a setting to stretch the image to 6:9 without distorting it too much.  No one looks stretched out or fat.  Of course the image isn't quite as sharp, but not by much.  I can't vouch for how this would look on other TVs but my guess from previous experience is that it can vary with the TV and how well it handles stretching the image.  Unfortunately, ""Frasier"" was not filmed in 6:9 so if you own a widescreen TV no matter what version you get you have to deal with the stretching issue if you don't want to see the ""bars"" on either side of the image.  Perhaps there is a version out there that has been remastered for 6:9 but if so I have personally never seen that and don't know if it's any better than this version stretched out with my TV settings.  If this set had been as expensive as other sets of this series I might have been disappointed, but given the great price, I'm ecstatic.",1429142400,3,1460,4.0

Modern Family may be King of the American Sitcoms now, but in the 90s it was Frasier, a spin-off from the popular sitcom Cheers starring Kelsey Grammer as a pompous but endearing psychologist who reveled in his intellect and haute culture tastes, but also yearned to be one of the guys. Frasier won a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series for each of its first five seasons and continued to win Emmys in other categories for all of its 11 seasonsthough it wasn't a runaway hit with audiences. Its best showing came with Season 6, when Frasier finished as the #3 most watched TV show in America, behind Friends and ER.

In Bostons Cheers bar, Grammer made arrogance endearing as he played a good-but-jilted doctor who hung out with a dim-witted Iowa bartender, a narcissistic ex-ballplayer, a know-it-all mailman, and an overweight, professional barfly. Sometimes you laughed with him, while at other times (most of the time, actually) the humor came at the doctor's expensea book smarts vs. street smarts face-off. In Seattle, fresh from a divorce from his domineering wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth), Frasier found a fresh start as a Dr. Phil-style radio psychologist and acquired a new hangout: Caf Nervosa, where he and equally effete brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) would indulge their cappuccino tastes and parade their knowledge in front of a generally apathetic public.

The show, with chapter tiles that played with puns, had two main sets. The first was KACL-Radio, where Frasier dispensed his psychiatric bromides and producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin) was a perfect ""give it a rest"" foil to his pompous side. Obnoxious sportscaster Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe (Dan Butler) took him down a few more pegs with his cuts and practical jokes, and restaurant critic Gil Chesterton (Patrick Kerr) was the uncomfortable mirror that showed reflections of what Frasier might be like without such irreverent and frequent shots to keep him grounded. Much of the at-work time is spent with Frasier talking to unseen call-ins with a host of problems, and much of the fun for fans is watching the end-credits to see what famous celebrities posed as the callers from week to week.

At home, the brandy-oriented Frasier met his match with his blue-collar dad (John Mahoney), a Ballantine-loving ex-cop who walks with a limp and has a live-in therapist, a Brit named Daphne (Jane Leeves). With dad and son facing off and Daphne offering her humorous third-party, third-culture take on things, it made for more dry humor. And Niles visited so often that it felt as if the four of them lived . . . and bantered there.

The Crane brothers were American bluebloods without the pedigree, lovers of the good life who aspire to be accepted by high society. It was their continuing lack of acceptance by the true snobs that make those of us in the hoi polloi tickle inside. The humor is mostly verbal and as highbrow as the Crane brothers, though average viewers identified with the lowbrows in each episode that cut them down to size.

Thats what CBS TV/Paramount did to the complete series, and without resorting to double-sided discs or spindles. The previously released single-season sets each took up the shelf-space equivalent of two standard DVD cases, for a series total of just under 14 inches. This newly released Complete Series measures just 5 inches wide. Thats a pretty dramatic difference, and the packaging is well designed. Forty-four single-sided discs are housed on plastic pages, with no stacking or overlapping, in two large sturdy plastic containers that slide into a substantial cardboard slipcase. All 263 episodes from the series 1993-2004 run are included, along with the same special features from previous releases.

Frasier is rated TV-PG for innuendo and some adult situations, but its largely tame enough for the whole family to watch. Will it work as family viewing? If the kids are in their mid to late teens, yes. Otherwise, young ones won't get the jokes and the plots aren't as dependent on sight gags or occasional slapstick as much as the typical sitcom. And if you don't like the Crane brothers, you won't like this series, because the plots revolve around themwhether its ex-wife problems, unrequited love, or jockeying for snobbish recognition over whos going to be named wine steward. But it remains one of TVs most intelligent and witty comedies.

Language:  a few mild swear words (damn, hell)
Sex:  mostly innuendo, but one show involves Frasier being caught in a prop bed with his ex-wife, a kiddie singer, and when the bed raises to the stage and an audience of small children and their moms Frasier emerges in a diaper and pretends to be a baby, though its clear to adults what was going on
Violence: None
Adult situations:  Social drinking, mostly sexual situations, with everything implied and nothing shown
Takeaways:  Sometimes intellectuals can be too smart for their own good

2937015,2,B000VDDE18,"Just loved the series Frasier and oh so looked forward to getting the complete series to add to my collection...alas, when I got it I was disappointed.  A must for any series is the ability to select a ""Play all"" so all the episodes on a DVD can play without intervention.  No here, you have to select the episode each time. Secondly, and even more important, they are not re-mastered to fit the screen of the viewing TV, and have no option to change that, and the display quality suffered for it.  I have a 55"" LEDTV and the video plays as if it is for an old TV (leaving over 8"" of black space on either side of the displayed show.  This, even though the series was produced during the time of larger TV screen sizes and resolutions.  So I am sad to say that now this complete series will just sit on the shelf never to be watched...I should really just send it back.",1428796800,9,869,4.210843373493976
2937016,5,B000VDDE18,"FRASIER: THE COMPLETE SERIES is a 44-disc box set containing over 250 episodes of the show that originally ran from 1993 to 2004. A spin-off of CHEERS, the show starred Kelsey Grammer as psychiatrist Frasier Crane. The premise was that he left Boston, divorced his wife Lilith, and moved back to Seattle to start fresh. He had a new job, hosting a radio advice program. Niles ( (David Hyde Pierce), Frasiers brother, was a also a psychiatrist, even more neurotic and fussy than Frasier. Their blue-collar dad, Martin (John Mahoney), was a retired cop, who was disabled and came to live with Frasier along with his dog, Eddie, who tended to sit and stare at Frasier. Daphne (Jane Leeves) was the fathers British home-care aide. Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin) was Frasiers producer who screened his radio calls.

As with most series, FRASIER had its highs and low points, but overall it was one of the more consistently entertaining and well-scripted comedies of the 1990s. Among the best shows are:
Room Full of Heroes (Season 9) - Frasier throws a Halloween party in which guests had to come as their idol and stay in character the whole party. Niles comes as Martin; Martin as Joe DiMaggio, Daphne as Elton John, Roz as Wonder Woman, and Frasier as Sigmund Freud.
An Affair to Forget (Season 2) - Niles ex-wife, Maris (never seen on screen) was an ongoing gag on the series. One of Frasiers radio callers suspects her Bavarian husband of cheating on her with his fencing student, and Maris just happens to have a Bavarian fencing instructor. The episode includes a swashbuckling sword duel between Niles and the Bavarian.
Martin Does It His Way (Season 3) - When a distant relative dies, Martin reflects on his lifelong dream of writing songs for Frank Sinatra. With help from Frasier and Niles, Martin begins composing.
Something Borrowed, Something Blue (Season 7) - Niles finally won over Daphne in this one-hour season finale.
Goodnight, Seattle (Season 11) - This is the two-part series finale. Though filled with plenty of gags, this episode has a bittersweet feel and ranks as one of the most satisfying series finales among TV comedies.

This set collects all 11 seasons along with extras previously available on individual season sets. Included are 2 episode commentaries and numerous featurettes that cover many aspects of the series, such as the Niles/Daphne attraction, the dog Eddie, the mystery of unseen Maris, Rozs dating tips, and Frasier Cranes apartment. Also included is a conversation with Art Director Roy Christopher.

The set is packaged with a slipcase in 2 volumes, one devoted to Seasons 1 through 6, the other containing Seasons 7 through 11.",1428710400,2,2664,4.928730512249444

2937020,5,B000VDDE18,"Since there are concerns throughout the Amazon world regarding the country of origin of these television DVD sets, I contacted an Amazon representative via chat.  He checked their internal records and advised me that the country of origin for this set is the USA.

As to the concern about them being in full screen format ... this is a television show so was filmed in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  Turning it into a widescreen format could cause some picture loss and seeing it full screen loses nothing.

The quality of the show speaks for itself.  I hope the quality of the DVDs are equal to the talent of the actors and writers who made Frasier the best of the best in the sitcom world.",1427846400,74,681,4.459677419354839

2937023,4,B000VDDE18,"From the description and in particular the extras, this set appears to be all of the Frasier Season DVDs that were released individually starting a decade or so ago collected into one big box. The fact that all the extras are identical to what is found on Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 11 basically says that if you already own all the DVDs, there is no reason to buy this set.

As a series, Frasier was one of the best sit-coms ever made. While it can be argued that the show peaked in Seasons 2 - 6, the final season offered some great shows, in particular ""The Doctor is Out"" with Patrick Stewart hamming it up brilliantly and the somewhat unfairly maligned first season which also offered some real gems. While it is fair to say that Seasons 8, 9 and 10 slipped somewhat in terms of the writing, all in all you owe it to yourself to have this series if you are a Frasier fan.

The best recommendation for purchasing the ""old fashioned"" DVDs is the price itself as long as it stays around $75. That is a true bargain as it comes out to less than $7 per season. When you consider how much it costs for one season online, that is a real deal assuming you still like having DVDs in your home.

To be fair, I've docked one star from my review not based on the series itself, but simply on the fact that this offering is really nothing new as you could buy all the seasons at once before. All this does it put it in a new box that holds all the DVDs together and adds nothing new which frankly is a shame. If you are are so-so on Frasier, then I would recommend purchasing a few shows online such as ""The Matchmaker"", ""Agents in America, Part III"" or ""The Ski Lodge"". Actually, you could just buy Season 2 which I consider to be the best season of any sit-com ever. However, if you love Frasier and would enjoy showing off this large box in your home, then by all means buy this new package.",1427846400,41,1879,4.185082872928176

2937126,5,B000VDDE18,"For any show to manage eleven seasons is a milestone. For Kelsey Gramer to have come off of the 11 season ""Cheers"" (though hge joined the cast in it's second season, leaving the original; ""Sunday In The Park With Goerge"" to do so, he played rasier Crame for 20 years. But the true stars here are David Angell, Peter casey and David Lee who developed the show while their suiccesful show ""Wings"" was still on the air which they developed while their succesful show ""cheers' was still on the air. Frasier broke the miold and was one of the last of NBC's ""must see TV"" stars. (that ended with Will and Grace"" and NBC has slipped to the bottom since. ""frasier' won Emmhy after Emmy- always beating ""riends"" largely because of the writing and because they aimed at an intelligent audience. We weren;t told that an episode was modeled after eydeau, but they prooved it was just as popyular. The comedy came from the characters, not situations and the cast was just about the best in television.

Grub Street did a great job of bringing in actors for long arcs (Wendie Malick who ended upo marrying Martin) will always be regarded as a lead on Frasier as will Marsha Norman, Feliicity huffman (whose arc and in particular the famous ""pictionary"" sequence is unorgetable.) Jean Smart will always be a regular and Dan Butler has never been in ANYTHING hwere his finger prints weren't left all over it. Every single meber of the cast was fantastic.. Bebe Neuwirth was a mainstay to the show even on those years where she showed up in only one episodee.

The greatest gift is David Hyde Pierce, an acgor of such brilliance that he pulled off a 12 minute scen by himself with no dialouge as he prepared for a Valentine's date that let him face down on Frasierr's birned couch.

We watched Jane Leeves grow up as Daphne grew up and we watched the boisterous Peri Gilpin be permitted to show her sentimental side. The story lines were brilliant and though the last three seasons become a little too much regarding Frasier's search for a life-time companion, they at least justified it with a bit of a break down where Frasier goes of to be by himself and invesitgates his mind where Lilith, Diane Chambers, Nanette Gusman and Mother are there in the room with him playing his subconcious.

the series ends leaving only one loose end- rasiers, but we see him making a bold hgesture and there is hope, which is what Frasier was always about.

Watching Frasier Crame grow from the destroyed mess who swept the bar at Cheers to a comfident man able to sooth and comfort and be very comfortable with who he is was like the best element of this series.

You should be forewarned that the first four season do not contain a ""play all"" option and MANY is the disc I've not boought for this reason. As a result, I often don;t bother with the first three seasons- a pity as the pilot is a work of art.",1394150400,,2877,4.512476007677543

It is well produced throughout, and has lots of laughs, and depth of character.  What the reviewers may have been reacting to is the drift away from radio station based interaction to the personal lives of the ensemble.

2937171,5,B000VDDE18,"I purchased this set back in September, but I thought it only proper to watch a few 'seasons' of it first to give a knowledgeable review. From having read some of the earlier reviews it would seem as though there were some issues with erratic/poor packaging, and the DVD set containing previews.

It would seem that Paramount has changed things since then and I found the packaging to be extremely nice albeit the DVD's do not come in hard cased plastic jewel boxes, but then again, I did not expect them to. It comes in eleven uniform separate boxes(one for each season)with four DVD's to a box. Absolutely NO previews, and a very nice added attraction of having some 'special features' which contains comments by all of the actors, director's, set designer, art director, etc. You can also chose, if you so wish, to turn on the directors comments, but I quickly found that option to become quite irritating. All in all... a must have if you love 'Frasier' as much as I do and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

ADDENDUM:
I finally ran across a disk that had some `previews' on it, but it was quite easy to skip them by simply hitting the `Next Chapter' button on the control, and was certainly no issue whatsoever. Also, by all means keep checking in on the price here as it seems to fluctuate quite drastically up and down! On this date, 11/04/2013, it is selling for $159.96, whereas I only paid $119.98 on 09/09/2013. If you're in no rush then by all means check out the price from week to week and grab it when it, hopefully, goes down again. ;)",1383264000,2,1559,4.5053003533568905

2937174,5,B000VDDE18,"My mother purchased this set for me as a gift and oh, what a wonderful gift it is.  I maintain to this day that 'Frasier' was the funniest show that was ever on TV and it managed to be funny for eleven years.  This set does not disappoint.  Every episode, every memorable scene, every snippet of brilliant dialogue is mine to enjoy whenever I wish.

Admittedly, there are not many extras but as I am someone who never watches the extras anyway (I simply don't care how your film, show, etc. was made) that does not matter to me.  What matters to me is the show itself and seeing as how I am now navigating a TV landscape that has next to nothing to offer me (everything is simply not funny or vulgar and crude) I truly appreciate having DVD sets of my favorite shows to watch when there is nothing of worth being offered to me.

So, I am grateful for this set that I has probably become some of my most watched DVDs.",1381017600,,916,4.2057142857142855

2937186,5,B000VDDE18,I had to give this product the 5 star rating based on the show itself...I can't really rate the quality of the packaging or the disc just yet because I haven't even opened them yet...but when I do I'm sure you will hear from me again rather it be yea or nay,1379980800,,257,3.9615384615384617
2937187,5,B000VDDE18,"The first time Frasier Crane showed up on Cheers (as Diane's new ex-boyfriend no less), I sized him up and figured he would be around for maybe 6 episodes.

After listening to him for a couple of episodes, I actually began to dislike the character immensely and prayed that he would leave.

But he quickly grew on me over the years. I think it was about the time Lilith showed up and the two of them began flirting, in that totally-devoid-of-emotion manner that the pair pulled off so well. Lots of successful shows also spawn great spin-offs, but in all my years I have never seen anything like the perfect storm that created ""Fraiser"".

When I go back now and watch ""Cheers"", it doesn't seem to me to be as funny as it did when I originally watched it on NBC's killer Thursday night line-up. Who doesn't remember that ratings juggernaut? ""The Cosby Show"", ""Family Ties"", ""Cheers"" & ""Night Court"".

""Fraiser"", however, remains one of the outstanding, timeless and classic comedies of all time. How could it go wrong?

1. You have the unbelievably wonderful brother Niles, who is like a mirror image of his brother. Indeed, in the first few episodes, Frasier behaves more like the character we know from Cheers. But Niles wears him down, and soon enough that ""every man"" charisma that Frasier spent years building up on Cheers vanishes entirely. ""Let's try a glass of sherry!"" the two brothers decide one night, and it quickly becomes a tradition. As does filing their nails.

2. Frasier's troubled relationship with his Dad makes the whole show shine that much brighter. Instead of flying in occasionally from Boston to pay lip service to family, Frasier relocates to Seattle and promptly racks up eleven wonderful years of memories with his father and brother.

3. The Niles and Daphne love story is a long simmering, interesting backstory that takes its time playing out, with Maris unexpectedly interfering on a repeated basis even though she NEVER makes an appearance in the series.

4. Roz remains one of my favorite characters to this day... although a bit promiscuous, she is the link to Fraiser's new radio show that keeps him balanced with his home life. Most of the ""troubled people"" who call into the radio show are actually really famous celebrities. Sometimes you can clearly recognize them by their voices, and at other times you need to watch the credits at the end of each episode.

5. Then there are the regulars from ""Cheers"" who show up from time to time.

All in all, this is a comedy unlike any other you will see. It is both a celebration of success in America and a merciless satire of it combined into endless laughs. Whether it be competing for ""Corkmaster"" of their wine club or the complex and utterly disastrous attempt to open a restaurant together, the chaos and laughs that Frasier and Niles bring to our television screen never seem to end. And Frasier's dad surprisingly has even less sympathy for the narcissistic, pompous behavior of his boys. Although he loves them dearly, he never misses an opportunity to point out the complete idiocy of their ""holier than thou"" behavior.

I laughed so hard during some of these episodes that I had tears running down my eyes. Here's hoping you pick up this ""complete series"" package at a deep discount and spend your days laughing just as much.

It really was a wonderful clique of characters and it really doesn't matter when you watch this series.

For people who want television at its best on the shelves of their home collection, this series is a MUST HAVE!",1378512000,,3537,4.741042345276873
2937188,5,B000VDDE18,"Frasier and Niles are fussy and pretentious to the max. The other characters are down to earth and help to keep Frasier and Niles grounded. The humor is first rate especially for the first seven seasons. After that, it remains humorous and at times funny, but seems to be a little contrived. Yet, I would never refuse entry to my living room because this is one of the best ensemble casts in the sitcom world. This is worth every penny of the money and every minute of the time.

There are a couple minutes but there are at least five shows on each Disc and once you watch the commercial on the first disc you don't have others. Love the product. Each show is about 20 minutes because NO COMMERCIALS!  I watch them while I'm doing the elliptical - two shows and a 5 min cool down and I'm done. I get to laugh while exercising!  It's great!

Make the best of it--fix a snack.  I just ordered it.
I read the reviews that state Paramount added 6 to 7 minutes of commericals at the beginning of the first DVD's of each season.
I usually wind up pausing the DVD anyway, to ""do"" something.  So, get your sandwich during the commercials.
Another reviewer is giving updates that the commericals lessen with the later seasons.
1. I REALLY APPRECIATED THOSE REVIEWS--thanks!!
2. I REALLY LOVE FRASIER!! This is the first time I have seen it available ""Complete Series""- can't live without it.
Seriously, I have lost income, and am dropping my TV access.  Have to cut down.
I can get my news on radio and internet.
I can watch Netflix on my internet (but they do drop things--and this is the FULL SERIES OF FRASIER AND AT A DISCOUNT!)
I can watch DVD's on my computer or DVD player on my TV screen.

2937221,1,B000VDDE18,"Like many others, I bought the set when Paramount started using plastic jewel cases in lieu of the original box sets, but before Amazon started posting a notice on the site that current sets were now being sold like this. And like many others, I was disappointed to see this and returned it.

My main disappointment is not with the fact that the box set was not what I was expecting, but that Paramount has confusingly and majorly botched the release and sale of this series' box set. Every successful show that has been released on DVD has always been packaged by the studios in a special, unique box set when sold as a complete series - EXPECT Frasier!? Why? One of the greatest sitcoms in television history, and Paramount thought simply wrapping together the individual season box sets in plastic wrap was the right way to commemorate and sell the complete series. It reeks of laziness and disrespect for the fans, and is a poor reflection of the quality that Frasier was known for. I refused to buy this set for this reason ever since it was released and would have continued to do so if it hadn't been for Amazon's flash major discount sale (but even the major savings couldn't stop me from returning it). I also can't believe the producers of the show could let this happen (that is, if they had any say in this matter).

And then what did Paramount decide to do when they started running out of certain individual box sets for the complete series? Create ugly, cheaper plastic jewel cases instead of keeping the set consistent. Another slap in the face of consumers. This would've been the perfect opportunity to release a unique complete series box set since the demand was obviously there and new packaging had to be produced anyway, but no, they take the cheaper route (but still charge the same price).

I love this show and still enjoyed it even during the final seasons when the writing quality wavered, but I will never but the complete series in its current form. Shame on you Paramount. Shame...on...you.",1354060800,22,2021,4.65546218487395

2937225,5,B000VDDE18,"Nobody thought Kelsey Grammer's role of Frasier Crane would last more than a few episodes on the series, ""Cheers."" Kelsey Grammar is a very talented actor with a Juilliard training and stage presence. He doesn't come across as the sexy leading man but that's okay. Despite his chaotic offscreen life, he breathed Frasier Crane into a likable pompous character that lasted two decades in three different series.

When Cheers ended it's run after 11 seasons, Kelsey Grammer's Frasier Crane divorced Lilith Sternin and moved cross country to Seattle, Washington where he became a radio psychiatrist. Once there, he settled into his new bachelor pad until his retired cop father  Martin Crane (played brilliantly by John Mahoney) and his beloved pet dog, Eddie (played by Moose who should have been included in the credits), have to move in with him in his high-rise apartment with a great city view. You just have to love Eddie, Martin's pet dog and best friend. Eddie loves to stare at Frasier for some strange reason.

We get to meet Frasier's equally brilliant uptight and high society brother, Niles Crane (played brilliantly by David Hyde-Pierce), who is also a psychiatrist and looks down upon Frasier's gig at the radio station. Niles is married to unseen Maris, a high society doyenne of Seattle. Then there is Roz Doyle, Frasier's radio producer. Roz is perfectly played by Peri Gilpin who replaced Lisa Kudrow in the role. Probably a better choice for this character.  Niles can't help but be attracted to his father's physical therapist, Daphne Moon (played by Jane Leeves) despite being married to Maris.

There are other characters in the eleven year series. I'm enjoying watching the episodes on television but I would love to have all of them on DVD. The series was well-written, smart, and didn't dumb itself down at times to appease the audience. The series never had the bathroom humor injected in today's shows. Frasier lasted 11 seasons and it's a great ride for the cast and crew.

Unfortunately on September 11, 2001, series creator and writer, David Angell, and his wife Lynn Angell were returning to Los Angeles, California for the primetime Emmys when they were aboard American Flight 11 that crashed into the first World Trade Center on that day killing them and thousands of others.

2937231,3,B000VDDE18,"I don't need to repeat what countless others have stated regarding the quality of the show, except to say I find it as uproariously funny, sophisticated, and outlandish as anybody else. It's a wonderful series with intelligent writing that, despite its veneer of high culture, has something for just about everybody. That said, I've found in reading other reviews that I am not alone in discovering a number of defects in the packaging and manufacturing of the discs - throughout the entire series - that severely hampers the enjoyment of the show.

I had to send back my first order of this series and demand another due to the extreme number of scuffs and scratches on the discs, making them nearly unplayable. I was told I was accidentally sent a used set and eventually received a replacement set that, to my dismay, also had the occasional scuff or scratch on the discs. But more than that, even the discs that were immaculate had playing errors. Skipping was common place, so much so that I'd estimate a good 50% of the 44 discs this set encompasses had some sort of problem with them, from the occasional and forgivable hiccup in playing to more egregious errors (such as one of the four discs in the final season NOT PLAYING AT ALL).

I don't know if the discs are just made very poorly or if there are a high number of bootlegs floating around and being sold by legitimate dealers, but I was extremely disappointed in the condition of the discs in this series. The packaging is also kind of cheap with shoddy printing quality and exposed areas of glued inserts; on top of that, the mechanism keeping the discs in place is sometime so furiously uncooperative that you feel as if you're going to snap the disc in half before safely finessing it from its cradle. In short, it's a fantastic show but if you're thinking of ordering it, prepare for the possibility of a damaged or defective product.",1330560000,6,1902,4.640949554896142
2937232,5,B000VDDE18,"To be able to watch every episode in order, from the first to the last, has given me greater appreciation for the series as a whole......even the episodes that I may have seen in the past. In fact, having seen episodes in syndication out of order lessened my understanding of some of them. A fact I didn't completely appreciate until making this purchase.

Also, many poster gave poor reviews because they were forced to watch ""previews"" for other TV series DVD sets without the recourse to skip them. Well, I had no problem AT ALL skipping them with the chapter skip/forward button on my Sony DVD player. Either Paramount changed the format to allow the newer DVD's to skip past the previews or those people who are complaining about it need to upgrade their DVD player. Either way, when I pop in a Frasier disc I can go right to the episode list.

I have no regrets with this purchase, and for anyone who has enjoyed Frasier in syndication over the years will enjoy watching all those episodes that you never saw before, and in chronological order to boot.

The price is a little steep, but considering the enormous amount of viewing time required to see each one, it's worth it.......unless you have nothing but time on your hands, it will take the average person a couple of months just to see them all and that's if you are consistent about watching them when you have the chance. Otherwise it will take longer........it's like reading ""War and Peace"".

Well, that is all I have to say......I hope this was helpful for anyone on the fence about making this purchase.....and as the good Dr. Crane would say: ""I wish you good night, and good mental health"".",1330387200,4,1660,4.6169491525423725

Frasier was my husband's favourite funny show, and I swear we have likely seen them all at least 4 or 5 times.......Now I am a widow and have thought for a long time about purchasing the series and finally bit the bullet!  It is such clever, witty, intelligent humour, much along the Noel Coward vein, and you just always get good, happy clean laughs from each programme.
It is s nice set of DVDs and mine are crisp, clean and NO commercials or previews......sooooooooooo nice to view.

I highly recommend before they are no longer available, and they a pretty timeless to watch........Don't get dated really.........that is part of their cleverness......

2937236,5,B000VDDE18,"Just recently, when my husband and I could not find anything to watch on TV, we came across Frasier reruns on The Hallmark Channel.  We began looking forward to watching Frasier at night and all the laughs the shows would bring . . . after a period of time, we were starting to see reruns of the reruns and wanted more episodes to see that maybe we had never seen.  Looking for Christmas presents for my husband, I started my search for the entire Frasier series.  I went to several stores and found some of the episodes but couldn't find the complete series until I searched on Amazon.com.  Good 'ole Amazon.com comes through again and now we are laughing nightly as we enjoy Frasier!",1325203200,2,685,4.5
2937237,3,B000VDDE18,"Frasier is an amazing TV show. The wit, the dry humor, and the wonderful characters made this an DVD set an instant purchase. However my experience with this set has been less then ideal. Here are the pro's and con's that I am sure many of you have seen.

Pro.
---
1. The Box looks really nice and fits well on the shelf.
2. The sound quality is pretty good, and there is also a 'Play All Episodes' feature on some of the DVD's.
3. The majority of the DVDs work and don't skip.

Con.
---

1. There are at least 4 DVDs that don't work or have severe problems. I have tested these DVDs on SEVERAL DVD players and the problem seems to be on the DVD.

2. There is an annoying 5 minute commercial that you have to watch, that you can't skip that paramount has placed at the beginning of any DVD that is played.

3. Many of the DVDs do NOT have any additional features.

I only give this a 3 out of 5 stars because of the bad DVDs. This seems to be a common problem and it is really frustrating to spend so much money on a product that does even WORK!",1324512000,9,1045,4.0
2937238,2,B000VDDE18,"Great series! Good to have the complete package. What I didn't like though is that these were meant for the US market, so I cannot run them on European DVD players with EU region code...
However they do play on my laptop, and then I find it annoying that I do not have the Dutch subtitles. So in summary, I regret having bought this!",1324425600,,333,4.21875

However, I also look at the aesthetics of the actual set -- how will it look on my shelf for display.  Unfortunately, you MAY or MAY NOT get each season in it's manufactured cardboard box.  I'm guessing it depends on whether that particular shipping center has the correct pieces to bundle together.  In my case, I received Seasons 1-7 in the slim, plastic cases....and Seasons 8-11 in their cardboard boxes.  For some people, this won't be a problem.  For me, I was unsatisfied with the purchase.  I have since returned the item.

I had to have the full set.  I purchased the complete series set from Amazon.  Strange that one season is packaged differently than the others, but no big deal.  Out of all 10 seasons I found 3 shows that were bad recordings - one in season 2 and two in season seven.  Since I would have had to return the entire set it made no sence to me to return it for another.  Even with the bad recordings, the purchase was well worth it for me.

2937247,5,B000VDDE18,"I balked at paying so much at one time for a whole comedy series.  I almost never spend this much money at one time on DVDs.  I rec'd the set timely, DIRECTLY from Amazon.  I'm on the 7th Season.  I missed this series when it was on originally, so most of the shows I'm watching, I'm seeing for the first time.  IMO, this is one of the best written, well acted, and funniest sitcoms ever.  Some of the shows remind me of the classic I Love Lucy shows.  I have really enjoyed this set of DVDs and don't regret paying this much.  The two or three beginning seasons are packaged differently, but that doesn't bother me.  Still, I wonder, what with the profit the company is making on these things, why not repackage those to look like the others?  As for the ads at the beginning...these appear in mine beginning after several seasons.  I got my set directly from Amazon, not from another seller.  If some sets don't have those, I suspect it's something the manufacturer started doing later, or did before and stopped.  But for those who say their players won't fast forward past them, maybe your SKIP button will work on them.  I have two DVD players:  a Panasonic and a Sony.  The Panasonic is a nice one, but sort of old. The Sony is both somewhat old and didn't cost that much.  Both of them have ""index"" or ""next section"" or ""skip"" buttons.  Those are like fast forward, except the disk will SKIP to the next section of the disk.  I am able to SKIP past each ad to the next, so I just SKIP, and then SKIP, and then SKIP again.  It's an irritation, but most DVDs have ads at the beginning these days, and the SKIP button works well on them.  The SKIP button works in reverse, as well.  Fast forward usu. doesn't work on ads on DVDs for me.

The video and audio quality are good. But the show wasn't made in HD, I think. I don't know if shows can be remastered to make them HD if they weren't made that way originally. All I know if the audio and video quality seem good to me for a tv show.  I haven't finished all of the seasons yet, but so far, no bubbles or messed up parts on the disks.  If I encounter that, I will update.

UPDATE: I finished all the disks. There were no bubbles or flaws in any of the disks.",1312848000,5,2215,4.201900237529691
2937248,5,B000VDDE18,"I wanted to write a review of the complete series set because I have read a multitude of bad reviews, saying that the commercials were vast and impossible to advance past. Also, I have read that there were problems with the DVDs being read by disc players and season 2 was a pirated copy in a multitude of cases.

  I have played all of the seasons (1-11) and I have seen none of the above problems. I do see that my Seasons 1 and 2 are packaged differently (sturdy plastic cases rather than cardboard), but everything is here, plays perfectly without forced commercials, all of my discs are playing normally and the video is crystal clear and beautifully mastered. None of my discs were copied/pirated and everything is professionally done. I previously owned seasons 1-6 of the original releases, so I do know how seasons 1 and 2 are supposed to look and what the features are. They are all here, just as I remember.

  I have to say that outside of seasons 1 and 2 looking a little different on my shelves, I love this set. I personally feel that many of these complaints are because most of the customers DID NOT purchase directly from Amazon and were the victims of DVD piracy. This is unfortunate and I have nothing but sympathy for these buyers and bought directly from amazon specifically because of their warnings and descriptive posts! Thank you all for your warning and protection.. This is why I love the Amazon Community. We protect each other...

  I am happy with my set and I would very much recommend buying The Frasier Complete Series DIRECTLY from Amazon..

This is how you buy directly form Amazon. Don't just ""Add to Cart"". Follow these steps. Sometimes Amazon will forward your order if they think you can get it faster from an Amazon seller, so don't just add it.. Follow these steps...

1. click on ""new"" link. (just below the list price. The link should say something like 24 new, and will be to the left of the used link)
2. Choose ""Amazon"" as your seller, from the list of sellers.

That's it!

If you liked the Fraser series when it was on Prime Time television, you'll have fun seeing it all again  at your leisure, without commercial content, and on your own big-screen TV.
The writers were at top form during the first few seasons with some side-splitting, slapstick comedy.
Fraser, Nihles, Daphne, Roz, Martin, and of course Eddie (the pooch), Bulldog (the sportscaster), and Gil (the food critic), all are a joy to see and laugh at. It's fun to guess the Celebrity callers to the Dr. Fraser Crane Show and watch the hilarious hijinks of other special guests. The connection to ""Cheers"" is cleverly done but not overdone.

2937266,5,B000VDDE18,"In my (not so humble) opinion, this is the best sitcom that was ever on television. I have other favorites, of course, but every time I watch this series, I am reminded of how truly outstanding it is. (Sidenote: I did not like the ""Cheers"" TV show at all, but I absolutely adore ""Frasier."")

The casting was spot on, and all the main characters--who are all played by simply brilliant actors--stayed for the full eleven years. They even added new characters (including children) efficiently and seamlessly without giving us the ""Scrappy Doo"" effect and brought in character appearances from ""Cheers"" that worked well. Unlike other shows that went on for a long time, their content never got stale, and I never said to myself, ""They should have ended this show years ago."" (Plus, the writers were pretty consistent in their facts, although I have noticed some inconsistencies because I have no life and have watched the series dozens of times.)

The writing is beyond brilliant, the characters grow and mature naturally and meaningfully. The budding romance between Niles and Daphne is done so very well, I just adore the tension and when they finally get together! The ending is really nice and hopeful, even if it doesn't give full closure to the series. It's one of the only shows that has made me laugh out loud in my living room because the combination of the actors' comedic timing and the script is so spot on.

This show has such quality that it endears itself to me even more because I really feel like it was a true labor of love for everyone who played a part in making it what it is.

2937274,5,B000VDDE18,"8/9/2010 - I honestly don't see how anyone can possibly complain about this set! Then again, I purchased the set *directly* from Amazon and received it in *precisely* the packaging that has been portrayed here in its online listing (one package/box per season).

Audio quality is excellent. Video quality is also excellent, especially considering that the oldest episodes were (apparently) not digitally enhanced - as far as I can tell, NONE of the episodes were but the transfers were excellent nonetheless. All 40+ discs play perfectly well. Many of the added special features are quite good. And although Paramount's ""coming attractions,"" starting with the Season Four set, play before the episodes do they CAN be skipped by pressing your remote's Chapter Skip Forward button.

Although $200+ is certainly a bit steep for a tv series, considering the total number of discs & episodes along with the generally high quality of the transfers, I'd say the set is a MUST BUY for any Frasier fan. If you enjoy Frasier, just buy the set - you'll not regret it!

8/24/2010 - HAD to offer this ""update."" I'd forgotten exactly HOW good this series was. I've got quite the collection of sitcom sets (including Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Ramond, among others) but this one is the TOPS hands-down. It's so good that once you start watching the first episode on a disc you're immediately inclined to watch the rest of them - kind of like reading a book that's so good you just can't put it down until you're either too tired or you know the AM alarm's about to ring... consequently I 'm already through Season Six. Sure the other shows are all top-notch, but this one has the depth, intelligence, heart AND soul that the others seem to come up a bit short on. The stars' superb comical acting skills are all pretty much consistently demonstrated throughout. The ""guest callers"" that are in most all of the episodes and even many of the guest stars collectively constitute a marvelous collage of memorable personalities of the stage, screen and television from decades past (and present). And the incredible Shakespearean and slapstick comedy elements here and there elevate it all to sheer genius. It's no wonder that the show lasted 11 seasons.

2937282,5,B000VDDE18,"If you put a gun to my head, I might have to choose FRASIER over SEINFELD. It would be close though. The big difference between the two is that I actually like Frasier and Niles Crane and wish I knew them as friends.  I really don't want to be friends with the characters on Seinfeld although I find them hilarious.  The genius of FRASIER is the premise of two brothers who are both outstanding psychiatrists in Seattle who have a terrible time with their personal lives.  Neither of them has an easy time with their Dad, a retired, disabled police officer, who now lives with Frasier.  Neither has had good luck with women and that continues for most of the show.  Frasier has been married twice and Niles has an impossible wife at the start of the show and is single not too far into the series.  However, here is the key.  These two really want to be find the love of their lives.  However, they are both so neurotic, so fussy, so bent on disaster, that it is like aiming to pluck a blue moon out of the sky.  Both of them were the kids who never got picked for sports, were bullied in school, wanted but never got the prom queen and so forth and so on.  They are both so fussy about everything that some people assume they are gay instead of straight as they obsess over interior decor, wine, food, designer clothing, opera, and theater.  They are both musical with Frasier singing at every chance (he is better at it in real life than in the show) and Niles playing the piano.  When asked to name their favorite American tv show in the UK, FRASIER took top spot.  This was not faint praise as the UK has excellent tv shows.  Frasier Crane was also a character on CHEERS so I mistakenly started watching CHEERS so I could experience more of Frasier.  This was a mistake because Frasier became a much better character on his own series.  The pairing of Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) with David Hyde-Pierce (Niles) has got to be one of the greatest comedic pairings of all time.  I can't go for long without watching it again.  You can't go wrong here.

2937283,4,B000VDDE18,"We love Frasier!  This show is hilariously funny, mostly fast-moving and so true-to-life.  Never saw many episodes when it first aired, but find it's MUCH better to watch the episodes in order, now that we have the DVD set.  We were hoping the price would go lower; got it for $149 recently.  We don't like the way season two is packaged, it is packaged very differently (cheaper).  Some of the second season discs were dislodged during shipping, as the case doesn't seem to hold them securely.  Overall, we are glad we ordered Frasier, as we all need a little more humor in our lives!  UPDATE:  We're a few seasons in and have discovered one VERY ANNOYING THING about this set.  There are an excessively COPIOUS AMOUNT of other series previews that you must wait for at the start of each disc.  It started with a few and now is up to over 6 minutes worth and growing with each season.  You can not fast forward or skip them and must wait for them each time you turn on the DVD player.  So, every time we want to watch an episode, we must start the DVD player at least 6 minutes before we plan on watching.  This is becoming EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING!!!  We still love Frasier, but would hope this is removed with a new series set.  We would never buy any of those previewed series, as we don't like being forced to watch them on a DVD we paid for and by now, we are thoroughly sick of those previewed series.  Hope this helps!  UPDATE:  After several seasons of watching annoying previews, they seem to be lessening with the later seasons and mostly are confined to the first disc of each season.  Will update further, if needed.",1248220800,140,1626,4.4324324324324325
2937284,5,B000VDDE18,"Generally, I find dry humor very funny. But over-the-top, and slap-stick humor can make me laugh just as much. Sometimes, I won't even get a joke, or think it's very funny, and the audience will laugh.

""Frasier"" has plenty of dry humor, and I laugh probably every time I watch an episode.",1247529600,,289,4.5576923076923075
2937285,5,B000VDDE18,"By far some of the best comedic writing ever on televison, I was happy to find the entire series offered at a reasonable price for Father's Day.  We are taking it to the beach to have a Frasier Marathon.  The transaction through a third party was easy and fast.

2937286,5,B000VDDE18,"I love Frasier, but who can afford it?  I had all 11 seasons in my cart at $15.99, but took some time to think it over.  When I came back online, they had all gone up where it was almost $50.00 more.  PLEASE put this back on sale!!  I need it bad!!!",1245974400,3,249,3.730769230769231

All the dvds was there just in the wrong box. But all and all it was good. Just like the TV show no added features. But I like Frasier.",1243296000,4,305,3.707692307692308
2937288,5,B000VDDE18,"Without doubt one of the greatest televison programs ever produced. Every element of this series reflects a genuine desire to entertain.  The creators, writers, producers, actors and entire crew combine to provide a clever and sophisticated yet warm and quirkily inviting environ. One which captures and quizzes the viewers mentality and sentimentality.  From the oft eerily similar traits of Frasier and Niles, to the harsh and blatant differences between them and their father, the lovable needling and wordplay generates delightfully amusing dialogue.  The forbidden, yet unstoppable love of Niles for Daphne injects an underlying tone of hope and desire that renders even the hardest of hearts weak and susceptible to emotional attachment.  The prim and proper Frasier is frequently befuddled by the brash and brazen Roz Doyle, whose sex-capades provide ample fodder for all to dispense. This series defines television entertainment at it's best.",1240790400,,950,5.576388888888889

2937290,5,B000VDDE18,"The is my favorite comedy show. It was well written, well cast, and had excellent storylines, some that lasted throughout several seasons or the entire show. The jokes were more witty, and intelligent and I appreciated that with all the dumb humor on TV. This show is good from season one on, and has good episodes all the way through season 11. IMO it's the best comedy sitcom ever made.
This set is just the 11 individual seasons, and very few extras. However if you are a fan of the show, it's definitely worth getting.",1232150400,4,522,4.505263157894737

If your a fan of Cheers or just a fan of very intelligent comedy Fraizer is just that. If your looking for a television show that is witty and charming look no futher than any of the 11 great seasons of this emmy award winning show that lets us think, feel and laugh with the Crane family.",1231459200,,397,4.1688311688311686
2937292,5,B000VDDE18,"Wow. Just finished this series from start to finish, in about 2 and a half weeks straight.

I watched this pretty religiously for the first three seasons and then lost interest as I left high school. I was a little too young to appreciate all of the play on words and innuendos that each episode contains.

Now, I'm a huge Simpsons and Seinfeld fan and I thought, oh yeah Frasier was ok, a good show, but I had never given it the full treatment. A friend of mine mentioned it to me awhile back and it got me thinking. I never really looked into this series on dvd at all.

Snagged this set for $125 online (for a legit set yes, after getting scammed for the fake set with the wrong dog on the cover, eventually got a refund, but I digress....)

On to the review....The first two seasons are really great from top to bottom. The rest of the seasons are great too, but the show had to grow. The emotional moments are really something. This series, although a comedy, has a lot of heart. You love the characters and root for them to find their place in life.

If you love Seinfeld and Cheers this is probably a no brainer. If you saw a few episodes I heartily recommend a thorough a complete series exploration from start to finish.

The dvds themselves could have better picture, but it's not like you're expecting a total remaster and if you consider that you can find this set for under $11 a season (each one being 4 discs), it's a bargain to say the least.

Really great series, can't say enough. Keep looking up prices. Best I've seen so far is $125 for this whole set, all 44 dvds.",1229990400,3,1585,4.298657718120805
2937293,1,B000VDDE18,"It appears that the set is complete, except that SEASON 2 has a substituted volume that may or may not be a ""sham.""  The set has seasons 1 through 11, as promised, but SEASON 2 has NO BOX and is what appears to be an ""amateur"" duplicate! IN NO WAY DOES IT MATCH THE SET AS AN ORIGINAL. THIS IS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING and I AM SURPRISED SINCE THIS WAS ONE OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE SETS OFFERED AND WAS OFFERED BY AMAZON.COM!!!",1228435200,101,420,4.185185185185185
2937294,2,B000VDDE18,"I've always loved Frasier and the whole cast.  Unfortunately, Paramount has seen it fit to add up to seven minutes of commercials at the beginning of the discs, not editable and without the recourse of being bypassed.  If I wanted to watch that c... I would do that in the reruns. Shame on Paramount!",1223337600,154,300,4.537037037037037
2937295,5,B000VDDE18,"The series was more than I expected.  Each season was in its own boxed set and individually packaged.  Every DVD was in perfect condition and a pleasure to watch.  In Frasier's words, ""Bravo"".",1222560000,5,192,4.757575757575758
2937296,5,B000VDDE18,"The entire series are a delight to watch - Even though I now own the series on DVD, I can't help but wait to watch the next one - regardless if I need to sleep or work, :D. The boxes the DVDs have arrived in is exactly what I wanted, in a booklike format. The set matches well with my books on the shelf.

I like how the show doesn't insult my intellect and focuses on the very real breaking issues that affects life, meanwhile using absurd and subtle humor to illustrate the  variety of solutions to the issues.",1221523200,,512,4.161616161616162

2937302,5,B000VDDE18,"The likes of ""Frasier"" may never again be seen on t.v. I grew up watching the series, and even then I loved it. As I re-watch the episodes, I realized just how much went over my head, so it must have been pretty darn good to impress me as a child.

""Frasier"" is the standard by which I judge all sitcoms, and maybe one or two have ever lived up to its standard. The scripting was simply perfect. It had elements that could and did appeal to a vast and diverse audience. Not only was the script amazing, the acting was equally astounding. Every character had a very unique persona and they delivered their performances with amazing skill without sounding contrived, which is something so many shows are guilty of. The dialogue was sarcastic, witty and downright funny. And for as long as the show ran, it's amazing that it stayed as fresh as it did. Yes it did start to lose some of its sparkle after the umpteen season, but it was still better than any sitcom out there. Nothing was over-looked in crafting the show, and it really paid off. It doesn't matter how many times I watch the same episode, I still laugh almost as hard as I did the first time I watched it. That is a rare find in American t.v. Even ""Eddie"", ""Martin's"" second half, was an amazing actor. The trainers that worked with Moose and Enzo clearly knew what they were doing, because he was one of the funniest characters in the whole show.

It's difficult to really describe ""Frasier"" and really do it justice. It definitely has to go down in the top 5 sitcoms of all time. If you haven't experienced ""Frasier"", you really are missing out on one of the best sitcoms in history.",1208995200,7,1646,4.411184210526316
