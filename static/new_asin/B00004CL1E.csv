7919899,4,B00004CL1E,"At first glance of the standard cover of ""Magic Crystal"", you'd think it's a vehicle for martial arts duo Richard Norton and Cynthia Rothrock. Not so, however: Norton and Rothrock have strong supporting roles, but the real star of the movie is Andy Lau, former king of the Hong Kong pop scene. Additionally, you'd assume by the generic artwork that it's just a plain old Hong Kong police thriller, but this too is not as it seems...at least not entirely, since a third of the way through, the film suddenly switches gears by going off on an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T/dp/B000A2IPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.</a>-inspired fantasy kick and, later, blatantly rips off ""Indiana Jones"". It's a movie that's impossible to judge before watching it, but through the efforts of the performers, it's worth the risk.

The story: after a trip to Greece to find his long-lost friend ends in an excursion with the KGB and Hong Kong Interpol, Andy (Lau,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infernal-Affairs/dp/B00005JN7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infernal Affairs</a>) returns home with his nephew and comic relief brother-in-law (director Jing Wong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-the-Red-Dragon/dp/B00005UM21/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of the Red Dragon</a>) with the former in possession of a magical talking stone sought by the evil KGB thug Karov (Norton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/078062260X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Nice Guy</a>). Assisted by a valiant Interpol agent (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>), they must fend off their attackers while uncovering the mysteries of the stone.

The kung fu cast also includes Fat Chung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spooky-Encounters/dp/B0007IO6Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spooky Encounters</a>) as a dialogue-free henchman and Wan-Si Wong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-the-Liquid-Sword/dp/B00009IAXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of the Liquid Sword</a>) as Jing Wong's wife, who is easily overlooked at first but turns into a real kung fu mama when she grabs a sword and takes on a whole slew of would-be assassins. She's part of what makes the weirder aspects of the film easier to digest, for regardless what questionable shenanigans the characters get into, the universally cool fight choreography balances it out and ought to be considered a highlight in the careers of everybody involved. Despite looking a lot like Yuen Biao, Andy Lau isn't a real martial artist and Cynthia Rothrock was still fresh into her film career, but they both provide stellar offerings alongside a powerful-looking Richard Norton, who was really starting to come into his niche as Hong Kong's number one Caucasian villain at this time. Siu Chung Mok (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-China-Part-2/dp/B00005AWRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in China Part 2</a>) rounds off the bunch as Cynthia's unnamed partner, and together they put to celluloid a decidedly fine physical offering featuring the usual flips and kicks but also some unique counter/grappling exchanges, sweet weapon-handling, and a couple of amazing stunts. It's beyond me why this one never made it into the HK Film Awards.

Ah, but then there's the overall weirdness of the film, which I can't decide if it strengthens the movie's character or simply makes it goofy without good reason. It's not just the usual Hong Kong nonsense of throwing around obscure humor or the fact that Lau's and Rothrock's characters just happen to carry around spears and rappelling ropes as part of their everyday gear, but some downright strange stuff that never would've passed producers in mainstream Hollywood. The whole plot section dealing with the talking stone (which befriends child actor Bin-Bin Siu, procures him ice cream, and punishes a peeping tom by putting his feet where his hands should be) feels really shoved in: these scenes almost feel like they're from a different movie, existing on an alternate plain of seriousness where most of the actors only reluctantly venture. The final scenes are ripped straight from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark/dp/B0014Z4OMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>&nbsp;but nowadays the plot twist feels more akin to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-of-the-Crystal-Skull/dp/B001DTPZNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>. If that's not enough, you get such gem lines as Karov describing his method of torture as ""worse than having AIDS"" and random nuttiness like Jing Wong's character taking a dump in a bidet.

In the end, I'm just glad that the movie is comprehensive enough to follow and easier to laugh at than most low-budget Hong Kong fare. Jing Wong is typically regarded to as the kung fu industry's schlockmaster, but sure enough, he made this one good enough for keeps. It's only a shame that you have to really hunt for a DVD copy...",1278547200,,5486,6.62586926286509
