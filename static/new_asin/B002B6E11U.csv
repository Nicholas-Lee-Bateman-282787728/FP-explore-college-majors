The transformation that the actor makes between his two personalities is over-the-top both ways, which can be pretty funny!  This is a silly film.  It is also a love story.  The offbeat (but at times stereo-types characters) are entertaining.  If you're in the right frame of mind to be entertained by the goofy adventures of the main character as he tries to figure out how to swing between the world of ultra-sweet folk music & head banging death metal, you'll enjoy this film.",1311638400,,595,4.5233644859813085
3892926,5,B002B6E11U,"I've never written a review of anything before, but really felt I had to do what I could to help this movie out - because it's F#@Kn' Awesome!  Toshio Lee and crew couldn't have done better IMO and I've now seen this flick five times (and there are very few pics for which I can make that claim).  Yes, there are some differences between the original manga and anime (including some toning down of the raunchiness), but I don't think you could have translated either of those bit for bit into a live feature and come out with anything special - it would of satisfied only a few die-hard fans. Instead, the live action movie has its own amazing merits and is all the better for them. Go To and GO SEE DMC!!!!",1290816000,,707,4.30827067669173
3892927,5,B002B6E11U,"I wanted to check this movie out after learning that Kenichi Matsuyama was in it. I loved him in the Death Note movies and wanted to see if he was as great in other roles. My boyfriend had seen the anime version of it and was interested in seeing if they kept it similar. During the first viewing, we were both laughing so hard we couldn't stop! We have since bought a copy and watched it quite a few times. I put this on if I just want to laugh. My boyfriend says there are a lot of differences between the anime and this one but he ejoyed both in their own right. If you are looking for something to just laugh at and enjoy the Japanese comedic absurdity, you will love this!",1289260800,3,677,4.097744360902255
3892928,5,B002B6E11U,"this movie is hilarious. it also allows the main actor, kenichi matsuyama, to show off his acting talent as he juggles his two roles between that of a geek and the head of a heavy metal band.",1287705600,5,191,4.1891891891891895
3892929,2,B002B6E11U,"The anime version of the wildly popular manga ""Detroit Metal City"" was the most hilarious thing I've seen in years. An absolute masterwork of black absurdist humor and commentary on the modern music scene that went out of it's way to mock and offend everything and everyone is came across. But how does such a thing translate to a live-action feature film? Not terribly well, I'm afraid. Pity. This could have been something really special, but amateurish direction and a chronically unlikeable cast just smashed this to bits. Most of the offensive jokes are replaced with unfunny gags (""bloomers""?), the music somehow just doesn't sound as good in spite of the fact that many of the same songs are used, and worst of all director Toshio Lee actually attempted to turn the story into a drama around the middle. Does anybody out there want to see a man in full face-painted black metal garb crying in the rain? Didn't think so.

 The sad thing is, this should have and could have worked. But right off the bat we are introduced to a sniveling Soichi Negishi so cartoonishly effeminate and whiny that he makes the animated version seem like a total stud.  Of course, the wannabe pop musician's alter-ego Johannes Krauser II  fronts the infamous death metal band Detroit Metal City and honestly, the actor (Kenichi Matsuyama) does a pretty good job at that, assuming it's his voice that was used. The other members of his band include a bassist who is so obnoxious I was glad he was barely in the movie and a drummer who only says one word over and over. Apparently that is an inside joke of some sort. I do wish that such jokes wouldn't encompass an entire character; the idea of making film is to entertain the audience, not just yourself. DMC's foul-mouthed manager is a ridiculous caricature as well, but the running joke of her putting her cigarettes out in inappropriate places was pretty amusing. Negichi's ladylove is a generic cutout of a clueless innocent Japanese schoolgirl. Boooorrriiiing. The ridiculously uninspired zany performances are possibly the worst thing about this movie.

More time should have been spent on the feuds between DMC and the rival musicans from various genres, which was a particularly enjoyable portion of the original story . All of the challengers are introduced and clumsily done away with in two scenes total. I'm going to have to assume that the freestyle MC battle utilized a lot of Japanese wordplay that didn't translate well because it didn't make a lick of sense to me.  The punk rock scene was pretty awesome, but again the director didn't seem to know what to do to highlight the humor of Krauser accidentally hanging himself by his neck in front of the anti-male girl punk band. The scene clumsily cuts itself short just as an opportunity to squeeze out some laughs comes up. It just seems like the whole team that put this film together just had no interest in or understanding of what made the source material so great to begin with. They simply slapped together a film roughly summing up the plot, added some hyper-cheesy drama to the script and rolled tape.

Now, this adaptation isn't all bad, even considering all my bellyaching. I've read some glowing reviews so this isn't going down in history as the worst movie in history of rock or anything.  In fact, some of the liberties that were taken with the story add significant depth to the superficial (but HILARIOUS) depravity of the source material. The motto ""no music - no dream"" is repeated often as Negichi learns about the people close to him who have been inspired even by his failure as a pop singer. His corny music may be looked down on by everybody else, but if the people he cares about most are inspired by it, is that not reason enough to continue doing what he loves and being proud of it regardless of the opinions of strangers?  And Negichi realizing that his motto applies even to the nihilistic music he makes in DMC was a very nice touch. A great many people are moved by terrible bubblegum pop music, but that by no means diminishes the passion of heavy metal music and it's fans. I can personally attest to the spectacularly positive affect that ""evil"" music has had on my life and has on many others. While some dream of the perfect girl and sunshine and unrealistic naive ideals, others find power and passion in screaming their anger at the dark side of life in a catharsis of brutal noise and exaggerated aggression.  None of this was in the anime and I found it a very smart addition to what is otherwise a very stupid movie.  The highlight of DMC's career is a knock-down drag-out battle with American metal legend Jack Il Dark. While this may not be the best rock showdown in cinema history (Tenacious D take home that prize) it is pretty damn entertaining. Try not to snort when the Metal Buffalo makes his appearance. Oh, and have I mentioned that Jack is played by a certain rock superstar whose band inspired the title of the film/band?  Hells yeah, The Demon himself kicks this film into high gear and performs a delicate tune named ""[...] Palace"". Awesome.  Considering Gene Simmons is one of the greatest performers in music history, I'd say Lee dropped the ball again by not blowing me out of my seat with the showdown, but it still turned out mighty entertaining with a lot of bombast.  My favorite part was Jack cutting his fingers on his guitar strings trying to outrock Krauser's nonstop screams of a certain 4-letter expletive. Unfortunately, the momentum was lost with one of the stupidest parting shots in the history of cinema. This whole movie suffers from the fact that it just wasn't very well thought-out.

To go to DMC or not to go to DMC: that is the question. Personally, I'm telling to you watch the anime instead. It's one of my favorite comedy series of all time. If you loved the anime you probably thought the same thing I did when considering seeing this movie: ""If Krauser doesn't rape Tokyo Tower, I'm not interested"". He doesn't rape Tokyo Tower. Or anything else. But he does say ""rape"" 10 times in one second. At least that's what the fans say he does when he mumbles gibberish really fast. Well if you're a DMC maniac, you're going to see this anyway and I won't stop you, but don't expect anything as great as ""This is Spinal Tap"" or even ""Pick of Destiny"". After the brilliance of the anime, that kind of wonderful is exactly what I was expecting.  But this one was average at best as far as comedy goes and never really clicked with me.  Oh, and folks: planned American remake on the way. Be very afraid.

2 1/2 stars, rounded down for turning black comedy into a harmless farce.",1280793600,7,6652,4.646808510638298
3892930,5,B002B6E11U,"I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud this hard at an anime.  ""Detroit Metal City"" started as a manga and having sold 2 million copies has moved on to the realms of animation and live-action feature film.  The anime is similar in tone to the hysterical American heavy metal animated satire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metalocalypse/dp/B000P2A6CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metalocalypse</a>&nbsp;and might be even crazier, if a lot less gory.  Some day I'm going to count up the number of times words like ""rape"", ""murder"", ""c#nt"", and ""hell"" are used in this 12 episode-series.  Each episode is between 10 and 15 minutes in length and packs in a ton of madcap antics, sexual perversion, heavy music, and vile language.  So what's not to like?

Soichi Negishi is a sweet boy from the country who loves schmaltzy pop songs and dreams of writing commercial jingles and becoming a fashionable artist.  But his secret alter-ego is Johannes Krauser II, demonic frontman of the black metal band Detroit Metal City, renowned for their uncontrollable evil.  While wearing the paint and armor, he molests and abuses a masochistic little old man known as The Pig of Capitolism onstage and specializes in all things rape being it humping inanimate objects or using the word 10 times in a single second in the song ""Rape that B!+ch"".  More on that later.  While Negishi just wants to bring light and happiness to the world, the insane President of Death Records always bullies him into making DMC's antics increasingly bizarre.  This is a woman who verbally measures everything she likes in her life by how wet her crotch gets.  Even to me, this is gross.  The drummer is a man of few words, but instructing a young girl on how he wants her to eat a sausage and uttering the instant classic phrase ""I want to eat curry......in Hell""  when asked what he wants to do make him a great side-character.  Rounding out the cast are DMC's surprisingly well-adjusted bassist, Negishi's girlfriend (who hates DMC more then anything), competing musicians, and of course, DMC's hilariously dedicated fans. Count me among them. I love this show.

Each episode in the DMC saga seems to end up with something completely insane happening that builds the band's legend up.  The situations that arise never cease to entertain.  Negishi may hate everything his music and image as Krauser stands for, but he often loses control of himself when stressed and becomes the demonic lord of death metal even when he's not onstage which is to say that his girl doesn't much appreciate being called a ""b!+ch pig"" and spat on.  And when he goes home to his family to find his little brother wrecking his parent's lives using his music as inspiration, he's forced to don his costume even in his personal life to try and put an evil spin on doing farm chores.  And that's before the rival bands get on the scene.  DMC has to face off first with an anti-male girl punk group who rewrite one of their songs as ""Dumba$z Motherf#@king Cherryboys"".  How to battle the raw energy of punk?  Well, let's just say that after being beaten up by the crowd, Negishi looks a lot like Sid Vicious and rocks a mean loogie as Krauser (which will later be a talent used to ruin a feature film).  And when a local MC who happens to be a childhood friend of Negishi's challenges Krauser to a freestyle battle fun will ensue. And also rape.  But what happens when Jack III Dark, the Emperor of black metal, comes to Japan promising to crush the upstarts who aspire to his throne?  It involves cobra drums, a buffalo, some shiitake mushrooms, a battle to see who can shout ""f#@k"" the most times in a row without stopping, and a guitar said to be made entirely of coagulated blood.  And maybe rape.  Good times.

The visual style of the series is pretty typical, but the picture changes size and shape often -probably to mimic the manga source material- which may annoy a few viewers.  But ""Detroit Metal City"" is a seriously demented gutbuster of an anime that is must-buy material for heavy metal fans or anybody who enjoys ""Metalocalypse"" or black humor.  I'll leave you with a top-5 list of things Krauser ""rapes"" over the course of the series.
5) policewoman
4) his dead parents (in a song at least)
3) turntables
2) a tambourine
1) Tokyo tower

8360793,5,B002B6E11U,"I've seen this film a few times, and it always tickles me!  I saw the price drop on Amazon so I snagged it for a song.

Basically this is a film based on a manga series.  The manga series is MUCH more offensive and shocking than the film, so if you've read the manga, expect this to be a bit more tame.

The story follows a young Japanese musician who gets conned into joining a heavy metal band called DMC.  He really just wants to sing old Enka and pop songs, but can't really seem to quit DMC out of fear of his she-devil manager.  He falls in love with a very wholesome girl who really loves his acoustic and sappy pop songs, but hates DMC.  Oh, and since he's in total costume and makeup, nobody knows he's the real lead singer of DMC: Sir Krauser II.

As a viewer you really can't take things too seriously in this film.  At times DMC sings about 'raping all the women' or 'don't have parents because I murdered them' and so on.  But when you see that the band members are really just singing these songs because it's expected of a hard core metal band, it makes it less shocking.  Still, the super fans do comment on things such as Krauser holding the fastest rape record of 11 rapes in under a minute.  Again.  Just really offensive yet somehow humorous.  Especially since Krauser walks by (not in makeup) when this happens and the fans shove him out of the way calling him a sissy.

It's not for everyone.  But if you can get past a bit of the explicit and often offensive humor, then you can enjoy the movie.  I do love when 'Krauser' scares his little brother into being a good son - 'you have to mow the lawn to practice for cutting the heads off fools' or 'learn to love and care for the animals so that you can be the master of beasts'.  Funny stuff.

I've watched it with at least 10 other friends at various times, and not one person has hated the film or been so offended that they couldn't watch it.",1374969600,,1917,4.2027397260273975
