4216101,2,B003X82D06,"The story of a stalker who made people's lives miserable by bothering them & their children and invading their privacy constantly.
Interesting, but even more so - Sad. Not much fun to watch.",1342828800,6,190,4.787878787878788
4216102,4,B003X82D06,"There is plenty to see in this documentary that makes it fascinating from beginning to end.  Even if you don't recognize the people in the film, I think the stars are respectfully represented in an intriguing way.  It that makes you want to know who they are.  The film emotionally transports you into a world of glamour with complete safety.  As some other reviewers commented it is a springboard into researching some of the names featured, either in books, movies or other media.  Thoughtful, educational and inspiring film.  I hope the girl in the gallery at the end of the movie had the opportunity to watch it later...",1342569600,2,624,4.731481481481482
4216103,5,B003X82D06,"Objective, informed look at the paparrazi and their strange relationship with celebrities. Rmon Galella is one of the most controversial of paparrazi and one of the oldest. (Most paps are in their 20s, Galella is way beyond that) The DVD is fascinating and Galella is both fascinating and repelling at the same time. And, he has been a pioneer in the paparrazi art. Love him or hate him, he's a major player in the NY celeb photography scene. Be warned, this video is really absorbing, so don't start it if you have other stuff you have to do, because it won't get done.",1320451200,6,570,4.543689320388349
4216104,5,B003X82D06,"A really well done profile of an interesting, surprisingly very down to earth guy (Ron Galella), his times and the celebrities who inhabited his world.",1296259200,3,151,5.08
4216105,5,B003X82D06,"While we all enjoy bad mouthing paparazzi...we do have voyeuristic inclinations to see the results of their work.

Some of the more interesting candid photos are taken by people like Ron Galella.

This film gives a glimpse into the life and motivation and methods of Ron Galella, one of the most successful paparazzi.

Nowadays we can be instant paparazzi with our camera phones...if we're at the right place at the right time.
But very few have the motivation or capability or are deliberately methodic enough to make this a  career.

This guy, Ron Galella has such an extensive archive of pictures that when the media or PR agents want some images to include with the ""life story"" of someone famous...he's probably got them.",1296259200,10,726,4.869918699186992
4216106,4,B003X82D06,"Before celebrity news became available 24 hours a day and before taking a picture required no more effort than reaching for your cellular phone, Ron Galella made an art of creating the former via the latter.  Director Leon Gast's documentary SMASH HIS CAMERA tells his story.  Shooting three million-plus photos of well-known people over more than three decades, Galella shows us his warehouse of work, requiring a staff of archivists to manage it.  SMASH HIS CAMERA's dizzying montages of familiar faces he preserved on film leave you star struck.  Marlon Brando leaves Ron Galella with a broken jaw, and the film delves into how much right one has to follow a well-known person down the street to take his or her picture.  Ron Galella, we hear, is ""the price tag of the First Amendment.""

One reason the famous people Ron Galella photographs fascinate us has to be that they fascinate him.  SMASH HIS CAMERA tells of the time he camps out overnight in a warehouse that affords him a bird's eye view of the yacht owned by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.  Those and Galella's many other candid pictures convey the excitement the man must feel as he presses the shutter.

The countless publications and television reports & web sites covering public figures have made celebrities so accessible, they now seem disposable.  Is any as hard to reach today as Ron Galella's favorite subject, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, once was?  It seems impossible for an individual even as mysterious as Jackie O. was to remain out of the limelight, as nearly everyone who recognizes you in public is able to take a photo or video with a cell phone and place it on the Internet.  Were she still with us, Mrs. Onassis would no longer have to wonder if Ron Galella is about to jump from behind a parked car, as most people she passes on the New York City streets could just reach for their cell phone cameras to take her picture.

SMASH HIS CAMERA takes its title from the order Mrs. Onassis once gave bodyguards when she tired of Ron Galella taking her picture.  Frankly, Galella may as well smash it himself.  These days anyone can be a photographer - using a phone that fits in one's pocket, no less.  And with the glut of celebrity information at our fingertips, how much does anyone even want to see the pictures?

4216107,3,B003X82D06,It is o.k. to take pictures of people when they want them taken but he tortured Jackie all the time. I enjoyed all the other celebrities and their smiles.  Stay away from their children.,1363564800,,186,4.470588235294118
4216108,4,B003X82D06,"Very entertaining with all the pictures of a time gone bye. Enjoyed seeing the other side of paparazzi and learning or being reminded of the life of Ron, the photographer.",1363219200,,171,4.733333333333333
4216109,4,B003X82D06,"I love photography which is why I chose to watch this doc in the first place. Secondly, I have always been interested in the paparazzi phenom. I would rate this as 5 star except for the fact that these photogs aren't really talented at all- just lucky and ruthless. I don't agree with the way they endlessly harass celebs and their families BUT do think its expected when you reach a certain level of fame. To sum it up, the film did keep my interest for the duration and I would recommend it. Hope this helps!",1362441600,,510,4.322916666666667
4216110,1,B003X82D06,did not like it.  i  wanted to see more about jackie and  not about photographer.  did not even finish looking at the movie,1362355200,,123,4.217391304347826
4216111,4,B003X82D06,"If you work hard enough and long enough, you may become a legend despite your shortcomings, or perhaps because of them.  This movie gives its subject plenty of room to reveal himself in all his tacky glory.  For one thing, he gets right to the point.  If he wants pictures of somebody, he tails them till he gets the pictures -- not necessarily great portraits, but stuff the media will pay for.  The result is that he has, according to various estimates, as many as seven million prints and negatives carefully filed in his basement.  If he wants a low-maintenance landscape around his house, he installs plastic plants.  I haven't the nerve to do that myself, but I doubt that Mr. Galella gave it a second thought.

The film gives a well-balanced look at the first-amendment issues raised by Mr. Galella and paparazzi in general.  Given that celebrities need a certain amount of press attention to maintain their status and satisfy their egos, the trick becomes detecting the line between filling that need and invasion of privacy.  At this time, the paparazzi seem pretty safe in their activities as long as they stay in the streets.

It's a good idea after seeing the film on the DVD to listen to the commentary, a conversation among Mr. Galella and the filmmakers, wherein more of the photographer's philosophy is displayed.",1362009600,,1329,4.7894736842105265
4216112,4,B003X82D06,"For those interested in the Kennedy/Jackie O era, a satisfying and interesting documentary describing the well known paparazzo who followed her incessantly. Capturing his life more than hers, it is still worth watching for its matter of fact coverage of an eccentric/artist who took his trade very seriously and left us with a collection of photographs of notables that is probably unique in its portrayal of the time.",1361491200,,418,5.161764705882353
4216113,5,B003X82D06,It was a very interesting movie that gave a look into the life of a celebrity photographer.  There some very good tips on the finer points of photography.,1360800000,,154,4.5
4216114,5,B003X82D06,"This is very interesting for those who are interested in cultural history. It is history in the raw, the sights and sounds.",1357603200,,123,4.636363636363637
4216115,4,B003X82D06,"As an active pro photographer (not a paparazzi) I really enjoyed this film.  While I don't think many people are cut out to make a living in the manner that Ron Galella does, I think it is very important to understand why he and , in fact, all of us, are protected under the first amendment.  This film offers some great insights into lives and beliefs of not only photographers like Galella, but also the people they photograph.  It is also interesting to note that while many of the celebrities express annoyance at the paparazzi, the relationship between the photographers and the celebrities is really for the most part a mutually beneficial one.",1343692800,,650,4.734513274336283
4216116,4,B003X82D06,"The documentary Smash His Camera (2010), focuses on the life and career of Ron Galella, a photographer based in New York City, who made shooting celebrities his specialty, and was one of the first ""paparazzi"" type photographers in America.  The controversial Galella, who characterizes himself as a ""paparazzo superstar"", has led a colorful life.  While being mostly sympathetic to Galella's point of view, the documentary deals with some provocative issues like privacy rights and freedom of the press, providing to some extent some opposing points of view.

The presentation is interesting and sometimes dramatic, with told with a good dose of humor mixed in.  You may not like Ron Galella, but you have to admit that the man knows his business, and for good or bad, has been a pioneer in this particular type of photojournalism.

Galella began photographing celebrities in the Air Force, and as a civilian began to make his living shooting famous people.  Besides his personality, methods, and results, what eventually distinguished Galella from the pack, was his obsession with photographing fellow New Yorker Jackie Kennedy Onassis.  This eventually led to several legal battles with the former First Lady, where for a time, Galella was prohibited from getting within 50 yards of Onassis.  In another notorious incident, Galella was hit in the face by Marlon Brando, while photographing him on the street after an appearance on the Dick Cavett Show.  This also resulted in a lawsuit, in which was settled in Galella's favor.

The documentary also looks at Galella's personal life.  His home contains a massive library of his celebrity images amassed through the years, encompassing the worlds of entertainment, sports, and politics.  Now approaching 80 and in the twilight of his career, Galella looks back discussing his experiences shooting Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, and some of his other more colorful assignments.  He also provides some shooting tips in a segment called ""Ron's Rules of Paparazzi"".  Now something of a celebrity himself, business associates, legal experts, other photographers, and those in the entertainment industry are among those who offer their thoughts about the career, methods, photography, character, and significance of Ron Galella.  Interestingly, one opinion offered is that Galella is ""the price tag of the first amendment"".

The number of famous people Galella has photographed is truly staggering, and his book ""No Pictures"", features just a tiny fraction of his best images.  Galella's methods may not always be admirable, but his determination and resourcefulness, produced results that people were willing to buy.  Smash That Camera is an interesting and entertaining look at the career of a man who helped establish the mold for the modern celebrity photographer, and the more extreme subgroup known as ""paparazzi"" who are now are a fact of life for those in the news or entertainment industry.",1342828800,4,2989,5.323404255319149

8407896,4,B003X82D06,Really well done - but - I only read the title - and it's about One photographer - Ron Galella. Very interesting. Brings up a lot about the Paparazzi - and how Intrusive they can be and related complications. I'm sure a Lot of work went into the making of this film - I just think it would have been more balanced out - by showing interviews with other celebrities - of how their lives have been Negatively impacted by the paparazzi. It's More of a Biography - than a Documentary on paparazzi in general. - Still - worth seeing - and it kept  moving along. Scott M.,1452816000,,565,4.231481481481482
8407897,4,B003X82D06,Interesting look behind the lens.  Well-done documentary covering a quirky and infamous photographer.,1413072000,,101,6.769230769230769
8407898,2,B003X82D06,"There are a couple chuckles in this film about Ron Galella, a paparazzi photographer who was apparently once notorious for snapping celebrity pictures, but I've never heard of him before this bio.  The documentary looks at his life as he tracks down celebrtities, often obsessively as he breezes through stop lights and cuts around traffic in pursuit and either hides in bushes or stalks out in abandoned buildings in order to gather countless celeb photographs for the press, culminating in basements filled with cataloged boxes of celeb pics.  The film examining if he went too far with stalking the late Jackie Onassis for countless secretive photographs, resulting in media hooplah and court drama.  You sort of want to side with Galella at times as a rabbit-loving goofball, and yet it's also hard not to perceive him as an old, harassing creep. Perhaps he deserved that punch from Brando?

By the end of the film I ultimately found this to be a depressing examination of a very shallow, very pointless profession.  The most telling part of the documentary was at the end of the film, as the young woman is looking at the caller of Galella's celebrity images, mostly black and white 60's-era pics, and for the most part can't name any of the people, even showing difficulty with Robert Kennedy. I think that speaks about the shallowness being studied here: these are fleeting images often taken of unaware celebrities that will ultimately be forgotten.",1404950400,,1457,4.954918032786885
8407899,5,B003X82D06,"I stumbled upon this film and loved it. I didn't know who the photographer was initially as I was born a bit late but my mother did. We watched it together and both loved it! I found it entertaining, engaging and as it was a glimpse of a few of the real stars of an era goneby...very interesting film!!! I highly recommend it!!
