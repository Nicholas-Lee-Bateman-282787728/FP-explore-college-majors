Okay, I Bought a Mac! Now What?
#1 in the ""Macs for the Computer Shy"" series

DVD DESCRIPTION
Mac Computer sales are way up!

It could be because Macs are more secure and far less prone to viruses and ""spyware"" than Windows computers.

It could be due to the fact that Macs are simply a much better value than Windows PCs.

Or perhaps it's because people want an equally stylish computer to compliment their very cool-looking iPods and/or iPhones.

In any case, the Mac is back!

This instructional video gently guides you through the process of: setting up a new Mac computer, connecting it to the Internet, ""registering"" it, configuring the ""Apple Mail"" program to send & receive email messages, and how to actually use the gosh darn thing!

Both Apple notebook and desktop computers are covered.
