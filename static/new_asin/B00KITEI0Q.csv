6432548,4,B00KITEI0Q,"Crawl or Die is not your typical Hollywood Action/Horror movie. Yes, there are guns, explosions, and four-letter words, but the slow pace and psychological aspect make it feel more like a Japanese or Korean horror film.

The cinematography is beautiful (especially for such a low budget), and really brings out the feeling of claustrophobia. The creature design, while remnant of the late H.R. Giger's work on Alien, still manages to bring something new to the table. The dialog does get a bit muddy/echoey, but that is to be expected from the location, and I think anything cleaner may actually detract from the immersion.

No, it's not the most original story, but it is done in a new way that is quite enjoyable with the right mindset. If you are looking for boobs, blood, and Bay'splosions, keep looking, but if you want a truly immersive, claustrophobic, and terrifying experience, check out 'Crawl or Die'",1407888000,14,911,4.947712418300654
6432549,4,B00KITEI0Q,"Seriously claustrophobic! Once they climb into the tunnels/pipes, things get more and more tense. It's really well done, especially for such a low budget film.
 If you don't like low budget for whatever reason, then this might not be for you, but if you're a fan of sci-fi horror, then you should really enjoy it.
 Once they climb into the tunnels you should be hooked.

It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I'd recommend it.

6432557,2,B00KITEI0Q,"I found this movie rather slow and boring. It had an ""Alien"" type creature ( VERY reminiscent of the creatures in the Alien movies) with an insatiable appetite. I don't understand how a human-sized creature can consume 7 to 8 adult humans in one day (Or less), unless it has an EXTREMELY high metabolic rate. And Bullet Proof? BOMB Proof? REALLY? This creature follows them through the tunnels they tried to hide in, eating them one at a time.
 If you are at all claustrophobic, you may find this movie a bit much to endure. (99% of this movie takes place in tunnels of ever-decreasing size.) The world's LAST Virus-Free, Fertile woman (Referred to only as ""Package"") was rather pretty though.",1454284800,,693,4.7272727272727275

6432565,2,B00KITEI0Q,"One of the perks of being an Amazon Prime member is that I have been able to watch an awful lot of DTV films released by Uncork'd Entertainment on DVD for free. Surprisingly, a lot of them have been good to excellent, but this film, originally titled CRAWL BITCH CRAWL and made for less than $7,000, is not one of them. It's supposed to fill us with the dread of claustrophobia, but all it really does is make us look at the clock and wait for it to end. The opening looks like some found footage film, as the cameras shake and shimmy while we watch a band of Special Forces soldiers shooting at something that doesn't look human (it's really hard to make out, even when you freeze frame), while they are lowering a civilian woman down the opening of an underground tunnel and then joining her. They keep very quiet while one of the Special Forces soldiers turns the wheel to lock the surface door, while another tries to booby-trap the door, but he drops the triggering mechanism down to the ground. Instead of throwing the trigger back up to him, the alien breaks in and the soldier blows himself up, but it has no effect on the alien (Not 5 minutes into this film and I know this squad of Special Forces soldiers are nothing but a bunch of screw-ups). We are then transported seven months in the past at a mission briefing of the same Special Forces team. It seems we are in the future where a virus had made nearly all the women infertile. General Z (David Zeliff) informs the squad he has received a ""Code 455"", which means they have located two women that are fertile (a statistic so improbable to calculate, it would make any scientist roll his/her eyes in disbelief and the plot reminded me of both the Jean-Claude Van Damme film CYBORG [1989] and AMERICAN CYBORG: STEEL WARRIORS [1993], one of Cannon Films last productions), but one of the women has passed away from the virus. Their job is to escort ""The Package"" (Torey Byrne) as she is flown off the planet in the spaceship Oklahoma (an in-joke; but this film is so cheap that no spaceship is ever shown) and all will be put in cryosleep for seven months, where they will land on ""Earth 2"". The General says that all the rumors they heard are true; they are preparing a disease-free planet for habitation by non-diseased people, but it will still take four more years to finish. Since this unit has never lost a single package (hard to believe after what we witnessed in the beginning of the film), the General makes it clear that no matter how much the Package cries or complains, she must be delivered (to whom we are never told). She is to be treated like an actual package than a human being (if this is our future, stop the car, I want to get out). We are then back in the tunnels seven months later, as Special Forces leader Tank (Nicole Alonzo; one of the film's Producers and wannabe singer; she has a haircut that would never be approved by the Special Forces) leads the troops and the Package through the tunnels, which gets smaller and smaller, until the men in the squad, including Snoop (Wil Crown), Doc (Tommy Ball), Mic (Tom Chamberlain), Thumper (Larry Huitt) and over a half-dozen ""red shirts"" (A term taken from the original STAR TREK (1966 - 1969), where, if an unknown crew member was beamed down to a planet wearing a red shirt, you knew he was going to die) cannot crawl or squeeze through the opening, and try to find an alternate means to their destination (which we still don't know), while Tank strips down to her underwear and has the Package crawl in front of her. I know we are supposed to get a severe case of claustrophobia, but all we really get is a case of severe case of boredom and hope that the camera gives us another crotch shot of Tank. The alien (played by Matthew Crabtree, who also designed the creature suit and plays one of the red shirt Special Forces members) grabs the Package and takes off down the tiny tunnels, with Tank trying to follow them. When she finally gets to a chamber, we don't see the Package (the alien probably ate her, but that is just speculation on my part), so her team finds a way to pull her up from the chamber and Tank sets the alien on fire (the film is so cheap, we don't even see the creature suit on fire). So much for their unit never losing a package and they have probably killed all mankind. While the alien is following the two and then grabs the Package, all we get is nothing but a short view of it during the finale, where it looks like a cross between ALIEN (1979) and FORBIDDEN WORLD (1982). This entire film, directed/co-produced/screenwritten/set designed (I bet that cost him $50)/co-photographed by Oklahoma Ward, picked a pretty poor film to make as his feature film debut (all he did was short films before this). The closest I can come to describe it is one of those cheap 80's & 90's Roger Corman productions (like THE TERROR WITHIN - 1988), but at least Corman's films gave us blood, gore and creatures we can actually see and not the quick-cutting one second shots of blood, gore, the creature and always shaking camera that Ward offers us here. There are lengthy periods of no dialogue, just a droning background noise that induces headaches (I swear my 5.1 Dolby Stereo System was crying!) and a whole lot of unanswered questions (How did a huge alien drag the Package through such tight areas? What is Earth 2 doing with an underground tunnel system and what purpose does it serve? Is the alien a resident of Earth 2 or did it follow them to stop Earth people from continuing to exist? How did the virus start? Was it man made, alien made or a natural occurrence?). There are so many unanswered questions in this film that a book can be written about them and don't go looking for answers (not even what happened to the Package), because you will get none. I am always willing to give directors a second chance, but the next film Oklahoma Ward directs better be something spectacular. Even though it cost under $7,000 to make, that is no excuse. SKINLESS (2013) was made for less than $2,000 and held me spellbound. This film just held me prisoner and all of Tank's scenes are filmed with a sickly blue filter for no other reason than his digital camera allowed it. If you like your action in one second edits, gore in even less time and never a really good look at the alien, you may like this film (you poor b***ard). I actually had a better time brushing my cats than watching this cheap excuse as an 80's throwback film. No nudity, no really discernible blood or gore (thanks to the quick editing) and no answered questions. After the end credits it says ""Tank will return soon."" Let's hope not. God, let's hope not.

6432576,1,B00KITEI0Q,"Spoiler alert

You will watch Nicole Alonso crawling through a tube for about 40 minutes. While that in itself could be appealing as she is an attractive women, the camera uses a light to show off her hind quarters in an intrusive manner. The plot needs more development and more background. For example, adding a scene explaining and showing the chaos of the ""disease"" would be pretty important. Cutting about 20 minutes of the butt following crawling through tunnels scenes with things that show what the captions say would make things more interesting. I understand this is considered low budget, but that does not mean the movie should just be about how badass tank and her butt is. Show the community what makes her tough. Crawling through a tunnel does not show that. Also the trap door just openning at the right time with soldiers on top. Also they did not seem vety upset that the package was lost and instead say she is soo tough. My final comment, surviving the alien is good, but at the cost of the last fertile women in existence is very bad. T",1438214400,2,1057,4.592592592592593

6432589,4,B00KITEI0Q,"Let me say right up front that I do not enjoy tight spaces. Never have and never will. Watching Crawl or Die reminded me why I have such an aversion to being confined in super small spaces. In many ways its a lot like Buried, little to no room to maneuver, no way to easily get out, and constant fear that something will cause the space to get smaller crushing me to death. Well you get the idea

If Crawl or Die is trying to make the audience uncomfortable it does a pretty good job. A single location film shot on what I can only assume is a micro-budget, the movie follows an elite security team who are trying to rescue the last fertile female from Earth II. Things go wrong during the extraction and the team end up underground in a series of tunnels. To make matter worse whatever derailed their carefully laid plans is following them, and is very very hungry.

This is an interesting movie. On one hand its a survival film that does a great job ratcheting up the tension as the movie moves forward. On the other hand there is almost no storyline. Limited exposition isn't a bad thing. Ive argued before that a lot of movies suffer from an overload of backstory, making them less enjoyable because they rob the viewer of any chance to use their imaginations. Crawl or Die goes in the opposite direction. There is one small scene that provides context for why the group is there and what the mission is, and thats it. Unfortunately, the dialogue is a bit pedestrian and doesnt do much through the rest of the film to add anything. Literally no subtext at all. Hardly any character development, which I can give a pass on because its not the type of movie where development is key to success.

The main teammember Tank, played by Nicole Alonso, is the focal point of pretty much the entire film. She does a decent job of carrying the movie, showcasing how physically challenging crawl or die is while trying to save The Package, played by Torey Byrne.

I have to hand it to writer/director Oklahoma Ward, hes created a decent movie with almost no premise or budget. the limited special effects are well handled and gruesome enough to make you not want to be in the tunnel, a hungry alien right on your ass.
For what it is the movie is enjoyable and fun. Its starts off like gangbusters throwing you right into the action. Things then simmer down a bit and once settled in it becomes a tense slow crawl to the finish line.",1433894400,,2425,4.430493273542601

You're given a brief explanation of where they are and why they are there... to get the last fertile woman on Earth 1 and take her to Earth 2. She is referred to as ""the Package"" throughout the whole movie... They don't even give her the decency of a name. So she's supposed to repopulate Earth - be the savior of mankind - And we'll call her ""package"". They don't even let us know if she's coming along willingly or being taken against her will. The film is way too dark. Yeah, I get it - they're supposed to be climbing through underground tunnels without anything but flashlights... but most action scenes are so dark and so spliced it's difficult to figure out what is happening. There's no chemistry established between the characters... the fact that most of them die early in the movie makes that impossible. The creature is rarely seen... And when dimly revealed twice... It's an ""Alien"" rip-off... Same structure, same build... really not much difference. The main character ""Tank"" is basically wearing a tube top, hot clinging shorts and boots that come up to her knees. Really??? This is the way to dress for an excursion on a known hostile planet? Seems like the director wanted to objectify women... The one female character is a ""package"", the other dressed like a hooker on the job. The movie is 95% of people crawling through tunnels away from a creature that never stops growling. There's maybe 5% action. And the dialogue is basically ""Move"", ""Go"", ""Wait"".

The movie has a good creature and good scenes for those suffering from claustrophobia. However, it fall very short of what ""The Descent"" did.

I didn't buy the setup ""The package"" is the last surviving fertile female and this Crack-Pop team that ""never ever lost a mission"" {Should BOLD THAT } was the only one that could deliver ""The Package"". Well, the team starts loosing everything in the first 5 minutes of the battle. In the first 15 minutes everybody except for Tank, Doctor, and ""The Package"" are just dead. They escape through a tunnel which by the way had the outer door fused before moving onward.
To make the long story short, the 3 make it down to an ever shrinking tunnel system when the only person left is Tank. So much for the Team that never lost.

6432607,4,B00KITEI0Q,Different.  Very low budget and in some respects it is obvious.  Where the film excels is in the feeling of helplessness and claustrophobia.  Nearly the entire film is set in a series of underground tunnels and the director does a great job getting the viewer to empathize with the characters.  There is a constant sense of fear and dread as the protagonists are fleeing from the scary alien-rip-off-beastie.  There is very little character development but the lead actress has enough screen presence and charisma to carry the fairly short film.  While not very intellectually compelling the film is very effective at drawing you in to the setting and is worth the roughly 1.5 hours of your time.,1428451200,,696,4.905982905982906
6432608,5,B00KITEI0Q,"At first, I almost stopped this video and didn't watch it. By the looks of it, I thought it was going to be too ""B movie-ish"" for me. The sound is real time, at first seeming very cheap, no professional over dubbing or anything (when they get into the the tunnels, this point becomes moot as you are right in the actors face) it made it kind of hard to understand what the actors were saying as the video starts off. There was very little background or story building; leaping straight away into the tunnels. The plot was simple: Get the last fertile woman left on the planet and get her from point A to point B.  Perhaps that was best because it kept me from passing on Crawl Or Die. So how did I go from almost passing on it to five stars? BECAUSE,  suddenly, I was horrified as I watched these actors jump into these ever constricting, consecutively more chocking, tunnels. Arg! I could feel my lungs squeezing as I watched! To say I am claustrophobic is a monumental understatement, and this movie played right on my greatest fear. Some people are afraid of the dark or afraid of clowns, there are a million phobias. Well, watching Tank (the lithe, muscular, blond with the mowhawk) squeeze through tunnels the size of gopher holes made my eyes wide, and I caught myself all tensed and my fists clinched!

6432628,2,B00KITEI0Q,"Crawl or Die is a micro budget scifi/horror film that had some initial promise. But unfortunately it ends of being more repetitive and predictable than anything else. Mind you as a ""no budget"" film maker Im always interested in seeing what can be done with little or no money. Because of this Ive discovered some real gems but Ive also seen too many films that just didn't cut it. This is one such case. Firstly let me praise the filmmakers for being ingenious with their limited resources. A very shallow depth of field in the flash backs hides the lack of quality locations, and main action for the film was intensely claustrophobic and only gets more so as the story progresses.  Their are some good shots, some creative camera work, and some damn dedicated actresses in this film to be sure.

The major issues start with the story, nothing really wrong at fist, like many horror flicks the idea is simple. In some future time humanity has become beset by a virus which has rendered all women on Earth infertile but one. However mankind has prepared a new planet for colonization called Earth 2. Well there's the first issue. The woman (only ever referred to as the Package, even to her face) is never defined as the last woman of our species. Are there more one Earth 2? Because its biologically impossible for one woman to produce enough offspring to save the human race from genetic degradation. But skipping that we move on. Earth 2 was deemed habitable for human colonization apparently being termed ""blue"" but somewhere along the way before our heroes actually start moving to their new home the team with the package is assaulted by some sort of alien alpha predator. Now why they couldn't just land at the base if they have the ability for interstellar flight is never explained, but instead they had to land miles away and hike in.

The crux of the film is that to avoid the hostile creature (which is quite clearly a rip off of the Alien films and even recreates a number of moments from the series including its vulnerability to fire) the team has to seek passage through an underground tunnel system. The cast is picked off one by one and the tunnels get so small its painful to watch. However gripping it is to start with though it just ends up dragging on and on. This is no Ti West slow burn, instead it becomes monotonous, so much so that I got bored enough to nearly fall asleep. The film could easily be half its current runtime. In the end, the mission utterly fails, everyone dies except the badass chick Tank (who tears off all of her pants to make hand bandages for one person just so you can see her ass for most of the movie) and the team who saves her never bemoans the fact that our race is doomed to extinction since the package is dead.

I give it 2 stars instead of one only because it did have some tense and effective moments, some decent FX for a micro budget flick and one hell of an actress in Tank, not so much for acting ability (her best scenes are when she isn't speaking, she was great at conveying emotion then) but for her sheer courage and determination to tackle some really physically aurdurous scenes. I would actually give it an extra star if I could watch the a behind the scenes segment as Id love to know how they managed to do some of the more difficult tunnel shots.",1426550400,2,3320,4.473597359735973

The lead however is very compelling. Once you get past the mandatory exposition beginning scenes this becomes a rather well put together scifi DTV.

One reviewer said this was the most claustrophobic film they ever saw. DUDE I TOTALLY AGREE! if you're not claustrophobic you will be. Those tunnel sequences will haunt my dreams.

She was very believable and was a perfect choice for the physical demands of the role. As an ex-military person with over 8 yrs experience I found myself pondering just how many people I know that could've pulled off crawling through so many tunnels, dirt, bugs, etc. The answer is none, myself included. The scenes where the crawl spaces become smaller and smaller were insane; those scenes give the viewer claustrophobia! Imagine if you will what it must've been like for the soldiers they deemed ""tunnel rats"" in the military during the Vietnam War, crawling through a maze of tunnels and knowing that impending doom/death was nearby. This movie successfully captures that feeling. Kudos to the director, actors, and everyone who brought this film to life.  -John Steel",1426204800,,1124,4.7055837563451774
6432632,3,B00KITEI0Q,"Crawl or Die is a movie I was intrigued by, and a movie I really wanted to like, with a solid 'gimmick' but lackluster execution.

Review contains spoilers.

What little exposition there is tells us that a group of soldiers is escorting the last fertile women on Earth to a back-up planet, Earth 2. For some reason, they are driven underground, and what ensues for the next ~90 minutes is a claustrophobic crawl through increasingly shrinking underground tunnels and away from an insectile predator which seemingly cannot be stopped.

First the good: As someone who is claustrophobic, the movie does a great job of this. The tone is set very well in the beginning of the movie, as a majority of it is done with little or not speech, and as the tunnels start to close in from one to the next, I was feeling uncomfortable, which is a major win for any horror movie; being able to reach the viewer and convey its unease.

Unfortunately, the rest is lacking, and once you stray too far form this central theme, the movie unravels as a mess.

SPOILERS BELOW, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

Firstly, the virus. OVT. The way it's treated seems contradictory. In the intro, it is said that OVT makes women infertile, but then we also learn that the second fertile women on Earth has died. Was it from OVT? Was it something else? if OVT specifically targets and kills women, then it raises a lot of dubious questions about Tank, the female protagonist form the team of soldiers who is not the package (read: last fertile women) but also not dead.

After the films briefing sequence, we cut suddenly to the team of Soldiers fleeing in the dead of night from something which is never made clear. First and foremost, it's never made clear if this is still on Earth, or on Earth 2. The briefing says they'll be dropped near a wooded area, so I would assume Earth 2, but the movie seems very unconcerned with details of any kind and this consistently bothered me throughout the movie. The soldiers find a completely buried metal hatch in the ground (how did they know it was there?) and haphazardly decide to drop into it. As a civilian with no military training or experience, the logic behind this is lost on me and seems like a terrible idea. What if it was a dead end?

From here, most of the cast is rapidly killed-off, and the movie just pushes the claustrophobia angle to the max, which is does pretty well, to be fair. There is a scene where one of the soldiers wires the first hatch with explosives, and when the creature finally appears and drops down, he utters a line like ""What the hell is that?"" From the frantic opening, I would assume they knew what was chasing them? Or was it something else, and this monster is a new addition? This kind of confusing double-speak is common in the movie and easily the most gripe-worthy thing I found while watching.

So, Tank, the package, and the doctor carry on for a bit until the doctor is axed off, leaving only Tank and the package. They continue to crawl in even tighter confines until, most of the way through the movie, the package dies. I did warn you about those spoilers... Anyway, at this point, the movie was kind of over for me, as the mission had failed. Tank eventually reaches a large chamber with a hatch at the top too high to climb too and prepares to showdown with the monster when help finally arrive and pulls her up. They very non-nonchalantly identify and then kill the monster with fire (it's immune to bullets.....?) and one of the soldiers that rescued her comments that Tank is the toughest mother you'll ever meet, etc. Block text declares that ""Tank Will Return!""

And at this anti-climax, after the claustrophobia hook has abated, is when my mind slowly picks apart the movie and I feel disappointed. Not only the flaws I've already mentioned, but much of the tunnel system is made of metal and concrete walls, meaning it was build. Who the built such a tunnel system of nothing which leads nowhere? Is this on Earth or Earth 2? If the latter, I guess I could imagine this was some kind of indigenous lifeform that escaped cursory evaluations. How did the resume soldiers know where to find Tank? On top of that, when you see the creature in earnest, it's obvious it's too large to fit through the spaces that Tank did because of it's large head, dorsal spines reminiscent of the xenomorph, etc, which errects a doting doubt of the events that transpired.

And of course for me, the biggest issue. The last fertile female of the human race is dead. All human life is doomed. But Tank will return, so fear not. If there is a sequel to this movie, I can't imagine what i could be about or why I would want to watch it, as the last home for humanity was bludgeoned to death in ~90 minutes of footage. Although there is some triumph in Tank surviving, the movie ends on a definite low note, and the movie's own attempt to hype itself up falls on deaf ears.

TL;DR It's worth a watch for the atmosphere, especially for free on Amazon Prime, but the poor exposition and explanation alongside the movies many plot-holes and logical inconsistencies will leave a bad taste in your mouth and deter a second viewing.",1426204800,,5167,4.526259378349411

6432639,4,B00KITEI0Q,"My brain is broken.

I saw the cover for Crawl and Die and my brain went  Hot chick on a cover! Hot chick looks animated, therefore this film is animated. Basically my brain was being an idiot, which is a nice way of saying that I was being an idiot. This is not an animated film, the whole thing is live action. Which means that the staring actress, Nicole Alonso, exists in real life. Thats something that should warm your heart!

The story goes like this  Tank, the woman on the cover, is part of a team of mercenaries that are sent to a planet to rescue the package. The package is a fertile woman. Once they have the package they are chased by a monster that slowly picks them off. As they are escaping they venture deeper into a tunnel system where every tunnel is smaller than the last.

The Good

Crawl or Die is billed as the most claustrophobic movie ever made. Thats because its true. I thought that the Ryan Reynolds film Buried would be the winner of that category for all time but its been unseated. We have a new champion! Seriously, Crawl or Die brings claustrophobia to a whole new level. The further Tank goes to escape, the smaller the tunnels get. Just when you think that it cant get any worse, it gets worse. And not just a little worse.

Im not usually a claustrophobic fellow, but this film had me ready to claw my skin off. It had ignited some primal fear within me that I felt that my usually adequate sized living room was too small. I had to stand up when the film ended just to stretch out and move my arms, and if there wasn't subzero temperatures outside I would have gone to stand in my yard.

Even now as I write about Crawl or Die my skin is feeling too tight and all the feelings of dread and panic of being too enclosed are flooding back. This film will haunt me for years to come, and it might be a very long time before I can even climb inside the likes of a sleeping bag again!

The Bad

The beginning of Crawl or Die was a wreak. I had no idea what was going on  people were making numskull decisions, the visuals were a mess of shadows and closeups, and there was little to no dialogue. Im lenient with Indy films and so I give them some leeway but if this was a major release I would have shut it off before things got going. That would have been a pity.

The Verdict

Crawl or Die delivers so hard on its promise of being the most claustrophobic movie ever made that all its sins are forgiven. The best horrors are the ones that burrows inside your mind to hang out, Crawl or Die has dug so deep that its become a permanent resident.",1420588800,15,2576,4.190283400809717

8659328,1,B00KITEI0Q,"Some movies are bad.  Others are in a special category of bad.  Crawl or Die belongs in that special category.  Let's talk about all the major flaws.

The movie begins with a generic action scene showing a security team shooting at something in the darkness, and this lasts several minutes.  We can't see anything because the picture's really dark.  All we can see is an explosion.  Then comes the *excruciatingly* long tunnel climbing segment.  For 10 minutes the team crawls as slow as possible.  With such a long-winded scene happening early on, and with no character introduction so we don't care about anybody or what happens to them, this scene is incredibly painful to watch.  Then finally a monster pops up... at least I think.  Again the picture's too dark to see.

Then the one member of the security team -the girl with the wavy blonde hair and the only member of the team I care about simply because her hairstyle makes her stand out- crawls through the tunnel alone.  NOT AGAIN!  Not another looooong tunnel crawl!  She falls asleep in the tunnel.  I fall asleep too.  We both wake up when an alien monster pops out of the bottom.  It's unfathomable that after 10 minutes of long tunnel climbing the writers thought it would be okay to show the woman get back into the tunnel and climb through again, but unfortunately this is just the beginning.

We finally see the alien monster.  The darkness lets up long enough on one occasion to make out what's after the team.  It's an alien, and it chew apart one of the team members.  The woman with the blonde hair and another female sit in the tunnel for the longest time discussing what to do next.  They crawl again.  For 10 or more minutes the other female of the group is either crawling or stuck in the tunnel.  Can't really tell.  She grabs dirt and tries to progress but all we see are her desperate moving hands and her struggling moans.  After all that struggling the alien manages to crawl through and attack her.  It uses its tentacle to slap her head up and kill her.

The wavy-haired blonde girl is the last survivor.  A true test of patience comes next- a very long period (like over 30 minutes) of watching her continue to climb through the tunnel with the sound of an alien approaching closer and closer.  She snaps her arm on something and falls down.  If her flashlight had broken guess how dark the picture would be then?  Let's not think about that!  She continues crawling and digging.  The piano indicates she's about to reach the surface.  By this point I'm pullin' for ya baby!  You made me watch all the way up to this point so yeah, just free yourself and run away from this movie, er... monster.  Don't get eaten by that alien or I'll be ticked that I had to wait so long, ya hear?

Well she doesn't reach the top yet.  She finds herself in an open area with a metal pole to use as a weapon.  She waits for the monster to come up the tunnel.  She can't go anywhere and becomes trapped.  The monster reveals itself... at least I think.  I see slime dripping.  She grabs a rope and someone pulls her to the surface while the alien almost grabs her ankle.  She's saved!  She wants to be the one to throw a stick of dynamite while the alien patiently wakes for his demise.  He is after all, the slowest monster in history.  He must be a sloth beast.

The other security members ask who she is, and the other says ""One of the toughest chicks you'll ever know"".  When he asks for her name suddenly giant letters that say ""Tank!"" fill up the screen.  That's almost as cheesy as earlier when the blonde girl screams ""Crawl!"" and the word ""Crawl"" appears on screen.  At least being determined to make it to the surface gives her a little bit of character.  Just a little though, and unintentionally.

It's not a good sign when the only interesting moment is when the military officer gives orders, and this happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie.  The team's objective is to secure a package to a transport and find the last virus-free girl but... this never happens.  We never see the girl.  We see overlong tunnel crawling instead.  Wow, and I had the audacity to criticize found footage horrors since most of them are really bad.  This however, is worse.  At least found footage films actually go somewhere and jump around from one area to another.  Then again is this really that much different from a found footage movie?  It's basically the same with the uninteresting characters and no horror.  At least Crawl or Die tries to have suspense, even if it fails for me personally.

I can't believe someone thought basing an entire movie around crawling through tight claustrophobic areas was a good idea.  Apparently though, some people think there's a lot of suspense taking place here so what do I know?  Maybe I have it all wrong.  Maybe the writers were trying to present a realistic scenario of somebody climbing through a tunnel to safety, and the long tiring process it takes to reach the end.",1500336000,,4984,4.512331838565022

8659331,4,B00KITEI0Q,"If Ridley Scott had $350.00 to make Alien, and he was late on his car payment this is what it may have looked like. Skip the first 17 minutes entirely as you don't have a clue what's going on. From that point, most of the ""cast"" is dead already and it becomes a movie shot entirely in a drainage culvert. The Alien is completely impervious to bullets yet they keep stopping to see if it's about to eat another one of them instead of just keep on moving. I gave it four stars because although obviously a minuscule budget, the production crew did made the best of it. Its gets more claustrophobic as it goes, and it's entertaining enough to make it worth while. By the end it the best never say die performance I've ever seen from a woman on film. Also, you just gotta love Nicole Alonso's soldier outfit.",1485734400,,804,4.33112582781457

8659334,4,B00KITEI0Q,"I almost passed on watching this, but I'm glad I didn't. You start out thinking OK so this is discount Aliens. A bunch of commandos led by a tough chick get dropped in a hole and battle a very HR Geigerish alien creature and start getting picked off. Then all of a sudden the movie does something amazing. As the tunnels get smaller and the situation gets more dire, your skin starts to crawl and it starts working on every claustrophobic nerve you have. I'm not claustrophobic at a all and ""Tank's"" underground flight from the big nasty actually made me feel what she was feeling. I wanted to get out of those damn tunnels as bad as she did lol . Tank is played by Nicole Alonso. Get it? She's called Tank because she's tough. Or maybe it's because she fights in a tank top and panties, but if I have to watch numerous scenes of someone's crotch and ass wiggling through a tunnel I'm just glad it was her and not Ving Rhames or something. And that's another good thing. It isn't the typical hot girl knows Kung fu and spin kicks the big bad to death scenario. Tank is able to survive because she's small enough to fit her hot little ass through the damn tunnel.",1476489600,,1162,4.310502283105023
8659335,5,B00KITEI0Q,"This movie is not about the story, or the acting. It is about being trapped in tighter and tighter spaces with no way back and no idea what lies ahead. This movie had me pulling my hair out. I literally had to pause this movie several times and step outside. I love claustrophobic movies, like being buried alive and such. If you like being trapped, then this movie is for you.",1475539200,,377,4.323943661971831
8659336,5,B00KITEI0Q,"This is the first movie I watched on Amazon Prime, six moths ago. I thought it was good, and unique. Since then I have watched many movies on Prime (we only have basic cable and I can't stand commercials, so most of my time is spent on Prime) and I just rewatched this movie with my wife. I have to say, that even though the plot at the beginning is confusing, please stick with it, and put down you phone or any other distraction. This is one of the top ten best and original movies I have watched on Prime. Just put down the distractions, don't pause it, don't fast forward it... and you will find it very suspenseful. It will haunt your memories.",1470700800,,649,4.241935483870968
