5572048,5,B00BC0JFLC,"The Movie, Wisdom of Changes by Bettina Wilhelm, is one of those amazing films which gives the history of a man who spent more than 20 years as a Christian missionary in China, but who never converted one person to Christianity.  He became deeply immersed in the old Chinese Culture and worked with a Chinese scholar to translate the I Ching, The Book of Changes, into German.  From the German it was translated into English where the book of divination has become a profound and popular book.  Bettina Wilhelm, his granddaughter and a professional film maker and who never met her grandfather decided that she wanted to know more about her famous grandfather.  The result is this wonderful DVD which originally came out in German but is now available in English.  It is the story of a deeply introverted and spiritual man in his search to find his own soul. His main work in China is from the turn of the 20th century until the early 1920's,  He returns to Germany after World War I and joins a group of scholars including C.G. Jung.  The two of  them become close colleagues and friends as Jung becomes a student of the I Ching.  The I Ching has had a profound influence on my life from the age of 17 on, which is almost 60 years ago. I cannot recommend it any higher.  five stars.",1363737600,14,1283,4.467811158798283
8565577,5,B00BC0JFLC,This film by Wilhelm's daughter gives great insight to the man and his profound love for China and ancient Chinese wisdom. His translation of the I Ching is peerless. His aggressive reverence toward it made him a superconductive channel for nuance found in no other translation.,1476662400,,278,5.065217391304348

8565580,3,B00BC0JFLC,Wilhelm's translation of the I Ching holds a special place in my heart.  I bought my copy over twenty years ago and still refer to it this day.  I was excited to learn that his grand daughter documented his life on film.  I looked forward to a glimpse of the man who undertook the enormous task during turbulent times of not only translating the text but building a bridge toward understanding the mindset of the east. The film offers rare images of both Germany and turn of the century China and paints a picture of Wilhelm's contributions to the nation and the world.  The audience will need to be satisfied with content rather than cinematography.  The film itself isn't visually striking nor is the soundtrack compelling.  On the whole the film is very much a loving hands at home approach to telling his story.  In a way this makes it all the more appealing to those who've asked the same questions about the man as I have.  To those unfamiliar with the man or his work the film may not strike any chords or piqu enough curiosity to sustain interest from beginning to end.,1422057600,2,1077,4.515463917525773

8565582,4,B00BC0JFLC,"While this DVD is a special treat for those to whom THE I CHING is a blessing and a wonder, it may also be ""too much information"" for others who are not deeply involved in Taoism, or Chinese literature, or the history of a well-respected work of scholarship. That said, it is a powerful history and biography.",1396224000,,309,4.43859649122807
8565583,5,B00BC0JFLC,"I consider this to be  the most important film ever made on the subject of the I Ching and its translator, Richard Wilhelm. In examining Wilhelm's character and relationship to the Chinese people we are led to  a deeper understanding of this wise and ancient Chinese sacred text and of the culture from which it emerged. Bettina Wilhelm is outstanding as a director for her family relationship with Richard Wilhelm allows us to gain insights that would be overlooked from a more impersonal perspective. I would highly recommend this film to any student or practitioner of the I Ching as well as to anyone who is seeking a deeper insight into Chinese philosophy and civilization and into the history and usage of the I Ching - The Book of Changes.",1391299200,2,746,4.730769230769231
8565584,5,B00BC0JFLC,I have studied I Ching and never knew about the beginnings of how this topic got from China to the west. This was a great project and important to pass along to future generations. Thanks for contributing to the spiritual world.,1388966400,,228,4.585365853658536
8565585,5,B00BC0JFLC,"First off, this version of the film is completely in English (not subtitled) except for a couple of short interviews of a German professor with voiceover in English.
Bettina Wilhelm goes back to China to search her grandfather's (and hers, she was born in Shanghai) roots. She is excellent at communicating the pull that China has on those who have family history there. China can exert a subtle influence that can extend even to the third generation, and Ms Wilhelm truly captures the flavor of that attraction.
Ms Wilhelm is a professional filmmaker, and the excellent production values along with great storytelling at just the right pace make for fascinating viewing.
There is a lot of archival film footage (versus stills) from the early part of the century, which I appreciate in a documentary. The original sites are visited, but this is not a film about places and dates, though those are included. Rather, this is a journey into the interior life of Richard Wilhelm, and by drawing upon his diaries and writings, Ms Wilhelm has captured the essence of her grandfather's being. One comes away with the impression that Richard Wilhelm was chosen for the task of bringing the I Ching to the west. Other translations preceded his, and many more have been done since, but none have surpassed his work as a whole.
The entire film is superbly done, and everyone will enjoy it whether or not one has an interest in the I Ching.",1372464000,9,1428,4.7854251012145745
8565586,5,B00BC0JFLC,"This documentary was very illuminating about Jung's relationship with Wilhelm, and hits at the heart of the roots of today's spiritual revolution occurring in the west.",1366416000,6,168,5.5
