And he fixes that beautifully here in a Broadway-worthy theatrical presentation that should keep everyone glued to the action on screen.

3098828,5,B0012UQIW6,"The theatricality of this life performance of Manon on DVD is amazing. Paterson's idea to update Manon into the 50s is the creation of a genius with so many metaphors and symbolism. Like many sixteen-year-old girls, Manon dreams of becoming a movie star for fame, prosperity and the ""good"" life. The presence of cameras on stage from the beginning gives a physical glimpse of her dreams. And every bobby soxer dreams of the day she'll put on sheer hosiery with the sexy seam in the back. The black magic-marker line Manon inscribes on the back of her nude sexy leg is a raw manifestation of her subconscious desire that Paterson captures to
perfection.
What about the music? After all, Manon is an opera. Personally, Manon is not one of my favorite operas. The first two acts, musically speaking, are rather tedious and tenuous. The heavy dramatic singing picks up later and if it's well sung, it makes Manon a heavyweight and a tearjerker. Netrebko's Manon, with the help of Paterson's intelligent direction,
projects the character's flaws, immaturity and shallowness with honesty that makes you feel sorry for her. And her singing? Netrebko's in total command with unbelievable either playful or dramatic color. And her death scene in the end is destined for posterity. Netrebko not only sings and acts well but she even dies better!
Villazon is in excellent form with secure top but he appears to be a liitle cautious with the size of his sound. He and Netrebko make the ""dream team"" one more time, as this production shows; and this DVD is highly recommended. The sound of the orchestra is underpowered at times, maybe due to a little sluggishness from the podium.

3098829,5,B0012UQIW6,"Anna Netrebko creates another magical performance as Manon in this updated production from Berlin. Originally performed in Los Angeles, the production then travelled to Berlin in 2007.

Anna Netrebko adds Manon to a list of amazing roles she has created on stage. Set in 1950's Paris, Manon is cast as a glamourous actress. Her coloratura is as beautiful as she is in a range of gorgeous period gowns. At one point she is pole dancing in a gold lame gown while singing some beautiful notes. Simply astonishing!!

Rolando Villazon is again superb in the role of the student Des Grieux. His beautiful sound serves Massenet's music very well.

You will regret not getting this DVD. It does not get any better than this. This simply is a must have DVD for anyone who collects opera on DVD.",1220918400,53,785,4.7153284671532845

I don't think her coloratura was that good. Her singing was lacking something. But, her acting was perfect. The moment she and Rolando were on stage it was beautiful and heart breaking. For the whole production and the rest of the cast is a full 5 stars but, because of the singing from Netrebko I gave this score a 3 stars.

3098832,5,B0012UQIW6,"What happens when a beautiful soprano singing next to a great tenor? We have a great opera, this conclusion may seem obvious, but not always exceptional singers together make great operas. There has to be chemistry, they must be free to show its full potential. In this version of Manon Massanet have an explosion of elements, all positive, all exciting, all lead to a great show.

Anna Netrebko has been prominent in the opera scene by physical beauty, her stage presence is contagious grown men and women. The dramatic acting, great actress, you know to capture the feeling of the character and express it. The voice of beautiful timbre, lyrical, a little dark, powerful, well designed. A Russian singer has all the elements of a great modern soprano, voice, acting and physical beauty.

Are very comfortable in Manon, ask the French accent, but it goes unnoticed when we hear arias: Adieu, notre petite table or Obissons, quand leur voix appelle. From naive girl on the way to the convent for the consecration in Paris (Part one emerging unforgettable) and decay in prison. It demonstrated very convincingly by a superb performance. This is a modern singer, that's twenty-first century opera, a union of elements of art. It renews and attracts public.

The Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon follows the same standards of quality, his Le Chevaliers Des Grieux evolves young, naive and full of love for a grown man and bitter. His voice tries to follow the evolution of the character, the lyrical passages does very well in the dramatic pieces missing weight. It works well alongside the protagonist, embodies the character, is comfortable in the role, rather than the previous version with Natalie Dessay in Paris, 2007.

Comprimrios The highlights are: Christof Fischesser makes Le Comte des Grieux, paper down voluminous voice. He is too young, just remember the father of the protagonist and his voice is more baritone that down. The Lescaut Afredo Dasa baritone voice is clear with good musicianship and performance.

Daniel Baremboin is a fashionable pianist and conductor of world renown, is governed by orchestras all over the world. I always thought it better on the piano. In Berlin Staatskapelle baton of their time are too slow, perhaps to help the singers to interpret, but no breath! But that makes the reading of the work monotonous, sometimes tiring, arias that excite the public are little applause. Loses to music, get the theater.

The direction of Vincent Paterson captures the essence of the work of Massanet, does not sit, modernizes the reading. Carries the work to Paris for 50 years, with train arriving Manon, parties at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and the grace of Hotel Transilvania are dynamic elements. Explores the dramatic potential of the singers, move them without exaggeration. The perfect light, help and encourage, directors this time is understood, had the same design. Costumes consistent with the time chosen, flawless, perfect finish, in the city carry light from the 50's. This opera is introducing a new variable, makeup, never seen work so well executed. Choir or are impeccably costumed actors, with the advent of high definition make-up gave a leap.

Comparing the first Manon I attended with Edita Gruberova letter of 1983 in Vienna with the newly released Netrebko, there is an evolution, such as opera recordings have changed in those 25 years. The opera is theater that corner, the VHS are in high definition DVD, the productions are infinitely more whimsical, resemble a large theater or Broadway productions. We have interviews with actors and directors, choice of chapters and a booklet with the article and summary of the opera, all in English of course.

Vocally I prefer with Manon Gruberova or with Beverly Sills in 1977 in New York City Opera. The Manon of Netrebko and Villazon back a new language, modern, current, charismatic. In the era of Internet, digital music, speed, use disposable, opera seems an aberration. But she finds a way, renewing the public and will always be reborn as Phoenix.

Paris  uma festa!

O que acontece quando um belo soprano canta ao lado de um grande tenor? Temos uma grande pera, essa concluso pode parecer bvia, mas nem sempre excepcionais cantores juntos fazem grandes peras. Tem que haver qumica, eles tem que estar  vontade para mostrar todo o potencial. Nessa verso da Manon de Massanet temos uma exploso de elementos, todos positivos, todos empolgantes, todos levam a um grande espetculo.

  Anna Netrebko tem se destacado no cenrio lrico pela beleza fsica, sua presena no palco contagia marmanjos e senhoras. Pela atuao dramtica, grande atriz, sabe captar o sentimento do personagem e express-lo. Pela voz, de timbre belo, lrico, um pouco escuro, potente, bem projetado. A cantora russa tem todos os elementos de um grande soprano moderno, voz, atuao e beleza fsica.

  Est muito a vontade em Manon, peca no sotaque francs, mas isso passa despercebido quando ouvimos suas rias: Adieu,notre petite table ou Obissons , quand leur voix appelle. De menina ingnua a caminho do convento para a consagrao em Paris (Faz uma emergente inesquecvel)  e a decadncia na priso. Tudo demonstrado com muita convico atravs de uma atuao soberba. Isso  uma cantora moderna, isso  pera do sculo XXI, uma unio de elementos da arte. Isso renova e atrai publico.

  O tenor mexicano Rolando Villazn segue o mesmo padro de qualidade, seu Le Chevaliers Des Grieux  evolui de jovem, ingnuo e cheio de amor para um homem maduro e amargurado. Sua voz tenta acompanhar a evoluo do personagem, nas passagens lricas se sai muito bem, nas partes dramticas falta peso. Atua bem ao lado da protagonista, incorpora o personagem, est a vontade no papel, melhor que na verso anterior com Natalie Dessay em Paris , 2007.

  Os comprimrios de destaque so: Christof Fischesser faz Le Comte des Grieux , papel para baixo de voz encorpada. Ele  jovem demais, pouco lembra o pai do protagonista e sua voz est mais para bartono que para baixo. O Lescaut de Afredo Dasa  bartono de voz clara com boa musicalidade e atuao.

  Daniel Baremboin  um badalado pianista e maestro de renome mundial, rege orquestras pelos quatro cantos do mundo. Sempre achei ele melhor no piano. Na batuta da Staatskapelle Berlim seus tempos so excessivamente lentos, talvez seja para ajudar os cantores a interpretarem, seno haja flego! Mas isso torna a leitura da obra montona, as vezes cansativa, rias que empolgam o publico so pouco ovacionadas. Perde a msica, ganha o teatro.

  A direo de Vincent Paterson capta a essncia da obra de Massanet, no se acomoda, moderniza a leitura. Transporta a obra para a Paris dos anos 50, trem chegando com Manon, festas aos ps da Torre Eifel e a graa do Hotel Transilvania so elementos dinmicos . Explora o potencial dramtico dos cantores, movimenta-os sem exageros. A luz perfeita, ajuda e estimula, diretores dessa vez se entenderam, tiveram a mesma concepo. Figurinos condizentes com a poca escolhida, impecveis, perfeitos no acabamento, nos transportam a cidade luz da dcada de 50. Essa pera inaugura um novo quesito, maquiagem, nunca vi trabalho to bem executado. Coristas ou protagonistas esto impecavelmente maquiados, com o advento da alta definio a maquiagem deu um salto qualitativo.

  Comparando a primeira Manon que assisti com Edita Gruberova datada do ano de 1983 em Viena com a recm lanada da Netrebko, existe uma evoluo, como as gravaes de pera mudaram nesses 25 anos. A pera  mais teatro que canto, do VHS estamos no DVD de alta definio, as produes so infinitamente mais caprichadas, lembram grandes peas de teatro ou produes da Brodway. Temos entrevistas com os protagonistas e diretores, escolha de captulos e um encarte com artigo e resumo da pera, tudo em ingls  claro.

  Vocalmente prefiro a Manon com a Gruberova ou com Beverly Sills em 1977 na New York City Opera. A Manon da Netrebko e do Villazon trs uma nova linguagem , moderna, atual, carismtica. Na era da internet, da msica digital, da velocidade, do consumo descartvel, pera parece uma aberrao. Mas ela encontra um caminho, renova o pblico e como Fnix sempre renasce.

3098833,5,B0012UQIW6,"Excellent performance from both, Villazn and Netrebko, definitely there's an outstanding chemistry between them tnat enchantes the audiences.  Highly recommended version.",1231459200,4,170,7.095238095238095
3098834,3,B0012UQIW6,"This production is a beautiful show to watch. The cast is exciting, but so little French. So, if you do not pay too much attention to the pronunciation, then you will enjoy the creamy and lyric voice of Ms Netrebko, who portrays a strong Manon, dedicated to pleasure (see L'hotel de Transylvanie act). Villazon is, as always, very  (some would say too much) involved in his character, but his voice was, at that time (2006),  still responding (though he is asking too much). However, Faisons un reve is sung with beautiful pianissimi. Barenboim is not to be mentionnned as the sound of the orchestra is international and not Massenet.
Generally speaking, a overall good production, but French is not the best quality of Ms Netrebko.",1227052800,13,732,4.848
3098835,5,B0012UQIW6,"For some time I have tried to resist the charms of Netrebko; I listened to her Gilda from the Met; well sung but something was lacking. When Virgin released the L'Elisire from Vienna with Villazon and Netrebko I got it principally for Villazon who didn't disappoint. The diva was charming but she faced stiff competition in this arena: Scotto, Gheorghiu, etc. Considering Nucci's age it was an amazing performance but at least it was in a repertoire that he should never have strayed from.

But back to Manon. I had already purchased the Virgin DVD and loved it although there were deficiencies but this is not the place to discuss them. For conservative opera goers this Berlin production is probably not the version to buy. As everyone knows the action as has been moved up to 1950 or there abouts. For me this works even though Massenet clearly evokes a France of the 18th century in much of the music. And Anna? she is a charmer entering fully into the the directors concept. She pounts, she flirts, she charms, she lies and she loves all with passion and commitment. Oh yes, she sings well. Is it a French Manon? Well, hardly, but she does make the attempt--a language coach is credited. There is only one Frenchman in the cast, but a stylistic French Manon in the 21st century is unlikely. One wonders when was the last time a Massenet opera was performed in Berlin, and to have Barenboim at the helm. This is hardly his fach, if one can borrow a singer's term. It is amazing to see and hear this great conductor who has spent his life with Mozart, Beethoven and Wagner conducting what many consider a frivolous entertainment. The notes indicate that he took over some ten days before the performance was to debut; he learned the score in that time; surely a rest from the rigors of his usual repertoire and a bravo for not patronizing the music.

For me it would be impossible to choose Berlin over Barcelon or vice versa; I am glad I have both. I prefer either one to the Fleming version even though it was produced at the Bastille. Renee is weak in the first two acts--Dessay it probably the only Manon who can claim to be 15 and not look like a liar. And even though I have not seen it, the Vienna production has no allure for me. I may be accused of being sexist here, but Gruberova has little on not sex appeal for me and the voice is insufficiently glamorous.",1225065600,11,2372,4.488425925925926
3098836,5,B0012UQIW6,"Here is the second major production of Jules Massenet's ""Manon"" to come out on DVD in 2008. Earlier, we had David McVicar's gritty, unsentimental production, set in the story's own period of the early 18th century, from Barcelona's Liceu Opera House. Now comes a much ""prettier"" production, updated to the 1950s in a glamorous Hollywood treatment by Vincent Patterson for Los Angeles Opera and the Berlin Staatsoper. These DVDs are as different as their two female stars -- Natalie Dessay and Anna Netrebko -- though interestingly they share the same male star, tenor Rolando Villazn. And if you love this opera, or French opera in general, you probably should get them both.

Though I think that McVicar's version presents the story much more powerfully than does Patterson's somewhat superficial interpretation, this newest version is a pleasure to watch, full of gorgeous costumes and eye candy galore. Patterson makes Manon into a Hollywood-obsessed Material Girl, who lives her life as her own film, channeling by turns Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, and in her death scene, Ingrid Bergman. The glamorous Anna Netrebko carries off all these transformations with exuberance and a spectacular star wardrobe. Yet, though most of the story seems operetta-light in this production, Netrebko does manage to induce tears in her final death scene, aided in no small measure by Villazn's heartfelt performance. And her rich-voiced singing is generally gorgeous, save for the occasional shrill top note or slightly messy coloratura run. While she is not the subtle actress Dessay is, she is fully convincing as a woman men would all but kill to possess.

Villazn manages to create almost a different character in his portrayal of her lover Des Grieux in comparison to his performance with Dessay. He seems here to be much younger, more playful and more completely dominated by Manon. His singing is impassioned and exciting, but sometimes sounds under stress. Not so his singing of the famous aria ""La Rve,"" which floats with great sweetness and touching sincerity.

The rest of the cast is uniformly strong, especially Alfredo Daza as a firm-voiced Lescaut, Manon's cousin, played as a much less sinister, more good-hearted character here than in McVicar's production. And bass Christof Fischesser is an outstanding Count Des Grieux with a sonorous voice and authorative acting presence -- far superior to Samuel Ramey in the Liceu DVD. Daniel Barenboim, though not the last word as a French stylist, directs the Staatskapelle Berlin ably.

If you wonder what all the ""Dream Couple"" fuss is about or are already a Netrebko-Villazn fan, you owe it to yourself to get this DVD. The sizzling, sexy connection between this pair is truly something special in the world of opera. It's not hype, it's not marketing: this couple has chemistry and charisma squared if not cubed! The Saint Sulpice scene here is hair-raisingly intense as Manon stalks the would-be-priest Des Grieux, who is like a caged animal behind the sacristy gates.

While I admire the Liceu production more, I can't resist this charmer.",1224633600,22,3113,5.1686507936507935
3098837,5,B0012UQIW6,"This Manon is terrific in every way. Nicely staged, with color and action, despite simple sets. Well sung all around. Netrebko steals the show with her incredibly glamorous beauty and superb singing. The days of the fat soprano are farther and farther behind us. Only when opera is a great show on top of the inspired music, superb singing, and exciting spectacle, will it fascinate the great potential audience out there.

This DVD is a fine step in that direction.",1224460800,5,466,4.825
3098838,4,B0012UQIW6,"Netrebko y Villazon son maravillosos, pero la version de Gruberova-Araiza es tambien hermosa, no se la pierdan.",1224460800,2,111,5.588235294117647
3098839,3,B0012UQIW6,"I have been waiting many months for this DVD. Maybe I expected too much but there is no one better than Renee Fleming's Manon at the Paris Opera (really a Masterclass). Her singing (perfect technique) and acting are much much better than Netrebko's. Netrebko makes a cinical and cabaret type Manon and that is not the way that this role should be acted and sung. Her acting is cold and exaggerated. Fleming sings and acts a more human, sweet and sincere Manon and her voice is more adequate for this role than Netrebko's. Anna Netrebko is singins many roles and seems that for her is no difference between them, she does not capture the spirit of each role. In Fleming's DVD is missing Rolando Villazn, a convincing and passionate Des Grieux singing and acting. He is really spectacular in this role as in many others. Visually Paris' Manon is really beautiful. On the contrary this DVD's stage design is colorful but not attractive at all.
My perfect Manon would be Fleming-Villazn. If you want a good Manon, buy Flewming's.",1223596800,13,1025,4.731843575418995

De menina ingnua a caminho do convento para a consagrao em Paris (Faz uma emergente inesquecvel)  e a decadncia na priso. Tudo demonstrado com muita convico atravs de uma atuao soberba. Isso  uma cantora moderna, isso  pera do sculo XXI, uma unio de elementos da arte. Isso renova e atrai publico.

  O tenor mexicano Rolando Villazn segue o mesmo padro de qualidade, seu Le Chevaliers Des Grieux  evolui de jovem, ingnuo e cheio de amor para um homem maduro e amargurado. Sua voz tenta acompanhar a evoluo do personagem, nas passagens lricas se sai muito bem, nas partes dramticas falta peso. Atua bem ao lado da protagonista, incorpora o personagem, est a vontade no papel, melhor que na verso anterior com Natalie Dessay em Paris , 2007.

  Os comprimrios de destaque so: Christof Fischesser faz Le Comte des Grieux , papel para baixo de voz encorpada. Ele  jovem demais, pouco lembra o pai do protagonista e sua voz est mais para bartono que para baixo. O Lescaut de Afredo Dasa  bartono de voz clara com boa musicalidade e atuao.

  Daniel Baremboin  um badalado pianista e maestro de renome mundial, rege orquestras pelos quatro cantos do mundo. Sempre achei ele melhor no piano. Na batuta da Staatskapelle Berlim seus tempos so excessivamente lentos, talvez seja para ajudar os cantores a interpretarem, seno haja flego! Mas isso torna a leitura da obra montona, as vezes cansativa, rias que empolgam o publico so pouco ovacionadas. Perde a msica, ganha o teatro.

  A direo de Vincent Paterson capta a essncia da obra de Massanet, no se acomoda, moderniza a leitura. Transporta a obra para a Paris dos anos 50, trem chegando com Manon, festas aos ps da Torre Eifel e a graa do Hotel Transilvania so elementos dinmicos . Explora o potencial dramtico dos cantores, movimenta-os sem exageros. A luz perfeita, ajuda e estimula, diretores dessa vez se entenderam, tiveram a mesma concepo. Figurinos condizentes com a poca escolhida, impecveis, perfeitos no acabamento, nos transportam a cidade luz da dcada de 50. Essa pera inaugura um novo quesito, maquiagem, nunca vi trabalho to bem executado. Coristas ou protagonistas esto impecavelmente maquiados, com o advento da alta definio a maquiagem deu um salto qualitativo.

  Comparando a primeira Manon que assisti com Edita Gruberova datada do ano de 1983 em Viena com a recm lanada da Netrebko, existe uma evoluo, como as gravaes de pera mudaram nesses 25 anos. A pera  mais teatro que canto, do VHS estamos no DVD de alta definio, as produes so infinitamente mais caprichadas, lembram grandes peas de teatro ou produes da Brodway. Temos entrevistas com os protagonistas e diretores, escolha de captulos e um encarte com artigo e resumo da pera, tudo em ingls  claro.

  Vocalmente prefiro a Manon com a Gruberova ou com Beverly Sills em 1977 na New York City Opera. A Manon da Netrebko e do Villazon trs uma nova linguagem , moderna, atual, carismtica. Na era da internet, da msica digital, da velocidade, do consumo descartvel, pera parece uma aberrao. Mas ela encontra um caminho, renova o pblico e como Fnix sempre renasce.

3333331,3,B0012UQIW6,"This production is a beautiful show to watch. The cast is exciting, but so little French. So, if you do not pay too much attention to the pronunciation, then you will enjoy the creamy and lyric voice of Ms Netrebko, who portrays a strong Manon, dedicated to pleasure (see L'hotel de Transylvanie act). Villazon is, as always, very  (some would say too much) involved in his character, but his voice was, at that time (2006),  still responding (though he is asking too much). However, Faisons un reve is sung with beautiful pianissimi. Barenboim is not to be mentionnned as the sound of the orchestra is international and not Massenet.
Generally speaking, a overall good production, but French is not the best quality of Ms Netrebko.",1227052800,13,732,4.848
3333332,5,B0012UQIW6,"For some time I have tried to resist the charms of Netrebko; I listened to her Gilda from the Met; well sung but something was lacking. When Virgin released the L'Elisire from Vienna with Villazon and Netrebko I got it principally for Villazon who didn't disappoint. The diva was charming but she faced stiff competition in this arena: Scotto, Gheorghiu, etc. Considering Nucci's age it was an amazing performance but at least it was in a repertoire that he should never have strayed from.

But back to Manon. I had already purchased the Virgin DVD and loved it although there were deficiencies but this is not the place to discuss them. For conservative opera goers this Berlin production is probably not the version to buy. As everyone knows the action as has been moved up to 1950 or there abouts. For me this works even though Massenet clearly evokes a France of the 18th century in much of the music. And Anna? she is a charmer entering fully into the the directors concept. She pounts, she flirts, she charms, she lies and she loves all with passion and commitment. Oh yes, she sings well. Is it a French Manon? Well, hardly, but she does make the attempt--a language coach is credited. There is only one Frenchman in the cast, but a stylistic French Manon in the 21st century is unlikely. One wonders when was the last time a Massenet opera was performed in Berlin, and to have Barenboim at the helm. This is hardly his fach, if one can borrow a singer's term. It is amazing to see and hear this great conductor who has spent his life with Mozart, Beethoven and Wagner conducting what many consider a frivolous entertainment. The notes indicate that he took over some ten days before the performance was to debut; he learned the score in that time; surely a rest from the rigors of his usual repertoire and a bravo for not patronizing the music.

For me it would be impossible to choose Berlin over Barcelon or vice versa; I am glad I have both. I prefer either one to the Fleming version even though it was produced at the Bastille. Renee is weak in the first two acts--Dessay it probably the only Manon who can claim to be 15 and not look like a liar. And even though I have not seen it, the Vienna production has no allure for me. I may be accused of being sexist here, but Gruberova has little on not sex appeal for me and the voice is insufficiently glamorous.",1225065600,11,2372,4.488425925925926
3333333,5,B0012UQIW6,"Here is the second major production of Jules Massenet's ""Manon"" to come out on DVD in 2008. Earlier, we had David McVicar's gritty, unsentimental production, set in the story's own period of the early 18th century, from Barcelona's Liceu Opera House. Now comes a much ""prettier"" production, updated to the 1950s in a glamorous Hollywood treatment by Vincent Patterson for Los Angeles Opera and the Berlin Staatsoper. These DVDs are as different as their two female stars -- Natalie Dessay and Anna Netrebko -- though interestingly they share the same male star, tenor Rolando Villazn. And if you love this opera, or French opera in general, you probably should get them both.

Though I think that McVicar's version presents the story much more powerfully than does Patterson's somewhat superficial interpretation, this newest version is a pleasure to watch, full of gorgeous costumes and eye candy galore. Patterson makes Manon into a Hollywood-obsessed Material Girl, who lives her life as her own film, channeling by turns Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, and in her death scene, Ingrid Bergman. The glamorous Anna Netrebko carries off all these transformations with exuberance and a spectacular star wardrobe. Yet, though most of the story seems operetta-light in this production, Netrebko does manage to induce tears in her final death scene, aided in no small measure by Villazn's heartfelt performance. And her rich-voiced singing is generally gorgeous, save for the occasional shrill top note or slightly messy coloratura run. While she is not the subtle actress Dessay is, she is fully convincing as a woman men would all but kill to possess.

Villazn manages to create almost a different character in his portrayal of her lover Des Grieux in comparison to his performance with Dessay. He seems here to be much younger, more playful and more completely dominated by Manon. His singing is impassioned and exciting, but sometimes sounds under stress. Not so his singing of the famous aria ""La Rve,"" which floats with great sweetness and touching sincerity.

The rest of the cast is uniformly strong, especially Alfredo Daza as a firm-voiced Lescaut, Manon's cousin, played as a much less sinister, more good-hearted character here than in McVicar's production. And bass Christof Fischesser is an outstanding Count Des Grieux with a sonorous voice and authorative acting presence -- far superior to Samuel Ramey in the Liceu DVD. Daniel Barenboim, though not the last word as a French stylist, directs the Staatskapelle Berlin ably.

If you wonder what all the ""Dream Couple"" fuss is about or are already a Netrebko-Villazn fan, you owe it to yourself to get this DVD. The sizzling, sexy connection between this pair is truly something special in the world of opera. It's not hype, it's not marketing: this couple has chemistry and charisma squared if not cubed! The Saint Sulpice scene here is hair-raisingly intense as Manon stalks the would-be-priest Des Grieux, who is like a caged animal behind the sacristy gates.

While I admire the Liceu production more, I can't resist this charmer.",1224633600,22,3113,5.1686507936507935
3333334,5,B0012UQIW6,"This Manon is terrific in every way. Nicely staged, with color and action, despite simple sets. Well sung all around. Netrebko steals the show with her incredibly glamorous beauty and superb singing. The days of the fat soprano are farther and farther behind us. Only when opera is a great show on top of the inspired music, superb singing, and exciting spectacle, will it fascinate the great potential audience out there.

This DVD is a fine step in that direction.",1224460800,5,466,4.825

3333336,3,B0012UQIW6,"I have been waiting many months for this DVD. Maybe I expected too much but there is no one better than Renee Fleming's Manon at the Paris Opera (really a Masterclass). Her singing (perfect technique) and acting are much much better than Netrebko's. Netrebko makes a cinical and cabaret type Manon and that is not the way that this role should be acted and sung. Her acting is cold and exaggerated. Fleming sings and acts a more human, sweet and sincere Manon and her voice is more adequate for this role than Netrebko's. Anna Netrebko is singins many roles and seems that for her is no difference between them, she does not capture the spirit of each role. In Fleming's DVD is missing Rolando Villazn, a convincing and passionate Des Grieux singing and acting. He is really spectacular in this role as in many others. Visually Paris' Manon is really beautiful. On the contrary this DVD's stage design is colorful but not attractive at all.
My perfect Manon would be Fleming-Villazn. If you want a good Manon, buy Flewming's.",1223596800,13,1025,4.731843575418995
8247854,5,B0012UQIW6,"Another sexy performance with Netrebko and Villazon.  They again, as in the Traviata, perform in their underwear in their domestic scene.  Netrebko has only her abbreviated panties and brazier as they have a pillow fight.  Manon has some dead wood in it; those two friends and some of  the cousin's music is less than great as well as the Cours de la Reine scene.  Netrebko sings magnificently throughout.  Villazon seems to be stretching his basically lyric voice in the dramatic moments.  I was stunned at how Manon's hair was shaved off before her deportation.  It was a good idea.  The sets were particularly attractive and the gambling well played.",1485907200,,653,4.91743119266055

8247856,5,B0012UQIW6,"Anna Netebko is a seductive Manon bringing out all her tragic flaws.  The production is fantastic and one can imagine how controversial the cohabitation scene was in Massenet's time.  The score is sumptuous and  Rolando Villazon is drawn into it as we are.  Augustine's lustful heart was changed by this verse: ""not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying"" (Ro 13:13).  This is the hard lesson learned by Manon.  But is she a heroine?  She grasps for fame and worldly pleasures with an inconsistent care for the consequences.  Manon captures lust, greed, physical seductive beauty and loss of innocence.  Her despair, however, is self-centered when she realizes that her life is empty.  But it is too late for true love - she only exchanges passions and in this respect she is an anti-heroine, embracing all that is vanity and destroying those around her until she is destroyed by one worse than her.  The portrayal of Manon as famed Hollywood stars from the past is very clever but unnecessary.  The blonde Marilyn Monroe was a bit over the top.  The opera does not need it as her character is truly self-explanatory and transcends these other figures from our recent pop culture.  Poor  Villazon plays the true hero - the one who loves and gives himself to Manon even to her lusts.  His singing is full of passion and conflict in his soul.  But Manon realizes this too late, dying, being exiled and ill, does she truly come to understand true love or is it only by default - the only thing she can even grasp at?  The answer to this question determines if this Manon is a heroine or just another lost soul who made a little splash in society.",1417392000,,1692,4.658783783783784
8247857,5,B0012UQIW6,This is a long time purchase (more than a year ago) but I can say this was a good service and i had no problem with the product.,1391644800,,128,3.607142857142857
8247858,5,B0012UQIW6,"I come very late to the reviewing process for this disc for 2 reasons: first, I waited for the price to drop, and, second, I was so viscerally put off by the cover photo that I consigned it to the opera shelves unwatched. My bad!

Now, gentle reader, I am pretty much a traditionalist as far as staging is concerned, with the operative phrase being ""pretty much"". Rigoletto in Vegas as per the latest Met DVD leaves me cold. That is why the cover photo turned me off so much. But this performance captures the soul of Manon, even though the time in which the opera is set is changed.

Anna Netrebko is a controversial soprano (but most successful ones are) to many, but not to me. I first saw her in the Baden Baden gala, which is still available on DVD, and ... ma foi! I find her to be a stunning performer in virtually everything I have seen. Whether it is Elisir, Don Pasquale, Anna Bolena or La Boheme, she delivers fully committed and convincing realizations of her character(s).

Here, she is one of only two singers known to me who can, at 40+, appear to be 15 (the other is Natalie Dessay, who recently announced her retirement form opera). And she captures Manon's decline splendidly. Vocally, too, she is everything I would want in a Manon, throughout the range, from forte to pianissimo.

Villazon is, in my opinion, better here than he is in the performance with Dessay, although I will not part with that disc, gentle reader! Particularly in the demanding St. Sulpice scene and specifiacally with the aria ""Ah! fuyez, douce image"", there is no sign of the strain that was apparent in the Dessay version. Acting? Well, Villazon certainly delivers the goods. I have generally found him to be a bit manic onstage, which is a plus to me, since I have evolved away from the ""park & bark"" singing that was the norm when I first got into opera.

The rest of the cast is of the same mold: all do well both dramatically and vocally,

I was most pleasantly surprised by the conducting of Daniel Barenboim: I simply had never associated him with with opera in general or romantic French opera in specific.

Picture and sound are what I expect from DGG, with the DTS setting producing a fantastic ambience. There is a very good ""making of Manon"" extra that I found most interesting.

Too many opera fans are a bit tied to the past, with me being one of them. I am glad that I broke out of that mindset for this disc. But I am not so far gone so as to consider that awful Met Rigoletto set in Las Vegas. Nosiree!",1371600000,3,2513,4.424242424242424
8247859,1,B0012UQIW6,"If you are new to French opera and if you don't speak any French and if you don't mind directors taking artistic liberties that subvert the composer's intentions, then this dvd is for you. If what attracts you to this recording is Villazon, you are better off purchasing his other recording of Manon in the company of the French-native Natalie Dessay. I think it was a strategic mistake for Anna to attack the French repertoire in general (her French is worse than her Italian, and her Italian is atrocious...you get the idea) and this opera in particular (given that it is difficult to improve on the recent award-winning CD recording of this opera by Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna; all other productions are dwarfed by the astonishing Gheorghiu-Alagna one; but unfortunately we have only their cd; there's no dvd!).

I am always amazed at the nonchalance with which directors, producers, and singers approach French opera...Very few seem to get that there is a distinct style at work, which requires distinct artistic choices...Massenet is not a French version of Puccini!",1356307200,5,1080,5.033519553072626
8247860,5,B0012UQIW6,"Like the Donizetti Love Potion, this also teams up Villazon and Netrebko to completely believable effect. Both are in good voice although there are a few early signs of the vocal strain which has recently caused Villazon problems leading to unreliable engagements. These are not of any real significance here though and should not affect any purchasing choice. The problem may stem from his apparent reluctance to hold back his enthusiasm to deliver fully in performance rather than saving his voice whenever possible. This is good for his audiences but is a potentially heavy long term price for Villazon. He certainly gives 100% here.

The setting is updated to the 1950's, but both Villazon and Netrebko have an aura about them that suggests a modern coupling would be appropriate. They are especially vibrant together and are clearly of an appropriate age for each other dramatically. This is a great advantage in any opera but is especially beneficial in this setting. Netrebko brings a dramatic aura of both glamour and decadence to her part and is in particularly good voice. The part seems made for her.

All the supporting roles are well sung and convincingly portrayed by Christof Fischesser, Alfredo Daza, Remy Corazza, Arttu Kataja, Hanan Alattar, Gal James, Silvia de la Muela and Mattias Vieweg although inevitably the limelight is dominated by Anna Netrebko and to a lesser extent, by Rolando Villazon.

The orchestra is also on top form under the sparkling direction of Barenboim.

The recording offers excellent surround sound in DTS 5.1, PCM 5.1 as well as stereo. The camera work is sympathetic with a nice balance of close detail and more distant shots. As another reviewer has remarked, it is vital that good singing is backed up by good acting in opera especially when the storyline is so slight and we are certainly offered a combination of fine singing and acting in this case. Fortunately we live in an age when the old stand and deliver approach has been replaced by far better stage training and camera awareness and that is what we get here.

In general terms, although I personally like the modern setting, I feel that there will be those who would prefer a more traditional staging and it should be noted that this production may not therefore be to everyone's personal taste. The musical values remain excellent however whatever views one may have on production choices and this performance certainly went down well with the audience. Providing that purchasers are prepared to accept the period updating to the 1950's this disc should give considerable pleasure. With that proviso in mind, it seems reasonable to suggest that 5 stars is a fair rating for those in sympathy with this modernised concept and that those who would reject that should look elsewhere for their choice of Manon.",1343260800,2,2818,4.974522292993631
8247861,3,B0012UQIW6,"Netrebko delights in showing us her waning 20 ans. Her singing is sometimes nerve wracking - constantly changing registers. Villazon is steady and lofty in voice, and honest in acting.  Interesting production but not too interesting.",1293580800,,233,5.472222222222222
