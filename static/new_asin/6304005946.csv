758456,5,6304005946,"This is a film which will haunt you long after you see it. Several desperate soldiers are trapped in a desert 'glasshouse' guarded by sadistic guards who force the prisoners to charge repeatedly up a dune carrying sandbags until exhaustion overcomes them (a la Sisyphus). The film follows the inmates attempts for justice - either through violence or their own sense of innocence.
Easily one of my favourite B&W films: the acting is 'heroic', the B&W cinematography unsurpassed and the plot is tragic and intense.  Connery's greatest film.",971827200,7,539,5.125
758457,5,6304005946,"This is one of the most powerfully-acted films you're likely to see, again proving the traditionally underrated Sean Connery one of the finest actors of his generation.  Connery's cynical but heroic prisoner role is matched  by character actor Harry Andrews as an old-school sergeant major running a  sun-baked British military prison in WWII North Africa.  Other Amazon  reviewers outline the plot, so I'll just note that Sidney Lumet's direction  and unique jump-cut editing style makes this an unforgettable drama.

758577,5,6304005946,"A superb, gritty look at the brutal treatment of British soldiers in a WW 2 British prison camp.  The prisoners have been convicted of various crimes and are sent to a prison camp in the middle east to correct their errant ways.  Sean Connery is great in this role of a sargent major convicted of beating up an officer, who is compelled to change the conditions of the prisoners after one of his prison cell mates dies from the heat and extreme stress of the brutal treatment meted out by a vicious guard.  Not a dull moment in this gripping drama.",1472083200,,548,4.405940594059406
758578,5,6304005946,"This is a Sean Connery movie that is often overlooked, given that it appeared during the heyday of his career as Mr. Bond. It is, however, a real gem of a film - a tour de force of brilliant performances that will have you on the edge of your seat. Connery plays the role of a hard bitten Sergeant Major who is sent to a British Army military prison in North Africa, for assaulting an officer, during World War II. His realisation that the prison is run by a sadistic NCO (Ian Hendry) and a Sergeant Major who is an old school stickler for the King's Regulations (Harry Andrews),  provides an electric tension of incredulity and leads to a climax of defiance. Great performances are in evidence by all, with some comic relief by Roy Kinnear and a studied performance by Michael Redgrave as the ineffectual Medical Officer. Other appearances by Ossie Davis and Ian Bannen, as well as exquisite direction by the great Sidney Lumet, make this film one powerful package - one not to miss.",1470355200,2,984,4.559322033898305

758585,5,6304005946,"Some may think that old war movies can not be compared with the modern ones because of the lack of super high-tech effects and millions of dollars which current productions have in ambudance. Although it is true that no old movie can give you the terrific visual effects of ""Saving Private Ryan"" they do have some advantages, especially when the theme is about World War II. First of all, they were closer to the real time of the war, thus the heroes, the faces, the mentality, the materials, the surroundings and even the language are much more realistic than any modern director could ever hope for. ""The Hill"" belongs to this category of excellent old British war films, picturing the behind-the-scenes drama of the 8th Armys penal battalions in Egypt and the Western Desert in 1942, through the story of five new convicts who arrive in such a camp in order to become soldiers again. The brutality of the NCOs is finely depicted, and the hill that torments scores of inmates is ever present. One the finest scene is that of the attempted mutiny inside the camp, and the way the tough commandant suppress it using excellently intimidation, authority, threats and cajole. The story takes many unexpected turns exposing the racist behavior of the old British Empire, the rotten apples inside the Army basket, and the mind games that the commandant played even on his superiors!

It's a story about British Empire military misfits who are sent to a punishment camp for retraining. The hill is a constructed of sand and dirt and used as a displinary tool throughout the film when inmates are made to climb up, then down again and again where only the strongest survive from heat exhaustion. It's especially cruel when they are made to do this in full packs wearing a oxygen mask. The guards are superb where most go too far with of course the one guard who thinks his fellow mates go too far in their duties.

758835,5,6304005946,"As good and valid as when I first saw it 45 years ago.

There are as many ways to interpret the film's messages as there are viewers. This is my view.

It contrasts the prison staff, the good, the bad and the ugly (or psychopathic) within the military mores of the period - and for long afterward - with what we may now believe is reasonable.
But we must remember that this is wartime, we were close to losing in N Africa - distractions by cowards, thieves and deserters must be removed.
Always, in the British Army, WO's and SNCO's have to balance between Power and Authority. Most succeed, a few do not.

The cell of prisoners are a contrasting mixture, a petty thief, a brazen hard man, a sentimental lover,  a naive black, a manipulative SNCO who had fought ineffectually for his subordinates battle survival - they died and he survived, he could be seen as having picked a clever way to save himself.

At the end his 'clever plan' to defeat the prison staff ineffectual and failed at the moment when he thought it was in his grasp.",1359158400,2,1036,4.431578947368421
758836,2,6304005946,"I watched 30 minutes of it, and then turned it off. It was difficult to understand the British accents, so it was hard to understand what they were saying. Watching a movie with 30% to 50% of unintelligible dialogue is not worth it.

This movie is about a British prison camp for British soldiers who disobeyed orders; the prisoners run up/down a mound of sand in the hot sun, and get yelled at (verbally abused) by other Brits...like a bad version of boot camp. There is not a German, Italian, or Japanese in sight.

Definitely watch the trailer or rent it before you consider buying it.

So is this the original, significant film, portraying sadistic abuse within the military, and/or prison, stand up to tyranny etc.... I don't know. But I will say it has the feel of original inspiration. The performances are powerful, bordering on over the top, but intriguing. This film gets better as it goes leading to a surprising and abrupt climax. There is a feeling of oppression and desperation which has a rather unusual mood and effect in my experience.

A masterful film about a British military prison in World War II dominated by a massive artificial hill in the desert that the inmates are forced to run up and down over and over, The Hill occasionally covers familiar ground (the non-conformist, the brutal power-hungry establishment) but does it in such a original and striking way that the movie is never less than fascinating and ends as something close to great.

758843,5,6304005946,"... is ""tour de force"", and that's exactly what we have, all around, in this film.
I was very young when I first saw this movie, hacked as it was by TV censors, but not too badly, since it was playing on CBS' early forays into Late Night broadcasting in the mid-1970's.
I had recently seen ""Cool Hand Luke"", and read Donn Pearce's novel, and to say this movie is nearly identical in concept is to damn it with faint praise. As with the American story set in a Florida prison, ""The Hill""'s location in the middle of some godforsaken British desert colony makes the omnipresent heat a major character in the driving of the plot; the sun is simultaneously distant and omnipresent, and just as merciless as Morgan Woodward's ""Man With No Eyes"" in ""Cool Hand Luke"". You can crack a sweat just watching the prisoners humping up and down that damned hill in full battle kit under the desert sun.
Anyone could go crazy after enough time in the stockade of ""The Hill"", and pretty much every one of the camp guards and administrators already have, one way or another. Throwing prisoners into this place is guaranteed to produce results of some sort, and there is absolutely no confusion about whether such an institution's purpose is to provide ""rehabilitation"" as opposed to ""punishment"". If anyone survives their sentence to be released, it's a safe bet they will not return, even if it means being shot for desertion.
Every performance in this film is, in a word, flawless. Even cliched plot elements pass by with seamless credibility, owing to the performances of cast members whose roles are so well portrayed, you forget you are watching some of the finest character actors in cinema.
It's great to finally be able to see this movie again; it holds up beautifully, as the issues it addresses are timeless. ""The Hill"" could have been set against the backdrop of the Roman Legions, and would be no less compelling.

758900,5,6304005946,"'The Hill' is a thirsty drama set at a prison-camp for allied troops in WW2 North Africa.
It's where all the dregs end up: the tea-leafs, the insubordinates, the shell-shocked, the AWOLs, the scared...
There are no punishment blocks, no floggings, no forced square-bashing - what they have is The Hill; a peak of sand and rocks which the naughty boys have to run up and down in the blazing heat wearing full pack.
Until they drop.

Run by a belligerent RSM, his sycophantic lackeys and a weak medical officer acting as C.O, the camp is no place for anybody except the wired and the fierce.
Punishment is arbitrary, unjust and relentless; blind obedience and discipline the only escape.

So the status quo gets jolly excited when Sgt. Joe Roberts turns up as part of an influx of prisoners. Roberts violently disagreed with an officer trying to give him orders; The Hill was custom-made for him.

His co-arrivals are a pathetic bunch: the bully, the fat-boy, the whimpering 'family man,' the ethnic, the humanitarian..
All have their weaknesses detected, rounded on, and callously exploited. Each tiny chink in the armour is ruthlessly prised open to form gaping, damaging psychological lesions..
The bully is given loyalty conundrums, the fat-boy strenuous assault-course exercise, the effeminate family man is run up and down The Hill until he drops....dead.
The only constant, apparent within the abused and the beleaguered, is that they're all linked to The Hill.
Who breaks? In war, no-one can win...?

'The Hill' is a horror movie; one of the most pure, desperate and challenging it's possible to imagine. It features bogey-men, sadism, conspiracy, despair, death, abandonment - and most horrifically - a graphic portrayal of the most evil act of all: the organisational transformation of free-thinking individuals into drones by an almost Biblically 'old order' military philosophy, choking on its own antiquated history.

It's superbly cast, brilliantly shot in b/w, and there's no music score; the main title is simply a bleak Ariel Narrow imposed over trudging, weary
marching-steps, barked orders and the clanging of gates.
Do not, under any circumstances, miss 'The Hill'.",1247875200,3,2183,5.155367231638418

Became hooked from that point on.  One of director Lumet's best, and in my opinion not given it's full due. Finally lucky to have found it on DVD through Amazon.

758905,5,6304005946,"Sidney Lumet is best known for his classic ""12 Angry Men"", with Henry Fonda. I have been trying for almost twenty years to get hold of this prisoner camp/WWII movie after hearing great recommendations from trustworthy friends. Finally I can say that this one is even better. In my opinion it is simply one of the best 100 film of all times. Why it hasn't been on dvd till now is beyond me.

Shot in beautiful and stark black and white in the desert of Almera (Spain). During WWII in north Africa the British run this prison camp for British petty criminals whose lives are made miserable to the brink of going mad. One cell is shared by five very different persons, each one very interesting for the type they represent. Harry Andrews plays the cruel sergeant-Major who sadically enjoys torturing his ""human specimens"" march up and down a man-made sand hill. His staff-sergeant embodies the loathable lackey who takes orders and even exceeds in carrying them out. All the cast is superb, wonderful. Connery, the star in the film is very good but I felt the other characters were as interesting -if not more- than him. The tension in the film increases by the minute, to a point when you can't even blink an eye, it's gripping, absorbing. One really feels like being there, tortured in the 100 degree sun, running out of breath, with no way to escape. The system is rotten but nobody dares speak out.

It is very realistic. It reminded me of my own Spanish military experience: the officer's cruelty, drunkenness, the commanders away with prostitutes and relaying responsibilities in the brutes of the lower ranks always willing to take it on the rank and file. Even the physical exhaustion, and the beating. The feeling of being isolated from the world, and that nobody outside will ever know what's going on inside. All of those emotions run vivid in this film. It's as close as it can get to living it.

One lesson out of this story is that every insitution is made up of human beings, and always the bad guys are going to end up ruling and corrupting the system if the system has no way of being checked; call it the Army or what have you.

A masterpiece.",1185148800,14,2158,4.582901554404145
758906,5,6304005946,"The Hill, undeservingly, has been a much underrated Sean Connery movie.  It was filmed in 1965, in black and white, and without any of the typical Hollywood special effects.  It relied solely on the intense acting and brutal plot.  British actor Harry Andrews, as Regimental Sgt. Maj. Bert Wilson was especially memorable.  Non Brits may have a hard time understanding the heavy accent if they do not turn on the subtitles which were not available in the VHS version.  I have been searching for ages for a DVD version of this movie and am delighted that it will be available this coming June.  A must have for all Sean Connery fans.",1174780800,6,632,4.648648648648648

Stars Sean Connery as one of the prisoners who is sent to the camp to improve his attitude. So-so film but can be interesting in places. It's a test of wills between prisoners and guards and the film shows what can happen to a soldier who bucks the system. Brutal guards who have the British Army on their side vs. prisoners who hate war, the army, and just want to go home.",1172966400,2,557,4.072727272727272
758908,5,6304005946,"I do not know, but it seems to me that this excellent movie must have been a stage play before being made into a movie.  The dialogue is relatively more important than in screenplays written as screenplays.  So it is good that the DVD provides English subtitles, because the British accents and shouted lines make it hard for Americans to understand what is said.

One customer review said that scenes had been deleted from the original movie, but I saw this movie in a movie theater when it came out in the 1960s, and I do not remember any scene not on this DVD.  Another customer wrote of some homosexual relationship in this movie, but I saw no clear indication of homosexuality except for a few sentences about a former prisoner, who has no role in this movie.  The drug abuse is limited to marijuana, but there is gross and apparently legal abuse of alcohol.

Altogether this is a very interesting movie, very well performed in general, except for only two scenes, when the screenplay tries to present psychological effects that are simply hard to present in a short space of time.  We are supposed to understand that the prisoners in cell 8 are cracking up, going bonkers; but this is presented rather awkwardly.",1154390400,2,1218,4.663551401869159
758909,5,6304005946,"In the impressive resume of illustrious director Sidney Lumet, his 1965 production of ""The Hill"" stands as one of his most underrated but fantastic accomplishments.  Using stark black and white cinematography and captivating camera angles the film shot in the desolate wastelands of Andalucia, Spain, depicts a gritty drama played out in a British WWII disciplinary camp.  Lumet inspired his cast into some remarkable acting performances.

Set in the steamy Libyan desert the camp is actually run by the regimented disciplinarian Sergeant Major Bert Wilson played superbly by actor Harry Andrews.  The camp's commandant is totally detatched from his command and the chief medical officer played by Michael Redgrave is merely going through the motions.

Andrews who rules with an iron fist, has received a group of five new prisoners.  Included in this group is court martialed Sergeant Major Trooper Joe Roberts played by Sean Connery, who was excellent in this role between appearances as 007.  Connery and his mates who include Ossie Davis as Pvt. Jacko King make inviting targets for newly added prison guard Staff Sgt. Williams played by Ian Hendry.  Hendry out to prove himself to his superior Andrews used ruthless and merciless tactics drilling his charges under the oppressive desert sun.

The centerpiece of the camp is a 60 foot high manmade hill over which the prisoners are marched until they drop from exhaustion.

Sgt. Williams singles out genteel prisoner Stevens played by Alfred Lynch marching him over the hill until he dies from heat exhaustion.  This throws the camp into upheaval as the prisoners threaten to rebel.

After Williams breaks the leg of Connery courtesy of a beating administered by 3 guards, a sympathetic guard Sgt. Charlie Harris played by Ian Bannen agrees to testify as to the mistreatment of the prisoners.  Medical officer Redgrave is convinced to file a report chronicling the brutality present at the camp.

""The Hill"" is a magnificent psychological drama pitting the wills of its characters on either side against each other.  The unbelieveable extent of the cruelty administered against soldiers fighting on the same side is convincingly represented by the splendid cast of characters led by a very talented director.",1149552000,4,2262,5.227146814404432
758931,5,6304005946,"'The Hill' is an astonishing movie in many respects.  It has a great ensemble cast, largely made of up of people who aren't generally part of ensemble acting - Sean Connery, Ossie Davis, and Michael Redgrave were certainly more of the 'leading man' types.  Other well-known actors from British cinema are featured as well (Roy Kinnear, Harry Andrews, Alfred Lynch, Ian Hendry, among others).  Sidney Lumet directed this film in 1965; based on a play, it shows the harsher side of masculine, military life - it is set in a disciplinary prison in the Libyan desert during World War II.

Connery and others star as a group of new prisoners getting acclimatised to the way life runs in the prison.  Some rebel, some go-along-to-get-along, some become introverted and depressed - the whole range of possibilities is explored.  There are class issues and racial issues addressed as well.

The title 'The Hill' comes from the artificial sand mountain constructed in the middle of the camp that the prison warder non-commissioned officers drill the prisoners on, breaking them down physically, and supposedly mentally, in order to reconstruct them as properly disciplined soldiers.  However, not everyone responds to this, and at a certain point in the film it becomes clear that one of the warders is in fact a quite sadistic guard.

The process goes on with drudging sameness until the disciplinary punishment goes too far, and a man dies from the treatment.  The subsequent attempt at a cover-up provides much of the drama for the film (even though this consists of less than half the screen time of the film), and the ending is certainly poetic in its justice even if it isn't a happy ending by any means.

The film was done at the height of Sean Connery's popularity as the new James Bond character - he had done three Bond films in the previous three years, including the classic 'Goldfinger' just the year before; here he was a gritty, working-class career soldier without the polish (or the toupee) of the Bond character.  Connery shows he is no lightweight actor here, nor does he use his star power to steal the show.

This film was also done in black-and-white, which shows the dusty, dry desert elements in greater relief than a full-colour or colourised version might.

I eagerly await the DVD.",1138147200,9,2299,4.861538461538461

I can't recall very many details about the film, but I remember liking it very much.

The inhuman treatment becomes this film a real status special and reveals how narrow can be the line between the authority excess and the macabre sadism.

Three memorable and realistic scenes will remain in your memory : Connery `s never ending  Hill `s ascent , the prisoners ` mutiny and the awful final .

758936,4,6304005946,"This is a splendid movie with fine acting.  The sets and camera angles are vivd and stark.  The fact that it was shot in b/w probably adds to the atmosphere as well.  Still, I can't help wondering if the so-called iron discipline the movie is trying to
critique is a little heavy-handed.  The film is deffinitely anti-war, without even being concerned directly with battlefield cowardice.  Still, I think the moral message here is a bit over done.  Yes, discipline can be excessive and has been used to abuse some in less fortunate circumstances, but I hope viewers don't come away from this film with the niave concept that all armies and all discipline is bad!  Armies are a reflection of the societies that form them.  The British army has a repuatation for toughness and stern discipline.  How has this repuatation been maintained through the centuries?  It is not so much the rock-hard discipline that keeps the soldier in line, but his regard and loyality for his regiment and comrades.  Therefore, the discipline becomes innate, as all wish to uphold the traditions and honors of their forefathers who likewise served in the same regiment 200 years ago.  Other armies, including the United States, would like to have such loyalty instilled in their troops, but the traditions and honors of centuries old regimental institutions are virtually unknown in the US army today.  I feel this movie tries to knock the very qualities that has made the British army the envy of many nations.  The excesses displayed here could happen in any army, not just the British one, and in many professions besides the military.  The viewer should take this into consideration with this otherwise stark, brutal, but fine film.",1044316800,10,1713,4.919860627177701

You will uncover few richer and more vulnerable Sean Connery performances on record.  But unlike most of Sean's star vehicles, this powderkeg menaces on all fronts.  One feels the tortuous heat of the punishing hill in the British prison, the strained nobility of seasoned soldiers treated with contempt by their captors, the unspoken psychological tremors beneath ""Williams'"" foreboding surface...

758938,5,6304005946,"One of the most intelligent and honest (not to mention beautifully filmed) movies I've seen in ages. Anyone depressed by Sean Connery's recent whorishness needs to look at this one. It's by far his greatest film.
""The Hill"" that gives the movie its name is a device of torture built by prisoners in the Libyan desert: a pyramid of stone, sand and corrugated iron, which looks like a vestige of some ancient, barbaric age. Prisoners who violate the letter or ""spirit"" of the British Army's antiquated rules are forced to hump double-time over the hill in full pack, in the searing mid-day sun, endlessly, until they drop. On its sides men are broken--hollowed out--and obedient robots are made.
""The Hill"" is, in my opinion, the most powerful WWII film ever made--yet not one bullet is fired in its two-plus hours. The drama and the terror of this film are in the war of character, of wills: the violence of psychological destruction. If this sounds boring to you, you should know that the film draws you in quickly with its stark premise (a disgraced NCO enters a detention camp for incorrigible soldiers, and antagonizes the sadistic staff-sergeant), then cuts deeper and deeper and does not flinch for an instant. This movie has a spine harder than the sun-blasted rock of ""the hill"" itself.
The maniacal inflexibility of leadership--particularly in wartime, and especially among noncombatants eager to prove their ""toughness""--has been the theme of several great movies. This may be the greatest. Its atmosphere is more convincing than other prison/boot-camp flicks (""Full Metal Jacket,"" ""Midnight Express,"" etc.), and its photography and editing have enormous impact--all without resort to stylization or even a musical score. The final brilliance is in the casting. It helps, of course, that most of the actors are unfamiliar to American viewers, but even the well-known ones inhabit their roles completely. Ossie Davis, for instance, is brilliant as a Caribbean prisoner who is forced to the conclusion that his white commanders are absurd and contemptible, unworthy of his obedience.

British character actor Harry Andrews (of the equine teeth and chin) does a vivid turn as the Sergeant-Major of the prison camp. He has to carry a lot of metaphorical baggage--all the sick, ossified Victorian sanctification of rules and ritualized manliness--on his lantern-jaw, yet he carries it off with surprising subtlety. (For instance: watch his face during the aborted prison riot, when the fear creeps into his smile as he realizes his junior officer may a psychopath).
Connery, the ""star"" of the ensemble, is a revelation. As the officer imprisoned for having defied a homicidally stupid order--and who still could not save his men--Connery adds a hint of survivor's guilt to the rage and perplexity simmering behind the resigned posture and sarcastic bluster. He's a hulk of a man, a field-hardened warrior, yet his lip trembles a bit as he steps out of rank--into the killing zone of the prison disciplinarians--to give evidence against an officer suspected in an inmate's death.
He has reason to be afraid. The officer he accuses, as played by Ian Hendry, is a meager, rail-thin fragment of a man, but what there is of him is iron-hard: a flesh and bone stiletto of cold savagery. Had a big man, like the ogreish Paul Smith of ""Midnight Express,"" been cast in the role, the conflict would have lost its dimensions and richness. It would have been reduced to a physical contest. Hendry's sergeant tells us all we need know about the misuse of authority, about the inadequate, half-mad creatures who can flourish within a rigid power-structure and use it to destroy far stronger, smarter, braver men. This sergeant's eyes hide in the shadow of his cap, and his voice and poise are almost feminine, but his chin is set and he knows the Structure's weaknesses and rules, chapter and verse. He exploits the Army's Victorian pieties (discipline, industry, clean-mindedness) to brutalize others, and in him those virtues become obscene.
Hendry despises the prisoner Stevens (who carries love letters from his wife) for his sentimentality, and for other, darker reasons, and he uses the Hill to exterminate him. Now we see the truth Connery saw long before, that the Devil hides in the rules, and in the absence of checks and balances insubordination may be a man's only duty.
Unfortunately the other men cannot share his insight--or see that Hendry is just the symptom, not the disease--and the ending, as often in honest movies of this sort, is despairing. In a final, devastating twist, Connery is forced to watch helplessly as history repeats itself.
Regrettably, what is true for history does not hold for art, for films. They don't make them like this anymore. Probably never will again.",1020124800,113,4789,5.054361567635904

758940,5,6304005946,"Each time I watch The Hill I am stunned.
This is a deeply intelligent film.
The acting, script, story, direction and photography have rarely been equalled. I don't think there is a single weak link, line, or player in this gripping story of human nature under stress.
There is no easy way out in this movie, no fail safe cliches or sentimental heroics. ""Mutinous"" prisoners baying the name of a dead soldier are cowed and brought to heel, by a NCO, who knows full well how to gain control of a crowd.
Each time, you think justice will out, cynical men carefully pull the strings, bark the orders, and carefully manipulate the men to perform their bidding.
Each character grows, each role has depth, each offers insight into the way any of us might react to such circumstances. No one is idealised. Even Roberts laughs at Stevens at one crucial point.
Strange, the director conveys such brutality and corruption but rarely needs any obscenity in the script. I only realised that half way through the film.
I have a great love for Euripides, the Athenian playwright of 484-406 BC, whose ironic tragedies question the accepted brutality in 'civilised' society at war. I think The Hill does the same and to the same superb standard.",977356800,28,1228,4.742990654205608
