5369012,3,B009V9N1CU,"The package was addressed to me or ""current resident"".  I am the one who paid for it, so I don't want someone else to receive it. Otherwise, everything was good.",1435104000,,161,4.366666666666666
5369013,5,B009V9N1CU,"Hilarious, underrated genius! One of the best comedies I've EVER seen!",1420761600,,70,5.454545454545454
5369014,4,B009V9N1CU,"I want to give it 5 stars, but I guess I honestly can't.  The writing is awful, but I still like it because I like the topic.
There are some good lines in it though, I like Sabrina Carpenter's short seen and there are several other funny scenes in the movie.",1399593600,,258,4.0588235294117645
5369015,1,B009V9N1CU,Terrible movie. The trailer makes the movie seem so much better. I was highly disappointed. Save yourself the headache and watch it on Netflix instead. After 5 minutes you'll see what I'm talking about. Bad movie.,1383350400,,213,4.944444444444445
5369016,4,B009V9N1CU,"Silly fun movie about gamers. The main characters are very stereotyped, but most of the other details are close for ""pro""gamers.",1382140800,,128,5.142857142857143
5369017,2,B009V9N1CU,Amateur hour in its highest form. I applaud the effort but I really wish I could've had these two hours back.,1378771200,,109,4.238095238095238
5369018,5,B009V9N1CU,Was purchased for my son. He loves video games and anything tht has to do with them. He's watched it several times now and has recommended it to all of his friends.,1378166400,,164,4.15625
5369019,4,B009V9N1CU,"I actually enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.  I watched it based more on the cast than anything I had heard about it.  Jason Mewes (Jay from Clerks, Mallrats, etc), Casper Van Dien (still only from Starship Troopers), and Matt Shively (who reminds me in this movie of Adam DeVine from Workaholics).
The movie starts off with Cody (Blake Freeman) losing his job and being dumped by his wife.  He plays online video games with his crew of perputual losers.  Their goal is to make it and win a tounament for video games.  Their road trip starts as they head to Los Angeles and to pick up the fourth member of their crew.  There is a hilarious part in a gas station with a young girl berating Cody.  Casper Van Dien's small part was the best of the movie, I thought.  He basically spoofs himself and his whole acting career.  The movie continues with the story getting to the tournament and a predictable finish.
As the movie progressed, I felt more and more like I was watching Dodgeball.  The whole underdog story, the preparation and speech for the game playing, and the finish was very similar.  With that being said, this movie was enjoyable to watch and have some laughable parts.",1375660800,,1196,4.542056074766355
5369020,5,B009V9N1CU,Great little indie gaming movie. Couple of slow moments but some really great moments and a few majorly LMAO moments.,1374019200,,117,4.9
5369021,5,B009V9N1CU,"Gamer movie
Love it because my brother is in it!
Funny
Would recommend this movie
Enjoy
Kids would like it ,some language",1372982400,,121,4.545454545454546
5369022,1,B009V9N1CU,"As a career gamer, fan of Jason Mewes and knowing the potential this movie could have had, I must tell you that it was horrible.  I chuckled once.  Once, I say.  I could have directed better.  Me.  Yes, it's a small budget movie and it's supposed to be fun but I feel like it missed the mark on every attempt.  You watch each ""outrageous"" scene or supposedly ""hilarious"" one-liners and it totally sinks and you even kinda even squirm in your seat from feeling uncomfortable for the actors because the moment was such a flop.  Anyway, this movie pwns nothing.  Now go back to your raids and hopefully you can get that last shiny piece of loot.",1372982400,,642,4.427350427350428
5369023,1,B009V9N1CU,"This movie is awful. Maybe it wasn't targeted towards me, but I doubt that. If you find awful dick jokes, gay bashing, and bad acting, enjoyable, maybe you'll like this movie",1372896000,,174,4.645161290322581
5369024,1,B009V9N1CU,"I watched this game being a gamer myself. As soon as the movie gets going you see shameless plugs for Microsoft and Gears of War 3. This may as well have been a long commercial for the game and Xbox 360. I could have overlooked all that but this movie simply was terrible. This comedy failed to make me laugh much and left me disgusted after the ending. Believe me, you will want to punch out the lead character after you watch this movie. In fact, you will want to punch the actor behind the character for making such a terrible movie. This one has to be as bad as Jay and Silent Bob.",1367971200,,585,4.140350877192983
5369025,1,B009V9N1CU,"I'm the target audience here, but this... its not even like it's 'so bad, it's funny'... it's just empty. Enjoyed the trailer more than the black hole of a movie. Grandmas Boy was funny. This was not funny.",1365811200,,206,4.447368421052632
5369026,2,B009V9N1CU,"Terrible I wish it was better, I was rooting for it, I laughed maybe one time.  I really wish it was better.",1363478400,,108,3.909090909090909
5369027,4,B009V9N1CU,"As someone who doesn't play that many video games, I still found everything very funny. There are plenty of inside video game jokes I was able to pick up on, but not too many where I was lost.",1362873600,3,192,4.078947368421052
5369028,5,B009V9N1CU,"Ok. So like I'm seeing all the negative reviews on allot of sites no doubt from cheapskates who haven't really paid to watch the movie. lol . & I have to say I liked the movie allot. I film things all the time, and know how hard it is to put together a short project so i cant imagine a whole film. The jokes were funny, I agree that some might have not been as funny but what movie is funny all the way through? But again many people just like to find everything wrong with someones work.
I will not do that. I've watched it about 20 times now and still will watch it more. it has allot of my favorite actors in it and is a pioneer movie of its kind. ""If we all listened to haters, we would never even try"" So I say good job Blake Freeman. Can't wait to see another. :)
(& if anyone thinks they can do better than Noobz, then get $350k & make one yourself) oh wait i forgot, YOU CAN'T. smh",1362787200,,890,3.9226519337016574
5369029,5,B009V9N1CU,"The title says it all. It's kind of a Kevin Smith(which I love)-esque type flick about gamers. The cast is awesome and the movie is ridiculous( in a good way). I had been anticipating it's release since I read about it last year. So glad I bought it. I'm not yanking your d**ks right now(you""ll understand after you watch it)!",1362182400,2,326,4.45
5369030,3,B009V9N1CU,"Noobz is a comedy that is pretty funny, but it is too long at 100 minutes. It would have been tighter at 85 or 90 minutes. The funniest scenes are actually cameos courtesy of Lin Shaye, Mindy Sterling, and Casper Van Dien. Jason Mewes basically plays himself, like he does in every other movie he's ever been in.",1361232000,2,312,4.396551724137931
5369031,5,B009V9N1CU,"I've seen a ton of negative reviews about this movie, but honestly I thought it was amazing! Really really funny.",1360713600,3,113,4.7
5369032,2,B009V9N1CU,A few funny lines but strange and second rate movie.  I would not pay 4 bucks for it.  Maybe worth a dollar,1360108800,,107,3.8181818181818183
5369033,3,B009V9N1CU,You have to be a fan of video games and most of the movies made by Kevin Smith to enjoy the movie,1360022400,,97,3.4545454545454546
5369034,3,B009V9N1CU,"I'm really torn on this movie because it has some really great, funny actors, and while I laughed and was thoroughly entertained, it somehow fell flat. Ultimately I think what bothers me is that (outside of Frogger) the only game they even mention is Gears of War, and rather than focusing more on games the whole movie ended up feeling like a heartwarming roadtrip comedy romance.

Either way I would recommend watching it, it's fun. But I don't feel like it's worth watching again.",1359763200,,483,4.75
5369035,5,B009V9N1CU,Just waiting for this movie to become live already! I have been waiting forever now. I'm really excited for the cast and people,1359331200,2,127,4.565217391304348
5369036,5,B009V9N1CU,"I had the opportunity to see Noobz earlier this year at it's LA premiere. Let me tell you that Blake Freeman has worked some serious magic with this, and has struck the previously thought untouchable balance between gaming and comedy. As a gamer, I found the movie hilarious, but I can also see how it would be equally as entertaining to a non-gaming audience. Jason Mewes brought an absolutely perfect performance to the flick, and the rest of the cast rounds it out beautifully. I can't recommend buying this more. Go get it now, and for those of you who prefer Blu-Ray or digital downloads, it looks like neither of those options will be available for the foreseeable future, so DVD is where it's at for Noobz. I can't wait to watch this again... Enjoy!",1354060800,3,756,4.607407407407408
5369037,5,B009V9N1CU,I got to see this film in a screening and I thought it was hysterical. It is finally a great representation of the gaming community without making them look like nerds. 1000% better than Grandma's Boy!,1353888000,2,201,4.611111111111111
5369038,5,B009V9N1CU,"Saw this movie at the E3 premiere and really enjoyed it. As a gaming journalist for 18 years, I have seen every gaming movie made and finally a NON-STUDIO INDIE FILM finally got it right! Thank you for not making me feel inadequate about my industry which happens to be one of the most profitable in the world. Loved the cast and the little girl in the gas station. Not often will I recommend a gaming movie but this is worth seeing.

8544465,5,B009V9N1CU,"Read the negative reviews before buying. One person started off ""As a career gamer, fan of Jason Mewes"" then went into destruction mode. This movie relates to any gamer that has ever gone/or wanted to go to any tourny. #1 decision maker was Adam Sessler, who else remembers those G4 nights!? Movie is worth a watch and worth what I payed, you may pick up on what seems to be the idea of Pixels. (although I'm sure this movie had no influence on that just fun to hear) my only regret is I didn't buy it on DVD and I didn't know of this upon its release. Hey Amazon can you send me a DVD copy please?",1497830400,,598,4.119658119658119

8544471,5,B009V9N1CU,"I learned of this movie when my late fiancs mom gave me a USB drive that belonged to her daughter with multiple movies on it including this. The movie has good moments. It's a bonus that Jason Mewes is in it. On a side note this movie is hilarious for anyone who finds comedy in the struggle of ""coming out"" or sexual confusion. And any Gears of War fan needs this for their collection.",1460505600,,386,4.22972972972973
8544472,4,B009V9N1CU,It's a pretty typical movie for Jason Mewes. But it's still pretty funny,1454544000,,72,4.615384615384615
