2893714,5,B000T2VEHM,I have camped on Cumberland many times. It is one on my favorite places. This video was well done and provided me with new information.,1348963200,,135,4.44
2893715,4,B000T2VEHM,"My son and I have camped on Cumberland a number of times and always stuggle to describe this special place to friends. The DVD was purchased to fill in our knowledge of Cumberland, to allow us to re-visit through the images, and to show others what an unusual and interesting place it is.

It was very professionally photographed and was well paced to hold the viewer's interest.

I was pleased with my purchase.",1290297600,2,412,4.63013698630137
8207614,3,B000T2VEHM,"This was a good basic history I guess, but I was hoping that it would focus more on the wildlife and the one person who fought to save it for the pure love of the island.  Most of the others were motivated by money and greed.  I also suggest the book ""Untamed"" by Will Harlan if you want to get to know the REAL people and inhabitants of Cumberland!",1463875200,,349,4.043478260869565

8207617,4,B000T2VEHM,"If you are a history buff get this book.  It is very detailed and well footnoted.  If you are looking for a relaxing read this one will put you to sleep.  A very well written history of Cumberland Island and includes a very good, well detailed, history of the area from the early settlements forward.  I liked it.",1433376000,,313,4.344827586206897
8207618,3,B000T2VEHM,"This documentary was okay.  I watched in hopes of learning more about Carol Ruckdeschel, after reading Untamed.  I highly recommend the book!  This show was too focused on the Carnegie's... Of course... That's who had all the money.",1427068800,,232,5.052631578947368
8207619,5,B000T2VEHM,Showed this to our middle school students before we actually went to Cumberland... It was good and helped them to understand more once we got there.,1425081600,,148,4.730769230769231
8207620,5,B000T2VEHM,"Arrived in a timely manner as expected; wonderful documentary.  I wished I had seen it before I visited the island; I would've appreciated my visit more, but it does have me yearning to go back for another visit.",1423180800,,212,4.578947368421052
8207621,5,B000T2VEHM,"Outstanding, quality production about the history of Cumberland Island.  Love watching it with visitors to our area.  We live in St. Marys, GA, the gateway to Cumberland Island.",1408233600,,177,5.285714285714286
8207622,1,B000T2VEHM,"A Cumberland Island Fairytale!  The film by William VanDerKloot was deeply disappointing. It simply and completely glossed over the history of the struggle to save Cumerland Island. This struggle included the naturalist Carol Ruckdeschel who became an international authority on sea turtles. Her detailed notes and specimens are now part of the Smthsonian collection.  The film completely ignored the subject of the displaced negro communities; also the stories of the inhabitants who remained and struggled to continue their way of life. Too much credit was given the divisive Carnegie clan and the National Park Service. They were both responsible for some unfortunate misuse of this precious Island. We can be grateful some areas of the island are still wild,though struggling. I now refer all readers of my review to the excellent book by Will Harlan: UNTAMED.",1407024000,4,864,5.345588235294118
8207623,5,B000T2VEHM,"The documentary does a good job of covering the history of the island, including its transition from private to public land.",1393459200,,124,4.9523809523809526
