8056050,3,B0000UJM9K,"This little seen children's fantasy involves a small child stumbling onto the egg of an ancient prehistoric god and before you know it, both the child and the monster are flying around Philippines and straight into our hearts. Okay, that was sappy. The film is pretty entertaining, it's all harmless fun, and cult cinema fans oughta enjoy this Cirio H. Santiago production just as much as their children will. The monster (Vulcan) looks pretty cool in some sequences and cheesy as all get out in others, that's the curse of a low budget production though.

If you like BABY: SECRET OF THE LOST LEGEND, I have a feeling you'll dig this film as well, just don't expect the same caliber acting and production values. This is indeed an odd, little-known Pinoy gem, a film all cult cinema fans should be sure to check out.",1373846400,,817,4.673611111111111
