744490,1,6303980406,"What's the point of studying history?, a high school student here asks. A wise man once said if we forget the mistakes of the past we are doomed to repeat them. And perhaps that is the point of this picturesque tale. The scenery is beautiful, but the advancing of the plot is contrived (throwing characters into the past as observers), and the whole exercise concludes -- unresolved -- as a smarmy, sordid little soap opera. Certainly, the sins of these characters' pasts come back to haunt them. But what do learn from that? In what directions do these characters grow? Little here worth sitting through except a fine performance by Irons and too little screen time from Ethan Hawke.",978998400,8,684,4.756302521008403

744492,5,6303980406,"I believe this underrated movie is one of the best of this decade.  Irons could not be any better--not that I've ever seen him in a bad performance.  The movie follows its own unconventional path.  It journeys back in time  into the lives of the protagonists and Irons' character's family.  The  cinemaphotography is quite good and the physical settings in the  ""moors"" are very beautiful.  Lena Headey plays her character  quite well--in addition to being gorgeous. All of the actors in the movie  are very good.
The movie covers the whole gamut of the dark side of  life:  murder, incest, lust, jealousy, abortion, etc.  It's not a smiley,  feel good piece of Hollywood fluff.  You will not like this movie if that's  what you're looking for.  But if you're looking for a movie that has  something to say about the human condition in an honest and moving  way--this is a good bet.",940636800,6,882,4.684210526315789

The book is a wonder as well.

7857582,5,6303980406,"How bad, how lost a history teacher is Tom Crick (Irons)? So bad that the only time he has his class's attention is when he's teaching the French Revolution -- because of guillotines! And even then he has to milk it, which Irons does beautifully.
Two films I have been engrossed by on PBS while having started watching something else. One was Waterland, kept flipping back to it and eventually didn't turn back to whatever else I was watching, and the second was Cream in Your Coffee, I think it was, by the brilliant deceased Dennis Potter (Singing Detective). The reason, the writing. (In the case of Waterland, based on the stellar book.)
How much our childhood memories are our most dear and memorable is conveyed beautifully in this film. Despite the horrendous incident in their early lives, still it is the time they long for.",1292889600,,833,4.712328767123288
7857583,5,6303980406,"This is an incredible movie from director Stephen Gyllenhaal, father of Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal.  The movie is viewable and enjoyble on multiple layers and from multiple contexts.  Some of us don't understand language, and some of us are not drawn to learn to understand language, until we are attracted to someone who is on the other side of a river's shore, someone beckoning us to speak.  And when we can't find the words, or when we don't know the words, we instinctively fall underwater toward the object of our attraction - sometimes not able to consider much of anything else besides them.

The movie touches on these themes:  Without education, our misunderstandings can drive us to harm ourselves and others.  Most monsters don't know they are monsters.  Most evil is done under flawed justifications of good.  Our definitions of self, religion, justice, ideals, and morality can warp or refine our actions.

The movie addresses these univeral and important questions:  How do you forgive yourself after you may have contributed to the death of someone you loved?  How do you forgive your past selves?  How can you stop the cycle of abandonment after you've been abandoned?  How do you not abandon yourself?

I was never very interested in history as it was taught to me in school, because the histories I was taught avoided controversies.  They proclaimed the ""one true interpretation of the past.""  They were watered down stories that didn't tell us many of the key things that really happened.

Histories that are worth learning, remembering & discussing are often the histories polite society doesn't discuss.

The lead character, a teacher, frustratingly asks his student, ""Bloody Hell Price! Why do you make all that extra effort for mathematics and nothing for history?""
His student replies, ""'Cuz math makes sense.""

I personally lost a muse once. ""And that day I discovered there are many ways the world can end. As many ways as there are people.""

As a muse, she started ideas in motion in me, reasoning frameworks that began to make sense of so many of our worlds' crazy histories. ""In one life, there can be more than one ending.  It's been like that in mine.""

The movie suggests:  We may benefit by not believing in any stories that are dependent on falsehoods or omissions.  To start on a path to recovery:  First, find ways to forgive yourself.  Never abandon yourself.  And even if you don't think you deserve forgiveness, move on because if you can't move on, you may do more harm to yourself and others.  And move on because that may be the only way to continue to benefit yourself and others.",1186790400,3,2624,4.835955056179776
7857584,5,6303980406,"It is one of those rare moments in life, when you go to a movie theatre, and just purchase a ticket for the next-best movie, not knowing (or caring) what it is about. In one particular case, this was ""Waterland"", and the money felt well-spent.  The original novel the film is based on is set in England. Incomprehensible as it may seem to some to change the setting to a place in the USA for those parts that describe the adult life of that frustrated and unhappy history teacher, it gives the story added depth. The angle from which the movie develops the plot (a teacher, exiled in the US if you will, is challenged from all sides to defend the value of history) is compelling since it unravels most beautifully and emotionally the teacher's own involvement with it. I do not want to give away what the story twists are, go into the film as I did. But the way the movie uses two different time lines to tell the whole story, and interweaves them artfully, is brillant.  Jeremy Irons (I actually did not know him at the time, believe it or not) is most fitting as the main character. Ethan Hawke, well I guess they had to pick somebode to play a rebellious pupil, is not bad, but his performance does not contol the movie. Sinead Cusack, on the other hand, plays so convincingly the part of the teacher's wife, still hunted by the common past, that this role is sort of stuck to her in my view.",982886400,28,1395,4.361538461538461
