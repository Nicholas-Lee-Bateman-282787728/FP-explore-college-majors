8443920,1,B002GLG5PK,really dumb I watched 15 minutes of this movie and it was so stupid .I  think there is only the husband and wife in the entire movie they are talking a lot and no action. Don't  waste your time.,1506556800,,194,3.948717948717949
8443921,5,B002GLG5PK,"Black comedy, yes. A bit slapstick, definitely. But the fantasy(?) ramblings of Glenn, played by Liev Schreiber, bring this fun movie to one you should watch with a close friend. A very close friend.",1413676800,,199,4.882352941176471
