7951352,5,B00005QW8S,"I was looking for a change of pace. I lift weights, do power yoga and toning but I wanted to do some work on the ball. I bought a new TKO ball and took this old tape out of my library.

I really enjoyed it. It's fun and easy to do. It's easy on injuries and sore spots. But, at the same time, you feel you get a good workout.

The day after this workout I was surprised at how sore my legs were and how I had a slight burn in the abs. I was surprised because I lift weights regularly and am in very good condition. I seldom have any ""good"" pain after an ab workout and never much after any workout. So you can imagine my surprise when I did with what some people might think of as a ""sissy"" workout.

Believe me, this is not a girlie men workout.

You mostly work your core and lower body. Not much to offer the upper body. But that's okay as there are many other ways to hit other areas. For a once-a-week workout or when you want some fast toning and a little fun, grab this tape. You'll enjoy it.",1162771200,,999,3.9306930693069306
7951353,4,B00005QW8S,I received my tape and instantly began my workout.  I thought the video did and excellent job of going through the exercises.  You can definitely tell a difference in your abdominal muscles after using the tape just once!,1115942400,2,221,4.7894736842105265
7951354,5,B00005QW8S,"I started using this tape after using nine other Pilates-ball related tapes, and find myself using it two or three times a week with outstanding results.  I had trouble with the oblique exercise done on one's knees with the waist draped over the ball.  To keep the ball from flying across the room, I now rest the ball on the corner of a couch which is against a wall.  I find all the exercises flow well, one into the other, and I have had absolutely no problem understanding what to do next.  I have lost two inches from my waist, have lost two pant sizes and the roll around my abs is almost gone--after using this tape for six weeks, along with Suzanne Deason's tapes for abs, lower body and upper body, and Colleen Craig's On The Ball tape.  I use a combination of Suzanne's tapes along with Colleen's tape and Liz Gillies Body Sculpt tape six days a week for a total of 1-1/2 hours a day. I am 56 years old and need to lose a lot of inches as a result of lack of exercise after becoming disabled 12 years ago.  I will continue using this tape faithfully because it works!!!",1090972800,3,1079,4.264705882352941
7951355,5,B00005QW8S,I thought this video was great. I really felt it in my abs and thighs and the instructor was pleasant. It was nice to do pilates on the ball. Something a little different. I would recommend this video because you do feel your muscles work with this one. Liz Gillies is a great instructor.,1038355200,,288,4.351851851851852
7951356,1,B00005QW8S,"This video is very calming and slow paced, so if that's what you're looking for, then buy it.  I wanted total concentration on a really hard ab workout for the exercise ball and this woman is just too slow for me.",1022630400,16,213,4.195121951219512
7951357,3,B00005QW8S,"The instruction and the exercises presented in this video were of an excellent calibur.  However, the poor production quality and, I hate to say it, incredibly annoying music score, took away from the overall presentation.  That said, if you are looking for a good, easy to follow workout using an excercise ball this tape can deliver in that aspect.",1011657600,27,350,4.915254237288136
