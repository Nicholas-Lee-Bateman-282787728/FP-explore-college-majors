The essential story is one which has been told many times with different protagonists, and it has reportedly happened in reality, in one form or another, with different protagonists over the years.",1484352000,,427,4.783783783783784
8187688,4,B000OYNUEK,I actually haven't seen it in years so I'm just now picking it up. My sifu is one of the actresses in it so I just HAD to get it! Enjoy!,1302739200,,136,3.4193548387096775
8187689,5,B000OYNUEK,This is a great film and difficult (until recently) to find...very nicely done with wonderful drama and gong-fu (Bagua). Worth every cent of it's cost...,1224806400,,153,5.16
8187690,4,B000OYNUEK,"I have watched this movie when I was in junior high school in Indonesia. That was in betamax video with no subtible. Although my parent can understand and speak Chinese, I only had a little explanation about this movie. It took me couple of times to watch and understand this movie. The story is all about struggle and hard time in those days in China where somewhere in China was filled with many foreign occupations and settlements. Most of Foreigners thought that China was so weak. But they are not! they have their own traditional fist of martial art to prove that they are not weak. If you do know Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury, If you do know Jackie Chan's Drunken Master 2 or if you do know Jet Lee's Once Upon A Time in China 1,2&3? And the latest Jet Lee's movie Fearless? You will love this PRIDE's DEADLY FURY. Wish this movie has the English subtitle.. :)",1200096000,,863,4.4
8187691,2,B000OYNUEK,"Pride's Deadly Fury is a great Chinese martial arts film.  I was very happy to finally see the first DVD edition of this classic for sale on Amazon.

  However, when I received my copy I was disappointed to find that while this was an all region DVD, there were no subtitles.  So if you do not speak Chinese you will miss all the nuances of this film.  This is too bad as what makes this a great film is the story and character development along with the martial arts action.

So the film Pride's Deadly Fury gets 5 stars but the DVD gets itself get 2 stars.  If someone produces a subtitled version or even a dubbed version there will be plenty of martial arts movie fans who will buy this. But for now, unless you speak Chinese......",1178841600,4,735,4.27536231884058
