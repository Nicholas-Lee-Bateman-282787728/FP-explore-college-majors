8207651,4,B000T3A5ZS,"The 2000 Qubec film, ""L'Invention de l'amour"" (RemStar 22034, as released on DVD in North America, for those who may prefer that to this VHS tape of the film) is a work that reflects very much the modern, rootless, and thoroughly secular life of current French-Canadian society (or, for that matter, of French-European life, too).  The film is very strong on the confused and/or mixed sensibility, something to which this viewer, having lived in Qubec for more than half of the years of an already long life, is well accustomed and attuned, but which simply may elude or bore North American Anglophone viewers.  So, stand warned: this is not a film bursting with action, other than a lot of sex scenes tastefully filmed.  The values and the loves portrayed of of the film's characters are in a permanent state of flux.

David LaHaye, as Antoine, the young author having published two novels, is a good-looking actor with a fairly prolific number of filmed roles to his credit.  Here he is in his most appealing mode, with a richly bushy abundance of auburn hair, a sleekly trim (lightly and pleasingly muscled, not brawny) physique, and a finely featured, sweetly raffish face with semi-shaved (but not yet bearded) chin and a moustache-in-the making.  In short, LaHaye is as sexy a studmuffin as many viewers ever might desire to see, especially when he is so often partially or fully out of his clothes, although there is no full frontal (i.e., with genitals visible) nudity per se!

The women are variable in personality and physical type. Charlotte (Pascale Monpetit) is a believably ordinary housewife who finds herself unwittingly on the prowl, and who is on her way to looking rather too maternally homely, but who not yet is without her feminine charms. lisabeth (Delphine Brodeur) is as torridly sensuous as one could imagine of a gorgeous young prostitute (bisexual in her personal life) who reciprocates, to a degree, Antoine's sexual attraction to her but also hankers for Charlotte, which makes for a temporarily workable threesome.  Matina (Irne Stamou) is an ordinary-looking, sensitive and slight young woman, whose appearance in the film is briefer than that of the other women who bed down with Antoine (or, in Matina's case, have done so in the past). Matina remains Antoine's literary muse, but one with whom Antoine had broken off their intimate relationship due to his never-ending indecision to commit himself fully to one woman; nor can he now reconnect again with Matina as her lover.

The sea, since childhood, always has fascinated Antoine, and, feckless and hesitent lover that he is (more sexually potent than emotionally connected to his women), he leaves behind his life in the French-Canadian metropolis and his lovers there and takes to the sea, whether as on the way to settle elsewhere or thenceforth to embark upon a seafaring, nomadic manner of life is not clear.

This is a lovely and very sensual film if one can share its sensibilities (vicariously if not in one's own life) which are so rife in modern franco-latin culture.  For those who prefer their romance more predictably enacted and packaged, this movie is one to ponder over a bit before purchasing, unless David LaHaye's extraordinarily sexy persona appeals overwhelmingly enough, anyway, as it very easily can do, to decide the issue.",1308009600,,3334,4.989189189189189
