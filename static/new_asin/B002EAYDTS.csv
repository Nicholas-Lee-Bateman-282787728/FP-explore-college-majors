3916424,3,B002EAYDTS,"While at his best in comedy and suspense, Cary Grant liked to do something different on occasion (see ""Destination Tokyo"") and this script caught his eye. He was a generous fellow, too, and gave writer Richard Brooks the chance to direct his first movie (twenty-three more would follow).

According to the book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (UWiscPress, 2011, and available on amazon.com), the writer-turned-director had Spencer Tracy lined up to play Dr. Ferguson. Once Tracy dropped out and Grant dropped in, MGM demanded that Brooks revise the script and turn the doctor's young daughter (destined to be kidnapped to force the doctor to operate on the dictator) into a new wife, the feeling being that Cary Grant always needed a love interest to attract female moviegoers.

The studio refused to let Brooks film on location, though he was allowed to visit South America for research. Brooks made do with the MGM back lot when filming began. The Production Code wouldn't allow Dr. Ferguson to kill the dictator - revenge was no excuse for murder - and Brooks rewrote the original ending to accommodate the censors.

Luckily for the first-time director, Grant and Jose Ferrer headed up a great cast. The movie is better than its box office at the time. (The newspaper ads back then tried to fool people into thinking it was a comedy. Ticket buyers likely were peeved when they got a drama instead.) I suspect that today's audiences would be more accepting of Cary Grant in an off-beat role. The studio lost money on ""Crisis"" but kept Brooks directing for the next 10 years.

Cary Grant is excellent in this thriller.

3916426,4,B002EAYDTS,"Cary Grant has an unusual role in Crisis. He plays a doctor who is abducted so that he will operate on a dictator. So Cary is in a hostage situation in which he is powerless. Unlike in North by Northwest his character is abducted because he is what he is, and he has to make an ethically difficult choice which will not make him a hero, no matter what he decides. In the next step of the story he meets the opposition - and those folks are not clean cut good guys either. As a matter of fact, they are as brutal and uninspiring as the dictator they want to topple (does this remind you of some actual events?). No wonder that the ending is somwhat a downer which might be the reason for this movie's obscurity.
Cary Grant acquits himself quite well and his character reflects the anger of a hostage memorably. The greatest and most interesting performance is the one of Jose Ferrer who plays the suave but crazy dictator. He demands that the operation be effectuated in a salon of the presidential palace which has to be transformed into an operating theatre. This helps give the movie a distinct surrealistic feel.",1283472000,2,1115,4.470588235294118
3916427,4,B002EAYDTS,"This film is manufactured on demand by Warner Brothers, so make sure you check to see if you got what you ordered. In one case I ordered ""Beast of the City"" and received ""Edison the Man"". In this case I received ""Crisis"" as ordered, but its condition was such that it appeared to have been packed in its case by Catwoman, with her claws extended. Also note that this is a DVD-R with no extra features except a trailer.

The film itself is quite good. Cary Grant stars as a famous neurosurgeon who is vacationing in a South American country with his new bride. The pair are subject to a ""friendly abduction"" when the current president of that country, Raoul Farrago (Jose Ferrer), learns of his presence. You see, the president has a brain tumor, and due to the fact that his country is on the verge of civil war, he dares not travel to another country for the operation he needs to save his life.

Farrago is a tyrant who claims that he must be so because democracy would never work in his country. His people are illiterate children, he says, and wouldn't know what to do with freedom if they had it. However, being a national ""father image"" doesn't prevent the president from stealing everything in the country that isn't nailed down. The president's wife does a great job of emulating Evita Peron before much was really known about her. Then there is Gilbert Roland as the leader of the opposition. He wants to make his people free, as long as he gets to be the new dictator. Roland does a great job with this role. How far he has progressed here since his early days as an actor at the dawn of sound.

So the question is - does Grant owe a service to the dictator by saving his life with a delicate operation only so that patient can go on being a killer and a thief, or would the death of this tyrant better serve mankind? If you throw the safety of his wife into the balance - what decision does the doctor make?

The trailer was rather interesting for one specific reason. Apparently MGM was planning to build up the leading lady, Paula Raymond, as a promising new star. Her movie career never really panned out, though she did have a good success in television.

The quality of the video and audio in this film were excellent, even though it has not been specifically remastered for this release.",1247875200,16,2304,4.4373522458628845

8367056,5,B002EAYDTS,"This is an old classic (which I saw as a very young man) which has more than stood the test of time.  Bravo performances by the greats Cary Grant and Jose Ferrar are wonderfully complimented by a superb supporting cast.  The plot is very straightforward.  The dictator ""Farrago"" rules a small (never named) South American country.  Grant and his wife are vacationing there.  Grant is a neurosurgeon and as it happens, Farrago (Jose Ferrar) is suffering from a brain tumor.  Farrago's trustees kidnap grant and his wife and demand that he perform the necessary operation because Farrago does not trust the doctors in nearby (hostile) countries and no doctors in his own country are qualified.  This leads to excellent drama and character portrayals, mainly by Cary Grant and Jose Ferrar in their respective roles.

This one is excellent entertainment.  In my opinion the most memorable parts are when Ferrar (dictator Farrago) attempts to justify his dictatorship to his doctor (Grant).  ""In America, you have signs that say ""no spitting"".  Here--they spit on the sign.""

I would recommend this fine film to anyone.  RJB.",1473206400,,1120,5.054644808743169
