2244989,4,B0007UQ264,"First let me say that if you like shows like The Office (both UK and USA) or The Larry Sanders Show or Curb your Enthusiasm, you will love this show.  Like those shows its shot in a documentary style that makes it feel as if you are in these characters lives.

I first saw an episode of The Newsroom on PBS.  I was immediately struck by the genius of Ken Finkleman (the shows main star, writer and director).  Where The Office shows you a satirical view of office life The Newsroom shows you an equal satirical view of a Toronto newsroom's life.  From how ""leads"" in the news cast are chosen (i.e. higher body count) to the mundane issues that George the news director gets hung up on (getting a parking space in the buildings garage) you will find yourself laughing at others misfortune.

With all the genius in this show I was very disappointed by the three episode long finale.  I guess it was trying to make a statement about the narcissistic ways of George but it just wasn't funny (thus the 4 instead of 5 stars).  That being said, the last episode (where the characters are transported to a political situation) was again genius.  This DVD is well worth your money.",1152835200,10,1172,4.464788732394366
2244990,5,B0007UQ264,"This is one of those shows that you can watch over and over again because it is so well done.  While watching this I say to myself, ""If I pulled this kind of stuff in my office, I would be terminated"".  But it is realistic because the people pulling off these shenanigans are high up in the bureaucracy of this TV station.  And everybody delivers their lines with a straight face.  The First Season is supposed to be the best and I have only seen the First Season.  It is hard to believe that the quality can be maintained throught the 2nd and 3rd seasons.  On the back of the case liner on the DVD set there appears to be a circular stain left by a coffee mug and I believe this is done intentionally because there are similar marks on both DVDs and also there are similar marks on the internal info sheet.  It's a little disconcerning because it initially appeared to me that I had received a defective copy but I don't think that is the case.  I would like to get input from other customers about the appearance of their graphics material.  Do you also see these marks on the DVD artwork?",1149811200,5,1091,4.282926829268293
2244991,5,B0007UQ264,"Im still surprised that I'm the first person to wright a review for this show.  The reason being is that it's easily one of the funniest I have ever seen.  Although it's categorized as a ""dark"" comedy, I think a better comparison would be to the Larry Sanders Show.  Both shows have a similar format and similar sense of humor. Newsroom takes place in, well you guessed it, a newsroom.  Ken Finkleman stars as the self-absorbed executive producer George Findlay who is constantly trying to protect his image.  Needless to say (and because i don't feel like describing every part of the show), this show is exceptionally funny.  If you like other shows such as Seinfeld, the Simpsons, Scrubs, the Office, Family Guy, Arrested Development or any other comedy ever made, I guarantee you will love this show.",1143849600,9,804,4.7898550724637685
2244992,5,B0007UQ264,"It starts with 5 minutes of shocking, mind opening, jaws dropping opening, and followed by additional hours of statement about our current society ... American style of 'real' news ... really ???",1399593600,,195,5.125
2244993,5,B0007UQ264,"THIS IS SUCH A WELL-DONE SHOW!  INTERESTING CHARACTERS, PLOT LINES, ETC.  CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY IT WASN'T AN INSTANT HIT.",1372982400,,120,4.95
2244994,1,B0007UQ264,"I bought this product by mistake. I thought it was the HBO series THE NEWSROOM but this was as far away from that show as cottage cheese is from an Aston Martin DB9 The packaging is misleading and at a glance it is an easy mistake to make. To be fair I have not see the whole series just one episode, I figured I own this Turkey maybe it will surprise me..... it didn't. The writing is HACK the chemestry between the charactors is nil and the story has a seen it all before on better shows quality I didn't bother to waste my time on the rest of the shows. In truth had I bought it at a real store I would have not have purchased it in the first place. I will now order the HBO NEWSROOM and place this on the shelf with PUNKINHEAD,BORAT and the rest of the DVD's I don't ever watch",1368835200,5,781,3.9808917197452227
2244995,2,B0007UQ264,"It did not get my attention in the beginning.  After the first 10 minutes of nothing but talking, that was enough for me.  Sorry, but this is my opinion.",1364256000,,153,4.241379310344827
2244996,5,B0007UQ264,Will there be a season 2? You got me hooked on season 1. Loved the romantic tension between the 2 main characters. Loved the realism of the newsroom and the stories. I need a second season.,1359072000,,189,4.277777777777778
2244997,3,B0007UQ264,Funny and quite well done but needs a bit more variety in the story line. The hand held camera type of filming seems like a gimmick and is exhausting for the eyes. Hope they drop that in the next series.,1344729600,5,203,4.1
2244998,5,B0007UQ264,"I first came across this show on PBS around ten years ago.  I loved the show and was happy when it finally came out on DVD.  There are not a lot of extras, but I'm okay with it.  One of my favorite shows of all time.",1286928000,3,216,3.652173913043478
2244999,5,B0007UQ264,"I loved the first season of this series.  It beats ""The Office"" for satire.  Well worth renting or buying.",1250380800,,106,4.526315789473684
2245000,5,B0007UQ264,"The brilliant three-part `Meltdown' in Season One of The Newsroom takes the obsessive insouciance of Finkelman's lead character to heights of dissociation, astonishingly, hilariously, amidst the imminence of nuclear disaster.  The cast is superbly presented by their own talent and precise direction.  For you who appreciate George F. Walker and Federico Fellini, along with Ken Finkleman - watch this!  You will be delighted.",1237593600,,426,5.73015873015873
2245001,5,B0007UQ264,"I couldn't believe what I was watching when I first saw these episodes air on PBS (uh oh, I owe them some money).  I was delighted.  Ken Finkleman must be evil and must be a genius. I love him!  I taped these off of the tv so I can't say if owning dvds is worthwhile.  This is very good and different television.  It's smart and quietly terrible.  If you like Rick Gervais and Arrested Development, then this series ought to make you laugh.",1163030400,11,440,4.240963855421687
