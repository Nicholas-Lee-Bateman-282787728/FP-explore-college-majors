7902797,4,B000003KAG,"At first glance ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Episode 40, ""Tuvix"" (Story by Andrew Shepard Price & Mark Gaberman, Teleplay by Kenneth Biller, Aired on May 6, 1996) looks like the flip side of a storyline we have seen before in ""Star Trek"" when a character is split in half.  Fans of ""Star Trek"" will remember this happening to Captain Kirk in the original series and to B'Elanna Torres on ""Voyager.""  In ""Tuvix"" the transporter takes Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and fuses them into a single being, named Tuvix (Tom Wright).
The set-up is that Tuvok and Neelix were on an away mission where they find an orchid that could be useful and when they beam back to ""Voyager"" what arrives is a creature that not only fuses the two crewmembers together but also includes all their memories and talents.  Of course the orchid has properties that affected the transporter and caused Tuvix to be created, and while the crew explores ways of undoing the merger, Tuvix tries to find his place on ""Voyager.""
The character that is most affected by the transformation is Kes (Jennifer Lien), who had an intimate relationship with Neelix while Tuvok was her tutor.  Having the two most important people on ""Voyager"" now being together in one body is even more unsettling to Kes than it is to Tuvix.  One of the nice things about this episode is that it takes place over the course of several weeks, during which Kes struggles with her conflicting emotions and Tuvix becomes part of the crew.  This is important because all of the above is simply prelude to the big issue of the episode.
With the sense of irony inherent in such television episodes, just when everyone on ""Voyager"" has adjusted to Tuvix, the Doctor (Robert Picardo) discovers a way to bring back Tuvok and Neelix.  The only problem is that Tuvix does not want to give up his existence, arguing that to do so is to effectively kill him.  The Doctor refuses to act without Tuvix's consent, putting Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) in the position of having to make yet another tough decision.
While there is certainly a ""right to life"" subtext to the issue, in terms of the history of ""Voyager"" the decision faced by Janeway this time around is what is really interesting.  After all, through the first two seasons of the series Janeway has repeatedly put the needs of others before her own crew; it is how ""Voyager"" ended up in the Delta Quadrant in the first place and she has repeatedly made similar decisions.  In that context, ""Tuvix"" is its most provocative.
It certainly would have been interesting to see this particular plot line played out over the course of several episodes, since the final resolution is never in doubt.  But if it lasted a few episodes it would have had fans rethinking their position and made the conclusion and Janeway's final decision even more dramatic.",1061683200,3,2840,4.728744939271255
7902798,5,B000003KAG,"To me this was the first really great episode of Voyager. It's not that I hadn't thought there were other equally superior shows prior to this, but 'Tuvix' is a really daring and effective episode.  As far as transporter accidents go Trekkies know well to expect this phenomenon to appear at least once in every series of Trek sooner or later.  This particular 'accident' is without a doubt one of the most philosophically challenging scenarios that the Trek writers ever created.
While beaming up from the planet surface after an away mission, Neelix and Tuvok are inexplicably melded into one individual.  This individual has the life essence of each of them, possessing their memories, personality traits, skills, etc.  After being isolated in Sick Bay and examined thoroughly by The Doctor, Tuvix - as he christens himself - assumes the duties that Tuvok had on the bridge, as ""that would be the most logical step to take.""  Tuvix proves to be a valuable addition to the Voyager crew, capable of assuming the duties of both Tuvok and Neelix (though not simultaneously).  Two weeks pass before The Doctor realizes a way to return Neelix and Tuvok to their proper and separate composite forms.  Tuvix quite naturally doesn't want to surrender to the procedure as it would effectively kill him...and this is the fundamental issue of the story.
Though it can be argued that 'Tuvix' bites off more than it can chew, the story works well and is undeniably a Star Trek milestone.  The ethical complications that are created deserve more time to be discussed than a sixty-minute television show can provide.  But what's on screen is spellbinding and even a bit unsettling.  The final resolution is an issue that invites and inspires some radical debates among fans - read the other reviews here as well.  ""At what point did he become an individual and not a transporter accident?"" Janeway asks Chakotay rhetorically.  Indeed, this is a problem that Starfleet Academy could not have provided any starship captain with training or precedent.  Along those same lines I would ask, ""When does he become a Federation member to be protected by their rules and regulations?""
One of the problems that Tuvix's existence causes is that it creates an unnatural void in Kess' life.  She misses Neelix and feels an overwhelming loss at his absence.  Tuvix though possesses the same romantic feelings that Neelix had for Kess, and he attempts to both console and propose a romance with her.  She tries to see in him that possibility but it proves unacceptable to her, as she can't seem to get beyond her loss.  The complexities of the situation compel her to visit Janeway in her quarters.  It's quite natural that these two women would gravitate toward each other in this crisis.  As Kess explains the void she feels because of Neelix's absence Janeway expresses the same sense of loss over Tuvok, a close friend and trusted confidant.  By opening up to Kess we see that Janeway is as vulnerable and prone to emotional susceptibilities as any of the crewmembers.  She is not a stone cold stoic but genuine even to a fault.  She talks of the crew's isolation from their loved ones, expressing a great desire to see her husband Tom again which she compares to Kess' sense of loss.  Though Harry eagerly volunteers to help The Doctor find a resolution, the men of the Voyager don't show any regret of loss over either Neelix or Tuvok.  Not until the end of the episode do any of them begin to experience any genuine feelings about this conundrum.  And maybe that's true of most men - but not all.
Throughout the final act of the show Tuvix defends his life admirably, valiantly when his existence is challenged; he likens it unto an execution, which doesn't make Janeway's decision any easier.  The Doctor takes a curious stand in Sick Bay during the final scene.  He refuses to administer the treatment that will restore Neelix and Tuvok because Tuvix doesn't want to die - The Doctor cites the familiar Hippocratic Oath, claiming he can't purposely cause harm to a patient against their will.  But isn't he conveniently forgetting about the lives of Neelix and Tuvok?
'Tuvix' is an exceptional and superior episode of Voyager that features some of the most moving scenes of the entire series.  Tom Wright is absolutely unbelievable in the role of Tuvix, bringing more nuance and realism to the character than the Trek creators probably thought possible!  This is a video that is most definitely worth having for your Star Trek collection.  Get it today!",1045958400,7,4534,4.849350649350649
7902799,1,B000003KAG,"I found this episode one of the worst of Voyager.  I like Tuvok, and I like Neelix, but combined as one they're absolutly atrocious!!!  Also, Neelix/Kes scenes are bad enough, but Tuvix/Kes is worse.",1004832000,,199,4.823529411764706
7902800,3,B000003KAG,"This episode of Star Trek Voyager is interesting and in it's own way, thought-provoking....but I do not consider it a ""must see"" for Voyager fans.
The basic plot involves a transporter accident in which the characters of Tuvok and Neelix are merged into one ""person"".  The resulting character, of course, resembles both of these very different individuals only somewhat.
The story only gets interesting, however, when we discover that ""Tuvix"" has taken on an identity and personhood of his own and does not want to ""die"" in order to return both Tuvok and Neelix to their previous forms.  There is much angst on the part of Janeway regarding the decision to order Tuvix to submit to the separation procedure....but of course we all know how this one will end, so there is not much mystery!
The episode in enjoyable enough, but like Kes, I found myself being very uncomfortable with this character of Tuvix.  I'll give this episode 3 stars.",997142400,,938,4.85
7902801,3,B000003KAG,"In ""Tuvix,"" Starship Voyager crewmembers Neelix and Tuvok beam down to a planet in search of useful plant specimens. But a strange transporter anomaly occurs when their shipmates try to beam them back. Instead of getting back two crewmembers, a single being materializes on the transporter pad. He is a genetic and psychological fusion of Neelix and Tuvok, and eventually calls himself Tuvix.
This is a great science fiction concept. Tom Wright delivers a truly outstanding performance as the being who retains the memories and skills of both Neelix and Tuvok, but who emerges as his own unique and intriguing character. The makeup design of ""Tuvix"" adds to the effectiveness of the characterization. The sci-fi ""technobabble"" used to explain the origins of Tuvix is particularly well-written.
This being an episode of a continuing television series, we expect that Neelix and Tuvok will be restored to the crew by episode's end. And herein lies my unease with this episode. Without giving away too much, I found the conclusion of this episode to be disturbing. The script raises complex moral and metaphysical issues which, to me, are not adequately addressed. Furthermore, the final scene strikes me as particularly rushed and unsatisfying. ""Tuvix"" could have been one of the greatest episodes of ""Star Trek: Voyager""--it certainly contains one of the best guest performances in the whole series' run. But the failings of either the script or the editing room detract from the episode as a whole.",987465600,2,1498,5.1687242798353905
7902802,5,B000003KAG,"Look, I'm not a big Voyager fan. In fact, until 7 of 9 showed up, I had quit watching Voyager in favor of the Crocodile Hunter.  But the pre-7 of 9 seasons of Voyager were not totally a TV wasteland.  The episode about Tuvix, though a bit talky, is an excellent bit of television.  I found myself rooting for Tuvix at the expense of Tuvok (one dumb Vulcan), Neelix (I hate him) and Tes (too bad she left the show).  This show combines a great moral dilemma and a fairly sound script with some pretty good acting.  I rate it 5 stars... but remember this is Star Trek, VOYAGER, so the rating system for it cannot be as tough as it would be for the rest of the Star Trek universe.",984268800,2,677,4.137404580152672
