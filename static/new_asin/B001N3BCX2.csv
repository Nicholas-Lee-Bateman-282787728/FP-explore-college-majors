8323095,2,B001N3BCX2,"First of all, Christopher Parkening was my introduction to classical guitar and the reason I started playing. His technique, his tone and his incredible sound quality blew me away.

I was so excited to get this DVD but here is what I think:

(1) Repertoire - no surprise here. Parkening more or less re-recorded Segovia's back catalog. But I have no problems with the pieces here. There are some of the most beautiful ever written for or transcribed for the classical guitar. My favorites on this DVD are Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring and Fantasia X. I'd have preferred something other than Romance or Prelude No. 1 (Recuerdos, the Bach Chaconne etc).

2. Sound and picture quality - the picture quality was adequate. The sound quality is ATROCIOUS. To be absolutely clear, Parkening is outstanding throughout. What an incredible player! However, when I first turned the DVD on, I raised the volume so I could adequately hear the introduction. But as soon as Parkening started to play, you could barely hear it. The sound is muddy and distant - very, very disappointing.

3. Segovia piece - I have no idea why this is included. That Segovia was Parkening's mentor is well documented. He already released a tribute CD to him so why include this film? Let Segovia's heirs release footage of the man. A DVD of Parkening should surely be able to stand on its feet.

4. Award ceremony - the overview of Parkening's career is fine but well known, I'm sure, amongst guitar fans. I'd rather watch an interview with Parkening discussing his technical ideas about the instrument, choice of repertoire, touring and recording experiences etc...

5. Repetition - some of the pieces here are repeated within the different ""feature titles."" Did he perform so rarely live that we have no other pieces to choose from?

In the end, a passable DVD that does not do justice to a phenomenal musician.",1277942400,6,1877,4.8105590062111805
8323096,2,B001N3BCX2,"This dvd was really disappointing. One thing is that most of the videoclips are from the beginning of the 70's and the dvd shows nothing of what Parkening is up to today. Knowing that there exists at least some footage from latter years (check it out on youtube)I really can't say why that is. Another thing is; knowing and thinking Parkening is one of the greatest guitarists on the planet I really can't see why Andres Segovia is featured at such length in this dvd. It's ok that Christopher Parkening likes to mention that he got a lot of great advice and help playing-wise from Segovia and that the latter was his mentor but Parkening is really a fantastic guitarist in his own right with quite a unique style of his own. I do however think that Parkening perfected the (very romantic) Segovia-style but he really has incredible integrity on his own and really is second to noone. He has also introduced a lot of new guitartranscriptions of truly great music to the public. Donal Henahan in the New York Times once said it all: ""Parkening's playing is so intelligent,sensitive and adept that one can forget everything but the music"".",1235606400,13,1137,4.69
8323097,2,B001N3BCX2,"Christopher Parkening is one of the finest musicians to play the guitar.  For some time I have been hoping he would put together a video of his performances in a way that was similar to Julian Bream's ""My Life in Music.""  I was expecting/hoping to see solo performances in digital quality, set in picturesque surroundings, capturing his singular talent and haunting beauty of the guitar.  This film fell way short of that expectation.  The best/only footage of him playing is from the 1970's, the video quality is choppy, the audio mediocre at best, and the selection of pieces doesn't do the instrument justice.  The short video footage of Segovia from the 1950's is far, far superior to that of Parkening and much more enjoyable to watch.  It's unfortunate, but this video does not capture Mr. Parkening's true talent and ability to interpret the many pieces within his repertoire. This video will not add much value to any guitar DVD collection and will sadly disappoint the serious guitar aficionado.",1234569600,18,1004,4.946428571428571
