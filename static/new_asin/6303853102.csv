714771,2,6303853102,"I loved this movie when it came out, and watching it 22 years later I have no idea why I liked it so much. Its incredibly shallow in how it treats its characters, and Cher is really kind of a jerk when I think more about it. She called someone else a snob, while bagging on the skateboarder who actually showed an interest in Tai. I know the movie tried to show Cher as someone that was actually more deep than she portrayed, but there always seemed to be a selfish end in her helping others. The idea that she needed to change Tai into an image of herself doesnt really resonate anymore. Its interesting that something that might have seemed good 20 years ago, is a bit offensive now. Leave people be to be who they are. Maybe Ive just gotten old, but I really dislike this movie now. I don't even find it entertaining",1512777600,,819,4.256410256410256

She's charming, effervescent and delightful to watch as Cher. The supporting cast embraces the goofiness of the movie and all do a great job. You could say the movie is a satirical commentary of youth during that time but it never feels mean spirited or heavy handed. Some of the ""lingo"" is dated, but it doesn't matter because the whole movie is ridiculous over the top fun. Definitely worth watching.",1507852800,6,548,4.840425531914893

714951,5,6303853102,"It's actually not a bad version of the Austen classic ""Emma"". The film would be much much longer if it had most of the book. For this film, the pieces they used worked. As cheesy teenage flicks go, this one is a classic on its own. Not for the Emma storyline but it's specific illustrations of the era of the film. This is definitely a mid-late 90s movie! I mean knee high tights with high heeled Mary Janes, plaid skirts, mini backpacks and guys of every race in oversized jeans, AS IF!!! Lol.... This film is a collectible.

The style is so iconic and anyone who has seen the movie knows what a person means when they say Cher's yellow plaid school girl outfit.  It is interesting to see how at times Cher and Dionne's outfits play off of each other (like the afore mentioned plaid outfit that matches with Dionne's black and red version).  It is also interesting to see how the costume designer uses the clothing to set the different social groups at the school apart.  Tai's transformation is an example of this from her journey to grungier new girl to part of the higher social group.  Again, a fun movie!",1497139200,,735,4.481203007518797

715086,5,6303853102,"Clueless, despite the almost unbearably shallow and overly cheesy lives of Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and her high school friends; Dionne (Stacy Dash), Tai (Brittany Murphy), and love interest/ex-step-brother, Josh, (Paul Rudd) (yes you read that right ex-step-brother) all living in Beverly Hills is a not so classic coming of age story where a girl learns about her true friends, and just might find some love.

No matter your sense of humor, you will chuckle at many, if not all the one liners this movie brings to light. With Silverstones ability to deliver totally vapid lines such as pronouncing Haitians and Hate-ians for an entire monologue, describing her lack of a sex life as being hymenally challenged, or how she cant take a hint that her crush, Christian, in fact is gay, will make you crack up, or at least make you think twice about what they just said. The overall meaning of the movie is a bit dense, but thats the beauty of the whole thing, because something so airheady and common, was one of the most viewed movies 1990s and has lines that are definitely as quotable as an Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell film, I know some say might disagree, but to them Id say, ugh, as if.

This relatively simple plot about a high schooler finding love and figuring out life would normally remind you of one of those awful Netflix originals, but Amy Heckerling, writer and producer, makes the movie into something more than just that. If you're having a hard time picturing Heckerlings directing style, some of her other films are, Fast times at Ridgemont High and National Lampoons Vacation. If youve seen either of them, they are also hilarious, and filled with idiotic, and sometimes crude humor.

The script for this film, loosely adapted from Jane Austens, Emma, is brilliant, Amy Heckerling was able engage sarcasm, and the capture of innocence and ignorance of teenage humor without making it gaudy and immature. Heckerling also did a great job of poking fun at some of the beauty and popularity standards of that time such as; all of the girls in the background having nose bandages, or the joking about how something is so bad the mall and daddys credit card cant even fix it.

Between the crazy, and all over the place scene of Dionne accidentally getting on the freeway, or the super zoomed in, way to long kissing scene between Cher and her love interest. The Cinematography is, well, definitely could use some work. At times, the camera moves a little quick, and the way the characters are posed at the beginning of scenes is often counterproductive to the scenes purpose. These two together combined with the idiotic humor could lead to a catastrophic headache for some viewers. Despite this aspect of the film, in some ways, it adds to the overall dramatic feel the movie has as a whole.

For a movie about one teenagers problems Clueless, the cast, writer and director did an outstanding job of bringing different personalities together and giving the audience an airheads view on life and her inability to grasp the concept of driving was genius, and a must see.",1487721600,,3082,4.785714285714286

She takes on a project of transforming the new nerdy girl into one of her own.  Played by Brittany Murphy who I wonder what might have been every time I see her.

715148,5,6303853102,"""Clueless"" is a witty modern-day homage, by imitation, to Jane Austen's novel ""Emma"" published in 1816.  ""Clueless pays special attention to the screwball comedies of the late 1930s and early 1940s and some of the bawdy late restoration plays of the 17th and 18h-century.  It is not  just a puerile teenage film about teenage antics and makeovers, but rather a mature and comical perception of another ""Pygmalion"" situation.  ""Clueless""even has an Elton character as does ""Emma"" in corresponding roles.  So, like ""Emma,"" ""Clueless"" is tightened together with many scenes with witty repartee.  ""Clueless"" will not disappoint you.",1478649600,,628,5.422680412371134

The message of the movie was subtle but clear. This teen girl loves helping people and has great empathy for the underdog.

This is a peek into world of girl teens and their peers. Of course it is fantastical and idealistic, but it was totally entertaining.

715754,5,6303853102,"I love Clueless. I think Clueless was so well received for the same reasons as to why I like it: it gives the audience an inside look at the life of the iconic popular, blond hair, rich, california girl and also shows you that she is as human as the rest of us and goes through ups and downs as well. Although at some time everyone in the movie can be named clueless, the audience sees that there is more to the characters than meets the eye and that this cluelessness is not so much a real thing but an idea that dissolves once each character faces their inner feelings and personalities. My favorite character is Cher because at the end of the day she is true to herself and those around her. She had no reason why to help Tai, or the teachers, or be anything other than the self obsessed girl she was thought to be. Instead, her cluelessness could even be called naive and innocent at the lack of knowledge of how the rest of the world operates just because she doesn't have to worry about it.

715946,5,6303853102,"Released in 1995, ""Clueless"" is a teen dramedy about, Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a rich Beverly Hills high school student who experiences the ups and downs of teen life in Southern California. Cher hangs with her best friend, Dionne (Stacey Dash), and they befriend a new girl who seems to need their help, Ty (Brittany Murphy). Beyond this, Cher looks for romance and finds it in an unexpected person. Justin Walker is on hand as Cher's potential beau, Christian, as is Jeremy Sisto; and Paul Rudd as her sometimes annoying, but always reliable ex-stepbrother, Josh.

Like 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Clueless"" transcends the mediocrity and pitfalls of most teen dramedies and breaks the threshold of greatness. While it's honest about things like dating, sex and cussing, it refuses to overdo any of them and, instead, focuses on the real-life joys, low points and everything in between of a beautiful and goodhearted well-to-do Southern California girl.

The film was a modest hit at the box office and justifiably so. It's hip, smart, honest and heartwarming. Silverstone is precious and lovable in the title role and easily carries the film. Rudd is equally effective as the ex-stepbrother. Dash is utterly stunning and both Walker and Murphy are competent. The film leaves you with a good feeling.

The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in the Beverly Hills and the Los Angeles area.

I didn't find it all that interesting or engaging, barely better then the stuff on the Disney Channel.  As an adult I found Mean Girls much more interesting, funny, realistic and down to earth.

716207,5,6303853102,"I remember my sisters watching this movie so much when it came out that I had it memorized just from passing by the TV room when I was young. After all these years I remembered it fondly but always assumed that it was a girl-satire and therefore required a feminine perspective to understand or relate to the humor, but this is wholly untrue. This is not a girl's movie even though it's oriented toward high school girls. Any man or woman will laugh at this equally without gender exclusion. The satire and interactions are sharp and witty, with so much of the humor being presented in a clever way that requires an attention span above the average movie, but that's fairly typical of satire. This movie will make you laugh each time you watch it because there is so much humor and content that you can miss if you only watch it once or twice.

If you like satire in general without exclusion of specific, chances are you'll love this movie if you like:
Futurama
Black Adder
Simpsons
Zoolander
Kung Pow (uhg)
The Whole Nine Yards
Analyze This/That
Hot Shots
Airplane

And so on, you get the point. This movie isn't dry like most spoofs or satires are these days. It's a comedy that people can relate to best if they simply experienced the 90s, know youth drama well, fashion sense, and general ditzy behavior. You'd have to be pretty reclusive not to catch at least 80% of the jokes presented.",1416960000,,1393,4.5458167330677295

716822,2,6303853102,"The best part of watching a film decades after it originally debuted is that you can gain a fresh perspective.  Clueless is one of those films that as a teen growing up in the 90s, I probably would have adored because it was so relevant, what with its beepers as fashion accessories and its actual fashion accessories, like platform sneakers, beaded chokers, and baby tees.  Now, as an adult during what is nearly the films 20th anniversary, I can say that this flick was highly overrated.

One thing that does remain interesting, though, is the fact that even ditzy people were smarter than what we consider to be dumb nowadays.  I was surprised that these girls weren't as completely out-to-lunch as I had always assumed them to be.  Theyre not even really that stupid - they're just updated versions of the 80s valley girl, portraying what it must be really like to go to high school in L.A.

If these girls had put more thought into their studies than their obviously expensive and complex outfits, or if they would have cared less about changing those around them and simply letting their peers be themselves for who they were, then these girls might have been forces with which to reckon - but then, they also wouldnt make for believable popular girls either.  And we also wouldnt have been subjected to endless requests from our friends in high school to make us over, undoubtedly influenced by the popularity of this film.

The film does, however, get bonus cool points for featuring a David Bowie song (Fashion) within the first two minutes of the film.  And Dan Hedaya does here what he always does best - acts so serious that it turns completely back around and makes him comical, giving him the hands-down funniest line (and delivery) of the entire movie when he tells daughter Chers (Alicia Silverstone) date, Christian (Justin Walker) that no one would miss you if he was forced to kill Christian for doing anything slimy with Cher.

The late Brittany Murphys role here as Tai was her breakout performance, and its always a bittersweet mixture of being enchanted with her and missing yet another star that died too young.  She has a good handle on what sounded like a Brooklyn accent, though it fades in and out and would have been even more hysterical, endearing, and flat-out perfect had she kept it steady throughout the film.

Paul Rudd was a thing here even before Paul Rudd was a thing, which is to say that I remember my teen magazines falling all over him and my being like who?  Though, its easy to see why, since that scene on the stairs near the end of the film is still enough to steal your breath, even all these years later.

Donald Faison looks like one of J.D.s fantasy versions of him from Scrubs, and Cher watches cartoons like Beavis & Butthead and Ren & Stimpy for apparently no other reason than to be 90s relevant and to be on the receiving end of a quick quip from Rudds Josh.  It is only in watching Clueless for the first time in the year 2014 that you realize just how much of a fad film this flick truly was.",1406505600,,3049,4.558608058608058

717173,5,6303853102,"Just what the doctor ordered! !! After way too much seriousness this reliably funny movie is great to change the mood. Tired of going to bed and trying to sleep after dealing with all the constant negative information of  the day. It's silliness is exactly the point!  Wanting to have a chance at a night without too real nightmares, I thought ""what could I watch before bed that would help sweet dreams?"" This was the first and obvious choice!!! Let yourself be open to the simple joy of the experience.  (you don't have to tell anyone if you are concerned about judgment and coolness points.) Ridiculous stereotypes & dialog is all part of the experience along with the  predictable optimistic silver lining that lets us enjoy a big sigh of relief  and a great, refreshing gift of  peaceful sleep!!!!

Yes, some of the stuff is not that funny.  And yes, some of the things in the movie are annoying.  But at the end Clueless is an Entertaining movie.  Now, after watching the movie over again; the ending was quite quick.  There wasn't really a well put out conclusion to it.  Just seemed rushed.  Because of that I gave it here a 4 out of 5 stars.",1396483200,,494,4.126315789473685

In this case it may have been necessary to set up the redemption. I certainly like some of the script's subtleties that carry my expectations for redemption.

Bottom line: I love the main character's intelligence and ability to observe her behavior, and start to change it with different choices. Society can shape us. Some it may control. Don't give in: be who you are. Make the hard choices without it.",1395100800,,533,4.610526315789474

Its a shame that Alicia Silverstone, who is remarkable in this film, didn't make good on the potential she showed with his hilarious performance.  But even with her follies as an actress, shell always have Clueless, and so will we.  This loose adaptation of Jane Austens Emma puts us in the 90s High School system with Cher, a spoiled rich 15 yearold who wants to find love amidst a sea of losers and the occasional Baldwin.

717547,5,6303853102,"Who would have thought that the best screen adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" would emerge from an updated parody set in a Beverly Hills high school and directed by Amy Heckerling? But that's exactly what has happened with this film.

Heckerling obviously gets that Austen's continuous appeal lies in the fact that her stories remain relevant and timely---so why not update it, make the character of Emma (Cher here, played by the adorable Alicia Silverstone) a daffy valley girl, and fill the movie to the brim with pop-culture references and one very funny vignette after another? After all, the spirit and tone of ""Emma"" emerges unscathed.

Comedic performances are always underrated, maybe because they look so easy, but Silverstone really deserves a lot of praise for this movie. It would be nothing without her performance.

On the other hand, there's a certain charm in what is now ""old tech"" and passe fashions and music.

I like this movie because it's funny and shows a complete different American sub-culture that I'm actually not sure exists. The movie is very clean and very funny. I will say although there are political messages in the movie but very subtle. I really don't care to be inundated with political messages when I purchase entertainment (Movies) but unfortunately that's what we have here in America.

717659,4,6303853102,"A teen movie from the mid 90's, Clueless, based on Jane Austen's Emma, is a well-done comedy, and is intelligent without becoming arrogant. Alicia Silverstone, playing the befuddled protagonist role of Cher, is fantastic. We follow her as she makes her way through life, seemingly wanting to be a guardian angel for all of her friends, but somehow mucking things up. She is like a misguided Amelie, trying to make things better, but not quite understanding that many of her attempts, while well-meaning, cause trouble. There is a minor plot twist that the audience knows is coming.

I had never seen this movie as a youngster, and I am proud to say that my friend finally made me view it. It demands multiple views, and is extremely intelligent, although the protagonist is, shall we say, clueless. Look beyond the garish 90's costuming, the parachute pants, saggy mismatched loud clothing the characters wear. This movie holds up, even after 18 years.",1369440000,,952,4.95

Though it is an older movie at this point, it is still relevent and the fashions are so outrageous that they never go out of style (were they ever really IN style?). Since this is a movie about fashion, cliques and growing up, this is important.

The atmosphere is always kept bright and the mood is always light, even in its ""dark"" moments which really don't exist.

 Paul Rudd is excellent as the romantic lead, though his comedic talents are not utilized much in this film.

Alicia Silverstone is the perfect ditz for this role, combining an innocent sexuality with an adorable ""dumb blonde"" persona. Her supporting cast is great too, each being an original personality.

Forget this movie if you want depth and substance, but if you want a few chuckles and a light, fun bit of fluff, buy this, its one of the better ones and you won't be disappointed.

718261,4,6303853102,"Clueless (1995) stars Alicia Silverstone as Cher Horowitz. Like Emma, she is rich and lives with her single father (IIRC, her mother died during plastic surgery, but I may be wrong). Here she is only 15 and already has her own car (before she even has a license!) and spends most of her time with her best friend, Dionne (no book equivalent). The Mr. Knightley character is played by her ex step-brother, Josh, played by Paul Rudd. The movie loosely follows a lot of  Emma`s plotlines. Cher hooks up two of her teachers and from there gets it into her head to be a matchmaker. She decides to give this version's Harriet Smith, new girl Tai (Brittany Murphy), a makeover and to hook her up with Elton. She convinces Tai that her crush, stoner Travis, is no good. Things backfire for her when her matchmaking plans not only fail but Tai eclipses her as the most popular girl. She goes after Christian (Frank Churchill), and although he's not a cad like Frank in the book, he has other reasons for not going for Cher.

Some people think Clueless is the best adaptation of Emma, but I'd have to disagree. I did quite enjoy it and even used to watch the TV spinoff...I was in grade school, okay! I blame this movie for popularizing Valley Girl speak throughout the country, but that's another story.  I really liked the characters of Cher and Josh and their sibling-esque rivalry that blossomed into love and a lot of the parallels with the book were funny, but this isn't one of my favorite movies or even adaptations. I found many of the characters just annoying and not charming at all. I also think this movie treated some inappropriate behaviors too lightly. Maybe I'm just too traditional, but all of the references to sex and pot smoking (Cher disapproves of Travis constantly being stoned but feels no qualms about occasionally smoking a joint at a party) made me a bit uncomfortable. Cher also seemed to think she was the last virgin left at her high school, and tried miserably to seduce Christian. Tai, despite being a ""loser"", oddly has had plenty of sexual experience. The characters were only 15 years old, for Christ's sake! I suppose stuff like this is more realistic (or even not realistic enough!) but part of the reason I watch period films is to escape from reality. I suppose that's why this updated version bothered me a bit.",1304294400,,2342,4.625

718319,5,6303853102,"This lively, sparkling,and comical modern retelling of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" replaces the early 19th century England setting with a late-20th century Beverly Hills setting with grand results.
  The modern L.A. ""Emma Woodhouse"" is named Cher Horowitz(a bubbly and scintillating Alicia Silverstone), the daughter of a wealthy, widowered litigator (Dan Hedaya) whose wife died in ""a fluke accident during a routine liposuction"" when Cher was a baby, who has since remarried and divorced, giving Cher an intellectually and socially conscious ex-stepbrother named Josh(Paul Rudd), who criticizes the 16-year-old princess' lack of depth and drive.
 We see Cher's daily routine where she uses state-of-the-art technology to coordinate her school wardrobe, fusses at her only surviving parent about sticking to the diet his doctor prescribed for him, meets up with her best friend Dionne(Stacey Dash) for a ride to school in the SUV her father got for her even though she doesn't have a drivers' license, and deal with an annoying creep once she arrives at Bronson Alcott High School where she reigns as the Queen Bee.
 One Report Card Day finds Cher at odds over her grades with her teachers, Mr. Hall (the talentedly comedic Wallace Shawn), and Miss Geist(Twink Caplan), who give her the grades she earns based largely on her ineptitude with class assignments. But Cher learned from her father, who argues for a living how to argue her way to top grades, and we learn how skewered certain values of certain upper-class families are when Mel Horowitz praises his daughter for such behavior.
 Others in Cher's crowd include russet-haired Amber Mariens( Elisa Donovan), a ""frienemy"" of Cher and Dionne who competes with the two over popularity, boys, and fashion with a visibly fake personality, Dionne's boyfriend Murray (Donald Faison)with whom Dionne is in a tempestuous relationship,Murray's friend Lawrence (Sean Holland),the skateboarding stoner, Travis( Brecken Meyer), the BMOC, Elton(the charismatic Jeremy Sisto)whose father is a rock concert promoter(reminiscent of the fact that there was a character named Elton in Jane Austen's original story, but here, it is presumed he was named for singer, Elton John),and the Asian American beauty, Summer(Nicole Bilderback).Aida Linares and Julie Brown have comic turns as the Horowitz' maid, Lucy, and Cher's gym teacher, Ms Stoeger. Susan Mohun is Josh's girlfriend, Heather.
  During gym class, a new student named Tai Frasier(the late Brittany Murphy, who hit all the right notes with great comic timing and vulnerability) is introduced, and Cher decides to take the dowdy-looking newcomer--the ""Harriet Smith"" of Jane Austen's story-- under her wing, accompanied by an initially reluctant Dionne.
 Tai is soon well incorporated into Cher's world of make-overs, midriffs and matchmaking, but Josh admonishes Cher for overcompensating for her own motherlessness by ""acting out"" on Tai as if she were her ""Barbie doll"".
 We are exposed to the reckless and dangerous behavior of these upper class kids, watching them smoke pot, attend wild parties in which they destroy and steal property from the house in which they are guests, we see them get drunk, get sick due to their overindulgences,and cutting class in school to go to the mall as a diversion when matchmaker Cher attempts to hook up Elton and Tai, and Tai grieves over Elton's rejection(Remember, Cher still expects her teachers to give her top grades despite all this).After Elton tries to come on to Cher while driving her home after a party in Malibu, her responds to her rebuff by deserting her in a dangerous location where she is mugged and has to call Josh for a ride home.
 As we wander further into this world of teens with bandaged noses due to recent rhinoplasties, a newcomer named Christian Stovitz(Justin Walker), whose divorced parents have joint custody of him, resulting in his alternating semesters between Chicago and Beverly Hills arrives, and Cher feels reason to loosen her self-imposed abstinance from dating High School guys,trying to get Christian to notice her while also trying to find a new boyfriend for Tai.
 On their first date, Josh, who joins Mel's legal team in helping him work on a case
in the dining room of the mansion, also joins Mel in expressing his disapproval of the would-be Rat-Pack Reject. The now-classic ultimatum of a concerned father goes as follows: ""Anything happens to my daughter, I got a .45 and a shovel. I doubt anybody would miss you!""
  But Cher has fun on her night on the dance floor with the Billie Holiday-loving poser. Josh drops by to keep an eye on her and ends up dancing with a humiliated Tai to keep her involved in the social activity.
 After the party ends, Cher reveals her generous side by asking Josh to buy some take-out for those working with her father as they are en route home.
 We also see Cher invite Josh to come stay with her and her father to escape his unhappy home situation when his college campus is closed.
 Her main project throught this story is trying to bring Mr. Hall and Miss Geist together in the hope that romance will make them more indulgent in grading their students, which begins to work.
 But Cher's attempt to seduce Christian while her father is away on business( a topic you can bet Jane Austen never would have mentioned) fizzles, amid the discovery of his sexual orientation, she fails her driving test and cannot negotiate the results of that, and her relationship with Tai takes a raw turn when Tai surpasses her in popularity.
 After an epiphanic moment, Cher realizes she is missing out on her own chance for love, and spurred by Josh's view that she is a brat, decides to become a better person. On one day in particular, Cher and the rest of the school heed Miss Geist's call to get involved in charitable work, sponsoring various causes, and revealing wealthy Beverly Hills High Schoolers at their very best.
 We see the improvement of one acquaintance with obstacles to overcome in his life, which he does with the support of Cher and a reconciled Tai, we see Cher develop into a more caring individual than she already was, and we leave our friends enjoying a glorious wedding day with high hopes for their futures.",1271894400,,6235,5.01257253384913
718320,4,6303853102,"Clueless is a clever teen movie, focusing on ""Cher"" (Alicia Silverstone)  a popular only child, and wealthy 16 year old that is hunting for meaning in life.  She wants to impress her step-brother that she can do more than shop and change make-up and outfits.

Her mother died shortly after she was born due to a bad liposuction job.  She has taken care of her father most of her life, but also is spoiled with all the money she has for clothes, cars, cellular phones and entertainment.

Cher and her best friend Dionne become matchmakers for two lonely teachers.  This is also to benefit them with better grades.  Their latest project is to make a slightly chubby transfer student, Tai, (Brittany Murphy) as popular and stylish as they are.  This is their cause for most of the movie, and it is clever and amusing.

In the end, Cher realizes that she is ""Clueless"" on her feelings for Josh (her step-brother by marriage).  Josh is the anchor of her life and always there for her during many of her matchmaking mistakes and successes.

This is a teen-age classic - quick wit and top notch entertainment.",1268784000,,1102,4.628865979381444
718321,1,6303853102,"I was on a plane to Japan with several business associates when I saw the movie, Clueless.  It had just been released for showing on the airlines at that time.  After the flight, we were all asking if anyone had watched the movie, and we all had done so as a way to pass the time on a long flight.  Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, we all had the same reaction to the movie.  We all agreed that it was the worst movie any of us had ever seen--bar none!

It is a nauseating tale of a spoiled brat in a total unbelievable plot, with abominable acting.  I prefer movies that don't pretend life is anything but the hard, cold struggle for survival that it really is for most of us.  If you're not held captive on a plane with no alternative to watch, you would probably turn Clueless off or change channels after 15 minutes.  Fortunately, most airlines now offer multiple movies on different channels, so you would not get stuck with only Clueless today.  If you have never seen Clueless yet, don't waste precious time that could be put to better use.  Life is too short and precious to waste any of it on this bomb movie.

718390,4,6303853102,Cluless is a story about Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and her friends who together live a fairly empty and meaningless highschool life.  The journey takes a turn when Cher's college age former step-brother comes to stay with Cher and her father and gets Cher to start thinking about more than just herself.  A very humorous coming-of-age comedy where Cher learns about life and love.  Well acted and well written this is a surprisingly funny movie with lots of memorable one liners and scenes.  A somewhat unexpected romance and a cast of well-developed characters make this movie a good choice for those looking for a funny diversion.,1221264000,3,632,4.9904761904761905
718391,4,6303853102,"Cher Horowitz(Alicia Silverstone) is your typical average 15 year old girl. Only of course her father is a rich lawyer, she's gorgeous, spoiled rotten and lives in a Beverly Hills mansion.

Now with that said, this modern day take on Jane Austen's masterpiece Emma obviously falls short of the original and well, our heroine is a bit of an airhead.

BUT although slightly vapid we begin to actually care for these characters and especially Cher, with her attempts at self improvement and love for her family and friends. (She may not be as self-centered as we imagined?)

It's a film you can watch over and over again, and it had yet to become dated!

Paul Rudd also adds a lot to the film as Josh, Cher's adorable ex-stepbrother.

Is it a classic, perhaps not, but it does everything it sets out to and is still tons of fun! And who doesn't love walking around spouting 'As If!'",1220140800,,879,4.573248407643312

Amy Heckerling has a gift for doing movies that are a perfect mix of goofy and witty hilarity.  The casting couldn't have been better, across the board.  Alicia Silverstone manages to brilliantly pull off playing a girl who's naively and irresistibly lovable, despite having been brought up with the kind of privilege which would make most people detestable. This is much more than just your average, teeny-bopper chick-flick; a much wider audience can appreciate the intelligent humor, poking delightful fun at the 90s generation.  I challenge anyone not to crack up during the ""freeway scene""; it's absolutely priceless, thanks in large part to the great comedic skills of Donald Faison.  Paul Rudd is definitely dreamy (just to address the chick-flick aspect!).  Highly recommended to anyone who could use a laugh. :)",1219104000,,994,5.067484662576687
718393,4,6303853102,"I really disliked teen movies.  Didn't like the 1980s Brat Pack movies (including Molly Ringwald's), didn't like the 1990s movies (e.g., ""Never Been Kissed"", ""She's All That"", ""10 Things"").  Sitting through them was torture, so I never bothered with ""Clueless"" at the time it came out, thinking it was of the same ilk.  It so isn't.

""Clueless"" is two steps above the other teen movies.  It doesn't make the mistake of taking high school too seriously as the others do; it pokes endless fun at the genre and teens in general.  At the same time, however, it has an element of affection which the funny parodies of teen films don't have.  It's a perfect combination; Amy Heckerling deserved that WGA nomination.

Alicia Silverstone is hilarious as the well-meaning but clueless Cher, and Heckerling channels the funniest aspects of Austen's Emma to make Cher.  Her well-meaning generosity is coupled with just a little shallowness.  Heckerling also does a fantastic job of making Cher at once countercultural but even cooler because of it.  Her rant about boys who wear pants eighty sizes too big is great, and she manages to deliver an anti-drug message without being preachy.  Unlike recent movies like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Juno"", Heckerling, with earnest humor, has Cher make virginity cool - ""You see how picky I am about my shoes and they only go on my feet.""  I don't know how Heckerling pulled it off, but she does.

Paul Rudd is adorable as the George Knightley (Josh) falling for Cher, and Brittany Snow and Breckin Meyer make the dopey Tai and skater Travis a fantastic pair.  Elisa Donovan's catty Amber, who manages to land Elton, is fantastic.

My favorites after Silverstone are Stacey Dash and Donald Faison as Dionne and Murray and Dan Hedaya as Cher's father.  Dash and Faison are so hilarious on screen together; Murray's head shaving and their exchange about ""woman"" and ""Miz Dionne"" are laugh-out-loud good.  Dan Hedaya delivers on Hecklering's script; his comment to Christian (""I've got a .45 and a shovel.  I doubt anyone would miss you"") is delivered with all the grumpiness of Austen's Mr. Woodhouse.

Again, though, the genius of this movie lies in Heckerling's script.  She makes a surprisingly close rendition of ""Emma"", despite the radically different setting, and manages to infuse it with both some of Austen's amusing look at the characters as well as modern humor.  (Dionne's hats are a riot.)  Very fun.",1218758400,2,2432,4.935960591133005
718394,5,6303853102,"Great movie; Brings me back to when I was like 13.  Some of the jokes already seem a bit dated, but this is Alicia Silverstone at her peak. Not a very deep movie, but it's cute nonetheless.",1217980800,,189,4.108108108108108
718395,3,6303853102,"When I first saw this movie, I was 12. Of course, at the time I loved the movie. I thought that Alicia Silverstone was such an interesting actress and I liked how the movie included ""real life"" from a kid's perspective. Keep in mind, at the age of 12 my brain was not fully developed. I do not know how any adult can sit still long enough to watch the opening credits of this movie. It is absolutely nauseating and ridiculous from beginning to end. Frankly, I am also very offended by the scenes of the kids using and abusing recreational drugs at that party. I don't care if it's just a movie and I don't care if you think I am a prude, drugs are disgusting and should never be glamorized to children. I'm sorry that's just the way I feel. The only person I enjoyed in this movie was Julie Brown as the gym teacher, Ms. Stoeger. She was a hard pill to swallow but also a very clever supporting character, who I barely recognized. What this movie does not tell the viewer is that money and status and clothing and material possessions do not make you a better person. As a kid watching this I never knew that and I thought that Cher was such a lucky child to have everything that she did. As an adult, I see how sad and tragic and out-of-control her life really was. If you want to see a realistic presentation of teen life as it was and is and should be then I recommend getting any of the first 4 seasons of 90210. BTW, the actress who played Dionne, Stacey Dash is in her 40's! I'm not very surprised because she looked like she was pushing 28 or 29. Talk about being miscast. Can someone please tell Bravo to stop showing this smack every few days? Is their programming dept. really that un-creative and lazy?

It's true, of course, that the drug and sex elements would have no place in Austen's world, but the essential cluelessness of the initially snobbish, smarty-pants heroine has been retained, which clarifies why Austen thought the Emma character overall a heroine nobody except the author herself ""would much like."" Retained, too, is the heroine's essential innocence, which turns out to be her saving grace.

What Heckerling also refuses to derail - and this is most important - is the persistent ironic wit which distinguishes the novel. Other versions of recent years fall victim to beautiful period costumes and become just relatively humorless, prettily photographed, largely empty Regency romances. ""Clueless"" retains the satiric bite which led one critic to call Austen's style not genial but distinguished instead by a ""regulated hatred"" directed against deficiencies in sense or generous feeling.",1196553600,,1112,5.427745664739884

Alicia Silverstone's portrayal of Cher is priceless and so is the script. A not to be missed entry in the teen romance/comedy movie genre.

718561,5,6303853102,"`Clueless' is probably the equivalent of `The Breakfast Club' for the 90's generation.  I went to school with these kids; sadly...I was one of these kids.  `Clueless' is also one of the smartest comedies to come out in the 90's for it capitalized on everything that made teenagers of that era funny and stupid.  The 90's was a much easier time.  Now we have films like `thirteen' (probably the best film to come out in 2003) to describe life as a teenager...life today is just so much darker than I remember it growing up.

So `Clueless' is a modern adaptation of Jane Austen's novel `Emma' and it revolves around Cher (Silverstone) who is popular and pretty and completely self centered and spoiled.  She hangs out with the equally spoiled (and equally rich) Dionna (Dash) and Amber (Donovan).  When Cher's step brother Josh (Rudd) comes to stay with her and her father she tries to convince him that she's not the spoiled selfish brat he accuses her of being.  In an attempt to do this she decides to help ease the new girl Tai (Murphy) into popularity by giving her a makeover and hooking her up with popular boy Elton (Sisto).

What makes this movie so enjoyable is the innocent charm Silverstone oozes all over the screen.  She is a complete star here...so much so that it shock and upsets me that after this film she just disappeared.  In fact the only actor in this film that actually moved on the stardom was Brittany Murphy, and she was the one I least expected (well not least, but she was more like number four on my list of assumed breakouts).  Funny and witty and perfectly cast, `Clueless' is sure to entertain all who watch it no matter what year it is.  Sure, if you grew up in the 90's it'll help.  I'm sure that my kids will feel about `Clueless' the same way I feel about `The Breakfast Club' but like I always say...""to each his own.""",1159488000,,1854,4.495522388059701
718562,5,6303853102,"Clueless is a thoroughly delightful film, this edition improves on it with excellent bonus features - all are good, but Fashion 101 is not to be missed.

Despite its glossy veneer - a world populated by attractive, narcissistic, and privileged kids - Clueless is a smart, droll, endearing look inside youth culture.  Because it touches on universal themes, fully operational when Jane Austen wrote Emma, the film withstands the test of time despite language (as if) and fashion trends (droopy drawers for skaters) that, as fads, have the average life span of a drosophila.

Many viewers will approach Clueless with a certain amount of hostility.  Cher, the protagonist, played to perfection by Alicia Silverstone, is impossibly beautiful.  Worse still, her father, a gruff but charmingly protective Dan Hedaya, is beyond rich.  Even worse, Cher seems to live entirely on the surface of things, expressing her creativity through social meddling and wardrobe.  (The outfits worn by Cher, her friend Dionne, and others in their inner circle are reason enough to watch the film.)  How could we ever like such wretched, spoiled kids?

Because, Clueless is a beautifully executed, gentle satire, not a broad farce or biting indictment.  Writer/Director Amy Heckerling, (who also did Fast Times At Ridgemont High - a lesser endeavor), understands and loves her characters, they are not stereotypes.  We like these kids because they are in on the joke, they know they're hothouse orchids.  Blatant examples include Murray, played by Donald Faison (now on Scrubs) a black uber-yuppie who learns his street patois from MTV, and Jeremy Sisto's Elton who has apparently hobbled his identity together from Rat Pack press photos.

With the stage beautifully set, a comedy of manners begins, Cher manipulates people in order to serve her idea of the greater social good and learns a few lessons along the way.  No one is shot.  No helicopters appear.  Inept driving is featured, but there are no car chases.  Wonder of wonders, especially for a teen movie, there is no gratuitous sex.  Amy Heckerling is to be saluted for creating a film that relies on story, dialogue, detail, character, and acting to do the work.  Her success is complete.  Clueless uses SoCal youth culture as its milieu, not its point.  Really a pleasure and worth owning.",1155081600,3,2328,5.089709762532982

Cher is obsessed with clothes, boys, and finding the right pair of shoes for her picky feet.

Even eventually realizing happiness for herself is possible while caring for and helping others. An amazingly well done and realistic portrayal of a touchingly practical idealist including the struggles of being truly good to others and selfless while not neglecting oneself, nor falling to selfishness.

I already owned this movie on VHS, but a movie like this is worth having in your DVD collection. Of course, the quality on DVD is better than VHS, but it's even better because it's ""anamorphic"" -- excellent quality than some ordinary, standard widescreen movie (because of that, this movie looks recently made than a 1995 movie). Moreover it has superb audio Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound! If you have 5.1 speakers, the scene with Dionne (Cher's best friend) accidently getting on the freeway is where the surround sound truly enhances the experience: you can hear all the cars and bikes driving by just as if you were in the car with Dionne, Cher, and Murray. (Speaking of which, that's one of my favorite scenes! It really did an excellent job capturing the fear of getting on the freeway. I mean, it's not too far-fetched; it could really happen with all the crazy drivers in LA! The truck, the bikers, the old lady giving the middle finger... hilarious. Anyhow...)

I'm glad they gave this DVD a makeover instead of leaving with some instant VHS-DVD transfer with only a movie trailer. On this new edition, they have really enjoyable special features too.

""The Class of '95 - A look at the cast, then and now"" (about 18 minutes long):
- It's really cool being able to see how the cast looks like now! Christian (the gay guy) seemed like he gained some weight. Josh looked like he aged; he looked different, maybe because of the lighting or makeup off the set. Oh, in the DVD, it mentioned Dionne was 28 (that old?!) at the time when she did the movie! To me, she still looked young in the interviews. What was truly disappointing, though, was how Alicia, the main star of the movie, was not in the present interview! However, there is footage of her getting interviewed back in '95. I was also disappointed how there was absolutely no commentary! Having commentary for a DVD, especially if they say interesting things in it, is actually something I enjoy having. Those two reasons are pretty much why I'm giving this DVD a 4 star. Also, the main menu has a video background, which is nice, but the chapter selection are just plain stills. Anyway, continuing on with the other special features...

""Creative Writing"" (about 10 minutes long)
- how the movie got started.

""Fashion 101"" (about 11 minutes long)
- shows the fashion in the movie. It's so funny how this movie made fun of the baggy pants (which pretty much died now).

""Language Arts"" (about 8 minutes long)
- explains the vocabulary used on Clueless (eg: ""betty"" meant an attractive female.)

""Suck 'N Blow: A Tutorial"" (about 3 minutes long)
- pretty much shows how difficult that game was because the card was too heavy to suck for the actors.

""Driver's Ed"" (about 4 minutes long)
- talks about the Dionne freeway scene.

""We're History""(about 9 minutes long)
- pretty much the final thoughts from the cast.

-----------------------------------------------------
They couldn't have found a better cast; Alicia as Cher was perfect and the rest are really likable too (well, except for Elton -- the movie did a good job making me hate him. And Brittany Murphy was also my second least favorite character (she really got the bitchy attitude down calling Cher ""A virgin who can't drive."")

There's no dull moment in the movie at all. It's smooth transition throughout the movie. So many funny scenes (eg: Cher taking her driving test). The mood, cinematography, the soundtrack is all great. Believe it or not, I am a guy (straight) and I'm not ashamed to say ""Clueless"" is one of my favorite movies. Alicia really made the ""blonde girl"" look good!

If you enjoyed this movie, I would also recommend ""Never Been Kissed"" starring Drew Barrymore. Apparently, the costume designer for ""Never Been Kissed"" was the same from this movie.",1141689600,4,4089,4.836909871244635
718647,4,6303853102,This is one of those movies that you can watch anytime and still find yourself smiling. It is also interesting to note the effect on culture that the movie had at the time. The special edition has some interesting features as well.,1141084800,,231,4.523809523809524
718648,5,6303853102,"I loved this modern remake of Jane Austin's Emma.  Clueless follows the life of protagonist Cher, who feels that she can control / change anything she wants.  This starts with her wanting to raise her grade in debate, so she decides to set up two of her teachers that she thinks could make a love connection.  After her first plan works, Cher trys to help more people.  Her second conquest is Tai, a skater chick, who she turns into her mini me.  When trying to play matchmaker for Tai, nothing goes according to plan, including Cher finding someone for herself.  I definatly recommend this movie.  If you liked this, I would also recommend watching Emma ( with Gwenyth Paltrow).",1139702400,,679,4.65546218487395
718649,4,6303853102,"Clueless has been released on DVD before, with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features. In 2005, for its 10th anniversary, Paramount finally released a great, if not cheesily named, DVD edition of this 90's teen comedy classic, with such quotable lines as ""You're a virgin who can't drive"" and ""As if!""

The transfer on this DVD is AWESOME. It's very clean, sharp, and clear. I don't remember any issues on the past DVD, but if there were any, it seems like they were cleared up for this release.

The bonus features are likeable fluff, but at least they're existent. Featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members, such featurettes as ""The Class of '95,"" which discusses the cast, and ""Language Arts,"" which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon, allow us to delve, if only just slightly, into the making and the impact of this movie. Also, the trailers from the previous DVD release are included.

Children of the 90's definitely need to own this DVD. Clueless is still a major part of America's pop culture today, and really, who doesn't love watching a 90's teen comedy remake of a literary classic like Jane Austen's Emma?",1138579200,,1200,4.815533980582524
718650,1,6303853102,"This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new ""teen speak"" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out.",1137110400,7,1168,4.387096774193548
718651,4,6303853102,"This movie rocks.  You know that.  I know that.  The important part of this review is the new Special Edition DVD.  After the lame bare-bones first release, ""Clueless"" fans were owed something definitive, and instead we get this!

The packaging is glossy and pretty, and there are a lot of featurettes that are a lot of fun.  Seeing the cast then and now is really a treat -- in SPITE of the fact that Silverstone declined to participate.  I don't know why she's chosen to distance herself from this movie, because it's the best one that she's ever been in and no one's going to forget that she did it, no matter what else she does.  But whatEVER.  (By the way -- the most interesting tidbit in the extras is that Alicia didn't mispronounce ""Hatians"" on purpose, for the character.  She herself actually didn't know how to pronounce the word!)

Anyways, the reason I have to take off a star (I should really take off two, but I like the movie too much to do that.) is beause of everything we're NOT given:

1) There are NO DELETED SCENES!!!  Come ON, Paramount!  What were you THINKING!  We KNOW there are deleted scenes beause we can see them in the trailers.  We know there are deleted scenes because we saw the movie in theaters and we remember the original cut.  And yet we get bupkis.
2) Even more frustrating is the fact that in the featurettes, Amy Heckerling mentions that EVERYONE except Silverstone auditioned via videotape. . . . . . . SO WHERE ARE THE TAPES???  You can't just mention something that juicy and then not include it!!!  Grrrrrr.
3) And to top it all off, there's NO COMMENTARY.  Not from Heckerling, not from any cast members, not from the producers -- nada.  Hell, I'd even listen to the Key Grip and Best Boy do a commentary -- I just want to learn more about this movie!!  I mean come on, it's not like any of these people are A-list actors with so much on their plates!  They could have spent two hours recording a damn commentary.  I want on-set anecdotes!  I want hidden tidbits!  This is one of very few movies whose commentary I was looking forward to, and I am VERY sorry to see that it doesn't exist.
4) There are a bunch of freakin' PREVIEWS at the beginning of the movie that you can't skip past by hitting the menu button; you have to sit there and fast forward.  I can't think of anything lamer.

Overall, the missing pieces are a bitter disappointment, but I'm not sorry I bought the DVD because it's an essential piece for the collection.",1134086400,7,2480,4.426991150442478
718652,4,6303853102,"Recently a lot of DVDs that were released back when DVDs were first introduced on the market are coming out with new editions. This is good news since those early releases came with little in the way of special features. It seems the studios just didn't think about bounus material then.

But now, I guess because those features have become so popular, they've decided rerelease many of those films on DVD.

So in addition to this witty comedy, you get an inside look at what went into the making of it ten years after it's release. Though Alicia Silvertone is missing from the new bounus material (except for onset interview footage from 1995), I found writer/director Amy Heckerlings interview footage insightful in particular.",1129161600,2,729,4.91869918699187

718655,3,6303853102,"I was so excited when I picked up this DVD for dead cheap. I've had it on my wishlist for ages (although I recently swapped it for the special edition, which doesn't look that ""special""), but everytime I've looked it up online, it's been quite expensive.

I was very disappointed. This movie is so 1990s, it's almost embarrassing! I remember the 90s (about the only decade I do remember), and I also remember all the ""whatevers"" and ""losers"" COMPLETE with hand movements! No one would do that in public anymore! Eeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwww! And the fashion as well - oh my god, did we actually wear that stuff! And it was only 10 years ago as well!

Hollywood & various other American TV shows portrayed American high schools really badly. It comes across as being very unrealistic most of the time. I didn't really watch Beverley Hills 90210 while I was growing up - I grew up with British TV shows, but also Clarissa Explains It All & Sabrina The Teenage Witch. I think with this film, if you originally saw it in the 90s, you'll LOVE it, as obviously most of the reviewers here do. Viewing it in 2005, shows it in a whole different light. An embarrassing light.

All the characters are horribly OTT (and most you'll recognise from other teen movies/TV shows), Alicia Silverstone & Brittany Murphy being the worst offenders. Stacey Dash actually comes across as a natural. How awful did Brittany Murphy look?! Good lord, she's virtually unrecognisable, and not in a good way either. And Alicia really started to get on my nerves, with the constant hair tossing. Tie your hair back, or get it cut! And it was so glaringly obvious that Cher's love interest at one point was very much G.A.Y. How many more obvious references could she have been blind to? Of course, they're all very stereotypical references - the fashion sense, the films (Some Like It Hot deals with cross-dressing men and Spartacus includes the famous scene where a Roman master tries to seduce his male servant.) Isn't it strange how you totally don't notice these things when you're young? This reference went straight over my head when I saw it in high school in History. But I was most likely asleep.

I just don't know what I'm missing about this movie, but I'm definitely glad I didn't fork out all the money for the ""Whatever"" special edition. This is totally cringeworthy, and embarrassing.",1127692800,3,2361,4.723300970873787
718656,4,6303853102,"""Clueless"" looks smarter and smarter as the years go by. Amy Heckerling's delightfully cynical tale of worldly teens obsessed with designer clothes, utility vehicles and cell phones still rings true, down to the last fashionista.

The new ""Whatever!"" edition on DVD is aptly named: The slanguage Heckerling invented for her Beverly Hills High kids survives a decade later, proving every bit as seminal as the pioneering work of Moon Unit Zappa.

""Clueless,"" of course, was in the makeover business long before reality TV stormed popular culture. Heckerling's heroines delight in transforming a grunge-clad transfer student into a hot property. Reality stuck to the script as the chubby young actress, Brittany Murphy, eventually brushed past ""Clueless"" stunner Alicia Silverstone to become Hollywood's It Girl.

Paramount doesn't shout about Murphy's supporting role in its marketing for the ""Clueless"" DVD. In the extra features, she just turns up as one of the gang paying tribute to Heckerling's film -- and the director's prescience. Silverstone, who won hearts and minds playing 90210 princess Cher, is the sole holdout, an absence that goes unexplained (and unpunished) in the extras.

Despite the acclaim and affection for this loose update of Jane Austen's ""Emma,"" ""Clueless"" was always in need of a home-video makeover, dating back to the laserdisc days. The new single-disc edition replaces Par's bare-bones DVD release of 2003, which basically came without extras. There are minor improvements in the decent video and audio, and something was done about the so-last-century cover art.

True to the film's spirit, six snappy new featurettes survey the ""Clueless"" phenomenon. ""We're History"" explores the pop-culture legacy; ""Creative Writing"" tells of Heckerling's trials in creating and selling the movie; ""Fashion 101"" dissects the vines; and so on. A cute bit shows how to play the movie's (PG-rated) ""suck and blow"" game.

There are no deleted scenes and no commentary, unfortunately, but the featurette interviews with writer-director Heckerling and cinematographer Bill Pope (""The Matrix"") give fans a pretty good idea of what was what.",1126137600,,2152,5.466867469879518

It really brought back memories because I was 13 years old when this movie was originally released. The special features aren't bad. I got a kick out of watching the shorts on the clothes, the language, the Suck and Blow tutorial. Ha ha!

Definitely buy this movie. It's great for a laugh and a teenage girl could appreciate it!",1126137600,,480,4.393258426966292
718731,5,6303853102,"This new special edition is a definite improvement over the previous incarnation that had no real extras to speak of and so for fans of this movie it is definitely worth the double-dip. Watching these new extras is like revisiting the cast ten years later to see what they've been up to. They are done in the style of and maintain the same tone of the movie which is a nice touch.

""The Class of `95"" examines how the film was cast. Heckerling talks about how she picked the actors. The main cast members, except for Silverstone and Jeremy Sisto, are all back to talk about how their involvement.

""Creative Writing"" takes a look at the film's origins. The studio originally wanted Heckerling to write a TV show about an in-crowd group of teens but they didn't get it so she changed it into a movie.

""Fashion 101"" examines the memorable costumes from the movie. What Cher and her friends wore reflected the personality of each character and ended up influencing what kids subsequently wore.

""Language Arts"" is a crash course on the film's colourful slang. Heckerling had collected books and lists of slang over the years and incorporated it into the movie so that each character had their own way of speaking and favourite sayings that are now quoted endlessly by its fans.

""Suck `n Blow: A Tutorial"" explains the party game that takes place in the film in an amusing featurette done during the production.

The challenge of shooting Dionne's driving lesson on the Los Angeles freeway is explored in ""Driver's Ed."" It was a logistical nightmare with all kinds of vehicles coming at the actors so that their scared reactions were genuine!

""We're History"" features the cast and crew talking about what they think about the film ten years later. Not surprisingly, they are all proud of its legacy and how well it's aged.

718732,4,6303853102,"Ten years after its initial release, CLUELESS maintains its charm in its honest depiction of teen angst during the mid-nineties.  Alicia Silverstone is radiantly impressive as Cher, a soon to be 16 year old whose main focus in life seems to be her clothing and her matchmaking skills.  Silverstone never comes across as truly obnoxious, though, and she seems to really be in to the mechanisms that went into making a cell-phone oriented teen.  Stacey Dash and Brittany Murphy are perfect as her comrades, and Paul Rudd is handsome and charming as Cher's step brother.  A strong supporting cast of adults including Dan Hedaya, Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplin are also good in their ""older folks"" roles.  Although CLUELESS is rarely plot-driven, it is merely an examination of a whole new class of youngsters, and it is Silverstone's performance that anchors the film and supplies the impetus for an overall entertaining romp.",1125964800,,923,5.046052631578948
718733,4,6303853102,"The first time I got the opportunity to see Clueless in 1995 it offered a highly satirical perspective of Jane Austen's Emma where dimness and immaturity framed the world of a spoiled teenage existence in the Beverly Hills.  The second time around with this film I received a more authentic impression that brought to mind the high school students from the MTV's reality show Laguna Beach.  Amy Heckerling displays her cinematic agility to incorporate classic literature with a contemporary real world perspective of spoiled brats into a light of satirical comedy and coming of age drama.

For many teenagers life in high school is an intolerable experience due to constant popularity contests, peer rejection, peer pressure, and the ability of teens to project others perception on self, which often is negative.  On this bridge into adulthood many teens find themselves perplexed about their identity and existence, which is often worsened due to their unawareness of the world and self.  In the confusion of identity crisis and popularity contests many loose themselves and the ability to reassure themselves in their own ability to conceptualize.  Clueless enhances this moment from the perspective of the most popular girl, Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) through her extensive cerebral monologues.  These thoughts provide amusement and irony for the audience through self-reflective contemplation and understanding for how many teens might experience adolescence.

With the help of a credit card Cher can afford the best and priciest designer outfits and accessories due to her father Mel (Dan Hedaya), a widowed high paid lawyer that only knows how to raise Cher by spoiling her.  Her social life surrounds shopping and hanging out with her friends at school, which is a heavy-duty job, as she must maintain her status at all times.  Through her popularity she has befriended Dionne (Stacey Dash), and as Cher puts it, ""She's my friend because we both know what it is to have people be jealous of us.""  Here Heckerling offers a notion of how the social hierarchy is created in high schools and other situations where teens accumulate.

The vanity and narcissism might feel blown up out of proportion, but after having viewed an episode of Laguna Beach it feels a little more authentic.  Cher's reality perspective is extremely skewed, which brings to mind absent-mindedness and ignorance of the surrounding world.  For example, Cher does not have a driving license, but drives anyway.  When it comes to parking she simply says with convincing belief, ""Why learn to park when every place you go has a valet?""  What makes this extra amusing is Cher's eloquence and verbal dexterity, as the hollow content actually sounds good.  It brings to mind some of the legendary statements made by the French Royal Court in the time right before the French Revolution.  Yet, the audience cannot help to feel sorry for Cher when she finds herself in superficial predicaments, as her existence has been formed by a loving and overly providing father.

Some of the struggles that Cher has to face include how to raise her C-minus grade point average to the project of helping a new student, Tai (Brittany Murphy), to fit into her social grouping.  She also falls in love with a new guy at school, and begins to discuss sex with her friends.  These and many other issues converge in the story of Cher who finds herself struggling with her own identity and existence while coming of age.  It is not unlike many teens in the world, but it is a unique story told out of Cher's viewpoint.  Heckerling cleverly depicts the importance of nurture, as Cher drifts into the final phase of adolescence and finally crosses the bridge into adulthood in a thoughtfully amusing tale of finding oneself.",1125878400,3,3781,5.033707865168539

My mom adored it because it was cute, quirky, and made fun of itself.  My younger brother thought it was stupidly funny and enjoyable.  Today, I still like it because it captures everything I used to love about the 1990's, and I can laugh at all the things I used to think were so cool.

For Jane Austen purists, this is probably not the movie for you, although I must say that I don't think there's anything wrong with giving a classic tale a makeover and sending it off to the masses.",1125273600,,656,4.216
718736,5,6303853102,"`Clueless' is one of my all time favorite movies. It is fun, romantic, unique, and pleases audience of all ages.

I'm not going to spill the storyline too much because I see there are many other reviewers who have mentioned it. In shot, Alicia Silverstone plays Cher Horowitz, a rich-classy teenager, who after initially doing a good deed to get a good grade, starts doing other deeds for fun, realizing that she is more `clueless' than everyone else, and has to find out what she really wants.

I love this movie and watch it at least once or twice a year. Alicia Silverstone became an instant hit after her role as Cher Horowitz. I cannot pick out just one person who stands out because the entire cast acted so well! Director Amy Heckerling strikes up the right chords for this movie as she did for `Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. I was disappointed with the DVD Paramount had released years ago, because it had no special features in it, except the teaser and theatrical trailer. Now that the `Whatever!' edition of this movie is releasing, I am glad that we will be able to watch some featurettes on the cast and crew of this movie.

I'm glad that this movie is being re-released with a better edition, which it deserves. I just hope that Paramount somehow releases the series that aired on TV after the movie came out, because that is equally funny and charming like the movie.",1123372800,3,1383,4.568548387096774

Alicia Silverstone was perfectly cast as the spoiled but lovable Cher. She created a character that is potentially despicable but because Silverstone played it well, the character came off appealing and sympathetic.

Visually engaging, amusing performances particularly by Silverstone, a witty and funny screenplay, playful and energetic direction by Heckerling and a really appealing story. You can't go wrong with this film.

718815,5,6303853102,"I was thirteen when ""Clueless"" was released in 1995, and was definitely part of the target audience director Amy Heckerling wanted to reach.  This was the ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" for the 1990s (which, incidentally, Heckerling also directed back in the early 1980s).

Included in this film, were the cultural and generational trappings of adolescence (obsession with physical attraction, wearing the right brand names, having the right friends, etc.) that continue into post-adolescence and sometimes haunt us years after we graduate from high school and start a new chapter in life.  It is also very funny, which is a plus.  Though, much of the Southern California lingo is, perhaps, terribly dated--though, I could be mistaken, of course.  (e.g. ""Whatever,""  ""He is such a Baldwin,"" ""He's a friend of Dorothy"")  This is a whimsical look at the life of fifteen year old Cher Horowitz (played by the petulant, whining and very convincing Alicia Silverstone), a poor little rich girl with so much money she doesn't know what do with herself.  So, she spends the bulk of her allowance on clothes, accessories and more clothes!  I mean, this girl has enough clothes to start her own fashion boutique on Rodeo Drive!  In order for her to properly accessorize her ensembles, she relies on a special computer program that matches her outfits together for her.  Her best friend, Dionne (Stacey Dash), is also a poor little rich girl.  The reason they have bonded is, because, in the words of Cher, ""We were both named after famous people who now do infomercials.  And, we both know what it feels like for people to be jealous of us.""  Together, these two young women give us a glimpse into the life of extravagantly rich, incredibly spoiled teenage drama queens and how money can't buy you everything.

""Clueless"" was actually based on ""Emma,"" the classic novel written by Jane Austen.  Though, Victorian England has been updated to Southern California in the mid-1990s and the horsedrawn carriages have been replaced with Jeeps and flashy sportscars, the message about finding your own happiness through becoming less elitist and more thoughtful still rings true.

This movie tells the story of Cher, a sixteen year old girl from Beverly Hills, played by Alicia Silverstone. Her big dilemmas in life are if she can go shopping and how to argue her way through anything as her litigator father has taught her. This is movie is hilarious and is really easy to follow. You'll get caught up in the turmoils of Cher's difficult life living with her widowed father, dealing with her obnoxious step brother Josh, and trying to play matchmaker for her friends at school. Then the guy who her friend likes begins to like her instead. Her world starts to crumble when she realizes that she needs to find love for herself, not just for others.

 This movie is a favorite among teenage girls. Even parents may find this movie funny. I really liked all of Cher's witty comments and I liked the story line of her setting up her friends with guys but never finding lover for herself. In the end, love is right under her nose in the place she least expected to look for it.

 Many teenage girls like this movie. The majority of the girls who have seen this movie probably do not have nearly as much money aw she has or things her disposal by her maid and her dad. Despite this, you can still relate to Cher and her difficulties. What teenage girl can say she's never have problems with boys or deciding what to wear in her lifetime?

 Many girls can relate to this aspect of the movie. Most people can probably not relate to Cher's Hollywood life, with her expensive house (""My house is classic, the columns date all the way back to 1972!"") and her high flying lifestyle. But no one can help falling in love with her personality. I liked this movie mainly because of Cher's character. She can seem like a spoiled brat at times, but once you get to see her in the movie, you can see she is a really funny, entertaining girl.

All of her problems, such as what outfit to wear, sound like they would be annoying, but they really are quite humorous. Plus, she's easy to relate to. She seems like the kinds of girl that if you were having problems, she'd be there to talk to you and make you feel better. She is easy to relate to, and as I mentioned above, almost every girl can relate to some aspect of her life. Whether its not having the right shoes, or having the boys you like fall in love with one of your friends. Cher makes all her dilemmas comical however.

 This movie can be enjoyed by many ages and types of people. It's basically poking fun of spoiled kids from Beverly Hills. Cher's main goal in life is to make other people happy, which she tries while setting up her friends and doing things for other people. Her own personal live could use a little something, but she tries not to worry about it.

 This movie is somewhat of a chick flick, but it is enjoyed by all. A lot of guys have seen it and have no problem admitting it- it's a good movie! This is a classic movie, a must see, which everyone has to watch at least once in their life time. The average day in the life of Cher is nothing like that of a really ""average"" teenage girl, however this movie is hilarious and hits all the right spots with it's audience, promising a good time for all.",1096416000,,3294,4.313915857605178

Yes, Clueless is a light, and fluffy film, but since that is what it sets out to do(be light and fluffy and entertaining),thats just fine. And it accomplishes that goal perfectly-Clueless is a film second to none in its genre.
What sets it apart from other dumb tripe out there and makes it enjoyable for even the most weary of grown-ups is its great cast, unbelievably witty writing, and irresistable storylines that you can't help but get caught up in. The whole cast is great, but Alicia Silverstone is unforgettable. It is a pinnacle leading role for actresses in teen movies. She simply sparkles from scene one. An who could ever forget the sets and costumes??
Simply, a classic in the genre, and one of the best comedies of the nineties. A weekend popcorn movie to curl up in bed with that also has wit and charisma and intelligence to boot. Not to mention, its still not old after the fifth billion time.",1085616000,8,1225,4.675925925925926

Tai represents the woman who goes unnoticed, who does not reflect the feminine woman that Cher is, until Cher makes Tai a commodity; objectifying her for all men to see and allowing her to be surveyed.

The DVD being an early release in the DVD market has few extras, only the theatrical trailer and a tv spot. But overall, I was just happy to have it.

718859,5,6303853102,"So what is the most influential film of the '90s?  A good case could be made for ""Clueless"", a movie that does as much to encapsulate the age of Britney-era M-TV as, well, ""Pulp Fiction"" encapsulated the culture of 'ironic', grunge-era M-TV. Or you could compare it with the Heckerling-directed but Crowe-scripted ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" as a study in contrasts.  ""Clueless"" is surely Heckerling's own darling child, a triumph of writing and direction that is obviously derived from Jane Austen's ""Emma"" without being derivative in any bad sense of the word.  Shot in sassy, lollipop colors by Dick Pope, the film exudes an impossible sense of cheer as it navigates the social misfortunes and triumphs of our giddy heroine, Cher, played by Alicia Silverstone with a comic oomph that ensures her a place in film history regardless of how many flops she suffered since.  For all of its of-the-moment trendiness (and though I realize the film is, as a certain demographic judges these things, ""old"" already, I have to give it snaps for maintaining its youthful feel) ""Clueless"" feels like some classic comedy of the '30s or '40s powdered up with Calvin Klein outfits and a pop soundtrack.  It treats its sexual and social themes gently, with a classiness that hasn't been matched by even the best subsequent teen comedies.  That's significant considering almost every teen comedy since has benefited from the format ""Clueless"" laid out.  Its sweetly satiric tone, jazzy pace, and vivid colors can be seen in films as diverse as ""Legally Blonde"", ""Josie and the Pussycats"", and ""Bring It On"".  Even neo-teen raunch flicks like ""American Pie"" probably owe their comparative sensitivity to ""Clueless"".  It proved that the teen demographic would appreciate a film with style.  The script, direction, performances, etc. all provide style in abundance.  In the teen comedy genre, ""Clueless"" stands proud as its ""Citizen Kane"".",1062979200,4,1924,5.115015974440895

718926,5,6303853102,"Why is it the best teen movie of all time? Because it was hip, and it was smart. There was no gross-out humor or slapstick comedy. It was a big movie with a big heart. It's really hard not to fall in love with this movie.
Loosely based on Jane Austen's ""Emma"" (LOOSELY), ""Clueless"" revolves around a ditzy rich girl name Cher, whose life consists mostly of cell phones, trips to the mall, a killer wardrobe, and tons of guys drooling over her. Her best friend is Dionne, who is just as superficial as Cher. One day, a new girl, Ty, comes to school and inspires a project for Cher. Project: Makeover! What begins as a selfish way to make Cher think she's doing something to help mankind, turns into a really sweet, funny film.
Alicia Silverstone is wonderful in this movie, and sadly has not found any good roles since. A shame, since she is genuinly a great actress. This is also where Brittany Murphy got her big start, as the girl in desperate need of a makeover. And who didn't have a crush on Paul Rudd, who played her ""annoying"" older ex-stepbrother?
If you haven't seen this film yet, then, well, I'm wondering why. It was at one point my favorite movie, and it's still high up on my list. It's charming, sweet, funny, and smart. If only other teen movies could take notes from this one. Then we wouldn't have to sit through these ridiculous ones they keep putting out all the time (""American Pie"" springs to mind...).",1045008000,39,1424,4.459770114942529
718927,5,6303853102,"I loved this movie 100%.  It was funny, creative, romantic, and hit home.  The story depicts the rich girl, Cher (Alicia Silverstone), who lives a rather easy life at high school with her best friend, Dion (I don't know her name).  The story and setting gets explained within the first half hour.  Cher's mother is dead, she's had at least one stepmother who has divorced her father.  Her father is a litigator (which I spelled wrong) which is ""one of the scariest kinds of lawyers"".  She has a stepbrother, Josh (Paul Rudd, with whom I am totally in love), who hangs out around the house all the time, much to her dislike since they never get along, and their mother and father have already divorced.  Cher is the type of girl who shops ""to regain strength"" and argues her way out of bad grades.  T
he story swings into action when she tries to make her debate teacher fall in love with another teacher, so her life might be easier (if they fall in love maybe they won't be so harsh with grades, etc.).  She decides she wants to do more ""good deeds"" after making her teachers fall in love (she also wants to impress her stepbrother, since she's insulted by his saying that she never does anything that isn't selfish), so she picks up the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy).  The story is thrown headlong into love interests, boyfriends, match-making, and mistakes.  There are only a few downsides to this movie.  There is drug use and sex (though the sex is only hinted at) but both are put in a rather kind light, as if everyone does drugs.  But they do attempt to make a distinqush between being buzzed at a party and being ""fried all day"".  Neither are explicit, and they don't take from this light-hearted movie, but be prepared if you are offended by those kinds of things.
I think you'll be surprised by this kindhearted, well-meaning movie.  It is amusing, and Cher turns out to be more than a shallow, superficial airhead and, again, Paul Rudd is way cute.
P.S. for those of you have seen/read Emma (Jane Austen) be warned (and pleased) that this is a modern remake.  (And if you haven't seen Emma, check out the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow--not the A&E production.  The Gwyneth Paltrow Emma just as good as this one, since they're the same story ... just different.)",1045008000,,2272,4.542997542997543

This hilarious movie is about a beautiful, popular, shopaholic girl named Cher Horowitz (played wonderfully by Alicia Silverstone), who lives in a mansion in Beverly Hills. She is basically the most popular girl in school along with her friend Dionne (Stacey Dash).

While being in a good ""Helping Out Everyone"" mood, she carries on her good will for the new girl at school Tai (Brittany Murphy), and gives her a very good makeover, and also tries to set Tai up with a guy at school named Elton. Cher thought her plan was working, but after the Val party, her opion changed. Elton was actually into her, not Tai, and he came on to Cher, but Cher told him to back off, and she got out of the car. While in the middle of nowhere, Cher gets held at gun point, and gets her purse stolen, and has to rely on her ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd). Then Cher falls for the new guy at school named Christian, but then she finds out that he's gay (which to me is like ""CHER OPEN YOUR EYES!!! HOW COULD THIS GUY BE STRAIGHT?"") and there are clues throughout the movie that he is gay, like the movies he takes over to Cher's; Some Like it Hot and Sparticus (which Cher called Sparaticus). Tai ends up falling for Josh, and Cher finds out, and tells Tai that she dose't think they ""mesh well"" together and Tai gets mad at her. Well Cher actually finds out that she loves Josh. and that's why she couldn't stand to see him and Tai together. Cher feels so bad about everything she decides to give herslef a makeover, but not the physical kind, the makeover for her soul. So she volunteers for the Pismo Beach Relief fund and donates a ton of stuff. Her and Tai make up, Mr. Hall and Ms. Geist get married...the end.

The reason is to hide the fact that she herself is lonely. She doesn't have that special someone. The film was stylishly and sharply directed by veteran director Amy Heckerling. She also did ""National Lampoon's European Vacation"", ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", and ""Look Who's Talking"". The writing is quick, hip, clever, sharp, and funny. The young actors are all very good and deliver the lines the way they should be delivered. A good cast of young actors. Brittany Murphy, as the fashion victim Silverstone makes over, is a real stand out. Veteran character actor Dan Hedaya plays Alicia's gruff, but well meaning, father. The movie is very colorful. The actors seemed to really take hold of their roles and just have fun with it. It really comes across on screen. The movie makes fun of all the sayings and style of the time, but it's never vulgar or in your face. It plays it with sweet charm. A running joke through the film is that characters are named after music stars. Cher, Dionne, Elton. You get the picture. Stacey Dash, as Dionne, is a real find. Talk about gorgeous!. The movie turned into a surprise hit, both critical and box office wise. It spawned a pretty forgettable T.V. series. Nice movie.",1009324800,7,1532,4.806818181818182
719124,3,6303853102,"This film is just fun. Don't expect any deep messages or hidden meanings, nor any powerhouses of acting or scripting. The best thing is the soundtrack, which uses contemporary pop songs rather than the more usual orchestral music. This sets the piece firmly in the mid 1990s and provides a nice marketing opportunity for CBS! Alicia Silverstone (not as gorgeous as people would have you believe) is a normal American schoolgirl who just happens to have her own car and a very rich father!. The cultural importance of the film is in the language. There are a few films which have changed the way language is used, Wayne's World introduced 'Yes Way!' and other new phrases into our vocabulary, whereas Clueless introduces 'Cher-speak', Cher being Silverstone's character (pronounced 'Share'). Other than that, it's fairly standard fare with the jocks and the nerds being supplemented by the slackers and an un-named ethnic grouping of people.",1001289600,,940,5.1103896103896105

So the story goes: Alicia Silverstone stars in this romantic, comedy, as young Cher Horowitz. Shes got everything, good looks, good grades, and good friends. So now she starts thinking of helping other people improve their life. After playing matchmaker with one of her close friends, Tai Fraiser (Brittany Murphy), a new man enters her life, Christian Stovitz (Justin Walker). In the next few days everything seems to go wrong with her decisons, and she finally comes up with the conclusion that when it comes to love she is well.... clueless. Directed by my favorite directer, Amy Heckerling. Defently a movie worth renting, if not buying.
Roles were also played by Stacey Dash, Paul Rudd, and finally Breckin Meyer.

There is no plot throughout this movie except for the trivial 'living life'.  I have never felt this bored about a movie ever, sitting through it, there was no feeling of wanting to see what was next, probably attributed to the lack of plot.  I got probably an hour into the movie when it struck me that I have absolutely no desire whatsoever to find out how the story plays itself out, how the movie ends.

Grrr. It saddens me to see a whole bunch of the teen population even waste their time over this abomination.  First of all, I just would like to say that I am a seventeen-year-old girl who thinks feminism is all about Joan of Arc, Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, the Bronte sisters, Florence Nightingale, and many more, who made huge individual differences in this world. Compared with Cher, the babe of Hollywood, the girl who can't even think of herself...need I say any more? This movie... is a nightmare. I don't even know why it grates on my nerves so much, but then again on second thought, perhaps it's because this nerve-wracking mess undermines female power. Now, basically, the teen population thinks female power is all about arguing your dimwitted teachers into giving you a higher grade, possess the oh-so-amazing ability to find soulmates for your lost friends, plagiarizing Shakespeare's work (and may I add that the teacher didn't even know who that poem was written by), using Daddy's credit card, not having the common sense to drive with a license, etcetera. Pathetic. The plot itself is boring, unstructured, delivers bad one-liners, and just plain irritating.  Is it just me, or did anyone else notice that before this mess was made, we had TERRIFIC teen movies, such as Dirty Dancing, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Adventures in Babysitting, etc, which made a huge splash? Now, after Clueless, we have Drive Me Crazy, She's All That, Idle Hands, Whatever it Takes, Drop Dead Gorgeous...I rest my case. I'm glad that I spoke out, and have had an emotional catharsis.

719132,4,6303853102,"Director Amy Heckerling knows a thing or two about high school flicks, having directed the highly successful ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".  Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from ""Fast Times"", which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school ""in-crowd"".  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.
The story focuses on Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), who is the most popular girl at Beverly Hills H.S.  Cher seems to be a superficial airhead, but this belies her conniving and manipulative skills at getting what she wants.  Superficial yes, airhead no!  In a plot derived in part from Jane Austen's ""Emma"", Cher works behind the scenes to arrange love matches between various students.  She even orchestrates a relationship between two teachers to improve their moods so they don't grade so harshly.  Like Emma, she is a master of love for everyone but herself.
Heckerling does a fantastic job of presenting what seems to be a cotton candy story with lightweight characters, but which really runs much deeper, revealing subtle truths about human nature.  Her direction of the fledgling cast is superb, milking every ounce of comedy out of each scene.
Silverstone sparkles in the role, which is probably not far from a reality with which she is very familiar.  She actually attended Beverly Hills H.S. with co-star Breckin Meyer, although she didn't graduate due to career commitments (she received a G.E.D.).  This film catapulted her to teen prominence with two MTV movie awards and an American Comedy Award as funniest actress in a leading role.  She plays Cher with both arrogance and vulnerability, and her comic timing is impeccable.  She also has a knack for physical comedy, with a broad range of contorted facial expressions and amusing use of body language.  The rest of the teen cast is also great, especially Brittany Murphy as Tai and Breckin Meyer as Travis.  Dan Hedaya is also priceless as Cher's work obsessed attorney father.
This film is easy to like.  It is a light and funny spoof, but it still has nuance.  I rated it an 8/10.  For those who enjoy high school comedies, this is required viewing.",981849600,3,2647,4.9863325740318905
719184,3,6303853102,"Jeff Sweet Get A Clue Clueless, a modern day version of the story Emma, by Jane Austen, was a film about a young girl growing up in an up class Beverly Hills high school.  Cher, Alicia Silverstone, was a girl that started off very immature and selfish.  During the film Cher also went from being very popular to not so popular.  At the end she was finally enlightened and grew up.  Cher was the average ""miss popular"" everyone has experienced in high school.  She was very self-conscious and worried what people thought of her.  She also hung out with only the cool kids at school.  An example of her selfishness was when she tried to hook up two of her teachers because she had gotten bad grades in one of their classes.  She believed if she hooked them up, they would become happy and give her a good grade.  The whole time she put on the front that she was really doing it for them, but in reality, she was doing it for herself.  She was also very mean to other kids that didn't meet her standards.  Tai, one of Cher's new friends had a crush on a skateboarder; he wasn't cool so Cher tried to hook Tai up with someone who was.  It turned out that the guy didn't even like Tai and was a real jerk while the skateboarder was very kind to her.  For the first part of the movie, Cher was the most popular girl in her School.  Tai, her other friend, was not.  She started of kind of like a scrub.  During the downfall of Cher's popularity, Tai was becoming more popular.  There was one specific scene when Tai was talking to a group of people about her near death experience at the mall and all the people there paid no attention to Cher.  Another thing that was upsetting Cher was her Ex-stepbrother, Josh, was spending a lot of time with Tai and Cher was getting very jealous.  At this point Cher finally realized something had to be done.  What she did was she grew up.  She figured out that she had a crush on Josh and needed to stop being selfish.  An example of not being selfish was when her high school had a day when they excepted donations to give to a third world country.  Cher donated everything from her clothes to her snow skis.  She also started being nice to everyone, not just her cool friends.  The final act that proved she really had matured was she went with Tai to watch that skateboarder in a contest.  After that, Tai and the Skater hooked up and Cher had no problem with it and was even happy for Tai.  Clueless was a very funny film that had a lesson behind it.  The lesson was not to judge people and be kind to everyone.  In the beginning of the movie Cher was a snotty selfish high school girl.  In the middle of the film she lost her popularity and realized she needed to change.  At the end, she finally grew up, stopped judging people, and got a ""clue"".",979776000,,2785,4.25763358778626
719185,3,6303853102,"As a modern day adaptation of the Jane Austen novel Emma, Clueless is the story of a Beverly Hills teen who lets her desire to help others cover up her own unhappiness. Cher, nicely played by Alicia Silverstone, is a cell-phone swinging spoiled teen of a wealthy Beverly Hills attorney who believes she holds the key to the happiness of those around her. From the job she does hooking up two of her teachers, to the attention she gives the new girl in school, Tai, Cher spends the major portion of this movie attempting to help those around her, but completely ignores her own lonliness and inner turmoil. She truly is clueless, but she is also able to eventually moderate her self-sacrificing ways and finds love.
The plot to this movie is rather thin. The major portion of the film is spent engrossing the viewer in the lives of affluent Beverly Hills teens. A viewer is invited to dislike Cher and her friends and dismiss them as shallow and self serving, but instead a feeling of understanding is invoked. The director, Amy Heckerling, is able to show the excess of these teen's lives and ridicule their manners and speech, but their good nature and ignorance allows a viewer to grow to like Cher and her schoolmates.
The central plot of the film concerns the escapades of Cher as she searches for meaning in her life by meddling in the lives of others. Cher begins by matching two of teachers in a romantic relationship. She may have felt that her grade in debate would rise if her teacher got some ""major boinking"", but the fact that the two teachers actually fall in love, and are consequently married at the end of the film, overshadows the interference Cher had been quilty of. Cher recieved her better grade and helped two lonely people find happiness.
Cher also steps in to help a new girl in her class. Cher realized the girl did not fit into the stylish world of Beverly Hills and decides to take a personal hand in her conversion. After a quick make-over and some social lessons, Tai is the toast of the school and she is very happy and comfortable in this situation. This demonstrates another instance that Cher brings happiness to others, and this fact seems to outweigh the the meddling and interference that Cher had to use to create this desirable situation.
Cher's loving generous nature is also demonstrated in her relationship with her father. She had lost her mother when she was very young, and had put herself in the role of looking after her father. She tells him to eat better, packs his suitcases when he has to travel for business, and generally checks out for his general welfare. Cher again puts others happiness before her own. This helps to develop her sense of being clueless. She never actually considers her own needs or desires.
The situation comes to a head when Cher realizes that she herself is very unhappy and missing something in her own life, but no one fixes her situation as she does for others. After some soul searching, she decides to give her soul a makeover. This allows her to realize her sub-consious feelings for her ex-step brother, and allows her to fill the void in her own life and experience love.
Cher does the narrative throughout the film and this offers many insights into the mind of a wealthy Beverly Hills teen. This also allows the audience an insider's view of her motivations and thought processes. Even considering her wealth and shallowness, I was almost tempted to feel sorry for her. She did have a pure heart and the best of intentions, and the voice overs allowed the movie viewer to arrive at this feeling.
The overall tone of the film is lighthearted and satirical. The thoughts and deeds of Cher begin to outweigh the laughable language that she uses and her ever present fashion sense. A viewer can not fault Cher for who she is or how she was raised. Instead, the movie creates an ignorant creature who begs to be liked.
Clueless is an aptly named movie. The characters in this movie are not based in the same reality that I find myself in everyday. The general excesses of the characters in their thoughts and deeds allows the director to make fun of the way they speak and act, but does not create a feeling of ill-will toward them. This is a smart and entertaining movie and clearly attempts to define the whatever generation. The movie goes through great pains and tends to exagerrate just to show a viewer the thoughts and concerns of this lost generation. The end results and feelings a viewer takes away from this movie are well worth the assault that Cher and her friends put on a viewer's mind and common sense. Being clueless is truly one problem that can be solved.",979257600,3,4656,4.624396135265701
719186,4,6303853102,"Upon your first viewing of ""Clueless"", it would appear that it is a sterotypical teen-movie.  Let me assure you, the underlying story is much deeper that would first appear.  Cher Horowitz, played by Alicia Silverstone, would appear to be a typical Beverly Hills rich snob who likes to meddle in others' affairs.  Cher has a gift.  Cher's gift is the art of argument.  Cher always gets her way.  She can even argue her grades from C's to A-'s.  Cher also like to play matchmaker.  During the movie, Cher sets up two of her teachers, Ms. Geist and Mr. Hall (played by Twink Caplan and Wallace Shawn).  Cher's intentions were not necessarily all for her teachers' benefit, but rather her own benefit through their happiness.  If Cher's teachers are happy, she could easily argue her grades.  Cher's main project, though, is a new student from New York, Tai Frasier.  Cher and her best friend Dionne take Tai under their ""popular wings"" and decide to totally transform her into a supermodel.  Cher is so happy with her ""good deed"" that she doesn't realize that she created a monster.  Suddenly, Tai is the most popular girl in school and Cher is left by the roadside.  It is at this moment that Cher realizes how unimportant the things she used to value are.  Cher's character completely matures throughout the movie.  The ultimate maturation occurs when she realizes that the one she ""hates"" the whole time is actually the one she loves.  Cher's ex-brother-in-law, Josh (played by Paul Rudd) is the only person that sees through Cher's ""perfection"" and calls her on her imperfections.  It is Josh's honesty that Cher hates early on, but learns to value in the end.  Believe it or not, this movie is based on ""Emma"", the 1816 classic written by Jane Austen!  From a distance the stories do not seem alike, but believe me, they are!  Almost all the characters are the same!  Cher is Emma, Josh is Mr. Knightly, Christian is Frank Churchill, Travis is Mr. Martin, Tai is Harriet Smith, Mel Horowitz is Mr. Woodhouse, Elton is Mr. Elton, Amber is Mrs. Elton, Dionne is Ms. Taylor, Murray is Mr. Weston, and Mr. Hall/Ms. Geist were simply added to show Cher's matchmaking capabilities.  There are many scenes in the movie that mirror the classic.  The car scene, in which Cher is forced to reject Elton (played by Jeremy Sisto) is exactly like the carriage scene where Emma rejects Mr. Elton.  Josh saves Tai from embarrassment by dancing with her at a dance; The same thing occurs in ""Emma"" between Mr. Knightly and Harriet Smith.  The title ""Clueless"" really is clever because both Emma and Cher truely are clueless to the harm they cause.  Emma and Cher are also clueless of the world outside of their sheltered lives.  Those who have not seen ""Clueless"", must see it, but only after reading the story of ""Emma"".  Those who have seen ""Clueless"" and did not like it, I urge you to read ""Emma"" and watch it again.  ""Clueless"" is simply a modern-day interpretation of a timeless classic!  Open your mind and absorb Amy Heckerlings 1995 version of one of the greatest stories of all time!

719187,5,6303853102,"In Amy Heckerling's adaption of Emma, written by Jane Austen, we get a firsthand look at the lives of a group of affluent youths living in southern California in the 90's. The film, Clueless, is centralized around Cher, who in all reality is totally clueless about the world around her. She is so wrapped up in material things and appearances that she fails to see what is going on right under her nose. The movie begins with Cher showing the audience around her so called ""stomping grounds"" while introducing us to her other affluent friends. In the first scene we get to meet Dionne (played by Stacey Dash) who is Cher's best friend. The relationship between the two best friends was extremely believable because everyone has a friend to talk to when you are happy, sad, or upset. In the next few scenes we meet the rest of the crew that the movie virtually revolves around which includes Murray (Dionne's fun loving boyfriend), Josh (Cher's ex-step brother), Elton (one of the most popular guys in school), Amber (Cruella Deville like) and are later introduced to Tai(new kid from the east coast), and Christian(the mysterious new kid).  If you like the movie Emma, or even thought it was a little dry, you will really like Clueless. It is the same matchmaking  story with a 90's twist. Instead of Gwyenth Paltrow dressed in clothes adapted from the 1800's you get to watch the same basic story with Alicia Silverstone set in the here and now. No stuffy old language and English accents to sift through. In CluelessCher goes through the same situations as the average teenager, for the most part, and that is what makes it really relatable. She ends up getting bad grades on her report card and her, along with best friend sidekick Dionne, hatch a plan to raise not only their grades, but the grades of the entire student body. After her success (and after being told by Josh she is selfish) Cher decides that she needs to find a new project... help Tai become a total betty. The rest of the movie takes the audience through the ins and outs of high school and will have the whole audience remembering their high school days in no time.  Overall I thought the movie was really well done. Even though some say that Cher came off as being ditzy, I thought that she was rather smart and often clever. This can be seen in the scene where Josh is giving Cher and his girlfriend a ride home. The whole ride his girlfriend is constantly talking, during the incessant ramble she says that Hamlet says a quote that he really doesn't and Cher corrects her on it. Sure, she learned the quote from the movie with Mel Gibson, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she knew that. It doesn't matter where you get your information through, as long as you get it and retain it. Clueless is a good movie, so check it out... but a helpful hint to all- skip the television series.",979171200,11,2871,4.560077519379845
719188,5,6303853102,"In order to understand ""Clueless"" in its fullest sense and for what it really means, one must look past the apparent idealism and optimism that Beverly Hills high school life puts on display and see its true meaning.  In actuality, ""Clueless"" is a classic love story focusing on the maturation of a young girl into a young woman (although these events may eventually make her a woman, but after all, she is only 16).  Yes, ""Clueless"" is a modern-day version of Jane Austen's novel ""Emma"", but it should also be given the individual attention and critical acclaim that it deserves.
Throughout the film, Cher seems to have everything going for her.  Her father is rich, she gets what she wants (sometimes at the expense of others), and she is surrounded by California pop-culture.  What more could a girl ask for?  Well, add to this the facts that she is self-absorbed, spoiled, and egotistical and you have the makings for a rather unpleasant personality.  Luckily, Cher is sweet and charming, allowing her to come off as pleasing and flawless to most.  Combine this with the fact that she is rather intelligent, although the ditzy persona is a front encouraged by society, and you have the makings of a rather outstanding person who just needs a little lesson about life and love - exactly the point of the film.
Cher's problem is that people just like her, namely Dionne, surround her.  It is even stated by Cher that they are not friends because they like each other, but rather, ""she's my friend because we both know what it is to have people be jealous of us.""  Now, this comes off as a rather arrogant statement - as well it should - but Cher's outlook on life is about to be drastically altered - that is, after she ""develops"" Tai.  Cher's ""charity work"" extends to everyone and when she notices the ""project"" of Tai, there is no stopping her.  At this point, Cher feels that she is doing Tai a favor (as does Tai feel likewise), when in actuality, Cher is partaking in these actions because of, and through selfish means.  Cher wants to help out Tai because she doesn't have a clue - or rather, she doesn't have Cher's definition of a clue - when really, it is Cher who is ""clueless.""  Fortunately, when Tai's ""development"" starts to get out of hand, Cher is able to step back and realize what she has done - she has created herself.  And she hates it.  Only now does Cher realize what she has been doing wrong all of this time - that being living through others and also not allowing herself to be loved.
Sure, many minor love episodes occur throughout the film, but the one at hand is the only love that matters.  After all, it does complete the classic love story.  Only after Cher is ""challenged"" for love does she actually open her eyes, and heart, to it.  Tai foolishly expresses her love for Josh when it is apparent that it has no chance, but this served as a mind-opening experience for Cher, for she realized that ""her"" love was meant to be.  Josh is the man that she has been looking for all along and he could now be hers, for she is on the path to becoming a woman.
Throughout all of this chaos, which seemed to get a little hectic at times, love emerges and settles in the place that it belongs.  Who knows, if not for Tai, maybe Cher would have never gotten to know, understand, and be secure with herself.  In other words, to become that person that she is capable of being.  Fortunately, things did turn out for the best - an apparent aspect of a classic love story - and Cher's maturation will continue, hopefully strengthening the bond, friendship, companionship, and love between her and Josh.",979171200,,3620,4.528417818740399
719189,4,6303853102,"Are you ready to party with the Valley girls?  Amy Heckerling's Clueless is an interesting portrayl of high school girls in Beverly Hills.  She brings humor along with some interesting lessons to the lives of teenagers.  Alicia Sliverstone plays the main character Cher.  There's no one else who could play this part so well.  She's funny and captures our attention with her role as ""rich girl"".  Cher is the typical rich girl in high school with her popular friends and keen fashion sense. She can handle being a part of everyone else's personal life but when it comes to her own personal life she's lost.  Humor is brought into the lives of these girls when we see how these girls live.  With their computerized closets, cell phones, credit cards, and expensive cars.  It's rich girls to the extreme.  Cher's main goal in this movie is to make people happy.  How she goes about making people happy is a different story. She'll do everything and anything.  When a new girl comes to town Cher has to be the one to give her a make-over and show her the right crowd to hang around with. This also leads to Cher's adventures in matchmaking. One way Cher likes to spread happiness to everyone is by playing matchmaker.  This is also where she finds trouble.  While trying to create matches between people she doesn't see the match for herself right before her eyes. The matchmaking we see in this film is very much like the book ""Emma"" written by Jane Austen. If you haven't read it see it on video.  ""Emma"" takes place in a different time period but the similarities between Emma and Cher are amazing.  The two movies have parallel characters and scenes. If you've seen ""Emma"" you'll enjoy Clueless even more. It's great to see a similarity in movies that portray totally different time periods. Clueless takes ""Emma"" to the extreme with teens.  We see what it was like to live then as opposed to now, with the cell phone and computerized closets. Even though the times are different the underlying themes are the same.  There's the ""perfect"" girl trying her hardest to make everyone happy, yet she's does it in such a clueless manner.  She's trying to make others happy but she's doesn't always chose the best ways of doing things.  People may hate Cher for her cluelessness but when it comes down to it she's only doing things for good reason.  There's no bad intentions in her heart.  She may be annoying and some will see her as a ""dumb blonde"" but not many people are as caring.  There are lessons to be taught in this movie and if you find these lessons you have really ""seen"" the movie and you aren't as ""clueless"" as some.",979171200,5,2627,4.578158458244111
719190,4,6303853102,"Not many characters in many movies are truly clueless.  Monty Python's Sir Bedevere, and Adam Sandler's Pip, from Airheads come to mind immediately.  Their stupidity is just that, though, and not much more.  In Clueless, Alicia Silverstone's Cher Horowitz is not only dumb in the traditional meaning of the word, but she is also blind to the impact she has on the people in her life.  Silverstone (The Crush, Batman and Robin) plays Horowitz perfectly, as if she were typecast for the role.  Horowitz goes through her life seemingly meeting every hardship the only daughter of a Beverly Hills litigation lawyer can meet.  ""Searching for a boy in high school is like searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie,"" Cher quips amusingly. Along with her friend, Dionne, Cher majestically controls the people around her like the best puppeteer.  Throughout the days and weeks we are let into her life, Cher slowly comes to realize her own lack of depth, who she truly loves, and the damage she does to the people around her seemingly under the guise of good-doing.  IMDB.com says that the story is ""loosely"" based on Jane Austen's Emma, though I found most of the story of Clueless could be directly related somehow to Emma.  Although at times, it may seem like a gaudy translation, Clueless contradicts its title in entertainment value, as well as bringing to light some personal conflicts.  Casting Director Marcia Ross deserves a pat on the back for filling in the roles flawlessly.  It is easy to discern what a character is all about upon first seeing him or her in the movie.  Too, most characters from Clueless have some sort of ties to a corresponding character from Austen's Emma.  Stacey Dash (Mo' Money, Clueless television series) is great as Dionne, Cher's best friend and confidant.  Jeremy Sisto (Suicide Kings) plays Elton who, upon immediate sighting, can be interpreted as everyone's favorite and the most popular.  Paul Rudd (The Object of My Affection, The Cider House Rules) steals the show, however, playing Cher's irresistible and sensitive ex-stepbrother, Josh. Unfortunately, not too much can be said for the script because hearing ""valley girl speak"" for 97 minutes can, at times, be annoying and aggravating.  The style most likely strikes a chord with teenagers who, for the most part, partake in the pace and informality of the dialect.  On the other hand, many of the exchanges between characters are witty and amusing, redeeming the dialogue to a point where even people of considerable knowledge and understanding of the world around us can find humor.  For example: Josh's girlfriend Heather: ""It's just like Hamlet said, `To thine own self be true.'"" Cher: ""Hamlet didn't say that."" Heather: ""I think I remember Hamlet accurately."" Cher: ""Well, I remember Mel Gibson accurately, and he didn't say that. That Polonius guy did."" This exchange is witty and intelligent, indeed, despite its roots in shallowness and lack of worldly knowledge.  Overall, I would say that at least, Clueless is entertaining.  At its high points, the story raises some interesting questions about coming of age and maturity.  Without revealing too much of the plot, I will say that as the movie progresses, Cher truly comes to understand how clueless she, in fact, is.  The happy ending caps the movie with a nice layer of sweetness, leaving the viewer with hope for the characters, after all.  Do not watch the movie with too critical an eye, but do take note of the message it delivers about self-awareness and maturity.  In the end, the story is fun, and that is really all that's important.",979171200,4,3599,4.950083194675541
719191,3,6303853102,"The film Clueless gives new meaning to the word ""matchmaker.""  In this movie, Cher is the main character who tries to setup her newest creation, Tai, into dating her friend Elton.  The only problem is, Elton likes Cher. Alicia Silverstone, who portrays Cher portrays the ""Valley Girl"" image perfectly.  Cher is spoiled rotten and uses such phrases as; ""whatever"" and ""as if.""  Cher does take care of her father and makes sure that he eats properly, although her father is widowed, he often mixes business with home life and raising Cher.
Cher has a ""ex stepbrother"" named Josh who comes to visit and starts to look for a job with the help of his former stepfather.  Josh is sensible and reasonable and helps by giving advice to Cher about her ""high school"" type problems.  Josh's sensibility matches that of Mr. Knightley in the film ""Emma.""  Josh is the only person that honestly tells Cher how what she does to people, good or bad, affects them.  At the beginning it appears as though Cher is generally annoyed at what Josh has to say and does.  Although she feels this way, he is the first person she calls when Elton left her in a parking lot after Cher refused his advances.  Cher has a lot of trust in what Josh does for her, and she knows he will always be there.
Overall, I enjoyed the cast of characters, I thought them all to be believable in their respective roles and I thought they all personified the ""Beverly Hills"" characteristics very well.  I enjoyed watching Cher and her attempts at getting what she wants and her reactions to things that didn't quite go the way she anticipated they would.  I also enjoyed the narrative that Cher provided, I think it really helped because it allowed the audience to somewhat be included in the movie and thus made the movie fast paced.
Although there were good things in the movie which I enjoyed, I really thought that it was sugar-coated.  Some of the language got annoying after awhile and the constant cell phone use made the movie at times hard to believe.  I do realize that it was supposed to be a light hearted movie, but the whole relationship between students and Mr. Hall was really over the top.  The fact that a teacher would actually allow students to have cell phones was extreme and the whole arrangement to set up Mr. Hall and Mrs. Geist was as well.
I did enjoy watching the movie and felt right at home with some of the topics discussed.  That is why if I were going to compare Emma and Clueless, I would have to say I liked Clueless better.  I felt as though even though Cher was portrayed as a ditz, she did have a lot of saved knowledge.  She really did care about the feelings of others, it just took a few mistakes in her matchmaking to help her to realize that.",979084800,,2741,4.480885311871227
719192,4,6303853102,"Clueless is a fun filled comedy/satire about Cher, (actress Alicia Silverstone), a teenager who likes to set up friends and teachers, sometimes for her benefit.  Cher lives in California with her wealthy father Mel, actor Dan Hedaya.  She's not your normal teenager.  Her idea of getting dressed in the morning is picking out an outfit by the means of not looking through her closet, but rather by searching her computer's database of all the clothes she owns.  She's even notified if she mismatches her clothes.  Dionne, (Stacey Dash), is Cher's best friend and confidante.  Their social circle is made up of all the popular sophomores who attend high school in Beverly Hills.  A ""clueless"" new student arrives and Cher feels the need to enhance Tai Fraiser's, (Brittany Murphy), looks and social standing.  Tai takes to Cher and Dionne as if they were her best friends in the world; this makes Cher's ""project"" worthwhile.  Other key players of the film include Paul Rudd I as the character Josh, Breckin Meyer as Travis, and Jeremy Sisto as Elton.  Rudd has played in the 1996 version of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"".  Sisto played Jesus in the 1999 made for TV movie ""Jesus"".  Cher tries to set up Tai and a popular guy friend, Elton.  The plan backfires and Cher is the one Elton was after all along.  But this doesn't stop Cher.  She manages to make two of her teachers fall in love with each other, thus enhances her grades as well as other student's.  Clueless, while unrealistic and sometimes corny, is still a film that is hard not to enjoy.  It shows the social groups that are often found in high school, such as the slackers, the TV station crew, and those who are popular.  Clueless also shows the naivety and ""cluelessness"" in which we have all been.  Cher especially.  She, at one point in the movie, is being held at gunpoint for her purse and phone.  The man tells her to lie down on the ground and she says no because she'll ruin her expensive, designer dress.  Cher also quotes ""Cliff's Notes"" and Mel Gibson when arguing her points.  Some may notice the similarities in Clueless and Jane Austen's ""Emma"".  Emma and Cher play the same role: both are the matchmakers, the leader of their circle of friends.  Other characters have the same personalities and traits.  Even some scenes are in the same content.  This movie isn't for those who are realists or don't like teenagers who think they own the world.  Many people, however, feel the film is a nice break from the real world.  Clueless gives people a chance to laugh and have a fun time.  And what's wrong with that?  The title ""Clueless"" definitely fits the movie.  Not only is Cher clueless, other characters fall into this description very well.  If you are in the mood for some clean, harmless fun, watch Amy Heckerling's Clueless.",978998400,6,2813,4.71047227926078
719223,5,6303853102,"A wonderful up to date retelling of Jane Austen's, 'Emma'.  Cher (Silverstone) has a privileged life, she goes to a great school and is popular along with her good friend Dionne (Dash).
She lives with her widowed father (Hedaya) and the only pebble under her perfectly manicured feet is her ex step-brother Josh (Rudd).
Cher loves to play matchmaker and can't resist the challenge when she meets the new girl in school, Ty, who isn't exactly 'popular' material at first glance.  Having taken her under her wing and given her a complete makeover, Cher then tries to match her up with various boys.
This is alright until Ty takes a fancy to Josh and then Cher suddenly realises that she has feelings for him herself - but who will get the man?
Silverstone is absolutely fantastic in this film.  She handles the difficult role SO well and you can't help but really like Cher and want her to get the man of her dreams for all her obvious flaws.

719225,5,6303853102,"This clever, modern retelling of Jane Austen's novel ""Emma "" was one of the best high-school theme films made in the past twenty years. Written and directed by Amy Heckerling (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""; ""Look Who's Talking) spent a year in the lives of several teens at various high schools in Los Angeles to give the filmgoer a truly authentic look at life among the young social elites of Southern California.
Alicia Silverstone (""Excess Baggage""; ""Batman & Robin"") stars as Cher Horowitz, a young, hip teen residing with her lawyer father (Dan Hedaya) in Beverly Hills. Along with best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash of ""Mo' Money""), the girls are the  doers of social good deeds at their high school. Whether it is trying to play matchmaker for two lonely teachers (playwright Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplan, who is also an executive producer of the film) or doing a serious make over for Tai (Brittany Murphy) a new, dowdy student from the east coast, Cher is the toast of the school among her peers.
However, playing matchmaker for others has made Cher realized that she too needs to find someone special in her life.  Pestered by her ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) in doping deeds that benefits others and not only herself, Cher discovers that what she truly needs is a spiritual makeover that will allow her to attain happiness and respect. Yet, she wonders why it bothers  her so much on what Josh is thinking? As the story progresses, we discover that opposites attract and Cher has realized how ""clueless"" she was while looking for Mr. Right.
Wonderfully directed and casted,""Clueless"" features some  memorable performance by Julie Brown (as Ms. Stoger, the physical education instructor), Donald Faison (as Dionne's  boyfriend Murray) and Justin Walker, as Christian Stovitz. Walker who plays his role with comedic sensibility is great and witty as the boy Cher has the hots for, although she has little knowledge about his background.
""Clueless"" is one of the best films released in the 1990's due to his smart use of popular lexicon, icons, and attitudes that can be attributed to most American teenagers. This is  Silverstone's greatest performance to date, seeing that most of her later works did not go well with critics or filmgoers. Although a television series based on the film was launched in  1997, it couldn't capture the charm, wit, and performances of this film.

719314,4,6303853102,"The good news is that ""Clueless"" is witty and funny and doesn't sink into self-parody; the bad news is the rash of teen movies that followed and have  consistently tried, and failed, to emulate its success.  On the surface,  the movie seems an homage to the materialistic snobbery of young America,  but peel through the beaded curtains of shopping bags and Valley  Girl-speak, and you'll find a light romantic comedy somewhere along the  lines of, well, ""Emma,"" the Jane Austen novel from which this  movie comes.
This successful attempt to translate a classic into modern  context doubles as an effective satire of the superficial teen culture  generated on TV and in movies.  You don't take these guys too seriously and  because of that, the story is both fun and engaging.  Cher, the pretty  gum-popping, cell phone-toting heroine, loves clothes, boys, and her dad,  in about that order.  She manages everyone else's life just fine but is  clueless when it comes to her own.  Not only does she have to overcome  normal teenage struggles like a doting dad, difficult homework, and rocky  friendships, she's got to deal with matching her undergarments, dresses,  and shoes, failing her driver's test, and falling in love with her  ex-step-brother.  Tough life, eh?  But it's those little quirks along  Cher's inflated path to self-discovery that make this movie such a gem.  Her humorous approach and response to any situation immediately recalls  Austen's Emma.
Critics can whine all they want about Alicia Silverstone,  but she delivers a standout performance as Cher, giving her both brains and  tenderness and giving us a character to care about.  Cher is at once  innocent, smart, sexy, compassionate, and mature.  Silverstone is so  convincing, she hasn't been able to escape her role.  The supporting cast  is excellent as well, especially Dan Hedeya as her overprotective yet  loving father.

The  rest of the cast complements Silverstone perfectly: Paul Rudd is relaxed  and charming as Josh, as unaware of his true feelings as Cher is of hers;  Stacey Dash is witty and wry as Dionne, Cher's closest friend; and Dan  Hedaya (a fine actor too often cast in cold, unsympathetic roles) is warm  and knowing as Cher's crusty father whose bark hides a heart of gold.

Cher is an exageration of a typical teen girl just  with a lot more money than most. After watching Clueless I actually learned  a few things. Like the meaning of spuratically. I think it is an excellent  movie for pre-teens and teens but adults may enjoy it also.,946339200,,431,4.430379746835443

7853623,5,6303853102,"So I grew up during this time but for some reason never watched this when it came out even though I had a huge crush on Alicia Silverstone having watched The Crush and the Aerosmith videos, think I just thought it was a chick flick or something and none of my high school guy friends ever showed interest in seeing it.  Was in 10th grade when this came out.

ANYWAY, fast forward to me being almost 40 and I finally watched it - wow it's freaking great.  Not a chick flick at all, it's super funny actually and just really uplifting and likeable.  Like it put me in a good mood when I watched it and have watched it more than once now and always in a good mood during and after.  Plus I mean it's easy to look at Alicia for an hour and a half good grief talk about a gorgeous chick.",1520812800,,782,4.0519480519480515
