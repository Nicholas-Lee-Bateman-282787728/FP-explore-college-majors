4253947,5,B004393V64,"Cool Dog is one of the greatest movies of the past decade. What appears to be a simple movie about a boy and his dog on the surface is really a uncompromising examination of class, crime and religion in today's society. I don't want to spoil too much, but you will be surprised at how deeply Cool Dog plumbs the depths of your soul. You will laugh, but you will cry, and in the end you will come back a better human being.

Everybody, young and old, should watch Cool Dog. Rainy is the hero we need in these times, and he will inspire you as he inspired me.",1296518400,27,557,4.110091743119266
4253948,3,B004393V64,"Possible spoiler alert.

I didn't particular like this movie. Too melodramatic for me. Where's the fun in that!? Combined with some, what seems to me unneeded and totally phony fantasy. Why did Rainey need to drive a car? But..... kids (10 and 6 yol) watched through it and had some laughs. Rating 3 stars because of that that. My 6 yol liked the scene where Rainey is shooting tennis balls at the bully.",1295222400,4,404,4.534246575342466
4253949,5,B004393V64,"any kid that likes dogs even a little will love this fun, adventurous movie.  It probably could be picked apart by adults who have no sense of fun and wonder and hope but through a child's eyes this is terrific!  The dog is a dog that kids yearn for: one that is smart, fun and protective and will do anything for his best friend.
""Cool Dog"" is funny enough for the family to sit down to together.  Only drawback I can see is the kids will want a dog just like, ""Rainy""!",1294099200,3,470,4.086956521739131

4254008,1,B004393V64,"Horrible movie that nearly crushed my 7 y.o. daughter's heart by adding a completely gratuitous scene where the dog dies (from what?  Who knows...), then miraculously comes back to life - presumably an act of God.",1405382400,,213,4.916666666666667

4254016,4,B004393V64,"My 8-year old son really likes dogs so this seemed like a good show for him to watch.  It's about a boy and his ""best friend"", his pet German Shepherd.  They are forced to separate when the boy's father takes a job in New York.  The dog then makes his way to New York in search of the boy.  Meanwhile, the boy is struggling with the move, his new school, etc.  The movie is about the dog's adventures along the way to NY as well as after he reunites with the boy.

The movie is fairly predictable, but hey, it's a kid's movie.  There are funny parts, sad parts, and happy scenes.  There's enough action to keep the story moving.  All in all, it was something fun to watch with my child.  And yes, he really liked it.",1402963200,,716,4.1231884057971016

The acting is terrible, (laughable, really) but still managed to watch all the way through.  Kind of like a ""Home Alone"" but with a dog as the main character.

The German Shepherd is the best actor in the film, followed by the kid.

The father fails to tell his kid they are moving 2000 miles away - without the dog - until a few days before it's scheduled to happen (seriously?).  The kid wouldn't even have had the head's up unless the step mom broke the news.  When the step mom hints to the dad that he should have told his son himself and sooner, the dad blames the step mom for upsetting the kid (what a putz).

The dog pretty much took care of everyone in the entire town, yet they leave him with...the State Fair Zoo?

All that and more in the first few horrible minutes of the movie...I couldn't stomach any more - even though I am a German Shepherd fan.",1389139200,,900,4.228070175438597

Dog plays banjo, drives car, steers boat, beats up bullies, eludes bad guys, survives horrible injuries and saves day.
Best character is the evil lead female character - funny evil with laughable lines.
Worst character is the father's girlfriend - in a movie filled with bad acting, hers is the most painful to watch.",1387497600,,445,4.868421052631579

For me, this movie would have been impossible to get through if not for looking over at my 7 year old and seeing how happy she looked <**SPOILER ALERT**> UNTIL THEY NEARLY KILLED THE DOG AT THE END.  The dog was motionless, a paramedic comes in, pronounces the DOG DEAD, puts it on a stretcher, and before they haul it away, it magically ""wakes up"" due to a piece of red licorice having been given it for its trip to heaven - where there would be more red licorice waiting (according to the kid).  O.K. Sure.. Well, my kids were screaming for the 2 minutes it took to ""revive"" the dog with the candy.  They really loved that old dog and knocking it off was very abrupt and definitely unexpected.

Another odd thing about this movie: I don't think I've seen a porn since I was 11 (I'm 45), but everyone in this movie seems to me to be a moonlighting porn actor or actress.  Some of the props and sets seem to be moonlighting too.... not a big deal... just sayin. Maybe it's the quality of the acting and writing (or lack of), but whatever...

What I think this might be is that some porn people got some time off, rented a smart dog and a few child actors and made a ""clean"" film while they were in between jobs.  I have no proof and don't really care, but that's what it seems like.

So, if you have kids, they might like the movie.  You probably won't, but maybe you can joke about how bad and weird it all is.",1343001600,4,1577,4.185430463576159

Yup. He's one smart dog. There is some slapstick and mild violence (Mostly along the lines that you would see in the movie ""Eloise"". Not nearly as much as you would see in ""Home Alone"").

1. 90% of the film credits for the lead actors consists of B movies no one has ever heard of, or TV spots. Hmmm, I wonder what that suggests?
2. Storyline of dog as small town icon; is left behind by family that is moving far far away; is left in the care of a ne'er-do-well run animal hospice; takes off but only after creating a bit of havoc in letting animal captives in hospice loose; to find boy owner in far away place; performs acts that only humans can perform; finally receives award ceremony for catching bad people (usual parade, speeches, ribbons and mayor). Nothing creative, every scene ripped off from countless previous dog movies.
3. Really bad human acting with wooden, read-the-teleprompter, scripts and emotionless acting to back it up. Except for the painfully obvious glycerine tears for actors incapable of eliciting real tears.
4. The most fake animal scenes since the '50s. Dog running from point A to point B, treat, cut & edit, B to C, treat, cut & edit, etc; propped dog driving police car and tugboat with hands on steering wheels; dog playing piano except all you see are artificial dog limbs moving across a keyboard; dog and other animals dancing by reverse film editing of some simple movement -  many times, over and over. Boring. No wonder animals end up being so mistreated when children grow up thinking that this is what they're suppose to act like - only to be disappointed. And dog moves to rap music - must be marketing/persuading to a young audience.

8414323,4,B004393V64,"Cool Dog is a movie that's for children.  No question about it.  It'd be difficult for an adult to watch this because the storyline is just too predictable, clichd and oversentimental for an adult.  Basically it's about a kid played by Jackson Pace who's forced to move to New York City with his dad and stepmom (Christa Campbell) because, rather predictably, his dad's new job forces them to move.  A clichd story if I do say so.  It's been used thousands of times by this point.

Anyway as you can probably guess, the apartment doesn't allow pets of any kind and this includes German Shepherds too.  This makes Jackson incredibly disappointed.  Jen Kober, the tenant of the apartment, is about as nasty as one can imagine.  She has a VERY unpleasant attitude towards pets and kids.  However there's a secret that she's keeping- she's actually keeping pets in the basement of the building for suspicious money-making reasons.  The story gets really whacky when this part arrives, and actually lost me by then.

Anyway the story is supposed to be about this German Shepherd who makes the amazing journey from Louisiana to New York.  He's a clever dog- he's able to trick the local small town zookeeper (where the dog's being kept oddly enough and not a boarding kennel) cause a ruckus, make all the animals boisterous and pursue their attempt to mess with the zookeeper (including baboons and a hilarious scene with a spitting alpaca among others) until the dog eventually escapes, aboards a train with a few checker-playing drifters, and makes his way to the city. I feel the story could have shown more tear-jerking excitement upon the dog arriving to the city.  Instead he arrives and the family treats it as a fairly normal trip.  Really?  The dog just travelled from the south to the north of the United States on his own!  But it wasn't a big deal according to this family.  It's almost like they expected it.  Odd.

Anyway Christa's acting abilities feel really bad to me.  Every line she says is forced.  It's like she was uncomfortable playing the role of a stepmom (though her role is fairly limited anyway).  Jackson however is a terrific actor and possesses exactly the right kind of enthusiastic demeanor necessary for such a role.  He loves his dog.  He often gets picked on outside the school building by bigger and older bullies which is to be expected because city kids can be rough, until he meets a friend (Cameron Ten Napel) who makes his arrival to the city school feel more welcoming.  She encourages Jackson not to let the older boys bully him around.

I really liked the scene where the German Shepherd chases down a crook who steals an old lady's pocketbook.  Great writing there.  Perhaps this is wrong of me to mention this, but it felt too hokey the way Jackson visited his mom's grave, talked to her about his disappointment in being forced to move and not be able to take the dog all the while the father is standing right next to him listening to the entire conversation.  To me, if I was the father I'd be thinking ""Wow I should *really* do everything in my power to bring this dog along with us!  I had no idea my son had such a bond with this dog!"" but instead... no compassion from the father.  Awkward writing.  Most fathers would show a nicer more understanding side, especially since this segment occurs right after a dinner conversation where the father says the dog's a part of the family.

The movie is entertaining overall- it's just got some clichd moments in the writing and questionable acting parts from time to time, with an exceptionally outrageous second half with the animals kept in the apartment basement  Otherwise decent movie for kids.",1444780800,,3690,4.694704049844237
