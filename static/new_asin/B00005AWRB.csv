7936085,2,B00005AWRB,"This film has some great action. Particularly, a fight with snakes, the temple fight, the finale, and Jackie's fight against the crazy widow. The 3D effects are cool and the twist at the end is a complete surprise The cinematography is good and this film with a mystery element has some decent dialogue. Everything else about this film is pitiful. I recommend watching this film once and see what you think.",1470268800,,407,4.746478873239437
7936086,3,B00005AWRB,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could add it to the collection he plans to take on his cruise around the world.",1360022400,,149,3.838709677419355
7936087,1,B00005AWRB,I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan but I even have to admit that this movie was just plain bad and trying to read the english subtitles gave me a headache but worth a watch once for the hardcore Jackie fans to see how his early movies were like plus you get to see a young Jackie.,1326758400,,272,3.875
7936088,1,B00005AWRB,"I love Jackie Chan!  Absolutely love him!  Sadly, this ISN'T a real ""Jackie Chan type"" movie.  Filmed at the pre-beginning of his career, it's one of the movies Jackie made for Lo Wei.  That should tell you something.  There wasn't a single movie he made for Lo Wei that was even remotely good.  Tell you the truth, people -  I actually stopped it about 20 minutes in to the show and never finished it.  Yuck comes to mind.  But then Jackie would be the first to tell you that.  Everything he made with Lo Wei was a bomb.  If it says, Jackie Chan and Lo Wei together, anywhere on a DVD, run!  Truely not worthy of Jackie's talents.",1276300800,2,631,4.254237288135593
7936089,5,B00005AWRB,"If you are a kung fu movie fan, Pick This Up. The Quailty isn't that great, But the story and action itself is. A Classic Jackie Chan Movie.",1233619200,,140,4.035714285714286
7936090,4,B00005AWRB,"This is a bit similar to ""The Killer Meteors"", contains some complicated stories, unbelievable attacks(comedy!?) or so.  That means this is is a very Hong Kong movie!!  But looks little more serious than KM and have more Kang-fu action.  I think Jackie is so cool in Chinese traditional costume.
Conclusion --> Must see item for classic fans.",1058745600,5,342,4.964912280701754
7936091,3,B00005AWRB,"i like the most of the Jackie Chan's pre-humoristics movies and this movie is one of the best. Magnificient Bodyguards is outstanding for the standard of the 70's hk movies, the history is unpredictable, and full of action all the movie... the final fight is amazing... if you like the old kung fu movies you will enjoy Magnificient bodyguards.",996710400,2,344,4.8474576271186445
7936092,1,B00005AWRB,Well...This movie was interesting.  The Star Wars music at the end action scene was a diffrent idea.  Also the 3D shots are kinda funky to watch.  A good buy for a good laugh.,916876800,,175,4.242424242424242
