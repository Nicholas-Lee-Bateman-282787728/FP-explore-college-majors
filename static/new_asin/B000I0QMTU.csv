one of the worse movies I have ever seen!  Don't waist your money!",1373414400,,189,4.5588235294117645
8142707,2,B000I0QMTU,"Wouldn't I just be the lucky one who received the box and the disc, but the disc was totally blank. Tried it on 3 computers and 2 dvd players, but nothing happened.  Then I looked at the disc.  Usually the recorded section will be visible if you shift the disc in the light.  In my case, the disc appears to be blank.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to track down the private seller I bought it from to ask for an adjustment.  I hope this is an isolated incident.  I'd buy it again, but uneasy about it happening again.",1303084800,3,523,4.232323232323233
8142708,4,B000I0QMTU,"This was an odd little movie, while there are some interesting things about it, the distracter was the way that they tied the movie together with a couple of guys in period costume, and treated it more like a voyeur bit than a review of older movies. Porn and Cinema (even Edison made a racy movie) paint a picture of people's internal morals that either are or are not acted on. Rather than showing a bunch of movies that could be literally shown on a premium channel right now, they tried to be cute about it. So that distracted from what the movie could have been.

There was little history on the movie, where it came from, and a lot of them were the early French brothel movies, most were from Europe in the early bit, the one about Hitler was drop down funny. Overall ok to own, but not what I expected, I really wanted something to focus on the American cinema, and very early cinema at that, this was and was not it, there was only one American movie (as best I could tell), makes it hard to do much with it if you are interested in the historical context of dirty old movies.",1219017600,15,1084,4.262135922330097
