And they resemble that comment, and they probably resemble idiots too, but, SO WHAT!

Just because your ""kids"" are ""normal"" doesn't make them better because you and your friends want everyone to be just like you and your pretentious attitude of ""my kids are better than your kids"" mind-set.

Why must ""kids"" in a uber competitive world win at everything they do?  Have we become a white-washed version of Japan minus the selfless worker
culture mindset?

Relax, enjoy your childhood kids, don't be in such a hurry to have all the freedoms you think adults take for granted, with all those freedoms come a lot of stress, more than you think is overwhelming adolescence, a big part of that stress leads to drug abuse, I'm talking about the criminal double-standard of demonizing harmless drugs like cannabis and making legal harmful drugs like cigarettes, alcohol, beer, prescription drugs, caffeine, and especially dubious is the carte blanche given thousands of religions (AKA cults) with harmful side affects that continue to destroy society on all class/ethnic levels.

Oh, did I mention that drugs enslave/control people?
Refusing to imbibe in one drug only to take up another drug only solves part of that problem, but since there's always someone, somewhere with another drug to replace that other drug you were addicted to, someone will always be there to make money off of your self-imposed self-loathing/misery/self-guilt/genetic pre-disposition to addiction, etc.

Free your mind of society's chains and you won't need drugs/religion as an emotional crutch to hobble around through life as an emotional cripple.

Of course, I'm one to talk, I'm addicted to a life free of things that most people can't seem to live without such as: irrational hatred of certain people, places, things or even behavior that they will go to great lengths to try and destroy, restrict, eliminate and failing that, deceive other people into giving up their own rights in order to eliminate the rights of all people just to demonize/annoy a certain group because their inbreed ignorance won't allow them to tolerate anything that they can't control or get away with suppressing.",1205971200,,2393,5.152061855670103
8044918,5,B000768FIG,"Make no mistake, ""Bloopy's Buddies"" is probably not for any kids over the age of say, six years, because it's clearly targeted at toddlers.  Unlike super-slick or animated programs, there's a genuine quality to the Bloopy character and a ""likeable"" factor that toddlers find more inviting than bizarre looking Teletubbies.  These would be great on DVD, and I hope they are eventually available in this format.",1202601600,,409,5.181818181818182
