So far this is the only live show availbe online that I've found, the only downside to this show in particular is Pat T. isn't singing, he lost his voice a couple days before the show.

But for fans, this is a must own! thier music is getting harder and harder to find each day so get a copy while you can.",1361491200,,465,3.9361702127659575
