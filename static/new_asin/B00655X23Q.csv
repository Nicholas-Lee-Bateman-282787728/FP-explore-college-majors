8493312,4,B00655X23Q,the earrings are so bad I don't know where to start. I have no idea what the bead is made of but it looks awful and is set crooked in the earrings. the silver and marcasite is going a long way to call it that. what a shame was  hoping to like them.,1500336000,,248,3.6792452830188678
8493313,5,B00655X23Q,Such a great tool for helping baby communicate before they are able to talk. I bought this copy and vol 1 for our third baby after giving away our other copies (before we decided to have a third baby). They are also so wonderful for older siblings as they learn and help teach the babies in the family. It really helps with the frustration babies feel!,1412812800,,352,4.348484848484849
8493314,5,B00655X23Q,"my little girl started watching these dvd's at 8months old, while I made dinner and she played in her exersaucer. She learned to sign before she could speak her mind, and it really helped knowing what she wanted. I got these for a friend's baby and hopefully her little one will learn just as much.",1371081600,,298,4.4363636363636365
