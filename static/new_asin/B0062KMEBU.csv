8491217,4,B0062KMEBU,"This obscure 1975 private eye comedy isn't for everyone but if you are sufficiently familiar with what's being parodied, namely 1970's Universal Television crime series, then it's pretty spot on and hilarious.  Writer/director Dean Hargrove is a veteran writer producer on a lot of TV crime shows, including Columbo and McCloud.  With Manchu Eagle Murder Caper Mystery he pokes fun at the kind of stuff he did regularly in his day job and does surprisingly well considering that he's not someone whose name was ever associated with comedy.

TV character actor Gabriel Dell gets a rare lead role as the dim-witted Malcolm, a poultry engineer and wannabe private eye.  His first client is the local milkman who wants protection because he claims someone is trying to kill him and he's right--the man barely has the chance to hire Malcolm before he's dead.  This leads Malcolm into a mystery involving bestiality, incest, a pill popping doctor, a suicidal school teacher (Barbara Harris, a standout in one of the movie's funniest scenes), the nymphomaniac wife of the dead milkman, a sinister wealthy local named Big Daddy Jessup who keeps his daughter locked away in a barn and an assortment of other colorful characters played by actors whose faces probably look vaguely familiar if you watched TV in the 1970's.

The humor is silly and very hit or miss, but when Manchu Eagle Murder Caper Mystery is funny it's often genuinely hilarious.  At its best, the gags reminded me a lot of the type of humor you would see later in Airplane! and The Naked Gun.  I'm guessing that Dean Hargrove used friends from his TV shows in the crew because the look of Manchu Eagle Murder Mystery and its soundtrack is a perfect imitation of early 1970's Universal Television crime programs like Columbo, McCloud and McMillan and Wife.  But while it feels a lot like a TV mystery movie (and at 80 minutes is about the right length) some of the humor might not have gotten past network censors.  This is apparently a theatrically released film from United Artists, although I have no memory of it ever actually playing in theaters.  It's a shame the movie didn't find a wider audience back when it was made but great that it's so easy to find now.  This one's definitely worth discovering if you like silly comedy or are a fan of the kind of TV mysteries that it's having fun with.",1501718400,,2359,4.754901960784314
8491218,4,B0062KMEBU,"""The Manchu Eagle Murder Caper Mystery"" is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. I first saw a slightly edited version of this on UHF television as a kid. My very sensible mother watched part of it with me and summarized it with the very appropriate statement ""This is the craziest thing I've ever seen!"" She had a great sense of humor, but like most normal people had a hard time getting her head around some of the plot convolutions. I particularly remember her laughing at the climactic shootout, the scene I remember best as well. More on that later.

After all these years I thought this little gem of mid '70s filmmaking had probably vanished forever, but I was thrilled to be proven wrong when I found it on DVD. The DVD is a bare bones affair with no extras and chapter breaks every ten minutes, but that's a fine price to pay to get to see this again. The film stars Gabriel Dell as Malcolm (Dell also co-wrote it with director Dean Hargrove), a self-employed poultry engineer and part time private investigator with extremely minimal qualifications. Malcolm lives in a tiny desert town of 120 people, and is the premier poultry supplier to the town. He's heard the tale of the elusive Manchu Eagle and is on a quest to find its secrets; this is a quest that will bring danger and intrigue to the town in spades. The film is a parody of melodramatic brooding PI movies with insane leaps of logic, peculiar characters, all of which have entanglements, and features a central poultry narrative to tie everything together.

After beginning his day with a regimen of Japanese Air Force exercises, Malcolm has the first in a series of spats with his horrible bedridden wife Ida Mae (Joyce Van Patten), before losing a chicken to a hit and run driver (""It's the fourth hit and run chicken I've had this month!"") To put the intrigue in play, Malcolm goes to his office to meet with Oscar (Dick Gautier), the local milkman who is convinced someone is out to kill him. It turns out that Oscar is having a relationship with Arlevia Jessup (Anjanette Comer), the cloistered daughter of the biggest man in town, Big Daddy Jessup (Vincent Gardenia). Big Daddy and his horrible spiteful son Freddie (Howard Storm) keep Arlevia locked in a barn to prevent her dalliances, and Oscar has a reason to fear. While relating this to Malcolm, Oscar is killed by an arrow shot through the office window (""Oh, is this his arrow?"") and instead of calling the Sheriff (Jackie Coogan), Malcolm decides to investigate the case for himself.

The first step of the case involves the investigation of the murder of a goat named Susan, who was wearing frilly pajamas at the time of her death. Although apparently strangled by a pair of pantyhose, the Sheriff has another opinion: ""I think that the mascot OD'ed!"" The plot starts to coalesce when it turns out that Susan was last seen in the company of Oscar, and lived in the barn with Arlevia. If this is not all making sense now, rest assured the threads of the plot all converge in a most peculiar way at the end. For some expository backstory, Dr. Simpson (Will Geer) is consulted by Malcolm, but is his testimony trustworthy (he takes drugs in mass quantities) or is he a double-crosser? Through a very confusing series of steps, Malcolm finally solves the case leading to an astounding shootout in the barnyard with both Big Daddy Jessup and Freddie (who opts to bring a shovel to the gunfight). If there was any lingering confusion about what happened Malcolm explains it all thoroughly, though I will not spoil it here. I promise you will not forget this gunfight: it's the only one I have ever seen where not only do the people bleed when hit, so do fences posts, buildings, and cars. Also note the only windmill toppling disarmament in movie history (which made me laugh out loud).

In the end all the conspirators are brought to justice (you probably won't be able to predict the twist at the end for once), and there's a (very) brief romance at the hatchery that harkens back to a scene at the very beginning of the film, bringing it nicely full circle.

""The Manchu Eagle Murder Caper Mystery"" is not for everybody. It requires viewers to pay attention to keep up and has an extremely complex but darkly funny plot that will reward patient fans of the PI, mystery, comedy, satire, or spoof genres. I truly have never seen anything like it and am thrilled I found it again after all these years! I just wish I could've watched it with my Mom.",1485907200,2,4491,4.601747815230961

8491220,5,B0062KMEBU,"Great movie, arrived in new condition, as advertised.  This movie is timeless.  Some would say it's a ""cult classic"".  (I just don't know what cult it would belong in:))  It's very tongue-in-cheek with cliche phrases and characters throughout the movie.  Thoroughly enjoyable!",1410307200,3,276,5.476190476190476
8491221,1,B0062KMEBU,"Manchu Eagle Murder Mystery, 2007 film

It starts at a rural desert area. A man is questioned by the police. He starts to tell his story. He was at home with his wife in the morning. Her husband hoped to make it big, not just another failure. Can a chicken lay colored eggs with a picture inside? Ida Mae says this is another one of Malcolm's ridiculous schemes. He talks to Laverne, his chicken, until a speeding car passes by. He talks to Doc then about his new detective agency. A mail order course? Oscar says someone is trying to kill him! A rich man wants him to stay away from his daughter. Then a shot kills Oscar befoe he could pay his fee. The police arrive to process the crime scene.

By this time I realized watching this was a mistake. It takes a good story to make a good movie, this doesn't have one. It is difficult to meld comedy into a murder mystery. The ""Thin Man"" series had comic scenes but the stories were better.",1380499200,,938,4.264044943820225
8491222,4,B0062KMEBU,"A very entertaining, quirky, funny comedy-mystery. The picture quality is superb, the film is letterboxed, so either MGM/Warner did a careful restoration, or the film has been meticulously preserved all these years. I was expecting an inferior print, considering that the film is so obscure (don't even think it got a wide release). It's so refreshing to see the underappreciated Gabriel Dell (he also co-scripted) finally have a lead role, and he handles it with typical aplomb. Features a who's who of great 70's comic actors, including Jackie Coogan, Huntz Hall and Vincent Gardenia, all perfectly cast in their roles. The 80 minute running time breezes by, there isn't a wasted frame or moment, and the mystery aspect will certainly hold your interest. This is one film that deserves to have a cult following.",1324252800,12,813,5.074626865671642
