963846,2,6305103976,"Most of the reviewers of this movie seems to be looking for the original 36th Chamber of Shaolin. The problem with HK movies is that they have a lot of names. The original 36th Chamber of Shaolin is also known as Master  Killer. You can find all the AKA (also known as) names on the web site  ""Hong Kong Cinema"". I understand that Master Killer has been  re-released as Shaolin Master Killer (soon also on DVD!).",932169600,20,412,4.394736842105263
963847,1,6305103976,"I ordered this video hoping it was the original 36th chamber, but I was disappointed. This is just trying to make money on the Shawbrothers original 36th chamber. Its got lots of tiresome comedy, and is only  watchable for kids. Even kids might say its rubbish. If you order this, you  might want to get your money back.",916444800,,320,4.5
7882729,5,6305103976,Great movie and a must have for the collection!  And Gordon Liu was great again.  These are the films where his kung fu skills are brought out.,1396915200,,143,4.2592592592592595
7882730,1,6305103976,Don't wast your money buying this movie. It is not the 36th Chamber of Shaolin everyone wants. Buy Master Killer if you want the good version.,1124236800,,142,4.5
7882731,2,6305103976,"I'm a big fan of Gordon Liu, but this film is not one of his better one's.  He plays a young shaolin student who decides to take on the Ming General with the help of some volunteer students played by some of the stars of 5 Deadly Venoms (the toad).  The fights in the beginning are good, the training fights are also good, but there is definately too much talking, and the subtitles are hard to read.  If your a Gordon Liu collector you have to have this one, but dont' get fooled by the pics on the box, cause they don't appear in the film. An ok film though.  Plus Lo Liegh plays the talented bad guy.",987984000,2,603,4.084745762711864
7882732,1,6305103976,"As has been stated before, this video has absolutely nothing to do with the pictures on the box. Moreover, although Gordon Liu (who is usually very good) is listed as the star, he really only plays a minor role in this  film.
In addition, unless you speak Hong Kong Chinese, the subtitles are  virtually useless, since most of them fall off the ends of the screen in  this very poorly formatted rendition, and the movie is rather dark and  definitely has the quality of low-budget bootleg version (whether it is or  not.) This means that it's really hard to tell if the fight sequences are  any good most of the time, anyway.
The movie you should get is SHAOLIN  MASTER KILLER starring Gordon Liu. This was (I believe) originally released  in the U.S. as 36th Chamber of Shaolin. I am fortunate enough to live in  NYC (stop snickering), which has a number of Chinese movie houses in which  I saw that film originally and have seen many of these films in the  past.
If you really want to see this film, try to rent it. Don't waste  money on purchasing it. .....",969408000,17,1060,4.463541666666667
7882733,1,6305103976,I can't read the english subtitiles because they go offscreen and anyways they are on for like 1-3 seconds.  I can't speed read and pay attention to the action.  Also if you look on the back cover of the box then you will  notice that those pictures are from another movie!  What a bunch of  ripoff liers!  I wanted to buy the Shaolin Master Killer and not this  garbage!,956707200,3,371,4.2898550724637685
7882734,2,6305103976,This film is one of the worst martial films I've seen. Difinitely not what I expected. I was totally annoyed after the first 15 mins. It was like watching a Video CD. Subtitles were poor. And I fell asleep 3 or 4 times  during the film. And I love martial art films,938995200,4,265,4.096153846153846
