7561662,2,B0192PESJM,"I watched this with my 11 year old daughter and for the most part I thought it was good. But... There was one part on the movie that I was actually a little shocked. Whoopi Goldberg plays the 3 headed monkey queen and there is a part where she says she can't waste her guard monkeys and tells them to send the ""crackers"". I still didn't think anything of the ""cracker"" monkeys until they started to speak and they had southern white or what some might call redneck or hillbilly accents. It just made me think about what outrage there would be if instead of crackers they were called something else and had urban black accents. What do you think?",1460160000,16,645,4.383333333333334
7561692,4,B0192PESJM,"PPL looking too much into movies and how great they should look.  It is about being fun and we (educated, lol, 52,26,12 yr olds) liked this. Why?  We just did.  That is all that matters.  Has it's flaws but I am sure they did the best they could on a budget,  Not everyone has Millions to spend on movies.  Good story and nice ending.  KISS...Keep it Simple Stupid.

Then end......",1473120000,,381,4.3428571428571425

7561695,5,B0192PESJM,Watched this movie with my Grandsons! It was a great gift for movie night and they have watched it many times!,1469232000,,110,4.285714285714286
7561696,1,B0192PESJM,"This is the worst, most incoherent, poorly cast, feature animation I have ever seen in my life.  I find the 5 star reviews inconceivable.  It seems to have changed titles a few times ""Savva, Heart of a Warrior"", and ""A Warriors Tail""  are other titles it has gone by.  You can watch it for free on that other streaming service, but I advise you not to.",1467331200,,352,4.287878787878788
7561697,2,B0192PESJM,"Even for a simple kids movie this was not good.

The plot tried to do too much, and so each aspect of it was poorly done.  The relationships between the characters are thin at best, with nothing bringing them together beyond proximity. What should be a simple story of a young boy finding the strength in himself is convoluted with too much subplot, cliches, and attempts at cheesy humor that fall flat.

Near the end of the film is what is meant to be the emotional moment where the boy learns he had the strength within him all the time, but as he already starts out as a brave kid, and doesn't really face any exceptional challenges on his journey, this moment is cheapened, even more so by the fact that it is cliche and the viewer knows exactly what is going to happen when the mage sends him through the door to find the ""warrior.""

As another reviewer mentioned, Savva gets very upset when he learns the wolf's true identity, when the two haven't known each other long and haven't really built any kind of relationship. It makes the scene at the end of the movie where they run to each other through a field of flowers seem almost comedic rather than heartfelt. The same goes with the girl who falls for Savva after a couple of pointed glances and weak smiles, and the relationship at the end of the film between the Baron and the pink fluff, despite the fact that no real bonding has ever happened between any of these characters.

The only aspect I found interesting that I would have rather the movie focused on, was the curse on the white wolves. I can almost picture an entirely different movie on my head, focused on the Wolf as he tries to cure his people of the curse brought on by his father's actions. That is something worth exploring, but it flashes past in an instant and isn't given the time it needs to really develop.

The accents in this movie are horrendous. The strange young girl (the only person in her clan/kingdom that looks human among a race of kind of...goblin-looking-things) has a horrible rendition of a southern bayou accent that made me cringe every time she called Savva ""Cher.""

The animation isn't amazing, the figures move stiffly, especially when they run, and any skin looks like molded plastic. Often the voice acting doesn't match up with the character's mouths, and their faces lack any definition of subtle emotions. This is very lackluster animation for something from 2015, it looks worse than Toy Story 1, which was an amazing movie and came out over 20 years ago!  In an age when computer graphics can create things like Avatar, and the new Warcraft movie, graphics this bad are almost in-excusable.

I also don't see how this could be a good and educational movie for children. The only promising themethat of believing in yourselfis weakly presented. Savva behaves like a brave boy, but he doesn't really change or grow in the movie, he doesn't overcome obstacles that require believing in himself. And the accents and imitations of certain groups of people are bordering on insulting.

All in all this movie was a big disappointment, considering the impressive voice-cast for a low-budget movie it is still that, a poor quality low-budget movie.",1467331200,2,3200,4.66785079928952
7561698,4,B0192PESJM,"While the story is pretty darn corny, and there are plenty of strange plot holes, it's actually still kinda cute to look at, and the graphics are a nice visual treat for the family.",1467158400,,181,4.352941176470588
7561699,5,B0192PESJM,The movie is entertaining as well as educational for all ages.  Whoopi Goldberg 's line was meant to educate not promote racism.  Whoopi stands for equality which is why she recited the line.  Did it not make you think?  I quite enjoyed the show,1466121600,,245,4.5
7561700,1,B0192PESJM,"This movie was horribly written. The plot is so thin I'm surprised it held together. For example, the young main character travels with a wolf for a couple of days and when he finds out the wolf lied about his identity he becomes distraught because he ""TRUSTED him and thought he was his best friend."" For real? After two days of knowing a stranger? They hadn't even gone through hardly any trials together at this point. Oh, and a shaman's 10 year granddaughter falls in love with the main character after one look and ten words so OF COURSE she would leave her entire family, go into battle, and move in with the boy. Really? And what is with her Cajun accent?

I was surprised to see all the big names attached to this piece of garbage. Save your money and time for a well-written, well-done Disney or Pixar movie.",1466121600,,817,4.446666666666666

7561712,5,B0192PESJM,"This is a highly creative, family-friendly film with a great message.  My wife and I watched it with our two little ones (7 and 9) and they were glued to the screen.  They've seen pretty much every animated ""kid's film"" at this point but they were really drawn to this one, and have watched it a lot since.  Sweeping story, good animation, and a great message for kids: trust yourself, and stand up for what you know is right.  Highly recommended.",1465862400,,447,4.481481481481482
7561713,5,B0192PESJM,"I really enjoy this movie. Its a tale of a small boy trying to save his village and mother. Along the way make life long friends, and to discover the magician. You learn of each characters back story along the course of the movie. Seems that only reason people are giving this movie a low rating cause of one line in the movie. Which is small and not even worth bring up. Some of the animation is a bit fuzzy. One song that didn't need to be in there. But over all for a small budget movie it's not bad. I recommend this movie i have two small children and they love it.",1465689600,,570,4.053097345132743
7561714,1,B0192PESJM,"Agree with other viewers on being shocked while watching this movie with MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. For someone like Whoopi who is so openly against racism I'm ""surprised"" that she would let the ""crackers"" line be associated with her character. I'm not one to get up in arms over these things nor am I one to write a review on amazon but in a child's movie..really? Beware parents, undertone of racism not even hidden but blatantly obvious. I even called netflix about the content.",1465603200,2,478,4.635294117647059
7561715,1,B0192PESJM,"""Crackers"" really!!! The leftest media would be outraged if a white southern actress said bring me the savages. Very obviously meant to inflame. This is a Russian movie that was produced to anger people.",1464912000,,203,5.0
7561716,5,B0192PESJM,"I can tell that there wasn't a high budget for this movie, and there are some scenes (by that I mean a particularly cringe worthy song) in it that just don't fit well, but I love everything else about it. I may be bias because it has a beautiful white wolf in it, and wolves just so happen to be my favorite animal. But this is an enjoyable movie that can surprise you if you give it a chance.",1464825600,3,393,3.9873417721518987

7561718,3,B0192PESJM,"This movie was decent it kept entertained enough to watch it all the way through. Some reviews on here are calling it racist I honestly don't think it is, well minus that one part where the monkey queen summons the cracker monkeys and speak in a southern accent ' Also the voice actress who played the princess did not suit the character, well in my opinion.
I didn't like that the villains were monkeys. Like monkeys menacing really? Well in the end this movie was a great distraction animation was ok nothing spectacular. It made me chuckle a couple of times. So rent this movie and give it a try I bought it, but I think it's more of a rental for family night. Also milla jovovich does a good job as savva.",1463184000,,709,4.338345864661654
7561719,4,B0192PESJM,This movie was very entertaining. The characters are cute and funny. I think some of the adults are reading too much into things that aren't really there. I'm a black woman and I did not pick up on any racist innuendos. There is no content that would be inappropriate for children.,1462579200,6,281,4.529411764705882

7561721,1,B0192PESJM,"Wow... This is so bad my two kids asked me to turn it off. That has never happened before. I was watching with them. I could not quite put my finger on it but the movie seemed to have a ulterior motive. It seems vaguely racist in a way I can not describe. It seems to imply that if someone / something is different than that is a bad thing, something to be shunned. Granted I only watched the first 45 minutes before shutting it down.

Some of the bad guys are blue and yellow punk rock looking Hyenas. Why? Nothing else in the movie was that brightly discolored.",1461542400,,563,4.165137614678899

8743667,5,B0192PESJM,"I was quite amazed and pleasantly surprised by this movie. It is very well done, has an interesting story, beautifully designed landscapes and creatures, good music, good humor. Remarkably, it is a Russian movie which was originally made in 3D. There is a lot of talent in Russia. Too bad it was not released on 3D blu-Ray for the US market. Fun to watch for adults and kids. Hyenas are a tiny bit scary in the beginning, but after the first 10 mins, it is all fun, positive and humorous. Highly recommended.",1491091200,,508,4.532608695652174
