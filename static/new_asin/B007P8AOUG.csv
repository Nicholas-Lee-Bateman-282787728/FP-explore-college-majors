Perhaps other than Peter Bogdanovich , McBride is my favorite, and like Peter he knew and interviewed many legends before their passing.  This is an interesting 50 minutes IF you are interested already in Mr McBride so I'll say it will be limited for most potential viewers.  I'd like to give it 5 stars but the production values are substandard.  The display is very grainy/low resolution, which simply should not be the case for something filmed so recently.... but other than those marginally amateurish production values , for me , the content was very worthwhile.",1436313600,2,627,4.942857142857143
