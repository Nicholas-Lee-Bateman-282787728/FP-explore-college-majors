3823589,4,B001VSPYPQ,"I was able to find this ""beaut"" on line, it was VERY hard to track down in stores -
this version gives all of the first 5 movies a good look inside one case, then has a cool looking picture on the front (if you jigsaw fans know what I mean).

3823601,5,B001VSPYPQ,"excellent choice for those that like a lot of blood and keeps you on edge from beginning to end. The endings and flashbacks are really unexpected, I would explain in details some of the things that happen during a series but that would spoil the fun. Not For Children Under 18 or for people that do not like to see a lot ""blood, guts, and other human pain"".
Again, if you are watching these for the first time and think you have the ending figured out, you will be wrong!
The Series runs in a first to last type deal where each one left off, in other words its best to start from the first series and go on to the next and so on until the final one. If you skip one series there are flash backs to the previous one, but if you are not paying attention you will get really frustrated.
Nice casting, illusions, and sound effects along with some very good acting.
Happy Viewing and Sweet Dreams!",1425081600,2,892,4.222222222222222

3823608,5,B001VSPYPQ,I love the originality of these movies and how they show the changes in Jigsaw's agenda with the various traps. Tobin Bell was perfect for John. I have seen these movies many times. Each time is better than the previous viewing.,1405900800,2,228,4.585365853658536
3823609,5,B001VSPYPQ,I really enjoyed this collection. The mystery makes it good to me. The first movie and third movie are the best.,1404518400,,112,4.380952380952381
3823610,5,B001VSPYPQ,"When I received this in the mail, I initially gave it a low rating because it was damaged in shipping.  The disks were ok, but the case was damaged, and I didn't want to deal with a return and all that mess, so I just gave it a low rating and went on with my day.  The next day I got an email from Books By Tammy asking how they could fix the issue.  Thinking this was just some automated message, I ignored it.  Then about a week later, I got a second email to the same affect.  At this point I responded... The details of our deal are not so terribly important here, but I have to say, I've not worked with a customer service rep for any company who worked as hard to correct a problem for a long time.  I was amazed by how well Books By Tammy treated me as a customer.
Thanx Books By Tammy!  Truly a leader in the market place!  There are some companies I've sworn off forever because of bad customer service, but you are the first I've ever actually desired to work with more in the future because of good customer service!",1401926400,,1027,4.074626865671642

I was very happy when I found the set on here, and at a very decent price. The delivery was quick and the DVDs themselves came in very good condition. Only a smudge here and there, but easily fixed with a cloth. The features are enjoyable as well.
I'd recommend this boxset to the fans of these movies.",1335830400,,420,4.134146341463414

3823652,5,B001VSPYPQ,"Obviously this is no longer the ""complete"" collection, but as long as you understand that this is only the first five movies, it is well worth getting! These are wonderful movies. I do not enjoy most horror films because they don't really seem to have any point except to disgust and scare you. The Saw series goes much beyond that. I love that these movies actually make you think!",1323302400,5,382,4.550724637681159

8346744,5,B001VSPYPQ,What can you say.  ITS A BLOODY MOVIE and one of its own.  This its 5 of them and I bought the last one (Saw VI) so I have the entire series.  This is the best way to watch SAW because it all happens within a small period of time.  When they show them at the movies it leaves a lot of unanswered questions and because of the time frame between the movies it can be very confusing.  I am well known for owning Horror movies and this is one that I am constantly lending.,1467072000,,468,3.8842105263157896
