933265,2,6304718756,"This DVD was no my recommended list because I'd bought Baraka.  But that's probably the best reason for not buying it - if you've seen Baraka or movies of its quality you'll be badly disappointed by this one.  Its too bad because I really wanted to like it...
Earthscapes has no theme other than mostly timelapse filmed landscapes with endless clouds rushing by.  As ""A Viewer"" pointed out, the landscapes may be beautiful but it is far from relaxing.  Earthscapes has a less than quality soundtrack that does nothing to improve the otherwise disconnected film sequences.
If I had an LCD projector I'd probably throw this movie up on the wall once in a while with some of my own more appropriate music dubbed over it but otherwise I think its going to collect dust.",1013212800,12,765,4.644444444444445
933266,4,6304718756,"If you love time-lapse photography, this is a surreal and mesmerizing experience-truly a piece of art & beauty.  The music is wonderful making it a stimulating music video of nature, light, and weather.  If you like Earthscapes, or just want a more relaxing and 'natural' experience, check out 'virtual' seascapes with award winning ""Hawaiian Dreams."" Unlike, Earthscapes, it captures only the natural sights and sounds of the sea without music or quick editing.  Both of these DVDs are spectacular!",1008028800,7,499,5.291139240506329
933267,3,6304718756,"This isn't a bad DVD by any means. It's the sort of thing to put on in the background, for atmospherics when you're talking or reading or whatever. The photography is nice enough and the locations are pretty, but if you've seen films like Baraka or Koyaanisqatsi, then you're probably better off not bothering with this. It's not in the same league. Just my opinion.",997747200,6,366,4.6461538461538465
933268,5,6304718756,"This was done by David Fortney, a master of time-lapse photography and is a technical tour de force.  The music fits-in very well, but I often will just let it play as a moving artwork.  Someone else claimed the video quality was bad, but I suspect a faulty player - it looks great on mine !  If you like video as artwork, check out ""Canyon Dreams"" and ""True North"", both on the Miramar label.",983750400,14,393,4.283783783783784
933269,1,6304718756,"The photography is fabulous and scenery is great...but thats about all it has going for it.  The main problem here is the video quality.  How  much trouble is it do put great quality video on a dvd?????  I mean, this dvd needs it most because of the great scenery.  The whole purpose of a dvd is vivid picture and sound, but this one fails radically, it looks like a highly compressed video one could download off the internet!  Ten bucks down the drain....",978134400,7,457,4.445783132530121
933270,5,6304718756,"This award winning film is full of beautifully shot time lapse photography of incredible scenery. It has a pleasant instrumental soudtrack with no narration.
It is extremly relaxing to watch, and is an absolute bargain at the price. Definately recommended for all nature lovers.",975024000,9,278,5.340909090909091
933271,3,6304718756,"The ultimate in relaxation / background images & music. Watch weather patterns shift over some of the USA''s most beautiful & timeless landscapes including Monument valley, The Canadian Rockies, winter  landscapes of the high desert etc etc etc.",963705600,5,245,5.447368421052632
933272,5,6304718756,"This DVD is one of the most relaxing, stress reducing videos I have ever seen.  The time lapsed cinematogrophy is nothing short of amazing.  The visual effect is soothing and calming.  I felt like I could just float  away.  The sounds will take you away from all the stress and deliver you to  a higher plane.  This DVD is a must see.  I have seen most of Mr. Fortney's  previous work and this project delivers the same high quality photography  and amazing sounds.",948585600,9,465,4.493975903614458
933273,5,6304718756,Amazing and unbelievably beautiful cinematography! I LOVED this latest addition to Fortney's long list of impressive work.,948240000,3,122,6.235294117647059
933274,5,6304718756,I have never seen a video as breathtaking as this. The use of Tangerine Dream musically was a stroke of genius. Have seen David's other work and this is up there with some of his other projects. Hope to see more of him  in the future.,948240000,9,234,4.086956521739131
7878109,5,6304718756,"Great film. I use it for relaxation training to introduce visual imagery as a technique to be used when needing to create a ""safe place"" for relaxation.",1492905600,,152,4.666666666666667
7878110,5,6304718756,"Very engaging soundtrack, beautiful video.",1454025600,,42,7.6
7878111,5,6304718756,"This is a great musical CD.  I've replaced it 3 times over the years. It's one of the best easy listening albums I've heard.  I give the music 5 stars.  The film or video isn't of equal quality.

It was filmed many years ago and probably would have been much better if produced today.  It doesn't bother me, but I give the visual production 3 1/2 stars.  Overall I'm not going to average these two components, but give this CD 5 stars for the music, since it's some of my favorite. I guess you could say this is a qualifying internal review, not fully reflected in the above featured stars. I'll leave this viewpoint up to you.",1438041600,,627,4.316239316239316
7878112,5,6304718756,"My favorite track on the planet is the #3 track, shown as #2 on the Menu. It has an angelic sound to the most beautiful music I know. I am AMAZED as the negative comments here. Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I view them as suspicious, possibly jealous competitors.

Maybe they would like rap, or Hip Hop better.  We didn't have HD 20 years ago.  I get good quality on my monitor for this video. Maybe they have HD eyes to see what I can't. I'm sure my option will seem offensive to you critiques, but there is definitely something wrong with the few offering such critical, and negative reviews here. A hidden agenda?",1420675200,,640,4.452991452991453
7878113,3,6304718756,I picked this DVD up to use for a relaxing escape in the comfort of my own home.  The quality is good but I was not a fan of the background music and sound effects as part of the soundtrack.  If you turn the volume down and play your own music then it's not a problem.  I'd recommend this DVD but I believe something like Hawaiian Dreams: Waves DVD is a bit better.,1387324800,,365,3.9726027397260273
7878114,3,6304718756,"This is a good DVD with wonderful landscape photography from various US national parks. However, the playtime is way too short. The DVD is only about 37 minutes long. I would think it should run at least 60 minutes long. Some close-up photography are somewhat cliche which I think the producer is trying to add more minutes to the content. I also think most of these are edited from stock photography rather than the producer set out to capture the content for the DVD which is why it is a shame it's too short.",1324425600,,511,4.446808510638298
7878115,5,6304718756,"I've seen this DVD countless times on American Airlines trips, it is played while the boarding process goes on. This is so unique that I had to have a copy for my collection. I can only describe it as a moving mural with soothing music. Whenever I need to unwind after a tense day at the office, or on the road, this helps. It leaves me with a strange emotion where on one hand I feel so tiny and powerless in the universe, and at the same time I feel excited and joyful about simply being alive. Words like this don't come easy for me, but this is the reaction I have to these images. Thanks David Fortney! Well done!",1078099200,7,618,4.158333333333333
7878116,5,6304718756,"I've found that Enya's ""A Day Without Rain"" album goes beautifully with this DVD....  make sure to turn the volume down on the television, the volume up on the stereo, Enya's on repeat (the entire album), and sync the video and the music to start as if you've already prepared and played both, pausing the album to start at the first track after stopping the video to press play at the same time (Miramar sequence should be seen first with the music)  if anyone has any more great videos or music to share or would like to know other music/video combinations I've enjoyed, please write me.....  thanks",1022371200,8,601,4.598130841121495
7878117,2,6304718756,"This project feels like an attempt at a ""Baraka"" knockoff. Unfortunately it's a rather feeble attempt. Although a lot of the images are undeniably beautiful, they are frequently marred by poor editing: camera bumps, abrupt fade outs, digital noise in places and overuse of filter type effects which lend many scenes an odd artificiality ala ""What Dreams May Come"". Also as another reviewer points out, the snappy pace of the constantly scudding clouds is more like an MTV music video than a meditation on Nature's serene beauty. What really mars the whole experience is the incredibly insipid music by Suzanne Cianni and Patrick O'Hearn. I'm afraid it's New Age music at its worst (I don't hate all New Age stuf,f BTW) with banal melodies, shopworn chord progressions and unrelentingly cheesy synthesized textures guaranteed to kill off brain cells as you listen.
Not recommended except in cases of recent brain surgery.",1018828800,29,920,5.14
7878118,1,6304718756,"I'd just been watching Chronos by Ron Fricke, which is excellent, then played this back to back. It just doesn't stand up. The images themselves are fine, but there are too many things that are wrong. The way the camera pans across the landscape is horrible, very mechanical, makes you feel like a robot. Then the editing is just plain bad, cuts happen with absolutely no feel for the music that is happening underneath.
I managed to last thru the first five minutes and it was like someone scratching their nails down a chalkboard.",1017792000,7,532,4.670212765957447
