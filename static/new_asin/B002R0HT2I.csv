3970816,5,B002R0HT2I,1/Fila is the best album of Thalia since 2002. She shows that she can really sing and demonstrates her diapason. I wish she could give some concerts live as it's  my dream to see her and enjoy her music.,1266105600,,203,4.205128205128205
3970817,5,B002R0HT2I,"I have been a big fan of Thalia since I first seen the ""Mujer Latina"" video quite a few years ago. This album is a big change from the more commercial pop she has been doing recently.
The album is very intimate and natural. The choice of songs are excellent. I especially loved the duet with Pedro Capo ""Estoy Enanorado"". Gives me goosebumbs but also the need to sing along at the same time. This album is a must for Thalia fans. For those of who are not fans this is a very good DVD to start your collection. Thank you thalia for this beautiful album.",1265328000,,552,4.216981132075472
3970818,5,B002R0HT2I,"I've got to admit that I'm not a fan of some of Thalia's her earlier songs, but ""Primera Fila"" is without a doubt her best work so far.  Every song on the CD / DVD is outstanding.  The DVD is especially enjoyable since it captures her personality and her vitality.  If ""Primera Fila"" doesn't earn her a Latin Grammy award, the Grammy will lose all credibility with me.

The CD and DVD that are widely available do not have ""Ay Amor.""  A limited ""bonus"" edition of the CD/DVD being sold by Wal-Mart has ""Ay Amor""; however, the Wal-Mart ""bonus"" CD/DVD doesn't have all the other videos so it really isn't a good deal or a real ""bonus"".

If you want the song ""Ay Amor"", it can be purchased as an MP3 download on Amazon.

If you want to see the ""Ay Amor"" video, you can sometimes find it on YouTube; however, YouTube deletes it for copyright infringement so you have to be quick and lucky to find it.  I found it and was able to download it to my computer and iPod.",1265155200,,961,4.241758241758242
3970819,5,B002R0HT2I,"Thalia shows a whole different side of herself.  She is fabulous as a singer, with an excellent choice of songs, and also good choices with her duets.  Very, very well done.  Thalia has never been better.  Love this DVD.",1262995200,,220,4.564102564102564
3970820,5,B002R0HT2I,"Excelente musical de Thalia, todos los temas son espectaculares, vale la pena son muy buenas todas las canciones un trabajo muy profesional como slo ella sabe hacerlo! Lo recomiendo al 100%",1262390400,,189,5.129032258064516
3970821,5,B002R0HT2I,This is Thalia's first live concert DVD and I think everybody should watch this dvd because this is amazing... don't miss :),1262131200,,124,4.681818181818182
3970822,5,B002R0HT2I,"It is amazing the thrill you get when you are watching the concert and feeling each lyrics of her songs. She may not have one of the most powerfull voices in music, but she definitely manages to perform all the songs with well-worked notes. On top of that, the music band is wonderful. They are all great musicians. The chords are quite good. Perhaps, it is the best Latin album in 2009 (sorry for Shakira or Nelly Furtado, they did not achieve it), a real Latin pop album with great musicians (not with 'cheap' chords like the others I have mentioned). You did it, Thala. I have been waiting for a CD/DVD like this one for many years because I knew she could sing quite well and I was not 'wrong'. This concert is magical and she manages to convey such magnificent feelings through her beautiful voice. She does not need to have a powerful voice, it is brilliant just as it is, full of different nuances. Congratulations Thala! You have showed you are a great artist, much better than many people think.",1261526400,,1004,4.491803278688525
3970823,5,B002R0HT2I,"Thala edicin madura, definitivamente!!! Yo siempre he credo que canta, me gusta desde Timbiriche, pero este es el mejor CD/DVD que ha hecho. Me encanta ver como se ha superado musicalmente, sus interpretaciones llegan al corazn, logra transmitir ese sentimiento que se ve que le agrega a todas las letras. El que no es fan de Thala, con esta nueva produccin va a empezar a apreciar su talento.",1260748800,5,393,4.794117647058823
3970824,5,B002R0HT2I,"There are so many Latina singers, who stay in the realm of bad trumpets, silly beats, undersized dresses ....instead, now we have a beautiful woman, who looks like Diane Lane ('nuff said) on a warm summery day.  She can really sing, but more importantly she has a wonderful arrangement on each of her songs.  The sound is great, her narrations are heartfelt and short.
This is a DVD I've loved since I got it, and I don't speak a word of Spanish.
Go Girl!!---you really are above the rest!

3970861,5,B002R0HT2I,"This blu ray is just one of those that blows you away, I expected it to be good, but it was just awesome! Thalia comes out and right away you realize that the sound is great, perfectly mixed, the video image is amazing and her performance is a hit! Congratulations on this one, great job to all. Part of my surprise was that I did not remember Thalia to sing so well, popish type of stuff, but while she does not have a huge vocal range, she is awesome and does an amazing job.
If you like Thalia, even a little bit, you will love this blu ray.

Que hermosa mujer, su voz, la musica, la orquesta, que imagen tan clara en el video, la verdad me quede sorprendido con este producto. Thalia canta mucho mejor de lo que you me acuerdo, una gran artista. Les recomiendo este blu ray!",1352073600,,778,4.1866666666666665

3970863,5,B002R0HT2I,"I was not a fan of Thalia, but after I watched this concert, I fell in love with her voice. The concert is excellent. She invites several other singers who are great singers as well. 100% recommended. I also bought the other cds of ""Primera Fila"" and all of them are amazing. Excellent production.",1327708800,,297,4.518518518518518
3970864,5,B002R0HT2I,No words can describe how amazing this Live DVD is. Thalia is such a powerful and talented singer and artist in general. This is undeniable the best Live DVD and Album of the decade. <3 Strongly recommend it.,1325635200,,208,4.5
3970875,1,B002R0HT2I,"Thalia is a wonderful singer and this should be a great concert but it is mixed WAY TOO LOUD!!!  She has some very tallented musicians but all I hear is a WALL OF NOISE behind her.  There is no detail or definition in the music.  Even the ballads sound harsh.  I can understand (but not like) a sound engineer brick-walling a song for radio, but it should never, ever be done to a blu-ray.  There is simply no excuse for making a blu-ray sound this horrible.",1292803200,5,458,4.27906976744186
3970876,5,B002R0HT2I,"this young womanreally amazed me , she puts so much feeling into her singing and i feel that she also wants to satisfy the audience as much as possible . let me now say this, i endeavour to find dvd's especially blu-ray of singers and musicians from different nations, like SHAKIRA, MARC ANTHONY, RICKY MARTIN, MARIA RITA, CELTIC THUNDER and CELTIC WOMAN and the list goes on and on, mainly because they ae very gifted people, i wish sometimes that i could be in there shoes, it  must be a very nice feeling to know you are appreciated right through out the world. so back to thalia, i got right off track din't i . the concert was fabulous, the sound was great andthe picture was perfect, another young lady with a show of equal dedication to give her all to her audience is JULIETA VENEGAS i think she is a beautiful singer and an excellent muscian, so that why i really dig watching all these people over on the other side of our planet and i hope others have the same thoughts and feelings",1291420800,,993,4.367567567567567

3970881,5,B002R0HT2I,"With that incredable DVD Thalia is offering an adventure to all our sentences. She has turned into a real good singer now. On that DVD she is a very nice person and warms up my heart when I'm listening to it again and again!
A great performance without all the glimmer others are using. She is just herself - a warm and hearty person. And the songs are just great!

3970884,5,B002R0HT2I,"You will be thrilled by the performance, the songs's liveliness, and of course the intimacy of Thalia. In the documentary part, John Sebastian says that he wrote the song ""Con la Duda"" (With a Doubt) inspiring by the fact that some people's inquiring whether Thalia really sings or she is just a studio singer (since she did playbacks mostly on shows). He then contuniues that this live album will be a good answer to them. Thalia shows that she is a real, strong singer, without studio programmings or effects. She also says that by this album, Thalia went back to her roots meaninig that her singings in her childhood and her early career.
First single Equivocada, in every time you listen, makes you feel something new. Recently released second single Que Sera de Ti hits radio stations now. A personal song Como and Con la Duda can be excellent choices for next singles. Also the musical instruments in album and each songs are great!.
Thalia shows that how she lived with music, what music meant to her and she is really a star. She deserves a bow. Thank you Thalia, for this masterpiece!",1267056000,,1093,4.668393782383419

I guess it pays off to be married to the boss of Sony Music.. :-) .I said that, for there is no words to describe the quality of the audio-video of this work.. It is the first time that I have listened to PCM 5.1 encoding, and it blows me away every time that I play this bluray. I wish every mayor production had Uncompressed PCM 5.1.. Or PCM 7.1 as a choice... HD Master Audio (Dolby or DTS) very good but not as good as PCM 5.1... My two cents.",1419292800,,591,4.147826086956521
