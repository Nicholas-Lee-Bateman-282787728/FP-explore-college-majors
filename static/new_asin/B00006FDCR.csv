1745831,5,B00006FDCR,"I am very anxious about the release of this set.  I've been a huge fan of South Park ever since its debut.  Although I currently own the first season in the form of the VHS collection (2 episodes per tape), it'll be nice to be able to own every episode in chronological order.  From what I've heard, the show's creators will be providing optional commentary for each episode which will give us insight to how each came to be.
Here are the 13 episodes from the first episode in chronological order:
1.  CARTMAN GETS AN ANAL PROBE
2.  BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY BOAT RIDE
3.  VOLCANO
4.  WEIGHT GAIN 4000
5.  AN ELEPHANT MAKES LOVE TO A PIG
6.  DEATH
7.  PINKEYE
8.  DAMIEN
9.  STARVIN' MARVIN
10. MR. HANKEY THE CHRISTMAS POO
11. TOM'S RHINOPLASTY
12. MECHA STREISAND
13. CARTMAN'S MOM IS A DIRTY SLUT
Although there are very few details about what extras are contained in the set, I can only hope that the episodes themselves are uncensored.  That would be the best.",1026950400,27,960,4.386363636363637
1745883,5,B00006FDCR,"wonderful show and you can see where they started off as the funniest show back in the late 90's before they got political driven and more main stream events, this season comes with all the original classic episodes from the iconic 1st season and they do include the matt and trey jokes from the original VHS release and the DVD first run, also from what im seeing aside the first episode these are in widescreen format which is a change from the 4:3 airing of this season and looks excellent, also there is a disclamer before you even get to the main menu of the discs stating that these episodes are the way they aired with the bleeps with that in mind im wondering if the remaining 10 seasons prior to the first Blu-ray releases will come without the bleep tracks but honestly I think the bleeps add to the humor of this season and can stay right where they are plus if you don't know who these 4 foul mouthed 3rd graders are then you were born way after this show came to be, not safe for kids, so parents lets be responsible to that",1515369600,,1037,4.295918367346939

1745885,3,B00006FDCR,"The main problem i have, is that the creators of the show have some stupid chat before each episode. Other than that it's cool",1513382400,,126,4.291666666666667
1745886,5,B00006FDCR,"I see all the reviews are old and not for the blue ray edition, so let me be the first one to review the product listed which is the blue ray release.  Yes it easily gets 5 stars.  I was torn at first as to whether or not to get the first seasons of south park on blue ray or not and  I am glad I did.  To answer questions 1. Picture and animation quality is much improved on blue ray then the original on DVD or on TV way back when.  2.  The full length non edited fireside chats with mat stone and trey parker are back and included on blue ray each one a little longer than the originals and funnier then hell.  3. All episodes are non edited to show the original episodes as to how they were meant to be seen or extended the new scenes and subtle changes make these classics funnier and more classic then ever.  4.  now to answer the biggest question for people NO SEASON 1 EPISODES ARE NOT UNCENSORED the older episodes this early on did not have the technology to change or restore the audio, so as the creators state on the discs this is how they will stay forever, which really doesn't take anything away from it.  But good news fans continuing on ONLY PART OF SEASON 2 WILL STILL BE CENSORED THE REST OF SEASON 2 AND ALL THE OTHER NEW EARLY SEASONS OF SOUTH PARK JUST RELEASED ON BLUE RAY ARE UNCENSORED, AS CARTMAN WOULD SAY, THAT KICKS ASS .  So I hope this answers some of your questions, and this will forever be one of the all time classic animated comedies of all time.  ENJOY.",1513123200,2,1491,4.1211072664359865

1745963,3,B00006FDCR,"I love south park, honestly. But I have problems with the set. For one, Trey and Matt introduce every episode. At first it was funny, but then after the 10th one you watch and there's almost no difference between them until there's a new setting, they lose the humor. The episodes are funny. That's really my only problem",1480377600,,321,4.551724137931035

1745966,5,B00006FDCR,In my opinion South Park is one of the best comedy shows ever made.  I will say though that this first season on DVD has a really not awesome transfer.  5 out of 5 because it's still South Park and it's still awesome.  Each episode has an introduction by Matt and Trey.  Just buy it.  Do it.  DO IT!!!!,1476057600,3,302,4.033898305084746

1746015,5,B00006FDCR,"This is where Trey and Matt started and it deserves no less than 5 stars because South Park Season 1 is a very unique season. Future seasons would recapture some of the wacky, strange, offbeat humor found here but this is definitely one of a kind in the South Park universe of seasons. It establishes the characters and touches on social issues some but is just offbeat and weird which makes it that much more funny. Moreover, Trey and Matt's introductions to episodes are GREAT in their own right! I'll rank each episode:
Cartman Gets an Anal Probe- 4/5 Not a bad start but not the best episode
Volcano- 5/5 This is where the offbeat humor and hilarious strangeness starts more.
Weight Gain 4000- 5/5 Another classic like Volcano
Big Gay Al's Boat Ride- 5/5 Controversial for back then but is still great today
Elephant Makes Love to a Pig- 5/5 This is a prime example of the strange offbeat humor propelling an episode to greatness.
Death- 5/5 We meet Stan's silly grandpa and Terrence and Phillip here and again magic
Pinkeye- 5/5 Halloween special that kills
Starvin Marvin- 5/5 One of my favorite episodes from this season, the Thanksgiving special
Mr. Hankey- 5/5 Definitely a classic and highlight of this season.
Damien- 5/5 This is a personal favorite; controversial yet hilarious take on religion
Tom's Rhinoplasty- 5/5 Odd and offbeat but again somehow is great
Mecha Streisand- 5/5 One of the best examples of their use of offbeat humor with great comedy. And Robert Smithfrom The Cure of course.
Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut- 4/5 The follow-up in Season 2 I think is superior to this cliffhanger but it's still a great one.
In short, a must have for any South Park fan. I grew up on these episodes and they are still fresh to this day in my opinion. For fans of funny animated satire like comedy, definitely check it out!",1469491200,,1835,4.666666666666667

These idiots force their very UNFUNNY non animated selves on every episode. And I see they did it to season 2 as well. Unwatchable with these idiots interrupting EVERY episode to do I don't even know what other than waste our time as viewers and to completely ruin the viewing experience. There is no way to skip the ""intros"" to every episode either. So disappointing and I'll not waste any more money on their products. I like the shows, I despise the creators.

1746154,4,B00006FDCR,"Most collected television seasons of various series I've purchased contain some flimsy ""behind the scenes"" E!-like fluff, but South Park contains anything but. While I was disappointed that it didn't contain the conventional voice-over commentary, the two have a faux introduction for each episode, which include a fireside chat, a western kid's show, and a retirement community show. These introductions have a *little* behind-the-scenes Q&A, but mostly expose us to Matt and Trey humor beyond that of South Park. If you've only seen the two through their South Park episodes, you'll hopefully find a favorite here. My own is the western kid's show introduction where they talk about Natasha Hendridge and long lonely nights.

The extras also contain two short animated music videos, ""O Holy Night"", where Cartman gets hit with a cattle prod when he misses a word, and *Ned* singing ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"". The boys also present a winner in the 1997 Cable ACE Award in a short piece of anim... Read more",1447286400,,1010,5.047904191616767
1746155,5,B00006FDCR,"A fantastic start to a fantastic show. I'll always love the first season because it had a simplicity that's refreshing compared to later seasons that focus on heavy-handed moral teachings and big news stories.

Now, this is a message to the person who complained that South Park is too vulgar for a children's show. Here's a bit of reality for you: this is in no way a children's show, and in no way was it ever billed as one. Just because a show is animated does NOT mean it is for children; flush that idea from your brain. If you were a responsible parent, you would have noticed the ""Mature Audiences"" TV-MA rating. There is even a disclaimer at the beginning of every episode telling the viewer it's an incredibly mature show intended only for adults. What happened to the days when parents took responsibility for their own children and didn't rely on the entertainment industry to babysit them by making sure every show on television is appropriate for children under the age of 8?",1447027200,,988,4.645714285714286

1746417,2,B00006FDCR,"When you're a kid and teenager you like stupid immature crap (Excluding Beavis and Butthead, because I still have some love for it). South Park is one of those crude and stupid shows, like Family Guy, American Dad, Robot Chicken, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, not to say I hate all those, I'm just naming examples. I use to like this show, but I don't know why, it is crude just to be crude and how it got so many seasons is beyond me, it should never have went past one. It isn't complete rubbish because I gave it a two, but it just isn't good in my opinion, I just cannot find the humor in it anymore.

While the animation has changed a bit as technology developed, the irreverance and ""no one or group is off limits"" attitude were there from the beginning.

1746469,4,B00006FDCR,"I guess that's fitting since Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo makes his first appearance this season. South Park is a show that I never really saw until some time after it began on comedy central in 1997, but like many others, when I did see it I was hooked. This essential 3 DVD set includes the 13 episodes that make up Season one. Before this set arrived and before I owned DVDs (perish the thought!) I only had the first three VHS tape volumes totaling 6 episodes! So at that point I hadn't seen the majority of season one! I can still remember when there was so much talk that season sets wouldn't happen, but like Chef told Cartman - ""You wait and you wait and you wait..."" as did I and it finally came! Season one ran from August '97 to February '98 and includes the following:
Disc One:
01. Cartman gets an anal probe
02. Volcano
03. Weight Gain 4000
04. Big Gay Al's big gay boat ride

Disc Two:
05. An elephant makes love to a pig
06. Death
07. Pinkeye
08. Damien

Disc Three:
09. Starvin' Marvin
10. Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
11. Tom's Rhinoplasty
12. Mecha-Streisand
13. Cartman's Mom is a dirty slut

Each disc includes the same set of South Park/Comedy Central promo commericals, but disc 3 has these additional features:
- Cartman's ""O Holy Night"" video
- Ned's ""O Little town of Bethlehem"" video
- Jay Leno's appearance on South Park (shown on Tonight Show)

1746470,4,B00006FDCR,"The first season of South Park is good, but compared to the intelligence and relevance of Matt Stone and Trey Parker's later work on the show, this is almost child's play. Funny nonetheless, you can't forget that it is what got Stone and Parker's foot in the door and its initial success led to the clearance to do (almost) anything they wanted on the show, allowing it evolve into the program it is today. Cruder in animation, it is a reminder of where the show has come from compared to where they are technologically today. Season one includes many of the classic episodes though, and the complexity of their writing abilities is able to shine, proving that we could be watching stick figures and we'd still be watching.",1383004800,,723,4.65625

1746537,5,B00006FDCR,"The first season of South Park is arguably one of its best. This is a great way to start a collection, or continue one. Each disc shows one of Kenny's deaths from the season. The quality is good for the time, but you cannot skip scenes, you  have to fast forward to skip through. Also, each episode has a hilarious intro by Matt and Trey! The first half they are sitting by the fire with their dog that changes every shot. (If you look closely, you can see that it becomes a toy at one point) The second half, they have a wild west introduction, and on the final episode, they are entertaining at a retirement home, (note that not much sound editing went into this intro). Also, currently Amazon carries the new jewel-box set instead of the original box. I personally don't mind, but some collectors might. Overall a great set, but if you're looking for the box look in a retail store and see if they have it.",1365465600,,909,4.347058823529411

When I saw the price offered here I figured I'd go for it, and adding the second season to my order as well, I was just over the $25 minimum for the free super saver shipping (came to $28 and some change). Even with the free shipping, my order arrived within 2 days (I ordered it Saturday afternoon, it was in my mailbox Monday morning).

Oh yeah, Kenny's dead! ;) The cover art of disc 3 is again... kenny, but you can't really see if he's dead or not, as he's watching you but you can see something's happened to him.

The plots were simpler, the animation simpler, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  This season of South Park changed cable television forever, for better or worse.

1746739,4,B00006FDCR,"South Park-The Complete Season One contains the first 13 episodes of the series spanning from 8/13/1997 through 2/25/1998.
As many people know by now, the main issue with the release of volume one are the episode introductions by Tray Parker and Matt Stone at the beginning of each episode. If the were optional it would be convient as although fun to watch once or twice they do get old.
This season focuses mainly on the Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny whereas later seasons would feature character like Randy, Garrison and Butters (who won't be introduced until season 3) more heavily.

Episode 1: Cartman Gets Anal Probed
The first episode which would made using construction paper. The title of this episode gives you a good idea what it's about. A good start although it is not really one of my favorites.

Episode 2: Volcano
The boys go on a camping trip with Jimbo and Ned as a volcano is set to erupt. A decent episode bit rather forgettable. This was the first episode to have Randy (although he wouldnt be established as Stan's father for a few more episodes.).

Episode 3: Weight Gain 4000
Cartman beefs up for a televion appearance and Kathy Lee Gifford comes to town. This is oneof my favorite episodes of this season even though the Kathy Lee Gifford references are dated.

Episode 4: Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride
The South Park Cows take on The Middle Park Cowboys and Stan's new dog is a homosexual. It has it's good moments but for the most part I never really liked this episode.

Episode 5: An Elephant Makes Love To A Pig
Kyle gets a pet elephant and Cartman gets a pot bellied pig and you can figure out what happens from there. Pretty good episode.

Episode 6: Death
Stan's grandfather wants to die and stan doesnt know what to do. Trey and Matt seem to be really figuring out what each character is about here.

Episode 7: Pinkeye
The town starts becoming zombies and it's up to the boys and chef to stop it. The best episode of this season in my opinion.

Episode 8: Starvin' Marvin': The boys accedently get an ethiopian in the mail and Cartman is confused for an ethiopian. The best episode of the season right behind pinkeye.

Episode 9: Mr. Hankey, The Christmas Poo
Kyle tries to convince the town a talking Christmas poo is real while the town tries to stage a non-offensive Christmas play. I never really liked Mr. Hankey but this episode still manages to be good.

Episode 10: Damien
The son of Satan joins Garrison's class. Jesus is shceduled to face off with Satan on Cartman's birthday. Another great episode.

Episode 11: Tom's Rhinoplasty
Garrison gets a nose job and the class gets a sub that all the boys in the class are attracted to. Wendy can't stand Stan being interested in a different woman. Probally the worst episode of the season.

Episode 12: Mecha-Streisand
Barbara Streisand wants to bring down zinthar (or something like that.). Pretty good episode

Episode 13: Cartman's Mom Is A Dirty Slut
Cartman wonders who his father is as Kyle and Stan try to win America's stupidest home video. Another real good episode.",1247270400,3,3065,4.632841328413284
1746740,2,B00006FDCR,"I'll rather give it two and half stars. When this show first aired in 1997 it was funny and cool because of its shock value and vulgarity. What it did however was make whatever alternative cartoons that weren't as fast-paced and foul-mouthed seem lame. So obviously Duckman, Beavis and Butt-head and the Simpsons couldn't complete. What it also did though was make it seem okay for kids to be just as foul-mouthed and vulgar as South Park. Instead of quality programs based on good content, we would rather hear excessive swear words and see stereotypes and parodies that would make any frat boy, pre-teen and moron, laugh till they are blue. So then everyone rushed to buy the dolls and t-shirts to support this junk. I'll give it props for being somewhat original and funny but it's definitely not as much of a quality show compared to what was out there.

1746744,5,B00006FDCR,"Television programs usually have an unwritten code that making fun of some things is just plain wrong and telling lies or demeaning celebrities can get you sued... except when it comes to South Park.

For some reason South Park seems to have been granted immunity from criticism by the masses. It is the only show that appears to be able to do anything it wants, however it wants, whenever it wants, and gets away with it scott free. Sure the hotlines to the television watchdogs might be ringing off the hooks when it really gets offensive but quite frankly nobody is answering because it seems that the world just likes a good old demented outlet now and again and the safest venue appears to be the adult cartoon South Park.

The concept is simple. Combine dumbeddown 2D animation with unique characters with quite interesting and deep personalities with complex backgrounds combined with outragours stories, horrific sequences, extremely black humour, absolute stupidity, relationships gone wrong, real life famous personalities, layers of offensive material so nobody gets away unscathed, all within the framework of a small backward town that is on the tip of exploding into mayhem for one reason or another. It is all outrageous stuff... but bravo to the makers because its sooooo very funny.

Matt Stone and Tray Parker just let their minds loose every episode to come up some of the craziest television that is so original in concept that nothing out there can compete. At the same time you either love or it or hate it. There is no middle ground. You either find it 1 star extremely obnoxious or 5 stars ridiculously funny.

The downside is that the number of episodes on season one is quite limited. This has only 13. It is still worth it though but you will get more episodes with later seasons. Episodes include alien abduction, hunting trips gone wrong, building muscles, big gay Al, elephans and pigs, death, zombies, ethiopians, Mr. Hanky, Satan, Plastic surgery, Barba Streisand and Cartman's mom.",1227484800,,2014,4.932153392330384

As many have said, the quality is poor. It's like the VHS version has been transferred to DVD and the quality left the same. Also, Don't be fooled by thinking how great a 3 disc edition of season one sounds. I can assure you that 3 discs sounds better then when realizing that it is 4 episodes to a disc, and no bonus features or commentary.

If they gave the DVD presentation what it deserved, you would see that they could easily fit the entire first season onto 1 disc, maybe 2, and the rest of disc 2 could have been bonus features. but noooooooo, 3 discs sounds likes it's a lot more so people will think it's packed full of extra goodies and pay that little more then it's really worth.

Yes, I know that's no excuse for having the kids participate in their antics but as a social commentary for ADULTS, the messages in each episode are well founded.

1746820,5,B00006FDCR,"When SOUTH PARK originally aired I avoided the show because it was it was surrounded by so much hype.  A couple years ago I started watching the show and became hooked.  Sure the animation is crude, there's tons of foul language, and there are a lot of fart jokes.  Nevertheless, SOUTH PARK still has a biting relevant satirical edge that not only illustrates many societal and cultural flaws, but still remains humorous (and being offensive to everyone).

The first Season is previewed by an introduction of each episode by Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  The first set of introductions take place in what's supposed to be a cozy little cottage, the second set are black and white and are parodies of a 50s children's cowboy show, and the last episode introduction is set in a retirement home.  Not much factual information can be learned from these introductions (except in the episode about the elephant and the pig), but they do illustrate another side of the creators' humor.

The first season episodes are as follows:

""Cartman Gets and [...] Probe""--Cartman wakes up and tells the gang about his weird dreams about being visited by aliens and taken to their ship.  The children realize that Cartman wasn't dreaming and really was visited by aliens and seek Chef's advice.

""Weight Gain 4000""--Cartman wins an national environmental essay contest and starts taking a supplement to bulk up for his big television debut appearance.  Meanwhile, Kathie Lee Gifford is supposed to visit to present the award and Mr. Garrison prepares to assassinate her.

""Volcano""--Stan's Uncle Jimbo and Vietnam buddy Ned take the boys on a weekend trip of camping, hunting, and fishing.  However, the mountain that Jimbo, Ned, and the boys are staying on is a volcano that is threatening to erupt and destroy South Park.  Also, Cartman makes up a scary story about a creature named Scuzzlebut.

""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride""--the first appearance of Big Gay Al.  The South Park Cows are playing against their archrivals, the Middle Park Cowboys in a big homecoming game.  Stan is the star quarterback and gets a new dog, Sparky.  Sparky's gayness deeply confuses Stan and he loses his will to play.

""An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig""--the boys get in a genetics war with the local bullies.  The bullies try to clone Stan while the children attempt to cross breed an elephant and a pig to make a pot bellied elephant.

""Death""--Stan's 102 year-old grandfather keeps trying to get Stan to kill him.  Death eventually shows up but doesn't want the old man. Meanwhile, Kyle's mom organizes a formal protest in New York City against the ""Terrance and Phillip"" television show.

""Pinkeye""--the first Halloween show.  Kenny is killed by the crashing of the Russian space station Mir.  When a foreign substance enters his body during embalming he is resurrected from the dead as a zombie and soon the entire city of South Park is under attack by brain eating zombies.

""Starvin' Marvin""--the children adopt an Ethiopian child in order to get a sports watch.  Cartman is mistaken for the misdelivered child and is sent to Africa.  Meanwhile, South Park is overrun by genetically altered evil turkeys that multiply at an incredible rate.

""Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo""--Politically Correctness goes wild in South Park as all signs of Christmas and Hanukkah are removed from public display.  Meanwhile, as the only Jewish child in South Park Kyle feels alone and abandoned. Kyle's problem becomes even worse when he starts telling people about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo who has kept him company since he was very young.

""Damien""--a new kid, Damien, starts attending South Park. He is the son of Satan and after being made fun of heralds a battle between Jesus and Satan.  Meanwhile Cartman is throwing a massive birthday party and invites everyone but Damien and Pip.

""Tom's Rhioplasty""--Mr. Garrison gets a nose job that makes him look like David Hasselhoff and decides to leave teaching.  His permanent substitute is a beautiful young woman named Ms. Ellen.  The boys, including Stan, are all gaga over her even though Chef has told them she is a lesbian.  Wendy Testaburger sees Stan slipping away from her with his infatuation with Ms. Ellen and tells her in no uncertain terms to not mess with her man.

""Mecha-Streisand""--while working at an archeological dig site, the boys unearth a mysterious triangle.  It turns out to be a part of a mysterious object that Barbara Streisand has been searching for years to possess.  Leonard Maltin, Sidney Poitier, and Robert Smith from the band The Cure all come to the rescue to stop Mecha-Streisand before she takes over the world.

""Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut""--Cartman is depressed and begins a search for his father.  It turns out Cartman's Mom really gets around and Cartman's dad could be anyone from Chef to Mr. Garrison.

SOUTH PARK has gotten funnier and wittier each season it has been on the air, but SEASON ONE includes some classic gems, ""Pinkeye"", ""Starvin' Marvin"", and ""Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.""  Though all of the shows episodes are funny, some of the material becomes dated over time but these three remain as classics.

The DVD also includes some special features.  There are the original promos for the show that aired on Comedy Central, a music video of Cartman singing ""O Holy Night"" that originally aired as a promo, a music video of Jimbo's friend Ned ""singing"" ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" that originally aired as a promo, the ""South Park Thanksgiving"" that was featured exclusively on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" back in 1997, and the boys presentation of an award at the 1997 CableACE Awards.

SOUTH PARK SEASON ONE is a must have for fans of the serious and is worth checking out for anyone else who wants to see the origins of this highly humorous and influential satirical cartoon.",1191110400,2,5856,4.893509127789047
1746821,3,B00006FDCR,"South Park could be the most hilariously insulting show on television. At times it can be hilarious. I loved the bizarre ""Weight Gain 4000"" episode where the teacher tries to kill Kathee Lee Gifford. The ""Elephant F***s a Pig"" episode is just as crazy.

At the same time, there is a lot of killing, and the kids in the series, as well as the adults, are pretty insensitive to a lot of things. The true humor in the series is in the insensitive nature of everyone in South Park. They make fun of everyone, from homosexuals to genetic engineering to politicians to racial stereotypes. Anything is fair game for a joke.

This is a good series for adults. I wouldn't want to buy more seasons of this series, because it is so raw and cutting edge that it often goes over the edge of sanity. However, I like the characters, especially Kenny, the poor kid who always dies in every episode, only to come back to life next episode.

1746822,4,B00006FDCR,"I hate television.  I use my TV for watching dvd's and playing video games and that's about it.  Although I've never got into this whole ""tv show"" thing, I make an exception for this absolutely hilarious cartoon.

Season 1, I must say, isn't quite the best season but it's still gold.  The very first episode, ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"" is still one of my all-time favorite episodes even though the animation is poor.  Some of the extras are nice too.  One of my favorites is the scene with Jay Leno.  He's trying to have a decent conversation with the kids but all they do is ask about his chin.  Cartman's rendition of ""O Holy Night"" is awesome too.

So why not 5 stars? Well, that would be due to Trey and Matt's commentary.  They lead off each episode with some ""witty"" commentary.  Their show may be funny, but they sure as heck don't seem funny themselves.  Their commentary, with a few exceptions, is just stupid and the 'next scene' button on my remote won't let me skip it so I have to fast-forward through it.  It's just annoying.",1182470400,4,1042,4.449735449735449
1746823,4,B00006FDCR,"I had only ever seen snippets of this show before getting this set. What I got confirmed my impressions. This is juvenile humor of the worst sort packaged for adults. It's also funny.

The kids of Southpark are not particularly likeable but they are fun to watch as they try to make sense of their own base desires and the dumb antics of their adults. There are casualties. Kenny manages to get killed off in just about every episode but he is right back in the next one ready to get killed again. Cartman reminds me of all the worst kids I knew as a kid. Kyle and Stan have their bad points as well but are generally better adjusted.

The humor would, I hope, pass right over the heads of most kids but this show is not meant for kids...except for the troublesome ones who never grew up.

Episode synopses follow:

Cartman Gets an Anal Probe - Crop circles, abducted kids, UFOs and butchered bovines are clues that Cartman's anal probe was not just a bad dream

Volcano- a hunting trip gone horribly wrong goes horribly wrong when a volcano threatens to kill the kids and destroy Southpark

Weight Gain 4000 - When Cartman cheats on an essay, he wins a national award to be presented by Kathy Lee Gifford. That results in Cartman making a fool of himself and the loony gay teacher deciding to pull of an assassination attempt.

Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride - Stan gets a new dog who shows an unfortunate tendency to mount the male dogs of other kids. This causes plenty of embarrassment for the kids and the dog who runs away to a gay animal sanctuary.

An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig  - Kyle gets a new pet elephant but is troubled because it is too big to be convenient. He decides to splice the elephant  with a pot bellied pig. Instead of this, a visit to a neighboring genetic center results in a terrible mutant.

Death - Stan has a grandpa who is so old that he wants to die. He requests assisted suicide but the kids are reluctant. They finally agree and the grim reaper show up to set them straight.

Pinkeye - Earlier than usual, Kenny is killed by the falling MIR space station. To everyone's surprise, he survives being killed and becomes a zombie who proceeds to make everyone else a zombie too.

Starvin Marvin - The kids see an add for starving Ethiopians just before Thanksgiving. They decide to adopt a kid so that they can get the watch offer. Instead of getting the watch, though, they get a starving kid.

Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo - Kyle is bummed at Christmas time because he is Jewish. That leads him to come up with an imaginary friend who is not so imaginary and very troublesome.

Damien - Things get even screwier than normal when a new kid named Damien shows up at school. This Damien is the son of Satan and the stage is set for a conflict between good and evil.

Tom's Rhinoplasty - Mr Garrison decides to have some cosmetic surgery and a substitute arrives to takes his place. Since she is a hottie, chaos ensues.

Mecha Streisand - The boys find a strange artifact at an archeological site. This episode's chaos is let loose when Barbara Streisand will do anything to get it. Getting it changes her into a giant monster.

Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut - The kids are worried because Cartman is acting more weird than normal. It turns out that he is wondering who his father is. He then proceeds on a wild goose chase trying to find his father. It's a cliffhanger.",1182124800,,3402,4.398724082934609

These introductions have a *little* behind-the-scenes Q&A, but mostly expose us to Matt and Trey humor beyond that of South Park. If you've only seen the two through their South Park episodes, you'll hopefully find a favorite here. My own is the western kid's show introduction where they talk about Natasha Hendridge and long lonely nights.

The extras also contain two short animated music videos, ""O Holy Night"", where Cartman gets hit with a cattle prod when he misses a word, and *Ned* singing ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"". The boys also present a winner in the 1997 Cable ACE Award in a short piece of animation. The extras also have some skippable Comedy Central promos (read: commercials).

Here's a bit of reality for you: this is in no way a children's show, and in no way was it ever billed as one.

There is even a disclaimer at the beginning of every episode telling the viewer it's an incredibly mature show intended only for adults.

With episodes like `cartman gets an anal probe` and `mecha-streisand`the first season is great,even if it would get a lot better the next few seasons but is still great to watch. It also is an awesome place to start for new south park fan.

I consider these episodes classic and i don't think that people shoul say`this show is rude,offensing,or whatever`because thats exactly why south park is fun to watch. It actually took animated cartoon to a level not reach before,sure the simpsons are funny but south park goes to the extreme. I dare anyone to say this show is for kids,and also we are well aware that its entertaiment.

To those out there who are morally-offended over ""South Park""-you and your children should be watching something else. We all know what ""South Park"" is about-loud, obnoxious third-grade boys cheering themselves up with a little bawdy humor and smack talk. I don't see what's the big issue.

This set has all the Season One episodes, which includes some pretty funny ones like ""Cartman gets an Anal Probe"" and ""Damien."" So check this out if you like ""South Park.""",1136419200,4,473,4.974683544303797
1746967,5,B00006FDCR,"What else can I say? The headline says it all. My surprise is that up until the eight season they keep getting better with more ""aggressive"" and ""in your face"" super humor. The episode with Michael Jackson at the 8th season I believe was hillarious!! The way they -dont know the word- portray and make fun of some of the events and problems around us  is fantastic. And the way they make fun of people...what can I say.

 This cartoon series made me wanna laugh but I couldnt!!! I just couldn't stand all that humor and happy moments....snif...I so much wanna laugh with these guys...

 To analyze this 1st season and the episodes is of no use really. The only people who would give it a negative remark are maybe those who might have been offended by something in the show.

 My only comment is congrats to Matt and Trey who created something genius and funny out of thin air...and they do it for more than 8 years...",1134950400,,918,4.428571428571429
1746968,5,B00006FDCR,"All of the 13 episodes of this first season of South Park are great. Although there is something about current events or references to pop culture in every episode, I think South Park was best in these early seasons before it went down the road of Law & Order and every episode became ""ripped from the headlines"" complete with a preachy message. There are great one-liners, such as in ""Cartman gets an Anal Probe"" when Kyle urges his brother Ike to jump from the alien spaceship by telling him to do an imitation of David Caruso's career. Ike obliges by yelling ""It's my turn"" and then plunging into the ground head-first supposedly ala David Caruso post NYPD Blue. The Halloween episode is great where apparently it is discovered that accidentally embalming someone with Worcestorshire sauce causes them to become brain eating zombies as in ""Night of the Living Dead"". Local physicians examine the zombies and notice they have no pulse, no blood pressure, and puffy eyes. They diagnose the zombies with pink eye and prescribe eye drops. I highly recommend this first season of South Park, just don't look at the cartoon characters and assume that this series is in any way suitable for viewing by children.",1132185600,4,1207,4.835748792270532

1747022,4,B00006FDCR,"When I first saw the ads for South Park with its tagline about being ""why the V-Chip was invented"" I was not all that anxious to see the show.  But later after hearing people I trust say that they liked it, I did check out an occasional episode and I was really quite surprised.  While foul language and bodily functions play a serious part in the humor of the show, it is far from the simplistic Terence and Philip that is shown in the show.  Instead, all of this gutter humor hides cores of truth and insight that is almost profound at times.  This realization led me to pick up this first season.

Season one does a great job of setting the stage for the show, its characters and its overall tone.  The cast is built slowly during the season and not all characters are used in each episode (something live-action shows are often forced to do).  The framework of the disks includes introductions from the creators before each episode.  The first group include ""fireside chats"", the next group uses the black-and-white ""Southparketeers"" Western intro and the final episode uses a concert at a retirement home.  I found little point to these as they kept repeating the same jokes over and over without adding anything really new.  For instance, each episode is introduced as there all-time favorite episode.  These little intros are almost painful to watch.  Some reviewers have complained about the format of the disks and the FBI warnings stuck between episodes.  To avoid these, just hit your Next button while in the ending credits of an episode and you will jump right to the intro for the next episode.

During the episodes South Park is faced by such problems as aliens, a volcano, the living dead, kaiju celebrities, jealousy, revenge, lust and a whole lot more.  If you are a fan of the show then the first season is something you should ad to your collection.  If you are unfamiliar with the show, the first season is a good way to introduce yourself to one of the strangest shows on television.",1124755200,4,2005,4.637393767705382

1747077,5,B00006FDCR,"I had these on the 2 episodes a tape VHS copies so it's finally nice to have them on DVD. There might be some changes from this show to later ones since newer ones are more satirical while these were more all over the place. But still, it's a great season.

Cartman Gets an Anal Probe: Cartman has a dream that he gets an anal probe, only he really did and Kyle's brother Ike gets abducted by aliens(called ""visitors"" in the show). The always dependable pilot. 10/10

Volcano: The boys go with Kyle's uncle Jimbo and his friend Ned to go hunting where Cartman thinks he was in Vietnam and they meet Scuzzlebutt just when the volcano erupts. Likable episode. 8/10

Weight Gain 4000: Cartman wins an essay contest and upon learning he's gonna be on TV, starts chowing on Weight Gain 4000, meant for scrawny teenagers, not an age of 8 or 9. His award is given by Kathie Lee, which angers Mr. Garrison. Most of the episode lost its charm but how could you go wrong with ""beefcake!"" 8/10

Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride: Personally, I always hated Big Gay Al. Anyway, Stan is upset that his dog Sparky(voiced by George Clooney) is gay so he tries to ""un-gay"" him, only he has understanding of gays after meeting Big Gay Al. Also, the South Park Cows try to beat the spread, with Jimbo hatching a plan. I remember everyone always doing the ""loving you is easy cause you're beautiful, doo doo doo doo doo, aah!"" 9/10

An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig: In order to beat some kids at a science fair, the boys decide to try to mate an elephant with Cartman's pet pig Fluffy. Meanwhile, the other boys project does some destruction on the town, who looks like Stan(not really). 8/10

Death: The introduction of their favorite show Terrance and Phillip, only it sends the parents into a frenzy and try to bring down the show, not to mention the diarrhea they have. Stan's old grandpa also tries to kill himself. It's ok. 7.5/10

Pink Eye: The Halloween episode where Kenny becomes a zombie thanks to worcestershire sauce while trying to win the costume contest and deal with the brain eating zombies at the same time. Kenny dies 3 times here. Quite a record. 9/10

Starvin' Marvin: Wanting a cool watch from one of those sponsor a child ads, they end up sending a kid instead of the watch. Naming him Starvin Marvin, while Mephisto's mutant turkeys start attacking people. Cartman is sent accidentally to Ethiopia and starves until he meets the celebrity running the ads. 8/10

Mr Hankey the Christmas Poo: The debut of christmas episode favorite Mr Hankey as Kyle tries to convince everyone of Mr Hankeys existence, which sends him into the looney bin. And Cartman debuts the song favorite Kyle's Mom's a B*tch. 9/10

Damien: Cartman's excitement rises the closer to his birthday and he lets everyone know what exactly he wants. A new kid named Damien joins the class, he just happens spawn from the loins of Satan. Damien calls Jesus out to a boxing match with his father. 8/10

Tom's Rhinoplasty: Starring ""that chick from Species"" as a substitute teacher which the boys fall for only she's not into men(or boys for that matter)which sends Wendy into jealous mode. Mr. Garrison gets a nosejob which looks like a certain Baywatch star. 8/10

Mecha-Streisand: Guest voice Robert Smith of the Cure teams up with Sidney Poitier and Leonard Maltin to bring down...Barbra Streisand? who is after a magical crystal. Many peoples' favorite. 9/10

Cartman's Mom is a Dirty S*ut: Cartman's odd behaviour gets attributed to the fact he doesn't know who his father is. His quest for a 3000$ DNA test ties in with the others who are trying to win America's Funniest Home Videos. Quite good. 9/10

The episodes themselves are hilarious and quick, and I LOVE the introductions by Trey and Matt(You guys NEED to start doing those bits again, they're hilarious), but have still not started to deliver topical, political humor(That starts later in the 2nd season).The episodes themselves are HILARIOUS, i will now rate each episode with a 1-10, 10 being highest:

1.<Cartman Gets An Anal Probe>-7.5/10-Not my favorite episode, I don't really like the construction paper's grainy feel, but has very funny parts in it(""CARTMAN, THERE'S AN 80 FOOT SATTALITE DISH STICKING OUT OF YOUR BUTT!"") and a fairly funny intro by Matt & Trey.

2.<Weight Gain 4000>-10/10-GENIOUS episode with hilarious scenes jokes and of course....Weight Gain 4000!

3.<Volcano>-8/10-Pretty funny plotline involving Skuzzlebutt the man with Patrick Duffy for a leg, and REALLY funny lines from Cartman, plus the animation is getting alot cleaner and crisper.

4.-10/10-FUNNY AS HELL, Stan's dog is gay and they try to make it not gay....HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA, TWO WORDS...TELEVISION GOLD!!!

5.<An Elephant Makes Love To A Pig>-9/10-Weird idea eh? Elephants plus pigs....ah well who cares it makes for a great episode of South Park with Stan's Clone

6.<Death>-10/10- Funny episode with a really funny repeated line(""I'm not touching that one with a 20 foot pole"") and Creative concept.

7.-7.5/10-Funny at first but then gets a little bit stale and tired...

8.<Starvin' Marvin>-10/10-Ledgendary episode in which the boys adopt a starving etheopian, whats not to love?

9.<Mr. Hankey The Christmas Poo>-8/10-Howdy Ho! Hilarious introduction to Mr. Hankey with a hilarious scene with Kyle in the bathroom.

10.<Damien>-8/10-Pretty funny episode itself, but a HILARIOUS introduction by Matt and Trey.

11.<Tom's Rhinoplasty>-10/10-One of the best on the set, funny as mess Mr. Hat!!!

12.<Mecha Streisand>-10/10-Yet again, another ledgendary episode in which Trey and Matt really make fun of Streisand worse than anyone else in the history of the show(Besides Phil Collins...)

13.<Cartman's Mom Is A Dirty Slut>-10/10-Yes she is...but that doesnt stop this episode from being my favorite...Westside!!!

The extras on the set are lack luster, however, and don't really live up to expectations. Sure, the music videos and television promos are funny but where is the commentary here, is it THAT bad that Warner Brothers said ""Nuh Uh thats too bad even for DVD release!""...I don't think so.

1747083,4,B00006FDCR,"I was under the belief that I had missed some of the episodes from the first season of ""South Park,"" but having gone through the thirteen episodes on these three discs I was wrong.  I do not know why I thought there was some other ""first"" episode besides ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"" (besides the infamous ""Jesus vs. Santa"" made for FOX executive Brian Graden to send out to his friends as a Christmas card), but this is what happens when you come late to the party and have trouble remembering there is something else to watch besides ""The West Wing"" on Wednesday nights.  So I have decided to go back to the beginning, in this case ""South Park: The Complete First Season,"" and continue on through in order to see what I actually have missed since Comedy Central first unleashed Trey Parker and Matt Stone on the wonderful world of television animation.

There is an element of nostalgia in going back to when the idea of Cartman cursing and Kenny dying were new and provocative, but now that we are seven years down the road it is time to stop grading ""South Park"" on the curve:

(1) ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"" just pretends that we already know who the characters are and gets right to the fun, with Cartman having been probed (guess where) by aliens.  The best parts of this one are the crop circle that looks like Tom Selleck and the conversation between the visitors and the cattel (4.5 Cheezy Poofs).

(2) ""Volcano"" has the eruption of Mt. Evanson interfering with Uncle Jimbo's attempt to teach Stan the joys of hunting.  Cartman tells the story of Skuzzle-butt and everyone is surprised when the legend turns out to be true, but the use of a 1950s ""Duck and Cover"" educational film as a way of responding to a lava flow is the best bit in this one (4.0 Cheezy Poofs).

(3) ""Weight Gain 4000"" has Kathi Lee Gifford coming to South Park to give Cartman an award for the best environmental essay and Mr. Garrison trying to kill her, which pretty much constitutes a normal day in the small mountain town. Trying to provide motivation for Mr. Garrison just takes the fun out of the idea (3.5 Cheezy Poofs).

(4) ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"" has the boys convinced Stan's new dog Sparky is gay and everybody in South Park better on Stan as the new quarterback of the football team.  This is an attempt to do a satirical twist on a ""message"" story, but it has no real pizzazz (3.5 Cheezy Poofs).

(5) ""An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig"" begins the ""South Park"" fascination with the genetic engineering of Dr. Mephisto and provides the first prime example of Shelley picking on Stan.  Chef's suggestion of cross-breeding sounds better to me (4.0 Cheezy Poofs).

(6)  ""Death"" combines the wish of Stan's 102-year-old grandfather to die, Kenny's explosive diarrhea, and the attempt of the parents of South Park to get the network to take Terrence and Phillip off of the air into an episode.  Mrs. Broflovski's solution to making the network capitulate, so to speak, is the best jab on this one (4.0 Cheezy Poofs).

(7) ""Pink Eye"" has Kenny dying early in the episode and getting Worcestershire sauce mixed in with his embalming fluid, which turns him into a zombie.  Meanwhile, the boys have problems with their Halloween costumes and Cartman cannot provoke Kenny with taunts about his family being poor (4.5 Cheezy Poofs).

(8)  ""Starvin' Marvin"" would be the Thanksgiving episode, where the boys get a young Ethiopian instead of a Teiko digital sports watch and the town is over run by mutant turkeys.  Another attempt at a take off on ""message"" stories that is still falling short of the mark (4.0 Cheezy Poofs).

(9) ""Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo"" is where ""South Park"" goes completely over the edge with this inspired parody of a Christmas special.  Kyle sings ""The Lonely Jew on Christmas"" and the parents of South Park sanitize the kid's Christmas show beyond human recognition and endurance.  The cherry on top of this one is the live action commercial for the ""Mr. Hankey Construction Set"" inserted into the act break  When they talk about the toilet humor on ""South Park,"" this would be what they had in mind (5.0 Cheezy Poofs).

(10) ""Damien"" comes down to the whole town betting on a prizefight between Jesus and Satan, which happens to be the same day as Cartman's birthday party.  Everybody should see the end of this one coming, and the fact that they do not says something (4.5 Cheezy Poofs).

(11) ""Tom's Rhinoplasty"" has one of my favorite ""South Park"" plot lines and it is not the one having to do with the title, which is where Mr. Garrison goes in for a nose job and ends up looking like David Hasselhoff.  Instead, I vote for Wendy Testaburger fighting for Stan's love against the substitute teacher Ms. Ellen.  To be fair, Wendy warns Ms. Ellen not to, ah, ""mess"" with her (4.5 Cheezy Poofs).

(12)  ""Mecha-Streisand"" does a good job of taking at face value the idea that Barbra Streisand wants to rule the world and can do so because of the Triangle of Zinthar the boys find at an archeological dig.  Making fun of Streisand is okay, but I like it better when Leonard Maltin and Sidney Portier show up, and love it when the little signing girls from all those Japanese monster movies make their appearance (4.5 Cheezy Poofs).

(13) ""Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut"" is the first season cliffhanger and focuses on Cartman's attempt to learn the identify of his father.  Suffice it to say, Eric is not happy with the idea of having to wait until next season to find out, which is actually the funniest part of this one (3.5 Cheezy Poofs).

All of the episodes are introduced by Parker and Stone, who are not as funny as their animated creations and for the sake of argument we will just say that is on purpose.  In terms of the extras the short clip of Jay Leno visiting South Park is okay, as is the boys appearing the Cable Ace Awards, but the only real gem is Cartman singing ""O Holy Night"" while Kyle encourages him with a cattle prod, which is certainly as fine as any single scene from the complete first season.  Certainly ""South Park"" was different, especially when it comes to mixing being audacious with being crude, but from our perspective today it is clear Parker and Stone were trying to find their comedy footing at this point.",1103673600,8,6266,4.5874439461883405
1747084,5,B00006FDCR,"I love South Park; it's crude, funny, and offensive. Exactly what I find funny. The satire is very on-target.

But I do not wish to really review it. I am very insulted by something that South Park, in all of its crudeness, did not offend me. It is that vile, worthless, God-fearing, chickens**t, wholesome all-American mom that has no right to insult me and other fans of this show by calling men and fathers worthless slobs, and saying that worthless crap such as Teletubbies tops this show. I've got one message for you, you old stupid bag:

I hope God condemns you to Hell for seeing this show. I hope you burn, because people like you waste away your lives worrying about whether you will go to hell or not. People like you are the reason religious fanatics are targeted by shows like South Park. Damn you! Be glad I don't have your e-mail address so I couldn't send you another little letter. But I'm sure you couldn't take criticism, you damn hypocrite!!! I hope your stupid children don't grow up as neurotic and stupid as you are.",1101686400,2,1039,4.5212765957446805

And by the way, it's Kenny who gets killed every episode.  Cartman is the loud mouthed racist fat kid with the [...] mom.",1100304000,,756,4.0608108108108105
1747086,5,B00006FDCR,"For a series, especially an animated series, the first season is really good.  Simpson's, for example, didn't find its groove until about the 3rd season; South Park was great right off.  There are a lot of classic episodes in this season, and they are all hilarious.

For clarifications about the show (intended for those new to South Park):

[NOTE the following goes best with a warm glass of milk and the Oct 30, 2004 review entitled ""THIS is for children?!""  I realize that that review may not be present, and what follows will still make sense and is legit.  It's just more amusing the other way.]

Yes, this show IS offensive.  However, it's not selectively offensive, it's offensive to everybody and everything, especially religion.  Since it makes fun of everybody, it makes it okay to laugh.

This may be advertised as ""fun for the whole family,"" but if you think about the series and where it's coming from, that is a joke as well.

Kenny dying would be sad--if it only happened once.  But since it happens every time, you know that he'll be better the next time around.  Therefore, it's OK to laugh at his death.

South Park is not advertised as a kid's show, and IT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN.  Comedy Central gives it an MA rating and there is a disclaimer of sorts before each episode where it mentions that it ""contains coarse language & because of its content shouldn't be viewed by anyone.""  It's a satirical disclaimer, yes, but it DOES get across the message that the content may offend some.

In any case, parents should know what their kids are watching, and it would only make sense that they would see what a show/movie is about before buying it for their children.

In fact, if children were given something to read, instead of to watch, maybe the kids of our generation wouldn't be as brain-dead as the Teletubbies many parents let their children watch.

Introductions to episodes like Matt and Trey dressed as cowboys talking to kids is not targeting kids, but actually adults who'll  remember things like the Mouseketeers and who will laugh at the parody.

-------------

In all, if you are easily offended, this show is not for you, but I recommend it to the other 20% of the population.  It's occasionally witty, in a crude way of course, and extremely creative.

1747178,4,B00006FDCR,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are four average kids living in South Park, Colorado. But South Park is a very strange town. Many weird things happen, like an alien invasion, a disease causing zombies, a singing piece of poo named Mr. Hankey, an attempt to take over the world by Barbara Streisand, and many more. For them, it's all part of growing up in South Park.

Along with the excellent episodes, there are also some pretty cool special features. One of them being a special two-minute episode where Jay Leno comes to South Park to teach Mr. Garrison's class about Thanksgiving. Another one being a musical video where Cartman attempts to sing ""O Holy Night,"" but everytime he messes up, he gets shocked by Kyle.

SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is definitely a very memorable season of South Park, but not the best. There are many classic episodes, like the very first episode ""Cartman Gets An Anal Probe."" You can't watch an episode without laughing at some point. Although you might feel bad at laughing some of the jokes, it's still a great way to get some laughs.

1747181,5,B00006FDCR,"South Park is one of the funniest, crudest and most controversial shows in television history. Comedy Central's biggest hit to date has finally come to DVD so fans can enjoy the episodes again and again. The DVDs are better than the short lived VHS copies of the episodes that were popular for merchandise for the show and they contains tons of extras and unaired material from the shows history.
The first season of the show brought us such memorable moments as Cartman getting anal probed, the kids hunting while a volcano is about to erupt, and Kenny turning into a zombie. You can witness the filth and hilarity of Cartman, Stan, Kenny, and Kyle as they overcome the problems of their little mountain town and learn life lessons along the way in each hilarious episode.
The DVD contains extras like the documentary Going Down to South Park and their appearence on the Jay Leno show. The extras add to the entertainment of the episodes and gives a more indepth look at the show. The funniest is Cartman's ""touching"" rendition of O Holy Night.
Though the DVD lacks the lost episodes ""Jesus vs Santa"" and the more rare ""Jesus vs Frosty"" from the mix, this is a perfect gift for the South Park fan in your life. A hilarious DVD, this shows why South Park is one of the best shows ever.",1089849600,,1285,4.567099567099567

I guess that's fitting since Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo makes his first appearance this season. South Park is a show that I never really saw until some time after it began on comedy central in 1997, but like many others, when I did see it I was hooked. This essential 3 DVD set includes the 13 episodes that make up Season one. Before this set arrived and before I owned DVDs (perish the thought!) I only had the first three VHS tape volumes totaling 6 episodes! So at that point I hadn't seen the majority of season one! I can still remember when there was so much talk that season sets wouldn't happen, but like Chef told Cartman - ""You wait and you wait and you wait..."" as did I and it finally came! Season one ran from August '97 to February '98 and includes the following:
Disc One:
01. Cartman gets an anal probe
02. Volcano
03. Weight Gain 4000
04. Big Gay Al's big gay boat ride
Disc Two:
05. An elephant makes love to a pig
06. Death
07. Pinkeye
08. Damien
Disc Three:
09. Starvin' Marvin
10. Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
11. Tom's Rhinoplasty
12. Mecha-Streisand
13. Cartman's Mom is a dirty slut
Each disc includes the same set of South Park/Comedy Central promo commericals, but disc 3 has these additional features:
- Cartman's ""O Holy Night"" video
- Ned's ""O Little town of Bethlehem"" video
- Jay Leno's appearance on South Park (shown on Tonight Show)
- The South Park boys announce a cable ace award
Several fans have complained about the lack of episode commentary by Trey Parker & Matt Stone, but who can quibble with all 13 episodes at the push of a button? Besides each episode does include the ""fireside"" intros Trey & Matt did, which were the funniest of the three (the others being where they are ""entertaining"" senior citizens & the ""makin' bacon"" show) I was really happy they included them. South Park is here!
Thanks to Trey & Matt for the funny show and thanks to Robert Smith for destroying Mecha-Streisand!

Not afraid to offend and full of disgusting gags and rampant profanity, there is a gleaming social commentary to it all that is hidden behind all the laughs.  All 13 episodes from the first season are here as we are introduced to level headed Stan, the lone jewish boy Kyle, overweight Cartman, and ill-fated Kenny; four foul mouthed eight year olds living in the town of South Park, Colorado whose adventures range from encountering anal probing aliens (in the hilarious series premiere), to an assassination attempt on Kathie Lee Gifford, to outdueling the Grim reaper, encountering the infamous Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo, and Cartman trying to find out who is father is.  Isaac Hayes is also featured as the womanizing but wise Chef, while guest voices include George Clooney, and The Cure's Robert Smith.  All in all, South Park is still one of the most unadulturated and unflinching comedies around today, and if you missed out on it when it premiered, now has never been a better time to give South Park a visit.",1076025600,,1214,4.794258373205742

The first few episodes are crude, often thin affairs with sparse laughs, but the ball quickly gets rolling with ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"" and ""Death"", the series' first classic. ""Mr. Hanky, The Christmas Poo"" is a dead-on indictment of society's obsession with political correctness, and its message hasn't dulled a bit (nor has its belly laughs). The extras are few, but Cartman's ""Oh Holy Night"" music video is a riot, as is ""Thanksgiving With Jay Leno"".

And for the brilliant mom who acted surprised when she showed this to her children...the opening of every episode warns you that it's intended for adults.

1747218,2,B00006FDCR,"Don't immediantly judge me based on my star rating. I've been a fan of South Park since 1997. When it came out, it was actually my favorite show. However, now that I look back on some of the older episodes, I can see the huge flaws in them.
The first thing I noticed was that the humor was very differant back then. The current South Park episodes revolve around meaningful plots and have some actual good and funny jokes in them. The older episodes just use lots of bad language to try to be funny. Back in 1997, this was considered shocking and South Park immediantly became popular because of this. Then around the time period of 1999, t.v. started crossing new borders and South Park was no longer new or shocking. It was at this time when the creators changed the show to rely less on language and more on pure humor.

Johnny, you seem like the kind of person who would rather just beilive whatever you are fed then go out and process your own ideas.  South Park sends a great message, that message (amoung other things) is to think.  South Park is not only hillarious, but it provides a diferent look on many events that are occuring in the world right now.  If you, Johnny, can not seem to grasp that concept then please do not post reveiws.  As you said, you have NEVER seen the show.  I take it your just one of those self richous guys who just thinks that their opinon is the word of God.  And on that note, cuss words?

But to insult those who DO like South Park and presume to judge us and our morality is extremely insulting, irresponsible, and IMMATURE. Please take your rants elsewhere.

My favorite episode was the Halloween one because I like zombies and vampires, and stuff like that.  I would also like to write my opinion on certain reviews.  Some people have complained about the show, and feel it needs to be protested against, and gotten rid of.  THAT IS WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!  Children should NOT be watching South Park.  On the cover it says it's intended for mature audiences only and it also says that before each and every episode.  Just because some people are stupid enough to show it to their kids, doesn't mean they have to ruin it for all of us.  Those people kind of remind me of Kyle's mom.  She can't discipline her child, so she protests everything and everyone.  If the show is cancelled, I will write to the network every day demanding that it be put back on the air.

1747269,4,B00006FDCR,"PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT:
First off I'm writing this review for all the people who did not buy this dvd because of all the negative reviews (I was like that too) it was getting.
We all know ""South Park"" the in your face hilarious comedy adventures along with Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, & Stan and of course a few other surprises. This DVD features the entire first classic season. Packed with great classic episodes such as:
* ""Cartman Get's An Anal Probe""
  - Alien Visitors kidnap Kyle's little brothr, mutilate innocent cows, and give Eric Cartman an anal probe. Full of flaming farts for your to enjoy.
* ""Mr. Hankey, The Christmas Poo""
  - The classic Christmas episode in which the city of South Park is getting ready for a non-denominatinal holiday. And we meet what or who everyone is calling, ""What the hell is that thing?"" that's Mr. Hankey to you my friend. Oh and talk about classic & history in-the-making, Kenny doesn't ... well you know.
* ""Cartman's Mom Is A Dirty Slut""
  - The infamous episode that got just about everyone pissed, well actually it's what came after it that got everyone mad. But anyways it's a great episode full of laughs and Will we discover the identity of Cartman's father? Could it be Mr. Garrison? Chef? or the 1979 Denver Broncos? Well you just have to wait and see.
That was just a highlight you still have 10 more great episodes including ""Starvin' Marvin"", ""Pinkeye"" the hilarious Halloween epiode, & fan-favorite ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"" which features George Clooney as ""Sparky"". This set is great for any South Park fan and for anyone into non-sense comedy.
Now concerning the actual DVD quality ...
  * Visual/Piture Quality: So it's not the best quality but it's exactly how the first season looks, c'mon it was back in 1997 plus we all know South Park ain't exactly the best animation out there. The only problem is that yes you can indeed see a few shades on a few of the episodes and well if you concentrate on it, yes it can be annoying but it's really not a big deal.
  * Audio Quality: Many have complain about a big amount of ""pops"" & ""clicks"" you hear on this dvd which was one of the reasons I didn't want to buy this dvd I figured they would be annoying, well to my surprise there is no such thing. I hear nothing, maybe it was only on the older versions but I hear nothing.
The extras on this dvd are rather weak. Although some stuff on here is ok there isn't anything that good to watch more than once.
  * TV Spots - if you're a fan you might enjoy them but it's really nothing.
  * Cartman ""O Holy Night"" video; I was dissapointed because I wanted to hear the whole version of the song because you must admit hearing Cartman sing is just plain hilarious. Instead we get a skit of him singing the song. It can be enjoyable, it's ok.
  * Ned ""O little town of bethlemen"" video; this is just plain annoying although others might find it funny.
  * ""A South Park Thanksgiving"" (Tonight Show with Jay Leno) exclusive skit/clip; it's decent & somewhat funny.
  * Award Presentation : This was actually somewhat entertaining.
BTW the audio commentary from the producers that was not included on here for legal reasons can be found on the Comedy Central South Park website. All you have to do is send in 1 proof of purchase and a very small amount of $$$ for s/h.
Overall this box-set is a must for all fans. Only problems I see is some picture quality and the fact that there is NO section/chapter skip therefore you must go through most of the annoying & old (well some) director introductions for every episode; then again you can always fast-forward. Go buy it now!!! And the 4 star rating is due to that the 1st season is not my personal favorite but still it is a great and classic season.",1056758400,6,3749,4.461200585651538

As to this package - it's an incredible ripoff.  The episodes' audio tracks are full of pops and cracks that distract from the viewing.  The picture is generally pretty good, but with some notable flaws.
The audio flaws are completely ridiculous.  I'm not a p[erfectionist - but these are genuinely distracting.  Anyone with a copy of Wave Editor could have removed them and produced something better than what's been distributed here.  You wouldn't think a major corporation would cynically throw a highly flawed version of these cartoons out to the public in a ""complete"" set like this.  But they did it.  Many consumers have returned their set to the store as defective, only to learn when they play their second copy that the discs were actually distributed in this highly defective state.
The extras are far from all that.  You'll watch them once, then never again.

That's what the whole episode focused on! That's only their personalities! It shouldn't take up a whole show! Anyway their are some great episodes like: An elephant makes love to a pig,Death, Pinkeye, Damien, Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo and Cartmans monm is a dirty slut. S.P. Rules!

There is a big down side however. As others have noted there are pops in the audio which most certainly is a post production error that the lamest audio engineer could have fixed. Disc 3 seems to be clear of the problems if that makes your purchase decision any easier.
Warner Brothers put almost nothing into the quality of the actual content and most of it's money on a 3 DVD set with cardboard case. It is cynical and typical of how a mega-corp slaps material together and says NEW! NEW!
There isn't anything new other than popping audio. The set could have been two discs with room to spare. The extras are fun but far from essential.
There are too many highlights to discuss in a brief review. I didn't see most of this season, a couple of episodes were on reruns but for the most part much of this set was new to me and features the early development of characters. South Park continues to defile sacred cows and is perhaps a bit more developed as the series progresses but this is the beginning and for a first season the quality is remarkably consistant.
Buy it if you want to watch these episodes over and over but realize that Warner Brothers did a poor quality audio transfer and almost nothing in addition to this fine series.
If you are easily offended pass on South Park in general. If Jesus on cable access offends you, you won't be happy with much of South Park. If you dig talking pooh, creative cursing, have any memory of being a little kid - especially males then you'll have a lot of laughs from this set. But the botched quality needs mentioning as it seems almost wrong to reward Warner Brothers for the cynical disrespect they show towards the people that purchase their wares.

In fact, WB is starting to get a nice reputation for being one of the worst distributors of DVDs.  As for South Park, the biggest gripe I had was the deletion of the audio commentaries, but I wanted to reserve judgement until I could actually hear them.  Now that I have I can only guess that the ""stardards issues"" involved one or all of the following: a) fear of a slander lawsuit by Barbara Streisand or Bob Saget, b) Matt and Trey ripping of the movie ""Contact,"" which WB owns, or c)several references to Fox, another network Matt and Trey shopped the show to.
Whatever the reason, it's nothing a disclaimer at the beginning of the DVD wouldn't have fixed.  But even though it pains me that I can't give the DVD 5 stars becasue of Warner's foolishness, I love the show too much to give it 3.",1048204800,,920,4.394117647058824

1747321,4,B00006FDCR,"No animated series since ""The Simpsons"" so completely trashes and celebrates American pop culture like ""South Park."" Beyond the obvious dirty language and inuendo that critics have sought to define this Comedy Central series, there are some excellent, albeit twisted, observations about our lives to be found with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, et al. The 1997-98 first season is the best representation of the highs and lows that this series has reached over the years, and it contains the defining episodes people are still talking about half a decade later.
This DVD set would be perfect for the casual and ardent ""South Park"" fan alike if the quality control had been a bit higher. Two episodes ""Starvin' Marvin"" and ""Damien"" were reversed in the literature on the DVD packaging. For the record, ""Starvin'"" is on disc two, ""Damien"" is on disc three. The shamelessly self-effacing Comedy Central promos are contrived, and worst of all, identical, on each of the discs and should be avoided. The audio track on the episodes suffer from a number of annoying ""pops"" that make it seem the productrion was slapped together, though the reat of the packaging suggests otherwise. Possibly the worst problem this 3 disc set suffers is the inability to easily fast-forward past the funny, but quickly tiring, introductions by show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. These guys are hilarious, the ""Scratch"" gag is priceless, but after you watch two or three of the intros, the joke starts to wear thin, cowboy costumes or no cowboy costumes.
Overall, any collection of ""South Park"" is worth the money, but this set is by no means perfect. Buy it anyway.",1045353600,7,1644,4.9601449275362315

As it turns out, the 12 episodes from the first season were on the previously released volumes 1-3.  (The 13th episode of the first season was on volume 4.)
The question for those who already own the South Park volumes is whether to purchase the new complete season set.  I'm glad to have done so.  The packaging is much nicer and each disk has the option of playing all the episodes without having to go back to the menus.  (Why aren't more discs of TV shows set up this way?!)  The introductions to each episode by Parker and Stone are still included.  Beyond that, however, there aren't much in the way of extras.  It would have been nice, particularly given that this is essentially a rerelease, to have included a bit more to entice those with the previous volumes.  Ah well, maybe for the second season set.",1041120000,2,987,4.52542372881356
1747370,2,B00006FDCR,"Let me start out by saying that if this first season of South Park weren't so great, I would have given this set 0 or 1 star.
The 2 main drawbacks to this DVD are: 1) the episode listings by disc that are included on the flaps are not even close to the sequencing that actually exists on the discs, with some episodes appearing out of order and in 2 cases not even on the same disc as noted; and 2) no chapter-within-eipsode system exists, which is made painfully obvious after sitting through the howlingly unfunny ""Fireside Chat with Matt (Stone) and Trey (Parker)"" that prefaces each show.  And although the video is quite good (due to the fact that there is only about 95 minutes of video on each disc) the sound is far less superior, filled with many audio ""pops"" and syncronization issues that were not resolved by swapping out my set for another.
In short, I would like to say that although it is great to see South Park finally come to the DVD format that allows us to appreciate the animation more, Warner Bros fell far short of even my most meager expectations for what a DVD should be.  I am glad I received this as a gift otherwise I might try to track down the Warner's CEO for my forty bucks back, and until they correct their glaring technological and quality-control issues they will not see another dime from me on future South Park releases.",1041033600,25,1359,4.432
1747371,3,B00006FDCR,"This is the first South Park collection to feature all the shows from a season in a single collection; previous collections contained only handfuls of shows, with later collections being thematically based.
Needless to say, all the first season classics are here, from ""Cartman Gets An Anal Probe"" to ""Cartman's Mom Is A Dirty Slut"" and everything in between - with the early crude animation in full effect.
I've taped just about all of the episodes as they've aired, and I've got about a half-dozen of the initial VHS collections, and I think the video transfers have been well done.
The audio is another story. While mostly much fuller sounding, there are clicks in the audio at varying intervals throughout some of the episodes. Since these clicks would be easily repairable on any digital workstation, it's probably safe to assume that they were introduced somewhere in the DVD production process. It's a shame that a relatively high-profile DVD such as this one made it through the process without the clicks being noticed, because they are distracting.
(The packaging could be a little bit sturdier as well, but that's pretty much par for the course these days.)
Finally, I suspect the set could easily have fit on two discs. Drop the cheesy intros by Parker & Stone (unchanged from the original video releases, and hardly essential), and you've got thirteen 22-minute episodes, plus maybe 15 minutes of relevant extras.
In short: GREAT episodes, flawed audio, skimpy extras.",1041033600,2,1481,5.024390243902439

-Its the ENTIRE first season collected in one low-cost set. Yes these episodes are already available on DVD, but now the whole first year is in a collected set, and previously mentioned, cheaper than buying the separate DVDs.
-Also, the commentary. Evidentially, it was SOOO controversial that it had to be REMOVED from the DVDs! Now you can get them by sending in the UPC, which I know is a pain, but from what I hear, its worth it!

According to the article, Matt and Trey did record commentaries, but Warner Home video was NOT pleased with some of the things Matt and Trey had to say - especially regarding other Warner Video titles that Matt and Trey depicted in a not-so-nice light.  When Warner told them to change the commentaries, Matt and Trey said NO WAY - seems they are sick of the studios trying to tell them what's funny and what they can include in their own show - and they got fed up and pulled the commentary tracks from the dvds.
I ordered my own set of commentaries with the special offer from the website the day after the DVDs were released.  That is fine with me.

There's a couple of extras on the third disc, and there's a 'promo' part with some shameless plugs for comedy central programs (including the Daily Show with Jon Stewart and the Man Show).
Considering it's a tv-series, and it's the first season, the video is pretty good, particularly after the second or third episode, where the production quality of the series went up. My only problem with the set is the audio. There's clicks here and there, especially in the earlier eps. I don't remember the actual tv series to have these, so it's probably an error in the dvd production.
Also, the print on the fold-out box is wrong. Apparently the 'guide' to the episodes was written based on episode numbers, while i'm assuming it was arranged by air date on the discs. The print reads that 'Damien' is on the second disc, and 'Starvin' Marvin' was on the third; it's the other way around.

13 - Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut - They boys search for Cartman's dad, but his mom slept with everyone in town.
Along with this, we also get a lot of special features like audio commentaries from the creators, deleted footage and much more!! This is a must buy for any South Park fan :)",1031616000,4,1648,4.102167182662539
1747495,4,B00006FDCR,"Sure the complete boxed set is an awesome idea and long overdue, but where are the documentaries, the commercials, the commentaries?  How about the original Christmas short?  Not to look a gift horse in the mouth but I think sales could be driven up and a lot of fans could be made very happy with things like this on what should be the ultimate South Park season one collection.  The four star rating reflects the quality of the show (which just gets better), but also the lack-luster incentives that fight for a lower rating.",1031097600,,527,4.585106382978723

ever made. I now own the first season on DVD.
It's awesome,no commercials.
I wish they didn't beep out all the swearing.
All the classic episodes are on here from Cartman
gets an anal probe,Mr. Hankey the christmas poo,well
it's got them all. You can watch anyone you want
at any time. This is a must have for those who may
still have them on video cassette. The DVD is much
better. The first season is a must have for all the
south park fans.",1030060800,,486,4.236559139784946

1. Irreverent audio commentary for all thirteen episodes from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
2. Jay Leno's South Park guest appearance as formerly seen only on ""The Tonight Show.""
3. Music Video: Two classic Christmas music videos that haven't been unwrapped since their original airing in 1997:
* Cartman: ""O Holy Night""
* Ned: ""O Little Town of Bethlehem""
4. Priceless on-camera intros to all thirteen episodes from Parker and Stone, who are as popular with the fans as their animated characters.

Ned: ""O Little Town of Bethlehem""

I must have watched these 100's of times. Big gay Al with Stan's gay dog and Tom's Rhinoplasty with Mr. Garrison looking like David Hasselhoff are two of my all time favorite South Park episodes.
The only thing I don't like about this is that they have all been released on DVD before so there are no new episodes here.
**** One big minus, you have to order the audio commentary from Trey and Matt from the Comedy Central website.  For $3.50 in shipping and handling you get 5 CD's of commentary, not bad but it should have been included in the DVD's.  Apparently they said some things about the movie ""Contact"" with Jodie Foster, and since Jodie brings in more money than South Park, they yanked it from the DVD. *****",1029456000,16,1283,4.54978354978355

The first season, as always, was very experimental and most of it was done with construction paper, so it looks crudder in comparison with the later seasons (which have been done with computers).  The only time that the animators went back to using construction paper was for the theatrical film that was released in 1999.  Even in that case, many shots were given computer enhancements.  The shoddy animation became the show's ""style"" and is now commonplace for viewers.  I greatly respect the first season and emplore all of you to do yourself a favor and preorder ""South Park - The Complete First Season"" to add to your most treasured collection.",1027641600,11,1440,4.954356846473029

When I got the Blu Ray version, it was amazing how good the transfer is. They added to the sides of the screen to make it wide screen format and they added full commentaries to every episode!

The colors pop brightly, the shapes of everything have a clean sharp edge, and if that wasn't enough they even changed the original 4:3 ratio to widescreen. What a precious gift to the eternal fans.

Unlike the DVDs which were bleeped as aired (even the Death episode where they didn't originally bleep ""dirty jew"" the first time it was aired but have since it was first aired), it's censored how it was originally released on TV.  The line ""dirty jew"" is retained in this version, however.  But they have said that after season 2, that everything is uncensored.",1515801600,,629,4.63063063063063
