THE CORN IS GREEN(1978, TV movie, matted 1.85:1)

 -No Extras

As with other recent WB sets, the selection of films here does not represent the ""best of"" Katherine Hepburn.  Since many of her better films have already seen DVD release, the WB classics folks had to choose from ""the best of what's left!""  Like any backseat driver, I would have made other selections than they did.

What we get is a lesser known Tracy/Hepburn vehicle(WITHOUT LOVE), a landmark  early Hepburn performance(MORNING GLORY), a clever comedy(SYLVIA SCARLET), a horribly miscast and botched epic(DRAGON SEED), a lukewarm suspenser(UNDERCURRENT), and one of her last great roles(CORN IS GREEN).

The sources look pretty good overall.  As usual, the MGM transfers are the best, with the RKO transfers from existing materials of varying quality.  SCARLET looks pretty good, MORNING GLORY has white botches all over the picture and a soft, dupey quality.

I have to pick another bone with WB over the packaging.  I've gotten used to the keepcases or slimcases featuring original poster art.  In a departure from the normal, this thing is presented in a digipack(discs stacked 2x2 on three panels) with a clear plastic cover (like that seen on the WB/BBC new DR. WHO series).  The individual discs also do not feature poster art...mostly black with pink lettering!  Pink!?!  I doubt Kate would have approved!  Hopefully, this is a one-off and WB will return to original poster art covers for subsequent classics releases.

Anyway, given any negative statements, it's a pretty good set overall.",1180656000,10,2395,5.4423076923076925
2770488,5,B000NJXG68,"Thank God Warner Bros is on the ball with Katharine Hepburn!

She deserves this and so do her fans.

""Sylvia Scarlett""- panned in 1936 when RKO released it, this gem directed by George Cuckor with Hepburn and Cary Grant about con artists and sexual ambiguity was scandalous at its time, and although the plot is thin in certain parts, as a whole today it's a great movie. Hepburn looks great dressed as ""Sylvestor.""

""Without Love"" - one of the lesser known pairings of Hepburn and Tracy, but still a gem about a loveless marriage of convienance. Lucille Ball plays Hepburn's best friend/realtor.

""Undercurrent"" - beautiful cinematography, yet Hepburn never struck me as the ""victim."" Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum costar with her in a story about a newly married couple, and Hepburn's worries over her husband's mysterious past and mysterious brother.

""Morning Glory"" - ""My name is Eva Lovelace, my stage name, you've probably never heard of me because I'm just starting."" - Hepburn won her first Oscar for Best Actress as a stagestruck girl destined to get into the theatre. There's supposedly a cut scene between her and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. where they perform the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, and I wish they would include it on the extra features, but I don't think they will for some reason. Adolphe Menjou co-stars as well.

""Dragon Seed"" - this is probably the only one of the bunch that I wish they'd left out. At the time it was critically acclaimed (it was 1944), yet by today's standards having American actors portraying Chinese peasants is ludicrous. The movie isn't horrible; however, I don't see why they couldn't have actually used Chinese actors, but blame the Studio System of the 1940's and racial intolerance for that. Hepburn however does portray and independent, freedom fighter peasant woman, and that is the only admirable thing I can think about this movie based on Pearl Buck's novel.",1173312000,36,1925,4.925925925925926
2770489,4,B000NJXG68,"Not a moment too soon, the Katharine Hepburn Signature Collection finally arrives on DVD. A brief description of the titles:

Morning Glory (1933)

Eva Lovelace, would-be actress trying to crash the New York stage, is a wildly optimistic chatterbox full of theatrical mannerisms. Her looks, more than her talent, attract the interest of a paternal actor, a philandering producer, and an earnest playwright. Is she destined for stardom or the ""casting couch""? Will she fade after the brief blooming of a ""morning glory""?

Undercurrent (1946)

Young bride Ann Hamilton soon begins to suspect that her charming husband is really a psychotic who plans to murder her.

Sylvia Scarlett (1935)

Escaping to England from a French embezzlement charge, widower Henry Scarlett is accompanied by daughter Sylvia who, to avoid detection, ""disguises"" herself as a boy, ""Sylvester."" They are joined by amiable con man Jimmy Monkley, then, after a brief career in crime, meet Maudie Tilt, a giddy, sexy Cockney housemaid who joins them in the new venture of entertaining at resort towns from a caravan. Through all this, amazingly no one recognizes that Sylvia is not a boy...until she meets handsome artist Michael Fane, and drama intrudes on the comedy.

Without Love (1945)

In World War II Washington DC, scientist Pat Jamieson's assistant, Jamie Rowan, enters a loveless marriage with him. Struggles bring them closer together. Written by Ed Stephan {stephan@cc.wwu.edu}

In WWII Pat Jamieson is a scientist working, without backing, on a high-altitude oxygen mask for fighter pilots. But he has nowhere to conduct his research until he meets Jamie Rowan, a woman with a large empty country house. She has no hopes of marrying for love (and neither does Pat) but Jamie wants to help the war effort and she likes this quirky scientist and his dog, so to satisfy the proprieties they agree on a business arrangement: a marriage of convenience and partnership. They happily work on oxygen mixes instead of honeymooning. But as the footing of their relationship begins warm up, Jamie is courted by another man and the old flame that broke Pat's heart is back in his life. It will take a sleepwalking ruse, dodging in and out of doors, and a working oxygen mask to get them together again.

Dragon Seed (1944)

The lives of a small Chinese village are turned Upside down when the Japanese invade it. And heroic young Chinese woman leads her fellow villagers in an uprising against Japanese Invaders.

The Corn is Green (1979 TV version)

A strong-willed teacher, determined to educate the poor and illiterate youth of an impoverished Welsh village, discovers one student whom she believes to have the seeds of genius in him.

The disc for WITHOUT LOVE didn't play properly (wouldn't even load in one DVD player, skipped in another player), so I exchanged the set.  The same disc from the replacement set had similar problems.

It's a shame.  While these aren't Hepburn's greatest movies, they're worth seeing.  I've always liked WITHOUT LOVE quite a bit -- it's an entertaining comedy/drama in the mode of HOLIDAY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, even though it's not quite as good as those other movies based on Philip Barry plays.  MORNING GLORY is very good, and the SYLVIA SCARLETT is an enjoyable oddity that's worth seeing even if it's not up there with the other movies made by the Hepburn/Grant/Cukor team.  THE CORN IS GREEN is a quality rendition from the 70s of a well-known story.  I don't know DRAGON SEED or UNDERCURRENT, but do want to see them.

But the shoddy quality of at least the WITHOUT LOVE disc has ruined this set for me -- that movie was the main reason I bought the set, as a way of completing my Tracy/Hepburn collection.  I wish they'd re-issue that film, preferably as a remastered blu-ray.",1470700800,2,1201,4.622641509433962

2770500,4,B000NJXG68,"Funny how some film cycles run for guys like me who like to watch old-time black and white films and review them in a space like this. Quite by accident the film under review, Katharine Hepburns Academy Award-winning performance in Morning Glory, and the previous three films I have reviewed are all set in New Jack City (alright I know New York City but black and white times or now you had better have jack if you want to live there, or dream about making yourself a name there). They are all slightly different takes from hobo Meet John Doe down and out to bright guy goes to town Mr. Deeds Goes To Town to melodramatic East Side, West Side about life on the upper crust to this film about a nave wannabe actress Eva Lovelace who wants to take the town by a storm.

The Broadway part of town anyway, the stage, the legitimate stage they called it then to compare it with crass Hollywood. Eva from nowhere Vermont decided like a million guys and gals before her to flee the confines of small-town anywhere and see the bright lights of the city, of the great white way. She though is strictly from amateur night, strictly from hunger too as she tries to get that first little break that will set her on the road to stardom. A road that is filled with corpses of those who failed.

But not our gal because she had spunk, had a little talent too, but mostly she had an overweening desire to do what it took to get a shot at the stars-including in pre-Code Hollywood off-stage bedding the big Broadway producer (Adolph Monjou) and putting a spell on her acting coach and an up and coming young writer and director. Eva will as fate would have it get her big chance when an older established star got on her high horse and made one too many non-negotiable demands and left in a huff-leaving the show without a lead. No problem. Quick study Eva slated for a small role from the smitten director (Douglas Fairbanks, Junior) and the rest was history. Well not quite history because in the end, end of the film anyway, fame and fortune don't give him all she wants. What did she expect. Like I said that road is filled with corpses and the ghosts of the faded past. I don't know whether her performance was 1933 Oscar-worthy but the cautionary tale was still worth telling.",1460851200,,2266,4.41866028708134

2770524,5,B000NJXG68,"A great collection of some of Hepburn's best films. I have been trying to find a decently restored ""Undercurrent"" for several years.

2770525,4,B000NJXG68,"It's always interesting to see an unusual combining of players in atypical roles and venues.  For me, that's part of the draw of this picture.  Very credible Kate - not hyper, not emotively morose - just down to it.  Decent Robert Taylor here, my consideration of his acting ability being what he said about himself and Barbara Stanwyck, to whom he was then married.  He said that Barbara was an actress; he was just a movie star. Thought it would be quite interesting to check out this admitted mere movie star with an even stronger talent than Stanwyck (my opinion).

For those concerned with Hepburn being miscast, have you never heard of the wail of an actor or actress about being typecast?  They want to try something different, a challenge, not be locked into the same thing.  Whether she was happy with the result or not, by this time she had a say in her parts.  As for comparisons, she retains her style, keeping a much steadier hold on herself in her perplexing and sinister dilemma from Fontaine's quivering lamb caught in the brambles.

Did feel frustrated by a plot element, which comes up in films -  an improbable that you find difficult to ignore.  In this case, it is that a settled and stable girl like Ann would marry a virtual stranger after only a few weeks' acquaintance, and that her father would be gung-ho about it all.  It is a bit of a stretch.  The father only knew Alan by professional reputation and nothing at all about him as a person.  Ann and her father are of solid stock who live by deliberation and preparation.  For such a girl, regardless of her dissatisfaction with her status quo, to rush into alliance with a near stranger, break with her roots and go off alone with him is unrealistic and frustrating. The angst only grows as the folly of having done so is played out.  She's not a naive ingnue who ""falls madly in love"" and rashly runs off on such slim acquaintance.  But, that's the movies sometimes.

Some are concerned that Robert Mitchum ""has little to do,"" that catch phrase used when someone has a smaller part than one would prefer or think appropriate for them.  It helps to know where Mitchum was in his career in 1946, the year this film was released.  This picture, along with others done this same year, represent his breakout from routine B pictures with small, obscure roles and billing.  He's not the veteran actor at this point with many starring roles behind him.  As for his playing ""against type"" in this film,  since this is his first major motion picture, he has yet to be established in a type.  Rather than ""having little to do"" or being wasted in the role, it's a needed break for him, working with top actors for the first time.  Again, this role is part of his launch pad into bigger and better things.

All in all, this is one that holds interest as it goes, fulfilling suspense and outcome.  Like a lot of films, it's an experiment that brought mixed results.  Depending on your focus and entertainment bent, it's flaws and faults are forgivable, unforgivable or overborne by other elements.  For me, the novelty of the interplaying of Taylor and Hepburn, along with the variation of the Hepburn role, make this one a keeper for periodic viewing.",1351641600,2,3219,4.588441330998249

I enjoy having the box set, but I'm a packaging and extras guy, and it's just not there at ALL in this attractive looking but less than generous set, which was overpriced to begin with.  There is no booklet, no interesting features of substance (cartoon shorts, gee, thanks)  or any added value at all for the ticket price. You get the good performances, good films, though not her best, by a longshot.
It's pretty much the movies and nothing else. That's fine, but it's not the way to make a must-have box set. Corners were cut.  Yet, there is an attractiveness to the look of the boxed set, but certainly no expense was put into bonus features, finding any archival footage that certainly exists,  and there is no information of substance at all about any of the films in the box set.

Imdb synopsis:
This ""Theater of Life"" series short looks at traffic problems in Los Angeles, California, as described and experienced by Sgt. Charles Reineke, a traffic enforcement officer with the Los Angeles Police Department.

What the above doesn't point out is that along with various simulated moving violations there's also graphic footage of many accident victims, including children and old people, all bloodied, limp and freshly dead. These victims aren't acting. It's the real thing: close up, frightening, depressing. I've never seen anything quite like it. As a result of the experience, today I've thought long and hard about my own tendency to lead-foot it on the road.

On DVD, UNDERCURRENT is available only on this KATHERINE HEPBURN COLLECTION.

There are other worthwhile extras on all these discs, but none so dramatic or unforgettable as ""Traffic With the Devil.""

Rent the Bette Davis version so you can see how good this is by comparison. Warner's early version of Emlyn Williams' play is dreadful, and Davis was much too young for the role. There was no location shooting in those days, and black-and-white wouldn't have helped it either. All that's left is the value of a good teacher at the right time, and they blew that.

2770536,2,B000NJXG68,"Katharine Hepburn is a great actress, and she has made scores of first rate films.  This collection is ludicrous as a first collection for her.  ""Morning Glory"" is indeed good, and was her first Oscar.  ""Sylvia Scarlett"" is weird and doesn't quite work, but it's definitely of interest - she passes as a man, which is intriguing; Cary Grant is charming and shows his music hall background.  But it's also famous as the film Hepburn and director George Cukor APOLOGIZED for after it was made (to the producer).  ""Undercurrent"" is faintly interesting, as Katharine worries if husband Robert Mitchum is dangeorus; but she's hardly at her best as a worried wife.  ""Without Love"" is probably the dullest Tracy-Hepburn film, and Lucille Ball probably gives the best (supporting) performance in it.  ""Dragon Seed"" is a famously bad film which even at the time was ridiculed for all these Caucasions pattering around playing Asians.  (Once you get over the disconcerting casting, I admit Hepburn has good moments in it, as does Walter Huston.)  I've never seen the tv version of ""Corn is Green,"" maybe it's okay, I don't love that story, and don't love the Bette Davis version either.

But here are brilliant Hepburn films (and performances) that could or should be in a collection: ""Little Women,"" ""Alice Adams"" (fabulous performance, excellent film), ""Stage Door"" (great movie, and has the ""callalilies"" lines), ""Holiday,"" ""Bringing Up Baby"" (classic screwball comedy, one of the best), ""The Philadelphia Story.""

""The African Queen"" is a fabulous film, needs to be on a US dvd soon. All these OTHER Tracy-Hepburn are worthy: ""Woman of the Year,"" ""Adam's Rib,"" ""Pat and Mike,"" ""State of the Union,"" even ""Desk Set"" (charming), ""Keeper of the Flame"" (unusual story), ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.""  ""Summertime"" is great; ""Rainmaker"" is moving and good.  She's great in ""Suddenly Last Summer,"" excellent in ""A Delicate Balance.""  Her performance in ""Long Day's Journey into Night"" is truly great, and psychologically complex.  Of her tv movies, ""Love Amid in the Ruins"" is very good, and it has Laurence Olivier too.  Oh, and ""Lion in Winter.""

Gosh, with this many great movies, how did they come up with this list???  (Maybe rights is a big part of the answer, but even so.)  So better to buy your Hepburn films separately for now.  Hope a more valuable, less obscure Hepburn collection comes out someday.",1188259200,12,2401,5.015151515151516
2770537,5,B000NJXG68,"The movies in this collection are of different periods. They show Katharine Hepburn in a variety of parts: as a young girl (even a young boy!), a young woman, a mature adult, an old person - and even a Chinese peasant! They come from a variety of genres and highlight the versatility of this great actress. Technically the DVDs give no cause for reporach, the quality of the content of the movies varies - but Morning Glory, Sylvia Scarlett and The Corn Is Green are first rate and very watchable.",1186531200,2,497,4.533333333333333
2770538,4,B000NJXG68,"What a pleasure to watch Kate!  After buying this collection, I recently spent a day off from work with Katherine Hepburn (one from the 30's- ""Slyvia Scarlett,"" one from the 40's- ""Undercurrent"" and one from the 50's- ""The Rainmaker,""--not in this set.)  She was fascinating in each of those decades.

Something must be said about ""Dragonseed.""  I loved this film when I saw it as a teenager on TV years ago and have been waiting for it to come available on DVD.  Much will be said about non-Chinese actors playing Chinese with the funny-looking make-up, etc.  Points well made.  But also points to be forgiven.  If the viewer can get over these things (with this one and with ""The Good Earth"") and get into the characters and stories, this is wonderful story-telling and these are worthwhile stories to be told, both as the Pear S. Buck novels and as the MGM films, Caucasian actors notwithstanding.

I would collect ""The Good Earth,"" ""Dragonseed,"" and ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness,"" to get a sense of pre-WW2 China and the Japanese invasion.",1183420800,6,1046,4.766666666666667
2770539,3,B000NJXG68,"2007 is the centenary of quite a few who touched the movies one way or another:
the poet W.H. Auden, novelists Robert A. Heinlein and Daphne Du Maurier, singers Gene Autry, Kate Smith, and Connee Boswell, bandleader Cab Calloway, film score composer Mikls Rzsa, director Fred Zinnemann, and the actors Dan Duryea, Cesar Romero, Buster Crabbe, Laurence Olivier, John Wayne, Barbara Stanwyck, Fay Wray, Burgess Meredith - and one Katharine Houghton Hepburn of Connecticut.

We have already seen tributes to Wayne, and no doubt Olivier and Stanwyck will also be acknowledged. In honor of Miss Hepburn, Warner has issued a rather odd and quite endearing six-disc boxed set of films not previously available on DVD. They range widely in both chronology and quality, and few would put these particular films at the very top of the Hepburn canon, even the one that won her her first Oscar. But as I watched this motley group of films - two from RKO in the 1930s, three from MGM in the 1940s, and one TV film from the late 1970s, I was reminded what a treasure she was and is. Even in the midst of misguided melodramas and not-quite-good-enough romantic comedies, she gives unique, memorable performances. In two cases, her acting may in fact be memorably off-key rather than memorably wonderful, but she makes all these worth seeing.

Morning Glory (1933) won Hepburn an Academy Award. She's excellent as a stage-struck young woman who is trying to make it as a Broadway actress. Her eccentric, fascinating performance can even be seen as a stylized self-portrait. The film itself, directed by Lowell Sherman, is dated in fascinating ways: the stilted storytelling, the 1920s/1930s view of Broadway as the ultimate place to become a dramatic star, the sexual mores. Although it's presented rather obliquely, the parts of the plot involving Hepburn ending up in bed with big producer Adolphe Menjou, falling instantly in love with him and being just as summarily dumped, may leave your jaw dropping both at the ""adult"" subject matter and the attitudes of another era. Of course, Hepburn eventually understudies for a star-making part, and gets her chance to shine. The bittersweet last scene is both wonderful and a bit ridiculous; this isn't just from an earlier time - it seems to be from another planet.

Without Love (1945) is often described as the worst of the pictures Hepburn made with Spencer Tracy. It's no classic, but if you set your expectations accordingly, it's very entertaining. Defense industry scientist Tracy and well-to-do young widow Hepburn decide to enter into a marriage ""without love,"" based on mutual respect rather than, well, sex. This being Hollywood, you can guess how long that lasts (about ten minutes less than the running time). Lucille Ball and Keenan Wynn have amusing supporting roles - it's fun to see Ball playing a sexy sophisticate, leagues away from Lucy Ricardo. The competent but uninspired direction is by Harold S. Bucquet. His name was up until now unknown to me, but he co-directed another film in this very DVD set (see below), after doing mostly Dr. Kildare series movies before that. And although this is based on a play by Philip Barry, in which Hepburn starred on Broadway in 1942, it is a much less satisfying piece than Holiday or The Philadelphia Story, two earlier Barry-Hepburn collaborations. But she's very charming and perfectly cast.

Dragon Seed (1944) is the oddest of these six movies. It features a largely Caucasian cast playing poor Chinese farmers during the Japanese invasion of the 1930s. It's just about impossible for a 21st-century audience not to respond with appalled laughter at what seems now like a stunt. But the script, based on a Pearl S. Buck novel, is nothing if not sincere, and it has its effective moments. Still, seeing the inconsistent and almost entirely unconvincing ways the Hollywood makeup artists try to make Hepburn, Walter Huston, Agnes Moorehead and others look like Asians - well, this is entertainment in itself, after a fashion. But only for half an hour or so, and the film runs a stultifying 148 minutes. It was lavishly produced by MGM. The co-directors were Bucquet (of Without Love) and Jack Conway. Hepburn manages to project some real feeling through the silly makeup and the platitudinous dialogue.

Hepburn gives the nearest thing to a poor performance (in this set, I mean) in Vincente Minnelli's noirish melodrama Undercurrent (1946). Married to yet another war-era defense scientist (Robert Taylor), this one with a mysterious past, she's supposed to be meek and scared, and as we all know, that just ain't Hepburn. But the glossy production, along with Minnelli's gift for dcor and movement, keep this one interesting, even, or especially, when it's ridiculous. Robert Mitchum plays a supporting role that many have called inappropriate for him, but I think he's just fine, as is Edmund Gwenn as Hepburn's father (he turns up again in this set, too).

Although it's flawed, George Cukor's Sylvia Scarlett (1936) is probably the best movie in the set. It features a fierce, sexy, and delightful performance by Cary Grant as a Cockney con man - a role quite different from most of his starring parts. Hepburn is on the run from the French police with her gambler father (Gwenn again), and to put them off the trail she cuts her hair and dresses as a boy - Sylvia becomes Sylvester. This leads to some startling and very entertaining scenes with a bit of bisexual innuendo: a woman kisses and tries to seduce ""Sylvester,"" and both Grant and Brian Aherne find themselves strangely attracted to this young man. At one point, Grant and Sylvester are set to bunk together in close quarters. ""It's a nippy night out,"" says Grant, ""and you'll make a nice little hot water bottle."" Sylvester flees in fright, even though Sylvia of course has a crush on Grant. The Grant and Aherne characters are both visibly relieved when Sylvester transforms back into Sylvia, but the audience may feel a letdown: Sylvester is a captivating, unusual presence, while Sylvia tends to mewl and whine too much. The later twists and turns in the comic-melodramatic plot are far from convincing, but it's all stylish and fun nonetheless.

I considered cheating a bit on this review and skipping the 1979 The Corn Is Green, also directed by Cukor. But although it is formulaic, it hooked me right away and I enjoyed it right through to the happy-teary climax. The story is a familiar one, a la Pygmalion and To Sir With Love, an 1890s period piece about a teacher, done up in the Hallmark Hall of Fame manner, and Hepburn is probably 25 years older than the part as written. (Bette Davis, born a year later than Hepburn, played this same role in a 1945 film when she was about 36; Hepburn was about 71! Still, Ethel Barrymore was over 60 when she played the part on Broadway in 1940.) There is beautiful Welsh scenery and a fine cast, and Cukor guides it home like the old pro he was by 1979.

Produced under the auspices of Turner Classic Movies, the discs all offer splendid picture and sound quality, and all include short subjects from their era, such as a Tex Avery ""Wolf"" cartoon and a fabulous Technicolor travelogue of Los Angeles in the forties. Maybe you only want to see the pedigreed Katharine Hepburn classics like Little Women and Adam's Rib and Summertime; if so, only Morning Glory and Sylvia Scarlett come close to that grade here. But the other, less familiar movies offer aspects of Hepburn you may not see elsewhere, and their Hollywood craftsmanship, as wrapped by Warner and Turner Classics in nice shiny packages, provides several hours of great entertainment.",1182038400,75,7658,4.89899768696993
