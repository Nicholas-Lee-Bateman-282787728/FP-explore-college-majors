3910513,5,B002DH20S8,"Well done and great to show kids..... The story is sad but shows tremendous faith. If your child is sensitive, it could be scary. Just don't show before bedtime.
I would highly recommend adding this to your library of faith-based children's DVD's!",1367366400,,247,4.904761904761905
3910514,1,B002DH20S8,This movie is absolutely terrible for young children. The story is too harsh and would only scare them. I can't imagine any young child enjoying this movie. I showed it to my niece who is in the target age group and she could not sleep for a few days. I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 14.,1280707200,3,308,4.065573770491803
3910515,5,B002DH20S8,"Well-done portrayal of these early Christian martyrs. Left me wondering why it has taken so long for someone to bring their stories to prominence. The subject material is not sugar coated in any way, but remains appropriate viewing for children, although very young children might find it frightening. I am looking forward to the other videos in this series!",1262995200,7,358,5.084745762711864
3910516,5,B002DH20S8,"This DVD about St. Perpetua is the first in the new series, Catholic Heroes of the Faith.  It is well done, and I am looking forward to future films in this series.  I purchased this for our parish library, and we definitely want to include the entire series in our library when they are available.

The story of St. Perpetua and friends is well told and historically correct in this short DVD. I have heard the names of St Perpetua and St. Felicity for many years, but never knew much about them.  This children's film has peaked my interest in them, and I intend to read the writings of St. Perpetua mentioned in the film.

This movie is recommended for children eight and up. I would not recommend this for younger children as the movie deals with martyrdom and might be frightening for younger children. For more information on Catholic Heroes of the Faith, you may want to visit their website.

Highly Recommended!",1258329600,12,919,4.607361963190184
3910517,4,B002DH20S8,"This short animated film tells the story of Saint Perpetua and her companions, who were martyred in Carthage, in North Africa, in the year 203. Perpetua's writings are the earliest on record by a female Christian. The animation in this film is good, the best of any Catholic animated films I've seen, though not of the quality of The Prince of Egypt. The storyline is quite rich and historically detailed and brings to life the sorrows, fears, hopes and joys of Christianity in the Early Church. In particular, the concept that those awaiting martyrdom might fear pain, but not death, is very helpful and hopeful!

The story is quite dramatic and might be difficult for more sensitive children (especially since Perpetua and Felicity, both mothers of babies, have to part with them) though the producers have skillfully avoided gore or some details that are unnecessary for children. The comic relief, provided by the devout pagan jailer (a real-life character who ends up converting and tells Perpetua's story to others!) and his attempts to communicate with his ""gods"" helps draw children into the story as well. My younger children (ages 5-11) have been entranced by this story and have  developed a real devotion to Saints Felicity and Perpetua.

I do recommend previewing the movie first before sharing it with younger or more sensitive children.

Mike Aquilina, a pre-eminent Catholic author and speaker on the Fathers of the Church, served as script consultant for this video.

The same company has also produced a documentary entitled The Passion of Saint Perpetua: Martyr of the Faith which is also quite good and includes detailed commentary from Mike Aquilina. It tells the more complete story of Perpetua's spirituality and the visions she had before her death. Although it has some content that is a little more mature than that found in the video, on the whole it's surprisingly family-friendly and is quite moving! It's available for rental through Amazon.",1256774400,20,1971,5.070987654320987
8365202,4,B002DH20S8,"A pretty good story from Christian mythology that isn't borrowed from Jewish myths. It's got much embellishment as Septimius Severus hadn't been made into a Roman god, of course.  It is good to contrast Roman gods like Minerva with the triune Christian god.",1515888000,,257,4.976744186046512
8365203,5,B002DH20S8,"What a great video! Humorous enough to hold the attention of my kids, and heart-wrenching enough to leave me with watery eyes by the end.  An inspiring tale of bravery and faith, that manages to depict a gory martyrdom in a non-graphic way. I love this.",1496707200,,253,4.5
8365204,5,B002DH20S8,"Excellent video on St Perpetua.  Would suggest parents screen this movie before watching with children, while it is animated, it does end with the martyrdom of St Perpetua, St Felicity, and their friends.  It also handles some other difficult subject matter, the main characters spend a lot of time in prison and are pressured by people close to them to abandon their faith.  They also must chose homes for their children prior to their expected martyrdom.  On the whole a wonderful video, would recommend to anyone looking to deepen their faith by learning about the lives of the Saints.",1462752000,3,588,4.909090909090909

8365207,5,B002DH20S8,"This is a wonderful DVD!  Good price, very accurate portrayal on the life of Saint Perpetua, and good quality cartoon too!  Great for my kids (although since it is so accurate I caution the maturity level of kids exposed to this DVD, parents view this first to see it is appropriate for your kids) and honestly, great for adults too!  My wife and I loved it.  Thanks for this DVD.  We will be looking into purchasing others like it!",1446163200,,432,4.417721518987341

8365209,5,B002DH20S8,"This video is so well done in conveying the faith, courage, and love of the early Christian martyrs for Christ that the viewer almost forgets that s/he is watching an animated documentary of the tremendous sacrificial love of Saint Perpetua and her companions for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

I show this video every year to my third grade students, who, in turn, beg me to play it again and again.  One student was so moved by this powerful story that he borrowed it to share with his mom/family.

As a Catholic School educator, it's important to pass along to our young the exquisite beauty and treasures of The Catholic Faith, and this video is a wonderful tool for doing so.  With that being said, I did first preview this video fbefore showing it to my third (almost fourth) grade students, and would recommend to others that they do the same (preview the video) before showing it to their youngsters (it's an intense, historically accurate drama based upon the actual writings of Saint Perpetua while she and her companions were imprisoned for their Catholic Faith).",1432166400,2,1079,4.78494623655914
8365210,4,B002DH20S8,"Wow! This movie did a great job of telling history without getting too gory, yet didn't gloss over the reality. I also LOVE that its in Spanish and English- great as a religious and bilingual movie. Definitely something to screen for more sensitive little ones, but that could be said for many martyr stories. Loved the voice acting for Spanish- it didn't make me want to cry butter years of angst like Hollywood movies do.

However, going to have to deduct a star. Tunisia. There's a lot of olive complected to dark brown skinned people there that were conspicuously absent, and the movie fell into the trap of including a few token dark skinned people along with the villains having faux-British accents. Romans were a lot more multicultural than Hollywood depicts them as, and being a slave wasn't dependent on skin color. Seriously, Perpetua was most likely at least tanned, and not alabastered, naturally red-haired.

It might seem like small beans to some, but its important to reflect the real diversity of Catholics through the ages- particularly because the (dumb) stereotype is that we're all white.

Still, a very good movie.",1427760000,,1136,4.93717277486911
