I think people forget about those things.  It takes a lot to make a film so this one really is well done considering. The acting is no a list but it is not bad.  The movie is slow to follow but it is not a long movie so that makes it easier.  Visually it is stunning and honestly the best home movie I'll ever have of my daughter playing in the front yard with me.  Everyone involved in this film did a great job and who knows it may be a cult classic for future generations.,1425686400,,623,3.9838709677419355
8310473,3,B001BP14LC,"A group of friends and myself had the pleasure of viewing about a half hour of first edit film when Heather Pikas came to visit us in Florida. Although it was only a short portion, several of the ladies were already shouting at the screen....'don't go there!!'  Now finally I get to see the entire finished movie a couple of years later. Writer Robert Bloch would admire the twist in the plot as that was understated until the very end of the movie when it is all revealed. Though there are hints dropped along the way, but in such a fashion as to be subtle. Definitely a suspense movie on the level of the old Alfred Hitchcock television series  -  an entertaining mind-bender that will have you puzzling it over after the credits roll.

Technically it was well shot within the confines of their small home and Alex Pikas did a superb job getting the reactions he wanted from his wife Heather on screen (yes we heard from her how that was accomplished). Mr Pikas is noted for many award-winning television advertisements and with this independant film, it makes you wonder what he would accomplish given a finely tuned script and seasoned professionals.",1387497600,,1154,4.669950738916256
8310474,3,B001BP14LC,"For a low-budget independent film direct to DVD, this is a well-made DVD with the standard DVD menus complete with spooky music, etc.  However, the film encoded on it leaves much to be desired.  SPOILERS....

Overall, it was a quality production given the budget. If you've seen The Sixth Sense or The Others, the ultimate plot twist is no surprise. It was about 30 minutes into it (almost half-way through) that I realized that this film did not seem to be going anywhere (kinda like the miniseries Shogun) as the scenes really seemed to be stalling the action and the music was often overly dramatic. So, I was really hoping that a good twist was coming. I was let down.

Maybe I'm being thick, but I think the film fails to explain a few things. For example, what happened to the killer? In one scene, the old lady says she isn't selling; and in the next she's apparently decided to sell. What changed her mind? If the killer had control of the estate after the death of the old couple, why did he allow the sale to proceed if he really did not want to sell? So, what was the killer's M.O. after all? Real estate is probably just too complicated to be included or explained in such relatively simple and short feature films.",1225584000,,1227,4.464285714285714
