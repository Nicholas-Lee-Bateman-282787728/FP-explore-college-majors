7823115,5,6302265908,"This pairing of fourth-season MFU episodes is certainly one worth checking out.  The first episode, ""The J For Judas Affair"", stars Chad Everett and Broderick Crawford as father and son of a large multinational conglomerate, responsible for making most of the world's weapons.  Son Adam Tenza (Everett) is, however, in cahoots with THRUSH, and schemes to take the company away from his father for THRUSH's purposes.  A very strong episode, with excellent writing and entertaining plot twists, not to mention a spectacular scene with Solo and Illya breaking into the Tenza underground vault.  The episode wraps in the jungles of Guatamala and ends this whodunit with a horrifying surprise.
The second episode, ""The Master's Touch Affair"", stars Jack Lord as THRUSH defector Pharos Mandor, who's feeding names of THRUSH heads to UNCLE in exchange for money and lavish surroundings.  Unfortunately, THRUSH gruntman Valandros (Nehemiah Persoff) is planning to assassinate Mandor before he can divulge the names of the three THRUSH chiefs from London, Moscow and NYC.  The girl, in this case, is the lovely Leslie Parrish, who plays a kidnapped supermodel in the claws of Mandor.  An entertaining episode, with an elaborate escape sequence where Solo rescues a drugged Illya from Mandor's compound.
All in all, Volume 16 is one worth picking up, if for no other reason than as a worth introduction to the fourth and final season of the series.",993513600,19,1438,5.172413793103448
