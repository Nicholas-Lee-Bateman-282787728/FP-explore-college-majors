5024048,2,B006WM36LA,"I'm a fan of Simon Pegg, as I'm sure a lot of people are. As I'm sure you are if you're thinking about getting this flick. I have friends that don't like or get British humor, but they LOVE Simon Pegg and his movies! Shaun of the Dead, The World's End and ESPECIALLY Hot Fuzz I consider to be near perfect comedies! I even find something to enjoy in some of his lesser movies like How To Lose Friends And Alienate People. But an actor's natural charm can only keep you interested for so long. In a nutshell, the writing and directing isn't up to par with the actor performing it. After about a half an hour of waiting for this movie to draw me in, it was actually turning me off. If Simon Pegg's name wasn't on this, I probably wouldn't have known about it or wanted to see it as much. The concept of a children's author who makes the sudden turn to write adult murder mysteries is a good draw that offers a ton of hilarious possibilities, but rarely do they take advantage of it! Pegg does his best with what he's given, but the story overall doesn't really build or amount to anything in the end nor does it make you laugh that much along the way. Now there was a scene or two that did make me chuckle, but really it wasn't worth the hour and a half time it took to finish this movie. Even if you ARE a fan of Simon Pegg, I suggest you rent this before you spend twenty something bucks to buy it. And if you're not a fan, I wouldn't even bother. I love the guy and even I was bored throughout most of this.",1393632000,7,1508,4.097972972972973
5024049,3,B006WM36LA,"Hedgehogs. Serial killers. Laundrettes. Clean socks and underwear.

People are used to Simon Pegg either playing comic roles in funny movies (""Hot Fuzz,"" ""Shawn of the Dead""), or playing slightly less comic roles in serious movies (""Star Trek""). But ""A Fantastic Fear Of Everything"" brings up blinding, frothing-at-the-mouth terror in some of the weirdest places -- a weird black comedy with a somewhat unbalanced structure.

Children's author Jack (Pegg) is currently working on a nonfiction book about serial killers... which has turned him into a paranoid delusional mess who can barely leave his squalid apartment. He's convinced that a serial killer called the Hanoi Handshake killer is coming after him.

Then his agent informs him that a Hollywood type named Harvey Humphries wants to see his book, and it's his only chance of selling it. The meeting is at 8 p.m. Unfortunately, Jack has no clean clothes -- and in his frantic attempt to clean his underwear and socks, he ends up burning off half his hair and super-gluing a knife to his hand. And he still has no clean clothes.

Unfortunately, he also has a crippling fear of laundrettes (aka laundromats), due to his mother abandoning him there. But on the advice of his psychiatrist, he sets out to confront his fear and do his laundry in time for his meeting... only to unleash mayhem in the laundrette, and encounter something that he really SHOULD be afraid of.

""A Fantastic Fear of Everything"" is a much darker movie than most of Simon Pegg's previous movies -- the comedy here can be black as charcoal, even though it is still wickedly funny. Lots of Jack lurching around in his distorted little world, frantically trying to wash and dry his underpants and socks in the stove.

Director Crispian Mills makes everything look oddly distorted and nightmarish, from the squalid, smoky darkness of Jack's apartment to the bleak laundrette. It makes a nice illustration of how weird and crazy the world looks to Jack, and Pegg's narration keeps the story flowing.

However, it's also very uneven. The first two acts are almost like a one-man show; while a few people (his agent, some singing kids) pierce Jack's haze of delusion, he's mostly lurching around and monologuing in his own head. His quest is to get fresh socks and underwear, while avoiding being arrested. Simple, except for his crippling fear and awkwardness.

But in the last act, we suddenly switch to a more conventional narrative, with a villain and a love interest to interact with. It feels like we stepped into a different movie -- one that's still connected to the first by a few plot threads, but very different in style and theme.

Simon Pegg is the reason this movie works at all -- this is an uproariously funny actor who knows how to play his comedic roles straight. Jack is both pitiable and funny. You pity him because he's clearly messed-up and miserable, but Pegg manages to make him amusing with the constant onslaught of bad luck.

""A Fantastic Fear of Everything"" has a weird lopsided structure that makes you feel like a different movie shoved itself into the last half. However, the pitch-black comedy and Simon Pegg mean that it's still fairly entertaining.",1393545600,2,3204,4.883977900552487
5024050,4,B006WM36LA,This movie in my opinion portrays how anxiety can control your life better any other movie I have seen. The plot was however too thrown together. I myself only like the second half of the movie.,1392595200,,194,4.416666666666667
5024051,3,B006WM36LA,"I've been a fan of Simon Pegg since I discovered Shawn of the Dead and typically watch everything he does.  That's why I went ahead and jumped on watching this ""before it's in theaters"" movie.  All in all, the movie is just ok.  A large portion of the movie is Simon's character by himself.  It actually has the feel of a one man play with Simon's character acting while a voice-over plays.  That's a LOT of pressure for an actor and Simon acquits himself very well.  The part is well played and convincing.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't really encourage you to bond with the character nor is it very engrossing.  Ultimately the movie is a series of humorous one-off scenarios loosely strung together.  Simon is by far the best actor and most convincing.  Many of his co-stars seem to be phoning it in and this exacerbates the problem of the weak storyline.

I would recommend passing on this until it's in the $1 bin at walmart or you can cash in some amazon credits earned on other purchases.",1389484800,4,998,4.550561797752809
5024052,3,B006WM36LA,"My husband is a lover of all things Simon Pegg, so I surprised him with this movie for Christmas. It hasn't been released in the US, so he had only heard of it a few times but never seen it. I will start by saying that I was concerned that it may not play on my US LG Blu-Ray player, but I didn't have any issues at all.

As for the movie itself, it requires an appreciation and love of British humor (which my husband has, but I do not). He loved the movie and wanted to re-watch it the next day. I found it to be a little weird and could go without watching it again any time soon. The story was definitely not predictable, and was different than any other movie I have seen. However, I doubt it will ever have an official ""US Release"", because it is just not the type of movie that seems to do well here.",1388448000,,807,3.9814814814814814
5024053,4,B006WM36LA,"First of all, I'd like to say that one of the advantages of Blu Ray is that the region codes aren't as stingant as with DVD.  Any Blu Ray player in the states will play European disks, which makes many titles available and often at more reasonable prices than you can get in the US.  This film doesn't have a US release as of yet (and might not find a large audience to merit one).  I find Simon Pegg to be a comic genius, he can rarely do wrong.  Spaced is one of my all-time favorite television progams.  This film doesn't compare at all to Spaced, but I enjoyed it all the same.  Like some of his other films, this is a dark comedy (although some won't find it ""funny"", there aren't any zingers or jokes, but I find the situations and Pegg's reactions to be real and humorous).  It's a sort of one-man act through a large portion of it, following him around his flat as he narrates his paranoia.  His character is a real sad sack, but even while watching his pathetic misadventure, you still find something relatable about him.  His delusional, irrational phobias are wildly exaggerated, yet most of us can find something about them to identify with.  An oddball film, unconventional story which isn't something a mass audience, or even fans of Pegg's previous work will all enjoy.  Worth watching if you like off-the-wall, random movies which don't follow a standard format.  It's not a story I've seen before, perhaps with good reason!",1362182400,12,1440,4.560311284046692
5024054,1,B006WM36LA,"Normally I love Simon Pegg, but I couldn't make it through this movie.",1428537600,,70,4.461538461538462
5024055,5,B006WM36LA,I couldn't wait for this to be released in the USA so i ordered a the UK release. Don't do that unless you have a multi-region player! When it comes to anything Simon Pegg it is always good. The only movie he is in I didn't love was The Big Nothing and even that wasn't terrible. Pegg is hilarious as always.,1426636800,2,308,4.065573770491803
5024056,5,B006WM36LA,"I laughed so hard watching this film...it truly made me happy!1 It is my favorite genera, and you must be in the right mood...if you're an uptight jerk you are not going to have a good time. It is not a movie to be taken seriously at all, which is Awesome! I loved, loved, loved It!!",1424217600,,283,4.071428571428571
5024057,4,B006WM36LA,Very dark comedy (not really laugh-outloud funny) but interesting and the visual aspect is amazing. Recommend a watch.,1416960000,,118,5.611111111111111
5024058,5,B006WM36LA,"This is not your normal Simon Pegg, but it's fantastic! It sacrifices a tiny bit of comedy to add an immense amount of plot, and it's an enjoyable, interesting story throughout! Definitely a ""different' film!",1413331200,,208,4.9714285714285715
5024059,5,B006WM36LA,"I realize I'm probably the minority here, but I actually really loved this film. Though it's obvious that it's not for everyone. I predict that this movie will really appeal to those who enjoy quirky movies, offbeat horror, and dark comedy. It features many interludes that expound on psychology and allegory, which I personally enjoy very much. The visuals were a delightful mash-up of the macabre and the absurd. The characters, albeit strange, were memorable and I fell in love with them. The twist really pleased me, as did Simon Pegg's performance. I enjoy movies that have a slower plot that builds up to a unexpectedly dramatic end, and this is precisely what this film did. However, if you do not have tolerance for a slower pace, I feel like you may not enjoy this movie.

But if you're the type of person who loves esoteric, unique films with manic splashes of comedy and horror, I think this film will not disappoint.",1408752000,4,928,4.728395061728395
5024060,3,B006WM36LA,"I really wanted to like this movie.  Simon Pegg is always worth watching, and as per usual he's fantastic.  He has to be; in many ways this is almost a one-man show and he has to carry 95% of the load on his shoulder.  The other performers are really good as well.

But the script for this needed more work.  A lot more work.  This movie plays as if the director shot his first draft.  Maybe he did!

The first half of this movie was either a man's descent into madness or someone having a terrible day.  As my wife points out, you can't get a lot of comedy from ""descent into madness.""  Then halfway in, we suddenly find out he's terrified of launderettes, so scene change to a launderette for the second half of the movie.  There's also some stop motion animation at the end that someone was really in love with, but that really doesn't fit the style of the movie.  I'd say it doesn't fit the tone, but the tone shifts so much  that it was impossible to tell.

In the end, ""Fantastic Fear of Everything"" isn't awful.  It's just OK.  With an improved, more-developed script, it could have been a lot better.",1407369600,2,1108,4.305825242718447
5024061,4,B006WM36LA,"Disregard the negative reviews, if you like Britflicks you will probably enjoy this movie enough to make it worth your money. This really was a riot and another good example of Pegg's skills.",1404000000,,191,4.818181818181818

5024063,5,B006WM36LA,"Probably not what you are expecting if only going off of Pegg's previous films. This is a bit cerebral, a bit dark. But absolutely fabulous.",1400716800,2,140,4.64
5024064,4,B006WM36LA,"Poor guy--he has one of the worst nights ever!  Hilariously macabre humor, you can't help but feel for the guy at the same time you are laughing at his (self-inflicted) misfortune.  Truly, agoraphobia isn't a laughing matter, nor is real paranoia--but as usual, Simon Pegg's character is so over-the-top it's okay to laugh.  Touches of fantasy, some real scares to make you jump, and many more antics that will have you shaking your head, it's a film that will have you laughing out loud.",1398902400,3,488,4.785714285714286
5024065,1,B006WM36LA,I usually love Simon Pegg movies - and while his performance was good the story was a complete waste of time,1398902400,,108,4.190476190476191
5024066,4,B006WM36LA,"I like Simon Pegg. I think he's a natural talent and has a great comedic presence. Here he strays from his usual course, but not too far.

Here's the scoop. Pegg plays a failed children's book author now working on writing a TV series on serial killers. He's so steeped in he process he becomes paranoid to the point of being agoraphobic. He figures he's being stalked by a killer. But he needs to make a meeting with a TV producer to pitch his project. Can he overcome his issues to make the date?

This is a bit of an odd set-up. You don't see him in the process of degenerating into his madness. You see him when he's fully 'round the bend, so the rather clueless Simon from previous films is not here and I do miss him. He does play the character well though he takes a time out to up the entertainment level with his lip-synch to a gangster rap tune. It's a lot of fun but a noticeable departure from the proceedings. There is also a medium share of farce and physical humor which he handles well. It gets a bit odd in the third act but it rounds out seemingly loose stuff from the first two acts.

This IS a fun flick. Maybe not quite worth the four stars I gave it but Pegg is always a hoot to watch so it goes down easy. If you like your comedy with a bit of thrills this should suit you fine.",1398384000,2,1301,4.094117647058823
5024067,4,B006WM36LA,"I read some reviews that made it sound like this was your average Simon Pegg film. I disagree, but not in a bad way. I am a huge fan of his work, and was looking forward to his usual brand of comedy. Athough his comedic timing is similar, and he still has a slapstick kind of charm, this is so much darker than his other films. It's very dark, albeit creepy at times, a comedy that didn't have me in stitches like his other films, but I still quite enjoyed it. I think the best way to enjoy this film is to know that you are not watching the ilk of Hot Fuzz or Run, Fat Boy, Run. This is a good film, and I can see watching it again - although, I don't think it'll be among my favorites of his work.",1397088000,9,699,3.895104895104895

5024072,5,B006WM36LA,"I was heartbroken when this movie was released here, that it didn't come anywhere near where I lived so that I could go see it.  (it came out overseas in 2012, but didn't hit the states til 2014) So I decided to order it, since it was already available over there.  I was afraid that it wouldn't work in the players here since they format their discs differently.  Fortunately Blurays are formatted the same, and I was able to watch Simon Pegg being absolutely, brilliantly, hysterical!
It arrived exactly when it was supposed to (sadly not Prime eligible but still the shipping wasn't bad), and the packaging was your standard media packaging, which works.

I would absolutely recommend this movie to any diehard Pegg fan.",1394755200,,723,4.76
