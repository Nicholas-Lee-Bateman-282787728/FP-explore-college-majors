1435711,5,B00005JKU7,"...  Yes, it's slapstick, Africa, multiple story lines, poignant, bi-cultural, and FUNNY.....but what matters most here in my opinion is the incredible way the film impresses on anyone who sees it.  I first showed it to students in 1984 and have continued to defend the film and show it to my students for 18 years now.  The multiple parallels are worthy of a dissertation, the strength of the human species is breath taking, the cerebral state of knowing is phenomenial, and most of all the humor is self depreciating (to both cultures) while at the same time giving belly laughs over and over and over each time you watch it.  If you are going to buy a film, put this one at the top of your list....you won't be sorry.",1025827200,2,720,4.515384615384615
1435712,5,B00005JKU7,"The first time I saw this movie, I was overwhelmed at its simplicity.  It was unbelievably creative and I still laugh every time I watch it.  It is possibly my favorite movie.",1025481600,,175,4.4375
1435713,5,B00005JKU7,"One of the two or three funniest movies I have ever seen.  Side splitting humor.  I could watch this movie dozens of times.  The photography is marginal, and the acting isn't the greatest, but it more than makes up for it in sheer slapstick humor.",1022976000,3,247,4.444444444444445
1435714,5,B00005JKU7,"This is the most hilarious movie I have ever seen, it keeps you laughing all the way through. It is also a very go reflection on life, how good it was when it was simple and now how complicated it is now.",1022803200,2,204,3.880952380952381
1435715,5,B00005JKU7,"The story for us is that 'The Gods Must Be Crazy' is out of print. Alas. This is one of the few movies that I'm certain to view again. I have it on VHS and it never fails to get the room howling with laughter. The odd documentary quality throws every new comer to this film for a loop. Anyone who has ever worked on a cantankerous machine (as I have) or been nervous and said all the wrong things around a beautiful woman (that too), or perhaps wondered if the world we live in is run by lunatics will see themselves in this film. To quote from a line therein: it is cute and inventive. Let me know when the producers come to their senses and put this one out on DVD.",1019088000,,667,4.022556390977444
1435716,5,B00005JKU7,The God's must be crazy and The God's must be crazy 2 are the most soul lifting and funny films you will ever have the privilage to watch. A simple documentry style that is both fresh and convincing and draws you into to the world of a bushman. Demonstrates the affects of western civilisation on a tribal but more cultured civilisation. I can't praise these films enough. I want them on DVD now!!,1017705600,,397,4.4520547945205475

1435907,5,B00005JKU7,"""The Gods Must Be Crazy I"" is one of my all time favorite movies.  I was thrilled when I discovered it is available on DVD.  The comedy is pure slapstick but so much fun.

1436023,4,B00005JKU7,"4/19/2016 update - I took away a star from my review ... but not for the DVD set itself.  I received it today.  And it's pretty obvious that the DVD case used was a brittle case.  Even though it was sent in a corrugated cardboard mailer, the case seemed to have deteriorated - either before or during shipping.  Fortunately, the DVDs themselves remained unharmed.  But now I'll have to find a new case to hold the set.  Really - the entire case has cracks all over it.  OK, now the review of the set itself.

The first thing you'll notice about this DVD set is that it's cheaper than the others.  The second thing you may (or may not) notice is the ""warning"" just below the basic info on the set, reading:

Playback Region 2 :This will not play on most DVD players sold in the U.S., U.S. Territories, Canada, and Bermuda.

I live in one of the most rural areas of the USA.  And yet, I (and everyone else) has access to ""region-free"" DVD players ... DVD players that will play DVDs originating anywhere else in the world - players that will understand PAL and technically ""convert"" it to NTSC on-the-fly so it looks normal when you play it on your US television.  In fact, you may ""already"" have such a player in your home and won't have to spend a penny to ""make"" your current player region-free.

In any case, there are 2 ways to solve your problem regarding DVDs from foreign regions:

1)  Write down your DVD player's make and model number and visit the VideoHelp.com website forum.  Mention your player's make/model number in the forum and ask the experts there if there is a ""code"" you can enter to permanently ""upgrade"" your player to region-free status.  This is a freebie and forum members (like me) will give you the method.  Usually, all it involves is entering a sequence of codes using your player's remote control device.  And once you've done this, it modifies your player's ROM so it will ""always"" recognize DVDs from anywhere in the world.  However, some DVD players cannot be so upgraded.  In that event ...

2)  Type ""region free DVD player"" into Amazon's product search block.  Amazon carries a number of DVD players that are ""already"" region-free (like the Toshiba model I bought here a few years ago).  Most of them cost less than $50.  And some of them are capable of ""up-converting"" the video signal to 1080p clarity.

Bottom line?  In the 21st Century, there is simply NO reason why anyone has to complain about the ""region code"" of DVDs they buy.  All you need is the ""correct"" player to render them properly ... and you may already have such a player in your home but just don't know it (grin).

On the movies themselves, I watched both of them years ago.  They're absolutely charming, funny, and educational - all at the same time.",1460332800,6,2758,4.531440162271806
1436024,5,B00005JKU7,"These two movies kept my entire family in stitches. Completely clean family fun, charming, touching, and with a deeper meaning as well.

The hero (a Bushman) is an unselfconscious, moral person, who gets caught up in the absurdity of ""civilized"" culture in Africa.

My kids kept talking about the movie before going to bed.  They were really into it.  They truly cared about the children in the movie.  I think it is a great movie for kids and adults.  Of course, it was made in 1980, so the special effects are pretty funny to watch, but it does not take away from the movie at all.

1436525,3,B00005JKU7,"God's Must Be Crazy 1 is very funny in a slapstick sort of way and very poignant at the same time. It poses interesting questions about civilization and the meaning of intelligence.  The main star Nixau shows extraordinary understanding, patience and humanity - something we could all learn from.  The subplots of political mayhem and the bumbling scientist with the new school teacher are mildly amusing and as I said slapstick.  The heart of the story is Nixau's mission to get rid of the ""evil thing""  which caused problems in his village (a coke bottle which had been tossed out from a passing plane), and his contact with so-called civilized man.

The sequel was disappointing with a so-so plot (although the children were adorable) and inane dialogue.  It had little of the charm of the original.",1355788800,,802,4.860294117647059

He leaves his family to go to the edge of the earth and along the way encounters  a bumbling scientific ,cute guy and a city girl who meet there in Africa.  The story twists and turns and you'll be entertained the whole way to the end. And it all started with the Coke bottle.
 The second Movie is similarly filmed but the story is about a cute dark haired lawyer girl from the city who goes to Africa for a meeting.  A handsome guy like a park ranger type meets her and offers to take her for a short tour of the land by a very small 2 seater aircraft , they start out together in the plane and he becomes separated from it . The plane crashes  they both end up wandering around the bush and the desert trying to find each other. There are many twists and turns in this story that will have you laughing.

I love the film--it is funny and sweet, with several levels of story that interact, which really helps my class discussion.  It is the perfect film for this area of communication discussion for several reasons--the stories are pretty simple, few of my students have ever seen the film before, and the style of the film (with the narrative overview) allows us to really see the cultural differences.

A coworker of mine had seen it, and was so wild in his endorsement of it, that I just had to go. I instantly fell in love with it. The whole theater was laughing and loving this movie as much as I was. I have seen it many times since, and have recommended it to many friends. When ""The Gods Must Be Crazy II"" came out I, of course, had to see it, but was a little skeptical that it could live up to the greatness of the original. Happily, the creators of the two movies did not disappoint. Both are masterpieces, in my opinion. It is a testament to the strength of great story lines, inspired casting and wonderful writing, over the need for huge production budgets.

Oh well, the title was different.  I watched it on TV and afterward just had to buy a copy.  It moved every emotion inside of me.  This film is the epitome of good storytelling with a very fast paced plot full of twists and turns.

I came to Amazon looking for the movie and discovered, quite to my surprise, it's the beginning of a new genre with its own series.  Films 1 & 2, are NTSC formatted which means they're ready for American TV sets, but the last 3 are still in PAL format, suitable for European TVs.  I enjoyed the second movie as much as the first.

A bit of apparent 'slapstick'comedy that has it's roots in the personality differences we all can see.  When you add the drastic cultural contrasts of the indigenous people it becomes a worthwhile, rememberable movie for all ages.  Pure entertainment.

1436879,5,B00005JKU7,"I'm having difficulty writing this review, because every time I think about these movies, I break out laughing!

The sheer genius of it! The simplicity of the basic premise, and inevitable complications that arise when different cultures and mindsets are entangled. N!Xau's character was too brilliant for words! His facial expressions and body language when confronted with things that to us are normal but to him are bizarre and incomprehensible, display natural comedic genius! For example, when he sees the pretty schoolteacher partially undressed, to his eyes, she is the ugliest person he's ever seen! His interpretations of technology and civilized social order are hilarious; and show us and who we are (or who we think we are) from a perspective we would never have imagined.

The one liners alone are worth the price. When the biologist accidentally hangs his land rover in a tree, his comapnion says ""Why did you do that?"" or the ever present ""It's an interesting psychological phenomenon"". And we must not omit the immortal ""What bloody Rhinocerous?"" All of which you must see in context to fully appreciate.

Sure, the film looks like it was shot on a budget of about $500. But the director and actors not only work around this, but use it to great effect.

Part 2 is a little more slick and polished, but the laughs and gags abound. Slapstick comedy at its best - in an age where that art was thought to be dead.

And the comedy is suitable for the whole family.

All in all, you can't go wrong with this one.",1199404800,,1523,4.75

You may want to rent it first to be sure you like it, since it's one of those movies where some people love it and some people consider it poor quality and not funny whatsoever. I would definitely recommend it if you've ever been to Africa, especially if you've lived there for a longer period of time. I think it is pretty funny. It was filmed quite a while ago so the quality isn't fantastic. It does a good job of portraying the miscommunication and conflicts between men and women, humans and nature, as well as modernized humans and their interaction with the bushmen.

people.

1436929,4,B00005JKU7,"The DVD has two movies on it. One is the original ""The Gods must be crazy"" made in 1980 and a sequel made in 1989. I would give the original a 5 star  and the second one a 3 star because the first one is very funny and second one is less so. Although the little boy in the second film is very cute.

Both films features a Bushman named Xi who lives in the Kalahari desert and his adventures with the outside world. With parallel stories of a western biologist and a professional woman's misadventures. Xi encountered modern civilization for the first time when he decided throw away an ""evil"" coke bottle (thrown from an airplane over the desert) to the end of earth. Xi, through his own experience, interpreted the modern world as ""people with a lot of magical things"" but are ""quite illiterate"" because they lack basic survival skills (tracking animals, finding water) and they ""can't live without their magical things"".

The Kalahari desert encompasses much of Botswana and is devoid of surface water except for a short rainy season. Despite its harshness, it hosts a range of animals including elephants, zebras and rhinos. The Kalahari people are one of oldest people in the world. The film portrays them as living peaceful lives without any knowledge of the surrounding world. That is no longer true. The Bushman were forcefully removed from their ancestral land and put in housing compounds by Botswana government in the name of providing better school access. Although their true motive is to open the area for mining. The Bushman have recently won law suits that would allow them to return. The ""complete peace and harmony"" of the Kalahari people shown in the film is threatened.",1184630400,2,1688,4.773972602739726

1436932,4,B00005JKU7,"If you haven't seen this film earlier, I  invite you to my review of another film ""DERSU UZALA"". Thre is no apparent connection between these two films - one a 1975 masterpiece by a legendary Japanese director, and the other a suprise comedy hit from the '70s.

On the surface, ""GODS MUST BE CRAZY""s sounds like a common slapstick  filmed in the exotic locations of the African Kalahari. It took me few days after watching the film, when the realization dwawned on me about the significance of this seemingly simple film.

As a continuation of my earlier theme explored in the review of ""DERSU UZALA"", this film once again appears as an essay on the collision between man & modern civilization - pristine survival instincts genetically programmed into human civilization that face imminent devastation when they collide with the practices and values of modern society. There is again a sense of despair and nostalgia about the irreversible changes of planet earth, as well as a  message of conservation.

The film-maker uses a tribe of Kalahari bushmen that utilize in the most pristine discipline and use minimal natural resources for daily survival, to make the point. Using the metaphor of an empty Coke bottle tossed out by an ignorant bush pilot from a plane passing overhead and its subsequent discovery by our bush protagonist as the interface of this collision, we are treated to a series of funny almost slapstick episodes that bring the message home about apparent evils of modern life.

If you are among those that watched the film earlier in life and if you have developed an inclination to ponder about things, I invite you to use my lens to view the film all over again. Better yet, I invite you to bring home copies of both ""DERSU UZALA"" and ""GODS MUST BE CRAZY"" together and watch it over a few days. Chances are you will get under the skin of this film's aparent levity and discover the gravity of the underlying message clearly.  If you did, please feel to share your thoughts.

Don't be scared off by the fact that you've never seen (and never will see again) any of the actors in this movie, they are not important, the story IS the movie. I give the first movie 4 and 1/2 stars, the second one I will refrain from ranking as it's been a very long time and I don't remember it being very good (sadness). If this helps...My girlfriend hates Monty Python and Bruce Campbell movies (Army of Darkness anyone??) and she didn't like this movie either...I loved all of those so that's my tendency with stupid movies.

1436981,5,B00005JKU7,"The first time I saw this movie it was in the mid-eighties. At that time I thought it was the funniest movie I have ever seen. The cinema where I watched this movie was rocking with laughter for almost every scene and line spoken.

At that time the movie didn't seem philosophical so many year ago as it seems today. The simple and complacent life of the Kalahari bushmen as compared to the mechanical life of the civilized man explained with an object from the latter's world such as an empty coke bottle. How the bushmen solves problems and outsmarts his city counterparts in tight situations with the little knowledge he is aware of is something to be both watched and learnt. The movie is part narrative and starts as a documentary but then gradually sets the stage for the ludicrous plot and story. The narration continues at other points of the movie whenever it seems necessary.

I tried watching the movie a couple of years ago with grown-ups and it didn't bring about the effect it did when I watched it the first time. But more than twenty years later it can produce that same magical effect on my 7 year old. It was never so much fun.

Highly recommened to watch with your children if you like to watch movies and explain to them like a 10 year old elder brother or sister. It's an experience you'll never forget. Even the few semi-nude scenes didn't matter and can easily be passed of in a lighter vein.

Go for the double CD containing both parts 1 and 2, packaged with enough extra goodies. Both Jamie Uys and N!Xau (the only person who may have an exclamation mark in his name) are no longer with us today but they left behind memorable movies for a hearty laughter.",1176336000,,1681,4.465798045602606

Most people want to find some proof to believe in something good or bad that is happening around them. I think it's the same way as how the religions develop, from unexplainable natural causes, good wishes to help others or natural disasters that they thought were delivered from god.

These are themselves instances of real human drama. However, the dialog is good as well, in that it is so totally different from life and film. Great films.

1437075,5,B00005JKU7,"Both movies are funny when viewed from the our ""civilized"" perspective. But if one pays attention at the very beginning of the first movie one will see a tribe of people who still believe in the wisdom of their Gods who they trust implicitly to protect them from the elements and the dangers of the world. When the main character meets one of ""us"" for the first time, he has no fear. He does not know that we are the ones destroying his homeland and his way of life forever. He does not know that we are a much larger threat to him than all the animals of the wild or any monsoon or brush fire he will ever encounter. Though meant to be funny, the first movie is based on how a coke bottle thrown from an airplane (littering)impacts the life of man and his family. The second tells of how his children are captured by a large ""animal"" on wheels, which makes very strange tracks but is easy to follow. Watch these movies and laugh.

1437077,5,B00005JKU7,"These movies are from the 1970s but are still a lot of fun to watch. The premise of The Gods Must Be Crazy I is that the pilot of a small airplane throws a glass Coke bottle out a window, and the bottle lands in the Kalahair desert and bonks a little bushman on the head. The people of the bush are so primitive, they have never seen a glass bottle and, since it fell from the sky, they determined it must be a gift from the gods. This bottle causes all kinds of chaos in the tribe so the bushman embarks on a journey to find the edge of the earth and throw the bottle over. The story is this journey. The humor is gentle and loving and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The Gods Must be Crazy II is one of the few sequels that lives up the the first movie. These movies are fun for all ages with the caveat that the bushmen wear only loin clothes -- no real nudity and nothing objectionable in any way, though.",1155081600,,909,4.083798882681564

""The Gods Must Be Crazy I"" introduced us all to the Coke bottle that nearly destroyed the relationship of the Bushmen of Africa (envy, jealously, greed. None of these emotions were expressed until the man-made bird dropped the Coke bottle from the sky.) ""The Gods Must Be Crazy II"" worked with a larger budget and worked more with the animals and with N!xau's children.

This is the kind of entertainment that use to bring the whole family together and laugh together just like old times. Yes, there are some gun fights and episodes of war throughout both of them, but it's never really too intense for anyone over the age of 10. It's not traumatizing.

1437147,4,B00005JKU7,"The gods must be crazy is probably the best comedy that has ever come out of South Africa!
Its a comedy for the whole family to enjoy about a busman named Xi and his adventures... In the first movie, he finds a Coca Cola bottle that he beleives fell from the gods and was ment to be a gift. But it brings bad luck and tention in his tribe, so he sets out to throw the bottle off the edge of the world to give it back to the gods, because he beleives it is evil. But its his whacky adventures as he gets caught up between terroists, miss understanding people and so much more that will have you laughing your tooshies off!
The second movie shows our little bushmans children accidently be taken away on a truck, and Xi goes in search to find them. He finds himself in another whacky adventure! Along with alot of over the top slapstick comedy, but its great comedy!
The bonus footage isn't worth watching again. the first disc comes with photos, but there photos of the town and village the movie was shot in, but in more recent times, there not photos from the film! And theres a 20 minute long footage of catching up with the man who played Xi, but they don't translate what he says which is weird? The second disc has a just over 5 minute long of some guy remembering the director. And a couple of trailers to other films.
Overall, this is a great comedy, very underrated, everyone who has seen it should have enjoyed it! And I recomend you buy the two together! The second isn't as funny as the first, but it still is pretty good! But I highly recomend that you never buy ""gods must be crazy in hong kong"" i think it was called? that was pretty bad!!!

I've watched these movies several times in several different groups, and parts of them ALWAYS get big belly-laughs.
The DVD transfers are quite adequate - High Definition Wide-Screen.  I doubt these films could LOOK any better with the source material they had.
Several reviewers remarked about their annoyance on the accompanying documentary that translation is not offered for the comments of Kalahari Bushman star N!xau.

1437170,5,B00005JKU7,"There are two kinds of great films: those made by hundreds of people working in a tightly, cordinated effort with a large-sized budget and resources, and then there are the little films, made by a sole individual with a unique vision with just enough money to make his or her dream a reality.
Like Joe Camp's 1974 ""Benji"", Jamie Uys' ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" is of the latter category. It's a very personal and different film with a whole lot of heart. If you are a fan of big-budget Hollywood movies, then the Gods Must be Crazy most likely will fall flat on your deaf ears. But if you are in the mood for something original and special, then watch the two films in this collection and see if you aren't delighted with the already growing cult audience that cherish these movies.
You won't find any Hollywood celebrities or car chase scenes or steamy erotic sex scenes. You won't find state-of-the-art special effects or computer animation wizardry here. You won't find a huge cast or any cinematic indulgence at all. What you will find however is a film like none you have ever seen before!
I won't go into what the two films in this set are about, or tell the plot. I will say however that this is an African product that is as warm and human as anything Francios Truffaut did for French cinema. Sure there are quirks and low-budget charms galore, but they somehow add flavor to this little masterpiece rather than take away from its legacy.
Whoever you are, audiences either love or hate the Gos Must be Crazy. My wish is for everyone to see the film and keep an open mind - let the film speak to you and don't get hung up on the many little idiosyncracies and imperfections in the production and remember that this is the sole effort of one man on an extremely limited budget. Instead, get into the story and embrace the little bushmen and laugh with N!xau and the other characters in this strange but charming little film.

The God's Must Be Crazy is my husband's all time favorite film.  We are so excited that it is now on DVD as we have worn out one VHS tape and would probably have worn out the replacement as well.
I do not normally care for comedies but this one is rife with great sarcasm some obvious, some not so.  It is a hilarious commentary on modern times and how, perhaps, all our technology and advancements aren't all as wonderful as we'd like to think.
But this is a film that did not need a sequel (do any of them?).  The second film seems contrived and forced.  The humor does not seem to be as natural as the first and the story line with the children is far to ""cute-sy"" for my taste.

I also recommend Beautiful People, also by Jamie Uys, which seems to be available now too. The scene with the elephants and baboons getting drunk on marula berries is just too funny for words.

1437173,5,B00005JKU7,"The release of this dual-film DVD fulfills a long overdue need.  Few films are as timeless as this duet.  The terms describing these films vary as much as a thesaurus will allow - ""quirky"", ""off-beat"", "" even ""arty"" has been applied.  They all disguise the fact that first and foremost, these films are fun to watch.  Nearly everybody in them is an innocent at some level - the rebel chief and the poacher alike.  True evil doesn't appear.  The rebel doesn't kill children and the poacher's booty is a shame, but neither intrude on their respective stories.
To those who've never seen these films [are there truly such?] the first story provides three paths.  A Kalahari bushman finds an abandoned Coke bottle which changes his life and that of his extended family.  A biologist - ""I collect manure"" [Marius Weyner] who's terrified of women is charged with retrieving the new schoolteacher [Sandra Prinsloo] from an isolated bus-stop.  A rebel band flees from a botched political assassination.  As we trace the strings of events that will bring these protagonists to the film's climax, we are given wonderfully scenic shots of southern Africa.  We are also presented with some of the most hilarious scenes on film.  My favourite remains the Pretoria woman posting a letter.  Well, perhaps the unoccupied bush vehicle wandering up and down the hilly road . . .  There are simply too many to count.
There is much seriousness, here, also.  The Bushman kills a goat and ""they gave him the death sentence"", mutters Mputi.  An incisive statement about the ""civilised"" world's ability or otherwise in dealing with indigenous peoples.  The would-be assassin turns kidnapper - of a schoolful of children.  They must be fed and cared for.  How do you approach a known killer with such hostages?  Finally, how does someone transported from the urban world learn to deal with life in the bush?  In Africa, these remain vital questions and few lasting answers have emerged.
The second film abandons all the characters of the first with the exception of Xi, played by the Bushman, N!xau.  As the star of both films, he stands out for his portrayal of the ""natural"" man caught up in travails of encroaching civilisation.  As he seeks his missing children, who have inadvertantly been ""kidnapped"" by a pair of bumbling poachers, another biologist [Hans Strydom] and a lawyer [Lena Ferugia] are airborne to lofty heights together.  When they descend, their isolation is defined by a simple clap of the hands.  The animals don't scatter at the sound.  Nearby, a Cuban mercenary and a government soldier wrestle for the title of ""most inept military figure in Africa"".  These two alone show Uys' invention in characterisation and situation.  You never tire of watching their antics.  Meanwhile, the poachers strive to make a rendezvous to deliver tusks and skulls.
Is it ""politically correct"" to chastise the producers for failing to label this disk with a ""health warning""?  Watching them both in succession can cause stomach cramps from laughter, or tears from the poignant episodes.  Nothing in these films disappoints or appears contrived.  Uys' genius has never gained the recognition he deserved.  The ""Special Features"" gives some indication of how he worked and any Hollywood director would give his ulcers to duplicate his ability while earning new ones duplicating the labour he put into making ""Gods"".  Enjoy the fruits of that effort.  It still rewards after many viewings.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1077580800,8,3505,5.013864818024263

But i expect something good since they have finally come out on DVD with special feature.
But i'm REALLY DISSAPPOINTED cuz the special feature is very POORLY Translated. LAZY!! Let me repeat, very very POORLY and LAZY Translation!! The special feature has only 2 subtitles. ENGLISH and JAPANESE.
I believe this dvd is originally from Japan. And it was only ripped from Japanese DVD or Laser Disc and they just add English subtitle. Lazy!!

Let me explain How BAD is the translation!! and Let me define the meaning of LAZY! in this translation!
When N!XAU speak in his language, only Japanese translation available. The English Subtitle only POP-up when poeple speak ENGLISH. That is VERY VERY LAME. Here is United Stated! People speak English. We DO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH! Why they only translate ENGLISH, ONLY when people speak ENGLISH? What about ""Bushmen's language""?? Did The translator just Don't understand or they were just too LAZY?
(they can translate from japanese translation)
For the whole approx 20 minutes non English translation documentary, I have no idea what are they talking about. How do you expect people to fully understand what is going on without good translation. Only Japanese people do, cuz they translate EVERYTHING in Japanese. Including ENglish and (N!xau)Bushmen's language.
I'm saying that the movies are excellent. But the special feature is very bad translated. I feel like being cheated.

1437176,4,B00005JKU7,"Poignant slapstick is at the heart of THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY I & II (Columbia Tristar). The late South African filmmaker Jamie Ulys struck gold with his original story about a simple Bushman Xi -- played to perfection by real life Bushman N!xau -- whose world turns upside down when a Coke bottle drops out of the sky and creates numerous problems for his fellow Bushmen. On his quest to throw the bottle off the edge of the world and return it to the gods, Xi encounters the nutty civilization of the white man.
The sequel, THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY II is slicker and the contrived plot more complex but the laughs and insights are far fewer.
In an obvious attempt to be politically correct, there's a bonus feature documentary that goes in search of N!xau.  We find him living in harsh, primitive conditions. It is made clear that the fantasy Eden of the film does not really exist nor does it reflect N!xau's reality.  N!xau is interviewed and he gives extensive answers, but there are no English subtitles (on my review disc).  N!xau dies shortly after the interview and there are glimpses of his fellow Bushmen grieving at his funeral. This amazing natural actor and charismatic man was loved all over the world.  The irony that he retreated by choice or circumstances to the hard, primitive world that made him famous is hard to grasp.

It was great to see N!xau after the film and just before he died. In the interview with him, he was asked a couple of questions, which you hear in English. Of course N!xau replies in his language. The problem is that they never translate what he says! No subtitle translation, no English translation. What happened to the editorial checking in post production? This is the only, but significant flaw in the dvd package. The film IS a 5 star, but this extra flaw drags the entire package to 4 stars for me.

1)  Both ""Gods"" films are great entertainment.
2)  DVD picture quality is better than what I've seen on TV or from the VHS version, which really looked worn out.  However, don't expect ""Star Wars"" digital camera clarity.
3)  For the first time I saw both ""Gods"" movies in widescreen, which is a nice treat.  TV always shows them in Full-Screen, including the VHS version.
4)  There are documentaries of director Jamie Uys and actor N!Xau.  The one about N!Xau is the most interesting.  It details the hard, difficult live he lived in the Kalahari, in stark contrast to the happy, carefree life depicted in the films.  Clips of N!Xau's funeral are also shown.  One gripe: when N!Xau is talking, and he talks quite a bit, there is almost no translation of what he's saying!!!  Frustrating.  Nevertheless, it's still a fascinating, honest portrayal of a special man.",1075766400,31,979,4.694117647058824
1437199,5,B00005JKU7,"This set contains two great comedies set in the beautiful deserts of Botswana, Africa.
The first ""The Gods Must be Crazy"" was released in 1980.  I was surprised just how much it shows that in hair and clothing styles, but I hardly noticed after the first few minutes.  It actually starts much like a documentary, telling about life in a bushman tribe in the Kalahari.  One day, they discover a Coke bottle.  Thinking it a gift from the gods, they begin to use it for all kinds of tasks, only to find it has introduced strife to their community.  Xixo sets out to find the end of the world and return it to the gods.  Meanwhile, a despotic revolutionary is on the run after a failed coop attempt.  And a biologist is trying to get over his fear of women to transport the new school teacher and to the village.
This movie starts out a little slow, setting up the bushman culture and customs, so that when the movie gets going, we'll get the laughter.  Most of the comedy is at the expense of civilized humans, but some great points are made about out reliance on our technology.  Some of the physical gags involving the barely running jeep and the nervous biologist are priceless, and the plotting of these three stories is brilliant.
""The Gods Must be Crazy II"" (1989) once again finds Xixo traveling into the world of the strange civilized man when his kids accidentally stow away in an ivory poacher's truck.  Meanwhile, a corporate lawyer and biologist have been stranded in the desert when their plane is blown off course during a freak storm.  And two opposing soldiers are trying to capture each other.
This story starts and moves much faster.  I hadn't seen it as recently as the first one, and I'd forgotten just how funny this one was.  I think it might actually be a little funnier.  This time, there's more interaction with the wild life of the area for some great gags.  Xixo is the only returning character, but the heroes are still likable.
My only real complaint is philosophical.  These movies elevate the bushman to an almost perfect status with an ideal life.  Ironically enough, one of the documentaries does show that their lives have really been glamorized for the film and their existence is much harder.  Still, it's always good to laugh at oneself, and these movies certainly make you wonder just how civilized we really are.
The DVD set isn't quite up to normal standards for the format, but still acceptable.  Both films are presented in anamorphic widescreen, but the picture is marred by lots of dust and grain.  It's certainly still watchable, but it's not the crystal clear pictures I've been spoiled with on DVD.  The first movie is presented in mono, and I had a little trouble hearing it.  Part of the problem was what seemed like a very poor dubbing, probably partially because of the age and low budget of the original.  The sequel sounded much better in stereo, but neither movie will show off your sound system.  Still, they get the job done, and I think that less is more with these films.  Each disc has one documentary on it.  The first is a feature on the real life of star N!xau who played Xixo.  As I mentioned earlier, it paints quite a contrast to the life presented for these films.  The second is a short tribute to creator/director Jamie Ulys which give a little behind the scenes look at these movies.
While these DVD's won't be setting any new standards, they are certainly adequate.  And the films contained on them are two classic low budget comedies from the 80's.  If you're willing to laugh at yourself, pick these up.  Any fan of the movies will appreciate them, especially for the price.",1075766400,82,3643,4.601550387596899
1437200,5,B00005JKU7,"I never understood how people could nominate their favourite movie of all time until I saw this.
I suppose if you have got as far as reading this review you already know about the movie anyway!
The scenes with the land rover ""the anti Christ"" and gate opening using the rock as a hand brake would prompt me into repeated laughter for the rest of my life if played in a loop.
As a Spike Milligan, Monty Python etc fan I am not easily amused.
There are several underlying thought provoking themes here that could occupy volumes, sociological imagination, the Nacirema concept and all that.
Simply superb and superbly simple.
Buy it with a money back guarantee from me. If you don't laugh heartily and repeatedly on watching it I will refund your expenses. If I fail to - sue me and on producing any snippet from the movie as evidence any court in the world will dismiss the case!!!!!",1074470400,4,881,4.5125
1437201,5,B00005JKU7,"I agree with everybody!! The first movie is in fact, the funniest film I have and will ever see!!! Most important of all...even though it is a low budget comedy, it contains one of the most important and positive messages in motion picture history...figure it out for yourself!!! The second film is not as good as the first, but it's very funny in its own right. The films are hilarious and silly as hell, creative, thought provoking, intellectual, educational, informative, sincere...and best of all.....very ""human"" indeed!!! Enjoy two of the last ""TRUE"" comedy jewels of 20Th century cinema! Too bad Hollywood will never do something as good or honest as this!",1073865600,4,663,4.981981981981982
1437202,5,B00005JKU7,"What a blast to see so many reviews for both of these movies! I thought no one else knew about them! I started rewatching a copy of The Gods Must Be Crazy II (that I had made years ago) with my son who was 6 months old and it was the only way that I could get him to settle in at the end of the day. The movie just captivated his attention so that we watched it every night until he was two years old and started talking, then I was afraid he would copy the language of the bad guys. We still take it out once and awhile for some good belly laughs, especially when the woman tries to distract a male ostritch and the man is being chased for taking the egg, hits his head, comes face to face with a chetah, then finally lies down flat and the ostritch steps on him! The funniest lines are delivered so deadpan and the writing and switching from scenes that are all so critical to the story are brilliant, not one wasted moment. For the die hard fans of the second movie here are some of my favorite things you don't notice until you have seen it for a year straight, see if you can spot them: the man hands helping the smallest boy out of the water truck (grabbing the skull horns), also the gray metal case left next to the African soldier's jeep when he leaves the high view point to try to intercept the enemy. Also how the shape of the paper coming off of the printer in the lawyer's office matches the dried plants next to the children looking at the tracks in the sand in the next immediate scene. They do alot of that where, in the three different plots, the transition between one scene to the next is a repeat image or phrase that also applies or echos in the next scene. Fun to watch and just as interesting with each viewing! I can hardly wait for the DVDs!",1070755200,7,1767,4.109826589595376
1437203,5,B00005JKU7,Saw this several times  mostly in theaters. I have been waiting for a DVD version for ever. Let's hope it is not a grainy transfer (as other movies from this studio has been).,1068940800,,175,4.303030303030303
1437204,5,B00005JKU7,"In 1980, director Jamie Uys (1921-1996) wrote, produced, directed and even acted in a landmark film entitled ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" which is about a little Bushman named Xixo (N!xau, 1944-2003) from the Kalahari Desert who has ever ventured far from home nor has any concept of technology.  When a coke bottle falls from a plane that is flying overhead and nearly hits Xixo, he believes that it is a gift from the gods, takes it and uses it as a tool for many everyday tasks.  Other members of Xixo's tribe also use the bottle, but they eventually begin to fight over it.  Deciding that the bottle is an evil thing, Xixo decides that he must return it to the gods and begins a lengthy journey to find the edge of the world from which to throw the evil bottle away.  Also being totally uneducated about other people's (and nation's) customs and laws, Xixo hunts an animal for food in a park.  Park rangers come along, are unable to communicate with Xixo and arrest him for poaching.  Unfortunately for Xixo, he has absolutely no concept that he has done anything wrong, but when he is brought before a local court, a man is there who speaks Xixo's language.  The court awards custody of Xixo to the man, a mechanic named Mpudi (Michael Thys), who is friend and an assistant of sorts to a bumbling wildlife biologist, Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers). Andrew is smitten with his village's new school-teacher, Kate Thompson (Sandra Prinsloo).  The village also has a church whose reverend is played by Jamie Uys.  While Xixo is trying to cope with technology, while Andrew is trying to woo Kate and while Mpudi is trying to keep their demonic land rover working, a terrorist named Sam Boga (Louw Verwey) is also on the loose.
Jamie Uys' plot, dialog and direction was completely supurb in ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"".  Jamie Uys won the Most Popular Film Award from the Montral World Film Festival in 1983, and it was nominated as Best Foreign Film by the Csar Awards in France in 1984.  Sadly, ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" received no attention from the Academy Awards.  The characters in the film are both endearing and engaging, especially Xixo whose innocence in the face of modern civilization was superbly acted by N!xau.  I was very sad when I heard of N!xau passing away earlier this year.  He will always be remembered as the little Bushman.  Overall, I rate ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone. I applaud Jamie Uys, N!xau and the other actors in the film for creating such a masterpiece on a shoe-string budget and can't wait to get a copy of the film on DVD!",1068854400,107,2617,4.561965811965812
1437205,5,B00005JKU7,"There are actually two ""The Gods Must be Crazy"" not one.  The first film is crazy fun, but the second film is even crazier.  I have seem them both and it would be a great pity if only the first film became available on DVD.  The 2nd sequel of the the same title is even funnier - if that is possible.  So, now you know and Amazon has to get BOTH films.",1066348800,2,352,3.8472222222222223
1437206,5,B00005JKU7,All though only on VHS have recently seen it again for about the sixth time on cable.  The simplistic life of the bushman compared to the hectic life of big city is just amazing.  It makes our lives seem even more crazy.  I can only wish it would come out in DVD so it will last forever or more than tape anyway.  I would hate to see this film lost because of celluloid. Future generations need to see this one.,1065312000,3,411,4.1

1437236,5,B00005JKU7,"I saw The Gods Must Be Crazy in a packed theater in Beverly Hills in 1985. It was the only place playing the film in all of Southern California, so people were converging on that theater from all over the area.
A friend visiting from Alabama had heard about the movie back home, but it wasn't playing anywhere in Mobile, so he wanted to take advantage of his trip to California. I'd never heard of the film, but I trusted my friend's taste, so we went.
Man, was I glad I did! That's actually one of my most memorable moviegoing experiences. The film was a hoot! I have rarely heard a packed theater laugh so loud and so long and so passionately. I think we were all responding to the movie's off-slant sensibility--which was so different from the American comedies of the 1980s.
My brother tells me that this is one of the most-rented movies at Blockbuster. So... don't you think that it might be worth the studio's while to release it on DVD?",1055116800,13,943,4.425287356321839
1437237,5,B00005JKU7,"These two films justify the phrase ""sophisticated slapstick."" They may contain a few cliches, but if so they are so uniquely presented that they become precedent-setters.  The cultural aspect is also divinely inspired, and the ingenious use of animals makes the recipe complete.  In short, these are fabulously entertaining works of art, and if they were on DVD I would purchase them in an instant.  I might even consider buying two copies at once . . .",1035763200,3,453,4.857142857142857

This evil thing is believed to come from God and causes evil things to happen to people who have it.  On the way of getting rid of it he happens to meet a man who has hard luck with woman.  (One of the best scenes in the movie is when his four wheeled drive jeep gets stuck up a tree).  He also meets a strange woman who has trouble with men.
