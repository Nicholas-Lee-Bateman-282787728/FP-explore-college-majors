6455483,5,B00KZKWQPM,My man crush all day and everyday is Christian Keyes. I really enjoyed watching this movie. It may be low budget but it has a powerful message and everyone looks like they are having fun and genuinely enjoy each other. Jason Weaver and Vanessa Simmons are a amazingly cute couple.

6455499,5,B00KZKWQPM,"It's a great story. I love that it  shows blacks in a positive light. Normally, there would be a guy who is a player,""thug"", or con artist, but that does exist in this story line, at least it's not the main focus in the film. It's  truly a story about trust, friendship, love, and community. A must see.",1434931200,2,303,4.206896551724138

6455502,5,B00KZKWQPM,"Because of the Keyes casting of young upwardly mobile adults , It motivating, feel good entertainment and quality purchases.., Parts 1 & 2 can lead to addiction to want to see this crew & stable of actors to do a dozen more...

No doubt you could view the dvd with company and not be embarrassed caliber taste in purchase like alot of other so-called productions on the market...",1433030400,2,465,4.682926829268292

6455520,5,B00KZKWQPM,"This is a great movie, I've seen it about 5 X on cable.  It is so great and great acting all the way around.  Christian Keyes is one of my Most favorite actors and he makes the sweetest, loving, greatest, caring, fun loving, laughable movies all the times.  He nees to be on the big screen and not on cable tv.  This movie shows how a female can manipulate situations to steal a man from a slow moving woman.  She never sowed or told of her feelings and along came a spider and put all her fangs around him.  Things got really sticky and tense and you get angry because you think that the sick, lying woman will get her man, and he's too slow to see what is going on right in front of him.  HE'S BLIND BY THE FLASHINESS, like most men are when it come to a pretty woman.

ALL SEEMS LOST and looking good for the slick opportune lover.  It's all over and the true love for him has lost.

Now you must see the movie to see what happens and how this movie turned out.  YOU WILL LOVE IT, I GUARENTEE IT!!",1428796800,,1000,4.025380710659898

6455523,4,B00KZKWQPM,"Really glad to find this on Amazon.  Had rented the first half from RB, not knowing it would end without resolving.  This movie completes the story and has excellent ending, with a lot of resolution of questions begun in original, which was titled ""What Would You Do For Love?"".  You really can't get ""get it"" without both pieces.  This is not Oscar level, but very entertaining and amusing.  Well worth the time, especially if you happened to have caught the first half and wonder what happened in Paris.",1428019200,,505,4.693181818181818

I recommend that you see the first part, then watch this sequel. This film addresses issues that all couples must face. Honesty is an important part of any relationship. Recommended for fans of romantic comedies. This film would be rated PG, This is a family film. Add a star if you love Christian Keyes!",1422403200,,452,4.206896551724138

6455544,5,B00KZKWQPM,good  movie.,1416960000,,12,5.0
6455545,5,B00KZKWQPM,"This movie was done in a very tasteful decent way and matched my expectations as did Part one - ""What Would You Do For Love"". Kids and Grandma safe. No profanity or buffoonery! This is perfect for a viewing with company or any relatives over the holidays. The plot was lively as were the character development. Each of the main characters were all articulate and could be understood. It was reminiscent of ""Let's Stay Together"" tv show.  It was low budget set however it represented well and I had no ill-conceived notions about the character backgrounds. They also demonstrated how I wish more people were in film and real-life by talking out issues with another. A+ for communication. I'm familiar with the work of Carl Payne, Christian Keyes, Jason Weaver and of course Gabby Dennis and Vanessa Simmons. My only critique in this film would be they should have left the Kevin ""Heart"" segment out. In real life 100 people would ""NOT"" have been duped and not looked closer at the spelling of the performers name on their purchased tickets. All in all - a decent flick. Take note low budget film makers...this is how it's done.",1416700800,7,1126,4.715736040609137
6455546,4,B00KZKWQPM,Enjoyed part two as well as I did one. Although Christian's character seemed either confused or he was a undercover player how he could jump from the love of his life which was the other conniving chick to these strong feelings for Paula confused me.,1416441600,,250,4.5777777777777775

6455559,5,B00KZKWQPM,"Awesome movie!! Even though it was low budget, the quality of acting, people AND personality that pierced through the screen was right on time. I certainly recommend watching both part 1&2. If you don't you may not get the full impact of the plot. Absolutely loved it!!!!!!!! Its nice to see a great movie that's clean. No profanity what so ever and the most minimal public displays of affection. WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS! Especially with Christen Keyes ",1415318400,,459,4.810126582278481

6455564,5,B00KZKWQPM,"I'm so glad i finally found this movie. This part 2 of What Would You Do For Love. It was really good. It tied up all the loose ends from part 1. Aside from that, Chrisian Keyes is in almost every seen, and he is one of the main reasons why I was interested in the first place. The character is ideal. It's what and who you wan your deeam guy to be. The character gives hope to sngle ladies looking for tha special guy. It's a feel good romantic comedy.",1414368000,3,453,3.989010989010989
