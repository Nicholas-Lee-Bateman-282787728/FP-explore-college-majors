The story is timeless.
Peter Ustinov is amazing.

The film is a forgotten masterpiece.

7812619,5,6301581598,This deserves six stars for Peter Ustinov's voice alone.,1464220800,,56,5.333333333333333
7812620,5,6301581598,"Unlike the comments of a few others, my DVD was very good. Apparently digitally remastered, still mono of course, but quite watchable and enjoyable. None of the video artifacts others complained about...

I feel this is a unique and important telling of the Beowulf saga, far more humanistic when viewed from the monster's perspective.

Python fans will love the lyrical wit and satire.
High end humour.",1453852800,2,403,5.090909090909091

7812622,5,6301581598,"As a life-long fan of Sir Peter Ustinov,  I discovered this unusual movie about Beowulf. I appreciate Ustinov's wicked sense of humor which is sarcastic, intelligent, literate, and sometimes very funny.

The animation style is very bright, colorful, bold, abstract, even psychedelic.  The closest film I can think of that presents its wild color style is ""The Beatles Yellow Submarine.""  Well, the 60's are long gone...but those who are tired of conventional computer generated animation may well be intrigued by this offering.  I certainly was.

Essentially, this is the medieval poem presented in a very light version - almost like a Fractured Fairy Tale. Taken from the monster's point of view,  the humans are weak and misguided -  always warring over status, riches, or territory.  (Yes, I know that the basic premise of the cartoon was borrowed from John Gardner's book ""Grendel""...and that his work is a literary tour de force...but remember this is a cartoon!).  I loved the fact the film pokes fun at everything - kings - heroes - ministers - bards - priests - monsters - and gods.

If you are prepared to enjoy this satire for what is is - you may find it a great delight.  And Peter Ustinov's narration as the ""bored monster"" is perfect...as long as you don't take the story too seriously.  Highly recommended for a fun evening.",1347062400,6,1339,4.871681415929204
7812623,1,6301581598,"I am a high school English teacher. My class reads John Gardner's Grendel in conjunction with the epic poem, Beowulf. Not only is the animation painfully dated (and not in a cute Flintstones or Rocky and Bullwinkle, Fractured Fairytales way) but the movie trivializes and jumbles the novel.  Bumbling characters are added to Hrothgar's entourage... ye gods this movie is painful to watch.

An actual line from the movie... ""King Hrothgar's official message, ""PUSH OFF!""

Seriously?

And why is Wiglaf a part of Hrothgar's entourage?  Gah.

If you are a purist to the epic poem, Beowulf or the novel, Grendel don't pick up this movie.",1285977600,2,633,4.980952380952381
7812624,5,6301581598,"This is one of the coolest cartoons ever, I just wish Amazon had sent it to me like they were supposed to!",1175385600,3,106,3.8636363636363638
7812625,3,6301581598,"No matter how 'rare' it is.

Even 50 bucks is a bit unrealistic.

The only way I'd ever shell out an amount of money even close to that is if the movie was in DVD format.

And my limit is 30 bucks.

Oh.  A little nudge nudge wink wink.  There's technology out there that can let you record DVDs.

I suggest people start looking into it.",1151366400,3,336,4.0
