1834811,3,B00008DDKP,"In spite of this being an Australian film, it is not depressing.  Neither of course is it a drama, or a comedy, or whatever.  It's a chronical.  But since rather startling things happen every few minutes, this is not a dull film.

The point seems to be to show that Christian missionaries, government officials and, yes, anthropologists destroyed some primitive cultures, like the Trobrian Islanders.  The film is even rather honest about the natives.  They are not portrayed as faultless and good in every way.  There is plenty of semi-nudity, including many barebreasted teenage girls.  The casting of all three major roles is good and appropriate.

On the other hand, most of the movie is filmed with an orange filter--to give the appearance of the old 1920s anthropological photographs, the director says in an interview.  Why didn't he shoot it at 18 fps too, so it would look like a period flick?  Assinine!

Also, there is a blank spot in the story.  The main character, Evelyn, leaves the Trobrians and goes to New Guinea where she stays with some really savage people, head-hunters, etc.  And we are not told what happens there.  The last we see of her, the natives are stealing everything she has, including her typewriter and she is being knocked down with said typewriter by the chief who is stealing it.  When we see her again, three months later, she is limping badly and appears to be in a psychotic state (although I doubt if the filmmaker would recognize a psychotic state if he saw one).  Just what the filmmaker intended us to guess had happened is not clear, but this kind of dodging is simply cowardly filmmaking.

Still, the film ends relatively happily considering that it's an Australian film.

Bottom line: worth seeing.",1184025600,4,1745,4.814814814814815

I have since read several books on Lord Melbourne and Lady Carolina Lamb (his wife).  Mr. Sewell's nuanced performance of Lord Melbourne was excellent.  Love, Love, this movie ""In a Savage Land.'  An absolute ""hidden""gem"" of a movie.  Others have commented on the content.  Performances outstanding - Rufus and Maya Stange wonderfully nuanced in their roles.  Loved the music.  Cannot say enough about it.!",1491350400,,499,5.227848101265823

7981564,4,B00008DDKP,"If you are looking for a film that projects you into an unusual setting in a realistic manner, you can't get much better than this one.  In a pre-feminist era, a very bright and tough young woman comes to work as an anthropologist alongside her new husband.  It is in the late 1930s, right before the start of the war, and the land she enters is largely unspoiled by contact with the West.  The only westerners there are pearl traders, a colonial administrator, and a missionary.

The young lady is an extraordinary beauty, who is full of ambition and drive.  Right away, there is conflict with her husband, who views her as subordinate and out of control, a threat to his work and perhaps to herself; he may have a point, given what she discovers.  As the war develops, the tension between the 2 brews until there is a blowup and the girl heads out into the bush on her own, ferried by one of the traders.  At that point, the Japanese threat becomes very real, necessitating change.

I don't want to give any spoilers, so will avoid further description of the plot.  Though I know nothing of the culture she was investigating, her subjects appear authentically drawn, alien and not in the slightest embellished for Hollywood reasons of style or marketing. It is just a raw adventure in which an ingenue finds herself professionally and personally.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone interested in these themes.  The acting is also superb,  especially Ms. Stange and Rufus Sewell, but also Martin Donovan.",1444176000,,1522,4.7018867924528305

7981567,5,B00008DDKP,"I really enjoyed this film, and am surprised that I had never even heard of it. It did a wonderful job of projecting an authentic experience of somewhat ill-prepared anthropologists trying to do field work in New Guinea and dealing with personal issues at the same time. The local whites and Melanesians were really like some of the types you do run into there.

It is not flawless, and yet I would call it quite an accomplishment.

My biggest complaint is that the special features were too thin. Obviously the director and crew had remarkable experiences in trying to film in the field. I really would have appreciated a running commentary with some meat in it that explained more about working conditions and about the local customs that were being portrayed in the film. The film was deserving of this.

What we did get was too much ""what was it like working with so-and-so"" and ""how did you feel about the character you played?"" My golly, this was a remarkable film! Lets hear and learn about the film itself and the challenges of making it and expand on what was being shown. That would have been more respectful to the artistic creation itself and to those of us who bought the DVD.",1351987200,,1189,4.599056603773585
7981568,1,B00008DDKP,"I purchased this hoping to get some insights into the authentic Trobriand Culture.  But in fact it mixes up Trobriand myths with reality, mixes up the Trobrianders with a more violent and superstitious group of probably Dobuans later in the film, and all without much effort to separate out what is the degenerate situation of their culture today, as compared to what it was in the time of Malinowski, much less in the early 1940s.  If you read the original reports of the anthrpologist Bronislaw Malinowski, this is fairly clear.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sexual-Life-of-Savages/dp/0807046078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sexual Life of Savages</a>&nbsp;They proclaim the ""Bukamatula"" or children's house to be the ""men's house"" without elaboration, and show a mythical event of women gang-raping and pissing on a tied-up man as some real thing.  Also, the tree-jumping suicide was an extreme rarity, as the Trobrianders had little in the way of sexual shame to feel so terrible about.  There was repression and misery to be found among the Chief's clan, and later where the missionaries had their influence, as with the women wearing shirts and such -- the film touched upon that with accuracy -- but for the most part this film does not represent the original Trobriand ways.  Many of the bare-breasted women shown in the film may not even be Trobrianders, who tend to be taller and slim, and of a darker complexion than the lighter-skinned and shorter women in the film.  Or possibly, this is due to contact with caucasians over the years.  The story-line focuses upon the trials and tribulations of Western folk living among the natives.  Little is shown of the magnificent Tula-trade boats, which went all the way from the Trobriands to India and Eastern Africa, of which the boats shown in the film are degenerated examples.  No discussion of the yam harvest or farming methods, though some of the ornate village yam houses are shown.  Some of the native dress and dance appears as it was in the past times, as from older photos and films, but the confusion with the violent Dobuans was perhaps the most horrible error.  The Trobrianders originally had no word for ""stealing"" in their culture, for example, but we are shown a ""Trobriand"" village which points spears at outnumbered strangers, makes threats with machetes, and robs one of the westerners of all they have, clobbering her to the ground in the process.  Anyhow, enjoy the film, or not, depending upon your interests.  I personally found the plot line tiresome, but I was looking for something authentic, not a fictional narrative.",1292198400,2,2654,5.2018779342723
7981569,5,B00008DDKP,"I really enjoyed this film - great story, acting, cinematography, locale, direction etc.  Newcomer actress, Maya Stange, stole the show, and she was up against some great actors including Rufus Sewell (who did an in-depth emotional, yet quiet, performance).  Note: This film is about a very spunky lady, during WW2, and therefore might not appeal to all men.  Also received fine service via Amazon (as usual!).",1250812800,4,410,5.181818181818182
