All the episodes are worthwhile, but in particular the episode on design innovations during wartime covers material that is neglected or ignored by nearly all design history texts; it's a great supplement for folks studying design history.",1485043200,,293,5.391304347826087

8429225,5,B004H0ZH84,All design schools around the world (as well as industrial designers) should own a copy. It's so good! I just wished there had been more.,1390867200,,137,4.52
8429226,5,B004H0ZH84,"This is really fascinating for anyone interested in how we get the things we use. I admit I am interested in the history of technology, and this is a really good mix of the ideas, the times, and the people who designed the world we live in today.",1386979200,,246,4.145833333333333
8429227,5,B004H0ZH84,This BBC documentary (in five 45 minute long parts) about design is highly recommended to anyone interested in design and the consumer world. For students of design it is a must.,1374796800,,178,4.774193548387097
8429228,5,B004H0ZH84,"I watched this series on the Smithsonian Channel. It was awesome. I was surprised how much I learned about design. I'm a software developer and I was interested in the way design can really make a difference in the feelings people have about objects. The series draws many parallels between industrial design and software design.

Now I have it on DVD so I can get inspiration anytime!",1325289600,,385,4.746268656716418
8429229,5,B004H0ZH84,this is by far the most comprehensive and unbiased history of the modern design ever.  I loved the segment about design and war and also the considerations about the future of industrial design x environment,1313366400,7,207,4.914285714285715
8429230,5,B004H0ZH84,"I came across this series on the infotainment system while flying between the U.S. and Hong Kong.  Being an engineer with past experience designing consumer products I found the series to be a brilliant historical account of industrial design post WWII.  I purchased a copy for a former colleague and he subsequently purchased 4 copies to distribute throughout his company as a teaching tool for marketing-types and others who are impacted by industrial design decisions.

If you're someone who has a sense of curiosity about the products that surround us and the formative personalities that shape(d) so many things we buy today (iPods, Walkmen, stacking chairs) then this series is guaranteed to be an interesting watch.

Congrats to the BBC for yet another outstanding series.",1308700800,14,779,5.208
