The shows might be just a tad under the quality of previous seasons...or I'm getting to able to predict the way these writers think, but Nessa is still pure gold, and Mike and Gwen and Dave great unsung supporting cast to the main characters of Gavin and Stacey. I'll watch another season if one turns up, for sure.",1360540800,,485,4.5227272727272725

Smithy has some really touching (albeit tiny) moments with his son as the series progresses and even at the grand sentimental finale of it all the writers still get laughs in, while the characters are being frank and honest.

Well written and a satisfying conclusion that will have you smiling. You just want the best for them!",1293926400,,530,4.510416666666667

It's nice to see the familiar, likeable characters;you have to feel for them, given the superficiality of the tired old lines they get to mouth, and the tedious, hackneyed situations they find themselves in.
By all means try to catch the first two series, but don't bother with this one.",1276387200,,403,4.611111111111111

I normally do not do very well with British humour.  I Love stuff like Mel Brooks and old Borsch Belt comedy.  However, I have found this to be a gem.  I so wish I had gone to see James Corden at the West End live.

1114477,4,753054022X,"I enjoyed this season, and when it ended I watched episodes of Horne and Corden stand up comedy show on BBC and even watched episodes of 20 Things to Do Before You're Thirty, I watched them both since I wanted to see more of Mathew Horne's acting independent of Gavin and Stacey. Horne and Corden reminded me of comedy shows on Comedy Central, like Key & Peele and Inside Amy Schumer, where they both write and perform in various sketches. Anyways, I enjoyed watching Gavin and Stacey since they bring the baggage that is their family.  I just liked watching a show about typical everyday, normal people. I gave it four stars for the development of the characters across the seasons, its ability to find humor in everyday simple life, and the writing. I felt that it ended to soon, though it finished well. I also enjoyed watching Gavin (Horne) and Smithy (Corden) stand up in Horne and Corden, which resembles many comedy shows on Comedy Central. If you enjoyed Gavin & Stacey you should look into 20 Things to do Before You're Thirty which also features a character acted by Mathew Horne. I enjoy watching movies/shows on Amazon prime because of the high quality of streaming which usually isn't interrupted or sluggish. Especially, for watching shows that are a few years old like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The XFiles. All around good show, also if your interested in my science fiction shows from BBC you should also look into Orphan Black.",1419811200,,1446,4.715415019762846

I have watched this light but emotional show on Roku so I don't have to get up and down changing discs. I warn you that there are some silly moments cut recently, most noticeably where Smithy and his sister rap. Not vital to the story but I love to watch Gavin become annoyed or impatient. That's part of his character we need to see, as far as I am concerned.
  I love to watch these on a rainy day or when I need a good laugh. Like a conversation with an old friend, you can count on getting a few good laughs and a warm feeling from Gavin and Stacey. I subtracted a star because Nessa became more surly for no visible reason in season 3. And we never did find out about THE FISHING TRIP.",1411776000,,828,4.0426829268292686

1114574,5,753054022X,"I am very critical of any performance and I'm not too easy to please. Almost a year ago I said, ""Enough of this garbage on American TV,"" and just got rid of it. Unbearable, low budget reality shows and my favorite stations are not what they once were. Cooking channels are about competition and celebrity, home improvement stations have changed to low-budget apartment and house hunting and history stations are now featuring Larry the Cable Guy. Enough!
 All that said, I finished the third season of ""Gavin and Stacey"" about a week ago and it feels like I just said goodbye to dear friends. I loved every single character on this show and the writing was clever and seldom predictable. How can you not fall in love with Nessa and hope that she and Smithy, an unlikely pair, end up together? Without giving anything away, as I approached the end of the final episode, I prayed that they didn't choose a happy Hollywood ending and I was not let down, yet I was supremely satisfied. Oh, I suppose there were times in which Stacey was so fervently going in one direction with her emotions (be it over acting, writing or directing) that you'd have to be pretty daft not to know what was going to happen next but it didn't matter. Her character was entertaining beyond any weakness in the storyline. And everyone should have a Gavin in their life. EVERYONE! I loved every single character whether I was supposed to or not. OMG, Pammy! Smithy's sister! The love/hate couple! Bryn! All of them!
 Obviously, I strongly recommend this feel-good sitcom. Try not to binge on this show. Spread it out over the course of a few weeks because, like an excellent novel, you are going to be sorry when it's over.",1411084800,,1696,4.612582781456954

My favourite character has to be Gavin's Mum, ""Pam"". She cracks me up. Being Irish and British, I understand the lingo and miss it very much. All of the characters are unique and hilarious. It's so true to life and real that one can identify with the characters and families. Once you get a dose, you'll be screaming for more. Wish there were more episodes.

1114618,3,753054022X,Gavin and Stacy is a very funny show. It's a little difficult for Americans to understand some of the Welsh actors or get some of the jokes but still well worth watching as it's well acted and different from anything on US TV.

Family and friends continue to complicate the lives of the title couple in wacky and entertaining ways.  We get to know the friends better including Smithy and Vanessa who are made for each other but resist the connection.  Stacey's Uncle Bryn continues to amuse in his efforts to be one of the boys.  The last episode seemed to be incomplete as the advertised resolution of the fishing trip story didn't happen.",1398297600,,565,4.73469387755102

It's set in Wales and England, where Stacey and Gavin are from, respectively - and is about their relationship and the intertwining of the lives of their friends and families.  Character development is brilliant and while the story line is also quite good, I think the characters were even more so. Raunchy humor at times, mixed with just enough sweetness to be one of the more endearing shows I've seen in a long while.  I was thoroughly entertained and didn't want it to end.

Smithy's robot dance is still funny as ever, and dare I say that Stacey is even a little bolder than she once was.

While we never actually find out what happened on the now infamous fishing trip, we still feel like we are in a good place with all concerned. If this show does get legs in its American version, I do hope Ruth Jones takes a very active hand and perhaps allows us to learn more about Nessa. She is the lynch pin of the show. You never know what will come out of her mouth and G & S fans were treated to some cameos that perhaps American viewers might not have picked up on.

For American audiences, there aren't may portions of the show which require any kind of subtitles, even the local Welch lingo is easily understood.

I found myself literally laughing out loud. Not a giggle, not a smile...but out loud laughing. This is a romantic comedy which is enhanced by extended family, extended friends and leads you to become more and more entwined in the lives surrounding ""Gavin and Stacey"".

Gavin plays well off of his 'mate' Smiffy, who plays off of Gavin's Mom and Dad, who play off of their odd matched neighbors - then there is Stacey, her Mom and Uncle ( my personal favorite) and how they play off of Stacey's best 'mate' 'Nessa -- and the rest unfolds before your eyes episode by episode.

I watch it very often, sometimes even just in the background.
I also love Amazon Prime. In fact, one of the main reasons I have a Prime membership is so I can put G&S on whenever I want. (The complete, unedited G&S.)

HOWEVER...sometime in the last few weeks the streaming version was edited to exclude at least one musical number in Season 3 (the Smithy/Smithy Kanye rap). Likely the musical parts in the other seasons are now edited out. It's really too bad b/c the U.S. DVDs aren't complete either. The only possible way for Americans to see the complete G&S now is to get a blu-ray player and then get the region free blu-ray version from amazon.co.uk--but actually i'm not even sure THAT version is complete.

As Lady Catherine would say: ""I'm quite put out!""

I've sent feedback about this to Amazon Prime but I doubt they can do anything to get the content back. I thought I'd let you guys know that you are missing out on key scenes of ""comedy gold.""

1114906,5,753054022X,"Gavin & Stacey is so amazing! I can watch it and rewatch it so many times. It's one of those shows that pulls you in and makes you feel like part of the family. The humor is spot on... I'm not British or Welsh. You really don't have to be from the UK to think it's funny. There are some references I definitely don't get-- but it's also really interesting learning about the differences between Essex and Wales. IT COULDN'T TAKE PLACE ANYWHERE ELSE! It's relevant but I just think this show is so perfect as is. (Why do we Americans have to remake everything??)

The show is a great combination of funny, romantic, and sweet. There's something really true and sentimental to it-- in a good way! Plus it has moments that feel so real and true to life, and others that are more absurd-- it has a wide range. I think it also appeals to a wide audience. I love the way the kids party with their parents. It really shows the way families and circles are built. It's a wonderful coming together story that shows it isn't always easy bringing different people together.

Pam is hilarious... and eventually the story really becomes- Nessa & Smithy-- which is brilliant. Nessa is amazing! Amazing catch phrases. I love love love this show. I'm so glad I watched it. There's something so unique and lovely about Gavin & Stacey. After watching it, I just feel like it stays with me. A little piece of it has attached itself and when I watch I can't help wishing I could spend christmas with the family or go to Capriccios! Best show I have watched all year. Alexis Bledel as Stacey... NO. I'd love to see THIS Gavin & Stacey come back. That would be crackin'!

I loved it, a comedy from across the pond that entertained the stages, awkward moments, pinnacle and poignant emotions of a relationship. The acting troop was full of character variety, whilst Gavin and Stacey were the focal point, the supporting characters added to the series story line, branching out with real-life character flaws that you would recognize in your own life circle of friends and family. Gavin and Stacey is a fresh approach to a love story. I applaud the producers for not creating another sci-fi, stuffy aristrocratic drama, police or murder mystery program.

Smithy (Corbin) and Nessa (Jones) are priceless, but characters like Rob Bryden's OCD neighbor, the unashamedly lascivious grandma next door and  Gavin's amiable but bovine mates are a delight. There is an overall frank unsentimental sweetness to the story which is a rare pleasure. Reminded me of Mike Leigh's best work.",1364515200,,357,5.375
1114959,5,753054022X,"Hilarious, fresh and surprisingly heart warming.
Keeping my fingers crossed for season 4!
Defiantly the best comedy I have seen in a long time.",1364515200,,143,5.0
1114960,5,753054022X,"Season 3, the last season of Gavin and Stacey, is the unfortunate end of a great situation comedy.  Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following--and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle is embodied by Rob Brydon, of The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.  This only negative about this comedy is that there are not 5 more seasons to hang out with these people.  This is a great, funny and very warm ensemble show.",1364169600,,2849,4.891891891891892
1114961,5,753054022X,"Good cast of quirky characters, which are still identifiable.  There is a bit of each of us in these characters.  Contagious! Some American to Brit translation needed, but is very accessible to just about anyone.",1363824000,,212,5.0285714285714285

1114963,5,753054022X,"Wanting more from last season, there were pulls on heart strings as Cavin and Stacy work out the difficulty of living with his parents, then moving to where Stacy's family is from. Nessa and her baby's father pull them even harder while the grins and laughs of life make this an amazing but not stupid sit com.",1362009600,,310,4.456140350877193
