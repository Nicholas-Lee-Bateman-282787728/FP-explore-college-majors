2694178,5,B000KLRPP2,"I had some similar thoughts (as some of the older commentators here) after watching the original version that came out a few years ago.  This new release however is like day and night from the original one.  Not only it has some incredible and never seen footage, the story flows very well.  I truly enjoyed watching this movie and will watch it again many times in the future for inspiration and to feel just a bit closer to this magnificent being that he was.",1256515200,7,461,4.464285714285714

This is a wonderful production filled with amazing photographs and interviews of eminent meditation masters from across the Tibetan pantheon.
It is a beautifully presented story of an incredible and inspiring person.
People of all religious traditions will find something to celebrate in this inspiring video.",1256256000,2,440,5.3
2694180,5,B000KLRPP2,Just got my new Recalling a Buddha dvd. The new information interviews and extras are wonderful. For Buddhists this film is a must have without a doubt. For non-buddhists it will be a fascinating insight into Tibet and into one of the greatest spiritual teachers of all time. Thank you Gregg Eller!,1256256000,,298,4.75
2694181,1,B000KLRPP2,"This documentary proves that to have a camcorder, good will and a good subject is not enough to make an interesting movie. Poor menu, boring  montage, endless slide show and dull narration. Only for devoted.",1176508800,6,207,4.914285714285715
2694182,3,B000KLRPP2,"I was very anxious to view this DVD, having had the great fortune to take refuge with His Holiness, the Sixteenth Karmapa.  However, my viewing was marred by problems with the audio on the DVD: in several places, there was no sound during voice-overs and interviews.  I am ordering a replacement, but I am wondering if anyone else experienced this problem or if it was simply a problem with the copy I purchased.",1168992000,8,412,4.63013698630137
2694184,3,B000KLRPP2,"While I enjoyed many segments in this rare treat something important was missing. I can't understand that the director didn't include interviews with important students of the 16. Karmapa, Hannah and Ole Nydahl.
Not including them seems to me that he takes a certain stand in the following ""Karmapa controversy"" about the recognition of his reincarnation. For the uninformed: there are 2 candidates. Hannah and Ole Nydahl were his students who spent considerable time with him and would undoubtedly have contributed invaluable memories about their beloved teacher. They were not just listening in but have transported his teachings to the West and continue to do so. (Hannah passed away in 2007)
Lama Ole continues to this day to travel the world, teaching and creating Buddhist centers. He founded Diamond Way Buddhism under the spiritual guidance of the 17. Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje and Shamar Rinpoche.",1270339200,3,908,5.268965517241379
2694185,5,B000KLRPP2,"This is a very moving and beautifully researched film about His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa, especially for all those, who did not have the good fortune to meet Him. It is also very timely, since His Holiness the Seventeenth Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje has visited the USA for the first time in 2009 and is about to visit Europe in June 2010.",1268611200,,346,4.596774193548387

2694187,5,B000KLRPP2,"The provocative, insightful interviews from numerous Rinpoches and live footage of the 16th Karmapa are perfectly blended in this DVD to awaken a real experience of devotion and transmission within the Kagyu lineage. I've watched it alone, with buddhist friends, and with non-buddhist friends and its been a big hit each time!  Highly recommended!",1264464000,,347,5.425925925925926
2694188,5,B000KLRPP2,"Since most of the prior reviews assume some knowledge of this film's topic, I thought I'd provide some background in my own review, for those that need it (if you don't, skip to the end for my bottom line assessment.)

This is a documentary film about the Sixteenth Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpei Dorje, within the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. 'Karmapa' is the title for the head of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, one of four main schools. The sixteenth Karmapa lived from 1924 to 1981, and is universally recognized amongst Tibetan Buddhists, and particularly practitioners within the Kagyu school, as one of the most important and influential teachers of the modern age. He played an extraordinary role in the development of Tibetan Buddhism within the West, by traveling to the U.S. at the request of his student, Chogyam Trungpa, and conducting the sacred 'Black Crown' or 'Vajra Crown' ceremony for thousands of people.

In Recalling a Buddha, interviews with those who studied with or knew the Karmapa are entwined with historical commentary, photography, and documentary footage of him to create a complete history of his life and influence on the West. Many of those interviewed are now well-known within Tibetan Buddhism, such as Tenzin Palmo, one of the first western women to be ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun, and subject of the popular book by Vickie Mackenzie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cave-in-the-Snow-Tenzin-Palmo-s-Quest-for-Enlightenment/dp/1582340455/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cave in the Snow: Tenzin Palmo's Quest for Enlightenment</a>. The interviews cover both individuals' personal reactions to the Karmapa upon interacting with him, and events from his life history, including his exodus from Tibet in 1959.

The most fascinating part of the documentary for me was the footage of the Black Crown ceremony, performed by the sixteenth Karmapa. The Black Crown is a sacred hat and symbol of the Kagyu lineage. According to legend, in a prior lifetime the Karmapa attained one of the highest levels of bodhisattva-hood, and 100,000 dakinis created a crown from the hair on their heads and gave it to him as a gift. On the historical level, the crown is said to be a gift from a Chinese Emporer, who was able to see the field of enlightenment and power residing above the Karmapa's head, and had a physical replica of what he saw created.

The Black Crown ceremony is an empowerment and blessing ceremony consisting of prayer and chanting. The Karmapa places the hat on his head while reciting a mantra and meditating on the Buddha of Compassion, Chenrezig. It is said that anyone witnessing the ceremony has the opportunity to attain the first level of bodhisattvahood within three lifetimes. The sixteenth Karmapa performed this ceremony several times in the United States during his visits for thousands of people, and it is considered to have been a powerful transmission of the dharma in the West. Invaluable footage of one of these occasions is included.

Overall, this film will probably be of most interest to those already somewhat familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, and particularly those interested in the Kagyu lineage. Although anyone interested in the history of Buddhism in America might also want to check it out, because the sixteenth Karmapa (and many of his students) were and are a major influence in the U.S. For those populations, this is a five-star film. But it is not an introduction to Buddhism or anything of that nature, so as long as you know what you're getting, you will appreciate this very much (and may watch that Black Crown ceremony over and over!)",1263427200,18,3662,5.231686541737649
2694189,5,B000KLRPP2,This is a wonderful documentary that gives us the rare opportunity to see and hear not only the XVI Karmapa but also many great Tibetan masters. Thank you.,1260921600,4,155,4.571428571428571
2694190,4,B000KLRPP2,"I tend to shy away from ""spiritual"" movies, fearful that they will be syrupy. I was delighted to find that this documentary was not. It's full of personal accounts of the 16th Karmapa, with engaging detail, photographs and, to me, some really powerful moments. I especially enjoyed accounts from Tenzin Palmo and Ponlop Rinpoche, and the video of the black hat ceremony. I think the movie would be particularly appropriate to anyone who has a connection with or curiousity about the Karmapa.",1259625600,2,491,5.0
2694191,5,B000KLRPP2,"Gregg Eller has hit a home run with this film! Extensive archival footage combined with interviews with several high lamas help to make this a must-see DVD for all Tibetan Buddhists. Eller has an uncanny ability to elicit relevant responses during interviews. And his ability to choose powerful material during the editing process is inspiring. Lamas featured include all four of the Karmapa's ""Heart Sons (Shamar, Tai Situ, Gyaltsap, and Jamgon Kongtrul, Rinpoches), along with Ponlop, Trungpa, and Tenga, Rinpoches and many others. And the Extras DVD makes this purchase an extraordinary value!",1259020800,,596,5.419354838709677
2694192,5,B000KLRPP2,This is a wonderful film about about the transitioning of great teachings from Tibet to the West. Not only does it capture the lofty reverence which the Karmapa so inspired but also a sense of the urgent need for us all to generate kindness and compassion in this life. His Holiness emanates such brilliance in living the dharma and this is profoundly accessible here. I wondered how much more we could achieve if we could improve our focus like the many wonderful lamas in this beautiful film. Their suffering in Tibet and the joy which they emanate can only be reconciled with an appreciation of the buddhadharma which can only increase as we view this material.

2694193,5,B000KLRPP2,"Very inspiring, and a worthy companion to "" The Lion's Roar"". All of the shortcomings of the earlier version appear to have been ironed out, and I experienced no technical difficulties whatsoever with my copy. Well done and thank you Gregg!",1257811200,,240,4.878048780487805

8158099,1,B000KLRPP2,"To start off, I will write by saying that the film and filmmaker did a great service to the memory and legacy of a great Tibetan teacher, His Holiness the 16th Gyalwang Karmapa. Having been a student-participant in the great tradition of the Karma Kagyu School of Buddhism, it was a joy and an honor to be in the presence of great memories  of this giant of modern day Buddhist teachings.
My only small complaint was not with the film nor the filmmaker but the copy I received, which I believe was a copy of a copy--- a bootleg in my estimation. It omitted the ""extra footage"" which was the reason why I purchased my copy to begin with. I didn't know it when I purchased, but found out only when I went  looking for it on the DVD. I did confer with the filmmaker directly and he promised to correct the problem.",1429056000,,811,4.294117647058823
8158100,5,B000KLRPP2,"Excellent.  I liked this movie because it has some first hand accounts as well as footage that is wonderful, uplifting, inspiring and the whole movie in general to me is absolutely priceless in terms of its historical significance.  This is a good movie to watch and revisit.  Enjoyable and enlightening.",1425772800,,304,5.04
8158101,2,B000KLRPP2,"This documentary does not do the 16th Karmapa justice, and there is very little footage of the 16th Karmapa. The overall quality of the documentary is fairly poor. There are some good interviews with those who were with the 16th Karmapa, but also some that really don't help (and maybe even hurt) the image of the 16th Karmapa (as I understand it). Looking forward to future films that better represent a living buddha.",1397433600,,419,4.7534246575342465
8158102,5,B000KLRPP2,"""Recalling A Buddha"" is a film that does a marvelous job of helping the viewer to both feel and understand how the Sixteenth Karmapa was regarded in his own cultural context - by the Tibetans who grew up around him - as well as how he affected those who were encountering him for the first time in the West. What is a ""Karmapa""? What is Tibetan Buddhism all about? If you have any curiosity about these things, this is a perfect film to watch. It will give you a glimpse into the minds and personalities of some of the most important Tibetan Buddhist teachers of our time, and also into the causes and conditions that brought Tibetan Buddhism to the West. It will surprise you, and it will make you laugh. Most importantly, it will leave you with more questions than you started with, and you will watch it again and again.

I can't recommend it highly enough.",1328659200,,860,4.443037974683544
8158103,4,B000KLRPP2,"When I came across this film, I had little to no understand of the practice of Buddhism in the Americas, let alone any knowledge of Karmapa XVI.  This candid production features interviews of some the people who were closest to Karmapa throughout his life and even up to the moments preceding his transcendance.

It's remarkable to hear the stories of those who followed, supported and learned from Karmapa on a daily basis.  Each person interviewed reflects so graciously and openly on the film maker's open ended questions. I felt as they spoke, seeing the expressions on their faces and the depth of their eyes, it was almost as if they were in Karmapa's presence again as they relived those moments in this colorful,  informative and touching story. Clearly this peaceful, funny, enlightened man has had a tremendous and lasting effect on many, many lives.

The photographs and video collections are priceless - I also felt the music and narration were perfectly suited to the subject.

I recommend this film to anyone interested in learning more about the spread of Buddhism in America and certainly to anyone who was living at the time when Karmapa was traveling Europe and the states. Also to those who are studying Buddhism in school or in a spiritual group.  We're planning a group screening for our Sanga. Enjoy it!

Namaste'

8158104,4,B000KLRPP2,some of the footage on this video is priceless. my only Quibble is that it includes no footage of Lama Ole Nydahl.
