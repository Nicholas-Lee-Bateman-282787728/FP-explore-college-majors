4042843,5,B002ZVTSHS,"I found this workout after trying a few different cardio workouts, and this one is by far my favorite. I am an ex- competitive swimmer, so I am used to hard workouts, and after not swimming for a while and wanting to get back into shape i began looking for a good cardio workout that was a full body workout at the same time, I've tried Jillian Michaels, and some dance cardio workouts, and I either got bored or confused by the choreography. This workout was the perfect one for me, its challenging and a good workout, but also helps you build up to being able to do all the full sets in the workout by just doing what you can during the sets. and it moves fairly quickly so I don't get bored, and the moves are simple basic moves that really get your heart rate up, and still provide a good overall basic toning workout. The trainer is great, and motivating to do what you can. It is a really good workout.",1309046400,,908,4.224137931034483
4042844,3,B002ZVTSHS,"Generally I like cardio videos that have simple repetative moves that tire me out and build up stamina.  One of my favorites is Jillian Michael's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism workout.  This video is similiar in that the moves are dead simple and its a rigourous cardio workout but I'm not sure I'll be doing it again for several reasons.

- Even for me it was too repetative. Basically each circuit is made up of two moves and then 30 seconds of jump roping.  So you do move a, move b, then jump for 30 seconds.  Then again.  Then again.  I felt like I spent the whole 50 minutes jumping in place.  Eventually I got so bored with this I started doing jumping jacks and other moves just for variety.

- I did find the instructor to be motivating and I liked her style of counting down.  But throught the whole workout she keeps yelling ""half way there!"".  I know she means half way through that specific set of whatever but I found it to be confusing and annoying.  I only want to hear half way there when I'm half way through the full workout.

- Lastly, this is just knit picky but I was distracted by both the instructor and Brooklyn's pants.  They were ill fitting and I wanted to pull them up.

On the plus side I did feel like I got a good workout after the 50 minutes and I felt it the day after.  I liked the energy of the the intsructor and Brooklyn and I liked the city veiws.",1303776000,6,1384,4.20532319391635
4042845,5,B002ZVTSHS,This workout DVD is a very good workout and leaves no room for lazies! I had to do it a few times before I could do the whole thing. It was worth it purchasing because I am starting to notice results. Holla!,1299024000,3,207,3.9523809523809526
4042846,4,B002ZVTSHS,"i was surprised at the intensity of this workout. i am in pretty good shape. i've been doing p 90x workouts daily for several months. many ""women's magazine"" workouts (i.e. women's health, shape) don't leave me sweating so i figured this one would not do a whole lot. however, i broke a sweat. the workout is repetitive, progressive intervals. the exercises are vigorous without being overly high impact.
brooklyn decker is clearly the focus. i could have done without her status reports throughout the video. quite frankly, i didn't really care how she was doing. the rest periods could have been a little shorter as well. the instructor talks a lot throughout, but she is not overly chatty. no cheesy words of encouragement here.
some people may feel this is boring. however, i liked the quality of the exercises. it gets the job done in a very straightforward manner.",1298073600,5,870,4.845637583892618
4042847,5,B002ZVTSHS,"I have yet to find a good arm workout that is equivalent to this one. Jade Alexis (the trainer) encourages you to do the workout daily. If it's done that way, then result are sure to be seen. My arms were very strong when I did this workout consistently. I was amazed to see muscles in my non writing arm. Also the cardio is great. They use boxing exercises to get the heart pumping. It's fun and fulfilling. It's a great workout. I highly recommend it.",1296950400,3,453,4.27906976744186
4042848,5,B002ZVTSHS,"I have done tons of workout videos as well as worked out with personal trainers and spent plenty of hours at the gym and I must say that the two workout segements in this video rank in my top three.  The format is perfect for quick and long-lasting calorie burn: warm-up than five, ten, and 15-minute intervals of three different excersises grouped together with a break in between each interval to bring the heart rate down.  There is a blend of upper and lower body movements that engage the core (abs), and there is also quite a bit of jumping (excellent quick calorie burner) so get ready for that.  The trainer, Jade Alexis, is a really good instructor and motivator.  It really does seem as if she is personally working out with the audience instead of reading on que.  I have never worked out to a celebrity DVD before, but Brooklyn Decker, just like her trainer, Jade, comes across as being very geniune throughout the workout process.  This workout DVD is a blast and you will not regret it.",1271980800,6,1000,4.558659217877095
4042849,2,B002ZVTSHS,"with 30 bucks i can buy 3 dvd's that do the exact same thing ! shame on elle for that ! plus the chick is way to thin, anorexia like thin, not toned at all",1265155200,5,155,3.4571428571428573
4042850,5,B002ZVTSHS,I bought the 3 DVD set as part of my new year's resolution to focus on fitness and it's been fantastic!  it's fun and easy to incorporate into my morning routine.  it gives me variety so i'm doing something different day to day and it is the real deal - you will feel the workout.  and i love the lifestyle elements they included to make it feel less gym and more fabulous!,1264118400,4,373,4.152777777777778
4042851,5,B002ZVTSHS,"I got the whole Elle Make Better DVD series 2 weeks ago and I am already feeling amazing! The gym is great, but doing this from home everyday has given me tons of energy and more time for hitting the town. Brooklyn is great and I love the trainer's high energy. Its an intense workout but it is way worth it!! Definitely recommend getting your sweat on and there's tons of extras from ELLE's editors (LOVE JOE ZEE) which are really helpful!",1264118400,3,440,4.378048780487805
4042852,5,B002ZVTSHS,"Loved this DVD - the cardio workout was just at my level, and helped me push further than I had gone before. Added this one to my weekly routine, and I'm already feeling the results. Love the workout and the lifestyle pieces - bought the whole series!",1262131200,2,251,4.361702127659575
4042889,4,B002ZVTSHS,"This is one of my favorite vid workouts.  It uses plyometrics (ie. P90X) which is a tough but efficient fat-burner/strength builder. All you need is a set of light hand weights, a yoga mat, and your bottle of water. This workout can be done in a small space so it's great as an ""apartment workout"" as I like to call it.
 At 52, I can't get through the whole workout without huffing and puffing and stopping for a break (especially that stretch of 15 squat-thrusts---killer).  I will tell you this much though: sticking with it and trying my hardest has improved my tone, helped me keep in good cardio shape and has kept my waist and hip fat in check which is hard to do at my age. The training, which is staged on a building rooftop, is run by Jade Alexis who is a statuesquely sculpted woman.  Model, Brooklyn Decker demonstrates the exercises.  There isn't any noticeable music so if you're looking for a dance workout, you probably won't like this one. I do like it though: 1. for its efficiency in getting the job done 2. its simplicity and ease of fitting into a small space, minimal equipment required and it's great if you're short on time.",1342224000,6,1147,4.4688995215311005
4042890,5,B002ZVTSHS,"I have been doing this workout for about a month now and I must say I like it. I have been doing workout 1 one day and 2 the next. Its fast and super easy. There is a lot of jumping involved in this workout, so if you have issues with your knees- this may not be the workout for you. This workout needs a cool down. You really need to stretch after this workout or else you will feel it bad the next day.",1336089600,,404,3.764705882352941
4042891,3,B002ZVTSHS,"The workout itself is pretty average. You will certainly get your heart rate up, however I think that is mostly from the fact that half the workout is jumping up and down. Mostly I found the hosts to be really annoying. They just did not make it fun or interesting, and they did not make me want to keep exercising. Kind of boring....",1329264000,2,334,4.317460317460317
4042892,5,B002ZVTSHS,"I rented this from Amazon to try out.  I do a lot of workout videos...this one is very different from any other video I have used.  They don't do the moves to the music, it just lingers in the background.  The trainer kind of yells at you and that took some time to get used to as well.  I really didn't feel comfortable with the format at first, but I gave it a chance, and I loved the workouts!  They really get your heart rate up and get you sweating.  I had to really focus to push through some of the sets.  Once I was at the point where I didn't feel like I could finish, I actually appreciated the trainers style of motivation.  Give this video a chance if you are focused on burning up the calories!",1328313600,,707,4.072463768115942
4042893,4,B002ZVTSHS,"Definitely not the most intense workout DVD, but a good, heart rate-raising workout for the price.  Instead of short bursts of activity or lots of plyometric activities, there's lots of sustained cardio activity that keeps calories burning throughout the workout.  Even though I never really feel like I was pushed to or beyond my limit in this workout, I did feel it the next day.

20-odd minute workout segments make it good to combine with other 20- to 30-minute workouts.",1326499200,,475,4.9125
4042894,1,B002ZVTSHS,"EXACTLY like Jillian Michaels philosphy of workouts. Fitness is like a pap smear, necessary and completly unfun. If I craved boredom enough to enjoy this, I would just go for a run, or hop up on the hamster wheels at the gym. Miserable, unchallenging, uninteresting, and ruined my day!",1325030400,3,285,4.836734693877551
4042895,4,B002ZVTSHS,"You can do these two workouts on a space just wide enough to accommodate a yoga mat. It's the only video I have I can do in my bedroom or a reasonably sized hotel room. Doesn't take equipment beyond a couple 5 pound weights, but I do this video in my home gym right by my heavy bag, and I just slip on boxing gloves instead of picking up the weights and hit the bag through the punching sequences, which adds a little fun. Lots of jumping, not for people with knee issues at all, but they break up the monotony of endless jump rope with enough variety that it goes by. Straight forward cardio workout, useful, gets the heart rate up. I rented this but I'll buy it.",1322870400,6,664,4.155038759689923
4042896,4,B002ZVTSHS,"Hmmm I burned a good 500 calories (doing workout one and two) this will be keeper for me. If you can do Jillian Michaels you can do this it is similar but not exactly the same. If your the type of person that needs to have a super fun workout and lose motivation doing repetive moves then go to something like zumba, this workout is not the place. This is a workout for people who want to sweat, have genuine workout and does not care about the extra stuff and motivated by plan old working out, not by the music, the trainer, and different types of exercise moves. The music is not great, the trainer is kind of annoying and doesn't focus on the audience, your jumping most of both workouts and but its a really good cardio WORKOUT. You will sweat, burn calories with basic interval training moves.",1312761600,3,799,4.369127516778524
4042897,4,B002ZVTSHS,"Although the workout is really hard to keep up with, I feel great afterwards.
The setting is nice and the sometimes annoying instructor is really motivating.
Good dvd if you want to get sweaty!",1311724800,,193,4.705882352941177
4042898,5,B002ZVTSHS,"There are 2 workouts on this dvd and you can either do them seperate or together.
For me, just doing one works my butt off! I exercise a lot and even though i have done this workout many times...i still end up with sweat dripping down my face.
You can really tell Brokyln and her trainer have great chemstry. some of the other people who wrote reviews said the trainer (Jade) was annoying but i actually like her! If you end up like this dvd i would tell you to get the other 2 dvds in the series. (sculpting and yoga) I love the whole series and you will defentily get results. Also, where they shoot the workout is really pretty! and in all three of the dvds there is a lot of bonus videos on how to eat better, pack better, and just many tips that i have found helpful! I hope you enjoy it!",1310515200,,793,4.089743589743589
8385404,4,B002ZVTSHS,"I lost 14 lbs doing this workout over a span of 3 months.
I had been doing T-25 (a Shaun T workout similar to Insanity) for almost a year and didn't see results as fast as I did with this workout in just 3 months. I didn't even do both! I just did one each day 5 days a week, switching the 1st and second workout throughout the week. It was enough change so my body didn't hit a plateau. It's progressive, and intense. A FULL BODY, cardio workout. I love the Squat thrusts in the 1st workout. That move has actually made me lose several inches around my waist.

I don't usually write reviews unless I feel passionately about something, and this I can assure you I am passionate about.  Please give this workout a try, I guarantee you will see results in the first week!!! I'm just a simple woman from seattle who works a 9-5 and trust me if it fits into my schedule, and I can do the video in my tiny little studio apartment, trust me you can do this video!",1457049600,3,957,4.139784946236559
8385405,5,B002ZVTSHS,I was looking for a high intensity workout and this was all worth a buck $1.99.  Someone once told me if your not breaking a sweat you might won't to rethink your workout routine. I tend to get bored really quick so this kept me focused and ready to work,1417132800,2,254,4.08
8385406,1,B002ZVTSHS,Embarrassingly unprofessional.,1410307200,,30,14.5
8385407,5,B002ZVTSHS,"I truely love the workout. I have did both of them not together yet just separate. But I think with as much jumping that you are doing you need a cool down and stretch to stretch the muscles that worked hard. But I workout with Cathe and some other instructors so I pretty much know how to stretch them out on the days that I just do this workout. What I do is I like working out for about an hour 5 to 6 days a week so when I want to do this workout I will do this one first either cardio 1 or cardio 2 then put in another workout to finish out the other 30 minutes the second workout will have the cool down and stretch. I just think it's odd that there is no stretch. I like Brooklyn she seems really sweet,and her trainer Jade seems nice also. You can choose to do the whole workout straight through or you can choose to do them separate. Each workout is about 28 minutes.",1391990400,,876,3.9829545454545454
8385408,4,B002ZVTSHS,These 2 workouts are good for quick cardio sessions. Simple choreography made it fun for me also.  Together they make a great workout.,1374451200,,134,4.826086956521739
8385409,4,B002ZVTSHS,"This is an awesome workout! It really gets my heart pumping and the sweat pouring. The warm up and workouts are great, but what this video lacks is a cool down.",1362182400,,160,4.193548387096774
8385410,4,B002ZVTSHS,"Super work out. Fun to do, and easy to modify and do in a small space. I would highly recommend this workout.",1360108800,,109,4.0
8385411,4,B002ZVTSHS,"This is a good workout, especially if you have a small space. I like that it's broken up into two segments. I would recommend taking breaks in between each time you do the workout because it's a lot of jumping and can wear on you. But highly recommend.",1357603200,,252,4.270833333333333
8385412,1,B002ZVTSHS,"This video is NOT for people looking for a challenge.  I felt like we were taking more time for breaks than actually working out.  The moves were pretty basic and unoriginal.  After 10 minutes, I was so utterly bored and annoyed with the trainer yelling ""stick with it"" every 10 seconds that I stopped the video and put in an old reliable Jillian Michaels DVD.

If you're looking for a tough workout that will make you drip sweat, my advice is to stick with Jillian.  Sorry ELLE!",1355616000,,479,4.459770114942529
