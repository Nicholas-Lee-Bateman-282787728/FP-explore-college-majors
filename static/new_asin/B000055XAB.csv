Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made.",1355356800,,557,4.6938775510204085
7931044,5,B000055XAB,"Quarte has gone insane after watching the death of his father at the hands of OZ.  Quarte starts to destory colonies with a very powerful gundam, The Gundam they called Zero.  Heero and Trowa are ordered to destory the new mobile suit, but Quarte ends up almost killing Trowa.  After the battle with Heero and Quarte, there is no telling that Trowa is alive or dead.
  The best of the Gundam Wing DVD's!",1022371200,2,403,4.465753424657534
7931045,5,B000055XAB,"What can I say? Episode 25 and 26 of Gundam Wing is the best cliff-hanger I've ever seen in an show (anime or otherwise) ever. You've got Trowa nearly killed, Quatre gone completely insane in an ultra-powerful mind warping mobile suit, heero ready to fight him to the death in the only mobile suit with a shield system, Roamafeller betraying Treize and Lady Une, the rest of the pilots and the scientists running out of air...and sweet mother of mobile suit, that's one awesome ending shot at the end of Episode 25! One of the best battles in the whole series is Heero vs. Quatre, and when Lady Une gets shot...let's just say that I was in shocked disbelief (near tears) over the death of a character that I once loved to hate. If you get only one Gundam Wing dvd, get this one. And watch ""The Gundam They Called Zero"". You won't regret it.",1017100800,3,840,4.425806451612903
7931046,5,B000055XAB,"Gundam Wing is the single most amazing, most revolutionary anime series of all time. Not just the best Chapter in the series of greats, I believe that it has the best animation, music, voice ( even dubbed ), and ends the series perfectly. The final movie was amazing, but on this perticular DVD (if I can remember the episodes right)... is cool... I can't remember... Sorry! I haven't seen the whole series in 2 years. But I do know it it my favorite anime series (as well as Dragonball Z, both have magnificent themes). yeah...",1007596800,,528,4.568421052631579
7931047,5,B000055XAB,"The DVD of Operation 5 is another brilliant installment into the GW saga. It is one of my favourite subplots, with the turn in character of Quatre and his downfall from that loving caring and strong Arab pilot, to the psychotic vengeful killer. We see some of the most tense moments in the entire Gundam Wing series, including the fate of Nanashi, Trowa Barton ('No Name')
The fans of the fighting also get to see new models, including the introduction of the ZERO system; a mind warping and controlling mechanism, installed into the suits to give the pilot the greatest power, yet minimum control over who they should or shouldn't be fighting. Tension builds throughout the entire 5 episodes, a true turning point in the seemingly simple war plot. Now the Gundam Pilots are turning against each other...",1003017600,5,804,4.833333333333333
7931048,5,B000055XAB,"I've heard some of the episodes on this DVD referred to as the ""turning point"" in Gundam Wing, and I must say, I couldn't agree more. In these episodes, while for most of the characters, the battle seems to be edging towards their favor, the exact opposite is happening for Quatre. After the assasination of his father, he swears revenge against the colonies which are arming themselves with weapons, and discovers the blueprints for the never finished Wing Gundam Zero... even if you're not an insane raving lunatic Quatre fan like I am, there are moments centered around ALL the G-Boys (except maybe Wufei). Episode 22 focuses mainly on the Oz characters, and episode 23 on Duo; also, there's a GREAT scene involving Trowa in episode 25 that I believe is a crime to miss. My basic point is that these episodes are ESSENTIAL to the series; a must watch for any fans of Gundam Wing. The only reason I don't currently own it is that it hasn't been released yet, and I'm going to strike as soon as it's out...",974851200,21,1007,4.569060773480663
