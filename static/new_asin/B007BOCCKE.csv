8514044,5,B007BOCCKE,Well the movie itself was pretty awful as expected from crappy 70s B movies but it came right on time without any damage.,1453939200,2,121,4.304347826086956
8514045,2,B007BOCCKE,"Half hearted try at a horror film which doesn't fully commit to being one, while not committing to any other genre either.  Plot has people at an ill defined vacation retreat consisting of plenty of pretty women, most of whom come off as unrealistically desperate.  A couple of the male characters are fairly cool especially Albert Popwell, who fans of Clint Eastwood movies will probably recognize from his work in some of the Dirty Harry movies.  Unfortunately his screen time here is limited when the film could've used more of him.  Single Girls does feature a little more of the beautiful Claudia Jennings than you'll see in other films, but her character is rather dim.  She warns others of danger, but has no problem hanging out with her stalker ex fianc&eacute; who has arrived unannounced.  The film's biggest problem is the finale.  It threatened to be the most tense part of the movie, but the filmmakers abandon the scene before it's even complete.  Overall this is watchable only if you can keep expectations low.",1433548800,8,1026,4.85632183908046
