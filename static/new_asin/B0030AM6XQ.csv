4043063,3,B0030AM6XQ,"This 2 disc set comprises, in the original transmission order, the first 14 episodes of this hard-hitting, at times brutal, series from 1957. There were eventually well over 100 episodes made over a period of three years. The violence does not seem so extreme now, unlike the propensity for men to wear hats indoors, but the police still do seem to draw revolvers, and use them, with remarkably little provocation. Count Basie's music for the programme was written for the second series, so is not featured here, except in a slightly different arrangement, over the menu card. Marvin, loose -limbed, agile, often gliding like a panther, impresses: he has to play a number of different assumed roles during the course of the episodes, and his ability to suggest different characters through movement and gesture suggests a major star in the making. Interestingly, one episode features a young Angie Dickinson, years before she joined him in the two films whose violence was a natural development of this show, namely The Killers, and Point Blank. So, there is much to enjoy, and this without mentioning the location shooting in Chicago.
There are problems. I knew the manufacturers of these discs had not been given access to the original materials, and had been forced to collect prints from varied private sources, so as expected, print quality is very variable, from quite reasonable, to barely tolerable. Some episodes streamed on the Internet seem better. But the real problem was the discs themselves. Both of my Region 1 players from the first refused to play them, and it was only after thoroughly cleaning each disc half a dozen times with three different cleaning materials that I persuaded them to consistently play. Even now they occasionally stick, although they had appeared clean when removed from their packaging. It's a series well worth exploring if you like period film noir, or cop shows, and the half hour stories waste little time, are concise, and well constructed. But be prepared for difficulties.",1368230400,6,2021,5.053892215568863
4043064,3,B0030AM6XQ,Considering this series was made in the late 1950's the reproduction of sound and picture is OK  and I will still enjoy the series.,1367712000,,131,4.458333333333333

4043066,4,B0030AM6XQ,"M Squad was a popular item in the 1960s.  T he collection seems to be some of the earlier TV shows rather than the later, mote flamboyant episodes.  Entertaining viewing.",1352419200,,170,4.633333333333334

4043068,3,B0030AM6XQ,"Bought this today (new) from a book reseller - usually 50% the price of the original book cost - (hint).  Anyway only paid $4.00.  Great stories, as stated the audio could be better, but part of the fun is watching Lee Marvin - that guy was nails.  Good shows and couldn't beat the price.",1271980800,4,288,4.296296296296297

8385561,4,B0030AM6XQ,"M Squad was the grand daddy of the good cop vs the bad guy vs the police rules. This show was so far over Dragnet or Peter Gunn. If Lee Marvin had Peter Gunn's jazz-influenced music of Henry Mancini. And drove a Plymouth Sport Fury convertible with a car phone, the would have went longer. Watching M Squad makes me think of Boush and all those police shows that followed. Just wish I had bought the compete set.",1482969600,,412,4.294871794871795
8385562,4,B0030AM6XQ,"lee marvin makes m squad a very good half hour crime drama. in fact without marvin it would be a mediocre black and white series.my advice to any one thinking about purchasing m squad, do it just for lee marvins performances.",1420588800,,225,4.512195121951219
8385563,4,B0030AM6XQ,I enjoyed this DVD.  I love the old shows of the 50's and 60's. I was hoping that this DVD had the episode with Robert Fuller episode on it but I liked it anyway.  I have been collecting a lot of Robert Fuller movies and TV Series shows. Thank you.,1419897600,,248,3.94
8385564,4,B0030AM6XQ,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  While I agree the quality is not great, I was still able to watch a 1950's series with Lee Marvin.  If you like Lee Marvin you will want this DVD set.",1416355200,,178,3.9166666666666665
8385565,5,B0030AM6XQ,"I remember watching this when I was but five years' old and hanging on every moment.  Now, I can appreciate the hard-boiled approach Marvin takes in each episode.  Even when the story is obvious, it still has that grit that you expect from that era.  And for the $8 I paid for the season - you can't go wrong!",1404086400,,309,4.203389830508475
8385566,5,B0030AM6XQ,"Lee Marvin is best known for his Westerns.  He shines as a tough, Chicago detective on a special squad.  Unusual plots leave you at the edge of your seat.  It's a sleeper,  but a good one.",1392422400,,188,4.138888888888889
8385567,1,B0030AM6XQ,"I remember this series from way back and how me and my father loved it. So I was looking forward to this DVD. What a let down, the quality is terrible. I understand a show this old would not be Blu Ray quality, but the people responsible for putting this DVD out should be ashamed,I wonder if they would buy it, I very much doubt it.",1387670400,4,333,4.0606060606060606
8385568,5,B0030AM6XQ,"One of the best cop shows ever.  Lee Marvin is an amazing actor, and his little nuances and scene-stealing moves and expressions are something to behold.  Fantastic police work and superb acting, more than 50 years after the show was created.",1378166400,,242,4.878048780487805
8385569,5,B0030AM6XQ,"It's great to take a trip back to a time when Police acted like POLICE! There were Consequences for breaking the Laws! You couldn't claim it was Your Childhood ,etc!  There was a difference! Lee Marvin was always the BEST! Some are not all that clear but IT is in the 50's? I guess that was the best They could Do?",1377648000,,314,4.147540983606557
