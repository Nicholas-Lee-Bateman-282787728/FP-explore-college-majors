7905261,4,B000007T19,"Charming story indeed.  Baron Pepe Cerafulu gets bored with his wife's over nuturing and nagging ways.  Oh how he yearns for his teenage cousin, Angelina.  Baron does give us some amusing facial gestures.
His schemes to arrange for this divorce are kind of far fetched.  They will certainly have you chuckling especially when the tape recorder fails to catch his wife in the act. Carmello is quite charming in his role as the painter.
The Black and White Cinematography works well depicting Italy several decades ago.  The subtitles are a little out of synch but otherwise this old movie is certainly a goodie.",1049241600,,610,4.883495145631068
7905262,5,B000007T19,"I have never forgotten this movies since I first saw it when it came out in the 1960s.  For years I have described it to friends and then several years ago it was finally released on video.  What a treat to see it again.  Many films don't stand the test of time, but this one does.  Marcello Mastroianni portrays a wealthy, bored Sicilian barone who is as bored with his wife (who sports a slight mustasche), as he is with life.  He catches the eye of a beautiful young woman (no mustasche), and decides he wants to marry her.  Of course divorce is out of the question in Italy, so he concocts an elaborate scheme to kill his wife and win his new love.
Marcello plays the frantic schemer while at the same time suffering the whining self-centeredness of his wife with masterful facial expressions. His ennui and arrogance are visible from the way he smokes his cigarette to the little sucking sounds which occasionally escape from the side of his mouth. You almost become sympathetic to his cause.  The music is superb, and underlies the sense of suspense.
All of the supporting cast is excellent.  Pietro Germi is masterful at ridiculing the upper class, outdated Italian laws and the suffocating layers of structure and tradition in Southern Italy in the 1960s.
Obviously, one of my favorites.  (VHS version).",988588800,17,1311,4.689956331877729
7905263,5,B000007T19,"This is one of those classic 60's Italian films that marks a golden age, as well as defining Marcello Mastroianni as not merely talented but ingenious. It's a dry-witted look at degenerate old wealthy Italians by  some very talented natives. Readers may wonder what's the big deal, why  doesn't hubby just get a divorce? Divorce was not only immoral in Italy, it  was illegal. The hilarity arises not only from Marcello's situation but  from the lengths to which he's willing to go to achieve his goal, as well  as the caricatures (are they really caricatures?) of the other characters.  Marcello is brilliant here and so is the technical end. I gave a copy of  this to my Italian parents and they called me long-distance, still  laughing, to thank me for sending them this classic comedy. The sound track  is a gem, too. This movie is a one-of-a-kind experience, so don't expect a  usual low-level sitcom from this great film.",945302400,13,927,4.773584905660377
