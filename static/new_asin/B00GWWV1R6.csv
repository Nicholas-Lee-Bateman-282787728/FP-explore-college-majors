6121382,4,B00GWWV1R6,"my little boy is a huge monster jam fan. ever since the speed network has gone, we have been watching old episodes on hulu and stuff. so he was really excited about this dvd

it says 2013 but some of the footages are from 2012 season,is that before world finals 14??
i see grave digger 30 year anniversary truck

it consists of 3 sections. main, bonus runs, and inside freestyle
main part is the highlights from televised parts of the monster jam episodes. i've seen a lot of it, so it's not like something you have never seen before. and in general, it has a lot of grave digger runs.

bonus run part is great. no narrations. just cool freestyles like you see when you go to monster jam

inside freestyle is the part interviewing drivers, which was pretty interesting

so, $20 and 2 hours of fun, this is a must have dvd for monster jam fans. my son loves it.  i give 4 stars because this didn't include anything from world finals and we've seen a lot of stuff already on televised episodes",1394755200,,991,4.358695652173913

8628142,4,B00GWWV1R6,The annoying interviews with the driver's on the side of the screen while the action is going on I can do without. I also didn't like the constant onboard camera's either. But the action itself is always good. I would also rather see highlights of the best freestyle in the last two years than some of the lame one's in the same year!,1424736000,,334,4.317460317460317
