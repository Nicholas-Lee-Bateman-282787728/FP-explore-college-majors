1362142,3,B00004W5UV,"A young girl, Judy Landsdowne (Lilli Palmer) inherits a key that is supposed to help her claim her share of a fortune. Dr. Manetta (Leslie Banks) is intent on getting the fortune himself, but in order to do so he needs seven keys to unlock the chamber. Landsdowne is the last person on his list. She is abducted, but her handsome boyfriend, Dick Martin (Romilly Lunge) gets involved. He sneaks into the mansion, rescues his girl, and stops Manetta's evil scheme.

CHAMBER OF HORRORS is an average old-time suspense film. There's a mad doctor who collects torture instruments, a couple of sinister and obedient house servants, a sidekick, and the leading lady's best friend who is only interested in finding herself a man. There has been a crash in recent years to remake classic suspense and horror movies. CHAMBER OF HORRORS is one that is ripe for a remake.",1157155200,,859,4.76510067114094
1362143,2,B00004W5UV,"A murder is found to be connected to a false heir and a secret underground torture chamber. In an old haunted house, Dr. Manetta plans to menace heiress Judy Lansdowne, who is well portrayed by lovely blonde Lilli Palmer in an early role. ""Chamber of Horrors"", an English B-Picture, is plagued by slow pacing, poor writing, and laughable acting. This low-budget British thriller is based on Edgar Wallace's book, ""The Door with Seven Locks"". The year before, ""The Human Monster"", based on another Wallace story, was a big box-office hit. It had starred Bela Lugosi. 1940's ""Chamber of Horrors"" is thought to be a remake of 1932's ""The Most Dangerous Game"". But it's not. The only real connection is that both starred the marvelous Leslie Banks. ""The Most Dangerous Game"", shot in Hollywood on the sets for ""King Kong"", was Banks first of 35 films. Leslie Banks appeared in 2 early Alfred Hitchcock movies, ""Man Who Knew Too Much(1934)"", and
""Jamaica Inn(1939), Hitch's last English film. The debonair actor was a British screen, stage actor, stage director, and producer. Banks owed his scarred face and frozen expression to a paralyzing injury suffered in World War I. He died in 1952. The Roan Group DVD, ""Chamber of Horrors"", features a cast and crew menu, and 19 chapter stops, with no other extras. For a magnificent performance by Leslie Banks in a classic thriller, find ""The Most Dangerous Game"" in DVD and VHS. Unless you're a fervent devotee of master thespian Leslie Banks, there is no point in entering this ""Chamber"" door.",999734400,4,1535,4.907692307692308
1362144,3,B00004W5UV,"Well this is a very hokey movie but well worth watching for all you lovers of the B movies. The copy I have (not from Amazon) is a bit dark so it was hard to view... It's a funny movie, kind of a spoof on detective movies  with an old spooky mansion, a not so poor damsel going there to inherit  money, and a very handsome and dashing if not silly detective who follows  her there for protection. The damsel inherits a key to a fortune but there  are seven that are needed to get into the family tomb and get the treasure.  A large Mute, a cunning and evil looking Dr, and two other family servants  try their best to keep the damsel from getting her inheritance. The title  of the movie comes from the Dr... he has a love of torture devices and  collects them in a small museum on the family manor. The comedy relief is  provided by the side kick of the detective and the damsel's young aunt who  is interested in nothing but finding a man. ;) A very screwy screwball  comedy/suspense. Slow in spots but worth watching.",921110400,8,1020,4.233160621761658
7924818,4,B00004W5UV,"Pretty good 1940's Edgar Wallace British murder-mystery.  A young woman runs afoul of a bunch of no-goods who want an inheritance.  My comments are about the DVDs available.  The Kino DVD is pretty good.  It even has some trailers available.  I think, though, that the Roan Group Archival Entertainment DVD (pictured below) is better quality, but it has no extras.  Unfortunately the Roan version is hard to find.  That version is the one I recommend.",1521849600,,451,4.933333333333334

7924823,4,B00004W5UV,"I remmember seeing this on TV in the 1950s and while I didn't know the  actors it really scared me ,partically the scene where the bad guy was trapped in the iron maiden and the look of terror on his face as the device slowly closed on him sealing his fate was very scary to a young boy like myself ..And I never knew what the movie was called until a few years ago when I found out the name of the movie and who the actors were and when I found it on IMDB a few weeks ago i quickly ordered it and really enjoyed seeing it again and it was good as I remmember it being .And Im glad I purchased it .Thanks again",1417910400,2,610,3.8412698412698414
7924824,5,B00004W5UV,"This is one great old horror/mystery movie. It is a bit slow getting started, but when the action gets to flowing it is great. The main actors are very good. Fact is they are as good as they come. The picture is good sound good. The plot is also very fine just takes a little time to wake up and get you on the edge of your chair. Just fast forward through the first 10 minutes and then enjoy.",1415836800,,393,3.9873417721518987

He collects instruments of torture in his ""enhanced interrogation"" chamber. Can June and Martin figure out what's going on before Manetta and his cronies hatch their nefarious plot? CHAMBER OF HORRORS is a well-made mystery / thriller from 1940. For his part, Mr. Banks is supremely wicked -complete w/ cape and pet monkey- especially when showing off his devilish collection. Ms. Palmer plays her role w/ guts and brains. She's not some mousey pushover! A wonderful movie for lovers of classic, Edgar Wallace-inspired suspense...",1414454400,,1314,4.950226244343892

7924827,4,B00004W5UV,"I'm pleased that Roan used the original opening British credits, The Door With Seven Locks, on this feature.  The American title is included as an extra, but it makes no sense to also include the British censor card as an extra instead of at the beginning of the feature.  I'm assuming they used the British print throughout, although the delay as the opening credits fade out to the feature makes me suspicious.  I do wish that more information would be included on DVD releases.",1269561600,,480,4.690476190476191
