6506349,5,B00LU32EZ0,My son and I watched and enjoyed it (he's 4.5). He keeps asking to see it again. We've now watched several times. The cats and Tommy (Ezra Colbert)  are great...too cute!,1426032000,,170,4.483870967741935

6506354,3,B00LU32EZ0,"I think the feline performances eclipsed the homo sapian performances many times over, especially with Mitten's awesome thesbianism. Some aspects of this film I found a little unrealistic, for instance, when the kittens were lost in the blizzard, their paws bounced on the ""snow"", they did not sink. Really? C'mon! That was totally fake-y! Also, Santa is allergic to almost everything.....how can he have so many food allergies and be chowing cookies all night long with impunity? Again, fake-y. And lastly, the neighbor, Marcus has been wearing the same glasses his whole life, now he's like 30, fake-y! But, it's a pretty decent flick...Meow!",1419465600,,644,5.201923076923077
6506355,3,B00LU32EZ0,"It was entertaining. A decent holiday movie worth the price, if you are a cat person.",1419379200,2,85,4.375

6506357,4,B00LU32EZ0,"This is either the worst Christmas movie ever made, or an amazing parody of terrible Christmas movies. I choose the latter!

What we have here is a concoction of nearly every trope of throwaway Christmas movies, thrown into blender, pureed to perfection, and served in glass with a side of winking wry humor. (I hope).

-Spoilers-
The on-screen events range from mildly affecting (the boys
and his home-made Christmas tree) to downright creepy (all the adults
and everything they do). The cats do talk, but their mouths move in
only one scene, which is fine by me. The rules of Santa's magic change
from one scene to the next, as the movie tries to cram everything magic
(sleighs,reindeer,bags, hats, snow-globes, etc., presents, cameras)
until the very last scene. It's truly a bizarre and interesting
combination.

What really sets the movie apart from the rest of the throw-away pack
are the existential questions it raises from what is off- screen. Where
are all the people? How did these two people end up in the same houses
they grew-up in 30 years later, yet their parents and siblings are no
where to be found? What did they do with them? Does seeing Santa when
you are 6 years old turn you into a complete psychopath? Apparently,
yes. Also, why everything is so clean?
-Spoilers-

The people involved were responsible for the technicals on many low- budget horror movies (including Sharknado 2 and Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark). In fact, you see their allegiances to the craft of film making at the end of the movie, where all the skilled labor and technical jobs get credit before anyone else.

My family watched it, we laughed at it, and now we promise to make this movie family tradition for years to come. Well worth 85 minutes of my life.",1419033600,2,1750,4.724590163934426
6506358,1,B00LU32EZ0,"One of the worst acted movies I've ever had the unfortunate experience of watching.  Santa is allergic to both cats and cookies, and proceeds to blow snot all over one of the main characters faces in one memorable scene.  This movie is absolutely not worth watching.  Please save yourselves and just go watch cat videos on Youtube.",1418947200,3,331,4.771929824561403
6506359,1,B00LU32EZ0,"This movie manages to make every character unlikeable, from the pathetic abusive mother to the stalker man-boy neighbor. Even Santa Claws veers between hapless and maniacal. We kept watching this trainwreck of a movie because my daughter wanted to know what happened. Don't do it. Don't watch it. Save yourselves.",1482019200,,313,5.28
6506360,5,B00LU32EZ0,Good for kids!,1480636800,,14,4.0
6506361,4,B00LU32EZ0,Over all a good movie. Some parts I didn't care for. Kitties should be kept inside it's safer. Could be a bit scary at times for littler ones.,1462320000,,142,4.107142857142857
6506362,1,B00LU32EZ0,Lol horrible movie. Couldn't let my niece watch it bc it talks about how Santa isn't real. But service and delivery were on time.,1459987200,,129,4.416666666666667
6506363,4,B00LU32EZ0,It better than I expected.,1453161600,,26,4.4
6506364,1,B00LU32EZ0,"Horrible acting...really awful. Kittens with grown up voices... over acting...flat delivery... just awful... for a four year old it is entertaining probably because it seem as though it's targeted toward a four year old intellect... or maybe because it was written and acted by people with a four year old intellect. Either way it was painfully to watch for me, an adult, which while my four year old enjoyed it.",1439942400,,412,4.9
6506365,5,B00LU32EZ0,I can't help but adore this movie. In fact one of the kitties is my very own Freyja.  She played the kitten at the beginning of the movie that crawled all over the very allergic Santa. I showed this movie to my second graders and they loved it and we're very excited that their teacher's cat was in the movie.,1439078400,4,309,4.15

8668104,1,B00LU32EZ0,"My daughter (3) wanted to watch this because it has cats (she loves dog/cat movies) and it was a Christmas movie and I do love my Christmas movies anytime ofit the year...but god....this movie was horrible. Thankfully she fell asleep and I didn't have to finish it watching it. The moms a b*tch...I mean come on....let your damn kid have a tree, who cares if Santa isn't real. Grinch! And the neighbor, boy....he was a weirdo!! Hopefully I don't have to watch it again.",1523059200,,469,4.595238095238095

8668109,5,B00LU32EZ0,This movie is hella tight. It's right up there with Goodfellas and Shawshank Redemption. Very relatable storyline. Insanely good acting as well.,1503532800,,144,5.590909090909091

8668112,5,B00LU32EZ0,"Absolutely adorable!  Kittens save Christmas!  Kudos to the filmmakers cause it isn't easy herding around three mischievous kittens, much less getting  a brilliant acting performance from them.  I loved the terrible snow storm scene and Christmas WAS Saved!  Hurray!  And nobody got sent to the pound.",1482710400,,301,5.434782608695652
