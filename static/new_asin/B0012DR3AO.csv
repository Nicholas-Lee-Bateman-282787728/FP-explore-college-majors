8245158,2,B0012DR3AO,"I was disappointed. I'm sure it probably gave the time of the DVD in the promo but I didn't notice, however, I don't think a 10 minute film was worth that price.",1463875200,,161,4.0625

8245162,3,B0012DR3AO,"Most of the TravelVideoStore videos I've seen come across as fairly low-budget productions, and this is another one.  The scenery of Ha Long Bay is beautiful, but this video felt like 11 minutes of pretty much the same thing.  Not bad, but I think it could have been a lot more interesting.  At least it's short.",1371686400,,312,4.535714285714286
