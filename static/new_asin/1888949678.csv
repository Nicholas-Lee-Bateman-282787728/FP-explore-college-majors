8633812,1,1888949678,"I only gave this one star because the website wouldn't accept it with no stars. Better than 50% of this DVD is shot underground where all you can see/hear is dark, grainy film, some lights and lots of light reflections along with a bunch of passengers talking loudly as if it was a party.  You cannot see any track or see or hear much of anything that relates to a subway ride.  Even the occasional express ride thru subway stations is poor video.
The two redeeming parts of this DVD are trips around the subway car yards but instead of the advertised cab ride, you get views exclusively from the rear of the train. And the overall narration of this video is very sub par.
If I had videod this tape I would not have had the audacity to put it on a DVD with my name and worse yet, sell it.
For the price Valhalla asks for this DVD, save your money.",1297209600,,847,4.190184049079755
