I now own this and it is better than I thought. It contains a recent Interview with RJD and guitarist Craig Goldy",1073865600,7,326,4.52542372881356
208138,4,5556000948,"This is a great Dio video, quite extraordinary really. The film wouldve been almost perfect if some things couldve been different. The laser show was extraordinary though I won't deny that. And i honestly enjoy this video as much as I enjoy the videos by maiden ect. but this shouldve been more organized. Like Vinny Appice one of the greatest drummers of all time, he did a fine job and went smoothly with the songs, but he didn't give it alot of effort the entire time he is just hitting the snare and isn't doing the same outstanding drumwork he usually does. At least not on alot of songs, and Jimmy Bain's bass needs to come up alot more. I mean you can hardly even hear it, like on heaven and hell that song is just full of bass most of the time and you can barely even hear it. And claudie schnell shouldve done more keyboard work on sacred heart, it was still good but it could have been better. As for Craig Goldy he was just quite extraordinary and replays the songs exactly the same way vivian campbell did, some even better. But they didn't play enough songs off sacred heart, they only played 3 live which were sacred heart, king of rock&roll,rock&roll children, and well you get to hear hungry for heaven with the credits but still wouldve been better to watch them play it. They shouldve also played just another day and fallen angels. And yes rock&roll children is an amzingly deep song, I don't know why anyone would think its ridiculous, its absolutely perfect. Its all in all a great video I think the first time you see it you will be amazed but after a few times you start noticing the flaws more, but yes it is a metal classic and is worth having.

208142,5,5556000948,"There's a reason why Ronnie was a legend in rock and this vid proves it . I was lucky enough to see him on the final Heaven and Hell tour and I almost think his vocals were probably the best I had heard . Basically , the guy lost none of his ""chops"" over the years . I think another review mentioned that the vid has the songs mixed up but that's just the way the concert was . Ronnie did that sort of thing quite a bit as a solo performer , like maybe do a medley of songs and then come back to the first song of the medley . His band here is awesome and some people speak bad of Craig Goldy but I thought he did a great job . I happened to see him when they did the tour for ""intermission"" on my birthday and I was front row center stage . The only thing I didn't like was they had flamethrowers in front of the stage and they were aimed a little too low . I had about half my hair burnt off after the first couple of times flames shot out so after that when the flames shot I would crouch down . Awesome night , I think I ate some blue dragon so that always makes concerts a little better !",1349654400,,1093,3.777292576419214

208144,5,5556000948,"This concert needs to LIVE FOREVER!! I have seen more than 200 concerts, including Dio 7 times, and this is by far the best concert ever. But I would like to see Pink Floyd live before betting any money on my statement. Dio is not even my favorite band, though he is in the top 20. It was a sad day when he died. I listened to all of his CD's and watched this video many times in his memory. I saw this concert live in Omaha, NE and have had to buy the VHS twice and the DVD twice due to wearing them out. In fact, the only reason I am writing this review now is because I am about to order another new DVD. I wish it would come out in Blu-Ray. This is the only concert that actually brought tears of joy to my eyes as it unfolded in front of me. Buy it and play it at max volume, then imagine being in the audience. I would suggest that you do it without alcohol or drugs. You won't want to miss any of it. The only bad thing about the video is it cuts out a lot of the actual concert. The live drum solo was incredible and the laser lights seemed to never stop. It was a very sad day when Ronnie James Dio died.",1326499200,,1113,3.8434782608695652
208145,5,5556000948,"I saw this tour in 1985. I saw it at The Sports Arena in Toledo Ohio. This is an amazing DVD! It is a bit grainy, since it's from the mid 80's. The sound quality is totally awesome and clear. I would love to see it cleaned up and remastered and released on Blu-ray.
  Ronnie's voice is amazing and soars powerfully and clear, as always. The band is absolutely great and crystal clear, what an excellent performance by all! Ronnie James Dio was one of the greatest and most respected performers ever. He loved his fans and performing for them. His fans loved him and his style and grace. A true class act, was Ronnie and it shines through in this performance.
  The show features ""Dean"" The Dragon, standing 20 feet tall. He roars ever so loudly and shoot lasers, billows smoke and fire, amazing to see live and on this DVD! Dean meets his match when Ronnie wields a sword and slays him. Ronnie pulls at Dean's torso, opening him up and revealing his laser generated heart.  A crystal ball of what I believe was 6 feet across, descends from above; in a slightly eerie fashion. Ronnie's face appears there, along with holograms, lasers,the wizard and finally ""The Sacred Heart.""The stage set is a midi eval castle with Vinny Appice,(the drummer) high atop. The high tech sound equipment topped a reported 25 tons! There are also 2 warriors that fire lasers at one another and explode into flash pots and clouds of smoke, very cool.
  I recall an interview on the DVD where Ronnie says, he'd like to do this show again. It saddens me to think what it would've been, since we lost Ronnie on May 16th 2010. They did the entire Holy Diver album live. Sacred Heart would've been the ultimate show on Blu ray! It is also known that on the last night of this tour and the last song, Dean collapsed and landed on the drum set. I'd have to guess that he was exhausted after a two year reign as The Greatest Show on Earth. This tour won that award for the 2 years it was assembled.
  Over all, this production receives a Well Deserved A+++, as it is Supremacy at it's finest. It is an instant, timeless classic and is like no other. If your looking for the Ultimate in a very high production rock concert, then by all means-buy this DVD. It's an award winning performance by:Ronnie James (Padavona) Dio(R.I.P. We All Love and miss you-dearly),Vinny Appiice, Jimmy Bain,Craig Goldy, Claude Schnell, the warriors and Dean The Dragon. The true definition of Excellence, IS DIO!!!
  The MAN may be gone, the LEGEND lives.

208146,4,5556000948,"Here it is a few days past the one year mark since Ronnie had to leave us, and I just watched this dvd and had a strong desire to post my feelings about this land mark, award-winning tour by a giant of a singer and human being. Sometime back in 1987 I had learned from a drummer co-worker friend that guitar-driven ""heavy metal"" had returned. Having been a big fan of Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Grand Funk, Alice Cooper, and all the fantastic hard rock of the 70's I was thrilled to know that hard rock fuelled by Marshall amps and electric guitars was here again. I had turned my back on the rock oriented radio of the late 70's because all had turned to disco and very bad pop, and so I had no knowledge of the LA-based ""metal"" scene that was blossoming, heralding the advent of a new breed of artists that were turning rock fans upside down and pissing parents off all the way to Washington D.C. I had just had a falling out with Jesus and the conservative seminary I had attended for two years and was in a very musically ""lost"" state. I mention the religion aspect because at that crucial point in my life I was adrift in a sea of banality like I'd never known existed. Then one day, my rebellious self entered a store in Nashville, TN  called The Great Escape, and there, perusing the comic books, collectible items of various sorts, and vinyl lp's I saw it... Black Sabbath's ""Live Evil"", a beautiful double-gatefold jacket sporting a collage of images that depicted classic Sabbath songs. I knew Ozzy had left Sabbath and ""that singer from Rainbow"" had taken his place. Prior to this, obviously Blackmore had left Purple, Alice had gone Broadway and New Wave (!), Skynyrd went belly up, John Bonham and Bon Scott had died so you see why some of us thought hard rock was dying out. But then there I was in Nashville in '87 at a crossroads in my own life and needing something of substance to grab hold to. I went home with that double lp and from the moment the E5150 intro played and Ronnie James Dio launched into the first song, I became a Dio fan for life. TWENTY FOUR YEARS later I sit at my pc after having watched my dvd of ""Dio - The Sacred Heart"" one year after Ronnie's passing and all I can manage is a humble ""Wow"". Of course I back-tracked and discovered the wonder of his three albums with Rainbow, all the wondrous Black Sabbath material, and his own band ""Dio"", which figured heavily in the definition of this genre named ""Heavy Metal"".
  This dvd is important because it documents the band Dio's peak; original guitarist Vivian Campbell had recorded ""Sacred Heart"" with the band but had decided to leave the group and not do the tour, hence Craig Goldie's introduction as the new Dio guitar player. This is Ronnie, young, vibrant, exuberant, and in love with his audience, as he was always. Of course, given the time frame, the material is inclusive of Rainbow, Black Sabbath, and of course Dio's own Holy Diver and The Last In Line, and the, then, brand new Sacred Heart lp's with a song from the ""Intermission"" EP. He loves life and loves his job, which was evidently his calling. The only criticism I have for the dvd is the fact that, for whatever reason, Craig Goldie's fantastic guitar playing is so far in the background of the mix as to dilute the power of the music, which is bearable, but very annoying. He's a blazer on axe.
  Get this while you can. It's getting expensive, as it is obviously out-of-print, but know that this is a huge part of the legend that is Ronnie James Dio. A moment in time in our lives that we may never retrieve, only remember. Ronnie set me free, with his lyrics of liberation from the constraints of conventional religion, something I wish he could've known, but I'm sure the same could be said of legions of his fans. This life is crazy and unpredictable, but remember: ""WE may never, never, never come home, but the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime"". Amen.",1305849600,,3932,4.455555555555556

208153,4,5556000948,"I missed the Sacred Heart show at the Cow Palace in '85(San Francisco) but remember a live recording on the local rock station w/ VIVIAN CAMPBELL which included Like the Beat of a Heart, Last in Line/Holy Diver, and Don't Talk to Strangers which was magical. Why Dio didn't release a video with Vivian is beyond me. Nothing against Craig but the original lineup which was a wondrous thing should have been on this video(now DVD) Dio prancing around with a sword slaying the dragon with lasers coming out of the eyes is downright hilarious nowadays but that Lord of the Rings style cheese was the bomb back then. For the kids I would recommend the Last in Line video from the Spectrum if it's available on DVD. Old middle aged metalheads I'll see you at HEAVEN AND HELL '07! How old is Dio now, 70?! And he'll be on stage pointing the devil horns at you! LOL!!! ON AND ON, ON AND ON! HEAVEN AND HELL! YEAH!!",1174089600,3,906,4.398809523809524

The most metal thing I have ever witnessed, I envy anyone who saw this in the flesh!!! Dio sounds as good today as he did then...so metal!!! Just a plain ol' good time. Show this to your non-metal friends and they won't believe what they've been missing!  Satan bless Dio, he is the real deal, from Rainbow to Sabbath, he has done no wrong, and this dvd is proof of that.

208157,3,5556000948,"I don't know why Dio always does this at concerts.  Does he not ever think that fans might want to hear a live version of a song in its entirety?  Holy Diver and Rock'n Roll children are ruined because they are not played through in their entirety, but rather, they are placed into a ""medly"" with other songs.  What a shame.  I actually think Craig Goldie sounds way better on this DVD than he does on the ""Intermission"" CD, which was lacking in guitar tone.  Intermission was another example of fragmented versions of songs.  A message to Dio and management:  release a live DVD or CD with all the best live versions of Rainbow in the Dark, Holy Diver, Egypt the Chains are On, Evil Eyes, Caught in the Middle etc.  Yes, Caught in the Middle is one of the best.  Surely it must have been played live at some point?  Skip all the Black Sabbath covers that we've now heard about a billion times.  Maybe re-release and remaster some of the stuff with Vivian Campbell, as well.  Don't the fans deserve it?  It could be a win-win situation.",1108598400,8,1036,4.417989417989418
208158,4,5556000948,"Get out your capes and scepters! The swagger-stick wielding god of rock, Ronaldus Deus Maximus, pelts fans at the Philadelphia Spectrum with fire and ice in this excellent concert video, originally taped in 1986.

Watch this DVD, and you will know for the first time, whether we are, indeed, evil or divine. There's one problem with this video, though: Dio doesn't belt out the vocals with the same intensity and lungpower that he does on the studio records.

That said, he more than makes up for it with showmanship, a great (for its time) laser light show and a set conducive for him, of course, to Slay the Dragon. It sort of has the same theme as ""Lord of the Rings,"" only this has actual entertainment.

For Dio doth deliver on songs such as ""Rainbow in the Dark,"" ""Sacred Heart,"" ""Rock and Roll Children"" and ""The Last In Line."" Not enough Sabbath representation. ""Heaven and Hell"" always bringeth down the house, but I'd wished that he had included ""The Mob Rules,"" ""Sign of the Southern Cross"" and ""Children of the Sea"" (he blew an excellent opportunity to enact one of his patented amalgam tunes, which he could have called ""Rock and Roll Children of the Sea.""

Nonetheless, lords and ladies faire, this is still Dio. Dios. Deus. Mein Gott in Himmel.

There is only one. And he's on this disc.",1105228800,4,1302,4.643478260869565
208159,2,5556000948,"This DVD starts off good enough, with a great version of King of Rock and Roll, but then it just gets too synthesizer heavy. The rare A Special from the Spetrum video blows this away in terms of heaviness and song selection. Rainbow in the Dark is good as always but where is We Rock and The Mob Rules? Dio's 2003 Evil or Divine DVD is way better than this. The biggest reason to get this would be for the stage show which Dio won an award for. Most bands don't have cool stage shows like this any more. Why wasn't the concert footage of Hungry for Heaven shown rather than the song just being played during the end credits? Look for the import We Rock DVD which includes half of the Special from the Spectrum show and part of another concert from 1983, both with Vivian Campbell on guitar.",1101340800,4,790,4.273333333333333
208160,5,5556000948,"Well, I've seen Ronnie James Dio perform live six (6) times including on Sabbath's 'Heaven & Hell' trek. I've even met him three times and the second time he actually remember me, by name. The 'Sacred Heart' tour was, no doubt an awesome event, but for some reason, I was more blown away by his 'Last In Line' tour. Don't get me wrong, 'Sacred Heart' is great. Noticed on this DVD that guitarist Craig Goldie had replaced Vivian Campbell (I had sort of forgot about that) but nonetheless, Goldie fills in quite well. I'm unlikely to miss Vinny Appice on the drums. The sound and picture are simply of fantastic quality. All this metal magic, crystal ball action, dragons and swords never left my memory as I saw Dio the year BEFORE this DVD was filmed. Dug pretty much every tune, like the scorching opener ""King Of Rock And Roll"", ""Holy Diver"", ""Rock & Roll Children"", ""Man Of The Silver Mountain"", ""Rainbow In The Dark"" and ""Hungry For Heaven"". Very visual. Much worthy of repeated plays. A must-have for all fans of Dio and the metal genre.",1099612800,3,1043,4.5828877005347595

The lighting effects and stage setup is really good, though I think he had better stages during other tours, but hey I guess the dragon gives this concert the more points.
There are some amazing solos by Craig Goldy, and the lighting effects done when Dio does the vocal solo for Heaven and Hell were spellbinding.
The version of Rock N Roll Children was really good, and if you weren't too happy with the sorta pop sound it had on the studio album the you'll probably like this version, especially the intro. It was also good to see Time To Burn on the concert as it is a great song and this'll be the only time you'll probably see it live unless he plays it again on an upcoming tour, but I doubt it.",1088726400,,927,4.364161849710983

The band also stood out, including Craig Goldie, who (in his words) went from being a fan to playing with one of the most forceful singers in rock.  He was a small man, but with a big voice.  He was about the audience and the music.  He rocked.  A true loss, upon his death, to metal.  The ""Rainbow"" went black that day.  Rest in Peace Ronnie.",1371081600,,746,4.56390977443609
