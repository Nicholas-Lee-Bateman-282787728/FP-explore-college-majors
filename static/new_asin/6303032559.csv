7835646,2,6303032559,"Thrillers are probably second to comedies as the hardest genres to do well. All the technique at the hands of a director comes to naught if the  screenplay is as ridiculous as the one Ben Lewin co-wrote here. The premise  is an investigation into the death of a woman that occured in the past, a  theme sabotaged by having someone comment that Polish philosophers believe  that returning to the past is ""an exercise in futility"". The  idea might have worked if it had concentrated on the 4 Rashomon-style  interpretations, and not included a parallel story, where the daughter who  is trying to find out the truth behind her mother's demise, is in danger  for doing so. Lewin pours on the stylistics, with a marvellous subjective  tracking shot of a run down a pier, candle-lit rooms, people living with  bare windows, anonymous phone calls, and an overbearing score by Paul  Gabrowsky which features a tango. There is even a shower attack which is  like a parody of the one from Psycho. Some of the dialogue is impossibly  arch. When the daughter sees a portrait of her identical mother at an  exhibition at the Ephemera Art Gallery (ugh!), her companion asks the  clearly disturbed daughter if something is wrong! Thank goodness Lewin had  the sense to cast the always watchable Judy Davis. Unlike her contemporary,  Mel Gibson, Davis has returned sporadically to her native Australia after  achieving international success, and it's easy to see what attracted her  this time. She plays a double role, reminiscent of Frances Farmer's  opportunity in Come and Get It. As the daughter, Nina, she is a high-flying  tax fraud prosecutor, and it is these skills that enable her access to  information to pursue her search. Nina is given an expensive wardrobe,  which Davis looks very beautiful in, in opposition to the poor styling of  her mother. The character of Georgia is in fact a cypher, which undermines  the allure she is supposed to have. She barely speaks and seems to only  exist to take photographs, and die. The photographs themselves are quite  striking, especially the self-portrait with Davis as a blonde. Davis'  scenes with Julia Blake as a friend of Georgia are probably the best part  of the film. Lewin gives Davis plenty of space to react and her pain is  real, though he does make her look silly when she is being chased. The  final explaination for the death is negligible, and the end is particularly  bad, though ironically it does say something about why Davis would return  to Hollywood.",966124800,6,2512,4.849056603773585
