8326199,5,B0018KZ4H0,"A great revenge flick with many exciting twist and turns. It is a hilarious black comedy that is well written and directed. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves sharp dialogue and suspense. This indie film is a true showcase of an extremely talented director. Although this is Sean Tracy's first film, he is a filmmaker to watch out for. He maybe the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese.",1276214400,,400,4.728571428571429

I saw the debut of this film at a festival in New York. The theatre was mobbed, and people loved it. It is very much like early Quentin Tarrantino.",1211587200,,299,7.542857142857143
