8678543,5,B00NJ3AJOM,"Visually stunning!  Very relaxing!  Mesmerizing photography.  The time lapsed photography of the oceans is nothing less than amazing.  It truly captures what the human eye can not see with direct observation of ocean waves. There are two segments on this DVD, clouds and oceans.  Both end with a magnificent star scape.  This DVD is well worth the money.  Great buy for those in need of a mini getaway, or de-stressor!",1447286400,6,418,4.885714285714286
