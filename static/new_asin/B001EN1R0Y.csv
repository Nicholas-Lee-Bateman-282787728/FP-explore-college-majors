3556297,5,B001EN1R0Y,"I was at the concert in person, and it was an awesome performance.  I didn't see him in the Carlsbad Caverns but it was totally awesome on the video.",1231632000,,149,4.137931034482759
3556298,5,B001EN1R0Y,"I have been waiting 2 years for this release.  I was born and raised in Carlsbad ""City on the Pecos"".  My brother had been watching the Carlsbad Current Argus for this release so as to inform me of the release date so that I could purchase it.  My brother passed away in January of 2008 and regreatfully did not get to see this release.  I am hoping he is watching from up above as I play this beautiful DVD for him.  I just placed my order for 4 of them.  I will pass 3 to my children.  Thank you for finally releasing ""Christmas on the Pecos"".  For those of you that have never been to Carlsbad, the Caverns or have seen Chirstmas on the Pecos River, you will LOVE this DVD and will want to make plans to visit Carlsbad during the Christmas season to ride down the Pecos and see the most beautiful site you will ever witness.",1231200000,2,827,4.1572327044025155
3556299,5,B001EN1R0Y,"Randy Travis has done it again. Christmas on the Pecos is a winner! He is warm and talented singer and this DVD is a must-have for Christmas. It has both fun Christmas music and holy music that honors the Birth of Christ. His rich voice is such a pleasure to listen to, and the New Mexico setting adds a unique and enjoyable flavor that sets this one apart from other Christmas shows. You don't have to be a country music fan to enjoy this!",1229904000,2,440,4.25

3556301,5,B001EN1R0Y,"To whom it may concern,

I enjoyed this DVD very much.  I think that other customers would like it, too.  Randy has an awsome voice and sings a song with reverence and emotion.  There is no one better.  His interaction with the audience and his humbleness shines through.  The Festival of lights on the Pecos River and the shots from The Carlsbad Caverns is wonderful and the Choir that sang there was great.  Everyone should have this in their collection if they are a Country Music FAN.  Especially a Randy Travis fan.

Thank you ----Connie",1229126400,8,542,4.621052631578947
3556302,5,B001EN1R0Y,I was at this concert as it was filmed except for the two songs performed down in the Carlsbad Caverns.  It was a great time.  But the two songs performed in the Caverns are absolutely awesome!  It gives you goosebumps to hear it.  Well worth the price!!,1229040000,7,254,4.340425531914893

3556304,5,B001EN1R0Y,"First of all, let me just say I have not actually seen this DVD.  However I myself and my family were present for this amazing concert.  I plan on purchasing it ASAP!

Randy Travis is an amazing performer and very personable.  This was one of my favorite concert going experiences and I have been to many many concerts.

This concert was actually filmed two years ago.  It has just taken this long to get it released.  If you are thinking it is a concert of music from his latest Christmas CD, there were not very many songs from that actually done at this concert.

I will definitely be purchasing it when it comes out!",1225584000,9,620,4.37719298245614

8298885,5,B001EN1R0Y,"As  Randy always does he puts ""class"" in everything he offers to his fans. This DVD is no exception .I have purchased this Christmas offering from Randy and have enjoyed it greatly. This is a DVD that can be enjoyed by every age and at anytime of the year.

I loved the scenery of the ""River Of Lights"", and the Carlsbad Caverns were stunning. Randy's voice with the back up harmony of the choir singing ""Rock Of Ages"" and ""Silent Night""  in those Caverns is goose bump
making performances. Absolutely AWESOME! Randy is a great talent. I loved his reading of ""The Christmas Story"". It's easy to see why he is sought for movies with that natural story telling ability.

I've always loved Randy's version of Willie Nelson's ""Pretty Paper"". I was glad to see that was among his song selections.

As another has said, I wish it could have been a little bit longer. With a few more songs. But its well worth the price and the viewing!

 All should include this  DVD in their entertainment collection. Be they country music fans or not. It will warm your heart.",1236384000,4,1055,4.515789473684211
