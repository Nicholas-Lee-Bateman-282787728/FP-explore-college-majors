We all know that the Soviets were our allies during World War II but within a few y ears became our arch enemy during the Cold War. But, few people ever talk about what happened to make that so. This DVD, on the other hand, takes the time to explain how it was the existence of the Atom bomb that changed the world landscape and created out of thin air the cold war that almost caused the end of hte human rance. It's a great study in how technolgy can cause unintended consequences.",1148256000,,582,4.252252252252252
