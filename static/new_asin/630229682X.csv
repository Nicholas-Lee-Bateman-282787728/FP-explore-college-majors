7823707,5,630229682X,"Extremely historically accurate, with in depth detail of events and people that have written as eyewitness accounts. Anyone wanting to know anything about Noah's Ark it's all inclusive. This film is legendary in proving Noah's Ark is located on Mount Arat. I have not seen such a detailed account of events. Many newer films have used bits and pieces of this film in brief. A Biblical foundation is explained in greater detail supporting the finding from Genesis of the Arks location on Mount Arat in Turkey. Be amazed as this film will make you stop and think and consider many unanswered questions clearly explained. Check it out!",1445299200,,632,4.91588785046729

7823709,5,630229682X,"I saw this movie in the theater back in 1976 and have been looking for it online after the internet became popular; couldn't find it.  In a conversation with my daughter last month, I brought the topic up in passing; she found the DVD on your website, and I jumped right on the chance to purchase it.  Thank you so much for its safe arrival and the enjoyment I remembered when watching it the first time.",1410825600,,404,4.302631578947368

Although it was not the one I expected, it is still good and arrived promptly and in good shape.",1358812800,,143,4.142857142857143
7823711,4,630229682X,"This documentary film was released in 1977. Since than, a lot has changed in the field of Ark research. However, the film covers the history of Ark research up until 1976 and this is the best aspect of the film. Some of the conclusions reached are a bit premature as they lack concrete evidence. For example, when the narrator states,
""Since we have proven that the Bible is an accurate account of history,..."" without
really providing the evidence is the films weakest point.
I still recommend the film as it provides a lot of background information on the Ark itself.",1324944000,,569,4.7
7823712,5,630229682X,"""altough i first saw this movie in 1977, i remember this being a film which not only made you feel like you had actually been there when the great flood happened, these actors(& narrator, brad crandall) genuinely made this movie come to life! i can only say, for the person who claimed this movie helped to perpetuate a ""myth"", HE is truly the one who needs ""help""; today, as in 1977, i am still thankful to sunn-classic pictures, for this wonderful movie!",1270684800,12,456,4.573170731707317
7823713,1,630229682X,"In 1977, a documentary called ""In Search of Noah's Ark"" aired on numerous television stations, claiming that the Ark had been found on Mt. Ararat. This documentary was based on a book of the same title by David W. Balsiger, and continues to be taken seriously by some in the Ark-search community, though is widely regarded as another hoax. Balsiger also co-authored ""Ancient Secrets of the Bible"" but that book also sensationalized its subject matter. Both of these books pushes the facts to one side -- basically trying to prove to the reader that ""everything about the Bible is true"" so therefore, any religion that says it is based purley on the Bible is also true. There are many inaccuracies, and certain items seem to be just ""assumed"" as fact instead of actually backed by proven statistics or certified professionals.

Reguardless of being well-know as a hoax, even today, it reassured the previous assumptions of the Ark being on Mt. Ararat, and people still look for it on a yearly basis. There are MUCH better documentaries out there on the subject, and they're even certified by well-respected institutions. Many people would love to see ""hard"" evidence of the Ark, because if it IS true, then what else in the Bible could be proven real? Stay away from programs that say the Ark is 100% real upfront, for they usually can't show you any actual evidence or live witnesses. Look elsewere.

This production is not to be confused with an episode from the third season of ""In Search Of... Noah's Flood"" (1979) narrated by Leonard Nimoy.",1154563200,5,1544,4.8226415094339625
7823714,5,630229682X,"This video is great because the information it provides is so important and so hard to find. This video documents any noteworthy research done to find or prove that the Ark of Noah exists on Mt. Ararat. It is a serious documentary loaded with information.  The person who wrote that it is a religious cult movie needs treatment. With the same logic, one could call the Old Testament religious cult nonsense (and he basically said that!), and any religions that follow afterwards..Judaism, Christianity, Islam... It is an objective look at historical scientific research which has been serious enough to have been kept in government files.  If you're looking for an example, wood was found on barren Mt. Ararat and was taken to a lab to be scientifically analyzed. The conclusion was that a human had worked on the piece of wood and that this wood-type had originated from the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, exactly where it is supposed to had come from.  Along with all the other research described in the video, dating back centuries, if the viewer is a bit intellectual with a scientific mind, one should be marvelled.  Compared to the other videos, DVDs, or even books on the subject, this is a superior choice.",1061251200,19,1229,4.838095238095238
7823715,1,630229682X,"This is it -- the famous creationist movie, full of sophistry, misinformation, logical fallacies, and grainy, out-of-focus photography.  It was a minor hit, too.  It's a classic for the crazy re-enactments and bad, BAD science within.  Viva la ""Proof by Blatant Assertion""!
It might not be the easiest video to find (try the Video Oyster), but if you can track it down, pair it with PLAN 9 or REEFER MADNESS, and whip out some Kool-Aid and fluffernutters, you've a choice camp party.",997660800,6,483,4.865853658536586
