4250637,4,B0042FDCNQ,"Curiosity got the better of me; I just had to see a horror movie about a killer cookie.  In this case, a double feature!
As a fan of the Puppet Master series, I pretty much knew what to expect and in that regard, I wasn't disappointed.  I will say I liked the second movie better than the first and as I was watching it, I ordered the third movie in this series.  My only complaint about the first movie is that it felt like a rough draft.  They really didn't have the right balance of horror to humor worked out.  The second feature though, got it perfectly; it's zany and sly and not a little nuts.  I can't wait to see the third installment.",1339459200,3,644,4.153225806451613
4250638,3,B0042FDCNQ,IT WAS OKAY BUT NOT AS GOOD AS OLD THRIILERS WHICH WERE NINETY MINUTES LONG.IT WAS FUNNY AND SCARY THOUGH.,1329004800,,106,4.35
4250639,3,B0042FDCNQ,"I knew what I was getting into ordering this movie, and that's why I ordered it. The movie is terrible - campy, cheap and hilarious. The idea of Gary Busey turning into a gun wielding cookie tells you everything you need to know about it.
The second one is nothing but salacious drivel. It lost all the campy goodness of the first one and didn't have the solid base of Gary Busey's voice to save it. I turned it off.",1328227200,,416,4.2125
4250640,5,B0042FDCNQ,awesome products ! they arrived shortly after ordering. Just in time for christmas. i will definatly be ordering more movies !,1326240000,,126,5.0476190476190474
4250641,5,B0042FDCNQ,"Maybe it's just the fact that I love B horror films, but this one's amazing. Gary Busey is incredible in his role, and when I thought it couldn't get any better, I watched the second movie. Tiny toys coming to life and crucifying the Gingerdead Man, I was in bliss!",1314230400,3,265,4.32
4250642,4,B0042FDCNQ,"I wasn't a big fan of Gingerdead Man. With the exception of Gary Busey's presence, I didn't think it was that exciting. However, Gingerdead Man 2 is a definite improvement, and is enough to make this double feature worth buying if you like cheesy b-movies. And I do.",1297209600,8,266,4.5625

8413640,1,B0042FDCNQ,I only bought these because I had the 3rd installment (on a collection of 20 horror films) and didn't want to watch it before I'd seen the first 2.  Total junk.  I'll never watch any of them again.,1387584000,,197,4.157894736842105
8413641,3,B0042FDCNQ,"This was tossed into my B-rate horror collection.  They are definitely the so-bad-its-funny type of flick, but at times the movie just got slow and boring.",1364601600,,155,4.961538461538462
8413642,5,B0042FDCNQ,this was so fantastic.  if you like really bad horror...like its so bad its good...you will love this! don't be expecting an academy award winning performance. just expect awesome rediculousness,1359849600,,194,5.466666666666667
