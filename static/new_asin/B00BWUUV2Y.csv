8574891,4,B00BWUUV2Y,"""J'enrage De Son Absence"" (2012 release from France; English title: ""Maddened By His Absence""; 98 min.) brings the story of Jacques (played by William Hurt), returning to France after 8 years in the US to bury his father and renewing contact with Mado (played by Alexandra Lamy), the woman he left behind when their 4 year old son Matthieu died 8 years ago. Jacques is still not over that, and is eager to strike up a friendship with Mado's 7 year old son Paul from Mado subsequent relationship with Stephane. What starts out as touching becomes a bit creepier as the story moves along, as it is clear that Jacques is becoming obsessed with Paul. To tell you much more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first of all, the performance of William Hurt is remarkable, including the fact that he speaks French more or less fluently in the entire movie (albeit with an American accent, of which Paul makes a joke or two). Second, Alexandra Lamy is equally intriguing, and looking fantastic it might be added. Third, writer-director Sandrine Bonnaire does a good job keeping us guessing as to how the plot will play out, as this story could've gone in many different directions. That said, I was about to give the movie 4 stars, but then the ending of the movie came entirely abrupt and frankly was unsatisfactory, which is unfortunate.

This movie showed up for one night only at a single theater in all of South Florida. I was rather curious and went ahead to see it. Imagine my surprise to see how well attended the screening actually was. I suppose it shows once again that there is a healthy demand for quality programming. If you are in the mood for a foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, I suggest you give this a chance. No, it's not the type of movie that you will walk away from thinking ""that was a bloody good time"", but then again you didn't really expect that going in. ""J'enrage De Son Absence"" is worth checking out, be it in the theather or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1390521600,,2093,4.5638297872340425
