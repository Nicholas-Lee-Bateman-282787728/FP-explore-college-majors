8221419,1,B000W6XCXO,"The second disc does NOT work: It is NOT recognized by my dvd player ( ""Supported disc not available"" on my Imac). But it's not a problem with my computer, because the first disc does play without problems.
The same thing happened with A Sound Relief.

I cannot get a replacement nor a refund because I can't return the item: I live in another country (Colombia).
I wish there could be another solution for us, the international customers. I hate the idea of buying again the same product, just to get a working second bloody disc, or even worst, the same faulty disc.

I am a huge fan of The Gathering, and for a very very long time I've been wanting so bad this double DVD, it hurts to finally get only the half...",1453420800,,716,4.335820895522388

8221421,5,B000W6XCXO,"This is an essential purchase for fans of The Gathering. It's a record of Anneke's final tour with the band and is the next best thing if you never had the chance to see them live (which I was lucky to do twice). What comes across, apart from the great renditions of their songs, is Anneke's total approachability and lack of pretension on stage - and, of course, that voice. This is a band going about their business with a real appreciation of their fans. The song selection covers just about all their albums from Mandylion through Home. The companion DVD, A Sound Relief, is an excellent compliment to this and focuses more on their slower compositions.

8221422,4,B000W6XCXO,"I give it 4 stars cause I like The Gathering, mostly there faster paced songs. Out of 19 tracks performed in this DVD, I only like 8 of them. Of course this DVD is a must have for any The Gathering fan or female-fronted fans, as the beautiful, Anneke Van Giersbergen, is no longer with the band. The songs I like that were performed: Shortest Day, Liberty Bell, Probably Built In The Fifties, Monsters, Leaves, Strange Machines, Adrenaline, and Third Chance. The songs I wished they performed: Confusion, Kevin's Telescope, Nighttime Birds, Shot To Pieces, You Learn About It, In Power We Trust, When The Sun Hits, and Solace. Other than that, I still enjoy watching Anneke perform as it is her last DVD with The Gathering. the 2nd disc of this DVD is good, an hour documentary of the band working on ""Home"" album in an abandoned church. I was really fascinated to see Anneke in this documentary, as this is the first for me to see her outside of a concert or not performing. Watching how close she is with the rest of her band mates, you would never figured she would leave shortly after. So as far as the song selections, this is still a good DVD.",1337731200,,1149,4.476190476190476
8221423,5,B000W6XCXO,"As both a fan of The Gathering and live music, this is the ultimate dvd/cd.
The Gathering is one of the best live bands I have seen and this is one of the better performances of them I can remember. Of course a lot of the ambience you can feel when you are actually there is missing because it can never be translated onto a dvd/cd but you can still see and feel it must have been amazing to be there.
My absolute favorite is the title track, A Noise Severe. It is so powerfull when played live, it is absolutly moving me to tears every time. But songs like Travel and In Motion are also very good. There are no bad songs on this dvd/cd!

Still amazing this great band is so little known but if you are not afraid of taking a chance, grabbed this fabulous performance! I guarantee you will be blown away by Anneke's voice and the enthousism of the band.",1241136000,5,853,4.16969696969697
8221424,5,B000W6XCXO,"As far as music DVDs go this is probably one of my favourites. 2005's 'A Sound Relief' was excellent, but what I wanted was something more epic and energetic, and this is what is delivered in 'A Noise Severe.' In this DVD, The Gathering play some of their faster paced new material, but also revisit titles from their earlier doom days, going as far back as tracks from Mandylion including 'Leaves' and 'Eleanor.'

It's a real pleasure to see such an amazing band at their most mature and best still paying homage to their earlier classics. Watching this and bearing in mind that it was Anneke's final tour with The Gathering makes it even more special.",1207526400,11,653,4.629310344827586
8221425,4,B000W6XCXO,"Last gig in Chile, last recording sessions, last mixing, last mastering, last album presentation The Gathering wrotte more than a decade with Anneke on vocals and at this time to be honest it looks like its the end of the road for them, its true the band existed before Anneke and its also true they emerged with a frontman instead of a woman and even is true that their music style was extreme death metal but Anneke presence was so remarkable not only for this band but for the alternative rock worldwide, that as it was a benefit for them to have her it will be a damage for this group now they loose her, this is not the case of many other bands that change their vocalist and the band keeps on working and selling and having fans, It needs someone very special to keep being the same.

This gig in Chile in front of an audience of 4,000 persons is more than spectacular, this is perhaps the highest point in The Gathering career and its important to remark they didn't repeated the same tracklisting played for ""A sound relief"" this is so cool because we can have an idea of how they play as many tracks as we can, lights, stage , everything is full of light and color and emotion.

Disc 2 shows a short film as a documentary of the recording process for ""Home"" from the arrangments to have a proper setup in a Chruch and then mastering in another studio, maybe is my imagination but Anneke doesnt seem to be very entusiastic , maybe she already had in mind her departure.

A Noise Severe its the final document The Gathering has left along with their other albums, this is sad but things have to come to an end
