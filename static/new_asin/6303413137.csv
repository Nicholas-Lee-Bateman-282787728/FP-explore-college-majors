SUPERBRAWL 5

Spoilers

1. ALEX WRIGHT VS PAUL ROMA-good opening match between these two here. Back and forth battle that sees Mr. Wonderful come out to the ring. His appearance also causes his friend Roma the match with Wright getting the win with a roll up.

2. JIM DUGGAN VS BUNKHOUSE BUCK-this was a pretty good brawl between these two. Both men get time to dominate taking turns on offense. It eventually goes to Duggan after taking out Rob Parker and hitting his three point stance. After the match Meng takes Duggans head off which leads to their match and Uncensored later.

3. KEVIN SULLIVAN VS DAVE SULLIVAN-decent match between the two brothers but it is basically Kevin controlling the match, he of course ends up winning it.

4.[TAG TITLE]HARLEM HEAT VS THE NASTY BOYS-this was a really good match as both teams look good. Nice back and forth with Sherri getting involved throughout as usual. Harlem Heat retains the belts after winning by a DQ after the Nasties thought they won. Possibly the best match on the card.

5. DUSTIN RHODES VS THE BLACKTOP BULLY-this match seems to get a lot of hate but I think it is a good enough match. Both men trade momentum in this one with Parker getting involved like he normally does. After Dustin gets rid of him or so he thinks Parker holds his leg as he tries to suplex Bully, Bully gets the pin.

6. RANDY SAVAGE & STING VS BIG BUBBAD ROGERS & AVALANCHE-the match I was most looking forward to back then as this was Macho Mans first WCW PPV. This match was a really fun one and the fans were really into it. Savage and Sting of course take home the win but Savage really shined here especially during the Flair segments as he was in the crowd, front row, and when he Macho was slapping Avalanche.

7.[WCW TITLE]HULK HOGAN VS VADER-this is an entertaining match especially for a Hogan match. Although I don't think there should have been those moments where he dominated Vader, should have been Vader as a beast the whole time. But tell me why Hogan could use a steel chair on Vader multiple times and not get DQd but when Flair gets involved Hogan wins by DQ. The ending ruined it of course although I loved seeing Savage again.

Over all a better event then some will say but a Hogan ending like one would expect.",1464912000,,2273,4.4842615012106535

7845853,2,6303413137,The Alex Wright-Paul Roma match was terrible which was made even worse by Roma's behavior. The Bunkhouse Buck-Jim Duggan match was a boring dud. The Kevin Sullivan-Evad Sullivan match was truly awful stuff and almost as bad as their Halloween Havoc bout. The World tag team title match between Harlem Heat & The Nasty Boys was mediocre. The Blacktop Bully-Dustin Rhodes match was horrendous. The tag team match between the team of Avalanche & Big Bubba Rogers against the team of Randy Savage & Sting was also mediocre. The World title match between Hulk Hogan & Vader was fine until the goofy finish. I give this PPV a 3 out of 10.,1363132800,,632,4.651785714285714
7845854,2,6303413137,"THIS IS THE AVERAGE WCW PAY-PER-VIEW. FULL OF POINTLESS UNDERCARD MATCHES AND LACED WITH A CORNY MAIN EVENT. HERE'S THE MATCHES ON THIS TAPE:

1. ALEX WRIGHT VS. PAUL ROMA

A BAD MATCH TO START THIS PAY-PER-VIEW. THIS MATCH COULD'VE AND SHOULD'VE BEEN SAVED FOR AN EPISODE OF WORLDWIDE. RATING: 2/5

2. HACKSAW JIM DUGGAN VS. BUNKHOUSE BUNK

WHY WAS JIM DUGGAN EVEN STILL WRESTLING AT THIS POINT? RATING: 1/5

3. KEVIN SULLIVAN VS. DAVE SULLIVAN

THIS MATCH WAS SIMPLY STUPID. RATING: 1.5/5

4. FOR THE WCW WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS

CHAMPIONS HARLEM HEAT [BOOKER T & STEVIE RAY] VS. THE NASTY BOYS [BRIAN KNOBS & JERRY SAGS]

THIS MATCH WASN'T ALL THAT BAD. IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH MORE MOMENTUM BOOKER T HAD IN WCW THAN HE CURRENTLY HAS NOW IN THE WWE. PROBABLY THE BEST MATCH ON THIS TAPE. AND THAT'S A SHAME, BEING THAT THERE'S 3 MORE MATCHES TO GO AFTER THIS ONE. RATING: 2.5/5

5. BLACKTOP BULLY VS. DUSTIN RHODES

SLOW MOVING AND BORING. IF THE MATCH WAS GONNA BE THIS BORING, THE LEAST THEY COULD'VE DONE WAS MAKE IT SHORTER. RATING: 1/5

6. STING & RANDY SAVAGE VS. AVALANCHE & THE LATE GREAT BIG BUBBA ROGERS

THIS WAS NOT ALL THAT BAD, COMPARED TO A LOT OF THE OTHER MATCHES ON THIS EVENT. BUT IT STILL LEAVES A WHOLE LOT TO BE DESIRED. RATING: 2.5/5

7. FOR THE WCW WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION HULK HOGAN VS. U.S. CHAMPION VADER

YOUR AVERAGE WCW PPV MAIN EVENT. NOTHING TO ANTICIPATE. IT'S ALL PREDICTABLE AND POINTLESS. RATING: 2/5

OVERALL RATING: 2 STARS

AS FAR AS THE QUALITY OF THIS WRESTLING EVENT GOES, THIS IS PRETTY BAD. BUT, IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS BAD AS UNCENSORED '95, WHICH FOLLOWED A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER THIS PAY-PER-VIEW. THIS TAPE IS N0T WORTH LOOKING FOR. BUT, IF YOU ALREADY OWN IT, KEEP IT AND TREASURE IT, BEING THAT IT'S A WCW TAPE AND BEING THAT WCW IS NOW OFFICIALLY OUT OF BUSINESS.",1116633600,,1847,4.528700906344411
