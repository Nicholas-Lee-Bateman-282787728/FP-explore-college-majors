Note also that it is ONLY IN FRENCH. The subtitles are merely French language as well, for people who have hearing impairment, so you must know French to understand it.

This was originally meant to be part of, or a companion piece to, Francois Truffaut's brilliant debut feature, THE 400 BLOWS, and the main character, Justine Casting, was meant to be friends with the main character from that film (and several other Truffaut films), Antoine Doinel. Instead, years later, Truffaut finished a script, but died tragically before he could film it. He gave the script to his friend and fellow director, Claude Berri, and Berri gave it to Claude Miller, who was the perfect person to direct it. As good as the script is (and it has Truffaut's stamp on it every step of the way), Claude Miller made the film ""his,"" and really, the film belongs to its star, the astounding Charlotte Gainsbourg, who, even at 15 is every bit as outstanding as Jean-Pierre Leaud was as the young Antoine. I don't need to mention that Gainsbourg has continued to leave audiences awestruck in her work in a wide variety of films, most recently, those of Lars von Trier.  I have never seen her give a performance that didn't create a character who stayed with me LONG after the film was over.",1510444800,,1457,4.6

8125052,4,B000FOQ08C,"La Petite Voleuse [English: The Little Thief (1988)] as an example of how once a girl reaches puberty she has the potential to have a crush on a much older man. For example, sixteen-year-old green eyed baby faced Janine told her forty-three-year-old lover that, ""The most I ever loved was when I was nine. With a kraut [German soldier] at Nazi HQ. He had nice hair and a gentle voice. I think he was hot for my mom. He said I was exceptional. No guy after that believed in me.""

There are a number of examples of this phenomenon in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Allure-of-Nymphets/dp/B00B6KKY1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Allure of Nymphets</a>&nbsp;from actress Elizabeth Taylor to author Barbara Gordon.

Furthermore, the dialogue in La Petite Voleuse can exemplify how important it is for an ephebophile to treat a nymphet as an adult and not a child, which makes sense when one understands the fact that, according to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Centuries-of-Childhood-A-Social-History-of-Family-Life/dp/0394702867/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life</a>&nbsp;and many other sources, childhood is a relatively recent invention.",1378339200,3,1278,6.4678362573099415
8125053,5,B000FOQ08C,"More so than most directors, Francois Truffaut drew on his personal experiences (e.g., ""400 Blows"") in crafting cinematic tales of the pain and pleasure of growing up. ""The Little Thief"" began as a script idea of Truffaut's in the 1950s, but had never been realized at the time of his untimely death, in 1984. Janine (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is a 15-year-old girl, growing up poor in postwar France. Janine is in a hurry to grow up. But to Janine, who survived as a street urchin during the Nazi occupation, growing up means stealing and getting away with other such petty crimes and losing her virginity ASAP. After being run out of town by the local gendarmes, Janine goes to work as a maid in a rich couple's house and eventually falls in love with an older, married choirmaster (Didier Bezace), who tries to steer Janine away from crime and towards a productive life. Although she finds sex with him exciting, he is much older and their difference in maturity eventually drives the couple apart. Janine then falls in love with a young man, Raoul (Simon de la Brosse), who is from the lower classes, and influences her to drop out of school in order to pull off a heist during a dinner party held by her employers. After getting arrested and landing in reform school, Janine comes to realize that growing up is not all it is cut out to be. She begins turning her life around when she meets a fellow inmate, who teaches her about photography and darkroom printing. After escaping from the reform school, Janine finds that she is pregnant with Raoul's baby. Again, she wants to run away from her problems, and returns to her hometown to visit a back-alley abortionist. But Janine has no money, so the abortionist demands Janine's twin-reflex camera as payment. Assessing the situation, Janine realizes that she's been handed a sucker's deal; She will only end up without a camera and without her baby. So, Janine commits one last crime: She steals back her camera, decides to have her baby and straightens out her life, accepting responsibility for her actions.
The feel of the movie is dead-on for capturing postwar France in 1950: The costumes, the sets, the automobiles, the Path newsreels and the period music all conjure a bygone era with style. Alain Jomy's impressionistic soundtrack recalls the best scores of Georges Delarue.

""The Little Thief"" is a poetic, beautiful, moral tale, but never moralizing. It's easy to relate to Janine's predicament, the urge of the adolescent to break the chains of society. Director Claude Miller uses this fable to teach the important lesson that one can only learn from life by having lived it.",1196553600,5,2638,4.81057268722467
