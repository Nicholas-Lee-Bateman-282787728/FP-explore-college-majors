7800429,5,1613643365,"This is bare bones insight into taking free flowing, happy creatures and savagely taking them from their family and home to put in a concrete box. They're all dying... to perform and entertain for us.  It is a documentary film that Sea World will never sell, endorse or suggest because while they are participating in this film, it is in defense of their barbaric actions to imprison these majestic animals.  Completely gripping and will make you think long and hard before booking your next marine park experience.",1391040000,2,515,4.908045977011494
