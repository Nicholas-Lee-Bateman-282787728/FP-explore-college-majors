8314891,5,1604027789,"What a great video. I enjoyed the scientific evaluation of the authors horse using computer technology to measure what collection really was. The section on wild horse behavior and how dominance manifests in wild herds of horses was really insightful and I wish more stories were presented of wild horses on Aussateague Island. I felt the video was really an overview and I would have liked a lengthier more in depth look at dressage, but even though it was on the short side I enjoyed watching all of it.",1326758400,2,505,4.685393258426966
