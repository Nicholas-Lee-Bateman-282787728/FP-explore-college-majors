494347,4,6302662745,Excellent dark humor and strong stylistic vision. The only reason its 4 and not 5 stars is the ending really looses its footing and does not satisfy the plot's build up.,1502236800,,169,4.483870967741935
494348,1,6302662745,"I'm rating this DVD at 1 star to attract attention of Miramax, who produced this masterpiece of alleged Planned Obsolescence. Third time when was watching this movie on this DVD the very long 8 intros (adverts, reclames) showed as usual and when it came time to view the movie it just went dark. I put another DVD into the player and it was playing just fine. Tried another and another and 30 others and all were fine, apparently not made by Miramax. Now I realised that this particular DVD is made to fail on the third attempt to watch it. What's most frustrating that all the commercial intros show just fine, but not the movie. I am asking (or rather demanding) Miramax to send me a replacement DVD that works and does not stop showing even if I watch it 100 times.

I rate this movie (not the DVD) at 4 stars. Those who did not enjoy it they should watch Hollywood dramas or children's animation.",1499558400,,900,4.421686746987952

494404,5,6302662745,"This film is yet another example of a cult status film, this time from 1991, which enjoys a quirky plot to say the least. Essentially the film is set in the unspecified future within an urban landscape. The main action takes place at the local butcher's shop which has flats let out above to a varied range of inhabitants. Food supplies are scarce, particularly those of meat, so the butcher is a main player.

There is a new tenant taken on by the butcher in the form of a general maintenance man. He is actually an out of work circus clown and he is full of useful and entertaining talents. There is an underground resistance movement which operates underground and makes forays out to the world above for various reasons.

If all of this seems quirky and strange, it is! It is also the cause of much good humoured mirth and the unusual plot and its delivery resulted in 4 Cesar awards the following year for Best Editing, Best First Work, Best Production Design and best Writing. Not surprisingly this debut film of Jeunet and Caro has attracted a keen and loyal following. Others will need to buy the film to find out now all these ingredients work out - it will be worth it.

However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual film as by now it will have both its supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this film.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this film and who have bought the previous DVD version of this disc, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the additional expense.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrade offers a clear advance on both image and audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The whole film simply becomes more 'real.' The film, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality.

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used. The following technical information is intended to be a guide to aid in assessment.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual HDMI signals before they leave separately to the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

The disc offers purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVD.

In summary this fascinating and quirky film has responded well to the upgrade and the BD version is well worth considering.",1474329600,,3324,4.928443649373882
494405,5,6302662745,"Deliciously dark, droll, dystopian classic from the creators of CITY OF LOST CHILDREN.

DELICATESSEN: It's ""Brazil"" meets ""Eating Raoul""--a lite black comedy which pretty much exhausts the thesaurus of synonyms for ""bizarre."" Atmosphere is everything, and it's a benignly nightmarish, happily hallucinatory ambiance, brimming with misshapen faces, odd lighting, wacky angles and insane sets, all of which are too peculiar to be too threatening. The odd lot of freaks and weirdoes who inhabit the building are both grotesque and whimsical, as if drawn by Dr. Seuss on a bad acid trip. For the precious little French spoken in the film, it might as well be silent--except for the fanciful sound effects (the scene in which everyone in the building uses the rhythm of squeaking bedsprings as a metronome for their own activities is worthy of Buster Keaton, for example).

I owned the subtitled laserdisc back in the day, and the Region2 DVD bought before it was domestically available.

This is not a Pan & Scan VHS from 1992. The BluRay format has plenty of room for at least the additonal original language soundtrack and English subtitles.

Instead of critiquing the film, which is, by the way, very good, I'd like to address the setting.

I see from most of the reviews here that people think the film is set in some vague post-apocalyptic limbo. And if one knew nothing about France, I could see how one would get that impression. The movie is actually set in a WWII-in-progress limbo, and it deals with a subject that no one talks about: cannibalism during the German occupation of France. At one point during the film, a motorcycle courier shows up out of nowhere, and the building residents ask him about ""The War"". That's just one of the many hints pointing to occupied France.
There were shortages of everything, especially meat, during the Occupation. And it was much worse in the country than in the big cities. People did whatever they could to survive.
My great-aunt was in the Rsistance in Northern France, and although she didn't talk about it much, I did overhear her talking to my parents about it once. She told them what was done to certain Nazis that were captured or killed. Some of them turned up as meat. Soldier meat was called ""porc"" (""pork""), officer meat was ""boeuf"" (""beef"").
The film puts a darkly humorous face on this, but it is part of the ghosts that haunt France's past.
This happened not just during the Occupation, but also for several years afterwards.
Not many people realize just how much of a beating France took and how long the healing process was.

The most incredible thing is that a film as breathtakingly beautiful as Jean Cocteau's ""La Belle Et La Bte"" (""Beauty And The Beast"") came out in 1946, despite the abject and deep misery of France at that time. It is truly a tribute to the creative spirit of humanity.

495384,4,6302662745,"My friends and I debate the talents of French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet often.  We're talking about a visionary voice in modern filmmaking, and despite ones perception of his filmography, there is no denying that he adds something different, something intriguing and spicy to the mix.  I was far from a fan of his latest entry, `Micmacs', but I consider `Amelie' a blessing and `A Very Long Engagement' to be a very good cinematic effort.  `Delicatessen' is a bizarre comedy that uses horror roots to create something visually vivid.  It doesn't always work, and it loses its footing in meshing the two genres together with ease, but at the end of the day there is something truly engrossing about this tale.  The film revolves around a butcher who uses cannibalism to solve the growing problem of hunger in the post-apocalyptic world he lives in.  His wicked ways are given a shake when his lovesick daughter and his newest employee try and put an end to the death surrounding them.  I love the notion that this is a Terry Gilliam style film, because while watching `delicatessen' I was reminded of `Brazil'.

The Film 4/5

Delicatessen is an unusual film. If you have seen any of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's other works, you'll have an idea of what to expect. There are no jokes, but there is a lot of weird visual humor. It's like meeting a French version of Quentin Tarantino or David Lynch.

The plot, such as it is, is set in an apartment complex above a delicatessen. The butcher, Clapet, hires people to do odd jobs. We are never told what year it is, but the action takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where food is scarce. Clapet's motive for hiring people is to kill them and feed their body to the building's inhabitants. The movie's opening scene shows one such murder.

A new man arrives to apply for the now vacant position. He's Louison (Pinon), an ex-circus clown. He has no money so pays for his taxi with his shoes, and then wears clown shoes for the remainder of the film. Clapet hires him. Pinon has appeared in every Jeunet film in the past 20 years and seems perfectly at home with the director's quirky style.

The building is falling apart and Louison has plenty of work. He is generally well-liked and soon attracts the attention of the butcher's daughter, Julie (Dougnac). An unlikely romance blooms between the two and she begs her father not to kill Louison. She wears glasses and can barely see without them, but takes them off for her first date with Louison. The results are hilarious. She tells him that people in the building get eaten, but he has fallen asleep and misses the warning.

If you have seen the trailer, you'll be familiar with a sequence in which the butcher has sex on a squeaky bed. We are shown various odd characters engaging in weird activities, and they all synchronize their actions with the sound of the springs squeaking. I don't think I have seen anything else like it.

Sound travels through the building's pipes and is used to develop parts of the plot. In an early scene, the camera takes us through a pipe to show where it leads. Very Lynchian.

Jeunet is original, creative, weird and genuinely funny, in a dry sort of way. The overall mix is unique. The film plays more like a series of vaguely connected scenes than a fluid story, but each element has something interesting. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

Video Quality 4.5/5
The world of Delicatessen is filled with mist and grime. Outdoor scenes are deliberately murky and the image looks a little soft and noisy, but such scenes are infrequent. Detail is strong in the remaining scenes and shines during the frequent close-ups. Jeunet's films have unusual color palettes too. For example, Amelie is full of greens and reds. Delicatessen has a reddish-brown tint and it fits the atmosphere well. Apart from the few misty shots, the overall quality is excellent for a film with such a low budget.

Audio Quality 4/5
The French DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mix does its job well. Dialogue is clear and it's easy to hear frogs croaking and water rushing, as well as the unusual musical duets performed by Julie and Louison. The score has a distinctly French feel to it and adds something to the overall mood. Subtitles are displayed in white text and appear inside the frame.

Special Features 4/5

There's plenty of background information to be found for those wanting to know more about the film:

Making of: Fine Cooked Pork Meats (13 minutes)

Trailer and Teaser (4 minutes)

Main Course Pieces (65 minutes)

Audio Commentary (Jeunet's comments in French with optional subtitles)

Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Archives (9 minutes)

What is Delicatessen? Is it a comedy? A romance? Fantasy? Horror? It's a wonderfully unique mess served up as only Jeunet can. If you are already a fan of his work, this fits right in. For those new to it, this is a good place to start. I prefer Amelie and A Very Long Engagement, but Delicatessen has a lot of replay value and I'm happy to have it in my collection. Give it a try if you don't mind foreign language films.

""Delicatessen"", ""The City of Lost Children"", ""Alien Resurrection"", ""Amelie"", ""A Very Long Engagement"", and his latest called ""Micmacs"".

And then perhaps, a special documentary disc celebrating Jean Pierre Jeunet's many film shorts, such as:

""L'evasion"" (1978), ""Le manage"" (1980), ""The Bunker of the Last Gunshots"" (1981), ""Pas de Repos pour Billy Brakko"" (1984), ""Things I like, Things I don't Like"" (1989), and perhaps the many others that may exist.

495450,3,6302662745,"If the Carnegie Deli on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue is famous for its gargantuan pastrami sandwiches, Jeunet's film `Delicatessen' should also be recognized as a big hunk of meat. Human meat, that is.

`Delicatessen' is set in a post-apocalyptic world somewhere between the grim industrial ugliness of Lynch's `Eraserhead' and the French WWII-era folklore of Barratier's `Les Choristes'.  In a dire age where food is scarce and rationing tickets are of the essence, people have long resigned themselves to cannibalism and human meat has become a prized, well, delicacy.
While `Delicatessen' is about the misadventures of a former clown as he struggles to flee slaughter by his landlord-turned-butcher, the film is also about butchering its characters until there is not much left for the spectator to be hungry about when it comes to human nature. The blood-hungry greed of the majority of `Delicatessen's residents (who happily pay tribute to a butchered grandmother by picking up one of her prime cuts at the meat shop the following day) might be enough to distress some viewers.

But if that isn't enough, just take a look at the film's saving grace. Sure, in the end love transcends greed and the star-cross'd lovers escape the brutal mores of the general population, but make no mistake - this is no Romeo and Juliet. In the lady's role, meet Julie, an ugly hag with obscenely dorky glasses; and in the gentleman's role, meet Louison, an awkward chap looks like what a midget might look like if he were to suddenly grow five feet tall.

The point is that `Delicatessen's characters are not attractive, and that they are not intended to be. This is a tongue-in-cheek movie that will confuse you and make you laugh and make you ask yourself whether our world is any less confusing or any more attractive. While the answer to both questions is probably yes (hopefully), you will walk out from Jeunet's film either spelling out the WTF question or exclaiming: ""That moo-tuning scene was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen."" Or both.",1263340800,9,2038,4.950292397660819

But Jean-Pierre Jeunet did an entirely different kind of comedy in ""Delicatessen,"" a wicked black comedy that deals with... um... er.... cannibalism. As in, people eating people. The resulting movie is a truly twisted, dark story populated by the strangest, oddest characters that the writer could possibly have imagined -- cannibal butchers, rebel vegetarians, and ex clowns. And hoo, is it funny!

It's the postapocalyptic future, where food is so scarce that grain is used as money, and meat is completely gone. The setting is an apartment building run by a local butcher Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who feeds his tenants in an unusual way: he hires assistants, then turns them into tomorrow's din-din. His newest assistant is the gentle vegetarian ex-clown Louison (Dominic Pinon).

But the butcher's plans get thrown for a loop when his cello-playing daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls for Stanley and (unsurprisingly) wants to save her love from a fate worse than entrees. So she contacts the vegetarian resistance -- the sewer-dwelling Troglodytes -- and tricks them into invading her father's house, on the night when he plans to slaughter Louison. Then things get really weird.

Okay, let's get this straight: cannibalism is not funny. It's sick and evil and grotesque.

But comedies about cannibalism CAN be very funny, if done well -- and ""Delicatessen"" is done very, very well. It manages to be a funny comedy in the tradition of Terry Gilliam, with the warped direction, surreal direction and strange settings, as well as some deeply, horribly funny characters. What was later precious in ""Amelie"" is weirdly ominous here... not that that's a bad thing. It's quite suitable, actually.

It's also a challenge to create such a dark, bleak setting and somehow inject lots of dark, offbeat comedy into it. For example, one sex scene is juxtaposed against various activities (carpet beating, cello playing) -- all in the same rhythm. It's a moment of pure comic skill. But at the same time, Jeunet slips a bittersweet love story into the middle of the strangeness, relying on Pinon and Dougnac's strong chemistry and relatively innocent characters.

The oddities of the characters in this little hotel are what take this dark comedy to the next level: a tough postman, a pair of brothers who make ""moo"" boxes, and an aristocratic old lady who goes to great -- and unsuccessful -- lengths to kill herself, Rube Goldberg-style. Julie and the innocent Louison are the bright spot of normalcy and love, but the Troglodytes are a bit over-the-top. Really, must they be THAT dumb?

""Delicatessen"" is an acquired taste. Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, here's the real end of the review: Jean-Pierre Jeunet's dark comedy is a bit hard to swallow at first, but the wickedly funny characters and offbeat script will win you over.",1243900800,3,3033,5.027888446215139

Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also gave us the equally quirky and delightful ""City of Lost Children,"" the film begins in a post-apocalyptic and dying world in which nothing grows and ends in a reborn one where blue skies and fruitful earth has returned.  The action takes place in a half-ruined apartment building whose residents are kept from starving by the Sweeney Todd-like practices of their landlord, a butcher.  But the butcher's daughter, wonderfully played by Marie-Laure Dougnac, and the ex-clown who comes to work for her father, put an end to the nefarious practice.

The visuals of the film are incredible.  To underscore the theme of butchery and meat-eating, the very walls of the apartment building, in both color and texture, look vaguely like meat.  Long drainage pipes, which the camera frequently follows from the inside, look like esophagus and stomach passageways and intestines.

The visual surreality is matched by the surreal characters:  a rich resident named Aurore whose Rube Goldberg-complicated attempts at suicide all end in failure; a resident who lives in the basement, regularly floods his dwelling to cultivate mold, slime, and snails, which he then devours with gusto; two roommates who make those little cans which, when turned upside down, emit a lugubrious ""moo""; a family with demon kids and an aged grandmom who eventually gets turned into pate; the butcher himself who loves his work; the clown who cames to dinner; and a bunch of revolutionaries who call themselves the Troglydites and are as inept as a bunch of Keystone Cops.

Complications ensue when he falls in love with the butcher's daughter and she enlists the aid of an underground group of vegetarian terrorists to help her save him.

What starts out as just your average cannibalism comedy gradually wins you over, drawing you into the damaged lives of the block's credibly eccentric inhabitants, and even comes up with an entirely new way to get out of a trapped bathroom, but not one I'd recommend trying at home (unless you're being pursued by a cannibalistic butcher, of course). Nice little touches abound, such as the butcher's clumsy short-sighted daughter buying two of everything in case she breaks them or the granny who has tin cans tied to her so that her family can find her if she gets lost (no prizes for guessing what happens to her). You may not think you'll like it, but you probably will in spite of yourself...

495643,4,6302662745,"Jeunet and Caro created one of the most memorable films of the early 1990's with Delicatessen. It blends the comic with the strange in ways that no other film has done before or since. It is one of those films that I know I enjoyed but I really can't say why.

The film takes place in post apocalyptic France where goods are bought and sold with grain and corn. Meat is nowhere to be found. Cannibalism seems to be the practiced norm. The tenants above the butcher shop of Clapet(Jean-Claude Dreyfus) have an arrangement in which they will not eat each other as long as the butcher supplies them with alternate sources of meat. This he does by hiring handymen to do odd jobs around the building who eventually turn up on the menu. His plan works fine until he hires the rubber faced ex-clown Louison (Dominique Pinon). Louison befriends Clapet's near sighted daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac)who spends the film trying to save him from her father's evil plan by joining an underground vegetarian resistance group trying to overthrow the government.

If all this sounds confusing rest assured it is. But there are enough comic moments to make the entire film worthwhile. The building is filled with an assortment of odd characters who are always amusing to watch. The photography and set design are great and the Chaplinesque slapstick and physical comedy are lots of fun.

The disc features a commentary track (subtitled) by Juenet and two making of features along with trailers and teasers. All in all this is a fun if strange viewing experience that reminds me of some of the classic work of Terry Gilliam.

495646,2,6302662745,"Fans of Eraserhead are almost certain to love it, but to me nearly the best thing in Delicatessen are the opening titles.

First a techical complaint.  The first copy would not load in my modern player.  The replacement had the same problem.  I put it into an old DVD player relegated to the basement and it worked fine.  Copy protection prevented me from copying to my DVD recorder via direct connection (first time I'ver ever tried).  I suppose I could make a copy playable in my main DVD player by using a VCR as a go-between, but quality would certainly suffer and the movie really isn't worth the re-wiring effort.

My French is poor and I find subtitles distracting.  Couldn't it at least have an alternate audio track dubbed into English as the French insist for English movies?  The interpretation into English is as poor as you find in the worst Japanese monster movies--filled with cliche and nearly incomprehensible slang.

Zero explanation is given for a thin premise, entire plot elements were nonsensical to me and an entire escape sequence is so ridiculous that it makes those in the latest ""Die Hard"" look almost plausible.

The acting is a mixed bag:  occasionally very good, but the overall level is drug down by some ridiculous performances in perposterous circumstance.

The photography is excellent.  Unusual, changing camera angles and distorted perspective are used to their best effect.  Audio quality is very good and some unusual songs are very nice.

a chronically depressed would-be

The only real problem with this new region 1 release is that the english subtitles are terrible and very often cover up the faces of the actors on the screen.  What king of incompetent did this?

495678,5,6302662745,"Delicatessen is the feel good post-apocalyptic Parisian cannibalism dark comedy of the 90's, possibly of all time.  Directed by Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (who later created the masterful City Of Lost Children) Delicatessen defies traditional analysis, one simply enters this thoroughly strange, visually dazzling world and experiences layer upon layer of delight.  (That Jeunet also directed the disarmingly charming Amelie does not inform Delicatessen, one could hardly find two more dissimilar movies.)

From the brilliantly inventive titles to the final credits, Delicatessen is an art director's movie determined to produce a feast for the eyes; logic, plot, even character are secondary.  Caro and Jeunet were clearly influenced by co-producer Terry Gilliam, that sense of relentless visual wizardry present in his masterpiece, Brazil, is very much in evidence.  Gilliam, in addition to being one of our greatest, and most fearlessly original, directors is best remembered as the Monty Python that did the sick cartoons.

As in Brazil, sense of time is intentionally misdirected.  Ostensibly we are in a somewhat futuristic, post-cataclysmic setting, but architecture, furnishings, and wardrobe suggest pre-WWII.  The plot, little more than a vehicle for the legion of idiosyncratic comedic characters, is beyond ludicrous.  A demonic butcher, played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus, runs a rooming house and occasionally slaughters a tenant to provide food for the ones that remain.  They pay him in grain.  In the sewers below, a colony of mole people avoid contact with the above ground crowd, subsist as they can, and refuse to consume meat.

Into this madhouse wanders an innocent ex-clown, played with real comic genius by Dominique Pinon.  (Pinon and Dreyfus also excel in City Of Lost Children).  The clown, Louison, has had a career setback; ravenous circus go-ers ate his chimpanzee, Dr. Livingstone.  He falls in love with the butcher's gentle, and nearly blind, daughter who tries to protect him from the horrid fate her father has planned.  Meanwhile, one tenant floods his apartment so he can raise frogs and snails for food, a clinically depressed but perfectly coiffed aristocrat thinks she hears voices and devises intricate, unsuccessful, means of committing suicide, while a blue collar family wrestles with the ethical consequences of letting granny be converted into pate.

Over the top - yes - but the joke never gets stale.  There are far too many brilliant comic vignettes to mention, the acting is superb, not one sour note.  From musical saws to bedspring symphonies, this movie has it all.  Definitely worth owning.  This is bad taste that tastes good.",1155600000,7,2682,5.368421052631579
495679,5,6302662745,"Delicatessen marked the impressive feature film debut of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, two mad geniuses from France who would sadly make only one other film together (the Terry Gilliam-esque City of Lost Children) before going their separate ways. Delicatessen displayed an inventiveness in their sometimes surreal imagery but also with quirky, endearing characters they so expertly crafted. Jeunet and Caro presented a rich, atmospheric world that was the stuff of dreams... or nightmares depending on who you talk to.

Director of photography Darius Khondji shoots the entire film through a sepia tone filter, enshrouding the outside world in a thick fog that creates an ominous mood and gives Delicatessen the look of an old photograph (a look that Jeunet would adopt again with A Very Long Engagement). This is in turn enhanced by the industrial soundscape as if we've wandered into the desolate neighbourhood in Eraserhead. Jeunet's film has some of the most exquisite production design this side of a Gilliam film. The attention to detail is incredible and certainly invites repeated screenings in order to catch all of little things buried in the background of scenes.

Fans of Jeunet's films have had to wait for what seems like forever for Delicatessen to be released on Region 1 DVD and finally the wait is over. For people who only know his work through Amelie, this is a chance to see where that movie came from. Delicatessen was the blueprint for all other Jeunet films to follow, featuring an irrepressible protagonist who injects a sense of engaging child-like wonderment into an otherwise cynical world.

There is an audio commentary by Jean-Pierre Jeunet who tells all kinds of anecdotes and explains what inspired certain shots or where certain props came from. This is a very engaging and informative track that is definitely worth a listen.

""Fine Cooked Meats: A Nod to Delicatessen"" features a lot of on the set footage of scenes from the film being shot. It shows how much work went into the film but doesn't provide any insight or context, which, I suppose, is the purpose of the commentary.

""The Archives of Jean-Pierre Jeunet"" features a collection of behind-the-scenes footage, including Pinon auditioning, rehearsal footage of scenes not in the movie, and Jeunet scouting locations for certain scenes that are juxtaposed with what they look like in the finished film.

I have seen of all Jean-Pierre Jeunnet's movies ever since.

I absolutely recomond this movie and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.  I have been waiting for this movie to finally come out on DVD, it has been a long long time.",1147737600,3,550,4.190476190476191
495681,4,6302662745,"WOOHOO! I just finished watching this DVD. Wow...it's cool to finally have this come out in this format domestically. I'd caught this in the theater upon release then on  funky VHS copies through the later years. First, I have to say, even when I first saw this film years ago, I had a mixed bag of feelings. I loved it for its surreal, wonderfully bleak atmosphere. The clausterphobia and lunacy work well in this movie. But always at some point I catch myself thinking ""What the Hell is this crap?"" Then I proceed to continue watching the film all wide eyed and enthralled in it's somewhat magical quality......well...then I start wondering ""what the Hell is this crap?"" again. I love it. It *is* an acquired taste...even when you think you like it.

So yea...anyway: The DVD.......the transfer is quite nice. If you've seen the film, it's bathed in this glowing post nuclear amberish glow throughout. Strangely, the colors come through vibrantly on this print, and seem even moreso than when I saw it at the theater...or at least what I remember it to look like. I have no complaints about the transfer. I'd just purchased my first 16:9 flat panel TV and it was a pleasure to watch this fill up the screen. The 1.85:1 ratio-thingy is exactly that, no black bars (for those who might be wondering how it will look on their screen). I'm beginning to understand all these ratio things, I've seen some other discs state said ratio, but still have them bars, this sucked up the entire screen. Anyhow.....there are english subtitles as one would expect. On the case it says for the special features there may be none . But actually on the two Special Features included, there are some english subtitles where applicable.

And speaking of Special Features: There are technically two. ""FINE COOKED MEATS"" which consists if memory serves right, approx. 13 minutes of behind the scenes, (I assume) outtakes, and a variety of scenes from the movie but they are shot from a different angle; someone's camera etc etc. All of these bits and pieces are basically edited together into this 'feature'. There's not any real commentary for this OR the other Extra. When a scene has talking, THAT is translated. ""The Archives Of JPJ"" consists mostly of rehearsals and such with some comparison shots from the movie as well as some rehearsals and actual movie scenes edited together to play off of each other for an interesting effect. These I don't think lasted 10 minutes. Then there's the trailers, which hardly count for much. I have not and probably won't watch the film for awhile with JPJ's commentary, so you're on your own on how that is (Though I'm interested to hear what he has to say about the film). I'd say if you were looking for lotsa Extras, you'll be disappointed. They definitely could have added some comments for the features given visually, some of the scenes looked deserving of some explanation. In fact, they could've edited BOTH SF's together into one long feature and been done with it as the 'Archives' don't look any more important than the 'Fine Cooked...' segments.  I guess we should be happy this finally got to DVD here and take the little 'donations' towards our wait and run.....we coulda been stuck with just a trailer or two. But considering the new release price is pretty steep (near 30 bucks at its highest), they coulda fattened up the package a bit.

VERDICT: THE FILM--- 4...not perfect......but not 'just OK'...and DEFINITELY worth at least one viewing to judge for yourself.

THE DVD RELEASE: When all the dust settles from being happy to finally put this in the collection here settles....I can tell you, this will be one DVD package that will suck. Foreign films usually either get the bells & whistles treatment or they get *this*. A package where the designers/company spent so much time digging up old critics' acclaims/quotes to paste all over the box art that they forgot to focus on CONTENT (the little sheet of chapter selections on one side and an AD for JPJ's films on the other are a good example of lazy output).

  The central joke in the film, that others seem to miss, is that the characters aren't driven by hunger.  Yes, it's set in some undisclosed time of bleak social collapse where meat is very, very scarce.  Yes, an enterprising butcher uses certain tenants to do little jobs around the apartment building he owns before chopping them up and selling them to his other tenants (who are all in on it by the way).  But the tenants buy the meat with dried grain and corn and beans.  Not just a handful of grain, but quite a bit.  More grain than meat.  Think about that for a second.  They're not starving.  They could easily use that grain to make a myriad of meals, but instead they use it to buy meat.  Not because they need it, but because they want it.  Then, out of the swirling ever present fog, stumbles an unassuming, down on his luck ex-clown looking for work and everything goes to hell.  Well, mostly everything.

495718,5,6302662745,"You probably know him best for ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement,"" but Jean-Pierre Jeunet did an entirely different kind of comedy in ""Delicatessen,"" a wicked black comedy that deals with... um, cannibalism. It's a twisted, dark story populated by the oddest characters that the writer could possibly have imagined -- and man, is it funny.

It's the postapocalyptic future, where food is so scarce that grain is used as money, and meat is completely gone. The setting is an apartment building run by a local butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who feeds his tenants in an unusual way: he hires assistants, then turns them into tomorrow's din-din. His newest assistant is the gentle vegetarian ex-clown Louison (Dominic Pinon).

But the butcher's plans get thrown for a loop when his cello-playing daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls for Stanley and (unsurprisingly) wants to save her love from a fate worse than entrees. So she contacts the vegetarian resistance, the Troglodytes, and tricks them into invading her father's house, on the night when he plans to slaughter Louison.

Okay, let's get this straight: cannibalism is not funny. But comedies about cannibalism CAN be very funny, if done well. And ""Delicatessen"" manages to be a funny comedy in the tradition of Terry Gilliam, with the warped direction, surreal direction and strange settings. What was later precious in ""Amelie"" is weirdly ominous here... not that that's a bad thing.

It's also a challenge to create such a dark, bleak setting and somehow inject offbeat comedy into it. For example, one sex scene is juxtaposed against various activities (carpet beating, cello playing) -- all in the same rhythm. It's a moment of pure comic skill. But at the same time, Jeunet slips a bittersweet love story into the middle of the strangeness, relying on Pinon and Dougnac's strong chemistry.

The oddities of the characters are what take this dark comedy to the next level: a tough postman; a pair of brothers who make ""moo"" boxes, and an aristocratic old lady who goes to great -- and unsuccessful -- lengths to kill herself, Rube Goldberg-style. Julie and the innocent Louison are a bright spot, but the Troglodytes are a bit over-the-top. Really, must they be THAT dumb?

""Delicatessen"" is an acquired taste. Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, here's the real end of the review: Jean-Pierre Jeunet's dark comedy is a bit hard to swallow at first, but the wickedly funny characters and offbeat script will win you over.",1138233600,50,2500,5.0120481927710845

495758,5,6302662745,"You probably know him best for ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement,"" but Jean-Pierre Jeunet did an entirely different kind of comedy in ""Delicatessen,"" a wicked black comedy that deals with... um, cannibalism. It's a twisted, dark story populated by the oddest characters that the writer could possibly have imagined -- and man, is it funny.

It's the postapocalyptic future, where food is so scarce that grain is used as money, and meat is completely gone. The setting is an apartment building run by a local butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who feeds his tenants in an unusual way: he hires assistants, then turns them into tomorrow's din-din. His newest assistant is the gentle vegetarian ex-clown Louison (Dominic Pinon).

But the butcher's plans get thrown for a loop when his cello-playing daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls for Stanley and (unsurprisingly) wants to save her love from a fate worse than entrees. So she contacts the vegetarian resistance, the Troglodytes, and tricks them into invading her father's house, on the night when he plans to slaughter Louison.

Okay, let's get this straight: cannibalism is not funny. But comedies about cannibalism CAN be very funny. And ""Delicatessen"" manages to be a funny comedy in the tradition of Terry Gilliam, with the warped direction and strange settings. What was later precious in ""Amelie"" is weirdly ominous here... not that that's a bad thing.

It's also a challenge to create such a dark, bleak setting and somehow inject offbeat comedy into it. For example, one sex scene is juxtaposed against various activities (carpet beating, cello playing) -- all in the same rhythm. It's a moment of pure comic skill. But at the same time, Jeunet slips a bittersweet love story into the middle of the strangeness, relying on Pinon and Dougnac's strong chemistry.

The oddities of the characters are what take this dark comedy to the next level: a tough postman; a pair of brothers who make ""moo"" boxes, and an aristocratic old lady who goes to great -- and unsuccessful -- lengths to kill herself, Rube Goldberg-style. Julie and the innocent Louison are a bright spot, but the Troglodytes are a bit over-the-top. Really, must they be THAT dumb?

""Delicatessen"" is an acquired taste. Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, here's the real end of the review: Jean-Pierre Jeunet's dark comedy is a bit hard to swallow at first, but the wickedly funny characters and offbeat script are winning.",1106092800,2,2461,5.019607843137255

The movie is actually quite witty at times, which I suppose you wouldn't expect from a movie with a cannibalistic theme. The best part, I'd have to say, is the breathtaking cinematography.

A word to the wise, though:  Certain parts are a bit cringeworthy... so subtly sadistic it made me wonder if I saw it correctly.

495762,4,6302662745,"That was my impression after watching through this very strange movie.
I had started watching it expecting a ""weird French film"", and that was indeed what I got at first.  I couldn't believe the atmosphere that the directors had created in this film, though I imagine it might have been somewhat familiar to some Francophones living in the destruction after WW2.  The introductory sequence to this film is MASTERFULLY shot, and it raised my expectations quite a bit.
Unfortunately, the same level of energy didn't seem to last when the movie really started. The atmosphere was fantastic, yes, and the inventions that were made in this movie (a MUSICAL SAW?) were totally unique.  However, no amount of weird atmosphere can amend a movie if the story and characters aren't up to the job.  In fact, it's a lot harder to create good characters & plot for a movie like this, because the movie has to make sense within its own unique world and yet make us the viewers feel like something REAL is at stake.
For a while, it seemed like Delicatessen was only as deep as its cover; scenes whose only purpose seemed to be to show the inventions of the movie dragged on too long, and the various conversations that the tenants of the apartment building had (I'm assuming you know the general story here) seemed to have no meaning. The Troglodytes that came in about 1/2-way through also didn't quite seem to fit in.
However, by the end of the movie all was justified. I realized just what an enormous task the movie had done; this is not a story of just the two main characters, but a story of at about a dozen tenants of the apartment building.  By the end of the movie, each tenant of the apartment building was portrayed as a unique individual, and each had their own story. These mini-stories are masterfully weaved through the main plot of the movie, and much to the movie's benefit, because I came to care for these secondary characters as much as for the main ones.
The movie was also DEEPLY disturbing for me to watch. It doesn't wince at talking about the subject of cannibalism, and the true worth of a human being. It was very disconcerning when I realized, near the end, that this movie had something to say about OUR world as well, and it was not a very approving message.
As strange as it may sound, this could really happen.

The question is whether the circus performer has some tricks in his bag that can help him survive.  Despite the gruesome plot of Delicatessen, the film offers warm and sensitive drama as well as hysterical comedy that will mesmerize the audience as the story unfolds.

495827,3,6302662745,"For the most part people who watch Delicatessen will be those looking back into the back catelogue of Amelie director Jeunet.  His first work is set in a post-apocalyptic world without meat where the inhabitants of a small appartment block are sustained by the local butcher who chops up new guests and doles them out.  This seems to be the plan for newcomer Pinon, but once he falls in love with the butcher's daughter the couple decide a life with an underground organisation of vegetarians would be a more fulfilling lifestyle and plan to leave.
Visually this is a real treat, and the close-ups of characters' expressions as well as the wonderful set of character idiosyncracies that are evoked are all very reminiscent of Amelie.  In particular the woman who constantly attempts suicide in overly elaborate situations but always manages to get it wrong somehow is fantastic fun, and the mannered performances from all concerned suit the tone of the piece perfectly.  The idea itself is also enjoyably off-kilter, enough so to rightfully earn it a cult audience.
So why only three stars when there's so much that's right with the movie?  Well, as it stands Delicatessen is a vastly inventive movie (certainly more than most) and there are a great deal of incidental things to enjoy (a boomerang fighting weapon, a room flooded by frogs and a disastrous first date) that are mostly based on the kind of situation comedy that Jeunet is so good at.  However, it's not as accessible as Amelie and whilst it stands as a stunningly original genre piece there's little story thread despite the nicely performed fairytale romance between the leads.  Most likely you'll appreciate Delicatessen for its originality but its concept and visuals aside, this just isn't as good as the bowl-you-over spectacular Amelie, although it's definitely worth seeking out for fans of the director or for fans of oddball movie-making.",1045699200,7,1912,4.9937106918239
495828,5,6302662745,"Yes, most of the reviews on this are correct.  There are vegetarian terrorists and there are cannibalists at work here at the wonderfully silly and odd Delicatessen.

In his commentary on Amelie, the director did lament on some of the copies of Delicatessen that were out in theaters.  Here's a chance once and for all to make those corrections and make a specatcular DVD.",1044230400,,625,4.706422018348624
495829,4,6302662745,"In a post-apocalyptic France, the survivors of a decrepit tenement building are clinging on to what's left of life.  Corn is used as currency, only people with connections can get good food or luxury items.  Some people, like the sexy Ms. Plusse, can have her food put on her bill.  To which another woman says caustically ""we know where she keeps her bill.""  And if someone can't pay the rent, they might have to give up one of their family members to the piggish ogre of a butcher and landlord, who slices them into cutlets to sell.
Enter Louison, an ex-circus artist, who takes on a job as a handyman.  He makes a difference to certain people, especially the butcher's meek, nearsighted daughter Julie, and to two young children, who are awestruck at soap bubbles and a handy boomerang knife, dubbed the Australian.  He used to be a clown in a double act, ""Stan and Livingstone"", where he was Stan.  His partner vanished, presumably dead and eaten, and he seems next in line to be eaten, just like the last handyman.
There are many weird tenants.  There's Aurore, a woman who hears voices in her heads urging her to commit suicide.  The way she organizes them is amusing.  A pair of toymakers make boxes that go ""moo!""  There's a down-and-out man who lives with his wife, mother-in-law, and children, and Ms. Plusse, who watches old movies on TV when she isn't paying her bill to the butcher.  A man lives in a flooded room, raising frogs and snails for food.  In one scene, he speaks to an escargot before eating it, ""Hercule, it's every man for himself.""  He tosses the shell, where it lands on a mountain of snail shells.
One funny sequence involves a symphony of sounds, all done in sync in one-two time.  There's the butcher ""accepting payment of his bill"" from Ms. Plusse (squeaking bedsprings), a woman pounding her rug, Julie on her cello, a metronome, a sewing machine, knitting needles, and Louison painting the ceiling with a roller.  So the sounds go ""squeak squeak"", ""pound pound"", ""tick tock"", ""click click"", ""squish squish"" to make up a symphonic montage of sounds and film.
Then there are the Troglodytes, an underground band of outlaws who avoid the surface to avoid being eaten.  Co-director Marc Caro plays the Trog that wears thick-rimmed glasses.
The nighttime scenes in particular reflect the dismal hopelessness of the world, and it's only Louison and Julie who try to make a difference, yearning for hope.
Domininque Pinon (Louison) would later come out in Amelie, directed by Delicatessen's other co-director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, as Gina's ex-beau with the tape-recorder.  Jean-Claude Dreyfus pulls a strong performance as the odious butcher, as does Marie-Laure Dougnac as Julie, Karin Viard as Plusse, and Silvie Laguna as Aurore.
This movie won't go over well with some people, given the subject matter of cannibalism and an ugly post-nuclear future without hope where it's dog-eat-dog, or should that be human-eat-human?
