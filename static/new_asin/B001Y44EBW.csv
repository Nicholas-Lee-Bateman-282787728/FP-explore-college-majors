3829411,5,B001Y44EBW,"My Top 10 Film List seems to get a little more expansive each year, but CHERRY BLOSSOMS is definitely on it. It is profound in its simplicity. The Plot: Wife (Hannelore Elsner) discovers that her husband (Elmar Wepper) of many years is dying. He doesn't know it & she doesn't tell him. She manages to arrange a trip with their adult chirldren living in Berlin, although he would prefer to stay home. The children aren't informed about his condition. Wife dies unexpectedly. Husband is lost without her. He goes to visit son Karl who lives in Tokyo. Father hooks up with a young dancer. Karl assumes the worst.

Those are the bare bones.

What we learn about the relationships is where the more meaningful elements are revealed.

For one thing, we learn that the wife has a more or less hidden love of the Japanese performance/dance called Butoh (boo-toe). It is not clear how this transpired since, until recently, Butoh was not well known outside Japan. An understanding of Butoh is really helpful when viewing CHERRY BLOSSOMS, but not absolutely necessary. Key elements are illustrated by Tadashi Endo in a scene set in Berlin where the dancer is performing. The girl (Aya Irizuki) in Japan (who is rehearsing outdoors a performance involving a pink telephone with a long cord) is a dedicated Butoh performer as well.

The colors of pink, green & white are found everywhere in the movie, but subtly increase in intensity when the husband goes to Japan. I think I became aware of this only towards the end of the film, but when I watched the film again it was much more apparent. Naturally this represents the colors associated with ""Cherry Blossom Time""--a sort of national event in Japan. I think the green symbolizes the leaves & the pink & white the flower. I also think white symbolizes death. It's interesting how this color scheme is naturally enhanced in Japan, in the neon lights of Tokyo, in the food, and the kimonos quests all wear in an informal hotel near Mt. Fuji.

As for Butoh, it emerged as a performance art in post-WWII Japan, partially as a reaction to the the restriction imposed on dancers by the traditional Nh. There are 2 main types of Butoh. One is the basically non-movement variety, and the other that relies on agility and at least some familiarity with traditional dance, even ballet. The images portrayed are more often than not, visceral themes of death, blood--and eventual trandscendece. The artists are almost nude (with body paint) in many scenes. Elements of lighting & set are important & reflect post-WWI German expressionism. I believe it has influenced performers like Marilyn Manson, Madonna & others, and films like The Cell. It is distictly surrealistic.

When the wide goes to the Berlin performance, she tries to coach her husband, but he will not go. Instead he waits outside the theatre, staring at the walls with artistic graffeti. Clearly, he is a man set in ways, resistant to change. Be that as it may, that evening he watches as his wife begins to dance, and she finally gets him to do some movements with her. This scene was powerful because it showed just how devoted he was to her.

Their children don't undertand them, particularly him. There is residual resentment against him resulting from his rather aloof parenting. They resented that their mother was so solicitous In fact there is a strong suggestion that the lone daughter is a Lesbian, carrying on light-hearted dalliance with her sister-in-law (who is the only member of the immediate family who seems sympathetic to either parent.) With the death of their mother in Berlin, they don't know what to do with their father. He solves their dilemma by suddenly going to Tokyo to vistit the single son who lives there.

The father goes basically unannounced & definitely not invited. He takes a single suitcase with him. Among the few items in it are his wife's (cherry blossom) kimono, her (green) sweater, skirt and...all the money he has cleaned out from his bank account.

And here this review ends, I don't want to give any more away.

Well, two more things. The actress who plays the Butoh artist is absolutely wonderful. She appears to be a trained dancer & acts a messenger from the world of the living to the realm of the dead.

The sequence in Japan has a startling & perfectly cathartic conclusion.

3829412,5,B001Y44EBW,"cherry blossoms has become my all-time favorite movie, and I see a lot.  The camera crew caught sensitive light and color movement that makes the film sparkle, it would be breathtaking on a larger screen.
the story line, what we think we know about each other and what is really going on, is as old as time but very freshly approached here.  I have loaned it to everyone I know.  This is a love story.

3829413,5,B001Y44EBW,"Cherry Blossoms is an oddly absorbing film. The story is presented in two parts: The first half takes place in Germany and focuses on the inter-generational tension resulting from a visit of the patents (Rudi and Trudi) to see their grown children, who are too busy and do not want to be bothered. In the midst of their visit, Trudi unexpectedly dies in her sleep and Rudi is devastated (not so much out of love as out of need: Rrudi is a rather self-absorbed and selfish person). This part of the film is entirely too long and could easily be cut in half (but suffer through it. The second half is a gem). The second half, which takes place in Tokyo after Trudi dies, focuses on two people: Rudi and a young homeless girl who practices modern Japanese dance in the park in order to communicate with her dead mother. This is where Rudi begins his journey of self-discovery from his self-adsorbed personage into a more spiritual relationship with his dead wife.  The Japanese scenery brings the spiritual themes into sharp focus. Cherry Blossoms has an unexpectedly strong emotional punch.",1253923200,3,1088,4.726315789473684
3829414,4,B001Y44EBW,"Safe to say, you've never seen a movie like this one. Best to read something about butoh first. Then be prepared to follow the journey of the film's central character from a dull, daily routine half way round the world to a deeply personal expression of grief far beyond the power of words.

The cherry blossoms of the title, are the actual cherry blossoms that briefly bloom in Tokyo each spring, and they are a metaphor for the beautiful and all-too-brief course of a single human life. If the reviews for the film tend to gush, it's because, like butoh itself, what it has to say about life and death can surprise and move you far out of your own daily routine. Wonderful performances by Elmar Wepper and Aya Irizuki, and a lovely music track.",1252195200,4,746,4.525925925925926
3829415,5,B001Y44EBW,"'Cherry Blossoms' is a quiet film that sneaks into your heart and is so unpredictable in interesting ways.  This film shows us the cultural differences between Japanese and German lives.  This is a story of Trudi and Rudi, a Bavarian couple, and their grown children who have grown apart and find little time for their parents.

 Trudi is called into their physician's office to be told that Rudi has a terminal disease, and she is asked if Rudi should be told. She does not respond, but we know her decision is 'no'. She is advised he has some time and a trip of their lifetime might be a good choice. Right away my hackles rose, how unethical- but as the film moves on I forgot this ethical lapse and fell into the story.  Trudi talks hard working Rudi into visiting their two children in Berlin. Even though she would much prefer to visit their son, Karl in Japan. Trudi has had a life long yearning to study the Japanese dance, Butoh and to visit Mt. Fuji. But,l she has devoted her life to her husband and her children. Karl, it seems was her favorite and the other children lived with this knowledge.  Off they go to Berlin instead, to find their children immersed in their own lives with no time for them. It is the lover of one of the children who makes the most time for them, and begins to understand Trudi as a woman not only a mother. Complications arise and soon Rudi finds that the woman he called his wife was also someone who had other interests. He visits Karl in Tokyo and once again it is someone outside the family who spends time with Rudi and understands the grief that has enveloped him. A young girl develops a friendship with him, and it is she who has studied Butho dancing and shows Rudi his expressive, artistic side.

The German filmmaker, Doris D&ouml;rrie has made a marvelous emotionally full film about this German couple.  Trudi played by Hannelore Eisner and Rudi, played by Elmer Wrapper, grow on us. We can feel their bonds and the family issues; their children with busy lives without time for them. The title of the film, Cherry Blossoms, takes it name from the Tokyo blooms, that bloom for just a short time. We find that Rudi transforms and that the life he led with his wife, Trudi was indeed a special one, and in the end it is those we love that make our lives what they are.

A lovely film about love, life and death. The Japanese dance Butoh brings a special expression into this film that will resonate for a long time. The film is a travelogue in part and we get to visit the exquisite countries of Germany and Japan.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 08-02-09

3829416,5,B001Y44EBW,"Andrew Sarris (film critic of the New York Observer) called this the first ""great"" film of 2009 and it is hard to disagree. Although it is a German film, it is infused with an Asian, particularly a Japanese point of view.  Central to the film is the Butoh dance which was developed as an abstract form of modern dance. It meant originally - dance of darkness. When first performed, the dance was a subversive art form but today it resembles expressionist modern dance - possibly influenced by the traditional Noh technique.

In content and in form, the film is a poem of love.  When an elderly wife realizes her husband has only a short time to live, she keeps the information a secret but tries to get him involved with visiting the children (after a long absence) and beginning an adventure, completing the things he wanted to do most but left undone.  It turns out that the wife dies first, unexpectedly. This momentous event causes the husband to re-examine his life and his relationships and to travel to Japan which his wife always wanted to do. And so he walks in his love's path and in doing so eventually become totally united with her soul.

The film is influenced by the well recognized Japanese film master Ozu - particularly his ""Tokyo Story"" - but I would say it ends on a more sublime note.  In every way, the symbol of the ""cherry blossom"" which blooms for just a short period of time but is exceptionally beautiful when it does, is the hidden meaning of the story.",1248739200,16,1481,4.548872180451128
3829417,5,B001Y44EBW,"I loved this film.  Normally I say 'movie' but this truly is a masterpiece film.  It is about a happily married older couple.  The wife finds out that the husband is dying (no spoiler here, it's on the box) and she ends up not telling him, trying to hold on to their normal routine and to visit their (selfish) children.  Well, she ends up dying and he finally starts to really consider her, his wife.  He wants to be closer to her, and to answer an important question...where is she now?  While the film doesn't go into God and so forth, it reaches toward traditional Japanese beliefs, dance, expression...and Mt. Fuji.

Be sure to watch this when you have stillness in your home.  It's first viewing is to be savored, even if you have to put off watching it for a few days.  I watched it on Netflix instant..with my kids hollering in the background (I used a headset and watched it on my p.c.) and jumping around while they played Wii.  Well, I wish I had watched it in my living room, with a glass of wine, my husband and the flatscreen!!  This movie takes you there, to the feelings of this wife, then of this man.  I couldn't help but think more couples should watch this, to avoid the feelings of 'too little too late'.  I know my hubby and I plan to travel some day, I hope we make it :)

Watch this movie, it's a beautiful film with layers that you peel away slowly as you watch and long afterward.",1246924800,9,1406,4.276515151515151
3829418,5,B001Y44EBW,"As a poet, I was so moved by this film I could hardly breathe.  This is what cinema as art is all about--catharsis.  I am quite surprised other reviewers have not mentioned the quintessential role of the young woman playing the mysterious Japanese dancer, for she is the real center of the story.  There are so many other things I could say, but I am still ""in the movie"" as it were.  Simply A GREAT WORK OF ART!",1246579200,12,412,4.243589743589744
3829419,5,B001Y44EBW,"""Cherry Blossoms,"" directed by Doris Dorrie, is quite simply, the most exquisitely beautiful and wise film I have ever experienced.  It surprised me, going in directions I had not forseen, with a freshness and fierceness of love that is as provocative as it is deeply moving.  You traverse with the main character, a man who has lived a safely routine, dull life and live with him a transformative, spiritual journey that is beyond the usual cliches, so often played in Hollywood movies.  It is simultaneously raw and subtle in it's vision of the true wonder of life and the possibility of really opening to the depths of being.  I don't want to give away any of the plot and I would emphasize not even reading the back jacket of the DVD package, nor any reviews that give away any of the plot.  I, unfortunately, was not so lucky and the spoilers that are written alter one's experience of it.  Better not to know anything of the plot.  Yet even if one does read the plot beforehand, it is still an amazing, soul touching experience.  This film was life altering for me and helped me in my own inner work and feeling about life, itself.  ""Cherry Blossoms"" has been a blessing, and I have deep gratitude toward the director, who has obviously tapped into life's deepest, nurturing wells and underground springs.",1243123200,69,1311,4.665217391304348

3829435,5,B001Y44EBW,"This movie to me was and is amazing. I saw it (rented it) and then bought it so I could watch it over several times. I read a negative review of it (by a professional critic I think) who said the first part was good, well made, but the 2nd part was not. This person missed the whole point.  First she gave the twist in the story so anyone reading the critique would not have this surprise and then she missed a lot of the undertones in the 2nd part. For instance she said ""he meets a young girl who happens to be a butoh dancer and that happens to be what his wife wanted to be"". That says it all, how the person misunderstood the whole story.  In fact the person goes to Japan to find the answer to the death  he cannot accept and in the first part we see his wife at a butoh performance in Berlin, the two parts of the movie tie in exactly. Also there is a clear analysis or how people view and deal with death in the east and the west. The young girl (the butoh dancer in Tokyo) has lost her mother and there is a poignant scene where she compares her mother to a duck (!! up and down, up and down) and gives a very sharp clue as to her mother's death. Also she has been rendered homeless from this death, her situation is quite desperate but in fact she deals with death so much better than our character who is trying to understand his loss from a western point of view.  This movie was a seminal event for me, maybe because I have had some losses in my family and am a dancer but it provoked a terrific surge of creativity , This movie also made me very happy in many ways..and it's beautiful.

3829437,5,B001Y44EBW,"One of the most accomplished, beautiful, transcendent movies I've seen in the last decade:  a German family's relationship to Japan.  It hovers delicately around the central spiritual meanings of both Buddhism and Christianity, without mentioning either.  Cherry Blossoms is about love, love between husband and wife, between the West and East.  A movie about tolerance and forgiveness too.
The director Doris Dorrie has traversed this territory before somewhat in her previous movie ""Enlightenment Guaranteed"".
I believe in life after death, and this movie celebrates that belief with great sublimity and joy.
Dancing too is a core element in the structure of the story.  In addition, Dorrie has chosen the way to a music soundtrack which again melds the East and West, using little known sources such as the exquisite Japanese acoustic group of Shunsuke Mizuno.

The opening scenes in the sweet little Bavarian village are wonderful.  Then...Tokyo, which is mostly frightening...and finally Mt. Fuji, which is as lovely as anyone could imagine.

The story is wonderful.  It centers on a very ordinary, middle aged man who likes to do everything the same way, every day and his wife who would love to visit Japan but never does.  The family dynamics are at times hard to watch but they are unfortunately quite realistic.  The film shows the ordinariness of these well ordered, sensible, middle class German people and the extraordinary magical loveliness of a young girl who dances in the park during the day, in full costume, and who sleeps in a tent at night.  The girl gives the man the love and kindness and understanding that his children don't.

The cast is perfect.  The man, who is not the type to show his feelings, nonetheless is very moving.  The wife is quite beautiful, even in her older years.  The young Japanese dancer will win your heart...she is extraordinary.

It's hard to describe the emotional impact that this film has.  I found it amazing...not just  by showing the depth of sorrow and grief of life but also the incredible beauty that it holds.

3829441,3,B001Y44EBW,"At the core of `Cherry Blossoms' is a sincere portrait of loss and the desire to reconnect with loved ones we feel as though we've never truly connected with.  It's hard to describe this film without giving away a very key plot point that is heavily disguised in the product description, so I'm struggling with how to really review this film.  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, so being vague is the name of the game, which is hard for me.

This is going to be a short review, apparently.

`Cherry Blossoms' tells the story of an elderly couple who are trying, on the outset of the film, to connect with their scattered children.  Trudi has learned some health news supposedly regarding her husband and so, without a word on the subject, she persuades him to visit their three children.  It is apparent that their children don't have time for them, don't want to make time for them and quite frankly don't like spending time with them.  Then something tragic happens and the film attempts to depict loss in a unique way.  I feel like I can't say much more on the subject.

As much as I respect some of the choices made here, and as much as I really adore the performance by Elmar Wepper, I found too many nagging details here that make this fall short in my eyes.  The depiction of the children in particular is beyond off-putting.  They are all ungrateful, spoiled, selfish, heartless brats and I can't fathom how they got to where they are.  I never in my life wanted to smack so many people, and for pointless and rather stupid things.  The relationship that forms between Rudi and a street performer is strange and doesn't really add to the weight of the film's themes.  It actually takes away from them because it is, in a sense, distracting, especially once he starts getting personally invested with her and her situation.  It took away from what the film should have been about.

Alas, it has its moments and Wepper really is sensational (he reminds me in a way of Tom Wilkinson), but the film gets derailed in the second half, right when it should have been building a stronger investment.",1344988800,3,2107,4.549071618037135
3829442,5,B001Y44EBW,"Oh my goodness what a wonderful story about life, love and loss.

The children can barely stand to be around their elderly parents or have time for them. Only the daughter's female lover seems interested in them at all. They then go on to the sea where the elderly wife sadly dies in her sleep. The grief stricken husband Rudi decides to go and visit his third adult child in Japan, a place his wife had longed to visit. He stays in Tokyo with his semi-alcoholic, workaholic son who has no time or patience for his father either and can't wait for him to leave. Seeking distraction from his grief Rudi meets an 18 year old street performer, Butoh dancer named Yu in a cherry blossom filled park when he explores Tokyo. He strikes up a poetical and poignant relationship with her. Yu is working on her own grief issues after her mother's death a year before. She is the only person in the movie who truly has time for and understanding of Rudi.  This movie has a lot of emotional depth and is definitely melancholy and sentimental as it touches on mourning and regret. Hidden in this movie there are also moments of joyfulness and a lot of exploration of what it means to truly touch and be touched by another person. The pacing is slow like Butoh dancing itself and the movie slowly opens like the vulnerable petal of a perfect cherry blossom. This is now one of my new, favorite Japanese movies even though it is actually a German movie.  I loved it and I recommend it for those wanting to go on a soul searching journey that may leave you in tears in parts especially if you have suffered profound losses in your own life. Everything in life is about impermanence and this movie is a lesson in seeking out the elegant even in the mundane and embracing life. The acting is spot on and the cinematography wonderful. 5 Stars!!!",1341532800,6,2015,4.437837837837838
3829443,5,B001Y44EBW,"Seems one viewer thought this would be an action movie (LOL)... Uh-huh... Cherry Blossoms is maybe the title of a kung-fu flick? (LMAO). No!

  It is a loving and systematic look at the dynamics of a family of five, what they mean to each other, and the harvest of their individual life choices. The parents are an elderly couple with three grown kids - one girl and two boys. The couple is so close, they are separated by just one letter (i.e. Rudi and Trudi). They live very simply in an alpine area of Bavaria where he is a waste management official, while his wife is the doting hausfrau. Her favorite son, Karl (""Karli""), is a financier who lives in Tokyo. The other two live in Berlin.

  When the film opens, Trudi is told by the doctors that her husband has terminal cancer. She decides not to tell him, preferring instead to take him out of his routine and visit the kids, and go for a vacation at the Baltic seaside. She is adventurous and has an inquisitive mind, while he is cocooned in his predictably routine life. They live in a chalet with gingerbread staircase and antlers on the wall. While at the beach he tells her he wants to go back home. He cannot understand her fascination with Japan or the strange dance form called Butoh (the shadow dance of the soul). Unexpectedly, she dies at the beach [don't worry, this film is about the soul, not plot].

  The kids and the daughter's female lover meet their dad at the beach and remember Trudi. Interestingly the parents have expressed that they no longer know their kids, and vice versa. It turns out that the girl's lover ""gets"" Rudi, unlike his kids, spending a lot of time showing him around Berlin.

  After visiting the kids one last time in Berlin, Rudi takes out all his money and goes to visit his uptight, stressed out son Karl in Tokyo, a jolting contrast to the bucolic surroundings of rural Bavaria. And there the life-changing events begin, as he meets an 18 year old homeless girl who dances Butoh in the park amid the cherry blossoms. The film becomes more beautiful with every subsequent viewing, and has a warmth we don't usually associate with Germans. Gorgeous photography, lovely music and superb actors. One of my top ten of all time. An absolute masterpiece.

WARNING: Not for action film buffs (LMAO).",1327190400,8,2292,4.588235294117647
3829444,5,B001Y44EBW,"I loved the story, the acting, the cinematography... everything, except, the subtitles... they were difficult to read (yellow) and when the characters switched to English (the common tongue between the Japanese girl and the German man for the last part of the movie), they didn't show at all... which as a hearing impaired viewer made it difficult to understand as they both spoke English with their respective accents!  I had to rewind and replay multiple times to catch what was said...
But still, I loved the movie and recommend it, just want other buyers to be aware of potential difficulties if they are hard of hearing or have difficulty with subtitled movies to begin with.",1322611200,3,680,4.913043478260869
3829445,5,B001Y44EBW,The patience and love exhibited by this film are rare.  Profound on the subject of intimacy and understanding in a middle aged married couple.  The story takes us on the journey of the survivor after the death of his spouse and his search to understand her.  It accents the essential aloneness of each person even in a loving relationship. Like a Butoh concert every expression and image occurs slowly at the proper pace.  A clear masterpiece of humanity and film making that also gives a fleeting introduction to Butoh.,1289865600,5,520,4.808988764044944
3829446,5,B001Y44EBW,"I don't really want to spoil the film by revealing the plot, so I just want to say what I saw and felt in this film, which, to me, is the sublime in subtle films.

I've hardly given 5 stars with my reviews but this time I will, because this is an absolutely beautiful film, and one of the best European (German) films I've ever seen, but also one of the saddest films too. I really can't find the right words to describe it, but this film definitely left me something huge in my chest, and every time I think of this film I feel some tightness in it, and I have to take a few sighs to ease it.

Five best words that might describe this film for me are: love, sadness, agony, beauty... and Japan. If you like any of these elements in films and are a fan of European films, I can certainly recomment this film to you! It will appeal to emotion and to reason.

Hope this helps,",1272240000,6,874,4.069767441860465
3829447,4,B001Y44EBW,"As the story opens, we meet Rudi and Trudi, an older couple living in Bavaria.  Rudy is stoic and undemonstrative, content to go to his dull job everyday while Trudi harbors a secret wish to see Japan, yet they are as close as two cabbage rolls on a plate.  When she learns that he is dying, she arranges a trip to visit their children, but the kids are too busy to be bothered with them.

This is a remarkable film about life and death and devotion.  It moves slowly and gently and allows us to get to know the couple and their self-absorbed children.  It deals with love and fulfilling one's dream and gave me a lot to think about.  The story goes from Germany to Japan and is in German with English subtitles and much spoken English in the second half.

The DVD cover calls this movie, ""sublime,"" and I agree.  If you've experienced love and loss, this movie will touch you deeply.  Highly recommended.",1269993600,3,905,4.403614457831325
3829448,5,B001Y44EBW,"Cherry Blossoms (2008) film by Doris Dorrie is a beautiful film, but can be painful to watch.  But to feel pain or any extreme emotion, then the director has done her job.  At over 2 hours, it didn't feel it unusually lengthy, because one becomes engrossed in the telling of a man so tormented by guilt over his wife's death.  The story takes place in Germany, but for the latter part, the setting is Japan, with beautiful scenery, especially the cherry blossom trees.

It begins where a woman discovers her husband has a terminal illness and she encourages a visit to be with their children, two who live in Germany, and one in Tokyo.  And immediately upon their arrival, we learn how disconnected they are to the children who don't go out of their way for them.  You can feel this tension, discomfort, unsettling atmosphere.  Suprisingly, it is the wife who has departed this world.  Her husband learns how she had desires, dreams, and a passion for Japan and Butoh dancing, dancing in white body makeup, slow movements, playful or grotesque imagery.

What follows after this death is the sad part, how an elderly man has succumbed to abnormalities in grief or dealing with guilt.  It is painful to watch the odd behavior, the lonliness, coldness from family, the indignities, but beautiful to see how his quest evolves, and a endearing friendship with a street performer.

Casing Elmar Wepper as Rudi was a brilliant move.  How much can you read on this man's face, the body language. His acting was wonderful, so very real.

Doris Dorrie is one of Germany's important female directors.  I would encourage one to see two brothers journey in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enlightenment-Guaranteed/dp/B00006JL2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enlightenment Guaranteed</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Am-I-Beautiful/dp/B0002JC5RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Am I Beautiful?</a>.

3829449,5,B001Y44EBW,"When her husband is diagnosed with a terminal illness, a German woman named Trudi decides it's time the both of them paid a long overdue visit to their adult children - two of whom live in Berlin and one in Japan.  The catch is that the husband, Rudi, doesn't even know he's sick and neither do the kids.  Thus, Trudi must live with this horrible secret while putting on a brave face for those around her.  But then a different, wholly unforeseen tragedy strikes the family and the movie heads off into an entirely new and utterly unanticipated direction from where we thought it was going.

A German movie set largely in Japan, ""Cherry Blossoms"" is a beautiful and heartbreaking film about living for the moment and of not putting off till tomorrow what you can do today.  It's also marvelously perceptive about the dynamics of parent/child relationships, especially when, as is true in this case, the parents are viewed by their self-absorbed offspring more as burdens to be endured than blessings to be cherished.  The irony is that Rudi and Trudi have more in common with - and indeed are treated better by - many of the strangers and casual acquaintances they come in contact with than they are by their own children.

But the movie is also an examination of marriage and of how partners can become so entwined with one another as a couple that they lose their identities as individuals, missing out on the dreams and goals they had for their lives when they were still young and unattached.  This is certainly the case for Trudi, who has harbored a lifelong desire to take up Japanese dancing, a desire that Rudi, in his selfish indifference, has pretty much squelched in her for the duration of their marriage.  Such a realization of lost opportunities can lead to regrets, recriminations and despair at the end of the road, yet in the case of Rudi and Trudi, one learns that lesson a little too late - and the other just in the nick of time.

Elmer Wepper and Hannelore Elsner are magnificent as the aged couple, superbly capturing the deep-seated but often unspoken love that each spouse has for the other.  A fine supporting cast, led by Maximilian Bruckner as one of their sons and Aya Irizuki as a young street artist who befriends Rudi in his time of greatest need, adds to the movie`s richness.  Another crucial element in the emotional force of the movie is the richly elegiac score by Claus Bantzer.

The glory of this exquisitely realized and profoundly moving film is its willingness to grapple with some truly major issues - of life and death, of sorrow and loss, of filial and marital relationships - without getting heavy-handed and preachy about it in the process.  Every moment in this film feels real and unforced, yet the movie itself has the minutely worked-out grace and precision of Japanese performance art (which we see quite a bit of throughout the course of the film).  In fact, near the end, there is a fantasy dance sequence that is, quite frankly, one of the most utterly spellbinding and breathtaking scenes I`ve come across in ages.

Masterfully directed by Doris Dorrie, ""Cherry Blossoms"" is a lyrical and unforgettable work that takes its place among the truly outstanding films of recent times.",1258848000,57,3234,4.737967914438503
