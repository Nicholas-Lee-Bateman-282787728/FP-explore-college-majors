Back of tape says: Learn to create elegant, festive and cleverly decorated cakes with the help of our simple instructions and video demonstration. This 40 minute video features sections on Children's cakes, Holiday cakes, Cakes for the family, and Special Occasion cakes. After a brief review of the proper way to frost a cake we'll show you....
how to turn cakes into different shapes, and use garnishes like gumdrops in creative ways.

Also includes instructions on how to use a pastry bag and tinted frosting. Hmm, maybe I should watch this tape after all.",1195862400,,748,4.574626865671642
