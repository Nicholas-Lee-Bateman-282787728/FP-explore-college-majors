8511954,5,B0077NTZTA,"This Is My Alaska (1969) documentary by Alaska hunter guide Leroy Shebal made outside the Hollywood/ NYC media system by a loner of great talent.

This documentary movie about Alaska was released in 1969, and worked personally with its creator, Leroy Shebal, to publicize the movie in San Francisco Bay, California area movie houses.

I was a regional (SF CA USA) movie publicist in 1969 and created a local publicity tour of San Francisco California area newspaper writers, local TV and radio talk shows, and private publicity screenings to promote then new This Is My Alaska (1969) filmed in 16 mm color movie film and blown up into a 35 mm print version and shown all over the USA in major cities and movie markets by the man who made the movie, a go-getter Alaska based master hunter quite of fame, Leroy Shebal.

I spent three days with Mr. Shebal, and provide memories below of him and promotion of his movie.

The movie itself is/ was an interesting if rough around the edges look at rural Alaska, the hunting of White Dall Sheep there, and provided wonderful scenery of wide open spaces and mountain hunting areas in 1960's Alaska.

Leroy ""Buster"" Shebal's 16 mm movie footage was made into a feature length movie documentary, and Leroy Shebal contracted with local movie house owners all over the USA in 1969 to show it, and also paid to have the movie publicized in San Francisco, California, and probably in other major USA cities.

Below is information of interest about all that I share with all interested in This Is My Alaska (1969), a movie all interested in Alaska should obtain (still sold on Amazon. Com) and screen often. It's rough and not smooth, but that's true about Alaska, and perhaps, that's the first lesson all who consider Alaska must learn...the most important lesson!

Leroy Shebal died in 2003 at age 79.

I met him in 1969 in San Francisco California when he was 45 years old, and I was then a 25 year old movie publicist working for the Jack Wodell Associates Movie Public Relations And Advertising Company located then at 582 Market St. (corner of Montgomery St.), San Francisco.

Shebal was then touring the USA and promoting his documentary movie (now available for purchase from Amazon. Com) titled THIS IS MY ALASKA (1969).

He hired SF CA Bay area movie publicity from Jack Wodell Agency, and I was assigned to create and accompany him on a personal publicity tour lasting about 3 days in which he was interviewed by SF CA area newspaper movie writers and reviewers, local TV talk show and radio personalities.....

I also set up a private screening of THIS IS MY ALASKA (1969) for SF CA area major movie reviewers (about 5 reviewers), and as second screening for small newspaper movie reviewers (about 40 reviewers).

I'll always remember Mr. Shebal.

The agency I worked for was mostly hired by major Hollywood movie studios which sent movie stars and other celebrities to SF CA for regional movie publicity tours and paid a lot of money to keep them happy and promote the movies they were part of properly.

This always included money paid to the best SF CA hotels and restaurants, limousine hiring, sometimes call girls hired to service weary traveling male movie stars and others....all paid for back then by corporate movie studio people.

Most movie publicity tours the Wodell Agency handled were very elegant and expensive.

Leroy Shebal engaged the Wodell Agency (and my services as an employee publicist there in 1969) without realizing the big time company he became part of.

He did his publicity tour on a budget, used a rented car he drove himself rather than a hired limousine to go from publicity location to publicity location (radio stations, TV stations, newspaper offices, the SF private screening room then located in the ""Film Row"" area of SF CA).

He was a pleasant but rough around the edges person with a ""wilderness personality"" I remember well and admired....for him, the entire SF CA movie publicity tour and the TV and radio stations and newspaper locations he visited were unusual and exotic, certainly as much as places he photographed in Alaska and guided hunters into.

He was very rugged and fit looking, but wore eyeglasses as did his wife, Vivian (not part of the tour, didn't accompany him, but seen in the THIS IS MY ALASKA [1969] movie as his ""co-star.""

That was 45 years ago, and I write this in 2012 at age 68.

I researched his name in Google. Com and came up with his 2003 Obituary from a major San Diego/ Southern California newspaper, the NORTH COUNTY NEWS.

""Leroy 'Buster' Shebal :

Leroy ""Buster"" Shebal, 79, passed away on Sunday, September 14, 2003, while visiting Seward, Alaska, with his wife, Jane. ""He suffered a heart attack.

""The movies Leroy took on hunting and fishing trips were eventually turned into a full length feature film that was shown in theaters across the United States. It was later released in VHS format under the title ""This Is My Alaska.""
