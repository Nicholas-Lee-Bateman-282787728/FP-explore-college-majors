5391178,3,B00A703PZU,"This is a movie with an unusual plot about a Korean team to reach an antartic checkpoint.
The plot is generally good, but hard to understand, with Korean dialect and English subtitles which leaves me to mind of reading directions on oriental manufactured items.
The movie ends in almost complete darkness, and left me wondering what happened.",1374710400,,342,5.017543859649122
5391179,4,B00A703PZU,"This movie was pretty good.  It is about a team of 6 Korean explorers going to the Point Of Inaccessibility in Antarctica. One question I had through the movie, if it is so inaccessible why is there so much debris from previous groups in the area?  I can understand the debris from the British expedition but why the fishing camp or whatever it was?  Also why the marker over the spot of the POI?  How many expeditions had already been there?  I did like that you never were sure what was reality and what was the past seeping through.  And that the Koreans were never able to really deviate from the trail of the British.  I did wonder how they went from having only 1 week worth of food to having enough for 3.  Overall it was a good movie and I do recommend it.",1374105600,4,764,4.220689655172414
5391180,4,B00A703PZU,I liked Antartic Journal. The movie is a very creepy and suspenseful Korean horror flick. Six Korean explores go on an expediition in Antartica. But the team finds a journal and a dead body from a British expedition back in 1922. And things just get creepier from there for the team of explores.,1373414400,3,295,4.584905660377358

8547343,2,B00A703PZU,I watched the whole thing and it was a bit of a chore.  The beginning was compelling but the pacing never felt right and the payoff was not worth the time.  I confess I am not sure what this is supposed to be and much may have been lost in the translation but it seemed pointless to me.,1451865600,,286,3.913793103448276

8547345,3,B00A703PZU,This movie had the potential to be great.  The first half was just awesome.  Some of the best actions scenes I have ever seen in a movie.  I was so bored by the end I was struggling to finish it.  The second half was senseless.  I wish they could re-release it with a different second half.,1419465600,,290,4.107142857142857

8547348,2,B00A703PZU,"I don't quite know what to say about this film.

I don't read other reviews and have no desire to dissect the film. I review these things to let you know whether you might like the film m,or not, not to be erudite.

Maybe a Korean audience would know what this was about, but I have no freaking idea. It didn't know what it wanted to be: adventure, man against the odds, ghost film or what. It was surreal and over the top as six men try to march to some fictitious point called the P.O.I. I mean---they could have just choppered there, so it's a phony expedition to begin with. And when they start dying one by one, I mean, like, it's time to use the sat-link to call in the rescue party, like Bear and Les' do on TV.

But the ""captain"" keeps driving his men onward into death, and they follow, against all reason and intelligence. Maybe this fictitious point at the Antarctic requires some special ""bushido"" from men, not just flying down to it, I don't know. But something special is supposed to happen when they get there.

I did not get the plot; I did not get the ending; I was not interested or entertained. I feel I wasted my time and could have been watching a good Bollywood comedy or a Jap/Chinese period piece.

Korean film is not good at this sort of story. It was more Jap/Chinese. Koreans are great at comedy, period pieces, and mobster stuff, but this was just too philosophical and obscure for me to enjoy or be innerested in---I mean, I don't want to work THAT hard to get the point.

Also, the cgi (men plodding across trackless wasteland) and green screen (dark skies, caverns, etc.) stuff didn't work for me and was just irritating.

Give it a miss, is what I advise :)

Sorry.

8547349,4,B00A703PZU,"It was okay, although I doubt realistically anyone would allow themselves to be led to their destruction by someone as obviously disturbed as their leader.  The acting and graphics in this movie were good.  It also managed to hold my interest from beginning to end.",1377302400,2,265,4.866666666666666
8547350,4,B00A703PZU,"I have a fondness for horror set in the Antarctic.  And this is about as atmospheric as it gets, you can feel the cold. The plot is as little obscure but there is a constant feeling of dread that keeps the viewer hooked till the very end. The subtitles are not well done but that is not a serious flaw in a film like this.",1376092800,2,322,3.953846153846154
