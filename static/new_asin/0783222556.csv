In fact, I might even recommend it for that--cheap entertainment at a birthday party or similar for an hour--but as an overall movie, just keep moving.  I'll give it two stars for the ""kid"" factor.",1500076800,,297,4.803921568627451

7790119,5,0783222556,"This is one of the best Buck Jones oaters that I've ever seen. I've seen many of his movies because he is one of my favorite B-Western stars (he and silver of course). What makes this one of his best is a unique story, fantastic action scenes, and some really great acting. In my opinion this was Bucks peak period (1935) at Universal studios. The quality of the Black and White film on this video is fantastic and what a treat to see the old newsreels of the day and a chapter from Bucks chapter serial 'Gordon of Ghost City"" all before the movie starts. If you are a fan of B-Westerns like I am this should be a ""must"" in your collection. Buck also produced this one and did an exceptional job indeed. I'm surprised the Westerns Channel has never shown this one. Simply a B-Western classic.",1081728000,6,792,4.358108108108108
