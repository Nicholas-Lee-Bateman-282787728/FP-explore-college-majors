8158448,4,B000087F3S,The cinematography in the beginning was awesome.  This is a violent graphic film.  18 and over if you ask me.,1377216000,,109,4.4
8158449,4,B000087F3S,"This Korean film is one of these reasons their cinema has been one to watch lately. A very gripping tale of mutiny on a secret Korean sub and the one man out who must stop the whole rest of the crew from starting a world war. No, its not ""Die-hard on a submarine"" as some wags would probably put it. The style is fresh and frenzied, with plenty of meat here for both art film fans and action buffs. Despite a bit of a truncated length-it easily could have been a bit longer to pull out some of the tension, it comes highly recommended from me.",1077494400,7,543,4.132075471698113
8158450,4,B000087F3S,"I am a bit surprised to see the movie in Chinese section since it is a Korean movie.  It is filled with conspiracy and lots of suspense.  Not all the facts in the movie are similar with the real situation in Korean NAVY.  However, it makes you aware of the history of Korea and its position in Asia.
I might say the conspiracy is too much, but overall its a good movie to see a sub do awesome things under the sea.
This movie reminded me of Hunt for Red October.
Unlike the movie, this one is a bit more gruesome.  If it is uncensored version, there are going to be couple of scenes that could be a bit gruesome.",1063670400,10,612,4.075
