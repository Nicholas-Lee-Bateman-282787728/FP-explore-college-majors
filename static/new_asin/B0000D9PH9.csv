For any Yu-Gi-Oh! fan they love to see Yugi and Joey lose there cool and still the outcome is Yugi Joey win there matchs. Its also a good dvd because it shows two friends (Yugi & Joey)duel for everything.",1067212800,3,305,4.368421052631579

8000205,5,B0000D9PH9,"This set contains volumes 11-13 of Season One (Best of Friends Best of Duelists, Match of the Millennium part 1 and Match of the Millennium part 2) and comes in a nice labled green box case that lists the episodes each volume contains. Perfect gift for any Yu-Gi-oh! Fan!",1333929600,4,271,4.551020408163265
8000206,5,B0000D9PH9,"First thing that I have said is that it sickens me that 4kids sold this thing with a MSRP of $50 that is $5 per episode were now of about $10-15 is about $1 to $1.50 an episode a way better deal. Now on to the stuff it comes with 2 mini CDs with a total of half the songs on that yugioh music to duel by album but enstead of putting the best song like your move and i'm back they put the worst songs on them but the face-up face-down song is the only good one and all the songs would be bad if it were not for the connection with yugioh. The episodes are great with joey v keith, yugi v joey, and yugi v maximillion especialy if you're buying them now and you didn't back in 2003 for the full overprice.",1314144000,,703,3.8551724137931034
8000207,2,B0000D9PH9,This set is to be ignored.  Anyone who wants to own the full 1st season of Yu-gi-oh needs only to buy the Season 1 set.  It sells for almost $90.00 at most retailers but is the only good choice for owning the series.  This Volume 11-13 set shouldn't even be purchased by those who have all of the other single volumes up to this one.  The best way to go would be to sell the single volumes and purchase the all-inclusive season 1 box.  Mine came with a metal collectors tin.  Happy hunting.,1106956800,4,490,4.21505376344086
8000208,1,B0000D9PH9,"what you gotta be kidding me this is so stupid you only get volume 11 12 and 13 you only get 10 episodes ...boring... i think they did this so stupid they should of have a whole season and at a reasonable price not rip you off like this i for one think this is boring. the episdoes you get are keiths machination parts 1-2, best of friends best of duelist parts 1-2, yugi vs pegasus- match of the millennium parts 1-5, and aftermath thats not worth getting i think you would too.",1098921600,,479,4.161290322580645
