8374654,5,B002N5KE10,"My first introduction to these concerts was from a DVD titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coleman-Hawkins-Harry-Edison-Quintet-London-Concert-1964/dp/B000FJI4FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coleman Hawkins/Harry Edison Quintet: London Concert 1964</a>. That video contained what must be a different night from the 1964 concerts in London, as well as a different night for the 1962 Belgium concert. While I was thrilled to get that DVD the audio and video were poor. This DVD does not share those flaws. Moreover, the concerts on this one are twice as long and contain different songs.

The first segment on this DVD is from June, 1962 in Brussels. The set list is: Disorder At The Border, Autumn Leaves, Lover Come Back To Me, Moonlight In Vermont, All The Things You Are and Ow! These were performed with Coleman on tenor, Jimmy Woode on bass, George Arvanitas on piano, and Kansas Fields on drums.

Performance on this segment are a lot more energetic than the one for the same venue that is on the other DVD I mentioned. Woode and Arvanitas took some amazing solos and were 'on' throughout the concert. The drummer, Kansas Fields, was a bit over the top in my opinion. He was an excellent drummer and if you like plenty of chops on solos and fills you will like him. I thought he could have been more subtle, but that is both a personal preference and probably influenced by how much more subtly and smoothly the great drummer, Papa Jo Jones, played in the next segment.

About the second segment: it was shot at Wembley Town Hall in London in October 1964. This concert was in conjunction with the BBC's Jazz 625 series with excellent video but a slight echo in the audio. I am unsure as to why the audio is the way it is because one would have thought that it would have been cleaned up or processed for television broadcast. Perhaps it was a raw feed. Regardless, it is not a show stopper for me and actually sounds like an echo is a concert hall without sound baffling if attending a live concert (which this was).

The ensemble for this segment are some of the pioneers of jazz. That, alone, makes this segment worth the price of the DVD. We have Coleman Hawkins who made the saxophone a jazz instrument instead of a novelty, Harry Edison who influenced generations of trumpeters, and Papa Jo Jones who redefined swing drumming, as well as giving us vocabularies for both brushes and hi-hats. The other musicians were from the next generation, including Jimmy Woode on bass and Sir Charles Thompson on piano (Thompson actually was from Edison's generation, but spent a lot of his career in smaller ensembles which did not get him the recognition that he deserved.)

Songs performed are Disorder At The Border, a medley consisting of Lover Man/Stella By Starlight/Girl From Ipanema,  What Is This Thing Called Love, Stoned, another medley consisting of September Song/What's New/Willow Weep For Me, Centerpiece and Caravan.

Other reviewers here have described the songs and individuals - especially Sweets Edison - far better than I could so I will not attempt to add comments that are only going to repeat them. I will invite you to compare Papa Jo Jones on drums on this segment to Kansas Fields on the Brussels one. Not to disparage Fields, but to soak in a true master who used tasteful chops and subtle (but amazing) playing to call attention to the soloists instead of himself. Even when he takes his jaw dropping solo on Caravan it's a masterpiece in both rhythm and taste.

This DVD has historical value solely because of Hawkins, but that value is greatly increased by Edison and Papa Jo Jones who also pioneered the music and added to its evolution. And, of course, this DVD has outstanding entertainment value as well with 140 minutes of superb jazz.",1342310400,2,3814,4.920684292379471
8374655,5,B002N5KE10,"I hesitated getting this one because the dates and locations matched another Coleman Hawkins DVD that I reviewed. Of course, having other shoppers review products really helps. The reviewer that commented about Harry Sweets Edidson stealing the show on Girl From Ipamema, that told me these weren't the same concerts. This one was really great. Sure they are in B&W, but so what, the quality is high for 1962 & 1964, these great pioneers performance is top notch, I count myself lucky to witness these legends in action. Thank you Jazz Icons, again.",1279238400,4,549,4.913978494623656
8374656,5,B002N5KE10,"I have 18 of the Jazz Icons series and Hawkins is one of the best. But that's to say because they are all fantastic. It's unbelievable what you get for well under $20: an hour plus of American classical music (great sound) and a multi-page booklet with photos, history and liner notes. If you love jazz, you can not afford not to check these out.",1267660800,4,346,4.338461538461538
8374657,4,B002N5KE10,"The father of Jazz saxophone, COLEMAN HAWKINS, gets deluxe due with a whopping 2 hours 20 minutes of bop chops.

This disc unleashes two great shows with different bands from tours of Europe. His drummer on the first concert, Kansas Fields, puts sway into martial precision while Coleman puts the mellow in melodic. Hawkins is in fine form here, showing us why he earned his crown as the master of jazz improvisation. Parisian pianist Georges Arvanitas is an excellent foil with his modern and sometimes risky chordings thrown off with easy aplomb.

The second show with a new line-up finds Hawkins pacing himself in a slow burn. With his almost sad dignity trumpeter Harry ""Sweets"" Edison nearly steals the show from his friend; he especially stands out on his unexpected ballad choice, ""The Girl From Ipanema"". Hawkins is back in the groove before long and abbetted greatly by bassist Jimmy Woode and the great drummer ""Papa"" Jo Jones. This man put saxophone on the map and on this great collection he shows us how.",1261094400,8,1017,4.839080459770115
