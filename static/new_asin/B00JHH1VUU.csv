There aren't a lot of extras.  You won't find cast commentary, the making of ""Newhart"", or subtitles in several languages.  What you will find is the best comedy show produced at a time when there were several candidates for that title.  So pull up a chair and enjoy an evening at the Stratford.  You'll be glad you did.",1404345600,39,498,4.455555555555556

6357996,4,B00JHH1VUU,"The fourth season follows Dick (Bob Newhart) and Joanna Loudon (Mary Frann) further into their adventures at their colonial Vermont inn, as well as Dick's weekly program at the local TV station.

Self-centered, often ditzy maid Stephanie (Julia Duffy) is still going strong with TV station manager Michael (Peter Scolari). They do have their ups and downs, as when Michael finally stands up to her demanding ways in ""The Way We Ought to Be"" or when Stephanie reads his secret diary in ""Write to Privacy.""

The hilariously bizarre trio of brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl (William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss and John Voldstad) is also up to their usual hijinks - in ""Summa Cum Larry,"" Larry decides to go back to school for his GED but doesn't want his brothers to find out. In ""Candidate Larry,"" Larry run for mayor and can't understand why someone might not want to back him.

And of course, there's the usual array of eccentric and wacky townspeople and guests at the inn -- usually coming by just as Dick is busiest with his latest writing project.

Viewers young and old will enjoy this classic sitcom!",1452729600,,1106,4.8052631578947365

6358061,5,B00JHH1VUU,"It took them three seasons, but they finally found the perfect mix of fun for Bob Newharts second sitcom.  How can you tell?  Because season four of Newhart is the first season of the show that didn't include a cast change for one of the main characters or even the supporting cast.  And the writers were able to build on the fun of the previous season and create even more laughs.  As fun as season three is, this season is even better.

For those who have missed this wonderful comedy, Bob Newhart stars as Dick Loudon, a how-to writer who, along with his wife Joanna (Mary Frann), runs a bed and breakfast in Vermont.  They run it on a small staff made up of handyman George Utley (Tom Poston) and maid Stephanie Vanderkellen (Julia Duffy).  Rounding out the main cast is Michael Harris (Peter Scolari), the shallow yuppie producer of Dicks local TV show.  Michael is also dating Stephanie, who just happens to be an heiress who was cut off by her family and forced to work as a maid, not that shes very good at it.  (Shes sense reconciled with her family, but shes kept her job.)

Of course, those are the main characters.  The show is filled with a great collection of recurring characters  villagers and co-workers at the TV station.  However, the most famous would be Larry (William Sanderson), his brother Darryl (Tony Papenfuss), and his other brother Darryl (John Voldstad).  This trio of backwoodsmen run the caf next door to the Loudons inn and pop in quite regularly.  They even get some of their own storylines.  These were fan favorite characters, and they are always so funny.

So just what do these characters deal with over the course of the season?  When Dick tells Michael to stand up to Stephanie, the results spill over onto his TV show.  Joanna and Stephanie open an aerobic studio and the resulting power struggle spills over back to the inn.  George quits his lodge, The Beavers, and tries to set up his own.  Larry goes back to get his GED, leaving Dick to explain his nightly absences to Darryl.  The inn suddenly appears to be haunted when strange things start happening.  An unseasonably warm February leaves the town relying on Larry, Darryl, and Darryl to save their ice carnival.  And when Dick decides to submit his latest book under an old pen name, he is surprised when it is rejected.

I was actually surprised just how many of these episodes I remembered when I sat down to watch them.  Mind you, its been years since I watch any reruns on TV, but sometimes by the second scene, I could remember exactly how an episode evolved. That shows you just how great this season truly is.  Id argue these are some of my favorite episodes ever.  The characters are perfectly developed to be funny, especially Stephanie and Michael.  They have softened some from previous seasons but aren't quite the caricatures theyd be late in the shows run.

And even though I remembered some of these stories, I still laughed hard at them.  The jokes are still funny no matter how many times youve seen an episode.  Heck, there were times even knowing the ultimate punchline of an episode didn't keep me from laughing.

The show is 30 years old, and that shows in the fashions, especially in the aerobics episode.  That one screams mid-80s, but even in the rest of the season, the hairstyles and sweaters are pretty obvious.

But that doesnt keep the show from being extremely funny.  Outside one or two jokes (like the one I used as the title of my episode), the humor is timeless since it comes from the characters and situations themselves.  Even better, it is clean.  This is the kind of show you can watch with your entire family.  Everyone will laugh and no one will be embarrassed.  What more could you want?

With no cast changes, the cast has a change to grow stronger.  There were never any bad performances in the past, and that continues here.  Everyone hits the notes perfectly for maximum comedy.  From Julia Duffys variety of Oohs to Michaels cheesy nicknames, the cast makes you believe the characters would say it.  And I will once again praise the two Darryls.  They are completely silent, and most of the time that isn't an issue since they are behind Larry, who does the talking for the group.  However, this season requires them to fly solo a couple of times, and between the writing and their acting, they are still hilarious.

Like the last two seasons, the DVD set is fairly simple.  We get all 24 episodes on three discs, and thats it.  Theres nothing in the way of extras.  The episodes themselves are in full frame and stereo, which is in keeping with their mid-80s production.  Theres nothing that will challenge your system here, but this is a show from the 80s, so it is appropriate.  The picture does have some grain and dust in it, but it is still very watchable.  I can only speak for me, but given a choice between having this season on DVD or not, I will take this set just as it is.

And frankly, I hope we get the rest of the seasons to follow soon.  Newhart was truly hitting its stride with season four.  The laughs and characters are at their peak.  Any fan of the show will be thrilled to have this set in their collection.",1434672000,7,5178,4.542207792207792

6358102,5,B00JHH1VUU,"Have been watching Newhart Vermont on cable TV. Never much cared for Bob Newhart's first series and also didn't care for the first owner of the diner next door (can't remember his name, but his wasn't funny, just mean!) Anyhow, the cast is just perfect now - Stephanie & Michael seem to get funnier and funnier with each episode. Just watched the show where Michael becomes a  Mime - so hysterical I will watch it again. Looking forward to Season 4 that my daughter bought me for my 71st birthday next week.  I googled the Stratford Inn and believe it's somewhere in Burlington, VT. Of course, just the opening scene was filmed in VT, and the show was filmed in California. Still trying to figure out where in VT that opening scene was filmed - anyone know the answer to that?  I haven't watched a sit-com in years - most of the content is vulgar, the jokes aren't funny, and none of the so-called ""newer"" sit-coms can't hold a candle to Newhart (VT)!",1429315200,,951,4.485549132947977

6358229,5,B00JHH1VUU,One of the best seasons according to Bob Newhart and I can't say he is wrong.  There are a good number of nuts for him to cure but of course he doesn't.  Well worth watching.,1416268800,,174,3.942857142857143

6358234,5,B00JHH1VUU,"I LOVE this show. I remember seeing reruns and new episodes, having been born in 1985. The show held a great place in my memories of my childhood, a place where the word ""meow"" held a special meaning.  I am so indebted to SHOUT for their efforts.

Stephanie probably inspired me in ways that the character never intended to do. However, I think this show saw a lot of the 80s and gave a lot to the 90s, in which my first memories tend to really lie.

Either way, I really hope to get the seasons of 5 to the end, so I can spend money on getting them and on them making me recall happy memories of my childhood.",1414022400,,610,4.066666666666666

I am sick and tired of watching a movie or a program that is vulgar. As for NEWHART, it was a classic and that will stay in the memories of many TV fans.

Though not until the final season, ""Newhart"" still holds the best show finale ever....though you have to be savvy to the television culture of the late 80's/early 90's to fully get it.",1412121600,,244,4.833333333333333

6358247,5,B00JHH1VUU,"I am a die hard of Bob Newhart. Starting with his 1972-78 series, the Bob Newhart Show, I have watched and enjoyed all of his subsequent series, Newhart, Bob, and George & Leo. Starting with the 3rd season, the final/regular cast was locked in after making necessary changes with the Leslie and Kirk characters. In my opinion, the series really hits its stride. The best sitcoms are written and performed whereby even the characters (Stephanie and Michael) with the thorniest quirks are beloved. The characters of Larry, Daryl & Daryl were pure comedic genius. I look forward the release of seasons 5, 6, 7, and 8.",1411948800,,614,4.80188679245283

6358265,3,B00JHH1VUU,"""Newhart"" is a great show. This is a second DVD I had to order because the first one would not play. It is not my DVR. All of my other DVD's work great except for ""Rhoda"" and  ""Newhart"", both from SHOUT. Many of the ""Newhart DVD's are like this. Sometimes they play, mostly they read ""Incorrect disc."" At least the second copy of Season 4 played the first disc, but I have yet to see discs 2 and 3 of the 4th season. I may have to send this DVD back also. I love SHOUT for bringing us these old DVD's, but if they are inconsistent and don't play, what is the purpose? I think it may be whatever colorations they are using on the DVD's.  Perhaps someone in quality control can check this out. It is disheartening to say the least.",1411344000,,729,4.126760563380282

Season four is very enjoyable, with more episodes concerning Dick's TV show, and the progress of Michael and Stephanie's romance.  George even has a fling in this season. It's so much fun to watch Newhart and be a ""guest"" at the Stratford again. I only hope they release the next seasons promptly, and don't keep us waiting too long.",1410393600,,472,4.552941176470588

6358286,5,B00JHH1VUU,"I  always loved this show, but never realized how funny it truly is as compared to what is described as comedy today. This show is hysterical, and Bob Newhart and company never fail to deliver the laughs. I also love his dry sense of humor, and this season had me laughing the entire time. It makes me long for the days when this kind of programming was the norm. Loved it, and looking forward to the release of Season 5, as the episode Goodbye and Good Riddance Mr. Chips, was hilarious, as Dick decides to take a typing class, and his teacher is none other than the same man who taught him Geography in elementary school, and he still treats him and the class as if they were all ten years old.

It is comedy at it's best!",1410307200,2,724,4.239130434782608
6358287,5,B00JHH1VUU,"I haven't seen Newhart one single time since high-school, but have fond memories of this show from my youth.  The DVD transfer is pretty fair, you'll see some artifacts from the film that were never cleaned up, but nothing that ruins the experience. Newhart is really a treasure comedy from the 80's.  I haven't seen a bad episode yet and the addition of Michael and Stephanie post season 1 really solidified this series.  Most amazingly is how relevant the shows are still today!  There are a few references from the time period, but for the most part, you could watch this today and feel like it's taking place in 2014 at an Inn in Vermont.  If you didn't grow up with this series, I'd recommend giving it a try.  They don't do comedies like this any more and hopefully you'll find yourself laughing out loud a half a dozen times a show like me!",1410307200,16,847,4.467532467532467
