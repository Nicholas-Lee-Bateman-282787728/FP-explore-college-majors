5943916,1,B00EU8RCHW,Great story but the quality  of the recording is very poor. If you can get past the tracking issues the lessons that can be taught through this story are very worth teaching your children.,1399939200,4,188,4.529411764705882
5943917,5,B00EU8RCHW,"These are our among our familiy's favorite DVD's! If you want your children to understand how Christians can walk through difficulties, yet still cling to hope in Christ Jesus. These are perfect. My children are ages 9 and 11.",1394236800,,226,4.82051282051282

5943919,5,B00EU8RCHW,We love all of the Torchlighters movies that bring the stories of courageous Christians to life. Each one is 30 minutes long and tells the pertinent details of the characters' lives in an engaging way. All of my children love them and so do their friends.,1391731200,,255,4.565217391304348
5943920,5,B00EU8RCHW,"The Torchlighters series is quickly becoming a favorite in our home.  As a Messianic Jewish family living in Jerusalem, I found the Corrie Ten Boom story to be an excellent way to teach my son about his Jewish history, and the sacrificial love of Messiah Yeshua.  The writers and producers successfully expressed the violent era of World War II with great honesty, revealing the hate of the Nazis and the conditions of the concentration camps, while simultaneously remaining child appropriate.  Likewise, Corrie's love for the Jewish people, and her struggles while in the camp are well depicted.

The content of this film is heavy enough that I would not leave my son, currently 3 1/2, to watch it alone, although it is one that we will often sit and watch together.  It blesses my heart to hear his little voice say, ""All the clocks are safe!"" the code the Ten Boom family used to inform each other that their Jewish friends in hiding were safe.  There are many lessons that can be drawn from this story, my favorite being a real life depiction of laying ones life down for their friends.  As I watch this film with my son, I remind him that under the Nazi Law the Jewish people should have died, but the Ten Boom Family took their place, just like how we should die under the Law but Messiah Yeshua took our place.  It is a great lesson in the Gospel for that reason.  The story also has a power message of forgiveness, as Corrie meets face to face with a SS soldier who beat her in a camp.  He asks for her forgiveness, which she humbly grants.

In the ""Special Features"" menu, this DVD includes a 55 minute documentary on Corrie Ten Boom and family.  The historical facts presented in this adult oriented film can be helpful in answering any questions that children might have while viewing the animated story.  It also includes teaching materials  saved in PDF form that can be downloaded and printed, then used for a lesson.

This is a great film for any family who desires to teach their children about sacrificial love, forgiveness, and God's heart for his Chosen people, through one of the darkest times of modern history.  I would even recommend this film to any Jewish family interested in teaching their children about the Holocaust, and Righteous Gentiles who helped protect their people.  Watch together as a family, and be blessed!",1388102400,4,2347,4.657766990291262
5943921,5,B00EU8RCHW,"The Corrie Ten Boom Story is the newest addition to the Torchlighters series.  For those who may be unfamiliar, The Torchlighters series is a series of short animated movies that introduces young viewers to men and women from Christian history.  These movies are great for families to introduce many figures from Christian history to their children in a way that is fun for the kids.

The Corrie Ten Boom story drops the viewer into the middle of World War II and does a good job of showing how Nazi Germany truly despised others.  One soldier makes a statement that shows the hatred when he says that ""you have to get rid of the bad to salvage the good.""  This is exactly what the Nazi's thought they where doing by slaughtering so many Jews, and this is where the story takes us.  We get introduced to the ten Boom family and get to see how God used this family and their watch repair shop to help so many people.  The ten Boom family begins to help these Jewish people because they find out that ""the rumor is they are being rounded up and......exterminated."" Their reasoning is stated very clearly:  ""The Good Shepherd gave His life for His sheep.  Can we do anything less for God's chosen people?""  So, the ten Booms used code words to bring Jews who needed protection into their ""hiding place"", referring to needy people as ""watches.""

The story continues to follow Corrie and her family as they are found out by Nazi soldiers and thrown into a camp.  Corrie and her sister show amazing courage throughout this time, even when they deal with doubt.  Corrie prays a pray at one point saying: ""We have done what we thought was your will. Help me to trust that you have not forgotten me.""  What a wonderful prayer for young minds to hear in a video as they watch the one praying that pray suffer in a concentration camp.  So many details from the life of Corrie ten Boom made it into this short (30 minute) video.  The video ends with Corrie being released and immediately going back to help everyone that she can and traveling around to tell her story.

This is one of the more difficult stories to tell to younger children simply because it is so full of hate and death, but I feel that there is a good balance and presentation in this movie.  The recommended age range is 8-12 and I think this is a good age to be able to have healthy conversations with kids about man's depravity and the evil that exists in our hearts.  It also shows that God can use any situation to get glory and use it for the good of His children.

I would highly recommend this video to any Christian parent looking for ways to introduce their children to men and women in Christian history.

I received a free copy of this DVD from Vision Video in exchange for an honest review.",1385164800,6,2759,4.434523809523809

I myself walk with away with my faith renewed and courage to follow Christ no matter what. The story of Corries Ten Bloom is well presented. Stories are not simplified, any one of any age can enjoy them. My children ages 12 and 13 always pay attention because they are well written. I highly recommend all of these stories.

5943962,4,B00EU8RCHW,"I give this 4 stars only because of the combination of computer animation and handrawn animation as I would prefer the production to be one or the other. Having said that, the Corrie ten Boom story is arguably one of the more powerful and moving of those currently in The Torchlighters series of animations. Note: These Torchlighters stories are not just for children. In fact, some adults may find it virtually impossible to sit through this one without shedding at least one tear. One very important element presented in this story is the prophetic word, which more and more believers will come to value, particularly in these latter days.",1436918400,,641,4.889908256880734

5943976,5,B00EU8RCHW,"Great!  Mild but poignant introduction to WWII issues for younger elementary kids from a Christian perspective.  Some scenes are a little intense, so I'd recommend possibly previewing first if your child tends to be sensitive.

The most emotionally difficult scenes were: when the Jews were being rounded up by the Nazis in the beginning and their shops vandalized by soldiers; when the soldiers raid the Ten Boom's home and arrest the Ten Booms; when Betsy is beaten by a guard (the camera does not show it, but you hear her crying out and a shadow of her being struck followed by Corrie's angry struggle not to retaliate on her sister's behalf); and finally the torment of Corrie when she realizes that Betsy has died.  All of these are mild in comparison to what it was in real life, but still could be overwhelming to some children.  Use good parental discretion as each child is likely to respond differently.  My kids were entranced and sobered, but they didn't seem too shaken.

It led to valuable discussion after watching.  This would also possibly be a good video to watch during a unit on forgiveness, gratitude, righteousness in the face of opposition, or trials as these themes are very strong throughout.",1430870400,14,1218,4.822115384615385

I saw an interview with the surviving Sister, and it impacted me when she told about the fleas (and that conversation did not happen on day 1),  She looked directly ""at me"" and said her sister said, "" I will NEVER thank God for the Fleas!"" and 2 days before everyone was released, that sister died.  The one that survived was the one that had been the most positive and kind. I'm sure they both loved the Lord and served Him to the best of their ability, but their was a difference between the two of them.
  The surviving sister fully believed that her sister did not come home because of the statement about the fleas.  And I remember this statement because it made a strong impact on me.
  Thankfulness and Forgiving others is not easy. Taming the Tongue seems impossible; but these things must be accomplished in order to be pleasing to The Lord.",1429660800,2,977,4.418994413407821

5943999,5,B00EU8RCHW,"My daughter and I watched the DVD together. In spots, I had some difficulty understanding what the characters were saying, but overall the sound quality is good. Some of the imagesthough animatedmight be disturbing for the youngest viewers; like the scene of the Nazis banging on doors with the butts of their guns and yanking people out onto the streets. Betsie is beaten with a club by a German guard in the camp and an ill-mannered nurse informs Corrie when she comes to see her sister that she is in there with the other dead bodies. Female prisoners are seen being carted off in trucks to the gas chambers; but while Corrie looks upon the gas chambers, it is not made apparent to young viewers what is going on there. So there is definitely historical accuracy worked into this production.

This is a moving story that will remind readers/viewers of the power of forgiveness and how leaning on faith can bring you through adversity. I am glad to add this DVD to our home library. It would also make a fabulous addition to a church library.

I received a copy of this DVD from the Christian History Institute. This review contains my honest opinions, which I have not been compensated for in any way.",1405555200,2,1204,4.621495327102804

5944001,5,B00EU8RCHW,"The topic of the Nazi regime and its persecution of those who rose in opposition is a difficult one, especially for young children.

Many of history's more gruesome details are merely suggested or left out altogether, but I still recommend previewing before showing this movie to a young child.",1403308800,3,421,5.0285714285714285

8609421,5,B00EU8RCHW,"Amazing !!!  This movie about Corrie Ten Boom is just awesome !  The way the story unfolds and the art style is just awesome.  I watched these movies with the whole family.  It is does not have very graphic parts that are inappropriate for children IMHO.  Parents should watch it first beforehand, before showing it to kids though as it does deal with the grim topic of the holocust.  Every part of the story is very moving and my wife was crying through many parts of the movie.  It taught my wife and I, as well the kids many indispensable lessons in faith, and to be joyful and persevere even despite persecutions.  The Torchlighters have outdone themselves,  I've enjoyed all the stories in their series about these giants of faith !.  I highly recommend this movie without reservations.",1499558400,3,791,4.666666666666667

8609424,5,B00EU8RCHW,I showed this to my grandkids that are 5-10.  They all loved it and asked many questions.  They took it to their school and it was shown to all of the fourth graders.  It's a great way to start conversations with your kids about the Holocaust and living courageously for God.,1491609600,,275,4.352941176470588

8609426,5,B00EU8RCHW,"Well drawn out story in a quick 30 minute video.  Not too scary for young ones, despite the material.  Humor straight from the pages of Corrie ten Boom's book, ""The Hiding Place.""  Beautiful story of trusting God through hardships and forgiving others like God does with us.  My girls (11 and 9) watched it over and over.  Highly recommend this one.",1485129600,,349,4.655737704918033
