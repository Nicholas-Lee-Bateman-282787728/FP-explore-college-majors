It's finally available on DVD - and with English subtitles, too!!!

A film by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson.

Norway in the 10th century.

Askur, son of the powerful Thorgeir marries Embla, daughter of one of the few remaining landowners in Norway, in a pagan ceremony. King Olav, a ruthless Christian, wants to eradicate all traces of non-christian beliefs and captures the two of them during the ceremony.

In order to free Embla, Askur must travel to Iceland and convert the people there to Catholicism.
