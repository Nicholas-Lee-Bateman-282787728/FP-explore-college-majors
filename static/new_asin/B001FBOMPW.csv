8301815,2,B001FBOMPW,"This dvd is less than an hour long.  Unfortunately, you learn absolutely nothing for half of it.  Most of the movements are repetitive in content and the explanations are not even good.  Also, the editing is very poor, as the instructor messes up his descriptions way too many times for a professional dvd.  I find it hard to believe that ""Hypno"" put this out, since his stuff is typically much better.  Air walk is not a common dvd topic, so I appreciate the undertaking.  However, I don't think anyone should spend money on this particular dvd.  I would watch it for free because there are about 5 total minutes of useful information.  Hopefully this guy can try again and deliver a real instructional dvd.",1288656000,,708,4.653225806451613
