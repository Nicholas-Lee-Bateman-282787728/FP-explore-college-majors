542291,4,6303038816,"The DVD version (Gemstone Entertainment 40315) I purchased of this film-noir flick (which I've never seen before) caught my eye because it featured a large close-up of Lee Van Cleef's mug, giving the beady-eyed villian top-billing.

Well, it's a trick that generic companies use to lure customers -- it worked on me. Van Cleef actually has fifth billing, but nonetheless has a substantial supporting role as one of the heavies.

This movie actually stars John Payne, a B-actor of considerable talents, whom I've only seen in one other movie, ""Miracle On 34th Street"" (he played the lawyer defending Edmund Gwynn's Santa Claus).

Payne portrays Joe, an ex-con who inadvertently gets framed for a bank heist. The plot is more Hitchcock than film noir, as it revolves around Payne dashing off to Mexico to clear his name and nail the baddies.

The cast is very solid: Jack Elam plays Pete, the man Joe gets mistaken for. Yet, even though both men's destinies collide, Pete is the real patsy -- it is his weakness that leads to his death, while fall guy Joe plays it cool and ultimately triumphs.

Preston Foster, Van Cleef and Neville Brand round out the cast, and provide a good mix of personalities to play off Payne. The only bit of unfortunate casting (as well as scripting) is Coleen Gray as Payne's love interest, who tries to get him out of the jam. It's clear that her character was written purely as a foil, to move the plot along. This, too, is more Hitchcockian than film-noir, but I would have preferred a cool dame like Ruth Roman or Peggy Knudsen in that role.

I can't exactly say it's one of the movie's flaws, but there's no ""femme fatale""; Payne draws nearer to his demise solely through the actions of evil men, not wicked temptresses.

For a B-movie, this flick has a lot of good production values: The cinematography, pacing, fight scenes and music are all excellent, though hardly quintessential of the genre. For the best examples of film noir, check out Jacques Tourneur's ""Out of the Past,"" Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity,"" Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep,"" John Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon,"" Orson Welles' ""The Lady from Shanghai"" and Raoul Walsh's ""White Heat.""

Nonetheless, this movie easily has earned its place alongside such noir classics as ""Murder, My Sweet,"" ""Johnny Stool Pidgeon,"" ""Detour"" and ""One Lonely Night.""",1094860800,2,2347,4.8793969849246235

This really is a gritty little crime caper flick. If you watch it, it will be difficult to ignore how the film might have influenced a guy like Quentin Tarantino in the conception of RESERVOIR DOGS.

542294,4,6303038816,"Director Phil Karlson (whose best-known work is probably the 1972 crime drama ""Walking Tall"")switched from being a decent director of routine films to one of the most innovative and influential crime film directors of them all with a remarkable series of tough,distinctive thrillers beginning with this one in 1952 and going on to include ""99 River Street"" in 1953, ""The Phenix City Story"" in 1955, and ""The Brothers Rico"" in 1957. ""Kansas City Confidential"" follows the pulling off of a well-planned and executed robbery that's been carefully thought out by an embittered ex-police officer. He plans it so that Joe Rolfe(played by John Payne) will be framed for the robbery. Rolfe is a WWII veteran who has some problems with the law in his past. After being grilled and ultimately (and grudgingly) released by the police,he pursues the thieves to Mexico,looking for revenge. Payne is fine in a sharp turnaround from the lightweight roles he usually played in the 1940s. Preston Foster is also good as the mastermind of the robbery, as is Coleen Gray as his daughter, a bright,decent young woman. The best performances however,are those given by three of the greatest heavies in movie history: Jack Elam,Neville Brand,and Lee Van Cleef,in the roles of the thieves who pull off the robbery. Elam,who is first seen sweating heavily and rifling through an overflowing ashtray in a dingy hotel room,looking for a cigarette butt with a few puffs left on it,is particularly good, but Brand and Van Cleef ooze menace and bad blood in just about every scene they're in. The film is filled with close-ups,tough,terse dialogue, and brutal (at least for its time) violence. The payoff of the film goes kind of soft, after what's come before, but this is still a first-rate example of cold,tough 1950s film noir,from a real master of the genre.",1012003200,9,1833,4.993464052287582

542446,4,6303038816,"Kansas City Confidential, 1952 film

The purpose of this picture is to expose the ""perfect crime"" whose true solution is not entered in any case history. The film begins with a view of a large building with tall buildings in the background. A man makes a delivery to a florist shop. A bank opens at 10AM. There is a money shipment by armored car. Pete Harris gets a call about a big job. They will all wear masks to protect their identity. Tony Romano and Boyd Kane are next. We see their well-planned robbery. They escape in a huge moving van that swallows their truck. The real florist truck is stopped by the police. The robbers will go into hiding until its safe to spend the money. The real driver is given the third degree to make him confess. How long can he hold out? Then the actual truck is found in that van. ""These things happen."" Joe Rolfe is now infamous.

Joe is given a tip about Pete Harris in Mexico. He follows this lead and finds the dice table. Harris decides to talk. But police show up and there is a shooting. Pete will not board the airplane. Romano is at the hotel, as is Kane. None of the money has been recovered. We learn more about retired Foster. His daughter Helen arrives with news. The men play poker in the bar. They must wait two days for the money. Who is Mr. Big? How can Harris drop his pistol? Will bad luck follow? Helen arrives to save him. Foster makes plans for a meeting. Harris talks to Romano and Kane by the well. What are Foster's plans? ""Don't miss."" They go to the boat. Will there be a conflict over the loot? Will the good guys win in the end? Dead men tell no tales. Mr. Andrews provides the happy ending.

This is a good story that differs from the usual plots about a bank robbery. There always seems to be a problem in splitting the loot, as in other stories. Only those with a prior personal bond seem immune (the James-Younger gang). But this personal bond identifies the suspects. Note how the handling of a suspect then contrasts to modern films. Would torturing Joe Rolfe have solved the crime? Were the correct inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence? Was this meant to be a lesson to the audience.

542450,3,6303038816,"This review is for the blu-ray version of Kansas City Confidential by HD Cinema Classics

When I watched this movie after purchasing this blu-ray, it was for the first time that I would be seeing Kansas City Confidential.

The quality of the disc is no better than average. It's not bad but it's nothing to write home about. There are plenty of spots where the picture is a bit blurry. Still, I always appreciate getting a restored version of anything. In the extra's there is a before and after comparison and what is immediately apparent is that there isn't a big difference. Mostly you just see a few bits of 'noise' are taken out.

As far as the movie goes, if you are reading this you probably have already seen the movie. I wasn't all that thrilled with the plot and it is simply an average story. The use of 'Kansas City' is minor and doesn't really factor into the plot. In fact most of the movie takes place in Mexico. I suppose at the time that they were trying to 'cash in' on the name.

Recommended for fans of film noir (even though this isn't much of a noir).",1465344000,,1073,4.35

542509,5,6303038816,"Kansas City Confidential (1952)is definitely one of my favorite film noir style movies I've seen to date. A somewhat complex storyline combine with some nice camera work makes this film an enjoyable watch. The characters are nicely developed and quite unique. The bad guys wear some leather masks to hide their identity from each other and those are cool and creepy at the same time.

The story is about a man who is wrongly accused of a bank heist. He drives a floral delivery truck for the florist next door to the bank. His truck is duplicated as a getaway vehicle in the heist by the gang of thieves. He is captured after the police find him in his work truck and tortured by the cops. He then escapes and discovers that the gang that pulled off the robbery is hiding out in Mexico. He travels south and once in Mexico he meets up with one of the gang members and steals the mask the crook wore in the heist. Things get more complicated once he meets a beautiful woman who falls for him. It turns out that she is the daughter of Mr. Big, the ringleader of the gang.

Will he get justice? Will he get the girl? These questions are answered and many others too in this thrilling film noir movie. I can't recommend this movie enough to any fan of this style of film. The BluRay version, from The Film Detective, that I watched is clean and very well duplicated. I mention this because this film has been released by many other companies but many are terrible copies, some even from VHS tapes! This is NOT one of those bad copies.

Grab some popcorn and a drink of your choice and settle in for a couple hours of classic movie enjoyment with this latest release of Kansas City Confidential.

The transfer of this film is nothing short of amazing since it had been neglected for years & put through public domain hell. The Film Detective blu-ray company seems to be the experts for restoring these back & white nearly forgotten masterpieces. So do yourself a favor and buy this title.

542511,5,6303038816,"First, let me say I actually own the DVD of this film and not the Blu-ray. I wanted to write a review of the film and Amazon now only shows the Blu-ray for some reason. The DVD I have is the MGM Film Noir official release of this film. I can highly recommended this movie for any fan of film noir. It's a great film and the DVD video quality is quite good.

I cannot say how good the blu-ray is or if it has any bonus features. Hopefully someone who sees the blu-ray will write a review and let us know. However, if it is an official MGM release, the worse they can do is transfer the same print they already have used for DVD, which is good.

I originally had this movie, along with many others, on a couple cheap film noir collections that I picked up at Wal-Mart. Of the 20 or so movies in those collections, I thought 4 were really great films that I'd like to have a good DVD transfer of. This movie is among my favourite film noir and when the price finally went down (around $10 or less) I ordered it. The picture and sound quality is far superior on this DVD, compared to the cheapie collections I had. Oddly enough, I did find and order 3 other films as well... and one transfer (for the film QUICKSAND, starring Mickey Rooney) was actually WORSE than on my cheapie collection.",1456617600,,1286,4.202429149797571

Even if you're not I'd still recommend giving it a watch, I was surprised it was that good after coming across it online. I watch many crime films regularly from the classics to more unknown, minor films. Some of the ones I've watched were very dated and forgettable, Kansas City Confidential isn't one of them. I was somewhat skeptical about it even but it was well written and suspenseful for it's time. Tarintino even used some ideas from it in ""Reservoir Dogs"". The theme has been used in many others as well: trying to pull off the perfect crime. The main revolves around 4 robbers who are each given a mask to hide their identity, the only identification is the 4 kings they've been handed from a deck of cards. The acting was fairly good throughout, John Payne played a good lead role but I particularly enjoyed the roles from Colleen Gray and Preston Foster. I recognized Gray from Kubrick's ""The Killing"" but hadn't seen her in many other roles. She plays the love interest of Payne's character, Foster plays her father and the mastermind of the crime. Preston Foster was a popular actor in the 1930s but this is a great later role, his best role to date in my opinion. The film is shot in black and white but the production is still quite good and clear.

The story itself, the casting, performances, directing and editing, everything is first rate. There is some tendency I suppose to assume a black and white fifties crime movie has to be of less quality than a technicolor spectacular, but other than glitz which would be inappropriate for the genre this film is lacking in no way. It is five stars all the way. Top shelf film noir and well worth your time.

Since it is on the same DVD the Dragnet episode is also interesting if not laughable. Marijuana turns normal teenagers into savage violent animals. My my where did their parents go wrong?

He does a few days behind bars, and avoids the big house at the last second, but not without taking home a set of souvenir cracked ribs, courtesy the cops. (In fact, there's lots of fist work in this flick.) Joe then makes like Harrison Ford in the Fugitive and sets into motion a plan to deal himself in to the game that almost cost him a 20-year stretch. The question is, will he rake in the kitty and escort the dame off into the Mexican sunset...or will he go out holding aces and eights?
Definitively noir, but much more modern than pre-War/pre-Pearl. This not only seems modern by 1952 standards, Tarantino thought it so fresh, he cribbed the plot and made a film called Reservoir Dogs with it.

542678,4,6303038816,"Kansas City Confidential is one of those film noir titles that you would definitely watch at midnight or later. The film isn't exactly perfect, but it still has loads of suspense and drama. I did find myself enjoying it for the right reasons. Despite a few cliches, the plot was interesting enough for me to see what happens during and after the climax. The music is good and the dialogue is direct, never feeling out-of-place. The black-and-white cinematography is beautifully handled. The often grim noir style (especially in the first half of the film) gives the film a very atmospheric feel. The acting is a bit off in places, except for Payne and Foster (both of whom give great performances). Coleen Gray, sadly, is the least compelling performer in the entire film: her acting is wooden for most of the time she's onscreen.

Like I said, Kansas City Confidential isn't really perfect, but it is still a tense and riveting film to watch.

Since I've now been looking into Film Noir and re-discovering alot of gems, I thought I'd give this one another look, especially since it was put out by MGM and wasn't a public domain cheap job (hint...ALPHA).

My God, what a great movie, delivering just like the dvd cover states, ""A Tough and Taught drama, bristling with Suspense!"". And the MGM dvd is a beautiful print, crisp and sharp, making for me a viewing experience akin to sitting in a theater in 1952. And how refreshing seeing REAL-TIME action from real men instead of some lame preppy-boy backflipping while firing pistols in both hands during a 30-story fall from some corporate building in Computer City.

I was really amazed at just how good this little Noir crime thriller actually was! The acting, cinematography, direction, story-line, all top-notch. And for 3 henchmen we get Neville Brand, Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam all in the same movie! It doesn't get any better than that!

...I wasn't expecting much and it floored me.
They often say that you remember movies viewed in your youth with a certain fondness that rapidly dissolves into reality when rewatching that same film many years later. Well, the exact opposite is the case here. As an impressionable lad KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL left no enduring mark on my psyche. Viewing it many years later left me stunned that such a great B-film could be made in 1952, looking so fresh and ""new"", especially when compared against the current video-game action crap that we're forced to digest today.

542744,4,6303038816,"I have said this many times. Sure I am an aficionado of film noir, especially those 1940s detective epics like the film adaptations of Dashiell Hammet's Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe in The Big Sleep. Nothing like that gritty black and white film, ominous musical background, and shadowy moments to stir the imagination. Others in the genre like Gilda, The Lady From Shang-hai, and Out Of The Past rate a nod because in addition to those attributes mentioned above they have classic femme fatales to add a little off-hand spice to the plot line, and, oh ya, they look nice too. Beyond those classics this period (say, roughly from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s produced many black and white film noir set pieces, some good, some not so good. For plot line, and plot interest, the film under review, Kansas City Confidential, is in the former category.

And why shouldn't it be. One fall guy Joe (fall guys seem always to be named Joe, regular Joes I guess), played here in a understated way by John Payne, a little the worst for wear in post-World War II America, having had a few legal problems of his own, gets caught up in the dragnet after a major heist (over a million dollars, a lot of money then but just pocket change today) of a bank, in of all places Kansas City. Now all of this, aside from the criminal intent and cash reward, has been set-up by a disgruntled, vengeful ex-cop (played by Preston Foster) who masterminds the whole thing. Of course such a major heist then (as now) requires several, um, ""associates"", in this case masked associates (for their own and Foster's self-protection against the dreaded ""stoolie' syndrome. Said associates are not anyone you or I would want to hang around with, these guys are strictly losers, especially one grafter extraordinaire, Pete Harris, played to manic perfection by Jack Elam. (The others are perennial bad guys Lee Van Cleef and Neville Brand).

Now Joe, as one might expect, takes umbrage, yes, umbrage at having taken a beating from the cops, and also for being set up as the fall guy. So, naturally, as any crime noir hero worth his salt would do, he is going to get to the bottom of this thing come hell or high water. And the rest of the plot line centers of following the clues, and following the sun to sunny Mexico (low film budget faux Mexico, to be sure) to undo the bad guys, and maybe catch a reward. Or at least a stray gringa or senorita. Naturally he does, the gringa part anyway, although she turns out to be mastermind ex-cop's daughter (law student daughter, by the way, played by Coleen Gray). Other than the inevitable tacky ending ( I won't spoil your fun by telling what it is) this one moves along nicely, is filled with some nice twists, and is, as usual with black and white noir films great on those shadowy takes which reveal evil in the making. Especially those loser, grifter, chain-smoking Jack Elam takes. Some noirs you watch for the magic camera work, some for the femme fatales that drive the story line, some for the tough guys and their gaff. This one you get for the plot line.",1298160000,2,3116,4.60251798561151

While Blu-Ray transfers typically make details sharper, shadows blacker and faces more detailed, these two films' details seem softer and less focused despite the BD transfers.

Ironically, this can be proven by watching the short side-by-side comparison each disc offers as an extra feature.  The non-Blu-Ray half of the screen looks sharper with more relief.  First time I've seen that.",1297987200,15,588,5.223404255319149

One of the best John Payne noir films -- Definitely entertaining and you can watch this over and over again, catching some scenes you may have missed for full enjoyment -- In many of his films he was an ordinary-guy protagonists in the noir cycle -- Payne is tough, all right, but still shows the flop-sweat of fear; and he's smart, too, but because he's forced to be - what he's trying to hang onto is all he's got, that's gotta be noir at it's best.

542817,4,6303038816,"This is a review for KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL, a 1952 MGM release directed by Phil
Karlson and starring John Payne, Colleen Gray and Preston Foster. KANSAS CITY
CONFIDENTIAL is now a MGM DVD release.

Joe Rolfe, played by John Payne, is an ex-con and is and driving a floral delivery truck making regularly scheduled deliveries every day.  One nine am delivery is to a shop next to a bank which has an armoured truck to pick up cash up every day about the same time.  One morning all hell breaks loose when some masked hold up men shoot the armoured car guards and use a similar floral delivery truck to haul the cash away about one minute after the actual floral delivery truck has pulled away.

The police catch up with Joe Rolfe and his truck and arrest and then question him for quite some time.  He denies everything and eventually is let go because there really is no evidence
against him.  Joe Rolfe is determined to discover the identity of the crooks and clear his name as well as return the money.  One clue leads to another as the trail (and story) gets a little more dark and twisted with each discovery. Eventually Joe Rolfe finds himself in Mexico, in a resort town, looking for and finding the crooks and having a hand in their
eventual fate.

I think Kansas City Confidential is a fine film, it seems more like an independent effort than a studio product. It is well directed and acted, a top grade noir all around.
I say it's a noir because of the almost hopeless situation Joe Rolfe, an everyman with a past, finds himself in.  That is not to mention the crooks and their eventual dire situation,
without giving too much away.

If you have the chance to see Kansas City Confidential I would recommend it.

542823,4,6303038816,"I liked this film but I got spoiled with the first 20-30 minutes. It started off so intense that I thought this was going to be fantastic: an incredibly edgy film noir. It still wound up good overall, but it never lived up to that great beginning.

The story slows down a bit once the scene shifts from the heist in Kansas City to the rendezvous of the bandits down in Mexico. It has as a full lulls here and there but still does enough things right to keep your interest.

What it does is right is emphasize two things that a good film noir provides: tension and paranoia. All the crooks are assembled in one spot but only the boss knows who the others are. They don't know what any of the gang members look like since all of the thieves had to wear masks throughout the planning and execution of the crime.

I thought ""Tim Foster,"" played by Preston Foster, was the best character in the film, probably because he was right in the middle of everything. He was a bitter ex-cop and the brains behind the whole scheme.

Coleen Gray plays ""Helen Foster,"" but she doesn't really come into the story much until the last half hour. I mention her because her character did one implausible thing after another, things NO woman would do and softened the rough edges of this movie, which was a mistake. ""Helen"" wasn't even needed in this film. It would have been better as a straight male only tough film noir.

Speaking of tough: how about this ""Rogue's gallery:"" Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef and Neville Brand? Now there are three good faces for this genre of film. They were the other gang members

542826,4,6303038816,"""Dark Alibi"" director Phil Karlson's ""Kansas City Confidential"" qualifies as a crisply-made, smartly-plotted, entertaining heist caper about the perfect crime.  This imaginative, 1952 release from United Artists and producer Edward Small about an innocent man framed for a robbery that he didn't commit teems with interesting characters, a seasoned cast, edgy predicaments, and a fine resolution.  Good guy John Payne musters considerable credibility as the flawed protagonist who is punished for the crime, while a dream cast of classic heavies--Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef, and Neville Brand--enjoy their ill-gotten gains until our hero can pay them back with interest.  ""Red River's"" Coleen Gray plays Payne's love interest, but her character is strictly peripheral in the greater scheme of the action.  Yes, she does figure into the plot, but she isn't front and center like the rest of the cast, including Preston Foster as the mastermind of the a million dollar hold-up.

""Narrow Margin"" lenser George E. Diskant's moody black & white photography is first-rate, and several camera angles stand out, enhancing the thrills and chills.  Rowland Brown and Harold Bruce provided the basis for the story, while Harry Essex and George Bruce penned the tightly-knit screenplay with uncredited assistance from both Karlson and Payne.  Clocking in at a trim 99 minutes, ""Kansas City Confidential"" doesn't squander a second and never wears out its welcome.  Moreover, some commentators have described it as a film noir entry when it really isn't film noir.  The interesting thing is that Karlson's crime thriller seems a little ahead of its time with its post-modern spin on events.  The cops are portrayed as pretty ruthless and the mastermind has a back story that makes him a tragic character.  All in all, ""Kansas City Confidential"" delivers more than the usual 1952 thriller about a robbery.

The film opens with this foreword:  ""In the police annuals of Kansas City are written lurid chapters of criminals apprehended and brought to punishment.  But it is the purpose of this picture to expose the amazing operations of a man who conceived and executed a `perfect crime,' the true solution of which is not entered in any case history, and could well be entitled `Kansas City Confidential.'""

The action occurs in three parts.  The mastermind checks his plan.  He has decided to rob an armored car as the cops tote the money sacks out to the vehicle.  A florist truck usually parks near where the armored car is parked.  The florist delivery man, Joe Rolfe (John Payne of ""Tripoli""), parks his truck and takes flowers into a building.  The mastermind, Tim Foster (Preston Foster of ""Guadalcanal Diary""), has been planning the heist fastidiously as a close-up reveals a time table of events he has made.  For example, he notes the times that police squad cars cruise past, the arrival and departure of the Western Florist Delivery truck as well as the Bank Armored cars.  Foster has timed everything at least five times for pin-point accuracy.  He has calculated that he will need between two and four minutes to pull the job.  He picks three criminals, Pete Harris (Jack Elam of ""The Comancheros"") a trigger-happy, chain-smoking, dice gambler; ladies man Tommy Romano (Lee Van Cleef of ""High Noon"") who is a habitual criminal, and Boyd Kane (Neville Brand of ""Riot in Cell Block 3"") a cop killer who chews bubble-gum.

The second part involves the bank hold-up.  As Foster has planned it, the criminals slip up beside the armored car and in unless than four minutes, they appropriate the money bags and hightail with one guard snapping off a couple of rounds at them.  Predictably, the Kansas City cops pull over Joe, search his florist delivery truck, and haul him off to the station for some police brutality.  Eventually, the authorities discover the abandoned florist delivery truck, but by then Joe has lost his job.  ""Thanks for nothing,"" he utters contemptuously.

We learn that Joe fought in World War II hero and saved a man's life on Iwo Jima.  Joe's grateful pal provides Joe with a tip about Harris' whereabouts through a third party.  What Joe doesn't realize until he catches up with shifty-eyed Jack Elam is that Foster planned the crime wearing a mask.  He almost entrusted each criminal enough money to leave the country until he thinks thing have cooled down enough to divide the loot.  None of them knows what Foster looks like and they don't know what the others look like because Foster forced them to always wear masks in front of each other.  ""I've made you cop-proof and stool-pigeon proof,"" Foster brags.  He gives them each a tore playing card in case he doesn't make it to the split-up.  Later, Tijuana authorities get the drop on Harris as Joe and he are about to leave for the Central American hamlet of Borados.  Harris tries to shoot his way out and dies.  Somehow, Joe appropriates Harris' luggage with the mask and the torn poker card that Foster gave each of them.

What sets ""Kansas City Confidential"" apart from most B-pictures about the perfect crime is mastermind Tim Foster's motivation.  He spent 20 years on the KCPD and he was forced to retire because of politics.  He engineers this perfect crime so that he can weasel his way back into the good graces of the department.  Even his daughter has figured out a way for him to get another shot at being a cop.  However, Foster has gone beyond the point of no return.  Nevertheless, he almost pulls it off.  Tracking down Foster and company is no picnic for Joe, but he manages to clear himself in the end rather neatly.  Karlson does an outstanding job pacing this little thriller and revealing only a bit at a time.  The scene where Joe loses his revolver at the swimming pool and finds himself pitting against Kane and Romano in his bungalow is terrific.

""Kansas City Confidential"" is worth watching again and again.

The MGM/UA DVD delivers a good-looking picture with great audio and English subtitles.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in the way of extras, such as a making of documentary, a trailer, or a bio about director Phil Karlson.  However, it tops the public domain copies.",1229126400,,6175,4.9169082125603865
542887,5,6303038816,"Driving a truckful of posies for a florist seems about as safe an occupation an ex-con could hope for. But for John Payne in Phil Karlson's Kansas City Confidential, it gets him framed for a million-two robbery. His trouble is that you can set a clock by his punctual rounds, and that one of his deliveries coincides with the arrival of the armored car at the bank next door. His comings and goings have been meticulously stop-watched by the mastermind of the heist (Preston Foster), a disgruntled policeman forced into retirement who seeks his weird sort of revenge.

Foster's plan assembles a gang who wear masks during the plotting so they can't recognize one another, or him. Payne's just the innocent fall guy who's thrown to the cops. Those cops try to beat a confession out of him, but it won't stick. He nonetheless loses his job and ends up on the front pages as the prime suspect. So he goes on the earie and follows the robbers (Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef and Neville Brand) down to Mexico, where they're to meet with `Mr. Big' again and divvy up the take.

The spanner in the works proves to be Foster's daughter (Coleen Gray), striking sparks with Payne as he poses as one of the conspirators killed in Tijuana en route to the rendezvous. Gray's an aspiring lawyer in ignorance of daddy's scheme - which is to turn over the robbers, thus rehabilitating himself with the force, and to collect the insurers' reward of $300-large.

Those south-of-the-border resort bungalows, during the noir cycle at any rate, were hotbeds of passion and gunplay. Karlson gives us a little of the former (not his long suit) but plenty of the latter. Over cardgames in the lobby and chance meetings amid the subtropical foliage at night, the unknown players try to sniff one another out and gain whatever edge they can. Their final gathering, aboard a boat called the Manana, shakes out as a crashing intersection of cross-purposes.

Like Dick Powell, Payne started off as a crooner and hoofer, a light leading man (his best remembered role is as Maureen O'Hara's fianc in Miracle on 34th Street). But in three films under Phil Karlson's direction (plus Robert Florey's in The Crooked Way and Allan Dwan's in Slightly Scarlet), he ended up one of the most convincing ordinary-guy protagonists in the noir cycle. He's tough, all right, but still shows the flop-sweat of fear; and he's smart, too, but because he's forced to be - what he's trying to hang onto is all he's got.

Off-screen, he was even smarter, seeing the potential revenue in color films (like Hell's Island and Slightly Scarlet) when selling to television was at most a pipe dream. But as an actor in the ambiguous world of film noir, he's seldom given the credit he deserves. He's every bit as good as Powell or Glenn Ford, if not quite so emblematic as Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum or Burt Lancaster. Karlson's brutal, accomplished works late in the noir cycle gave Payne his place in the dark sun.",1223856000,6,2962,4.710424710424711
542888,5,6303038816,"Kansas City Confidential is a skilled and exciting Film Noir made at the tail end of the Film Noir Genre.  Preston Foster (Tim Foster), the former head of detectives, puts together a major caper after being ousted from office by a shift in the political structure.  His idea, to rob a bank using three local thugs played by Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef and Nevil Brand, three of Hollywood's premier Bad Guys at the time.

Foster's plan is to maintain anonymity by requiring all the men to wear masks when they meet for the first time.  He also issues each man half of a playing card as the key of mutual recognition for when the men reunite in Mexico to split the score.  Joe Rolfe (John Payne) is an ex-con who gets inadvertently pulled in and accused of complicity in the crime.  Once released, Rolfe chases the men down in Mexico.

He co-starred with O'Hara, and Betty Grable in several movies, and he is known for musicals such as The Razor's Edge with Tyrone Power. In this crime drama, Payne plays an ex-con Joe Rolfe/Peter Harris who tries to clear his name when three unknown bank robbers use a florist truck similar to Harris's truck. When authorities find the truck used in the heist, they release Harris and he goes in search of three robbers; Boyd Kane (Neville Brand), Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef), and Pete Harris aka Johnson (Jack Elam). The heist is orchestrated by an ex-cop Tim Foster (Preston Foster). This adventure takes Harris to a resort town in Mexico where he not only tracks down the three robbers but also the mastermind, Tim Foster. The suspense in the movie is that the three robbers do not know each other except Tim Foster. During this drama, Harris meets Foster's beautiful daughter Helen Foster aka Pumpkin (Colleen Gray) who is studying to be an attorney. Obviously she falls in love with the charming Peter Harris. At the end the bad guys die and the good guy Harris wins. The movie has interesting plot and suspense, and John Payne offers a brilliant performance.

He's also an ex-con who has gone straight as a flower truck delivery man. There is a big bank robbery along his route & he has been set-up. The master mind of the robbery is  disaffected Police Chief Tim Foster who has been forced to retire. He hires a trio of thugs (Lee van Cleef, Neville Brand & Jack Elam) to help him. They all wear masks & don't know each other or the Chief.  The cops arrest Joe & try to beat a confession out of him. They have to let him go but not until he's lost his job. So he decides to go after the thieves that framed him. There is also a big reward for their capture &  return of the 1.2 million in cash. Joe gets a lead & catches up with Harris (Elam) in Mexico. Joe softens him up a bit & gets part of the story. Harris is heading for a small village where they are going divvy up the stolen money. Along the way Harris is killed by the local police. Joe assumes his identity & proceeds to meet with the others at the appointed meeting place in Mexico. Remember, he doesn't know them or they him except for the Chief who knows them all.

Then, the Chief's daughter, Helen (Colleen Grey) arrives unexpectedly to visit dad & complicates everything. She's not leaving & immediately takes up with Joe. The climax may come as a surprise.

542894,5,6303038816,"This is a film noir.  Made in 1952 in Black and White, it has the cynicism, it has the interesting plot twists that draw you into the story, it has the lead male in desperate circumstances beyond his control, but no femme fatale, no chiaroscuro, no stylishly odd camera angles.  This is one of the heist-themed noir films.  I found it very engaging and satisfying.  The story was believable, the acting was at times inspired, at other times just a bit lackluster, possibly due to a few weak spots in the script.  The DVD picture and sound are both excellent, and the disc has no extras.  Strange, but I found the leading male resembling Kevin Spacey at times, Jimmy Stewart at times, and Robert Mitchum at times...fun, but a bit distracting.  There are three ""heavies"" who stand out: Lee Van Cleef, Neville Brand, and Jack Elam are all famous for work they did in the 1950's through the 1970's, and it is very interesting to see them here as young men (without cowboy hats, too!)  These men have all brought their characters to life with great performances.  This film is in the second tier of its genre: Very good, but not essential.

542896,5,6303038816,"Made shortly before their contract with Hal Roach expired, 1940's ""A Chump at Oxford"" is obviously the team's last great hurrah. It is one of the L&H films which has aged gracefully, unlike the following work at Twentieth-Century Fox, in which the boys had no control over the material handed to them.
Happily, this film recalls some of the best L&H vehicles, in which there are no cumbersome romantic subplots or musical productions to intrude upon the boys' screen time. One never feels cheated here, because it's pure L&H from start to finish.
Opening with Stan & Ollie as meager street sweepers who accidentally foil a bank robbery and are rewarded scholarships, the story wastes no time in whisking them away to the prestigious Oxford University in England, where the fun really begins. The moment they set foot on Oxford grounds, they become targets for pranksters as they get lost in a maze of shrubbery and menaced by a ""ghost"". And true to form, they almost immediately run afoul of authority, this time in the person of the college dean.
But the real highlight is watching Laurel step out of character to portray Lord Paddington, a legendary scholar & athlete thought to have been long lost; that is, until a window falls on Stan's noggin, transforming his personality into Paddington. The ""ear wiggle"" that Stan performs when angered is something to be seen. And once again, Ollie's dignity is soiled; but by Lord Paddington this time, not Stan. Becoming Paddington's servant, L.P. delights in nicknaming Ollie ""fatty"", much to Ollie's never-ending annoyance. Just when Ollie has finally had enough, the window sill comes down once again, restoring Stan to his old dumb, lovable self.
The film quality of the transfer is so-so. There are some scratchy & jumpy places in the film, probably due to the original print's age and constant editing through the years.

But here it is - MGM is actually releasing (or has released, depending on when you read this) the ""official"" DVD for this fantastic Film Noir.  Based on their track record of releasing official versions of movies previously relegated to public domain releases (see He Walked By Night as an example - MGM's DVD is flawless!), this should see a drastic improvement in both image and sound quality over all of the previous versions released to date.

Retired police captain Tim Foster played by a tenacious, authoritative Preston Foster is the mastermind of a bank robbery which will net 1.2 million dollars.  He recruits an excellent trio of accomplices played by the wild eyed chain smoking Jack Elam, lanky ladies man Lee Van Cleef and burly tough guy Neville Brand.  As part of the plan Foster insists that all gang members wear hoods during all activities so that only he knows their identities.  They use a floral delivery van similar to one used by ex-GI and reformed ex-con John Payne who delivers flowers right next door to the bank, effectively framing him in the heist.

As the gang members flee the scene the police apprehend Payne and try to sweat him out to confess to the robbery.  Meanwhile Foster plans to let the stolen loot cool off and later divy it up in at a secret Mexican location.

Payne eventually gets exonerated but now jobless and excoriated, using a tip from a war buddy he follows the trail of Elam to Tijuana to attempt to clear himself.  Elam winds of getting killed by the local police and Payne assumes his identity.

Foster has summoned the gang members to the seaside town of Borado where they will divide up the loot.  They all converge on the town with Foster accompanied by his lawyer to be daughter played by the attractive Coleen Gray biding his time not revealing his identity.

In a long gripping sequence the action and dialogue between Payne and the gang members builds up a mountain of suspense and intrigue as they all try to get the upper hand.

542959,5,6303038816,"This review is for the 2002 Alpha/Gotham DVD

The movie starts with a mysterious man named Tim Foster (Preston Foster) trying to pull off the perfect robbery.  We don't know much about this mastermind and neither do the three crooks, Boyd Kane (Neville Brand), Pete Harris (Jack Elam) and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef) who were essentially blackmailed into being his accomplices.  In all phases of the recruiting, planning and execution of the robbery, Foster keeps his identity a secret by wearing a mask and so do his coerced thugs so if anyone does get caught, the others are protected from a potential stool pigeon.  The robbery goes off without a hitch, but unfortunately at the expense of patsy name Joe Rolfe (John Payne).  After the police finally come to the conclusion that someone setup Rolfe and the real crooks got away, Rolfe is released, and decides to track down the vermin that set him up.  Meanwhile, the four robbers go their separate ways with Foster taking the loot with a plan to meet the rest of the gang in Mexico to divide up the money.  Rolfe manages to tail Harris and later meets up with the remaining criminals at a Mexican resort and this sets up a suspenseful and thrilling second half of the film.  One major wrinkle is also added when Foster's daughter Helen (Colleen Gray) drops in by surprise to visit her father at the resort in the midst of this complex and potentially explosive situation.

For being a public domain, low cost DVD, I was pleasantly surprised how well this story was intelligently crafted.  Tim Foster not only masterminds a slick robbery, but figures out a brilliant means of settling things up with his cohorts in Mexico - of course to his own advantage.  John Payne is impressive in this leading role and based on this performance, I'm surprised he didn't have a much more successful career as a leading actor.  The three young accomplices, Brand, Elam and Van Cleef all did an exceptional job in their roles and of course each went on to have successful movie careers over several decades.  I highly recommend this film, especially to someone who appreciates the classic era of post-WWII noir pictures.

This is an Alpha/Gotham DVD and they typically turn out poor quality presentations of older movies.  The picture quality of this film is actually very good by their track record, but still far from the standards one would expect from a major studio.  It's still lacks sharpness and has plenty of noticeable flaws over the course of the movie, but the picture is still very viewable.

542960,4,6303038816,"""Kansas City Confidential"" opens with the declaration that it is about a hypothetical ""perfect crime"" that has never existed in the history of any law enforcement agency. The crime is a $1.2 million dollar bank heist orchestrated by Tim Foster (Preston Foster), a disgruntled ex-cop forced into retirement. Foster bullies three hoods into doing the job, using their criminal records against them and promising an equal split of the dough. Pete Harris (Jack Elam), Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand), and Foster hold up security guards as they transfer money to an armored car. Foster has insisted that everyone wear masks at all times so that his 3 accomplices cannot identify one another, making them ""cop-proof and stool pigeon-proof"". After the job, they go separate ways to await the pay-off. Meanwhile, the police pick up Joe Rolfe (John Payne), the driver of a florist delivery truck that looks like the crooks' getaway truck, and accuse him of the crime. Unable to beat a confession out of Rolfe, the police are compelled to release him, leaving Joe Rolfe angry, without a job, and hell-bent on finding out who framed him.

John Payne reminds me very much of Jimmy Stewart in this role. Although he was a lesser star than Stewart, Payne shares Stewart's versatility and ability to be a sympathetic, idealized everyman, but edgy and a little dangerous at the same time. Joe Rolfe is a good guy, but he's angry, frustrated, and fully capable of matching his enemies' ferocity. Neville Brand plays a thug, as he always did, in direct opposition to his real-life stature as a World War II hero, for which he was decorated 10 times.  ""Kansas City Confidential""'s most striking quality is its archetypally film noir fatalism. Joe Rolfe and Tim Foster's destinies become powerfully interdependent, even though the men do not know one another. As Pete Harris says to Joe, ""We didn't have nothing against you. We didn't even know you. It just fell that way."" Elam gives a stand-out, though brief, performance as a twitchy, menacing, loser of a criminal.  ""Kansas City Confidential"" isn't relentlessly hard-boiled, but it has enough menace and confusion to gratify film noir fans.

The DVD (Image Entertainment 2002): This print is watchable, but it's grainy in the grays and noticeably speckled. Bonus features include: ""Cast & Crew"", which is text biographies and ""noir filmographies"" for 6 members of the cast plus director Phil Karlson. ""Stills & Lobby Cards"" includes 9 black and white movie stills and 8 color lobby cards. ""Coleen Gray Interview"" (9 minutes) is a recent interview by author Eddie Muller with actress Colleen Gray, who plays the movie's ""good girl"". Gray talks about her role in the film, the other actors, and the qualities of film noir. There is also a trailer (1  minutes) for the film ""5 Against the House"". No subtitles.",1125273600,30,2864,4.970772442588727
542961,5,6303038816,"Nobody played the accused innocent any better than John Payne.  Tall and good looking, Payne exuded a quiet moral strength combined with an ability and willingness to mess it up with the bad boys whenever the situation dictated.  An Eagle Scout with a merit badge in bar brawling.

 KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL is a smart little crime drama that features Payne as the unluckiest of flower delivery drivers in motion picture history.  It seems that Mr. Big, bad guy Preston Foster, has been meticulously plotting a bank heist, and an integral part of his plan involves using an exact duplicate of Payne's truck as the getaway vehicle.  Nothing personal, John.  The bad guys don't even know you.

  Mr. Big has recruited three thugs (Jack Elam, Lee van Cleef, and Neville Brand) to pull off the heist, taking the precaution of insisting they always wear masks while in each other's presence.  That way, if things go wrong, nobody will know who his accomplices are.  For a good part of this movie the only one who has anything going wrong is poor John Payne, who is promptly fingered as one of the bank robbers.  In this movie, Payne seemingly can't walk into a room without getting pounded by some burly cop or surly con.

 KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL is briskly paced and offers enough small surprises to keep us on our toes.  Phil Karlson was a great director, under-appreciated in his time and relegated almost exclusively to B-movie duties.  KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL is one of his best.  Strongly recommended.",1097971200,57,1505,4.8352941176470585
542962,4,6303038816,"The DVD version (Gemstone Entertainment 40315) I purchased of this film noir flick (which I've never seen before) caught my eye because it featured a large close-up of Lee Van Cleef's mug, giving the beady-eyed villian top-billing.

Well, it's a trick that generic companies use to lure customers -- it worked on me. Van Cleef actually has fifth billing, but nonetheless has a substantial supporting role as one of the heavies.

This movie actually stars John Payne, a B-actor of considerable talents, whom I've only seen in one other movie, ""Miracle On 34th Street"" (he played the lawyer defending Edmund Gwynn's Santa Claus).

Payne portrays Joe, an ex-con who inadvertently gets framed for a bank heist. The plot is more Hitchcock than film noir, as it revolves around Payne dashing off to Mexico to clear his name and nail the baddies.

The cast is very solid: Jack Elam plays Pete, the man Joe gets mistaken for. Yet, even though both men's destinies collide, Pete is the real patsy -- it is his weakness that leads to his death, while fall guy Joe plays it cool and ultimately triumphs.

Preston Foster, Van Cleef and Neville Brand round out the cast, and provide a good mix of personalities to play off Payne. The only bit of unfortunate casting (as well as scripting) is Coleen Gray as Payne's love interest, who tries to get him out of the jam. It's clear that her character was written purely as a foil, to move the plot along. This, too, is more Hitchcockian than film-noir, but I would have preferred a cool dame like Ruth Roman or Peggy Knudsen in that role.

I can't exactly say it's one of the movie's flaws, but there's no ""femme fatale""; Payne draws nearer to his demise solely through the actions of evil men, not wicked temptresses.

For a B-movie, this flick has a lot of good production values: The cinematography, pacing, fight scenes and music are all excellent, though hardly quintessential of the genre. For the best examples of film noir, check out Jacques Tourneur's ""Out of the Past,"" Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity,"" Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep,"" John Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon,"" Orson Welles' ""The Lady from Shanghai"" and Raoul Walsh's ""White Heat.""

Nonetheless, this movie easily has earned its place alongside such noir classics as ""Murder, My Sweet,"" ""Johnny Stool Pidgeon,"" ""Detour"" and ""One Lonely Night.""",1094947200,5,2347,4.864661654135339
