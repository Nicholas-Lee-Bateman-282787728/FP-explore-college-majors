7796155,1,1561270733,"I gathered from the title that this was going to be a 90 minute musical exegesis on one of my favorite symphonies, perhaps something in the style of Leonard Bernstein's Norton lectures.
Not so.
First off, its part 6 of ""The Story of the Symphony"" so after some introductory remarks, Andre Previn briefly discusses ""British"" 20th century music and then conducts the Royal Philharmonic in the entire first movement from Ralph Vaughn Williams' 5th Symphony. He follows this with an example of quintessential ""American music"", the finale from Roy Harris' 3rd Symphony.
Fine albeit a bit off topic from the title of the DVD.
We're now at the 30 minute mark but hey - theres still an hour left.

Andre then gives a nice 8 min or so discussion of Shostakovich, his early life and then sets the stage for the backdrop of the composition of the 5th Symphony i.e. Stalin's Great Terror. And with that, we've finished the discussion.
Andre launches into conducting the entire 5th Symphony.
End of DVD.

So if you like watching Andre Previn conduct symphonic music on an old VHS tape played through your TV speakers, this might be a good choice for you.
If, like me, you already have some great CDs of Roy Harris, Ralph Vaughn Williams, Shostakovich and a good sound system and instead you hoped for some critical analysis of what it is exactly that makes this symphony so powerful, you're going to be disappointed.
You're better off looking for a good text. If you find one, please let me know. Unfortunately, I don't think Leonard Bernstein ever tackled Shostakovich in a lecture format.

On a minor note, the VHS release date is listed as 1997 however judging from Andre's big shirt collar, Elton John glasses and especially his hair, this has 1970's written all over it. Which is about the time he was with the Royal Phil. Couldnt say for sure he wasn't wearing bell bottoms. But he definitely looked ready to disco.",1350086400,,1908,4.723723723723723
7796156,4,1561270733,"There have been many conductors who have favored the music of Dimitri Shostakovich and have played his music at concerts and in recordings. Most of the recordings I have heard have been satisfactory, but not definitive, except for Andre Previn's recording of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony.  When Previn was in his musical prime in England he showed a mastery of Shostakovich's music.  The video that was recorded of the Fifth Symphony may not be the best example of Previn's mastery of the piece; however, it is worthwhile having in one's collection. Buy the cassette or CD of Previn's interpretation of this excellent symphony to determine how thrilling it can be if performed properly.  Maxim Shostakovich also performed his father's music with great virtuosity, understanding and love.",1034380800,6,788,5.288
