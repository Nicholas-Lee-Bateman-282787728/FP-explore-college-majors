4229407,4,B003YJ8FRY,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster and was expecting a comedy, as labeled on the box.

Surprisingly, it's more of a drama, than a comedy.  However, the story is surprisingly heart warming and feel good.

It may take multiple viewings to really appreciate this film.

Rob Schneider does a fantastic job acting in this film, far beyond the comedic roles he's known for.

In a way this reminds me of LA Story, another movie set in LA with surprisingly great story and acting.

This is not your typical Hollywood movie, and that is a good thing.  If you're in for something a little different, and genuine from a human perspective, this movie will be well worth the time to watch. And you may watch it again several times to enjoy all the subtle themes in the story.",1284854400,2,764,4.532846715328467

4229418,5,B003YJ8FRY,"I can understand why the 'critics' and pundits in Hollywood hate this film - it has humor, heart and a healing message.  We totally loved it and found it refreshingly uplifting - but not in a preachy way.

4229423,5,B003YJ8FRY,"Rob Schneider finally made a movie that doesn't suck. Though the movie doesn't quite live up to its jacket-- particularly the part about saving mankind from its own destruction-- it was otherwise pretty good. Very nice, in fact. I watched it on a whim. In general, given his previous offerings, I've learned to just skip Rob Schneider movies due to their absolute lack of any redeeming value-- or any other kind of value. So apparently somebody screwed the pooch on this one. But, you know, if this movie wasn't an accident, maybe I'll check out the next one too. Way to go Rob.",1378512000,,578,4.621359223300971

How can you make a DVD without subtitles?  I'm trying to watch movie and I can't make heads or tails when there is other noises in the room.  For quiet environments, I don't require subtitles (but prefer them).  For somewhat noisy environments, it is a necessity.",1315267200,3,278,4.729166666666667
4229426,5,B003YJ8FRY,"This movie is WONDERFUL!  It is a feel good, underdog/beat down in life guy, overcomes himself and saves the day kind of thing.  There is enough comedy in it, subtle for the most part, but funny if you catch it, and all in all I'm really pleased.  I was expecting a side splitting time.  This is not that.  This IS however a powerful tale of the human spirit, and it is for the reason, I am pleasantly surprised and happy to recommend this!",1311033600,2,440,4.253012048192771
4229427,4,B003YJ8FRY,"If you love Rob Schneider, you'll probably hate this movie. It is quiet and quaint like you've never seen him before, and there isn't a ridiculous catchphrase within 100 yards of it.

Schneider plays Paul Zadzik, an obnoxious, Elvis impersonating car salesman, a caricature of the Los Angeles success story. He has lost his way. The film begins after his fall, which is uncommon for this genre but works well here and allows Schneider to develop intricate relationships with his mother (Holland Taylor) and brother (Steve Buscemi) and convince you he is a good man with no extraordinary gifts or flaws. (Except for alcoholism which isn't given the sort of mythic glory that movies often seem partial to.)

A clumsy suicide attempt is interrupted by three wise men and a kind and sweet madonna who tell him he is their chosen one, the spiritual savior of their people. He is slowly won over by their quiet contentment which he yearns to emulate. He is at a loss for what to do with them, though, since they don't want to leave his side and are unable or unwilling to tell him how he is supposed to save them. They want him to figure this out on his own, which he eventually does through a recurring dream.

It doesn't happen this quickly or this neatly-packaged. The movie takes its time and it takes a little getting used to, especially for anyone expecting Schneider to turn into a woman, , or a male prostitute, or a dolphin.

We've seen this story before, financially successful and spiritually barren man encounters a guru/crisis/woman (this movie has all three!) who awakens them a deeper and more genuine life. But I'm not a cynic, as far as I'm concerned, they can keep doing it. When they're bad, they're harmless and when they're good they give you something you can carry with you. This isn't a religious experience, but it's a nice movie, a sweet movie, a friend who sometimes gets a little boring, but who you're happy to have around.

Buscemi plays a bitter, smoking Buddhist monk with understated brilliance. Taylor, perhaps now best known as the mother on Two and a Half Men presents a shockingly vulnerable and humane matriarch that makes her mother on Men seem like Cruella DeVille in her younger, eviler days. The interplay between the three is remarkable, especially since Schneider, as director, should take some responsibility for their performances.

Schneider's character seems to parallel the actor in many ways. Schneider as actor is known for his obnoxious caricatures. Here his protagonist has a yearning so deep, it is easy to be convinced that the yearning is Schneider's own.  He seems to want to emulate a quiet and vulnerable, early-dramatic-career Robin Williams. He doesn't have the slick and solid writing and production Williams enjoyed in The World According to Garp and Dead Poets Society, but the fact that he not only directed and starred in but co-wrote this earnest piece is a pleasant surprise. Especially when the lines he is most known for are, ""You like-a the sauce,"" ""Makin' copies,"" and ""You can dooooo it!""
I enjoyed this movie a lot and it'll remain on my list of movies to seek solace in when the obnoxious caricatures seem to be all that's survives out there.",1302048000,2,3211,4.795660036166366
4229428,4,B003YJ8FRY,Not your typical Rob Schneider movie. I liked it. I would not consider this to be a comedy. I would consider this more of a dramedy with the drama outshining the comedy.,1299801600,2,169,4.3125

I am not surprised that there is not a huge write up about it as it somewhat leaves Shneiders normal ""quirky"" rolls for a bit more serious tone.  Not so much that we don't get to enjoy alot of his normal antics.  A man does the right thing in the end with the aid of alot of great character support.

4229432,5,B003YJ8FRY,"I picked this movie expecting the usual lighthearted comedy Schneider's famous for and was surprised to get something entirely different. To tell you more about the plot, Paul (played by Schneider) is a very successful car salesman with a great future ahead of him - or so everyone thought until his wife, Christine, left him for the yoga instructor. Now, all Paul does is drink to keep his mind occupied and look for ways to kill himself.
On the fateful day he tries to hang himself, a couple of Shamans from South America ring on his door with the simple statement that he's the chosen one to save their mountain. Paul's a guy with a big heart and lets them stay in his house even though they seem to mess up with his alcohol supply. While staying with him, Paul learns a few valuable lessons about forgiveness and what is truly important in life. I won't tell you more because I'd be giving away too much plot; let's just say, this movie had its funny moments, but mostly it was enlightening with several hidden messages about the society we live in.
Schneider, who wrote and produced the movie, was perfect for the role. One could see he believed in this movie and the messages it tried to bring across. The acting was spectacular, the plot - albeit in no way action-packed - kept us all glued to our seats, laughing and crying with Schneider.
All in all, a fantastic movie and well worth the time. This is a true hidden gem, which I highly recommend.",1293062400,3,1455,4.494339622641509
4229433,1,B003YJ8FRY,"It is very rare that I consider a film to be of such poor quality that I feel compelled to review it in order to warn others, but this is exactly such a film.

Just for starters, this movie is not in any way a comedy as advertised.  I didn't laugh, chuckle, giggle or even grin once while viewing it.  It has no jokes, no clever comedic situations, not even any slapstick.  There is absurdity, such as the notion that putting a bird's nest back can literally save the Earth, but there is no comedy present in these notions because they are presented seriously.

The main character mopes around the screen half-drunk and suicidally depressed for most of the movie, but not in a slapstick or comedic manner.  Instead, he blows off concerned coworkers and passively engages in self-destructive feats such as getting drunk and pouring beer on his fire which somehow sets his living room ablaze, then he sits and watches it burn until his friend arrives and douses the flames.  After this he steals a car from work, drives home drunk, and pathetically attempts to hang himself from his bedroom rafters without actually tying the noose to the rafters.

Just as you are hoping he will successfully kill himself, some shaman from Columbia arrive at his door along with their attractive female guide (who is not really a romantic interest in the film) and he is told that he is their chosen one.  There is no comedic reaction upon hearing this news; instead he passively greets them and gives them the brush-off.  They come back, and perhaps to annoy his family he decides to let them stay at his home.

Long story short, they tell him that he must put a bird's nest back on a building in New York in order to save their dying mountain, which in turn will save the entire world.  No explanation for how this actually works is given other than the passe expression that all things are connected (which may be a nice notion but it is not a good excuse for being a lazy script writer).

Essentially, despite building situations which have the potential to develop into something of interest, in the end this film just doesn't deliver on any level.  There is no real romance.  There is no real drama.  There is no real action.  There is nothing cerebral, yet also nothing slapstick.  It is simply an empty seed.

Not only is the film devoid of both entertainment and substance, but it is wasted on a Blu-Ray as well.  The film is frequently blurry, grainy, and occasionally out of focus.  Wavy bars distort the resolution across the screen on several occasions.  The lack of attention to these detail underscores the film's overall quality.

Like most people, I too have read scathing reviews warning me from a particular movie and chosen to ignore them.  But if you do decide to buy this film, just remember; you have been fairly warned.",1291334400,5,2825,4.615230460921843
4229434,4,B003YJ8FRY,"Schneider plays the role of Paul, a car salesman with an addictive personality who degenerates into a meaningless life with no aim or hope. Paul gives up on his life and everybody he knew, and is surprised when a group of strangers visit him to tell him that he is the chosen one.
The strangers traveled a long time to find the chosen one, who will bring the whole universe to the right balance. In a state of complete disbelief, Paul tries to convince them that they are wrong and he's only a loser.
Take a gamble with your time and see if he will convince them they are wrong or if he is truly the chosen one, maybe each one of us could be the ""chosen one"" in this crazy world.

This is a more serious role for Schneider, where he shows his serious side but doesn't obscure the humor for which he is famous. This is a funny movie with a very serious and sweet message, you won't regret watching it!",1290384000,2,900,4.202312138728324

4229436,5,B003YJ8FRY,"Rob Schneider, what a great actor. This movie is not for average action flick guys or anyone wanting to have cheap comedy. This is way beyond that. It's time for awakening. If you are depressed, watch it, definitely will make you feel better. There are other things to worry about than stupid nonsense drama going everyday in life.",1287273600,2,331,4.724137931034483

4229438,5,B003YJ8FRY,"What a great movie!

Down-on-his-luck Paul (Rob Schneider) has nothing to live for...his wife left him, his boss hates him, his father committed suicide, his mother (Holland Taylor) and brother (a strange but fairly amiable Steve Buscemi) are nothing more than nuisances, and alcohol consumes him.  But when a beautiful South American woman and three shaman arrive on his doorstep, his life takes a drastic turn.

Advertised as a comedy, ""The Chosen One"" shouldn't be labeled solely as such. There are heartfelt moments, times of trial, instances of soul searching, and life lessons to be had throughout. It is more of a character study than a comedy and one in the vein of subtle drama with light-hearted humor sprinkled in for relief.

Rob Schneider has always been number one in my book. His approach isn't for everybody, but his heart is always in the right place, and his humor, while sometimes silly, is very palatable.  ""The Chosen One,"" which Rob also co-wrote and co-produced, is an exceptional movie with great acting and a very touching and moving story. If you harness and carry the understanding of compassion within your being, you will love this movie.
