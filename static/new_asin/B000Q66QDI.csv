2831700,4,B000Q66QDI,"How can you deny that God exists after watching this movie.  Proven facts that proved to me that a God exists. This movie made me a true believer. If you have doubts about religion, than this should be a eye opener.",1205020800,2,215,4.2439024390243905
2831701,4,B000Q66QDI,"Philip Gardner does a wonderful job of outlining the ways in which science and spirituality connect in this engaging film.  His unique approach encourages us to question our beliefs and assumptions, provoking much thought and interest in this complex topic.",1205020800,,257,5.425

WE HAVE A LOT OF MATERIAL TO COVER AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND. HOWEVER, IN
'QUANTUM MIND OF GOD' WE GET LITTLE MORE THAN A CARTOON WITH MONK SHANTING
AND A FEW WORDS. I HAD HOPED FOR SOME THOUGHTS OR NEW IDEAS, BUT WAS ONLY DISAPPOINTED. THE ANIMATION ARTISTRY WAS SOMEWHAT INTERESTING, YET HAD NO MEANING, AND DID NOT MEASURE UP THE THE FICTIONAL ANIMATION IN 'THE GATE TO THE MINDS EYE'. I HAVE NO PLANS TO WATCH THIS DVD AGAIN, MARC.",1199750400,5,576,4.601941747572815
2831703,3,B000Q66QDI,"What is the thread that links the Quantum to the cosmos? This documentary explores Dark Matter--""the unconscious world""--math equations, and the formations and structure of crystals in the origins of the universe. Philip Gardiner is the creator of many documentaries on symbolism, secret societies, and the paranormal. Part I to Gateways to the Other World.",1198627200,,357,5.509090909090909
2831704,1,B000Q66QDI,"I must confess that I do not know anything about Philip Gardiner prior to watching this DVD. Based on the DVD title and its tag line (""Quantum Mind Of GOD - All our questions are about to be answered""), I assumed it is a documentary about quantum physics and the cosmos, similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stephen-Hawking-s-Universe/dp/B000BITUD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stephen Hawking's Universe</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carl-Sagan-s-Cosmos/dp/B000055ZOB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carl Sagan's Cosmos</a>. Imagine my surprise when this DVD turns out to be an audio book on spirituality instead.

The video content of this DVD is halfway between 'boring' and 'annoying'. Have you ever used the Microsoft Media Player to listen to CD or MP3? Turn on its 'Visualization' option and you'll see some computer-generated images flying endlessly in your face. Now stretch it to 60 minutes and that's essentially the extend of visual you get on this DVD. Then again, it does have a hypnotic effect if you stare at it for long, and that's perhaps the whole point of the video.

The audio department is nothing to get excited about, either. The narrator mumbles in a heavy accent, against a LOUD background music. One common problem with audio books is that, unlike printed technical articles, you cannot easily check out references to the material cited, so you mostly have to rely on the integrity of the author. If you are listening to an audio book by Stephen Hawking, you can trust that he is not going to 'pull a fast one' by mixing unproven hypothesis with established scientific facts. However with Philip Gardiner, this is exactly what he is doing throughout the whole audio book.

The author jumps all over the place, freely mixing known physical phenomena (often taken out of context)  with hypothesis, science fiction ideas, and religious texts. He would often combine several disjoint theories and concepts in the same paragraph, and reads everything in a ""matter-of-fact"" tone, as if one is a logical extension of another. In fact, most of his alleged deductions all require random 'leap of logic' from one sentence to another.

As an example: the author used the following 'logic' to link the mystical power of crystal with human body:
- ""When water turns to ice it forms beautiful crystals"" [TRUE]
- ""Human bodies compose of mainly water"" [TRUE]
- ""So we are fluid crystal forms ourselves"" [Leap of logic - We are NOT frozen, and there is no such thing as 'fluid crystal'!]

Right from the start, the author mutilated the definition of 'Dark Matter' (a hypothetical matter that cannot be observed directly, but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects) as something that exist in us, but cannot be detected with conscious minds. His logic goes like this:
1. Scientists believe only 4% of mass in the Universe can be observed. The rest is called 'Dark Matter'
2. An atom is mostly empty space just like the Universe, so there is dark matter in each atom.
3. Human body is made of atoms, so your brain contains mostly dark matter
4. Therefore only 4% of your brain can be accessed while you're awake, the other 96% is subconscious that only surfaces in your dream.

The rest of this whole audio book is just the same twisted logic exercised over and over, to extend the argument over crystal, wave, DNA, ""Grand Architect"" of the Universe, ""Free Will"" for elemental particles, and so on.

In summary, there is not a shred of scientific evidence presented in this DVD about the ""Creator"" or ""Intelligent Design"". The only thing it demonstrated is that: staring at a screen saver for one hour may cause permanent damage to your brain.",1191196800,39,3770,5.219834710743801
2831705,5,B000Q66QDI,"This DVD is not just stunning in its beauty and artistic merit - it is also of profound importance to the world today. The music, images and narration are just perfectly aligned to allow one to enter the world of the Quantum Mind. The evidence brought to this documentary is stimulating, new and incredibly thought provoking. If Gardiner had the big budget bucks of the What the Bleep and The Secret he could easily reduce them to piles of shame, because this DVD is far beyond anything attempted by those productions. It does not ask you to ""realise"" monetary worth, it simply provokes you into deep thought and a contemplative mood and this reality espoused by Gardiner makes so much more sense.

I urge the world to buy this DVD - not because it is a DVD that is artistically serene, but because it holds thr truth we are all searching for - whether we know it or not.",1181952000,8,871,4.477987421383648
8194414,5,B000Q66QDI,"To know the mind of God, we must first begin to grasp how all things are connected, and what it is that connects them.  This was a very thought-provoking DVD.  What it lacks in big budget it more than makes up for in content...it made me think, and made my mind turn inward towards my own connections to the Universe.",1374883200,2,317,4.266666666666667
8194415,5,B000Q66QDI,It's great to see an indie version of things like What the Bleep. I walked away from this dvd with a great deal of knowledge not to mention inner peace.,1374883200,,152,4.1
8194416,3,B000Q66QDI,"You have to approach this documentary with a fairly open mind or chances are you won't be affected by it all. If you're expecting dramatic scenes and detailed imagery you will probably be disappointed. However, if you are hoping to find a mind-opening and thought-provoking spiritual experience complete with minimal but insightful narration and artistic and somewhat psychedelic graphics then you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will thoroughly enjoy this documentary. In terms of content, it is comparable to What the Bleep although visually it is very different. Quantum Mind of God might even make you a believer.",1294272000,,621,5.282828282828283
8194417,4,B000Q66QDI,"In this DVD we explore the Quantum Mind of God.  Talk about a film that makes you stretch your mind!  I was blown away again and again as the narrator discussed such topics as crystal energy, dark matter, and how our brain is like a mini-universe and so we are connected to the universe as a whole.  Wow!  I also love the background music which reminds me a lot of the CD Faerie Night Songs, classical tunes, and also chanting monks. I'll admit, not everyone will get this film if they're closed minded, but for those who live in possibility land filled with ""What if?"" then you'll find this to be an excellent video.  You can't help but walk away from Quantum Mind of God and not ponder your very existence and what lies beyond our own small world.",1288396800,,749,4.359712230215828
8194418,1,B000Q66QDI,"I don't know what the audio production people were thinking on this DVD.  The background music is so loud you can barely understand the narrator, who has a heavy accent which makes it that much more difficult.  There may have been good material on this DVD, but I couldn't get through it because of the annoyingly loud background music.  Total waste of money.",1264291200,2,359,4.666666666666667
8194419,5,B000Q66QDI,"What an interesting film about us, our universe and how we are connected. Quantum physics connects us to God. The universe is just like our brain so we are connected to the universe. We understand our true state of knowing but our mind is cluttered with things that don't matter so we can't use it. I am truly amazed by quantum physics and our capability and human beings.",1236124800,,372,4.485294117647059
8194420,1,B000Q66QDI,"Beware of purchasing this ""product"".
What you get is NOT a DVD but a homemade styled disk containing a wmv file featuring swirling psychedelic visuals, poor music and even worse narration. The disk will NOT play on many DVD players (on a PC it will function due to the format) - If I wanted to pay this amount of money for such a product I would just sit and listen to some real music or other narration while watching the MS Windows visualizer screen.
And the product does not explain any of this to you on the product box.
I took it back, got a refund, and the store removed the existing product from it's shelves.
Perhaps if you took the time and effort to create a proper and professional documentary then your materials might have some value.
I just wish that I had the ability to give this a -5 stars - that is what it deserves.
Purchaser BEWARE!",1231027200,5,852,4.33125
8194421,1,B000Q66QDI,"I found this to be likely designed for specific target audience groups: those who like to indulge in recreational pharmaceuticals while watching a DVD, and/or those who found books on Dianetics to be life changing.

Between the screen-saver like graphics, and the mumblings of the narrator
which were often hard to distinguish from the loud background music, it is easy to find the appeal to the former target group.

The excessive use of syllogisms, elliptical, deductive and inductive arguments make the case for its design and marketing to the latter group.

All in all, I would have to say, if you do not think you fall into one of the above groups, you would likely find better use of your time and entertainment/educational dollar.

8194422,1,B000Q66QDI,"I was very disappointed with this documentary. It's a collection of random facts and unanswerable questions. I have never seen nor could imagine any documentary that has worse graphics, narration, and background music. If you are interested in cosmology, astronomy, quantum mechanics, and ... buy a proper Discovery Channel-type documentary instead.",1217980800,12,349,5.862745098039215
8194423,4,B000Q66QDI,"I would be remiss if I did not mention the beauty and artsy vibe of this visually stunning movie.  The information expressed is yet another version of artistic interpretation.  Gardiner's questions and answers require another type of faith, one in Gardiner's ideas and research.  Worth the time and thought.",1206576000,,307,5.224489795918367
