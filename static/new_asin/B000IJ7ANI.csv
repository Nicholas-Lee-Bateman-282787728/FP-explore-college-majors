2657958,5,B000IJ7ANI,"Got my dvd in, WOW. I always thought Jewel Shepard was hot. To see her naked, and making-out is a dream come true. Best-way to descibe this movie is, 80's Emmanuelle films.",1207180800,10,172,4.40625
2657959,4,B000IJ7ANI,"There are FOUR reasons to watch this film--two of them are visible on the DVD's hard case, and two of them are covered up by a dark sweater.

Actually Jewel Shepard is a very witty and intelligent woman in real life. She has written some very perceptive and funny books, which I would recommend.

Sadly, for a variety of reasons, her career has never really taken off.

Perhaps she has been underrated BECAUSE of three of the very reasons people watch a film like this.",1179532800,7,469,4.4941176470588236
2657960,5,B000IJ7ANI,"Scream queen Jewel Shepard of 'Return Of The Living Dead' is indeed topless thoughout much of this film. They don't make 'em like they used too, an CHRISTINA is a 'jewel' of a good time.",1174521600,19,186,4.3428571428571425
2657961,1,B000IJ7ANI,"Poor Jewel. Its the kind of flick that sinks careers. She's naked or topless through more than 1/2 the movie. Her few given lines of dialogue don't do her justice. I think the minutes of nude scenes actually outnumbered the lines of dialogue.

The movie is good for a laugh in a Joe Bob Brigg's kind of way. Unless you want to watch it as a joke or are fascinated by the lovely Jewel Shepard, I'd avoid it. She had to be desperate to want to star in this flick. The movie is similar to the Emmanuelle series of movies in the late 70's shown at many drive-ins.

I purchased the DVD for around $16.00. The box said full frame. The actually DVD is Full Screen.  There's also a lot of noise of the DVD picture on my high definition TV. Looks like it was simply dubbed from a VHS tape onto DVD but it could be the equipment used in the early 80's. The DVD also malfuctions when individual scenes are selected- my high end JVC DVD player froze each time. Also at times the audio didn't appear synced to the video and was most noticable watching lips during the dialog.

There are no extras on the DVD.",1171584000,26,1095,4.22488038277512

2657963,5,B000IJ7ANI,"I think Jewel Shepard is a little hottie, but what REALLY made this movie incredibly erotic for me was that after she was captured by an organization of female terrorists, their leader (Karin Schubert) orders two of her ""female warriors"" to battle eachother with the winner getting pretty Christina as her prize!  Of course the woman who wins takes Christina back to her room, bathes her, and then takes her to bed!  Christina says she doesn't want to, but she has no choice.  She's this woman's property now!  It was NICE!!!  Later, the fighter who lost (Josephine Jacqueline-Jones) also takes possession of the pretty girl, and after Christina tries to run away she catches her and laughingly rips her clothes off so that she can enjoy that luscious body herself!  Again, Christina has no choice but to surrender to another woman's desires.  It was both kinky and incredibly hot!

Trust me, it was nice!!  It's also amazing to me how much more erotic such scenes were back in the mid-80's than they are today!  In modern films they'd simply have the women all having sex together for no reason at all, which I feel disrespects the audience.  To watch a beautiful young girl like Jewel Shepard (see DVD box cover) being actively pursued and taken by two dominant lesbian women who both want to enslave her for their pleasure was just yowzers!  This one is definitely worth checking out!",1161216000,50,1387,4.7573221757322175

2657967,4,B000IJ7ANI,"I Would Have Been happy Just To Get The cover. The Movie Is Descent. She Looks Pretty Good With Clothes On Or Off. If Jewel Was Waiting In My house Like The Cover Picture Id Never Leave Home!!  Thanks, Mike Jacobsen",1433980800,,215,4.2439024390243905

2657972,5,B000IJ7ANI,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, its 1984 production, so show me anything better in 2013. Yes, most of the movie this hot chick dress up or down, from front or back view.
Yes, she has sex about every 5 minutes or so. Yes, the movie is here to please not to offend. Yes, in real life to have similar experience I have to go to Thailand, so whats the point? Give me better idea and I will listen.",1370822400,8,379,4.0
2657973,2,B000IJ7ANI,"Bought this for nostalgia's sake as it was one of the first films I ever saw a naked woman in.  In retrospect, it's an average attempt by a poor scriptwriter to keep a very pretty woman unclothed for our viewing pleasure, but the plot is pretty infantile.  Quality of film transfer from VHS to digital is extremely low quality.  Save your money.  Jewel Shepard: if you're reading this, I still want you.",1225152000,3,403,4.555555555555555
2657974,5,B000IJ7ANI,"There are few women with the beauty and sense of humor to make a film like this not only work, but also make it fun to watch. Ms. Shepard fits the bill perfectly. She is gorgeous, and knows how to make any scene ""her own"". If you are already a fan os Jewel's, this DVD is a must; if not, you will certainly be a fan after viewing it.",1219622400,6,333,3.8405797101449277

8145702,5,B000IJ7ANI,"Let me just say, this movie is rather terrible. The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the acting is bad. Don't get this if you are looking for even a decent movie. The transfer isn't very good, so it's not blu ray quality, but I am glad to see a movie like this get released.  Get this movie if you want to see Jewel Shepard nude most of the time. I think she spends more time undressed than dressed in this. Pure eye candy. I am a fan of hers, so I truly enjoyed this performance. You see damn near every inch of her.",1493424000,,527,3.925233644859813

8145704,3,B000IJ7ANI,"Christina is a ""Paris Hilton"", a spoiled rich brat that likes to jet set. I saw Jewel in Hollywood Hot Tubs 2 way back when and never forgot her bouncing. Here we have her in a softcore movie made for her to show it all off.",1476144000,,224,3.891304347826087
8145705,2,B000IJ7ANI,"This is a curiosity, Jewel Shepard, whom is very easy on the eye, stars in this torrid tale set in the south of France. The Director clearly wanted to make a Bond film rather than a 'Skin Flick', because it concentrates more on  action, rather than erotic action.
Supposedly a classic, but I don't know why? The Blu ray image is rather good, for an eighties flick.",1470009600,,364,4.432835820895522

8145708,3,B000IJ7ANI,"I've been reading a number of the Christina books, an erotic series that ran from about 1976 to 1987.  Just recently, I learned that a Christina movie was made in the mid-1980's and I decided to see it.  Jewel Shepard has the title role and she does have a passing resemblance to the woman, or women, who posed on the book covers (the books get some product placement at the end).  However, overall, I was not impressed by the acting, the fight scenes seemed overly posed, and some of the erotic scenes were quite weird, with their use of toy cars (I suppose a psychiatrist would have fun interpreting that one).  Judging from a caption at the start, the filmmakers hoped for a Christina film franchise, but I think they were victims of bad timing as was the book series, which ended just a few years after the film.  Alas, Christina was very much a product of the Sexual Revolution and the combination of AIDS and a more conservative political climate killed that era of high decadence.",1464480000,,987,4.553672316384181
8145709,5,B000IJ7ANI,Excellent!  Plenty of Jewel Shepard!,1455667200,,36,6.2
