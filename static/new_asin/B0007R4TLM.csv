2235434,2,B0007R4TLM,"There is potential for an interesting film in Nobuyoshi Araki and his work.  The man is a dynamo and comes across as a child who has somehow figured out how to get his way at will.  Though the work is broader than Araki gets credit for, including in this film, he is mainly known for photographs that are considered art by some and exploitative pornography by others.  Don't expect to hear from the latter camp in this movie, which accepts as a groundrule that the man is a great artist but never attempts to tell us why, and which comes across as merely a publicity effort for a man already holding a black belt in self-promotion.

Various pop culture figures tell us how great Araki is, but the film never gets past the surface nor asks any probing questions.  Bjork is understandably infatuated with the lovely portraits of Araki's late wife.  But neither that relationship nor the way in which her tragic death has shaped the man are fully examined.

One model places the photographer in the tradition of Japanese shunga (erotic and explicit woodblock prints).  While there is indeed such a tradition (which, by the way, makes one laugh at the absurd claim on the DVD box that Araki is ""provoking the sexual prudery of Japan.""  And by whom was this written?  An American?), even the most casual viewer can immediately spot a clear difference; while shunga typically portrayed men and women together in erotic scenes, Araki's shots show just the woman, in a position of being dominated (with the photographer himself as the implicit dominator).  But the model's comment is not questioned and indeed this film never asks anything serious or challenging.  And its allegiance to the superficial is further underscored by its flashing of hundreds of photographs across the screen in rapid-fire succession, which only enhances the viewer's impression of these supposed works of art as cheap and disposable.

A much more interesting film about a troubled and charismatic man, his work, the controversy surrounding it, and its context in Japanese culture could have been made.  Compared with what could have been explored, Arakimentari is a mere peep show.",1136678400,22,2152,4.9088397790055245
2235435,5,B0007R4TLM,I saw this at IDFA film festival in Amsterdam and have been an Araki fan ever since. I found myself totally amazed with the filmmakers ability to depict the many personalities of such a complex man. I even teared at the end. 5 stars.,1116460800,5,233,4.318181818181818

8050793,5,B0007R4TLM,"Araki is hard to describe.  He is a photographer in love with life and living, which is an admirable trait, that few other people ever have a chance to experience.  While mostly known for his notorious photographs, his insight into what it means to be human is really at the source of his genius.",1446249600,,296,4.462962962962963
8050794,3,B0007R4TLM,Interest is probably limited to photographers. Non-photogs might find it to be slow.,1438905600,,84,5.538461538461538
8050795,5,B0007R4TLM,"If you are at all interested in Japanese artists, this is one you'll want to know about. It's really an amazing documentary and you won't regret watching it. If you are offended by nudity and sexual exploitation as social commentary, though, you should probably skip it...",1385337600,,272,4.934782608695652
8050796,4,B0007R4TLM,This is a straightforward account of Araki's work and why he takes the pictures he does. The documentary covers the many different aspects of his phots and gives insight as to why he takes the pictures he does. If you enjoy his work then I am sure you will appreciate this glimpse into his work and motivations.,1381622400,,311,4.473684210526316
8050797,2,B0007R4TLM,"There are two versions of this DVD already and I bought supposedly more explicit. I do have one of his books so I decided to have look at DVD.
The guy was lucky to be born in Tokyo and lives in Tokyo--I wish I can say this about me. His photos, in my opinion, are simple but he managed to sell and make living--good for him. As it normal all over the world government stick their nose in freedom of speech nonstop and thats the case with Araki too.
Unfortunately the conflict was not resolved. I hoped to see more about Araki connections to outside world but little was available.",1364601600,,580,4.281818181818182
8050798,5,B0007R4TLM,"Irreverent, provocative, iconoclast and genial are some of the virtues more frequent about the significance and transcendence of this emblematic artist of the camera.

This dynamic documental offers us a wide landscape about his works along four decades. The way he got to give the Japanese sexuality a true identity, beyond the prejudices, through his original and sensual images of feminine nakedness. He possesses an admirable sense of humour and good vibrations visibly contrasted around every single frame.

Bjorg, Takeshi  Kitano one of the most prestigious filmmakers, as well as other partners of the photography give overtly their opinion about this worldly icon.

A fascinating and transcendent documental that you should not miss it!",1214179200,3,744,5.5

An excellent trip into the world of one of Japan's photography GIANTS. For many years Araki Noboyushi has been constantly producing an amazing amount of work, and has literally hundreds of books to his name. He photographs everything: portraits, street snapshots, nudes, porn, architecture, himself and his life. He has said that we'd wish to be a god with dozens of arms, and each one armed with a camera.

Very interesting, fun and sexy documentary. Director Travis Klose did a great job at following Araki and giving his film good rhythm; slowing down when it was necessary, and speeding up when things need to pick up. You'll get to see Araki working in a private photo-shoot, on the street, editing his work and talking about his life and oeuvre. If you know and like this man, this is a great film to watch. The music is great too and adds a lot to the different atmospheres throughout the film.",1180915200,2,1043,5.392638036809816
8050800,5,B0007R4TLM,"What's behind a picture? What does it means? Why? The questions could go on forever. Sometimes the answer is just plain and simple. In Araki's case a man in love with photography and life. And in between, able to document everything that surrounds him without any reservations.

I suggest this documentary to anyone serious on photography and to view it with an open mind. You may agree or disagree, my suggestion is just to consider it and draw your own conclusion. Plain & simple...",1137888000,,484,4.761904761904762
