The problem is, season 2 seems to go way off the rails.  It is as if the director said, ""I want you to do the same character, but do it bigger; twice as big.""  Every bit of subtlety is lost.  I no longer care what happens to any of the characters.  Some of the plot points seem to be thrown in because the writer decides, ""We need to drama, some conflict, so here is what I have come up with.""  Whereas, the first season appears to proceed from normal character motivation; season two seems to be far more artificial.

I have not watched seasons 3 or 4 yet.  Not sure if I am going to bother to do so.

Make certain that you have a DVD player that plays this region's DVD.

The themes of adultery, infidelity, and lesbianism put this series outside the bounds that most parents set for their children.  Language warnings; theme warnings; and LOUSY second season warnings.

It is quite unfortunate that so many little comedies like this could have been easily revamped for the whole family to watch.",1501113600,,1154,4.438095238095238
8296824,5,B001E6Q0OO,I only rating this with 5 stars because I loved the show and the DVD set I had until it was stolen here in the USA.  I have no idea why Great Britian has to format everything on a tiny little island differently than the rest of most of the entire world.  In doing that it actually limits Britians more than it does anybody else here on earth.  It happened to us when we lived in Germany and would try to get video's and visual electronic items from GB.  And we couldn't give them mostly anything because nothing would work there.  It was not the difference in electrical currents because that is easily overcome in any country.  But this show was one of the greatest and so many people here in the USA and Canada would buy the set if available to watch here on our machines that run in most of the world..,1465862400,,805,4.194805194805195
