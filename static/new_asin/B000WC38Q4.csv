2964391,4,B000WC38Q4,"I watched this in ""full screen"" and I couldn't read the opening credits as they were cut off in the middle. Lacy Bond (Sondra Currie aka Linda from ""Hangover"") is a security guard at a woman's prison, who is also a police woman. During an escape, Lacy manages to prevent all but two of the women from escaping using karate kicks, while wearing a tight split skirt. When the tear gas is lobed at the good guys, Lacy is the only one who knows to crawl along the floor to get out. She does so with her butt sticking about 2 feet into the air.

Lacy is rewarded with condescending remarks by her male counterparts, remarks which she also freely dishes out. I wasn't three minutes into this film when I wanted to see her die, unfortunately this was a 70's film and I knew that wasn't going to happen. The dialouge was extremely campy and funny in retrospect. The movie is filled with sorry puns... ""We couldn't find a male to penetrate the [all female] gang."" ...""So you need a woman to go undercover?""

Lacy must go undercover to infiltrate an all girl gang run by Maude (Elizabeth Stuart). Guess where the two escapees ended up? The gang is doing armed robberies, smuggling gold, and dealing heroin.

The soundtrack was campy by modern standards. ""Peter Gunn"" style music to enhance bad chase scenes, French accordion music for love scenes, etc. Cars driving straight along the highway having squealing tires. Cars sliding down an embankment, suddenly having a rear gas tank explosion, then the hood blows off. Guys with 70's porno mustaches.

My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

If you define 'exploitation film' as a vehicle that wears a legitimate issue - such as women's equality - as a disguise while shoehorning in every demeaning cliche relating to that same issue, then you would have a pretty good example here in Lee Frost and Wes Bishop's 'Policewomen'.  Like catfights? Here they are.  Topless wome?  Ditto.  How about catfights?  Did I say that already?  Well, there are several examples of women kicking male tail too, if that's what you prefer.  And if that doesn't do it for you, there are always the catfights and topless women to look forward to.

Sondra Currie - who I must say is just a stunningly attractive woman - is officer Bond, Lacy Bond, a women's prison guard who just happens to be on duty when a break is made, and who singlehandedly stops all but two of the prisoners.  Recognizing the possibilities, the male dominated department considers Lacy for an undercover assignment - infiltrating an all-woman gang who are involved in a series of armed robberies and gold smuggling.  First she has to prove that she has what it takes though - which she does, both on and off the field.

If you don't require your exploitation to be too gritty, then this film is sort of fun in a retro-campy way.  The story is logical, if far-fetched, and the actors and actresses do a credible job most of the time - as an actress, I must say that Sondra Currie is just a stunningly attractive woman.  And despite the stream of invective that Phil Hoover as the token man in the all-girl-gang spouts, and if the topless scenes were cut, there is a distinct television feel to this film, sort of goofily innocent the way 'Barnaby Jones' or 'Ironsides' was - or, say, maybe even the way 'Police Woman' was.

This OOP Rhino release is not credited with any extras either on the product page, or on imdb, and the aspect ratio is listed at 1.33:1.  Mill Creek's Bombshell collection, on the other hand, doesn't have any extras either, but is in anamorphic widescreen, which, in my opinion, is the only way to go.  Unfortunately, you'll miss out on the excellently cool DVD cover art, which would have looked really good as a poster on my wall about 30 years ago.  My mom would have made me take it down though.",1290211200,,2663,4.904017857142857
2964393,2,B000WC38Q4,"So I too after seeing ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" wanted to check out some authentic ""Grindhouse"". I hope most of the other  movies are better than these ones!

First off. Neither one of these movies ""looks"" like a Gindhouse movie. Both have held up very well over the years and are pretty much crystal clear. Both movies have decent acting, and directing. Also the cinematography and sreenplays are decent. Mind you they're not going to win any academy awards for any of these things but they are decent. Both movies have believable plots that make sense. Sure they get a little far fetched at times but there's nothing wrong with that.

I liked ""Police Women"" better than ""Las Vegas Lady"" Police Women was a little more interesting but both films are very boring when it's all said and done. I guess I'm wondering what makes these movies ""Grindhouse"". Other than the fact that maybe they did actually open in a Grindhouse theater back in the 70's. I don't see what's being exploited in either one of these films. Police Women has minimal T&A. I think 4 quick scenes. The second film has no nudity at all. Bottom line, both these films are just BORING. I strongly recommend one of the other Grinhouse titles.",1199145600,,1215,4.668224299065421
2964434,3,B000WC38Q4,"I bought this on a whim, and, while clearly a cheapie 70's exploitation movie, it was marginally better a lot of stuff in the genre.  The movie is directed by Lee Frost, who helmed such schlocky grindhouse fare as House on Bare Mountain (1962), The Defilers (1965), The Scavengers (1969), Chaingang Women (1971), The Thing With Two Heads (1972), and most recently Private Obsession (1995).  The main character of the movie is Lacy Bond, played by Sondra Currie, who is probably better known for her TV work appearing on such shows as The Incredible Hulk, Columbo, and the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful.  The most recognizable actor in this movie would probably be William Smith who has played in a ton of movies, usually as a bad guy, and is most remembered by me as Jack Wilson in the Clint Eastwood movie Any Which Way You Can (1980).  His appearance in this movie is brief, so don't blink or you may miss it.
The movie starts out in a what appears to be a police station, but then is also a woman's prison...go figure.  Lacy is a cop, or a guard, and she's instrumental in stopping a planned escape by a number of inmates.  Two manage to get away, but Lacy's efforts do not go unnoticed by her superiors.  They pick her for an undercover mission to infiltrate a gang of women that have been committing crimes.
Before her mission starts, they put her through some training exercises, where the misogynist male cops laugh and guffaw at her, because she's just a woman, and she continually makes them look like jerks when she excels in these exercises.  The scene with William Smith, who plays a police martial arts expert, is not too bad, except maybe the end.  The martial arts work and stunts are marginally better than you might expect, and some of the fight scenes, especially between the women are downright brutal looking.
Anyway, Lacy manages to infiltrate the gang, which is run by a fairly whithered and crotchety old woman who I believe was called Ma.  Now Ma has a young boy toy (ewwwwwwwww) who also doubles as her bodyguard.  (I made the ewwwww noise as I just remembered a scene where the muscled boy toy made sexual advances towards his sugar mama and she subsequently turned him down because she had a 'headache', for which I was eternally thankful, but it just the thought of the two of them made me shudder.)
After learning about their operation, Lacy is recognized by another gang member as a cop, but she manages to shut that woman up, if you know what I mean.  Also, we learn another female member of the gang is an undercover FBI agent.  This may account for the plural form of woman used in the title, as it didn't seem to make sense, as there was only one policewoman up until that point.  Or maybe the title Policewoman had already been used...who knows.
So now both law enforcement undercover agents have been exposed, and are now being used as hostages while Ma and her gang perform their big score, involving a shipment of gold or something or other...the plot got a little messy after awhile, but this leads to a big final confrontation at the end of the movie.
Not a bad movie for what it's worth, and there are copious bits of nudity in a few scenes.  Sondra Currie is, or at least was, very easy on the eyes.  The movie is in a full screen format, and little or no extras, except maybe a trailer.  If schlocky 70's movies are your bag, then this is right up your alley.
