1716381,1,B000067JFK,"I consider myself very lucky to have become acquainted with Modesty Blaise.  Thank you, Peter O'Donnell, for Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin (my thanks are late but heartfelt, nonetheless).  My life is much the richer for your work.
This film, however, is a travesty.  Modesty Blaise could have been, should have been, bigger and better than James Bond.
Originally, I felt that the folks that made this film should be [fired].  However, I have entertained a more appropriate condemnation:
They should be required to view their abomination repetitively ad infinatum.",1036108800,4,566,5.2555555555555555
1716382,1,B000067JFK,"I bought this DVD knowing it was bad, but I was interested in the psychedelic aspects of it. I thought maybe it would have a campy ""Batman"" feel to it, being made in the same great year of '66. I was not prepared for how terrible it really is. It's so abysmal that I couldn't finish it. The acting is nauseatingly bad, the script is pathetic, and the actor's voices appear to have been dubbed (badly). I found no kitsch or camp value in it whatsoever - it's just plain awful. In fact, the back cover of the DVD pretty much admits that: the only positive thing they can say is that the movie has ""psychedelic wallpaper"". Yes, it sure does, some very groovy designs indeed, but I need more than wallpaper in a movie to keep me interested. This is one of the worst movies I ever tried to watch. It was put on DVD purely because of the then-current Austin Powers/60's fad. Although I love the sixties, I think all copies of this movie should be burned, and the DVDs made into coasters.",1029801600,7,981,4.308108108108108
1716383,5,B000067JFK,"This spoof reminds me of the Mrs. Peel black and white Avengers episodes.  There is no sex.  The women have modestly shaped bodies and wear full coverage, baggy clothes.  What little violence is of the cartoon variety.  The villains are eccentric.  The plot is preposterous. British upper class government ministers are lampooned mercilessly.  It takes several viewings to really appreciate it.",1028937600,7,394,5.377049180327869
1716384,3,B000067JFK,"Were it not for the success of Austin Powers, Modesty Blaise would almost certainly never have been released on DVD. People buying it expecting something like Mike Meyers's film will either be disappointed or pleasantly surprised, depending on taste. Both films are parodies of spy movies, but that's about where the similarities end. Powers is star-centered low comedy; Modesty is a humorless director's vision of cartoon action.
The film is genuinely funny, but in a way that may not be everyone's cup of tea. As just one of the more over the top examples, a joke late in the film depends on Dirk Bogarde's reaction to a strangled body hanging limply behind him. The moment *is* funny, but I suspect that more than a few viewers will find it anything but. The pace too is leisurely, not at all in the fist-in-the-face mode of even the early Bonds, much less more recent films in the series. In other words, expect neither childish jokes  la Powers nor fast-paced action  la Bond.
Instead, there is a lot of what pretentious critics call the ""gestural,"" which might best be described as mannerisms so showy that even academics notice. There isn't an ounce of subtlety in any of it, which seems to be the point. From Losey's overly elaborate camerawork (take a moment to figure out how the shot in the credit sequence was taken without the camera crew becoming pretzels, for example), to Richard Macdonald's eye-popping Op Art inspired production design, to Dirk Bogarde's camped up Gabriel, everyone seems to be trying to out-outrage one another.
If you are familiar with Losey's more serious work, this loud declaiming might seem out of character, but the results are as obscure and opaque as his collaborations with Harold Pinter. Still, if you normally enjoy his films, you will probably get a kick out of seeing Losey's claustrophobia turned inside out and made into a joke.",1027728000,18,1879,4.86875
1716385,4,B000067JFK,"Probably no film screams ""swinging sixties"" at you as much as Modesty Blaise does with its bright colours and pop art and op art designs, a musical score that is a blend of jazz and pop, a script that seems determined not to make sense, a campy collection of character actors, and direction that seems to have everything but direction. And yet despite all of this - or more probably because of it - the film remains oddly entertaining. And it is definitely a reflection of the era in which it was made. Some of us may watch it with twinges of nostalgia mixed with embarrassment. To say the style of the film is dated is to state the blindingly obvious. But that's part of its charm.
If you are willing to dispense with logic and enter into the spirit of the film, the experience can be quite good fun. Based on a popular comic strip and released at a time when every other film was about spies, Modesty Blaise refuses to take itself, or anything else, seriously. Monica Vitti - always a strange choice for the role - is seldom made up to look like the character she is portraying. Terence Stamp, as her sidekick Willie Garvin, seems to be having a great time. Other British stalwarts such as Clive Revill and Harry Andrews happily do their bits. But it falls to Dirk Bogarde and Rosella Falk to go as far over the top as the film's mood and style requires. Falk in particular seems to have realised exactly what was called for by director Joseph Losey.
But it is Dirk Bogarde who carries things along and whose performance will be most remembered. It is a performance for which the word ""camp"" might have been invented. With hair, makeup, costume and body language suitably outlandish, he wisely counterpoints them by dryly delivering his dialogue with his trademark underplaying. Only Bogarde could be staked out in a desert and desperately call out: ""Champagne...champagne...""
In the end, you almost wonder why Bogarde and Losey made this film, which is such a distinct change of pace from their earlier collaborations. Some of the sequences are brilliantly shot, especially the more realistic Amsterdam scenes early in the film. But having Vitti and Stamp bursting into song was a huge mistake.
Like most cult films, Modesty Blaise is an acquired taste and will not appeal to everyone. Fans of sixties excess will love it and admirers of Dirk Bogarde will be amazed by it. Anyone watching it for the first time are advised to keep an open mind.",1026432000,10,2447,4.640552995391705
1716386,5,B000067JFK,"This movie is nearly ruined by the two leaden performances by its lead stars (Stamp almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie!!).  What save this and turns it into a glorious romp are the performances by Dirk Bogarde (yes, heavy drama Dirk!! with white blonde hair!!!!!) and Clive Revill doing camp in high style.  Their to-the-wall campy characters are alone worth every penny of this.  They are a riot as the mad menancing boss and his competitive right hand.  Bogarde and Revill have a fine grasp of what camp should be, unlike the two leads that seem alternatively to take it serious (big mistake) or seem rather ashamed to be caught in this off-the-wall, odd ball film. Heavily weighed down by mod 60's culture (which Austin Powers now makes a fortune with), it obviously was ahead of its time!!!!
So pop some popcorn and ice the pepsi, and maybe buy you a big box of JuJu fruit, click back and enjoy.  People that enjoy Austin Powers series of films, will go for this BABY!!!!!!!!!!",1026345600,12,990,4.634285714285714
1716387,1,B000067JFK,"It's too bad that spoofs of the James Bond films tend to be so very bad. Both print and television have done quite well making hip fun of Bond and his imitators, but movies made with the same idea consistantly come up short. Some of them are a lot of fun, even if they don't hold together. Some are completely unwatchable. Modesty Blaise comes somewhere in the middle. It isn't actually revolting, but it's nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.
  Fans of the Modesty Blaise comic strip and novels should avoid this film like the plague. This isn't Modesty, or Willie, any more than the Matt Helm films are adaptations of the Matt Helm books. People unfamilliar with the other Modesty material may find this film mildly enjoyable, but would be better off with the Flint movies, which come as close as anything ever done to making a success of this idea.",1026086400,10,857,4.52258064516129

It was meant to be a wild, psyched-out Swingin' Sixties romp, but it's completely witless and humorless, listless and sodden. It's not a good sign when your mind is wandering before the end of the opening credits. The acting is abysmal, except for Dirk Bogarde's prissy bad guy, and the writing is indecipherably nonsensical. I'm giving it two stars only because it's sort of fun to see the wacky Pop Art set designs and hear the lovably awful Swingin' Sixties music. To see this sort of thing done much much much MUCH better at the time, see Marcello Mastroianni in ""The Tenth Victim"" or the first of the two Flint movies.",1425600000,,718,4.530769230769231

1716511,2,B000067JFK,"During the ""Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" craze, I had high hopes that in theaters something wonderful might transpire across movie screens and a female superspy may make it as a spy spoof.  The movie is a spoof, and while theatrically the money and talent is there to make the picture, but they forgot to put the soul in the picture.  Perhaps it was in the writing of the script by Evan Jones and a lot of the credit for the failure of the picture to connect is famed director Joseph Losey (""Accident"", ""The Servant"", ""Secret Ceremony"", ""The Go-Between"").  All the talent is wasted in his hands.  Monica Vitti and Terence Stamp, who really have a chemistry together, and the villians Dirk Bogarde and Rosella Falk are embroiled in wallpaper and mod clothes.  It is all too droll and rarely comes alive.  There is really little reason to watch it except to see it and that does not say much for it.  John Dankworth's music is exceptional and adds a great deal to an otherwise empty film.  Novelist Peter O'Donnell did help write the original story based on the comic strip he wrote with Jim Holdaway.  It's just a vacuous exercise in tedium and style without any life to redeem it.",1371513600,,1173,4.574162679425838

I think I know why they did it, the film Cleopatra cost them so much money to make they didn't have any left to film their own movies when the ""Mod"" crazy hit big in the 1960's so they took a chance and bought this crap from overseas.

1716515,2,B000067JFK,"I am a fan of films made in this time period.  A friend of mine, from England, spoke of Modesty Blaise and how exciting she found this character.  Unfortunately I found out that Ms. Blaise's life began in books and not a movie, AFTER, I had bought this film.

From the first scene, I knew that the plot would be thin as prosciutto, and that I would struggle to understand the actress' words.  But Ms. Vitti has so much presence, I thought it would recover.

After ENDURING the film to the end, I discovered that this film is beautiful to look at....the camera shots, the scenery (the monastery where Gabriel and gang ""hide out""....Amsterdam), the costumes (many of you probably disagree but I love the hair and clothes, especially Modesty's evening coat with the holes...gonna have that made).

Stereotypes run rampant here, especially with Modesty's ""father"" the Sheik and the villain (I was never once terrified) Gabriel, but I rather loved the men from the British government.  I think I get who Willie Garvin is supposed to be, but Mr. Stamp makes his character come off like a meth-addled porn star....

I can see Monica Vitti as some alluring star of the Italian cinema but let me reiterate what the other reviewers have said and say that she is woefully miscast here.

But for me, the music, clothes, sets, locations are enough to entertain me once in a while and inspire some dressing and decorating and vacation choices.

I will take this film out, once every few months, and be thinking of just that.",1294617600,,1510,4.6856060606060606

Aside from Danger: Diabolik, I've never see a movie like this one. Neither star can speak English clearly (Monica Vitti with her thick Italian accent and Terence Stamp with his thick Cockney accent) and there are no redeeming characters.

The plot revolves around boxes of diamonds which everybody wants to steal. Sort of spy-thieves. The main selling point is seeing the beautiful Monica Vitti wearing various nightgowns in exotic locations and swank bachelor pads.

Definitely a product of it time (1965-1967) and is very colorful.

Modesty Blaze is here played as a silly vain woman, not as a world-wise leader of men, her side-kick looks too weak to lift his own luggage and their government contact is a twit.  It's intended to be hip, 60's pop-adelic 'like wow man' but it is simply a reminder of how self-indulgent and lame most of that was.",1234310400,3,430,4.430379746835443

When I watched the film later on, I couldn't believe how bad it was. For those that are thinking about buying this movie on DVD, DON'T! It is as of now the worst 60's movie that I have ever seen and there are enough holes to fill swiss cheese. The thing that really kills me is that Monica Vitti (an Italian actress who-hello!-is playing a British spy) changes her hair from black to blond and back again; as if we have two Modesty Blaises. Also of note I couldn't see most of the opening credits as it surrounded by a pop title song! (that seems to be modeled later by ""Barbarella"" which was based on a comic book like this one) The movie may be 119 minutes long but it drags on and on. In conclusion, this is one that you shouldn't bother.",1144972800,6,912,4.100558659217877
1716560,3,B000067JFK,"I saw ""Modesty Blaise"" in the cinema when it was first released in 1966. At that time I had already read the book, which I loved, and I came away from the cinema thinking that this travesty, this blasphemy of a movie was total trash.

Peter O'Donnell, the author of the book and the comic strip that inspired the movie, went on to write a whole series of books about Modesty Blaise, and I loved them all, especially the first five - six of them, after which the series declined somewhat. I became a greater and greater fan of Modesty Blaise, and my memory of this movie remained completely negative.

Why this negativity? Because the movie does not follow the true concept of Modesty at all. The Modesty books are intelligent and exciting and character-driven, with a touch of humor. In particular, the characters of Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin (Modesty's loyal side-kick) and their unusual relationship are key factors in the books.

This movie, on the other hand, is just plain silly. It's ""campy"", with all of the characters acting strangely and with everything that is done being exaggerated. Modesty and Willie, who are both poorly cast relative to their appearance and physique as described in the books, even break into song a couple of times!

So as a movie depicting the ""true Modesty Blaise"" this movie deserves one star, even though the script does actually follow the first book to a large extent, although everything is modified a bit one way or another.

Now I've watched the movie again on DVD, and my opinion is less harsh.

If you take the point of view that this isn't a Modesty Blaise movie, but a Joseph Losey movie, then it isn't all that bad. Joseph Losey (the director) did have a specific idea of what kind of (campy) movie he wanted to make, and by gum, he did make it.

""Modesty Blaise"" (the movie) lasts all of two hours, and the style is consistent and sure. Everyone acts consistently silly, the plot is silly, the action is silly and even the theme song (although catchy) is silly. So if you're in the mood for a silly, campy movie, you've come to the right place.

In fact, if I was a fan of campy movies then I might be giving this movie four or five stars. But I'm not, so I'll leave it at three stars. But it does deserve that simply for the consistent weirdness and for the song ""Ice is Nice"", sung by Bob Breen. (There's actually a sound track CD available!)

Incidentally, there is no extra material on the DVD, although it does include sound tracks in English, French and Spanish.

Over the years there was often talk of a new Modesty movie, and finally in 2003 ""My Name is Modesty"" was made and released directly to DVD. Comparing this movie with ""My Name is Modesty"" (which I also give three stars) I can say that the big difference is in the intention.

""Modesty Blaise"" (the movie) was not intended to be a true Modesty movie, so it fails if that is what one is looking for. But it succeeds fairly well in what it was attempting to be, namely a campy movie.

""My Name is Modesty"", on the other hand, really was trying to be a true Modesty movie, so it simply fails.

We true blue Modesty fans are still waiting for a good Modesty movie.

1716562,4,B000067JFK,"Though this is not a knee-slapper as satire, and certainly no thrill-giver as an action flick, this film has aged better than Bond films like Thunderball, generically speaking the ground of this satire.  Modesty Blaise is loosely based on a comic-book super-heroine and played by Monica Vitti. The humor is very droll, yet needle-sharp in its mockery of the amorality of empire and espionage, and in its parody of the conventions of the action-hero movie, its mad-camp villain, its tools, its blue waters.  It hits its dry humorous notes and jazzy visual chords without pedantry, seeming very British and looking very Italian, a nice trick. Stoned in a rather stately way, and head-scratchingly complex in places, this movie is shrewd enough to avoid the utter silliness of many 60s movies. The film is visually beautiful and engaging, with grand colors and compositions with lots of space and depth: the toughest thing about Modesty Blaise is that it moves at a pace more like an Italian sex-and-class study than an action movie or typical spoof; indeed, the film freely recalls Antonioni's L'Aventura, (which also starred Vitti), especially in its Mediterranean location shots. And after all else is said, Monica Vitti remains an absolute stunner here, a true movie star, with a face of a thousand shades of tenderness and cunning. She also has great hair that changes about every five minutes. (Her hair itself is a better actress than Madonna.)  Vitti and her sidekick, Terence Stamp, a mod Adonis, have a cool chemistry, and even sing in one pleasantly bizarre scene. Dirk Bogarde, the villain, is in a role unlike any other he ever played, but he may steal the movie. This is an anomaly: a rocknroll movie--droll, nonconformist, and hip--with almost no rocknroll in the soundtrack.",1108771200,43,1787,5.030405405405405

Terrible movie, totally confusing, and a script that was most likely contrived over numerous doses of LSD. However, I was quite taken by two things: (1) Terence Stamp and (2) the scene where Modesty peels the false skin off Willie Garvin's back to reveal all those tools and gadgets. When I discovered there was actually a book to read that might explain all I had seen, I jumped on it. The book, unlike the film, was wonderful, and Peter O'Donnell's stories only improved from the first novel right up until the final Modesty Blaise book was published 6 or 7 years ago. I cannot recommend this movie but I can and do urge you to go to your library (the most likely place you will find a Modesty Blaise book) and get the books, particularly the ones called ""I, Lucifer"" and ""A Taste for Death.""

The cast is sort of chi-chi: Monica Vitti, Terence Stamp, Harry Andrews, Dirk Boarde and Clive Revill, with Jospeh Losey directing, (Joseph Losey??) A hoi-polloi audience was almost assured! I saw this film in 1966 when it came out and was immediately struck by how different it was from the other Bond spoofs, such as ""Our Man Flint"" and those awful Matt Helm movies. ""Modesty"" is avant garde in that notoriously sanitized, late sixties style that made psychedelia palatable for the masses, with op art wallpaper everywhere and decadence celebrated by way of the villains portrayed by Bogarde and ""Mrs. Fathergill"".
The jazzy score is very reminiscent of the one for ""The Tenth Victim"", though the lyricked theme song used in the opening credits should do WITHOUT the words, since they're just a WEE bit too arch! The instrumental side, however, is done beautifully, and adds to the ""chic"" feel of the movie.
The fact that Monica Vitti has an accent so thick, you could choke on it, only adds to this flavor, as does Terence Stamp's prophetic ""Alex the Droog"" portrayal of her sidekick, Willie Garvin. The casual use of Ferraris, Rolls Royces, Citroens and multi-colored cigarettes make this a fashion-mongerer's wet dream.
It's been stated that this film had no plot....oh, it's got a plot, alright, but there's so much OTHER business going on while it's unraveling, you can miss it! Modesty and Willie's briefs are to make sure fifty million pounds of foreign aid, in the form of diamonds, are delivered to an arab sheikh without the inimitable Gabriel, (Bogarde,) getting his superciliously foppish hands on them. Revill plays his fawning sidekick, accountant and condifante, McWhorter.
Everybody involved seems to be having the time of their lives being in this flick, especially Stamp and Vitti.
Chic, funny, and unique, a DEFINITE change of pace for the classic Hollywood director who helmed it, (if he indeed ever existed)....this movie joins ""Help!"", ""Lord Love A Duck"" and a few other zany flicks as icons of sixties aesthetics and cinematic philosophy.
A museum piece of late sixties culture....
(Why ...does she have to be called ""Modesty Blaise""?? How about ""Modesty Ace"" or ""Modesty Aqua""?)",1057536000,9,2273,5.015873015873016
1716565,1,B000067JFK,I am a real fan of parody and was hoping this film would fit the mold. Nope. It was boring and a waste of time. The Flint movies were superb - Fathom was acceptable.  This is the first DVD I bought that I gave away after watching it (and I have a large collection of 1950 Sci Fi bad movies!). Don't bother renting or buying this DVD.  It is a waste of money to do so.,1049932800,7,367,3.8157894736842106
1716566,4,B000067JFK,"MODESTY BLAISE is an enjoyable, campy little gem that is quite fun.  High in style and low in plot, the cast obviously had a ball working on this great film.
Based on the popular long-running comic strip character, the story concerns high-class jewel and art thief Modesty Blaise (played bewitchingly by Monica Vitti) who is called upon to investigate the actions of reclusive millionaire and criminal Gabriel (Dirk Bogarde) who lives on a foreboding island.
Modesty enlists the help of her associate and some-time lover Willie Garvin (Terence Stamp) and soon Modesty is up to her neck in psychedelic espionage and sexy costumes!  However, there is always Gabriel's assistant to contend with: the man-eating, sadistic Mrs Fothergill (Rosella Falk)...
The plot is as wafer-thin as Modesty's silken dresses; between the time that Modesty is recruited to the final showdown on Gabriel's island, there is about 90 minutes of plot that I cannot even fathom.  Dirk Bogarde relishes his role as the decadent Gabriel, wearing a John Inman-esque fright wig and drinking out of impossibly-sized glasses.  Another hilaious scene is where Mrs Fothergill is holding ""diving lessons"".  During the climactic battle, Modesty and Willie have a time-out to sing a rather annoying love song, and somehow Arabs on stallions are mysteriously transported to the island to assist Modesty in her showdown with Gabriel!!...Totally unbelievable and only possible in the 60's.
Nontheless, MODESTY BLAISE is a charming piece of fluffy eye-candy and should be savored as the harmless schlock that it was meant to be.
Highly recommended.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1036713600,6,1643,5.348837209302325

7963136,1,B000067JFK,"This is a terrible adaptation of Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell thought this was a rotten rendering of his Blaise books. I'm a great fan of all the Blaise books but this movie is sometimes painful to watch. I'm also a big fan of Monica Vitti, and Dirk Bogarde, but this is a remarkably bad use of their talents. Not even a good sendup. The best thing about this DVD is the cover art. To see a more faithful film version of the O'Donnell books, see ""My Name Is Modesty.""  Although it's low budget, it's much more enjoyable for fans of the books than is this version.",1508371200,,566,4.339622641509434
