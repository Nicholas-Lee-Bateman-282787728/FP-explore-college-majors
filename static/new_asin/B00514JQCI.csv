8452269,3,B00514JQCI,"One sees President Obama briefly at the beginning and end of this doc.  It doesn't go more into his life than that.  This work does not explain who a Kansan and Kenya fall in love in the last state.
This is the type of doc that a news channel would make.  It doesn't have the quality of what one would see on PBS or the History Channel.
I thought this would start with World War II and all the Black soldiers that arrived on the islands then.  However, it practically goes back to Captain Cook.
The work tries to be diverse in terms of profession.  You do see singers and veterans here.  However, I did think the work dwelled a little more on the elite (e.g., doctors and lawyers) than it should have.
Since Obama's rise, everybody has heard the contested term ""postracial.""  One may think that Hawaii is soooo diverse that Blacks would easily be accepted here.  Luckily, the work shows something more complicated.  While the doc shows Blacks who love the state immensely, many say there is anti-Black racism there.  Some of the figures discussed in the work eventually returned to the Mainland due to racism in the Pacific.
Hawaii supposedly has a HUGE percentage of multiracial residents.  One woman of Black and Asian descent is interviewed.  What was really diverse was seeing a Black musician who had been adopted by either a Polynesian or Asian family.  Still, I do think they could have shown even more multiracial Blacks than present.
People who enjoy this doc should also read Beth Bailey's book ""The First Strange Place.""",1349049600,,1531,4.667910447761194
