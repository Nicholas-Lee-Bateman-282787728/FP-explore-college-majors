8238703,3,B0010VUTMM,"O.K..... But! With the aid of hindsight I must admit I would not part with my hard earnt to buy this DVD.  Why?  Whilst some of the initial information provided was worth while and important to the un-educated, the further the DVD went on, the more the information appeared to be merely filling. That is to say useless information to the point the last forty odd minutes or so is about some sidecar outfit, some no body built and his problems and on and on and on.  I am sure there is someone, somewhere in the world interested in this,but they should have made the one DVD just in case this ONE person ever thought to but it! Sorry Hans but quality not quantity is the answer.",1276387200,18,677,4.31496062992126
8238704,2,B0010VUTMM,"Well at least we have motorcycle videos to choose from now...even if it looks like my Uncle Bob shot and edited the video. The video is somewhat informative, but his accent, video quality, and lack of documented lists are distracting to it's quality. In regards to the last comment...here's one example...he says he is going to share his tool set with you and lays it out in front of himself and proceeds to talk about it for 1 minute and then moves on to great products from his sponsors. Did you get all that?! Ahhhh...being that I paid for the video could you have a screen list that I could freeze-frame on; or a printed document? Or is specifics going to be covered in the book (rolls eyes). I bought this video to learn from a pro...so would I buy another of his quality videos? Simply...no.",1209686400,24,797,4.465753424657534
