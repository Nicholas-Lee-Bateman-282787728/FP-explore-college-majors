8105166,3,B000E3LCZU,"This DVD is a very basic, superficially informative picture of life of the different classes in England during the reign of Queen Victoria. It seems to have been filmed with the idea of teaching children of school age about how England moved forward into a different age...plenty of drawings to illustrate different lifestyles, poverty, inventions etc., with a narrator to explain. It actually put me to sleep in spite of my interest in history and the Victorian age. One actor did a fine job of quoting from a portion of Charles Dickens but other than that, it was pretty dull.",1431993600,,578,4.79
8105167,3,B000E3LCZU,"If you don't already know much about the victorian Era, The DVD ""Living In the Past: Life in Victorian Times"" may hold some interest for you, it's not in depth - But I received it in good time and condition and for a good price. This is a reliable seller The rating is for the DVD not The seller - The seller gets 5 stars for their part - Thank You",1380153600,,348,3.915492957746479
8105168,2,B000E3LCZU,"I bought this film for my high school senior English students as background information for our novel study of Great Expectations. Normally, I have students read and take notes from their text, The Language of Literature, as a prelude to studying the literature of a time period. However, with ""senioritis"" kicking in, I thought a documentary film would be a more engaging activity. Although it does not take much to put seniors to sleep, this film was difficult to stay awake for. The sound quality, when it came to the interviews (centered mostly on one expert), was poor. The excerpts from Dickens were extremely long and would have benefited from caricatures or illustrations instead of presenting a monologue by a narrator. Above all, their text introduces a wider range of issues and knowledge. After viewing the film, students took away little from the full picture of life in Victorian times.",1359244800,,900,5.006666666666667
8105169,3,B000E3LCZU,"The more complete title is ""Life in Victorian Times IN ENGLAND.""  This starts with Queen Victoria's birth/coronation and ends with her death.  Her title of ""Grandmother of Europe"" never comes up.  The work emphasizes Charles Dickens and never mentions Emile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, or other writers on the Continent.  In a similar fashion, I had been taught that the Victorian age ended because of Freud, Marx, and World War I; again, this work says it ended with the Queen.

The film ""Titanic"" has been praised because it spoke about the upper class and the poor on the vessel.  Similarly here, this work describes the lower, middle, and upper classes in Britain.  It's easy for me to think that the Victorian age was marked by privilege and thus they wasted time on frivolous things, somewhat like how Americans wasted money on Beanie Babies in the successful 1990s.

Unfortunately, there is scant mention of women and gender.  The women's studies that I read suggested that Victorian women were praised, and restricted, for doing frou-frou, superficial stuff.  The work only briefly refers to the Victorian age as a time of peace, almost a ""pax britannica.""  Though empire is mentioned, the racism and regionalism that empires practice does not come up at all.  Michel Foucault's repressive hypothesis never comes up either.

There was a modern, female scholar interviewed here that I appreciated.  She said something to the effect of:  ""The age was a time of invention and radical change.  We moderns would have trouble surviving in the start of the era, but would probably do okay by the end of it.""  There is an actor interpreting Dickens and I thought his performance just killed time.

This work can be seen as scant or cursory.  However, it would be an excellent viewing piece for high school history and English classes.",1174348800,10,1829,4.937704918032787
