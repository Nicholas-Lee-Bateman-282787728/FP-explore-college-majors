8712696,3,B00WAKLJ58,"""Aelita"" (1924) is based upon a novel by A. Tolstoy Produced, in the U.S.S.R (founded in 1922.) The movie is set at the beginning of the NEP (New Economic Policy) in December, 1921. The version I watched has English titles by Kyril Dambueff and Mark Bennett. Really annoying piano music by Alex Rannie.

On December 4, 1921 at 6:27 p.m. Central European Time, radio stations on Earth received a strange signal. It is intriguing to see all the instrumentality of the deciphering office. The speculation on Mars is Sort of the first X-files.

Loss (a scientist that is obsessed with going to Mars) imagines a Mars with Aelita (Yuliya Solntseva,) a vamptress with a fascination with fascinators (a form of head gear.) ""Touch my lips with your lips as those people on Earth did.""

Mean while back on Earth his wife, Natasha (Valentina Kuindzhi) seems to have a thing going with their new male squatter.

We have a natural blend of politics and space (or Loss's imagined Mars.) I will not go into detail. However you will need to watch this film to be culturally savvy.",1442707200,3,1064,4.704301075268817
