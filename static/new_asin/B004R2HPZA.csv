8438652,4,B004R2HPZA,"Garv is a story of three brave, honest and dutiful cops Arjun Ranawat, Samar Singh and Haider Ali Khan. Samar Singh wants the state to be a crime free state with the help of encounter specialist Arjun Ranawat and Haider Ali's team force. But they can't help him because the powerful politician Kashinath Trivedi, Yeshwant Pandey etc. made the state corrupted by staying connected with the underworld don Zafar Supari. Salman's role as a serious encounter specialist Arjun Ranwat is a good ingredient of the movie. After a long long time Salman figured out himself in such a serious role with no-nonsense manner, which previously he made habit in David Dhawan's directions. He could have become a good role model for the entire policemen if the movie did better than a below average (as per box-office report) outcome. But Shilpa Shetty's role here seems out of requirement as she had no much role to impress the audience just than a bar dancer and later a housewife. Last but not the least, Garv walks in the same route to Sarfarosh but the carriage is not as strong and normal as the latter one.",1304035200,,1096,4.713541666666667
