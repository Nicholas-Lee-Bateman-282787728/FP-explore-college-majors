This title is carefully manufactured and shipped by its videographer and editor, Mr. Paul Gittelsohn, d.b.a. VideoSyncracies.
It is my understanding that 50% of all profits from the sale of this item are donated to the Ukulele Hall of Fame Museum which was the initial reason for its production.
A worthwhile cause and typical Tiny Tim kindness.
Very informative and educational, Tiny had encyclopedic knowledge of the ukulele and the artists who worked with it.
He was a talented historian with rich life experiences as related to him by the actual artists themselves and all are illustrated here with high quality photos and print media. He has so much enthusiasm and love for the subject matter it warrants a few viewings to take it all in!
This truly is Great Fun and very enjoyable.
I would very much like to have an expanded version with complete outtakes as extras.

I regret the recording industry did not take better care of Tiny. His efforts were worthy of much more promotion.

I would also like to recommend the DVD-R release Tiny Tim: The Last Hurrah and one of my absolute favorite CDs, God Bless Tiny Tim which is a timeless and joyful experience!

Tiny Tim was a genius and the evidence is overwhelming.
Beyond unique, he was his own creation and gave thanks to God for making it possible. Impressive.

I love Tiny because He loved Life and passed it on to everyone else.

A natural comedian, musician, performance artist and Authentic Human Being.

God bless Tiny Tim indeed.

He's a delight on this listening to him talk about and playing numbers from the crooners of yesterday.  You can tell in this DVD Tiny was definitely in his element.  That big, beautiful smile of his shines throughout.  I wish I had appreciated the talent of this kind, gentle, beautiful performer a lot sooner.",1440720000,,471,4.224719101123595

8456755,4,B0054K8X46,Difficult to find Tiny Tim DVDs.  My dad wanted one which had him singing and of course playing his ukulele.  Pleased with arrival time and product.  Thank You,1396137600,,159,4.607142857142857
8456756,5,B0054K8X46,"If the 64 year old ""Eternal Troubador"" was ailing at the time, it's very hard to tell, as he gracefully guides us through the History of the Ukelele and its' champions, most notably Gene Austin, Rudy Vallee, Bing Crosby, and Russ Colombo (I'm not clear if Russ strummed the four-string).

As always, Tim is fast on his feet (tip-toes) jumping right into many melodies he ""channels"". He does some or alot of: My Blue Heaven, Where The Blue of the Night Meets The Gold Of The Day, My Time is Your Time, et. al. He's in very good voice and the instrument is taut and tune-y.

Interesting to see him hold onto his Russ Colombo tribute CD and express his satisaction with that project. I had the pleasure of interviewing The Artist Formerly Known As Darry Dover (Tiny Tim), in 1982 and 1985, and I encountered the most self-critical artist in the world.

38 minutes of Tiny Tim. Just the man, his music, and  bookstore shelves as a backdrop.

Excellent stills of artists and their original sheet music, including one filmclip. Maybe that day in '96, Tiny was also feeling the spirit of the great Show Business Historian and Host, Joe Franklin, also from ""dear New York""?",1333152000,3,1165,4.608695652173913
8456757,4,B0054K8X46,"Tiny Tim's last moments caught on film a few months before he passed away.
Telling great stories of his favorite singers , sang bits of the songs
And history of the ukulele and why he loves to play it.
Only bad part is the dvd is too short only 38 minutes.
Kinda wish is was longer. Still a must have in your collection!",1321056000,,320,4.095238095238095
