8572766,4,B0076D09WI,"First of, this is a low budget indy. Attenuate your expectations.

As a low budget indy, it was entertaining. The plot is simple and straightforward but the main and my man Phil the Pizza Delivery Guy carry the movie. More of Phil would have been awesome. I literally had to pause the movie to give myself time to stop laughing at his reaction to the spatula. That alone was worth the watch. The beginning is a little slow and the twists a little too obvious but enjoyable.",1499990400,,473,4.436781609195402

8572768,1,B0076D09WI,"Cheaply, badly made low budget badly acted movie (must have been shot on an iPhone) with a totally obvious script if  you could call it that. No need to  watch it at all!",1489449600,,170,4.121212121212121
8572769,3,B0076D09WI,I'm not sure why I want to use the word cute but it was humorous and the main character was so likeable. I enjoyed it. It was good for being low budget. I will never look at a spatula the same again,1481846400,,198,3.738095238095238
8572770,2,B0076D09WI,Too low budget for me. Seemed like an expanded student play. Kudos for the decent audio quality and the video wasn't bad either. At least no shaky cam in this low budget foray.,1472601600,,176,4.363636363636363
8572771,3,B0076D09WI,"Definitely low budget, but over all not too bad.",1467417600,,48,4.444444444444445
8572772,5,B0076D09WI,"If A is Avengers, then Wireless could be a C, but, viewed and graded as a frugal film indie, Wireless connects with notable high points, which I enjoy when watching. Its also true this movie has its dips, for example an early coffee shop scene is a little bumpy, but I encourage you to watch on. Youll be rewarded with a well-structured story, good humor, with running jokes, and a talented performance by the lead actor, who is believable in his part as John Jenkins and geniunely funny and entertaining throughout and supported by other cast members' performances. Though an apparent low-budget independent, there is a night scene, lit fantastically, that looks rich. That impressive image sticks with me. Its simply a 5-Star shot.",1450224000,,733,4.919354838709677
8572773,5,B0076D09WI,"Just watched this movie for the second time after a couple years and was impressed by how well it stood up. Its built on a clever premise and has both the charms and chinks of an independent film. Although its not very scary, Wireless contains all the elements of a thriller that work well together including suspenseful build-up, comic relief, plot twists, character growth, an original score, and a fantastic lead actor. Looking forward to more films from Matthew 13 Productions.",1450137600,,481,4.950617283950617
8572774,3,B0076D09WI,"Let's be honest.  This is a no budget movie in every sense of the phrase.  That's not an insult, it's just the truth.  This ain't Avatar, nor did it have, even the equivalent of, one day's coffee budget on Avatar, or it's own coffee budget for that matter.  This movie was obviously made with a DSLR, local talent, and whatever locations were available.  Those things need to be said upfront if you're thinking about paying for this title.  However, those things being said, there is some fun to be had with this little movie.  If you're looking for any kind of Hollywood production value, this movie is a definite pass.  However, if you're willing to risk a couple of bucks to encourage an aspiring filmmaker, and are curious to see what true no budget film making can look like, you may just find this movie worth the money.  It may not blow your socks off, but if you go into it with the right mindset, it could very well be worth your while.  That's my two cents, anyway.",1360022400,5,975,4.426966292134831
