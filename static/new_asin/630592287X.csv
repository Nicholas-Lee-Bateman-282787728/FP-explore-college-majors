8167941,1,630592287X,"At roughly one hour into 'Silicon Towers', the main character, having been set up by the Evil Company and detained by the police he went to for help, is bailed out by the same Evil Company and is menaced by Al Sapienza (head of Evil Company security) in a limo as they drive back to Evil Company HQ. The main character says, ""You can't just make this disappear. There are witnesses; Detective Green."" Sapienza responds, ""Detective Green... every woman has a price."" Detective Green, by the way, is portrayed by Robert Guillame, whom I remember most clearly from Sports Night. He is a black male. Unmistakably. However, there's a subplot in the film about Sapienza's character being in cahoots with the main character's sleazy, money grubbing girlfriend, and at this point in the film the main character has just discovered this. So he'd definitely bring it up. You see? The line was an editing snafu from a part of the conversation that didn't make it into the final cut. A really, really bad one. And that's just one out of literally DOZENS of horribly edited dialogue/shot sequences. There are possibly over a hundred legitimate errors in the editing. And that's just one example of why this is one of the worst and most boring, painful, NOT so-good-it's-bad movies I have ever seen. This movie sucks. Brian Dennehy, Guillame and my hero Brad Dourif together could not redeem this dreck. It is bottom of the barrel cinematic garbage, and I worry what it says about me that I quit after tweny-four minutes of excruciatig pain and then came back for the rest determined to see it through. Do not watch this movie, even for a laugh. You want a good bad movie, watch 'Troll 2' or 'Truth or Dare' or a myriad of others. Leave this abomination to the obscurity it so richly deserves.",1272326400,3,1779,4.686900958466453
