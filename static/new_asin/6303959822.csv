7857263,2,6303959822,"I loved Peter Sellers in The Mouse That Roared, Being There, and the Pink Panther movies.  But in this he isn't even funny. Nothing happens in the first half hour, so I couldn't get into it, then it's just some adulterous affairs that are hard to follow.  I wouldn't mind the pointless aimlessness if it were funny, but it just has a few silly gags like the fox escaping the fox hunt in a passing car.",1367107200,,401,4.2631578947368425
7857264,5,6303959822,"Based quite loosely upon a play of the same name by Jean Anouilh, this film has been designed not merely as a showcase for the oversize comedic talent of Peter Sellers, but also, due to excessive producer interference, as a sex farce where character predominates over language, after the manner of a well-wrought and linear work of theatre. A droll script by Wolf Mankowitz transposes the action from post World War II France to early 20th century Sussex, arranging the characters in the story-propelled manner of the playwright, whose intensive exploration of the spirit becomes increasingly prominent as the work runs its course, greatly assisted by sensitive performances from Sellers, as the libidinous General Leo Fitzjohn, and by Margaret Leighton as Emily, his suffering wife. The plot spirals about the freshly retired General Fitzjohn and his longwhile Gallic inamorata, Ghislaine (Dany Robin) who have, as seen in a series of flashbacks, never been able to complete their love, but who are apparently finally going to be able to do so; that is, if a series of latter-day obstacles might be overcome. The picture is directed smoothly by John Guillermin, and there are excellent performances from Cyril Cusack as Dr. Grogan, the General's best friend, and John Fraser as a naive subaltern assigned to Fitzjohn, while a magnificent score is contributed by Richard Addinsell, one of his best for the screen, notable for its unreserved use of a minor key to accompany romantic and comic events. Unlike his Absurdist contemporaries, Anouilh never abandoned a sense of existential despair throughout his dramas, and this production succeeds in creating tension between Fitzjohn's sense of loss of place and his ability to forge forward after his natural urges, as evidenced by the delicious ending.",1109030400,3,1801,5.213793103448276
7857265,3,6303959822,"A decidedly minor and rather oddball addition to the Sellers filmography, dating from the pre-Pink Panther era when Sellers was still more of a comic actor rather than merely a clown. Even so, it was a strange vehicle for him. Originally a stage farce by Jean Anouilh, the script's style suffers from being re-located to England. Called ""The Amorous General"" on its American release, Sellers plays an old lecher in uniform with an eye for servant girls and a French would-be mistress who has been waiting eighteen years to consumate their affair. Except for a few bits of clumsy slapstick, Sellers gives a refreshingly restrained performance and is assisted by a solid and note-perfect supporting cast that includes Cyril Cusack as a wistful yet rascally doctor, Margaret Leighton as the general's shrewish wife, John Fraser as an uptight yet sexually curious young officer, and an amazingly young Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) as one of the general's precocious daughters. As the mistress, Dani Robin is certainly French and gorgeous, and also has a delightful comic touch. So it is a shame that these performances should be let down by such a shapeless script and uncertain direction.
Perhaps the film should have been made in black and white to allow the viewer to concentrate on the characters more without being distracted by pretty costumes and lush landscapes. Or maybe the film simply should have been made by the French. Peter Sellers was a considerable comic talent, especially in his earlier films, but he was no farceur. His hero, Alec Guinness, might have got away with playing this role. But Waltz of the Toreadors, in this form, remains the same disappointment it was nearly forty years ago.",1022630400,4,1707,5.014084507042254
7857266,5,6303959822,"In my humble opinion this is one of the best movies ever made.
Of course it is a funny movie - Peter Sellers is a genius, but this picture is art, and literature as well.  The story, the casting, all excellent.
Waltz of the Toreadors is a brilliant metaphor for this story - man without God, stuck in a dizzying dance of his own passions and fears.  Life can be wonderful, and yet troubling and depressing. This movie explores the great question - what is the meaning of life?  Is it ""the urge - because life without the urge is unthinkable.""  Can the soul be satisfied?  This is a serious movie, yet wholly entertaining and funny.  The theme is for adults, although the movie is clean with regard to language.
  I recommend this movie to you.",994982400,9,743,4.411764705882353
7857267,4,6303959822,"A very enjoyable film.  It's both a comedy and a drama.  Peter Sellers gives a wonderful performance which binds the film together.  It was  adapted from a play by Jean Anouilh (remember Becket?), and it's a very  enjoyable film.  But I have a single caveat - there are some early parts of  the film where you may be disappointed by the dramatic nature of the plot,  but if you just keep watching, you'll find a film that's both funny and  moving - and there aren't many of those!  I think the ending must be the  most touching of any of Sellers' films.",967852800,5,553,4.323529411764706
