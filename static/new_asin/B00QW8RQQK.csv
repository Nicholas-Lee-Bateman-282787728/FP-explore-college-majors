8693170,5,B00QW8RQQK,"This is an entirely engrossing and enjoyable exploration and shared experience of the relatively new and highly respected Orchestra Mozart which was the last of the ensembles closely identified with Claudio Abbado. It simply radiates joy in its many guises and makes this a very unique documentary which gives an invaluable insight to the working and social lives of these talented musicians.  (This review was written after considering the Blu-ray option and using the earlier UK release of the multi-region disc).

The orchestra was actually created by Carlo Badini as a special project within the Regia Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna and funded by the Savings bank Foundation of Bologna. Subsequently Abbado, a native of Bologna, agreed to become the artistic Director and to recruit its members. The first concert took place in November 2004 and this film was created during the 2012-2013 season in Bologna and during its tours during that time. Abbado later died in January 2014.

During the course of the film the viewer gets to experience the views and activities of a considerable number of the orchestral members whether they be young or more mature, section leaders or rank and file. Unfailingly the film shows a vibrant group that melds well to form its own society in which all value each other both as musicians, and perhaps even more importantly, as people and friends. The personnel of the orchestra crosses all social barriers of race, gender, creed, background and, regardless of that or perhaps because of that, bonds together in a most inspiring way.

Abbado has had a great impact upon this development as his own personal approach to making music has been one of a leader among equals where he saw his role as guide and encourager rather than as dictator. This has been his approach to music making throughout his career but the results of this unifying approach is particularly apparent here.

Within the parameters of creating a unified performance, the members of the orchestra are constantly encouraged to listen to each other, to respect each other and to support each other and within that concept feel free to be expressive. The result, as heard from many members, is that there is an over-riding excitement and corporate unity in terms of performance.

There are copious examples of ensemble and individual music making throughout the film which explores all aspects of life on the move. An extensive interview with Abbado in the form of a relaxed conversation is split up into short sections and inserted into the documentary which provides a continuity of connections with Abbado while avoiding any sense of dominance. This fits in well with Abbados stated views in terms of shared experiences and contributions to music making.

The technical aspects of the film are very good with sensitive camera work which responds well to all situations. The imaging is clear and the sound, presented in 5.1 and stereo, is excellent, particularly considering the varying circumstances in which it was recorded. There are subtitles provided in English, French, German, Italian and Korean.

The booklet is informative and interesting and reproduces much of the Abbado interview. This is a quality product technically. The bonus feature provides more comment from orchestral members all of which reinforces all the views mentioned above. The short running time of 60 minutes seems irrelevant on this occasion bearing in mind the high levels of satisfaction on offer.

In summary, this film simply radiates humanity and the joy of life well beyond the boundaries of pure music making. As such it is a film that should be widely appreciated regardless of viewers musical commitments.

This film simply radiates humanity and joy making this a film that should be widely appreciated regardless of musical commitment",1427587200,4,3830,5.13322632423756
8693171,4,B00QW8RQQK,"This blu-ray is about various members of the Mozart orchestra, including a violinist, a viola player, two double bass players, the kettle drummist, and a trumpeter. Of course, Claudio Abbado is interviewed. It's fascinating to see his collection of scores and to hear him answer a question concerning memorizing scores. The picture quality is superb! Colors pop and details are sharp. There are some nice panoramic shots of the various cities they travel to, underlining something you learn about this orchestra: it's VERY international. What's missing IS what SHOULDN'T be missing: a complete performance of something! Then the camera could linger awhile on the various musicians you've gotten to know and it would be nice. In fact, there IS no complete performance of ANYTHING whatsoever. Humm. Still, worth owning. (By the by, it's a region-free blu-ray, so no problem purchasing it.)",1424304000,4,887,5.297872340425532
