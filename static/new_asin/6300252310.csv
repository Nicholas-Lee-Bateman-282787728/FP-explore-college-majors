The special effects also looked [poor], if you look at some scenes, when a guy is near Gorgo. If you look close, when the debris and parts of the top of the London bridge falls on the military, the debris and parts from the  bridge are bluish, or aqua. Some scenes are like that.

282115,4,6300252310,"I remember this film showing on TV in NY, well, it seemed like every Saturday when I was  a kid.  It came with one of the funniest typical TV Guide blurbs I remember from those days, something like:  ""Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to bring that prehistoric monster back to London.  Now its mother is coming looking for it.""  And that was it.  And that IS it.  That's the plot.  Ambitious get-rich-quick guys find monster, bring it back to London over the objections of local boy who is wiser than all the adults in the picture, put it on display a la King Kong or Mighty Joe Young, and find something two or three times larger marching up the Thames Estuary soon after looking for its offspring.  Plenty of mayhem ensues, of course.  This is not quite up there with the classic Japanese monster films, but it will entertain you.  The extras on the DVD are good too.",1014595200,15,868,4.3625
282116,4,6300252310,"Gorgo was one of those heavily hyped horror movies from my childhood. Produced by the same man who produced the classic ""Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" this one is a classic in its own right. Here the creature is seen in a sympathetic light, not as just a menace. There is a reason for the rampage through London. It seems our heros have stolen it's offspring and wisked it away to the circus. Well, mom was furious, and London paid the price. The acting is decent, the effects are good for its time. Fans of old fashioned panic in the streets horror will like this one.",1004400000,,566,4.4

282118,4,6300252310,"One of his favorites, but it gets four stars because it isn't one of mine.  This is the film noir of the 50's golden age tide.  No one in this film, except Gorgo, is very likable.  Everyone is after a buck and doesn't seem to be too concerned who gets in their way while getting it.  I guess what Benjamin likes is that the Mommy/Daddy monster comes and saves Gorgo and I have to say that does alot to redeem the film.  This is one I rather he didn't want to watch so often.",980899200,,474,4.0
282119,4,6300252310,"Another of those ""monster on the loose"" movies that were popular back in the '50s and '60s.  Two sea salvage guys discover a prehistoric  creature, presumably resurrected by unusual volcanic activity, off the  Irish coast.  In typical Grade B movie fashion, they view the creature as a  moneymaking opportunity, regardless of other considerations.  After the  beast is captured, and delivered to a London circus, it is dubbed  ""Gorgo"" based on the Gorgon of Greek Mythology.  While the  creature languishes in captivity, British paleontologists discover the  65-foot tall animal is actually an ""infant.""  They presume an  infant implies a ""parent.""  Things really go ""crash, bang,  boom!"" when Gorgo's angry parent, three times the infant's size, comes  calling on London town.
The color photography enhances the excitement as  the gigantic creature demolishes familiar London landmarks.  Although  cliches dominate much of the script, the twist of making the captured  creature only an infant sets up an exciting climax.  The special effects  lean more to the ""actor in a rubber monster suit"" variety than  the excellent stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen or Willis O'Brien.  Some  of the stock footage shows American Navy planes taking off from an aircraft  carrier, but the planes and their markings turn British while in the air.  Upon landing, the planes revert back to American Navy aircraft.  The joys  of editing, and the delights of unintended humor.  Viewing this film is not  an intellectual experience, obviously.  The movie, however, is explosive  Grade B fun for kids of all ages.  Knock yourself out.  ;-)",966384000,16,1621,5.2727272727272725

But you can't really blame them; after all, Gorgo is such an adorable  little tyke.  Unfortunately, mommy is not in a very forgiving mood.  This  is one time the Irish Government was very happy to let London win.  You  know the song; ""London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling.  . .""

282121,5,6300252310,"As with many movies of this era, the unleashing of the atom has dire consequences for mankind. Once again, the atom has brought forth a giant reptile. What distinguishes this movie is that the thirty-foot tall reptile  is actually an infant.  Imagine how angry the child's two-hundred foot tall  mother gets when her baby is captured by money-seeking adventurers. Imagine  how much angrier she will get when baby becomes the main attraction at  London's Piccadilly Circus. In a manner that would make Godzilla even  greener with envy, mother Gorgo takes out her displeasure first on the  British Navy, and then on London itself.  A reporter covers the carnage in  the same tones the world heard when London survived the WW2 blitz, and this  lends an eerie air of realism to the movie. It may be hard to imagine a  heartwarming atomic dinosaur monster movie, but this one will leave you  feeling very pleased that the monster wins.  I still cheer every time I see  mother Gorgo, tanks and planes blasting away at her, slam London's Big Ben  tower to the ground!",943488000,9,1060,4.779005524861878

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: After many years as one of cinema's foremost art directors and production designers, including several collaborations with Jean Renoir, Eugne Louri got his first opportunity to direct a feature film with the dinosaur-on-the-loose classic 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' [1953], which a Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen collaboration. The film was a huge hit-except with Eugne Lourie's young daughter, who cried because the monster died at the end. As he dried the girl's tears, an idea formed in the director's mind for a monster film in which the creature would be permitted to live happily ever after. Several years and one dinosaur film later 'The Giant Behemoth' [1959], Eugne Lourie's idea reached the screen as 'GORGO' [1961], an extremely satisfying monster spectacular that has remained a fan favourite for more than 40 years. VCI Entertainment, which released the film a few years ago on an inferior DVD, has now been reissued with a new transfer on this awesome Blu-ray disc.

Ever since 'King Kong,' audiences have responded favourably to outlandish fantasies about giant monsters. This curious subgenre came into its own in the early 1950s, with again 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms,' which updated the theme with the dubious notion of a prehistoric monster revived by atomic radiation. The director of this clever Warner Bros. hit film was a former designer of famous French films, Eugne Louri. Design skills perfected on masterpieces like the film 'Children of Paradise' found curious expression making an epic story on a very low budget.

The cost of spectacular special effects and scenes of urban panic discouraged films of this kind in the United States. The subgenre was effectively adopted by Japanese producers just a year later, with the big-budgeted, influential Godzilla. Ironically, the only real competition for Toho's 'Titan of Terror' were subsequent films from director Eugne Louri. 'The Giant Behemoth' ['Behemoth, Sea Monster'] [1958] began as an amorphous blob monster, but its cautious producers instead asked the director for another aquatic dinosaur. Eugne Louri rewrote his 'The Beast' for an English locale, giving his new monster the ability to project intense waves of radiation. King Kong's Willis O'Brien produced the special effects. A couple of years later the prolific King Brothers, former makers of westerns and films noir, moved to England with the idea of producing a Godzilla-style monster epic on a truly lavish scale. Frank King and Maurice King had made a bundle by importing Toho's Rodan, a thriller about a supersonic flying reptile. They hired Eugne Louri, who found himself making essentially the same film for the third time. 'GORGO' was filmed for Technicolor release by Freddie A. Young, the cinematographer of 'Lawrence of Arabia.' An enormous miniature set of London's River Thames filled an entire soundstage, and film units were dispatched to Ireland for key sequences. Given a symphonic music score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, 'GORGO' received a wide release with saturation advertising that promised it to be, ""Like Nothing You've Ever Seen Before."" Its wondrous sense of spectacle and its original theme won over audiences and critics alike.

Not many monster films have as original or inventive a storyline as 'GORGO.' Under Eugne Louri 's direction, the film's credited writers John Loring and Daniel Hyatt, who were actually the blacklisted Robert L. Richards and Daniel James, concocted a tale in which a defiant Mother Nature triumphs over human greed and folly. Eugne Louri had noted that his young daughter loved the original Beast, and was unhappy to see it meet the traditional fate indicated for classic film monsters. Eugne Louri decided that his new monster would not only live, but also prevail. This idea reportedly met with the King Brothers enthusiastic approval. When trying to get the British Censor to allow children to see the film, they claimed it to be a testimony to Mother Love. As finished, the show definitely communicates an emotional proto-ecological message.

The film's monster GORGO is a thirty-foot aquatic creature with enormous claws, glowing red eyes and oversized dragon-like ears. Shady salvage experts Bill Travers and William Sylvester capture the monster and rush it to London for exhibition in a circus in Battersea Park. Opposing the partners are some Irish scientists that object to the commercial exploitation of ""the find of the century"". Little Irish stowaway Sean [Vincent Winter] cares nothing about science or money. He believes GORGO to be the Irish Sea fairy OGRA, and wants him to be set free. But then the scientists determine that the monster is not ""an adult specimen"", but a relative new-born. While the arguments continue, a colossal Mother GORGO rises from the sea to free its offspring. When attempts to halt it fail, the monster wades up the River Thames, destroying half of London en route.

Advocates of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen style stop-motion animation are the only detractors of 'GORGO,' which uses large miniature settings and stuntmen in complex rubber costumes to play the film's monsters. Clever design and a good mime performance mostly overcome the limitations of the technique, which allows for a greater variety of camera angles and more creative lighting than most stop-motion pictures can afford. With director Eugne Louri's design sense and Freddie A. Young's spectacular lighting schemes, 'GORGO' looks appropriately huge as it rips down bridges and towers. A broad swath of central London is demolished, as impressive scenes of panicked crowds sell the idea of civilisation thrown into utter chaos. Naturally, all the ships, guns and jets thrown against the maternal colossus have no effect. Not even the original Godzilla generates as much excitement.

The film is unusually brief at 77 minutes for an epic, and it bears traces of a troubled production ""saved"" in the editing room. Unusually fast-paced editing rushes through the bare minimum of dialogue scenes to get to the action highlights, suggesting that some dramatic material was discarded, or never shot due to budget restraints. The twenty-minute London attack sequence is packed with impressive action and the monster destroys the Tower Bridge, Big Ben and invades Piccadilly Circus. But too much indifferent stock footage is used to depict the military retaliation, and the editor is so desperate for shots that he repeats some scenes by flopping them left to right. That said, the height of the human stampede before he onrushing Mother GORGO communicates a feeling of pure panic.

What really distinguishes this monster romp is its unexpected, nearly subversive theme which sides with the monsters against the decadent civilisation that fails to respect God's natural creatures. GORGO's rampage is documented by a roving reporter character, which was possibly added in post-production, that finishes the film by delivering a stirring defence for the victorious monsters, in saying, ""And yet, as though disdaining the pygmies under her feet, she turns back, turns with her young, leaving the prostrate city, leaving the haunts of man. Leaving man himself to ponder the proud boast that he alone is Lord of all creation.""

The film's sentimental touches won over audiences, big time. Surprised reviewers were moved as well and wrote enthusiastic notices, a rare occurrence indeed for a lowly monster film. Mother GORGO's enormous foot smashes through the exhibition pen at the circus, allowing her baby to follow her back to the river. Sean watches, wide-eyed and happy as the baby answers its mother's call with another elephant-like roar. 'GORGO' thus became a big favourite for a generation of young matinee-goers. So put the Blu-ray disc in, get the popcorn in, relax and enjoy a marvellous rollercoaster tour-de-force monster film.

In spite of some of its flaws, the Blu-ray disc is recommended because the film is that good, and it is unlikely that a better DVD edition of 'GORGO' will ever appear anytime soon, thank goodness. Since it was distributed theatrically in the USA by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the original film elements are probably with Warner Bros., who are the owners of the pre-1986 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library, but the original distribution agreement may have expired, or may not have covered home video. Even if they have the rights to the film's apparent public domain status, may discourage the studio from giving it a proper release. An unfortunate fate for one of the best giant monster films ever made.

Blu-ray Image Quality  VCI Entertainment's Blu-ray disc of 'GORGO' has been re-mastered from original elements stored in a Kansas salt mine storage facility used by Turner Entertainment and subsequently Warner Bros., for many of their holdings from the pre-1986 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film library. The 1080p HD transfer is somewhat uneven but approximates the look of original Technicolor prints, especially in the spectacular night-time attack sequences. The IB Tech printing process had a way of smoothing out grainy footage, and viewers may be surprised when some scenes look better than others. But the awesome sight of GORGO's green head and glowing crimson eyes rising from the ocean is undiminished. VCI Entertainment has spent a year collecting extras for their special edition. A documentary called 'Ninth Wonder of the World' makes do with the few behind-the-scenes materials that exist for 'GORGO,' and uses a scattershot editing style to tell the story of dinosaur films in general.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The main audio option on this Blu-ray disc is the film's original English language track, presented here in 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio with optional subtitles provided in English only. An optional French language track is also included in 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio. Dialogue is audible enough and easy to follow and the monster noises sound a bit more powerful and strong here than they did on the inferior DVD. The score also sounds a little richer and more robust than it has in the past. There is still flatness to much of the audio that probably won't ever be eliminated but if this isn't an amazing track by any stretch it certainly gets the job done without any serious issues.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Optional Music and Effects Track

THEATRICAL TRAILER [1961] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:29] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for 'GORGO.' This is a really dramatic and exciting trailer that really gives you a flavour of what to expect when you actually view the brilliant monster film.

Special Feature: GORGO: THE MONSTER FROM THE SEA! Comic Book and Comic Book Gallery [2013] [1080p] [1.37:1] [34:02] This is very unusual slide show presentation, in that we get move through the comic book page images, where they scroll across the screen horizontally and with occasional close-ups of various pages, so have your pause button handy on your remote control if you actually want to read what is being viewed. At the start of this viewing experience, you get to hear the dramatic composed film music of the film GORGO in the background, but after a while it all goes silent and with each page you view, which they do give you time to read the wording above the artists comic book drawings, which some are in black-and-white and colour. The publications we get to view are GORGO: GORGO: THE MONSTER FROM THE SEA! [First Edition]; WONDERS OF THE DEEP; CAPTAINS COREYS CURIOSITY CORNER; FEAR!

The first items we get to view are the GORGO resin models that were sculpted by Joseph Laudati in the USA in 1993 and they look totally spectacular. Other resin models of GORGO we get to view, were made by the M1/Club Daikaiju Toy company that were manufactured in Japan/USA in 2002 and the Palmer Plastic Toys made in the USA in 1994. Once again as the items are shown, we again hear the distinct composed film music for the film GORGO played in the background and again I found it a really nice presentation.

Special Feature: THE 9TH WONDER OF THE WORLD: The Making of 'GORGO' [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [31:08] Here we get to view a brand new documentary by Daniel Griffith, that has been produced by the Ballyhoo Motion Pictures, who always do a really excellent and professional special documentaries, and to me personally I feel this is probably one of the best ever special feature supplement in this package, and is a very nice well thought out and fascinating documentary detailing the background to the film GORGO and is filled with probably unintentionally humorous comments by a plethora of 'GORGO' experts. On top of all that, we get a great deal of plethora of film clips from GORGO. Narrated by Randall Turnbull. Contributors include: C. Courtney Joyner [Screenwriter/Film Historian], Ted Newsom [Film Historian], Eugne Louri [French film director] [Audio only], Bob Burns [Special Effects Historian], Douglas Adams [Second Unit Camera Operator] [Audio only], Daniel Griffith [Screenplay/Producer/Director], Randall Turnbull [Screenplay], Tom Weaver [Story/Screenplay], Paul Mandell [Additional Material] and Angelo Francesco Lavagnino [GORGO Musical Score].

Once again as the items are being shown, we again hear the dramatic composed film music for the film GORGO played in the background and again I found it a really nice presentation.

Special Feature: ORIGINAL PRODUCTION NOTES [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:05] With this very unusual slide show presentation, in that we get to move through the images of the rare original King Bros. Production Limited of the Proposed Unit For Ireland Locational schedule sheets for shooting the scenes for the film GORGO, which also informs us of the actual days shooting schedule, and with this very unusual slide show presentation, in that we get to move through the images of the rare original production notes and so have your pause button handy on your remote control if you actually want to read what is being viewed, but unfortunately you get the peculiar situation, in that the overlapping way the pages are presented hides some of the reading content. Once again as the items are being shown, we again hear the dramatic composed film music for the film GORGO played in the background and again I found it a really nice presentation.

Special Feature: STAR Cin COSMOS: French-language ""Fumetto"" Comic Book [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [40:41] This is a French comic book publication, which is presented in much the same way as the previous American comic book publication images, and of course all the wording is all in French, and if you cannot read French, you have a plethora of images from the film GORGO to fathom out what the wording says. Once again we get to view these items via the very unusual slide show presentation, in that we get to move through the images of the rare STAR Cin COSMOS ""Fumetto"" Comic Book pages. Once again as the items are being shown, we again hear the dramatic composed film music for the film GORGO played in the background, as well right at the end of the viewing experience and again I found it a really nice presentation.

Once again as the items are being shown, we again hear the dramatic composed film music for the film GORGO played in the background, as well right at the end of the viewing experience and again I found it a really nice presentation.

Special Feature: BEFORE & AFTER RESTORATON [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:52] This shows us a split screen offering before and after versions of several scenes. There was substantial colour correction and contrast improvement done as well as some fairly vigorous clean-up of the images. Once again as we view the before and after versions of several scenes shown, we again hear the dramatic composed film music for the film GORGO played in the background, as well right at the end of the viewing experience and again I found it a really nice presentation.

Finally, 'GORGO' absolutely gets a decent upgrade on this Blu-ray from VCI Entertainment with this release. Is this a Blu-ray disc that's going to appeal to the hard-core high definition fans out there? No, it's not, but it is definitely a lot better than previous inferior DVD offerings in terms of audio and video and it also includes some excellent extras as well. So if you are a fan of the film GORGO like me and you are familiar with the scenario story line, warts and all, then this is an upgrade worthwhile ordering the Blu-ray disc and you will not be disappointed. Those unfamiliar with GORGO's charms may want to rent it first, but the film remains a great deal of good, uncontrollable rampant fun. When I first viewed this film in the cinema, I loved it and felt it was far superior to the Japanese 'Godzilla' films and when it was announced this was to be released, I could not hold back and had to have it added to my VCI Entertainment Blu-ray Collection and now I can have endless hours of enjoyment watching this brilliant Classic British Horror Film whenever the mood takes me. Highly Recommended!

282252,3,6300252310,"If you are a fan of the Japanese monster movies like me you may enjoy this, but it struck me as a wannabe Godzilla film. It was like the rest of the world saw how popular Godzilla was and decided to try and rip it off. They made the monster bigger, they attacked with planes and tanks, and even used electrified fences with more power to try to stop the monster, but this time they did away with the pesky ""nuclear responsibility"" plot-line.

If you take away the ""let's make our own Godzilla and let's make him better than the Japanese"" mentality that his movie seems pretty obviously trying to pull off, it was a good film with a solid moral to the plot. Opportunists tried to make a quick buck off of something new and amazing without considering the consequences, and it ended up costing them (and everyone around them) dearly. In the end, mankind learns a valuable lesson and mamma gets her baby back. The special effects are on par with 1961 films and it's all in English; so, no subtitles necessary.",1488240000,,1006,4.467391304347826

This winner, that boasts some impressive spfx moments and a terrific monster costume, adds to the beastie runs amok trope by having a mama Gorgo fetching her stolen baby. This mixes in shades of King Kong because the baby was stolen by some Brits who end up selling it to a circus act; with baby Gorgo crying for mama while hes cooped up in a park, film fans will recall that Kong himself was placed on display and while it ended poorly for that great big ape it happily doesnt end so bad for baby Gorgo.

It was not a big-budget movie and that shows on the film quality, despite being restored and put into blu-ray. In several scenes, the actors were poorly superimposed into pre-filmed scenes (on boats, on the streets, and others). There are several errors and goofs, also. But if you can ignore the goofs, fake fog, jets flying in a bright blue sky at night, and bright red eyes of the creatures, it can be an entertaining blast from the past.

282274,3,6300252310,"Great old monster movie.  These Brits knew how to party:  treasure dives off the coast of Ireland;  kidnapping a baby monster;  throwing a welcome party all over London when Momma Monster arrives.  What could be better?  It reminds me of that Roger Miller song:  England burns like a Tokyo do, little tanks stepped on two by two.  Westminster Abbey, the Tower, all gone.  The rosy red cheeks of the monster children.  (Poetic license, the monster child does not have rosy cheeks.)

Enjoyable classic, not on a par with some of the great American and Japanese monster classics of that period.  Certainly not in the same league as the British Quatermass movies.  But watchable, well made, well acted and decent special effects.  Notable was the lack of talk about radiation.  Evidently atomics were not at the heart of British nightmares the way they were in America and Japan.  They seem to mainly be afraid of the Irish, with cause I suppose.

I suspect the underlying point here was to reassure the English citizenry that they would rise to meet the challenge of the Cold War, just like in WWII.  Or, maybe this is about their fear of immigrants from their waning Empire?  Who knows, these are deep waters full of monsters.

All kidding aside, the Amazon print, for which I cheerfully paid $3.99 to watch, was a nice, crisp version.  All cleaned up for company.  I highly recommend it.  Why only three stars?  Four for Godzilla.  Five for Quatermass at the Pit.",1473206400,2,1462,4.729083665338646

50 years passed and I finally got to see it in a pretty poor condition version on Youtube. I wish I hadn't viewed it there as the Blue Ray soon came out after!!

Be that as it may, after all this time, I went, ""It's a guy in a rubber suit????"" I was use to Ray Harryhausens' dinosaurs....!!

Yet, when I viewed it on the Blue Ray with it's short running time (73mins!!... well, there was no love/female interest to spin it out 30 mins more!!), I had to admit I was starting to really enjoy it. Despite Gorgo stomping around in his rubber skin, it was very effective with what it destroyed in the way of special effects. Lots of running around and panic were the order of the day as the mother went after the child.

So when I saw it on Amazon I had to rent it.  It has stood up well over time.  William Travers stars and he was a fine actor.  Special effects are not up to today's standards but London is suitably squashed by a mommy monster looking for her baby monster.  There is very satisfying ending.,1408233600,,460,4.044444444444444

Take note as Gorgo reaches London - it has only one mindset / focus...get out of her way,,,if you do,.she could care less about you.

282587,4,6300252310,"BOTTOM LINE: A treat for fans of giant creatures on the rampage, GORGO has never looked better than here on this nicely-done restoration Blu-ray. Worth buying, and definitely worth a double-dip if you own it on DVD or VHS tape. This Blu-ray belongs in your collection if you're a fan of this kind of stuff. 4 STARS.

THE STORY: Volcanic eruptions of the coast of Ireland releases a prehistoric beastie from its watery tomb. Enterprising Yanks capture the thing and haul it back to merry old England, intending to exhibit and make a ton of money. Unfortunately for them, it turns out the monster they've caught is just an infant... and Mama Gorgo is hot on Junior's trail. Nothing, not missiles, rockets, fire, bombs nor anything else the British army can throw at this big cranky mother will stop her until she's rescued her baby. Can you say ""London Bridge is falling down?""

THOUGHTS: If you enjoy giant monster movies then GORGO is nothing you haven't seen before, but it's done quite well and the change of scenery and a cast of non-Japanese actors make for an interesting diversion. The effects are on par with any Golden Age Godzilla flick. Acting is straightforward, serious and well done, for the most part. Surprising that this flick didn't spawn a sequel or two, especially considering the popularity of the prolific Godzilla and Gamera movies at the box office at the time this was released.

THE BLU-RAY: I've owned this film in several versions over the years: taped off a late night TV broadcast, a factory VHS, DVD, a slightly better Special Edition DVD... and now on Blu-ray. Well I can tell you that someone has finally done this fun old film justice! I was never really a big fan of this film and often couldn't get through it in a single sitting. Pretty sad since it only runs 78 minutes. I kept upgrading, hoping to get something that wouldn't end up looking like a 27th generation dupe, but to no avail. :-(

Now comes this new-to-Blu edition. The folks at VCI have really done a nice job of restoring GORGO. In the special features section there's a side-by-side comparison of the restoration work done for this edition, seen in split screen next to what we've all suffered through up until now. The difference is literally night & day. Underwater scenes and daytime outdoor shots really highlight the dramatic improvement that this upgrade offers. Sadly, the focus isn't as sharp as I'd prefer, but I gotta say that this new GORGO Blu-ray is worlds above everything that's come before it. I can finally watch this from beginning to end now without losing interest. Maybe all this time is was just because the film elements looked so scratchy, washed out and faded?? The picture is beautifully restored (no more film scratches or faded, murky footage); the mono sound thunders nicely, (especially the rousing musical score) and there are no annoying pops or crackles anymore.

I mentioned the extras earlier... Well my friends, if you love extra bonus goodies then you are in luck here! This new GORGO Blu-ray has several of them and they're all pretty sweet! There are nicely arranged picture galleries of production stills, lobby cards, pressbooks, other promo materials, and more. Two classic old GORGO comics are thoughtfully reproduced from cover-to-cover: issue #1 of the full-color hand drawn comic, (featuring artwork by Steve Ditko!), and a fumetti comic (word balloons over B&W photographs from the film), which is in Italian. And last, but certainly not least, is an all-new ""making of"" documentary that gives a very nice overview of the genesis, production and history of everything GORGO. Well done guys! THIS is how a classic monster movie home release should be done.",1394236800,3,3704,4.863708399366086

First the concept of a monster being captured and taken to London to exhibit is almost standard fare, but what makes Gorgo the classic it is, is that the first monster is the Baby! Now Mama is destroying everything in her path to come and get her baby. This unique plot twist is what sets it ahead of all the others but Kong.

The previous Destruction Edition DVD helped clean up some foggy film sequences, mostly the underwater ones. They're really crisp now in Blu-ray. I know a lot of fans like me wish there were a ton of behind the scenes photos especially showing how the Gorgo (Mom and baby) scenes were shot but so far, very few have shown up.

One thing I hope someone out there can help me in verifying a particular actor in a supporting role. It certainly looks like the Prophet of Doom when Mama arrives is the actor John Wood. So far, I can't find any proof of this. Can someone else help?",1392163200,2,1042,4.338461538461538

The villagers try harpooning the beast, which only makes it angry. A deal is struck w/ some sailors to capture and dispose of the behemoth, leading to its transport to London. The men decide to cash in on the monster by putting it on display in a circus. Shockingly, this turns out to be a not-so brilliant idea, as GORGO is actually a baby, and mum has tracked her offspring down! Her arrival in London is classic stuff indeed! She's huge, enraged, and quickly sets out on a rampage of vengeful destruction! GORGO is an excellent giant monster movie w/ a cool critter and decent special FX. The story is sort of a hybrid of the reptilian brutality of GODZILLA and the more sympathetic, ""greedy human"" elements of KING KONG. A must for all monster maniacs!... P.S.- GORGO is one of a very few movies that I've ever seen w/ no females in either lead or supporting roles! Well, at least no HUMAN females...",1387843200,4,1082,4.640625

Obviously the film has been remastered and the color restored. This film was made when creatures and effects had to be created for real and not on a computer and though today they may seem cheesy, for a 6 year old in the early 60's it was magic.

All the elements are there: The small time businessman who thinks he'll make a fortune, the concerned scientist, the little kid who understands the monster better than anyone.

With this release, as far as I am concerned, VCI has graduated to the same class as Kino and Criterion! Who would have thought that the big Red-eyed mom and kid would look this good?
Actually this possibly trumps those companies, as it is a lot more fun with all these extras. Those highbrow and serious-minded deluxe entities, as much as I do love them, would have probably given this a completely different approach and missed the infectious excitement of GORGO.
When I was a young lad, I saw this when it first opened.  The way it looked then was stamped on my mind.  Those striking red eyes!!
This edition on BD is EXACTLY they way I remember it.  The grain and grit were on the print even back then.  For me it's Kudos to VCI for keeping GORGO as close to that first theatrical experience as possible.
I should also mention that the extras are way above and beyond what anyone would have asked for.  I, for one, really do appreciate the effort that went into this release.  I recall that over a year ago a VCI representative was asking around the Classic Horror Film Board for info on what the fans would like to see in this release.  I can't think of another DVD company that would care that much about a film's fan base.
The documentary on the disc is worth the price alone.  It left me wanting more even though it contained just about everything there was to comment on the film.  It was so good, in fact, I ended up watching it twice.
The only thing missing here is the Gorgo Pez dispenser.  And that's not here because there never was one!!  Bravo VCI and welcome to the top of the heap.",1367366400,2,1611,4.336666666666667

282819,5,6300252310,"Director Eugene Lourie's third giant monster movie and the first in color 'GORGO'-1960 gets the definitive transfer in this gorgeous Blu-Ray release by VCI entertainment.  Released theatrically by MGM, it seems it is now in the public domain and was released in two previous incarnations by VCI on DVD but they are quickly left under Mama Gorgo's big feet with this stunning 1.78 transfer from the best negative ever.  Although the blue screen effects and stock footage may be a tinch grainy in some spots (it was much worse on the big screen) the clean up and negative restoration goes a long way. Wait till you see the monsters climactic rampage through London taking place at night and you'll see what I mean. The cinematography by Freddie Young finally gets the treatment that it deserves.  You will also appreciate the beautiful score from Italian composer Angelo Francisco Lavagnino which fluctuates from bombastic to celtic beauty. He touched many genres from Spaghetti Westerns to Sci-Fi space operas but this remains one of his best. VCI gives you the option of isolating the score and its sound effects on their own.  The Blu-ray also enhances the Special Effects by Tom Howard and, Yes, it is a man in a suit movie rather than stop motion but if Director Inoshiro Honda could do it with his 'GODZILLA' aka 'GOJIRA'- 1955, Lourie actually may have improved on it. At a tight 77 minutes, we can forgive the over the top performances by Bill Travers and William Sylvestor by being caught up in the film's breathless pace. The special features in this package really are a 'GORGO' fans dream:  a 30 minute documentary 'THE 9TH WONDER OF THE WORLD: THE MAKING OF GORGO' written by Daniel Griffith, Film Historian Tom Weaver, Paul Mandell and Randall Turnbull who also narrates; motion animated galleries including Posters, Lobby cards. pressbook galleries, the covers of the 'GORGO' comic books, Toys. a behind the scenes photo gallery; Production notes from 1959 and ,of course, an original trailer.  Not my favorite in Director Eugene Lourie's monster trilogy, it does, however, ring a nostalgic bell for having viewed this in a movie theatre at the ripe old age of 7 years old and viewing it countless times back in the sixties on New York's old WOR TV 'MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE' which showed it about 6 times a day, its wonderful to see it in this dazzling Blu-Ray release light years ahead of the 35mm print shown in the theatres at that time.

282821,3,6300252310,"Just to clear the air...The New York Times comment at the top of front cover: ""The best outright monster shocker since King Kong"" is horribly incorrect. I guess they never heard of Toho's film ""Gojira"" from 1954 that took monster horror to a new level. But anyway, on to VCI's blu-ray for ""Gorgo"". This release is a mixed bag but it does excel in many areas; especially the important areas which are the monster mayhem scenes. The 1080p transfer looks very good at times when the Gorgo monsters are rampaging and causing chaos. Daylight scenes look very good too. But night scenes don't fair so well and neither does the plethora of stock footage. Don't go in expecting a transfer like the one for the blu-ray for ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" (1957) or even Criterion's amazing ""Gojira""/""Godzilla"" (1954, 1956) restoration. VCI gets kudos just for releasing ""Gorgo"" on the blu-ray format as did Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock did for releasing ""Destroy All Monsters"" on blu-ray. Mill Creek is also doing some fantastic blu-ray monster/kaiju releases with their stunning ""Daimajin Triple Feature"" and ""Gamera Triple Feature"" sets as well. For ""Gorgo"" don't expect a mind-blowing frame-by-frame restoration and don't expect thunderous DTS-HD master audio quality sound either. But know this, this is the best that ""Gorgo"" has ever looked on home video and it is very enjoyable to watch in 1080p HD. ""Gorgo"" is a mammoth monster film just like ""King Kong"" and ""Gojira"" before it. These were times well before CGI monster films like ""Cloverfield"", ""The Host"", ""Super 8"", ""Sector 7"", ""The Mist"" and ""Troll Hunter""; which are very fun films. But never count out the old monster films of the 30's, 50's, 60's and even the 70's. These are classic, entertaining films from the Golden Age of monster filmmaking. Toho's ""Rodan"", ""Ghidorah The Three-Headed Monster"" and ""Frankenstein vs. Baragon"" are other great examples but no current domestic blu-rays for these films are available. ""Gorgo"" is a must-buy on blu-ray. It is one of those releases that you purchase on day one. RECOMMENDED!!!",1363996800,4,2075,5.052478134110787
282822,5,6300252310,"England's answer to KING KONG (RKO,1933) and GODZILLA (Toho,1954) was the independently produced GORGO, which was released by MGM in 1961. Although lacking the iconic stature of its two cinematic precursors, GORGO is nonetheless a thoughtful, well mounted monster on the loose tale that's still largely underrated.

The story concerns the discovery and capture of a prehistoric creature off the coast of Ireland, which is then transported to London where it becomes the star attraction in a circus. The exhibition comes to an abrupt end when the creature's gargantuan mother arrives to claim her offspring and levels London in the process.

Directed by dino-film veteran Eugene Lourie, GORGO features good performances from its two leads, Bill Travers and William Sylvester, as the sea divers who capture Gorgo and then begin to differ over the morality of the venture. The heart of the film resides in young Vincent Winter's sensitive, intelligent portrayal of the orphaned boy who empathizes with the baby behemoth and its mother. John Loring and Maurice King's screenplay is made interesting by its setting, and cinematographer F. A. Young was able to get some excellent footage along Ireland's fishing coastal region. GORGO's special effects were provided by Tom Howard, and the climactic destruction of London is an impressively staged/executed sequence combining an actor in a monster suit, miniatures, full scale sets, travelling mattes and a large number of fleeing extras. There's an organic, solid quality to these kinds of effects that's infinitely more satisfying to me  than the most sophisticated CGI. When those buildings are smashed to smithereens they collapse spontaneously, not in some digitally controlled manner. GORGO's depiction of chaos and devastation is still convincing even after 50 years. What also serves the film well is Angelo Lavagnino's atmospheric music score, which gives it a delicate tone that conveys the parent/child relationship theme while contrasting with the powerful crescendos  heard during the rampage scenes.

VCI Entertainment has upgraded their previous DVD of GORGO with a spectacular looking Blu-ray edition that helps us appreciate even more what a well made film this is. Prints of GORGO have always been problematic, with either  brownish or washed out color. While the Blu-ray finally corrects this issue, the original process photography and composite optical printing techniques compromised the final result in many scenes, and this needs to be appreciated when watching the film in HD. In the final analysis, GORGO now looks the best it's likely to look, and fans are encouraged to pick up this eye-filling release.

Besides offering a great looking transfer of the movie, VCI has packed in a plethora of extras to sink your teeth into including a making of documentary, two full length comic book adaptations, a lobby card and poster gallery, photo gallery, a toys and collectibles gallery, production notes, original trailer, pressbook gallery, optional music and effects track, and a before/after restoration video. It all adds up to a long awaited, well deserved presentation of one of the best giant monster movies of all time.

Highly recommended.",1363737600,16,3212,5.3717693836978135
282823,4,6300252310,"The video is clean, other than the normal film grain which is supposed to be there. There are not a lot of scratches or anything like that. The colors are vivid, but there's not a great deal of detail, maybe a bit better than a good DVD.

The audio was advertised in the description as being LPCM 5.1, but much to my dismay, there is only an LPCM STEREO track. Too bad VCI couldn't deliver what they have been advertising for months, as a surround mix for this movie would be cool. I guess that's when Dolby Pro Logic II can come in handy. The good news is that the stereo sound is quite clear.

Overall, this is worth buying if you enjoy giant monster movies. The quality is good, and it has some entertaining special features.",1363737600,,728,4.306569343065694
282824,3,6300252310,"Gorgo arrives on Blu-ray via VCI Entertainment who previously released this movie on dvd in a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer about a decade ago.  This movie has been released multiple times on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD, all unfortunately featuring poor to barely decent transfers due to mostly the lack of any decent reference 35mm film print ever being available.

The plot in a nutshell concerns a giant dinosaur-like monster who is found and captured off the coast of a small island near Ireland and transported to London to be exhibited in a circus.  Real trouble erupts when a far bigger ""mother"" Gorgo razes the island and London itself looking for ""her"" baby.  This is a widescreen color film.

A VERY mixed bag on this release as expected.

First and foremost - the transfer....  There's never been a really good print of this movie presented on home video and that still holds true with this Blu-ray release.  It appears multiple sources may have been used or just 3/4ths of the reels are in lousy shape.  It doesn't help that this movie features some really terrible optical blue screen work.  Much of the opening scenes have an optical ""fog"" effect layered over the effects work to hide how cheesy they (were) which can make whole scenes incredibly murky and grainy.

Add to that there's a lot of public domain or ""library"" footage mostly of army and navy action that's been seen in dozens of other movies that looks pretty rough and inconsistant.  Add to that the source(s) used for this transfer looks very rough and VCI appears to have really run the gamma, color saturation and EE filters on full-tilt boogie to make what they had to work with presentable (although the ""Restoration"" split screen comparison looks suspect at best - I mean some ""original"" clips even in the same scene look like they have a green filter over the original image!).  I have no clue if this is the same source VCI used for their previous dvd release as it's so worked over digitally for the Blu-ray release.  So there's a lot of blown out, over saturated color which actually magnifies the poor blue screen work in some scenes.

But... late in the movie around the time when Mama Gorgo makes landfall in London, the picture quality improves dramatically, mostly to do with the man-in-suit footage that does surpass any previous home video release.  I mean, it's no ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" restoration but the last 15 minutes look downright decent compared to the rest of this presentation. So yes, it is a step up form any previous home video release.

What makes this possibly worth a buy is actually the extras for diehard fans of this movie.  Those in charge of putting the bonus material together came up with a lot of nice stuff lovingly assembled.  There's scans of the first Gorgo comic featuring art by the instantly recognizable Steve Ditko who's work here surpassed much of what he later did for Marvel Comics on titles like Spiderman and Dr Strange.  Images of toys and rare garage model kits, some interesting production notes and a short feature on the movie as well as a soundtrack option with no dialog (I hate to call it a music only track) round out the bonus material.

To sum up, the movie itself is good old fashioned early 60's giant monster innocent fun.  Just be prepared that the film is going to look pretty rough by today's HiDef standards.  If it wasn't for the extras, I would have a hard time giving this release even 2 stars.",1363651200,7,3447,4.6988352745424296
282875,5,6300252310,I was browsing Amazon one day and stumbled onto this movie and was very excited because this monster flic was one of my all time favorites when I was a kid and I purchased immediately and was delivered very fast.

282876,4,6300252310,"As hard as it is to believe, I somehow missed seeing ""Gorgo"" in its original U.S. theatrical release in 1961 or any time since then. It's true--I had never seen what many aficionados regard as perhaps the best example of the ""monster rampaging through the city"" film genre. Watching this DVD was a whole new experience for me. I love discovering ""new old"" films that I've never seen before, and ""Gorgo"" filled the bill perfectly.

Making allowances for the 50-plus-year-old special effects technology and the simplistic but consistent plot designed for the less-sophisticated audiences of the time, I enjoyed it pretty much. Kind of a genetic hybrid, it incorporates DNA from the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B00003CXAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>,"" the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B003OUO6UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beast-From-20-000-Fathoms/dp/B002SHN2OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms</a>."" When I watched ""Gorgo,"" I noticed particularly how many of its scenes and plot points I'd seen before in those other films. There's the obligatory underwater volcano that awakens the beast(s), of course. Then the infant but still giant monster comes ashore on an isolated island--sound familiar? Godzilla and the Rhedosaurus ran amok through Tokyo and New York, respectively, but in ""Gorgo"" it's London's turn to have its distinctive landmarks smashed to rubble. In a presumably intentional homage to ""Beast,"" ""Gorgo"" even destroys a roller coaster. Seemingly endless gunfire, rockets and explosions have little effect on repelling the monster. The ending is one of the things that sets ""Gorgo"" apart from its genre-mates, and I found it very satisfying.

The DVD contains the 76-minute feature, an interesting-but-too-short 10-minute behind-the-scenes ""Making Of"" mini-documentary, an animated gallery of mainly advertising art, text biographies of stars Bill Travers and William Sylvester and director  Eugene Louri, and a handful of trailers. The picture quality is, at best, adequate. There's a lot of ""ghosting"" like you see on an old VHS tape that you've recorded on over and over too many times. No one would say the picture is ""sharp,"" and the ""Digitally Remastered"" claim on the case seems spurious. If this is digitally remastered, I can't imagine how bad the original print must have been. The colors are so vivid that they look almost cartoonish in some places (black-and-white would have been better!). The soundtrack is also okay, although I had a hard time understanding the thick brogue speech of Vincent Winter as Sean, the little boy.

All in all, this DVD release of ""Gorgo"" is a good package. The product is not as professional as we may have come to expect from some of the newer multi-disk (and multi-millions-of-dollars) frame-by-frame restorations of classic films, but it serves the purpose well enough. ""Gorgo"" has earned a place in my permanent sci-fi film collection.",1362873600,2,3152,5.966814159292035

It looks a bit better, if you turn the color off, though. The color on the print is horrible! It is such a shame. There has to be a better print of Gorgo, somewhere. It is a neat little film that deserves a better presentation than this. There have long been rumors of a crystal clear widescreen print that has shown up at film conventions and in the catalogs of retail collectors. I have never seen it be available. I hope that TCM or some other such channel will show a better print. I have wanted a great copy of Gorgo for a very long time. It is a favorite from my childhood. VCI did ""ok"" with the packaging and the extras on the disc. I would have liked to have seen Gorgo being carted around on a flatbed truck, in England, as shown in the extras.

""Gorgo"" is the U.K.'s answer to ""Godzilla"".  Unlike Godzilla, Gorgo is a prehistoric creature that escapes from an underwater cavern during an earthquake out in the ocean.  He wrecks havoc on a small Irish island and an English crew of a salvage ship agree to capture him to relieve the Irish of their monster.  The English see this as a great way to make a lot of money by featuring Gorgo as a circus attraction.  Gorgo is captured and brought back to London to be stared at by thousands of curious circus-goers.  Needless to say, Gorgo's mother comes ashore to rescue her son and wreck all kinds of revenge on London.  People who like these kinds of films will have fun watching Gorgo's mother destroy many famous London landmarks.  She definitely gets medieval on the English.

282916,4,6300252310,"MGM presents a King Brothers production -- ""Gorgo"". Those were magical words on a fantastic movie poster that stirred my then very young imagination. Directed by Eugene Lourie, ""Gorgo"" stars Bill Travers, William Sylvester and Vincent Winter. This towering apparition from before the dawn of history (well, close, 1961) comes to Blu-ray in what promises to be the definitive release! This disc by VCI Home Entertainment is reportedly mastered from a long forgotten archival print found in a labyrinthine salt mine film storage facility. VCI has a history itself of bringing this title forward from VHS to DVD and now Blu-ray and must have a soft spot for the beast. The Roan Group made the laserdisc release.

OK, so it's not an Academy Award winner and it doesn't have the best script and it makes use a stock shots and is sometimes way too loud but it does have high sentimental value for its admirers and this is what they've been waiting for -- for a long, long time. It's a story that has some heart in the midst of greed, chaos and destruction. After all, to coin a phrase -- It's like nothing you've ever seen before!

Gone and banished forever are the over grainy, murky releases of the past. This 78 minute film was initially released in magnificent mono and in 1.85:1 widescreen. The cinematographer was Freddie Young and this was made when Technicolor was still Technicolor. Or at least they were still making dye-transfer release prints. I first saw ""Gorgo"" in its initial 1961 release and remember it as looking (mostly) pretty darn good -- aside from some lamentable stock footage inserts. Every video format till now has been sadly lacking one way or another but kudos to VCI for keeping the dream alive.

As an aside, fans may take note of the complete in one volume reprint of Ditko's Gorgo comic books --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Ditko-s-Monsters-Volume-1-Gorgo/dp/1613775520/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Ditko's Monsters Volume 1: Gorgo</a>.

March 21, 2013. And having watched the VCI Blu-ray of ""Gorgo"", I have added the following.

First off, many thanks to VCI for this towering effort in bringing ""Gorgo"" to Blu-ray! This is a *substantial* upgrade over previous home video presentations leaving VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD releases in the ruins. Is it perfect? Not by a long shot. If I could return it, would I? No way! Is it good? Yes, decidedly so!

PACKAGING -- Standard Blu-ray snap case. The cover graphic differs from what I see posted on the VCI/Amazon sites in that ""Shockingly Convincing!"" and ""Incredibly Realistic!"" have been replaced with a couple positive review quotes. Other than that, a dinosaur, explosions and destruction are the focus. Thank goodness they kept the original advertising title graphic on the cover, spine and disc! The disc uses the seldom seen original British quad poster graphic. There is no Criterion-like booklet -- gosh darn.

When the disc is inserted the first thing you see, unfortunately, is a selection of VCI catalog title graphics. Big mistake in my book but at least it's tastefully done.

MENU -- Nicely done (patterned on this film's lobby cards) and legible -- a *huge* improvement over VCI's DVD menu. Audio options include subtitles. Annoyingly, after watching an extra, you get kicked back to the main menu and have to select the extras section again before being able to select the next extra.

VIDEO -- The image fills your 16x9 monitor. Image quality varies from acceptable to pretty darn good. On my screen, I noted the main titles are somewhat off-center to the left and a little low and over bright -- compare to closing titles and/or to the trailer and you'll see what I mean. Color timing is mostly quite good but varies now and then, scene to scene. Overall, the film often lacks Technicolor depth and richness. And most of the daytime shots look like they're printed a half stop bright. Much of this can be attributed to the condition of the print VCI had to work with. Apparently what they had is a print found in an underground salt-mine film storage facility. And, having said this, for the most part, what we have looks pretty darn good -- particularly, the third act's night time scenes. Still, definitely not perfect -- gosh darn. Flaws inherent in the original, such as intercutting sunlit with overcast takes and inserting daylight shots of attacking jets remain. Those readers interested in the film's basic construction may wish to Google ""DVD Savant"" and ""Gorgo"". Great review.

AUDIO -- Dialog is always understandable and clear on this PCM 2.0 release. The score sounds great and the sound effects are good for their time -- just don't be expecting an immersive audio experience.

EXTRAS -- Quite good. For ""Gorgo"" fans, these extras alone are worth the price of the disc.

The ""Ninth Wonder"" making of ""Gorgo"" feature is very welcome though I wish they would have used the title ""Eighth Wonder"" as that is what appears on the advertising of the Dorkins Circus posters in the film -- both at the circus and plastered on the red double-decker busses. (I realize the rationale is that ""King Kong"" is the eighth wonder but lets stick with the subject at hand.)

The trailer is the cleanest-looking ""Gorgo"" trailer I've ever seen on video. Nice.

The stills and pressbook galleries are quite good -- they scroll horizontally, no individual frames though you can use your remote to linger here and there. Still, it's a very good presentation of a rich treasure trove.

The restoration section is not narrated but shows a before/after split screen which presumably indicates how bad a condition the stored film was when VCI got it. There is no indication of the print source for this release, its provenance or the like. This is about as good a release as we're likely to see -- unless a perfectly preserved first generation print or, far better yet, the original camera negatives are discovered at some future date.

BOTTOM LINE -- A big round of applause for VCI! This is a *substantial* upgrade over previous releases! Even with definite room for improvement -- highly recommended.",1358812800,13,6136,4.96588693957115

282923,3,6300252310,"Gorgo shares the director, Eugene Lourie, with two other sea monster films, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and The Giant Behemoth. Lourie, having completed Beast was berated by his young daughter that he was cruel for killing the monster at the end. Thus giving him the idea that his next monster would survive. Unfortunately, the movie's plot seems like it was written by a little girl. The juvenile creature is netted and whisked away from Irish waters and set up in a circus in London. When it's gigantic and angry mother appears, no one, not even the scientists, makes the leap of logic that the big one has come to get the small one. Instead they use every scrap of stock war footage available in the US and Britain to try to beef up what is essentially a boring monster pic. I have seen them all, from the ridiculous Reptilicus, to every Godzilla installment, to THEM and The Thing From Another World, and though the Godzillas get tedious at times, there is usually a twist in the story somewhere, other than the baby-mommy angle, not so in Gorgo. And even that angle isn't put to any use. The momma monster is obviously much smarter than the humans, in addition to being bigger! In The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms there was a palpable menace from the creature, it had deadly contagion in it's blood, which led to an unusual destruction sequence, not so here. Gorgo is trite stale stuff, I hope Lourie's daughter enjoyed it, this one is strictly for the die hard monster lovers.",1341964800,,1481,4.613636363636363

The British 'Godzilla' has many shots equal to the best original Godzilla, so no complaints there. One thing I never noticed before, as the British Aircraft Carrier 'Royal Oak' investigates Nara island, we see stock footage of American panthers taking off, the US insignia clearly visible. Quite a few shots of aircraft were American as well,and some of the panicking sailors aboard the sinking British destroyer also. But at least the Centurian Tanks and Saladin armoured cars were authentic, even if one shot was used at least four times. These are quibbles.

Watch the opening credits and see that some of them are cut off of the screen!  Whomever did this poor transfer should be punished.  It's obvious to me that in spite of the 1:66 mentioned ""Original Aspect Ratio"", this should be more like somewhere in between 1:85 & 2:35, leaning closer to the 2:35 scope.  The sound is TERRIBLE and the picture is Blurry.  For this poor quality i would be ashamed to release it on DVD, it looks like one of those cheap Goodtimes home video tranfers recorded in the extended long play mode! Whatever happened to Digital Quality material?  After all, we are not talking about a one of a kind rare film just discovered that would be impossible to restore properly, like, let's say, ""London After Midnight""!  This is Gorgo, and someone somewhere Must have a decent print in the original scope ratio and running time.  Until then this will gather dust on my shelf!  Great film which deserves more respect than this poor transfer.

The 1961 British Sci-Fi is directed by Eugene Lourie and features the special effects of 2-time Academy Award winner Tom Howard. The monsters are a combination of Godzilla and King Kong, but there is an interesting environmental message in the screenplay by Robert L. Richards and Daniel James.

The real clincher here is the fact that the monster is really a baby lost in the public's eye, and built later as a freak show display amidst a carnival. The scientists discover this fact early on, and predict the worst. Can the parent be far behind? Gorgo, the monster, is easily a contender for the godzilla hall of fame, but both monster parent and the kid, do their job at illuminating the presence of beast. All is pretty ordinary until the parent monster stomps the London town with its big feet. Unlike The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, who at least uses the street to walk, this monster chooses to walk on top of the buildings while knocking everything down in its path, and there is no structure too tall, or electrifying to conquer. The scenes of the massive crowds are up to par, and this is what makes the film entirely enjoyable.

Wether it was stop motion animation or the man in the rubber suit routine like the Godzilla movies. Wether or not you like Gorgo, this movie has the most realistic, incredible special effects out of most of the giant monster films. No stop motion animation here, just an actor in a rubber suit stomping through miniatures. You'll have to squint your eyes pretty close to tell if the London landmarks are models.

Anyways i've had an old VHS copy of this movie for years, but recently ordered the DVD, which i hope is a bit of an improvement in picture quality and sound. I have not seen the widescreen version yet, but am looking forward to receiving my copy as i write this.

Gorgo is an intelligently written sci-fi movie that runs for only 78 mins. It's basically about two men who own a freighter off the Irish Coast who capture a creature that resembles a Tyranosaurus Rex, but much larger. Smelling profit they bring the creature who they named Gorgo(Who is 65ft in height) to a London circus to put on display. What the men don't realize is that Gorgo is only an infant in his early stages of development. A scientist warns them about this, and the possibility that a much larger parent may be around. Sure enough, Gorgo's 250ft mother comes ashore and frees him from the circus after stomping through London and destroying many landmarks to get to her son in a touching seen at the end. The two then head back to the sea and the film ends.",1223683200,,1562,4.458041958041958

This starts out with a storyline that is completely forgotten a few minutes in. This is just a lame swipe of other monster movies. The monster is poorly done and the editing is so poor it's a laugh when the explosions don't match the reactions of the monster. Furthermore continuous repetitions of the same falling rocks is just lazy. Even the ending is a lame attempt to somehow appear poigniant and put monsters in some sort of human light.

There is only about 1 minute of footage in this movie that is actualy worth watching; the scene where the monster destroys the clock tower is very well done...in fact exceptionaly well done, and it immediately stands out...then it just goes back to the same lazy repetative garbage.
I hadn't seen the film before so when I chose this movie for a group of us to watch... I didn't know what I had chosen. It was so lame we didn't even finish watching it!!! We weren't in a rush to go, it was just a boring movie.  And I appologised to the group afterward. They were kind, realizing I hadn't seen it before. Even the the worst of the rediculous Japanese monster movies are more fun to watch then this lame British bulldog.

283024,2,6300252310,"The first thing you should know about VCI's ""Gorgo-Widescreen Destruction Edition"" is that it is missing about 2 or 3 minutes of footage, confirmed by the fact that its running time has been reduced to 73 minutes, although the box lists the full 76 minute version.  The first problem you will encounter when watching the films is during Angelo Lavagnino's excellent opening score when there seems to be an echo effect, as if the stereo tracks where out of sync with each other, resulting in the music becoming a garbled mess.  Such audio problems occur throughout the feature.  Strangely, there seems to have been some additional sound effects added over the original soundtrack.  Except for the missing footage, the MGM Technicolor print used for the transfer is in excellent condidtion.  As a bonus there is a ""behnd the scenes"" documentary that, although it runs only about 10 minutes, it is very authoritative and informative.  The label on the container is an excellent reproduction of MGM's original poster art.  This is one of the worst DVD releases I have yet encounted.

283066,3,6300252310,"I saw Gorgo when it was first released in the movies in 1960 and I'm probably the movie's biggest fan. This 'Destruction Edition' release by VCI is the first serious print of the movie to be sold. The bonfire scene on Nara Island where Gorgo makes his first appearance is restored to visual perfection. It looks like it was actually printed from the negative as do many other scenes in this release. It seems like all the criticism heaped on VCI for releasing the atrocious previous version with its near black scenes paid off. The fans of Gorgo , which are many, deserved and got this restoration. Unfortunately the glee I felt initially with seeing Gorgo finally restored was short lived when the most bizarre thing occurred.
I began to notice the soundtrack was cheaply tampered with in an attempt to guess 'enhance it'. Now mind you I have seen probably ten different video releases of Gorgo all of which had awful print quality but the movie's soundtrack was never ruined or doctored in any way. Now finally we have a decent restoration of the print and what happens some genius at VCI instead of just enhancing the volume of Gorgo which has one of the greatest soundtracks in monster movie history
, they decide instead to do the unthinkable and tamper with it by adding the tinny lifeless roar used in the DVD screensaver and drowning out the masterful original monster sounds in the movie. They also add echoes and assorted sirens and machine gun fire. So you hear machine guns in a scene where three guys are shooting with rifles. These baffling alterations undo much of the great visual restoration VCI made an admirable effort to attain and I have to say ruin the outcome making many key scenes seem to fall out of synch. It's an annoying distraction that sabotages the robust power and flow the movie's sound is known for. A classic is a a classic because of it's special unique qualities that the public loves about them, the best we can do is preserve them not change them. Not to mention the violations of artistic ethics and integrity. Imagine changing King Kong's roar or Fay Wray's scream.
Oh well,maybe this will set up the release of a VCI corrected version. We'll buy it.",1198713600,36,2192,4.652061855670103

The treasure seekers catch him in a net and are ready to turn it over to an Irish University at Dublin. But oh, those sneeky Brits, they want the creature for a circus and offer them much more money. So it's off to the circus for Gorgo.

What is discovered though is that Gorgo is a baby. That can only mean 'big mama' is on the way. Lo and behold, a towering 200 foot lizard comes ashore and destroys most of London looking for her baby. Airplanes, missles, and 3,000,000 volts of electricty cannot stop mama. She retrieves her young and heads back to the sea.

Ah, well, yes, London stands in for Tokyo, but young Gorgo hails from the Emerald Isle, or more specifically, ""Nara Island"", first cousin of ""Oto Island"". The islanders are indeed a surly lot of Gaelic-speaking, sweater wearing, Sasanach-hating fishermen. No women to be seen on the island, which probably accounts for their foul tempers. In fact, there's no woman in a lead or supporting role here, either. Strange - even eye-patch wearing Dr. Serizawa had a girlfriend...... But I digress.

Where ""Godzilla"" was a horrifying response to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ""Gorgo""'s moral center is a warning about avarice and disregard for nature. Young Sean's prescience is consistently disregarded by everyone else, much to their regret. The MST3K guys had a go at this one, but I think they should have saved the ""treatment"" for more deserving flicks. The blue-screen work here is better than Hitchcock's in ""The Birds"", and the miniature work is really outstanding. Sure, it's a ""guy in a rubber suit"" flick, but certainly light years ahead of REAL junk like ""Sting of Death"" or ""Octaman"". Russian-born director Eugne Louri had quite an interesting career, including the outrageous anti-marijuana exploitation flick ""She Shoulda Said No"", and two earlier ""giant lizard"" movies: ""Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" and ""The Giant Behemoth"".

Minor trivia: greedy salvage captain William Sylvester later appeared in Kubrick's ""2001"" as terminally bored space traveller Dr. Heywood R. Floyd.

The underwater scene where Gorgo attacks the diving bell is still a chiller, and ""Moma's"" trip through London to rescue her 65-ft baby is as good or better than any of Godzilla's visits to Tokyo.

283143,4,6300252310,"I first saw ""Gorgo"" as a kid, when it was released theatrically in 1961--in fact, I went to see it several times. To this day, it is one of my favourite ""giant monster on the loose"" films. I suppose the quickest way to describe ""Gorgo""

is to say that this was Britain's answer to Godzilla, Japan's iconic creature of destruction. However, I still find ""Gorgo"" several cuts above most films of this type.

Two rather unscrupulous divers/salvagers (Bill Travers and William Sylvester) capture a huge, prehistoric beast (it looks like an over-sized, aquatic T-Rex) off the coast of Ireland. Ignoring pleas from the Irish government and scientists who want to study this amazing animal, our two ""heroes"" are more interested in someone who will ""show me the money !"" That ""someone"" is a circus-owner in London, where the creature is put on display for the ticket-buying public. However, when scientists do their homework, they conclude that this ""huge"" animal is really just a baby ! Could there be a parent somewhere ? You bet ! ""Mom"" appears--all 200 feet of her--mad as hell, and headed straight for London. Can the Royal Navy stop her ? Fuggedaboutit ! The Airforce ? Just like swatting flies ! The Army ? They might as well use pea-shooters ! ""Mom"" reaches London--trashes the Tower Bridge, Big Ben, Piccadilly Circus etc. before rescuing junior. Memo to Man--don't mess with Mother Nature !

One reason that ""Gorgo"" is superior to similar films is the cast. Travers and Sylvester are both good actors, although child-star, Vincent Winter, steals every scene he is in. Eagle-eyed film buffs will also spot Nigel Green for about five seconds. For 1961, I would rate the special effects as well above average. While both creatures are ""men in suits"", careful editing ensures that your sense of belief can still be suspended. The model work is particularly good--the scenes of destruction are very effective for a 45-year old film. The cinematography is top-notch, hardly surprising when you see that Freddie Young was responsible. Angelo Lavagnino's music score is also to be praised.

""Gorgo"" was directed by Eugene Lourie, the third of his ""giant lizard trilogy"". In 1953, Mr. Lourie unleashed the first film in this genre, ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" (with a lot of help from the king of stop-motion animation, Ray Harryhausen), and in 1958 he attacked us with ""The Giant Behemoth"". ""Gorgo"", however, was the only one in colour.

The quality of this DVD is excellent--widescreen, nice colour. For years I had to suffer with an awful VHS tape--even two different laserdiscs were not a major improvement. The DVD also includes an interesting behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the film, a photo gallery and several biographies. Kudos to VCI also for the cute menu--I will not spoil it for would-be purchasers--let's just say that the scene of London has been ""updated"" !

For reasons of personal nostalgia, I would give this DVD 4 1/2 stars. Younger viewers, used to CGI wizardry, may find the title monsters a bit quaint, but this is a handsome film, well acted and the finale is refreshingly different to many such movies. If you like ""creature features"", ""Gorgo"" belongs in your collection. Recommended.",1136937600,66,3222,4.968460111317254

It actually corresponds to my memory of seeing it on screen years ago as a child. And in fact it is one of the few ""big beast"" monster movies that is geared to the imagination of children, with some precocious  environmental consciousness woven in. The message finally is that Mommy will always protect and take care of you in the end, even it means crunching half of London into rubble.

283175,5,6300252310,"First off, if you are not a fan of classic monster films then don't bother to review them. There are some nonessential reviews that should not be considered relevant to a fan of these films. Most of these frivolous reviews can be easily spotted by the repetitive use of asinine comments like ""rubber suits, bad acting, cheesy special effects"" etc etc. The technology used to create modern films should not be compared with older films like Gorgo. Actually, Gorgo does and amazing job with its special effects considering that it is a forty-one year old movie.

The DVD has some decent extra's including a mini-biography of director Eugne Louri and some production chronicles. The video presentation of Gorgo could have certainly been done better. The print that was used to create this DVD was far from perfect and there seems to be a reddish hue throughout the film. Because this is an old movie we will let all that pass.

 The movie has an excellent musical arrangement that is both frightfully powerful and lightly sentimental.  There are also some amusing goofs during the film that are far from hidden so look for them. (EX: during the Nara Island scenes, the locals use the same gaelic phrase repeatedly in completely different contexts.)

283176,4,6300252310,"This science fiction favorite has been released several times before, on tape, laserdisc, and DVD. Fans have groused for years about the inferior quality of the prints, and with good reason: the original Technicolor film was photographed by F.A. Young, one of the great cinematographers of that era, and the movie itself is a grand, sweeping fairy tale story of mother love, the power of friendship, and destruction on a mass scale.
This VCI release is minted from a lovely print that is a vast improvement over the existing versions, but the new DVD has an altered soundtrack, which can be terribly distracting: some irritating bell noise that repeats several times during the attacks, and the sound of rubble falling has also been inserted. Odd, and vexing. Though it's unlikely this little gem will ever get the deluxe restoration we've seen on Lawrence of Arabia, or The Wizard of Oz, it's a distinct pleasure to see this monster movie presented in this clear, crisp, and saturated version.
If you've always admired ""Gorgo"", this print is a vast improvement, but be warned about those intrusive added sound effects. If you've never seen the film before, take a look, and be pleasantly surprised by the literate script, oddball character relationships, fascinating subtext, and stirring score by Angelo Lavagnino.

283178,3,6300252310,"GORGO is the British edition of the standard 1950's ""Radiation is Coming to Get Us"" film. Actually released in 1961 (fallout travels slowly) it concerns the efforts of a London business consortium to make a few quid off of exhibiting a recently-reawakened 65 foot tall reptilian monster kidnapped off the Irish coast in the wake of an atomic test. A previous reviewer commented on the Irish Republican undertones to this picture, and it is not so easy to dismiss the idea.

The creature is hogtied to a giant barge, towed to Vanity Fair, and put on display in Piccadilly Circus. To this point, GORGO is very little more than KING KONG redone in dinosaur.

The twist comes when we discover that Gorgo is an infant. Not long after, Mama Gorgo swims up the Thames in search of her prodigal son and proceeds to wreck London in much the same manner as her American cousin THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS did New York.

For once, the monsters win as Mama Gorgo and her child batter their way back to the sea, pausing at the close to give us an admonitory roar to quit messing with nature and to leave them alone.

The heavy debt to THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS isn't particularly surprising given that Eugene Lourie directed both films, but GORGO lacks the originality of the earlier film. It also lacks Ray Harryhausen's convincing stop-action animation that made THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS so memorable. The GORGO monsters are British versions of Godzilla (i.e., men in rubber suits) and are alternately equally frightening and stupid looking by turns.

The film isn't helped by its muddy Technicolor (perhaps a de-colorized version might do us nicely), its discontinuitous stock footage, nor by its chaotically-edited scenes of most of the London population fleeing headlong in fear of the monsters (an element lifted straight out of H.G. Wells' novel, WAR OF THE WORLDS). The sound quality is rather inferior, too. The DVD transfer hasn't fixed all these problems.

Still, if you are a devotee of these films, GORGO is a must-have.

Ultimately, GORGO's charm comes down to its homage to a mother's love, even if that mother is 110 feet tall, weighs 250 tons, and has teeth like broadswords.",1118966400,3,2190,4.824

After all, Gorgo is discovered by a salvage vessel on the Irish coast and taken to London for display, where a bigger version of the little fellow, who is a relatively standard prehistoric monster, shows up to level London.  But this film was the last directed by Eugne Louri, the Russian-born French art director and director who worked with Jean Renoir.  Louri directed ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" and ""Behemoth, the Sea Monster,"" so I am pretty sure he was just making a monster movie and not endorsing the reunification of Ireland.  Still, you have to think that the Irish must have found this film more enjoyable than most.
It is easy to dismiss ""Gorgo"" as the British version of ""Godzilla,"" but when it comes to destroying recognizable landmarks this film is without equal until ""Deep Impact.""  Of course, we are talking models and miniatures rather than CGI, but what else would you expect from way back when?  The problem is that the plot is predictable, the human cast is utterly forgettable, and until the monster parent actually shows up the action is too slow.  But then things get rather interesting in a cheesy sort of way as London's landmarks come tumbling down.  Then there is the question of that big monster: we assume it is Gorgo's mother, because we know the maternal instinct is pretty strong, but who can be sure when it comes to telling a monster's gender (and do not even get me started on what should be the name of the big monster).
