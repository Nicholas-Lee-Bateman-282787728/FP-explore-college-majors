We like the fact that the creators incorporated some humor that adults can enjoy. Farkleberry Farm is good clean fun and we can't wait to see the next episode in the series.",1056412800,,347,4.704918032786885

I really enjoy watching it myself - it is funny and well animated. I have written to the producers to encourage them to produce more Farkleberry Farm videos. This is one you will want to buy for your family!",1050364800,,364,4.367647058823529
7961605,5,B0000664O3,"It's always nice to read children's books that have a moral to them, or watch videos that teach something in addition to just having a nice story. That's why I was pleased to watch the video, ""Farkleberry Farm.""
This video titled, ""Wet and Wooly,"" is the first episode in a new children's 3D computer-animated DVD/VHS series. This episode introduces many delightful characters who live on a farm. For example...there's PJ the pig, Doze the bulldozer (who also flies), and Mr. Wally the reservoir dam. In one scene, PJ and Doze promise to visit Mr. Wally again later the same day. But when don't return, Mr. Wally is left sad and feeling lonely. This episode teaches children the meaning of family, friendship, helping others, and keeping promises.
MyParenTime.com recommends the children's video, ""Farkleberry Farm: Wet and Wooly"" -- it boasts a cast of colorful and humorous characters, who teach basic principles that even young children can understand.",1037750400,,955,5.128205128205129
7961606,5,B0000664O3,"We recently bought Farkelberry Farm--Wet and Wooly--for our little son and daughter, both of whom we adopted from China. We didn't know what to expect but were delighted to find that FFarm has zipped past Monsters, Inc., and Mulan as the favorite in our household. ""Fark Farm"" is what they call it. Since both children were orphaned--and are aware of that fact--they feel a special bond with the young lamb who has lost her flock. My daughter has me sing ""Who can count on me?"" to her. Sometimes that reduces me to tears. And both of them--they are 3 years old--come down to dinner saying ""Hungry...must have food"" followed by tons of giggles. If your children have overdosed on Elmo, Barney, and the Wiggles, buy them Farkleberry Farm. It's fresh, funny, and touching. The music is great-you'll find yourself humming the tunes from it. So do it--buy it! You won't be sorry. I'm a real person and this is a genuine review. ...",1036281600,,926,4.6871165644171775
7961607,5,B0000664O3,"After we watched this movie, my 6 year old daughter said, ""That was a good movie!""  The characters are cute, without being sickening and the music is fabulous!  It's a ""kids"" movie that adults won't mind watching.  At my house we're looking forward to another installment.",1035936000,,272,4.869565217391305
7961608,5,B0000664O3,"This a great children's movie.  The first night home, the kids (6, 4, 3) watched it 3 times!  It teaches a lesson (keeping your promises) without being preachy.  As an adult I found that I could also sit through multiple viewing without getting sick.  It's not sappy or annoying (like Barney), and it's just the right length (meaning it is not too long). Plus I'm very proud that it was made here in Kansas City.",1026172800,3,412,4.453333333333333
