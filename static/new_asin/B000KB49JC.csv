2687423,5,B000KB49JC,Andre seemed a bit nervous at first...not knowing how the NY audience would receive him..worry was put to rest after the first song. Again..lots of variety..first time for the Harlem Choir..they can crank it out..and with the rest of the orchestra & singers..all the selections with the Harlem Chorus were a delight to eyes & ears. The guest soprano did justice to The Nun's Chorus..beautiful voice. To say the audience was delighted would be an understatement..I am sure the orchestra & singers were thrilled with their enthusiasm ..some good shots of the city & it's people. For the devoted Andre fans another DVD to add to your collection.,1172275200,30,642,4.953703703703703

8155317,1,B000KB49JC,"Hate Andre Rieu? ... NEVER! But this DVD is something else again. It refuses to play. It's marked the same as other DVDs of his that I bought at the same time, same codes, etc. but This One Will NOT Play. The first copy I returned because the case was shattered. The second one I returned because it wouldn't play. Now I've got a third one and it won't play either. Tempting though it may be, if you do decide to order New York Memories and the first copy won't play for you too -- don't waste your time ordering a replacement. Choose another one of Andre's excellent DVD's and let the concert begin!",1513555200,,600,4.271929824561403

8155321,5,B000KB49JC,"I bought this just because of the beautiful performance of
the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.  But I enjoy
everything Mr. Rieu performs.  He is a terrific violinist,
a consumate entertainer and he has assembled an
extremely talented and personable orchesstra and chorus.",1391385600,,280,5.488372093023256
8155322,5,B000KB49JC,This is a wonderful DVD. Andre Rieu has such personality  - I love his facial expressions and he doesn't act as if he is better than anyone. I would love to have the opportunity to spend time talking with him in a group having a good time! His orchestra is wonderful also. Watching the DVD is the closest I will ever get to see him. I must say too that I caught myself smiling almost through the entire DVD!!,1359504000,2,408,4.1645569620253164
8155323,1,B000KB49JC,Ordered the correct format and received the wrong one. Had to return it with no replacement available. Wish they had what was ordered. Return was very smooth.,1356480000,3,158,4.888888888888889
8155324,4,B000KB49JC,"The one bought from vendor has region code: PAL 0 DVD 9 disk type.  Old Sony DVD player rejected it as none supported region.  The other ""All region"" DVD unit played with no problems.  Windows computer using Nero software played, but has intermittent static and clicking noise every so often.  More songs than the PBS broadcast with Rieu's three tenors and bagpipe performances.  Bonus tracks are interesting.",1245196800,9,409,5.044776119402985
8155325,5,B000KB49JC,"This guy sure knows how to put on a spectacular concert. Wonderful music, colorful costumes, a visual delight to watch. The crowd really got into it as well. Loved the Harlem Gospel Choir, very energetic. I laughed and I cried but at the end of it all felt like I just witnessed something special. Highly recommended!!",1182211200,11,318,4.696428571428571
