3843667,3,B002436WIU,"Seriously?  These 2 idiots hosting a DVD people have been waiting years for?  Guess I'll be skipping their stupid antics and just hoping the profile of the teams is decent.  Some of the matches look good, but the Road Warriors vs. Money Inc. is silly.  There are about 200 matches the LOD have done better.

And where are the Russians?  Tony Atlas & Rocky Johnson?  Valentine & Beefcake?  All of these teams did more than Haas & Benjamin and Los Guerroosoros (or whatever they called themselves)...

Just my 2 cents...",1242777600,6,518,4.666666666666667
3843668,2,B002436WIU,"Tag team wrestling is dead in WWE, so why would they bother to release a half-baked dvd set over it? The biggest tag teams of the last twenty years are all with TNA now including Kevin Nash, Booker T, Dudley Boys, New Age Outlaws, and Scott Steiner. I look at the match listing and there may be a few matches worth checking out but i'll wait to get a used copy. Triple H and HBK shouldnt be on the cover, just anther reason why WWE just doesnt get fans anymore. They might as well put Bushwhackers on the cover. Miz and Morrison host and i'm sure it can get pretty annoying to watch. It's easy to be called the greatest tag team in WWE as they claim when there is no competetion around.",1241481600,2,686,4.165413533834586

3843700,4,B002436WIU,I like that it included some forgotten teams like the killer bees but I would like some more of the classic tag team rivlary matches and less of just showcasing the team aganist nobodies.,1369872000,,187,4.529411764705882
3843701,3,B002436WIU,"Tag team wrestling is an art, a lost one given the landscape in mainstream wrestling today, especially in WWE. This is a 3-disc DVD set hosted by The Miz & John Morrison (who were at the time a good heel tag team) and they are fully in character as they talk about and introduce various tag teams, roughly 50 in all along with plenty of classic matches featuring many of these tandems in their prime glory. The Miz & Morrison segments between the matches are equal parts funny and painful, but for the most part they are kept short. Before each match there's a short highlight package of each team being featured.

Disc 1

-9/23/85, MSG, The British Bulldogs vs. The Hart Foundation w/Jimmy Hart: These two always had classic encounters as they played off one another very well, the Foundation were the heels who cut off the ring targeting each of the Bulldogs. While Davey Boy and Dynamite used they speed and strength to overpower the Harts. Its a good classic contest with nice double team moves and plenty of nearfalls, while Bret covers Davey, Dynamite hits a diving headbutt from the top and covers him to win. 8/10.

-3/21/91, WCW/Japan Supershow, Title for Title Match, The Steiner Brothers (WCW Tag Champs) vs. Hiroshi Hase & Kensuke Sasaki (IWGP Tag Champs): Quite a unique setting here as the Steiners were fan favorites but the hometown team was cheered way more by the Japanese fans. The Steiners use their strength and amateur skills while the Japanese men use some good stiff shots and their own great mat skills. There's some great suplexes and power moves that really keep the crowd pumped and it ends when Scott hits the Frankensteiner on Kensuke and covers to win the IWGP titles. 9/10.

-10/9/87, Houston, TX, 2 out of 3 Falls Match, The Killer Bees vs. Demolition w/Mr. Fuji: Two teams that tend to be forgotten in tag team history and this isn't too bad of a match, the Bees do use quickness, Demolition cuts off the ring and pounds away on either man for a few. Blair jumps off the top, but Ax gets his knees up then covers to win the first fall, but Ax hurts his knee during this. The Bees work on Ax's knee, Smash gets tagged in and soon after gets a dropkick from Jim Brunzell and covers to win the second fall so its 1-1. During the third fall Fuji smacks Blair with his cane a couple of times on the outside, once Jim gets the tag he goes nuts, but ends up getting a cane shot to the throat behind the refs back and Smash covers to win the third fall and the match. 5/10, the match was decent but the commentary team was just horrid and beyond annoying so that brings the rating down a bit.

-6/27/99, King of the Ring, #1 Contender's Match, Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz: A good but quick one here, quick offense and double team moves, Edge hits a spear on Jeff in mid-air. Later Gangrel accidentally spray blood in Edge's eyes, Jeff hits a Twist of a Fate and covers Edge to win. 5/10.

-10/1983, WCCW, Country Whipping Match, The Fabulous Freebirds vs. Kerry & Kevin Von Erich: Good one here as these two just had a natural chemistry which made for a great rivalry, they give and take some hard shots with the lethal straps. The referee has a hard time keeping control of all four men, the Von Erichs are the favorites and the fans go nuts whenever they have the advantage. The match is so out of control that the ref throws it out, but that doesn't stop the brawling. 8/10.

-Championship Wrestling From Florida, The Funk Brothers vs. The Brisco Brothers: Clipped match with two classic brother teams, but since its clipped it shouldn't have been on here at all. 1/10.

-8/10/96, WCW Hog Wild, WCW Tag Team Championship Match, Harlem Heat (Champions) w/Col. Parker & Sherri vs. The Steiner Brothers: Good contest here as both these teams were so great in WCW, both just gel well the bikers in the crowd revving their bikes becomes annoying but the action in the ring stays hot. Its power vs. power, good double team moves and Booker and Stevie cut the ring off, the Steiners won't stay down and they keep coming. The action breaks down at the end, Scott gets wacked in the back of the head with a cane and is covered so Harlem Heat retains. 7/10.

-7/10/88, Great American Bash, NWA United States Tag Team Championship Match, The Fantastics (Champions) vs. The Midnight Express: A special stipulation was added where Jim Cornette was to be placed in a straight jacket then lifted up in a cage at ring side so he couldn't interfere. Its such a great tag team classic, the Fantastics were so underrated as they could wrestle and fly with the best of them. The Express still do well even without Cornette at ringside, cutting off the ring at times. The action gets more intense and breaks down in the final minutes with Bobby Eaton using a chain and covers Fulton to win the titles. 9/10. Afterwards the Fantastics get a few shots at Cornette after he's let out of the cage.

-2/11/96, WCW Superbrawl VI, Anything Goes, Falls Count Anywhere Street Fight, Public Enemy vs. The Nasty Boys: Not a lot of wrestling holds used here, the brawl goes to the outside, plenty of weapons including a table and chair get used. Rocco Rock take a nasty spill off the ropes through a table and its just a fun, fun out of control match. Rocco misses a dive from the up in the crowd, crashing through a table then Knobbs covers to win. 7/10.

-3/18/89, MSG, The Rockers vs. The Brainbusters: I can't recall a bad match these two teams ever had and this is no exception. Its always magic when these two styles meet in the ring. There's some early one-upping by both Shawn and Tully. Shawn slams Anderson's arm into the ring post and he and Jannetty start working on Arn's arm, even doing a slingshot double arm ringer on the top rope. Nice spot with a double figure four leg lock by the Rockers. The finish comes when Shawn hits a splash from the top rope, but Tully pulls the referee out of the ring, resulting in DQ in about 22 minutes. Classic, classic tag team match. 9/10.

(Available on Shawn Michaels: My Journey)

Disc 2

-3/27/88, Wrestlemania IV, World Tag Team Championship Match, Strike Force (Champions) vs. Demolition w/Mr. Fuji: Its speed vs. power, Strike Force hit some quick double team offense while Ax and Smash work on the back's of both men. Santana takes a good amount of the punishment for a few minutes, after getting the hot tag Martel has the Boston Crab on Smash, Ax hits him with Fuji's cane and Smash covers to win the titles. 5/10.

-3/31/85, Wrestlemania I, World Tag Team Championship Match, Barry Windham & Mike Rotundo (Champions) vs. The Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff w/Freddie Blassie: From the very first grand daddy of em all, its a good but quick one, Rotundo shows some good athletic moves as does Windham who both keep up the speed for the opening minutes. Sheik and Koloff use dirty tactics and work over Mike, who tags Barry and he's on fire but ends up getting blasted in the back with Freddie Blassie's cane and Koloff covers to win the titles. 5/10.

-11/18/01, Survivor Series, Steel Cage Tag Team Championship Unification Match: The Dudley Boyz (WCW Tag Team Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz (WWE Tag Team Champions): Both these teams know each other very well having competed in table and TLC matches, but this was their first ever meeting inside the steel cage. Both teams go all out here and Matt does end up escaping and Jeff goes to the top to escape but decides to do a swanton onto D'Von through a table but misses. Buh Buh Ray pins Jeff to win the match. 8/10.

(Available on The Greatest Steel Cage Matches of All Time)

-10/27/96, WCW Halloween Havoc, WCW World Tag Team Championship Match, The Outsiders vs. Harlem Heat (Champions) w/Sherri and Col. Parker: Pretty good one here as the NWO was really in full takeover mode and were looking to capture the tag titles, power for power and Hall and Nash try to intimidate both Booker and Stevie but they won't back down. Nash seems more motivated than he was in most of his WCW matches but he also gets double teamed by both Heat members. There's the build-up to the hot tag and Harlem Heat looks to have the match won after Booker hits the Harlem Hangover, but when Parker tries to help he just hands the cane to Nash and runs off. Nash hits Stevie with it and Hall covers to win the titles. 7/10.

(Available on NWO: The Revolution)

-7/10/88, Great American Bash, NWA World Tag Team Championship Match, Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard (Champions) vs. Sting & Nikita Koloff: This is a good one here with the powerhouses taking it to the Horsemen, who have to play defense for most of the opening minutes. It stays at such a good pace with the crowd remaining hot throughout that you can't help but enjoy it. The closing minutes are great, Sting has the Scorpion Deathlock on Tully but the time limit expires before he submits so its a draw and the Horsemen retain. 8/10.

(Available on Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen)

-12/1972, AWA All-Star Wrestling, Nick Bockwinkel & Ray Stevens (Champions) vs. Red Bastien & Billy Robinson: Old school one here with Bastien and Robinson having the heels on the ropes a few times trying to capture the titles, Stevens and Nick do some classic double teaming and use dirty tactics as well. The pace stays fairly constant while remaining mostly scientific, Robinson hits a back suplex into a backbreaker on Bockwinkel and covers him to win the match. 7/10, for the nostalgia.

-11/17/08, Raw, The Miz & John Morrison vs. Rey Mysterio & Shawn Michaels: Its the A-Listers vs. the dream team and its a good one, Miz & Morrison do quite well as they were always good as a team, using double team moves and grounding both men. Shawn and Rey did very well despite not having teamed up much if at all before this, hitting some good high spots and they played off each other's styles very well. Its a hot match where the crowd is on fire and the pace never slows down, the finish was great as Rey hit the 619, Shawn hit Sweet Chin Music on Miz, Morrison hits a kick on Michaels then attacks Rey allowing Miz to cover and win. 8/10.

-3/7/87, Boston Garden, World Tag Team Championship Match, The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers (Champion) vs. The Hart Foundation: Both these tandems never had a bad match that I've seen and this is no different, its tag team wrestling art at its finest. Very technical, but quickly paced even from Jim Neidhart, the Rougeaus were the faces here and they played it well as the Hart's double teamed on Raymond who finally makes the tag to Jaques (later known as The Mountie). He goes nuts knocking Bret around the ring, locking on a nice rolling arm scissors, then the action breaks down. Jaques has a small package on Bret, but Danny Davis (who was at ringside) runs in behind the ref's back and turns it into Bret's favor who gets the three count and the Hart's retain. 8/10.

Special Features on Disc 2

-The Fabulous Freebirds-""Badstreet U.S.A"" Music Video: Fun and funny classic song here from the Freedbirds.

-8/31/87, Primetime Wrestling, Animal Advice from The British Bulldogs: Cheesy and promo where the Bulldogs show how they receive advice from their mascot Matilda.

-1987, Coliseum Home Video Exclusive, Gene Okerlund Visits the Hart Foundation Headquarters: Nice promo with Jimmy Hart showing how he helps keep the Foundation in shape.

-12/10/88, Superstars, Camouflage, Bushwacker-Style: Out in the woods Gene Okerlund talks with the Bushwackers who pop up out of the ground and cut a funny promo like only they could.

-7/7/90, Wrestling Challenge, Gene Okerlund Interviews Demolition: We here from the tag champs who were three strong at this time with the addition of Crush (the late Brian Adams). Good promo.

-4/11/92, Superstars, The Legion of Doom Returns to Chicago: Great moment here where Paul Ellering cuts a good promo talking about the L.O.D. and what he will help them achieve in the WWE.

-The Cutting Room Floor-Los Conquistadors: A funny segment showing the team of Uno and Dos, who were two guys in gold body outfits and were usually used for comedy in any of their matches.

-10/4/99, Raw, The Rock N' Sock Connection Break Up?: Funny moment here where Mankind is talking to Rock who responds but not to him, just someone on the phone. Great moment here.

-11/5/06, Cyber Sunday, DX and the Meaning of Controversy: Another funny moment where DX is backstage talking about who will be the special guest referee in their tag match, they then run down one of the choices Eric Bischoff.

-The Miz & John Morrison-""Mizfits & Mofos"" Music Video: A decent and goofy video showing some good moments from them as a team.

Disc 3

-8/27/00, Summerslam, TLC I Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian (Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz: The best of the TLC's cause it was the first, plenty of great spots throughout this one, Jeff does his usual insane Swanton from the top of a ladder but crashes and burns through a table. It seemed like the Hardy's were on their way to winning in their home state of North Carolina but Edge and Christian were able to pull out the win in the very first TLC match. 10/10.

(Available on Ladder Match)

-7/9/85, World Wide Wrestling, NWA World Tag Team Championship Match, The Rock N' Roll Express vs. Ivan Koloff & Khrusher Khruschev (Champions): A long one here as its speed and technique vs. power, the crowd loves the Express who do very well as they always did. The Russians grind down and beat up both Ricky and Robert at times, cutting off the ring. After so many close calls, ref bumps and everything else, Ricky rolls Ivan up and covers him to win the titles. 9/10.

-12/18/99, Armageddon, World Tag Team Championship Match, The New Age Outlaws (Champions) vs. The Rock N' Sock Connection: Decent match here, though Mick was near the end of his full time run in wrestling, it was more comedy than anything in the opening minutes. Good showing by Rock who took it to both guys, it went around the ring and even into the crowd. The hot tag is made to Mankind, who accidentally hits the referee, he does get Socko out and uses it on Road Dogg, Al Snow comes in hitting Mankind, then runs at Snow in the entrance way. Rock gets tagged, hits the Rock Bottom goes for the cover but Al interferes again causing a DQ. 7/10. Snow and Mankind fight some, Snow gets the Rock Bottom and the People's Elbow.

-11/5/06, Cyber Sunday, DX vs. Rated RKO, Special Guest Referee Eric Bischoff: The usual funny promo from DX, then Bischoff is shown as the choice for referee and its a pretty good match. Both teams work quite well, Orton and Edge play equal parts defense and cut the ring off working over each man at times. The usual antics and good moves follow from both Triple H and Shawn Michaels, later in the match Edge accidentaly spears Bischoff. Another ref comes down but Eric pulls him out before the three, Edge whacks Michaels in the head with a chair on the outside, Eric sees it but doesn't call the DQ. In the ring Orton hits Trips in the back with the chair, then the RKO on the chair and gets the three count. 8/10.

(Available on The New and Improved DX)

-12/11/03, Smackdown, Los Guerreros vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team: These teams always had great matches throughout the whole 2003 year, this is no different though there was some underlying tension between Eddie and Chavo. However early on they do quite well beating up Shelton and Charlie, but they both come back with some great moves of their own and really take it to the Guerreros, Chavo has a good showing but won't accept Eddie's help, gets a superkick from Shelton but the ref tells him Chavo isn't the legal man. Eddie uses an air filter from his lowrider to his Shelton behind the refs back, then covers him to win. 7/10, Chavo doesn't look too happy seemingly thinking Eddie stole his thunder again.

-4/11/87, Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament Cup Finals, Tully Blanchard & Lex Luger vs. Nikita Koloff & Dusty Rhodes: Before Dusty and Nikita came out, Magnum T.A. was introduced to the crowd, which was emotional as he had suffered a few injuries including one to his neck that ended his career. Dusty and Nikita come out and each hug Magnum with both Rhodes and Magnum getting very emotional as it was a truly touching moment.

As for the match it was a good one, Rhodes and Koloff do well as they work on the Horsemen however both Tully and Lex do target the bad neck of Nikita throughout the match. It stays at a good pace, as per most NWA crowd's this one is hot for the good guys to win, Lex does his usual stalling and power moves, which were honestly all he really knew how to do. Near the end its bedlam, Tully accidentaly nails JJ Dillon instead of Nikita with shoe, Dusty hits a top rope splash on Blanchard and covers to win the match and the tournament. 8/10. Nice how the post match trophy presentation was included.

-8/29/92, Summerslam, The Legion of Doom w/Paul Ellering vs. Money Inc. w/Jimmy Hart: Good match here from London's Wembley Stadium, with a nice entrance on motorcycles and the crowd went nuts for Hawk and Animal. Of course L.O.D. uses the obvious power and street fighting edge while DiBiase and I.R.S. use dirty tactics and technical skills to attempt to keep both men down. Once Aminal is tagged back in its all over as all four men get in the ring, Animal sends Ted into I.R.S. then hits a powerslam, covers DiBiase for three to win the match. 7/10.

(Available on Road Warriors: The Life & Death of the Most Dominant Tag Team in Wrestling History)

Overall while not the greatest presentation, like they could've done away with all the Miz and Morrison segments and maybe used them 3 times a DVD instead of before and after each match. This would've allowed for a little more time to show highlights of the various teams, or perhaps even another match as this would've trimmed a good 10-15 minutes off of each disc. That being said there are some good classic matches here, some repeats and some blah ones, so for match quality its worth it in parts, just maybe skip the Miz & Morrison skits.",1343347200,,18092,4.564292321924144
3843702,2,B002436WIU,"Usually if a WWE dvd has a sloppy or rushed documentary/featurette it can be saved by the matches and extras included elsewhere on the dvd. Not so with this dvd set. The feature has Miz and Johnson talking about a tag-team that includes clips from the team's matches and sound bytes of wrestlers talking about the team, but there isn't an interview of someone talking about the team, the sound bytes are recycled from other wwe dvds! Also, each team is only given about 3 minutes of time on the feature. *claps hands* Good one WWE. If you like structure in your documentary/feature then you won't like this one. Miz and Johnson jump from one team to the next arbitrarily. There is no reason why they go from the Steiner Bros to the Hardys to the Freebirds. The teams aren't divided into ""brawlers,"" ""techies,"" and ""high-flyers."" I have no idea why the feature is messy. It could have been better.

The match listing is a mess too. I guess the reason we aren't treated to the team's ""best"" match is because these matches can be found on other dvds. However, including less than stellar matches to represent the team is a flawed move because the viewer isn't given good evidence from the match to think the team is truly great. To give an example, for the Steiner Bros the DVD has a very mediocre match of the Steiners against Harlem Heat at a Great American Bash ppv. It's not necessarily a *bad* match, but it's definitely not a good representation of the Steiners, you know? This match didn't define their greatness as a tag-team.

If you're looking for a DVD with an excellent documentary on tag-teams that revolutionized the sport and made tag-team wrestling great then this DVD is not for you. If you're like, ""Well I don't like documentaries anyway. I only buy WWE dvds for the matches!"" Well, ""brotherrrrr"" this isn't for you either. There are some decent matches on here and some decent tag-team promos, but nothing spectacular. This dvd could have been great. If you see it going for a couple of bucks here or elsewhere then it wouldn't be a waste of money. I bought it for $20 at walmart when it first debuted. *Sigh*",1340236800,,2126,4.592105263157895
3843703,5,B002436WIU,"I have been waiting for this dvd for years and WWE did not dissapoint. I love this dvd it has all the great tag teams of the 80's and the 90's. The dvd includes the Hart Foundation, Demolition, the Rockers, and my favorite the Legion of Doom. Even though I love this dvd, I think it could have been better. WWE left out a few great tag teams such as, the Dream Team (Brutus Beefcake, Greg Valentine), the orginal Midnight Express (Loverboy Denis, Beautiful Bobby), and the New Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes, Jimmy ""Jam"" Garvin). As far as the tag teams go I like all that they showed except for 3 The Miz and John Morrison, Los Guerreros, and the World's Greatest Tag Team. That was my thoughts on the dvd, now on too the matches.

3843704,3,B002436WIU,"The host of The Miz and John Morrison isn't funny at all.  They annoy me (and not in the good Bobby Heenan bad guy way).  While this DVD does have some awesome wrestling on it, their is no documentary.  I also noticed some key teams left out of this DVD while some thrown together teams or lackluster teams were showcased on the DVD.  I would say this DVD is worth the dollar just because of the Rockers/Brain Buster and Bulldog/Harts battles.  If you are looking for a good wrestling documentary look elsewhere.",1261180800,2,512,4.521739130434782
3843705,1,B002436WIU,"When I first heard about this I couldn't wait for it to be released.  I expected a format like WWE's Greatest Wrestling Superstars of the 80's, but once I saw DX on the cover then I had a feeling the DVD wasn't going to deliver.  DX is one of several teams thrown together purely for entertainment value and nothing else.  There were quite a few teams featured that I would never consider great (i.e. The Smokin' Gunns).

The bios were quick clips (with no real background or history) and then a match featuring the team.  I hate this format.  WWE needs to lay out the DVD like they did with the ""80's superstars"" - bios & history, then put the matches in the extras menu.

It's too bad that the WWE seems more interested in just churning out DVDs expecting that fans will just buy them rather than putting out quality compilations.  I've become a lot more selective due to the past few offerings.",1259712000,4,897,4.426829268292683

3843707,2,B002436WIU,"I would buy this, except DX is on the cover.  I'm sorry, but not happening, DX doesn't belong there.",1253836800,2,100,4.2631578947368425
3843708,5,B002436WIU,"I hear people complaining about this being unorganized and that is my favorite part of this DVD set.  Most sets are in chronological order which means that most people scan past the older matches.  This DVD puts it back and forth so that we have the classic wrestling matches mixed with our new, high flying wrestling matches.  It's perfect.  The Miz and Morrison are great hosts, too because they have the cockiness that all the other memorable tag teams have.  This is the DVD to own if you have any respect at all for the older wrestling.  Buy it, now!",1250985600,2,555,4.5
3843719,4,B002436WIU,"Tag team wrestling has become a lost art in the WWE for the past couple of years but at least WWE hasn't completely forgotten about the past history of tag team wrestling with this release completely revolved around tag team wrestling. This set is hosted by the best WWE tag team (at that time) in John Morrison & The Miz...and if anyone has seen their webshow ""The Dirt Sheet"", you know they can be entertaining & did a good job hosting this set (at least better than Striker & Maria did on Macho Man's). I'll give credit to WWE in that although they couldn't possibly put a match showcasing every single major tag team for over the past couple of decades, they did at least have various highlight reels mentioning various tag teams broken down into different subjects like aerial teams (Steamboat & Youngblood, High Flyers), brothers (Ole & Arn Anderson, Taker & Kane, Vallants, Strongbows, Smokin' Gunns), international teams (Koloffs, Bushwackers, La Resistance), classic teams (Texas Outlaws, Patterson & Stevens, Wild Samoans, Blackjacks), blockbuster teams (Sting & Luger, Hogan & Savage), and other honorable mentions (MNM, Billy & Chuck, Austin & Pillman, A.P.A.).

Matches Include:
British Bulldogs vs. Hart Foundation - Bret Hart said on his DVD that the main events like Hogan & Andre were drawing the crowds during this time period, the best matches were between these two teams and this match can validate that point as it was classic tag team wrestling here with both teams building up the pace throughout the match with good double team moves by both men...including the Hart Foundation pulling off a Hart Attack off the top rope at one point. Great showcasing of the Bulldogs as you had to be impressed with the ""muscle man"" of the team in Davey Boy being so quick & agile himself right besides of Dynamite Kid.
""MSG"" Sept. '85

WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers vs. I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions Hiroshi Hase & Kensuke Sasaki - This was from the WCW/New Japan joint PPV's they would do once a year back in the early 90's. Unique situation here as the Steiners weren't the crowd favorites but it was a interesting matchup as anyone who's seen japanese wrestling (WWE's Chris Benoit or TNA's Global Impact DVD's for example) knows that they have a completely different style that's more ""stronger & stiffer"" so you got a different type of match here than you would normally expect from the Steiners in the United States. I'm glad WWE found this lost gem in the vault as this was a history making match with the Steiners at this time being both the World & U.S. Tag Team Champions in WCW and winning the New Japan's tag team championship, they were triple crown champions.
WCW/New Japan Supershow '91

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Killer Bees vs. Demolition - This match as a good display of storytelling by the Bees & selling by Demolition but overall, it was a nice match but nothing I personally would consider ""DVD worthy""
Oct. '87

Hardy Boys vs. Edge & Christian - To my memory, this was both teams their first real televised matchup against each other. This was more like a preview of their later encounters as it was short but fast paced & non-stop action but the highlight was Edge executing one move that got such a reaction that it's become a trademark of his over a decade later.
King Of The Ring '99

Country Whipping Match: Fabulous Freebirds vs. Kerry & Kevin Von Erich - The rules for this match was that both men in the ring were allowed to use their belt straps throughout the match. The matches between the Von Erichs & Freebirds were always described as wild with a football game type reaction from the crowd...and this was no exception as everything here from the crowd to the in ring action was just out of control from start to finish.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Oct. '83

Funk Brothers vs. Brisco Brothers - This was real short & nothing noteworthy outside of the fact that it's rare footage from the archives.
""Championship Wrestling From Florida""

WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat vs. Steiner Brothers - Well ""Heat"" was the right name for Booker & Stevie here because the crowd was all over them right from the start. Harlem Heat had their best series of matches in WCW against the Steiner Brothers because they just had that natural chemistry with each other. I'll go as far as to call this a lost classic when it came to tag team wrestling during this period of wrestling. One funny side note was to pay attention to Bobby Heenan's commentary since he kept forgetting that this PPV was on a Saturday, not a Sunday.
WCW Hog Wild '96

Midnight Express vs. NWA United States Tag Team Champions Fantastics - When the Rock N' Roll Express left the NWA during this time, their perfect replacements as far as in ring ability were the team known as the Fantastics. The stipulation was that Jim Cornette would be suspended above the ring. This was another solid tag team match here as both teams were young & the match had a faster pace than the opener. With the Midnight Express being one of the original high flyin' tag teams of it's time along with the Fantastics being an underrated team, it was the ""sleeper"" match of the night with Cornette crying & acting scared throughout the match just adds a bit of humor.
NWA Great American Bash '88

Falls Count Anywhere Street Fight Match: Nasty Boys vs. Public Enemy - This was a hardcore feud in 1996 that is constantly overshadowed by the over big main event feuds, storylines, & events that happened during the year. With both teams having a reputation for being hardcore brawlers & with their first match at the Clash Of The Champions getting way out of control, you knew to expect chaos & you got it. Tables were broken, chairs were used, and trash cans were being piledriven on within the opening minutes. They were fighting in the ring, isleway, concession stands using every & anything they could get their hands on. What a wild brawl.
WCW SuperBrawl VI

Rockers vs. Brain Busters - Normally the ex-Horsemen duo of Anderson & Blanchard would bring out the best in the Rockers but this wasn't one of those matches as the Rockers were wrestling a more defensive style throughout the match instead of the fast paced high flyin' style that they made their reputation off of. This would have been a better match to showcase Arn & Tully than it was to showcase The Rockers.
""MSG"" Mar. '89

Demolition vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Strike Force - The power advantage started things off for Demolition right from the start by just pounding on Rick Martel to the point where it took double teaming from him & Tito Santana to gain control with Martel showcasing some power of his own with repeated hip tosses while also working over the arm with armbars. Demolition resorted to the tactics of the illegal man taking a shot at Tito on the apron to gain the momentum & kept it by working him over in the corner for a period of time but Martel was able to get a tag who came in very work dropkicking everyone in sight before catching Smash in the Boston Crab while Tito came back in while Tito tried to help by working over Ax in the corner & Mr. Fuji who got on the apron but that only turned out to be a distraction with the referee concentrating so hard on getting Tito out of the ring because he's the illegal man which allowed an opening for Demolition to not only take advantage but capitalize. The match itself was your typical tag team match but was very important as far as how it began the history making reign of Demolition.
WrestleMania IV

WWE World Tag Team Champions U.S. Express vs. Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff - The first championship match at the first WrestleMania resulted in the first title change here. This match will come off as ""dated"" by today's audience but back then, this had all the elements of a classic ""babyface vs. heel"" match even down to how important a role a manager can play.
WrestleMania
[Legends Of Wrestling: Iron Sheik & Andre The Giant]

Steel Cage Match: WCW Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Hardy Boys - The Hardys were in their home state here as it started off as a regular match with both teams tagging in their partners before eventually evolving into a brawl with the cage coming into play at times such as Matt's leg being hooked at the top & hanging upside down from the cage. Stacy Keibler had a creative way of getting involved when Bubba called to ""Get The Tables!"" but the bigger story here was the conflict between Matt & Jeff as Matt was focused on winning the match while Jeff's mind was on being his usual daredevil self. I know some people compared this to their TLC matches but this was able to stand out on it's own and it wasn't one of those ""bloody massacre"" cage matches but they don't disappoint anytime they're allowed to go one on one in a tag team match and this is the same as well.
As a funny side note, you could tell how confusing it was having so many championships in the company during that time as the production team introduced the Hardys as the WCW Tag Team Champions when they were the WWE Tag Team Champions.
Survivor Series '01

Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat - These teams were almost mirror images of each other as they had the combination of the in-ring worker (Hall & Booker) having a bigger & stronger partner (Stevie & Nash) as Hall & Booker started out as Hall was hip tossed over the top rope at one point before Stevie Ray took a shot on the outside that caused Hall to spit at Stevie before tagging in Nash only for Stevie to take down Nash & give Hall a receipt. Both teams showed that they had no problems bending the rules to their advantage as they used the same tactics against each other such as taking shots being the referee's back & double teaming with Sister Sherri even getting involved from time to time before she got caught by Hall & got a taste of ""machismo"" for her troubles. This was the only time I recall these teams facing each other (which is a crime) as they worked well together & had a very good match.
WCW Halloween Havoc '96

NWA World Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Nikita Koloff - They went to the 20 min. draw here but it was a solid match here from beginning to end. You saw the traits of what made Arn & Tully one of the greatest tag teams as they cut the ring in half & always kept their opponents in control while Sting & Nikita held their own here as well.
NWA Great American Bash '88
[Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen]

Nick Bockwinkel & Ray Stevens vs. Red Bastien & Billy Robinson - Unfortunately, the DVD that I rented this from had a glitch here so I can't comment here but it was nice that WWE decided to use their vault here.
""AWA All Star Wrestling"" Dec. '72

John Morrison & The Miz vs. Rey Mysterio & Shawn Michaels - Well, the hosted the DVD so you figured they had to have a match on here. This was the first time Mysterio & H.B.K. teamed and judging by how they interacted with each other, they would make a great full time team if WWE ever decided to go that direction. Miz & Morrison displayed the good elements here of what makes a great classic tag team here & was able to vibe well here. A good match overall.
""RAW"" Nov. '08

WWE Tag Team Champions Hart Foundation vs. Rougeau Brothers - Although this match/feud isn't as famous as their others, this was a great example of the Hart Foundation in heel mode with the double teaming behind the referee's back & using the referee's count to their advantage. The Rougeaus were always an underrated team who had good chemistry with the Hart Foundation and this was a good lost match.
""Boston Garden"" Mar. '87

TLC Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - This was the first ever T.L.C. match which is the same concept as a ladder match except tables & chairs were also legal & encouraged to be used as well while it should also be noted that this was a homecoming for the Hardy's with them being from North Carolina. You had various crazy moments with all three weapons being legal such as Edge legsweeping both Devon & Matt off ladder, Bubba powerbombing Christian off a ladder, Edge pushing Jeff off a ladder that caused another ladder to catapult into Matt's face, Christian getting a 3D through a table, Edge hitting everyone in sight with a chair, Christian launched into Edge who was sandwiched in between a ladder, Jeff's swanton bomb off a ladder through tables, Bubba going off a ladder in the ring through stacked tables on the outside, Lita getting involved & paying for it, Matt falling backwards off a ladder out of the ring through tables, and Devon & Jeff hanging from the tag titles. This was a ""car crash"" that took your breathe away.
SummerSlam '00
[The Ladder Match; Hardy Boyz: Leap Of Faith]

Rock N' Roll Express vs. NWA World Tag Team Champions Ivan Koloff & Khrusher Khruschev - This match perfectly displays what various critics claimed were the Rock N' Roll Express' key to success and that's being able to hook the fans by being both defensive (like setting up the ""hot tag"") offensive wrestlers (their double team moves like the dropkicks). While this wasn't the quality that you would see from their more famous series of matches against the Midnight Express, this was historic as the Rock N' Roll Express would win their first NWA Tag Team Championships here.
""NWA World Wide Wrestling"" July '85

WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Rock N' Sock Connection - Two of the most entertaining teams WWE had went at it here in a match that was typical of all teams involved at the time with it being non-stop action with a good mix of brawling & wrestling (Rock & Billy Gunn) along with keeping the crowd entertained (Mankind & Road Dogg).
Armageddon '99

w/special referee Eric Bischoff: D-Generation X vs. Rated RKO - Eric Bischoff was voted in as the special referee as DX kept staying one step ahead of their opponents & having fun at their expense causing Edge & Orton to resort to illegal tactics singling out one of their opponents keeping him grounded & taking advantage of the referee as both teams traded momentum in what ultimately came down as an accident by one of the participants that ultimately turned the odds against them.
Cyber Sunday '06
[The New & Improved DX]

World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Los Guerreros - During the period where WWE's tag team division was balancing between non-existent & lukewarm, the feud between these two teams was certainly a highlight...to the point where two of their matches have made it onto other DVD's (Viva La Raza & Greatest Familes). Eddie, as usual, kept the match entertaining with his ""lie, cheat, steal"" antics while Chavo showed why he's still underrated to this day but this was a great showcase for the former Team Angle as they wrestled like the ""Anderson's"" of old to where they picked a body part on both wrestlers & heavily focused on it.
""SmackDown!"" Dec. '03

Nikita Koloff & Dusty Rhodes vs. Lex Luger & Tully Blanchard - Before the match stars, you get an emotional moment as Magnum T.A. made his first appearance since his career ending accident 6 months earlier along with a mini-reunion of with both Dusty Rhodes & Nikita Koloff. This match was good action that you would expect from the NWA at this time with the highlight of the Horsemen being the classic heels they were known to be at that time throughout the match before Dusty pulled off a move that you wouldn't expect from a fat plumbers son from Austin, TX.
NWA Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup '87

Legion of Doom vs. Money Inc. - Although they weren't the champions, these were the two best tag teams WWE had at that time. This was a good solid match all around with Money Inc. being the great mat wrestlers but still cheating heels meshing well with L.O.D.'s powerhouse style...but pay attention to L.O.D.'s entrance, it was quite a sight.
SummerSlam '92
[Road Warriors]

DVD extras include the Freebirds ""Badstreet U.S.A."" music video, Gene Okerland visiting The Hart Foundation (the segment is edited...the full version is on the ""Greatest Managers"" DVD), highlights of the ""Los Conquistadors"" angle between the Edge & Christian and Hardy Boyz, a funny segment with Mick Foley trying to break up the Rock N' Sock Connection, DX talking about the referee choices for their Cyber Sunday match, the ""Mizfits & Mofos"" music video by Miz & Morrison mocking Cryme Time, and other promos & interviews from the British Bulldogs, Bushwackers, Demolition, and Legion Of Doom.

The huge positive here is that was probably the best use of WWE's video vault in a very long time as we got a bunch of rare footage from different federations to the point where some of them were never even released to VHS which gave us some lost classics & historic encounters. The minor faults I found with this DVD set was that it could have been better organized as the matches & profiles seemed to be all over the place instead of some order, most of the DVD extras could have been left in the vault, there was no mention of any ECW teams out of the Dudleys (Sabu & RVD could have gotten a mention) & some of the matches picked weren't the best showcases of the featured teams. However, the one major problem with this DVD is that it's obvious WWE spent some time in the vault to find some of these matches for these teams so you mean to tell me while they're in there that they couldn't find any other matches to replace the ones that are already on other DVD's here. For example, fans of Anderson & Blanchard would already have had the ""4 Horsemen"" DVD that had the Sting/Koloff match already on it so another match could have been used to showcase Anderson & Blanchard (maybe one of their matches from their Brain Busters run). Fans of the Road Warriors would have already had their DVD so the Money Inc. match could have been replaced with another match. Same case with the fans of the Hardys/E&C/Dudleys feud would have already had the SummerSlam Ladder Match so another unreleased match could have been chosen to showcase Edge & Christian just like how unreleased matches were used to showcase the Hardys & Dudleys.

Overall, this was an enjoyable DVD set but it wasn't as good as it could have been so this isn't something I would rush out to get but something I would put on the list as something to check out when you have a few bucks to spare because there are some gems on here worth watching.",1249516800,7,18429,4.559516616314199
3843720,4,B002436WIU,"I honestly don't get all the negativity I am reading in some of these Amazon reviews.  This is an EXCELLENT production.  You can tell most of the people who wrote reviews didn't even watch the whole thing, but rather based their opinions off of the chapter point listings.  Unbelievable.
Anyway, if you are a longtime fan, and you want to add a great DVD to your library, this is a no brainer.  They covered over 50 teams.  I thought the format was fresh, and I had no trouble following along.  Even Miz and Morrison were good.  Clearly, this was made before they split up...but these two were very entertaining together.  It makes me wonder why the WWE broke these two guys up?  As far as the matches go...It was cool to see some of the older matches, like the Briscos match, and some of the WCW matches.  Not all the matches were for me, but its cool to see so much of that vast video library showcased.  I felt this DVD saved me alot of money from hunting down some of these matches on Ebay.
Bottom line, if you want a lesson in tag team wrestling history, you will find this set honors many of the important teams, past and present.  Very entertaining.  Great release!",1249516800,,1172,4.395348837209302
3843721,1,B002436WIU,"Where do I begin with what I think is quite possibly the worst WWE dvd ever. WWE has been MIA in the tag team department for years and I really was hoping that they would put out a DVD devoted to the tag teams for those of us who love tag team action ever now and then.

Well the day finally came, and I am very disappointed. This DVD is not only so unorganized that it bounces you from one era to the next.. but the lack of respect the tag teams are given.. I mean 1-2 minutes background on some of the teams? I don't know what else to say.. WWE dropped the ball here and I wouldn't waste money on this dvd.

this dvd doesn't even deserve a review..",1249430400,,650,3.954198473282443
3843722,2,B002436WIU,"This DVD is basically the epitome of what they call a ""clusterf***"" in the wrestling business. It's basically too much crammed into too little of a space, and no one wins in the end.

The structure of the DVD is as follows: A certain team is introduced with a 1-2 minute highlight video with archived voiceovers from commentators and promos. There are no interviews with the wrestlers themselves, their peers, or current wrestlers who grew up idolizing them - three aspects which have been staples of WWE compilation DVD's for years. The highlight video is followed up by one match highlighting that team, then on to the next one.

One thing you notice from the jump is that you never know what to expect from one match to the next. Each match/tag team is completely random in terms of the era and federation in which they competed. Just as an example from Disc 1, it goes from the Steiner Brothers to the Hardy Boys to the Fabulous Freebirds. That might make sense if these teams were organized into some sort of countdown of the ""Best Tag Teams of All Time,"" but they're not. The organization of the DVD truly boggles my mind.

On top of that, the matches are nothing special. None of these matches were career-defining for any of these teams - probably because those matches are either featured on other DVD's, or there simply wasn't room for them. If someone picks up this DVD having never seen a certain team perform before, they will get only an unfair glimpse of just how great that team was.

I think it would have been a better idea to organize the best tag team matches either by decade or by federation (AWA/NWA/WCW/WWF/whatever). This type of structure has been done on numerous occasions throughout the rest of WWE's extensive DVD catalog, so it doesn't seem like too much of a stretch. I can't imagine why such a completely disorganized and disappointing DVD was put together.",1248652800,21,1890,4.666666666666667
3843723,5,B002436WIU,"Fisrt off, I'd like to point out that some of the people reviewing this DVD set have not watched it in full, because the APA, Minnesota Wrecking Crew, The Valiant Brothers and many others mentioned are indeed included in this set. It does help to watch something before reviewing it.

Secondly, I am more satisfied with this buy than any of my other WWE DVD purchases in the past, such as HIAC and The History of the WWE Championship. There are so many exciting, fast paced matches on this 3-disc set, it makes me fall in love with tag-team wrestling once again; it is that good. I am also happy to say there is a very wide variety of tag teams featured that don't appear in the insert; The Rogeaus, The Smoking Gunns, The Wild Samoans, La Resistance, The Blackjacks, Pat Patterson and Ray Stevens, The Koloffs, Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood, The Valiant Brothers, The Mega Powers, the Rock n' Sock Connection, The Hollywood Blondes, and Dick Murdoch and Dusty Rhodes. There are tag teams that are for all interests included here as well.

I only have two qualms with this DVD set. No Paul London and Brian Kendrick. I don't see how they could put the Miz and Morrison on here with London and Kendrick. They have the longest reign as WWE Tag Team Champions ever. They, along with cade and Murdoch, The Hurrican and Rosey, Crash and Hardcore Holly, and even Too Cool should have been showcased in some way, but they can't include everybody.

Also, the Hardyz showcase match was a 5 minute match with Edge and Christian at KOTR 1999. They have so many great bouts with the Dudleyz and E-C that they could have picked a better match. Why not the match at No Mercy of that year, the epic ladder match with Edge and Christian to end the Terri Invitational. That would have been perfect.

But no DVD is perfect, but this one is damn close. A great buy for wrestling fans of all ages, especially those who love Tag-Team wrestling or would like to learn more about the greatest tag teams ever.",1248393600,2,1990,4.519444444444445
3843724,3,B002436WIU,"This dvd set has some pretty good matches on it. They really don't go into very much detail on the tag teams featured on this dvd set. To me the dvd feel out of date because it is hosted by Miz and Morrison back when they were together as a team I guess. I feel it could of featured alot more tag teams and more matches from WCW, Vince owns all the old footage and this is the best they could give us, what a shame.",1248048000,,415,3.8372093023255816
3843725,5,B002436WIU,"Just as it was with ""The Greatest Stars of the 80s"" and ""The Greatest Stars of the 90s,"" this DVD set highlights some of the greatest tag teams in wrestling history. With each team highlighted, the DVD features some of the best tag team matches from WWE, WCW, NWA, AWA, WCCW and Championship Wrestling from Florida. The only company left out is ECW (with the exception of the Dudley Boyz, but more emphasis is put on their WWE years), but with WWE's new PG rating, it's unlikely we'll see any ECW matches in future releases.

Now many people are complaining about how certain tag teams are not featured such as the APA, Smoking Gunns, Minnesota Wrecking Crew, etc. Not true as these teams and more (some well-known and some not so) are also featured. If you watch it all the way through, you'll be surprised as to who the WWE included. The WWE certainly made use of their extensive video library when they put this set together.",1247702400,,928,4.5568862275449105
3843726,1,B002436WIU,"First of all it does look like some time and thought went into this one, just not enough. Secondly, what's with the cover? DX - Shawn and Hunter have never even won a tag team title! WWE still can't get over itself and put out a quality product without trying to push themselves as the best in the history of the sport.

BTW Michael Hayes can eat it! First he gets into the WWE WrestleMania Legends video game and now on the cover of this?

I know there has been hundreds of pairings to make a tag-team. Some not so memorable to those that were formidable.

I want to talk about the good ones we missed here (keep in mind I mention these because they were really pushed as top tag teams during their time in the WWE/F which means a lot to me).

Action packed (if a little skimpy :( for my want), this DVD collections focuses on some great Tag Teams. I say a must-have for the inner-nostalgic :)",1407196800,,256,4.14
8350278,5,B002436WIU,"I am happy with my recent purchase of wwe: allied powers- the world's greatest tag teams dvd, it features many great tag teams and a lot of good matches over the past three decades.",1394755200,,181,4.352941176470588
8350279,1,B002436WIU,"This dvd set is crap. Why, one Miz and Morrison were both horrible. Unfunny, just a feeling as if they were rushing threw things as fast as they could. I don't know if that was because they were told too. Or they just were bord out of there minds. Over having to go threw one of the worst dvd sets WWE's ever done. No rhyme nor reason to the match selection. No MidNight Express vs the Rock and Roll Express. Which in its self is a compleat sin. When your talking old school tag team wrestling. You must remeber the following teams. RoadWarriors, Four Horsemen of Tully and Arn, MidNight Express, and the Rock an Roll Express. Ultimatly the dvd is simply all over the place. They don't even go for the best matchs of the areas they go into. All the old stuff is compleatly random. There is no expliations of anything, nor anything that gives you any remote idea of what was going on. Only when you get into the more current WWE stuff, do you have any clue. Its pretty much an excuse to promote Paul Levesque's ego. Other than a few matchs on this. Its a worthless set. That you would be better off simply buying other dvds with better matchs on them. Then ripping them into your own best of tag team wrestling dvd set. Honestly this set is a compleat let down for anyone who's watched wrestling for as long as I have. Maybe some of the younger crowd might enjoy this a little. But even they would start to wonder just why the older matchs seem so damn random. Along with the fact its little more an ego stroke for Levesque. Makes me compleatly against anyone spending more than 5 dollars on this. That's with shipping by the way. Its a dvd set that should have been far better. With all the footage and copy rights that WWE now has. They could have done far, far better than what they did. They also could have had better hosts. They should have gone for William Regel and Bobby Eaton, along with Arn an Tully to do it. But then that would require having spent more than five seconds on this. This isn't me being a ""hater"" its be being honest about what should have been far better than what it was. This set should have been more than worth the price it was when it came out. But it wasn't and it still isn't worth what its being sold at.",1378598400,2,2239,4.258215962441315
