8146100,4,B000ILYZ20,Question: Is this the same DVD set as The Mysterious Origins of Man in a shorter version and with a different cover because one set is over 5 hours long and this is over 4 hours but both are produced by UFO TV.,1430956800,,210,3.9069767441860463
8146101,1,B000ILYZ20,"This title has NOTHING to do with Graham Hancock or David Childress.  It is entirely, fraudulently misrepresented, and full of very poor quality copied stock footage from very OLD unknown sources.

The only qualified speaker ""scientist"" therein is Dr. Schoch.  Having reviewed the unedited interview with him on disc 2, he repeatedly politely attempted to put straight several obvious misrepresentations presented him by the producers during his interview.  Regardless, he was intentionally quoted out of context in the main presentation.

This title is a very poor quality production, without academic, scientific, or factual foundation, put together by the producers/editors without valid understanding of their subject matter.  Several completely irrelevant references are made to astronomical terms, geography, archeology and very well documented geologic time, ...all totally wrong, demonstrating a profound absence of logic and understanding by the producers and most of the non-scientist fringe authors being quoted as ""experts"".

The ""Ice Age"" did NOT end in 1,500BC as presented herein.  This absurd notion is pushed as if it were an accepted time frame.  Dr. Schoch tried to explain in his unedited interview, yet they ignored him.  Listening to them in the background of that interview, it seems that they were not even listening to him as they taped it.

This title is entirely unrelated to the excellent research and interesting theories of Graham Hancock, David Childress and Dr. Schoch.  I strongly recommend to NOT BUY THIS TITLE.

We hope that Mr. Hancock will eventually release DVD's of his interesting programs on this subject as presented in his book Underworld.",1282262400,12,1683,5.476744186046512
8146102,1,B000ILYZ20,"I am a huge fan of Graham Hancock and Dr Shock. HOWEVER...this video is a ""get over"" full of really bad photos, sub-par photography, B&W 1950 style video, etc and an unending, unedited interview with Dr Shock. Honestly one of the very worst things I have ever seen on any topic, bar none. And BTW, I still have no idea where the reference to Atlantis is in this mess but I couldn't finish watching the second DVD and will not be watching the third. I would suggest you use what you would spend on this horribly disappointing DVD set and go out to dinner or buy a bottle of wine. At least you won't feel cheated and will have an enjoyable memory.",1275782400,6,645,4.295081967213115
8146103,3,B000ILYZ20,"I haven't watched the whole DVD yet, it's ok.  Good info yet kind of boring.",1273795200,,76,4.066666666666666
8146104,5,B000ILYZ20,"This was a well done documentary on a topic that is truly being muffled being our current educated establishment.  The structural and folk tales of many ancients is to similar to not say there was a connection of an advanced civilization that predates our own. We like to think that we are at the top of the intelligence ladder but this video points to a chance that their may have been a greater, in some areas, civilization that our own and that they had been wiped out by an event of world wide destruction that sent man back to its primitive beginning and to which we are now only catching back up to.  I would give this film a chance.",1268956800,3,639,4.316666666666666
8146105,1,B000ILYZ20,"Having read several books by the authors featured in this DVD, I have to agree with Monday Addams - Robert Schoch, Walter Cruttenden, Graham Hancock etc must have been horrified to see the way their views have been misrepresented.  They agree, in the main, with the 10,000 BC date for the end of the Ice Age, and contend that civilization is much older than is generally believed.

The makers of this DVD seem to be promoting the view of James Nienhuis that the Ice Age ended much later, around 2,000 BC, which is not supported by any scientific evidence that I'm aware of.  Out of curiosity I googled this author and sure enough, he's a Christian fundamentalist seeking to prove the Biblical creation story.

Anyone trying to decide if there's any truth in the legends of Atlantis would be well advised to look further afield, and further back in time.",1245024000,10,853,4.666666666666667
8146106,5,B000ILYZ20,"Awesome information and great bonus material that includes complete unedited interviews and an underwater film archive of ancient ruins filmed underwater that I found truly amazing. I was angered by the one star review that almost led me to believe that this DVD product was not worth my time when the person who wrote the review had only rented one small part of this 3 DVD product. After looking at the five star review, I gave this product a try and found that it was everything I had hoped for, a great 3-DVD set on early ice age civilizations, ancient advanced technology and Atlantis. See all three DVDs, it's well worth the viewing. I don't waist my time reviewing films I don't like. Thanks UFOTV for another job well done!",1242518400,8,731,4.630769230769231
8146107,5,B000ILYZ20,"I found all three discs to be informative and a novel approach to the mysterious ice age civilizations, and explaining the end of the ice age.  I may not have agreed with every claim, but I did find that their logic was compeling and deserved much thought.  In addition, the unique underwater footage was a FIRST that I have never before seen.  On top of all of that, the fact that there were many scientists that had their ENTIRE interview presented was a novel approach to documentary filmmaking that I appreciated.  Perhaps the lone negative reviewer's comments were the result of 1) only getting disc one of a three disc set so they didn't see the 'big' picture; and 2) they only believe one conventional line of logic while automatically rejecting other rational lines of reasoning.",1165104000,17,787,4.764705882352941
8146108,1,B000ILYZ20,"I rented the first of these 3 disks from Netflix as a gamble, since the disk description was so vague I had no idea what I'd be getting.  Unfortunately, I lost the gamble.  The subject of human civilization during the last ice age is fascinating and there is obviously much to discover.  Just don't look for much realistic information here.  The producers take bits and pieces of actual scientific information and warp it fit their ridiculous theories.

The basic premise this set is based on is that once upon a time the environment was different from how it is today, such as the Sahara was once more rainy and fertile, and that the coastlines were once much lower than they are today due to much of the Earth's water being bound up in ice.  Humans historically lived on coastlines and, when the water level rose, remnants of their civilizations were flooded and disappeared.  This seems to be accepted by scientists and gaining in popularity.  But from there the producers go wild.

It is presented as fact than there are dozens of underwater megalithic monuments scattered around the world, such as off the coasts of Japan, India, and the Mediterranean.  Sites have been found but it's certainly no fact that experts agree humans built them.  Then it's stated that, since known megalithic monuments such as the pyramids in Egypt, temples of Malta, and Stonehenge were built starting around 3000 BC, all underwater monuments had to have been built at the same time.  Other vague, unsubstantiated ""evidence"" that I won't go into asserts that the last ice age actually ended and the seawaters abruptly rose not around 10,000 BC but at 1500 BC, which is how those ""monuments"" got underwater.  Correspondingly, cultures such as the ancient Egyptians were actually ""ice age civilizations"".  It is also stated the Great Pyramid in Egypt ""just appeared out of nowhere"" developmentally with no architectural precursors, which is absolutely false.

Further discussion focuses on more vague ""evidence"" that scattered worldwide cultures during that same building period were in touch with each other, traveling the oceans, and mapping the continents.  Here the producers' theories are obviously based on the work of Charles Hapgood, though he is never given any credit.  Graham Hancock is barely mentioned.  This is one of my many issues with the DVD.  Work is not credited or shown or gets perverted to fit the producers' theories.  Another example, Robert Schoch appears in brief clips but I wonder how apoplectic he'll be seeing his ideas twisted and misrepresented.  Schoch, whose work I respect, actually says he is not convinced structures such at Yonaguni off Japan were manmade and his main theories are that Egyptian monuments are actually much older than accepted by science.  Yet here he is made to look like he is agreeing to the opposite and supporting the theories of the producers.

Indeed the ""expert"" who seems most influential to this DVD is author James Nienhuis, who I'd previously never heard of.  He is the one saying repeatedly that the ice age actually ended so recently and all these monuments were built at the same time.  I see here at Amazon he has written an out of print book that presents the same ideas as this DVD.  I see he also has a book titled ""Old Earth?  Why not?"".  Added to his obvious disdain for Darwin (he often sneeringly and ignorantly refers to ""Darwinian"" cultural development), his scorn at the idea of ""cavemen"", and his desire to compress history makes me wonder if he is a Fundamentalist trying to prove correct the Bible's dating of the Earth .  Like I said though, I know very little about him, so my own theory could be wrong.

The first disk is only 47 minutes long.  I may still rent the other 2 out of curiosity.  I do enjoy wacky theories as well as prehistoric cultures and now I know what I'll be getting.  The DVD's are very cheaply and amateurishly produced.  Much of what is shown is either experts talking from their offices, video shot while scuba diving, or stock footage (often inexplicably ancient black and white stock footage) of random workers at random archeological sites or random coastlines.  I can't imagine who would actually buy this drivel. However, if you're a fan of shows like Coast to Coast AM, like I am, it might be worth the rental.",1160265600,21,4311,4.834924965893588
