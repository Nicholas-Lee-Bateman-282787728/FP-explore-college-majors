429434,5,6302098548,"WALKING DISTANCE is probably the best episode ever produced. Gig Young acts out Serling's prose so perfectly that he speaks for every man that ever wished he could go home again. It is a very moving episode. Bernard Herrmann's score intuitively picks up the emotion and heartfelt sincerity that Serling wrote into this story. This was Rod Serling's, Bernard Herrmann's and Gig Young's finest work for any medium. I think it is the finest piece of work ever put on film. KICK THE CAN is thematically similar and also very moving. It examines what it means to grow old and if one must give up the very things that makes us who we really are. It too is a very heartfelt episode, sincere and remains one of the best.",1020729600,5,712,4.5271317829457365
429435,5,6302098548,"Long ago when Television was young there were indeed programs of quality and value. One of the great icons of the era was for sure Rod Serling. Mr. Serling has been gone now since 1975...but his vision and talent and taste for the ironic live on in "" Twilight Zone"" episodes.
In ""Walking Distance"" Martin Sloan( Gig Young) gets to look back on his life in a very special way. A shock to himself when he sees himself, as a boy, carving names into a post on a gazebo..( a gazebo that could have been possibly in Serling's home town of Binghamton New York.
The quagmire of time and space are now imposed on Martin Sloan..and this unique teleplay is one of the best 26 minutes you might see on Television. The montage scene on the merry go round...the field is at first tilted...then corrects itself with a return to Mr. Sloan's reality..Frak Overton, Byron Foulger and Ronnie Howard round out the singular cast.
If this were all not enough, Bernard Herrman lends a most meloncholy score to the whole proceedings. This is what happens when great artists combine talents to produce something timeless.
Some "" Wisp of Memory"" indeed!",1009843200,5,1127,4.64
429436,4,6302098548,"In Rod Serling's classic episode ""Walking Distance,"" Martin Sloan (Gig Young) leaves his car at the gas station and walks into his hometown, where suddenly everything is just as it was when he was a child. In fact, he encounters his younger self (Michael Montgomery), and has to come to terms with the fact that he has not been happy with his life for a long, long time. The episode, directed by Robert Stevens, is one of Serling's best evocations of nostalgia, with a cast that includes Pat O'Malley and young Ronnie Howard. ""Kick the Can"" was George Clayton Johnson's final script for the series, and was the episode adapted by Steven Spielberg in ""Twilight Zone: The Movie."" Charles Whitley (Ernest Truex) and his friend Ben Conory (Russell Collins) are residents of Sunnydale Rest, a home for the aged. Charles becomes convinced that the secret to being young is acting young, and one night he begs the others to join him for a game of kick-the-can. Everyone agrees to join in the game, except Ben. Because this is the Twilight Zone, this is a tragic mistake and one that Ben will regret the rest of his life.  This is an okay episode, but not a classic like the first one on this tape.",1005696000,2,1190,4.586854460093897
429437,5,6302098548,"""Walking Distance"" -- Serling's ode to his childhood in Binghamton, N.Y. -- is extraordinary television. Gig Young is perfect as the world-weary New York ad man who is awakened by the boy within himself.  Notice the faraway look in his eyes while he's eating ice cream at the  lunch counter or the confusion that registers on his face when he meets his  mother and father. The Serling script is autobiographical from start to  finish. I was in a college discussion group in the 70s led by  Serling when  he said that this story and Night Gallery's ""They're Tearing Down Tim  Riley's Bar"" were among his most personal writing. He also credited  Ray Bradbury as an influence, and ""Walking Distance"" certainly  has that Bradbury feel of longing for small-town America of the 20's and  30's. Combine that with the Bernard Hermann music and the Victorian town  set, with a vintage bandstand and carousel, and this is more like a short  film than a TV show. But it is the Serling script and the performance by  Young that make make this sparkle.",947894400,4,1039,4.705555555555556
429438,3,6302098548,"This spin on the old Go-Back-in-Time-to-Visit-Myself story is engaging,  yet suffers from a lack of time or excess of plot concerns. Gig Young was  not the best choice for lead. He shows his love and sense of wonder, but  never convinces us that his real life was all that painful. These  shortcomings are suprising, since the return to the small town of your  dreams was a major theme in Rod Serling's writing.  The story implies that  we need to stay focused on our lives and not try to escape from our  problems, but does not offer a convincing argument as to why we should if  we have the option to bail out for a simpler time in the past. I still  think you should see it. It is one of 6-8 truly autobiographical TZ  episodes.  END",906681600,,736,4.330882352941177

429669,3,6302098548,This is a good romantic comedy.  Drew Barrymore and Justin Long have good chemistry together.  I would have watched it anyway.  But the main reason I watched it was because of Christina Applegate.  Who i will watch any movie that she is in.  Although I have to admit I haven't watched any of the series she has been in.  She plays Drew  Barrymore's uptight sister.  The movie does have some strong language which I feel isn't really necessary.  And after having seen this.

I had never heard of this movie before and I have to say, it really was a great movie.  I like most of Drew Barrymore's movies and love her as an actress, and I have to say that we didn't think it would be as good as a movie as it ended up being and we all were surprised that it was a great movie since we never heard of it and by watching previews on YouTube before we watched it thought it looked like a cute lil movie and I loved it so much I ordered the DVD.

429932,4,6302098548,"Going the Distance is definitely watchable and the supporting cast of Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis giver it a wider appeal than your typical Barrymore chick flick rom com. Those two do play pretty much the same characters they do in Horrible Bosses, We're the Millers and everything their in, but to be fair to this film those two movies which were much more successful than this were made after this one, which came out in 2010.  For me though the casting though does make a big distraction as you are constantly thinking about it.  What your thinking about is, isn't Drew Barrymore way to old to be an intern in a newspaper where she still lives with her sister like a teen or early twenties year old.  Although the actors only have around a five year gap in real life, Barrymore has been playing a twenty something for decades longer than Long has.  This is probably one of the first films where he isn't playing a high school kid or graduate going onto university.  So besides thinking Barrymore is too old to be playing someone in her 20's who you'd think would be mature enough to appreciate a relationship and be able to do the long distance thing easier than her character portrays, but your also seeing her in a cougar type role.  Which makes you think she'd be even more into being in a relationship with a guy in his twenties and not worry so much about the long distance thing.

I also wondered when this was set, at first I assumed this was an 80's period piece with one the Atari game Centipede being in a bar, and two the two main characters both playing it all the time.  Then we go to Long's character's room that has a Top Gun poster on the wall.  But then we have mobile phones, and other references to the modern (well 2010) era, with career dying out phobia in the music label and newspapers industries, which our two main characters have chosen as their dream future professions so the lack of new openings contributes to why they can't leave San Francisco or New York to live in the one city and have to have a long distance relationship.

But other than those distractions, it's a fairly fun movie for either gender viewers.",1453593600,,2150,4.461734693877551

I was in no rush to watch since this was I thought I was getting a brand new unused DVD. Now it's too late for me to return and get my money back.

I thought also they should have made more then one attempt to have phone sex with each other as well,but that's just me. I guess I give this a 4 stars because despite the distance the couple managed to stay stay throughout most of the movie and were very loving and devoted to each other. It seemed like the guy however was making more of any attempt to see her rather then the other way around though. The main actors did a great job at acting however Christina Applegate's Character really got on my nerves after awhile which made it hard to get through the movie.

The film is an honest look at long distance relationships, contains some good humor, and is quite a bit more raunchy than I was expecting. On the down side, it's a little flat in places, and the biggest problem I had is that the supporting cast outshines the two leads in almost every scene. A comedy is only as good as it's stars, and Long and Barrymore were forgettable whenever they were joined on screen by such talented comedians such as Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Christina Applegate, and Jim Gaffigan.

There have been many negative reviews involving the language, crude humor, and erotic scenes but, ladies and gentleman, this is an R-Rated movie and it was not sold to you as anything but that, so I do not understand what the fuss is about.

Done differently, with the money I could have saved I could have bought another video! No problem with service, delivery or product, but I will never buy another item labeled ""Fulfillment bu Amazon"".
As to the movie, I think it is wonderful. The writing is sharp, and the acting is just fine. A great romantic comedy. There are several great scenes (such as when Justin Long visits Drew Barrymore and they get back to her sister's house to get to ""romance"". Christina Applegate and Jim Gaffigan are hilarious.

430576,5,6302098548,"I watched this DVD after taking the Skip Barber one day class at Lime Rock, Connecticut, the same track that is used extensively as an example in the video. I wish I had watched it before, many times over! It is very helpful for anyone taking their first steps into high speed driving on a closed circuit and if you are going to learn at Lime Rock it is an absolute necessity as you can learn the track quite well by watching the video many times. In a beginning level racing class the classroom instruction goes fast. It is impossible to absorb and then make use of the material a half hour later, as you get behind the wheel of the fastest handling car you have ever driven. Far better to let the material sink in beforehand, so your instructors can give you specific feedback instead of generalities.

The skid pad section of the video is great, showing the counter intuitive technique for controlling a spin out. Jerking your foot off the gas might be a natural reaction but as the video shows it is the worst thing you can do. A little added throttle combined with well timed counter steer is needed to regain control. Practicing this many times in your mind will give you a chance of responding correctly when it happens for real.

Track time is expensive even in the small single seaters used in the film. The cars may sell for only $50000 but the cost of support means it's about $1000 and up an hour for an arrive and drive experience. (Quite a bit more if you wreck.) It only makes sense to go in with the maximum preparation so you learn higher level skills during your time on the track. Lots of go kart or motocross time helps. Any instructor will tell you that you need time in the seat to get a feel for the limit of traction. In the video they recommend racing in a less costly league so you are behind the wheel 15-20 hours every year rather than just one or two hours in a faster car.

If you want a demonstration of the difficulty of going in unprepared, just watch YouTube in-car videos of beginners doing an F1 experience at the AGS school in France for example. They don't often get what they were hoping for. Trying to learn a new car, a new track, and a very different way of driving all at once and in a short time is impossible. The students go very slowly or stall out or spin. They would have been happier in the lower powered, more controllable Skip Barber cars.

The video is low budget, dated and has an amateurish feel, and the presenters do not speak smoothly. But they drive smoothly and the information and its presentation come from many years of racing and instruction. The video is exciting to watch because the majority of it is driving footage, much of it with a unique setup that shows you the driver's feet on the pedals. The video shows that Skip Barber is the leading and most popular US race driving school for good reason.",1343347200,4,2868,4.385338345864661

It is nice to see a sweet and romantic movie about the topic of long-distance relationships. After all today many people start off as long distance, especially since the internet brings people together. The movie realistically shows the problems that can occur when two people who love each other cannot see each other every day. It also shows the typical comments of friends on both sides. You can see this movie and either think ""been there, done that"", or you know that you could be there if you tried it.

Justin Long does a few things to show his efforts to be romantic. For example he shows up for a surprise visit, etc., and when you watch these scenes - not only do the female actors in this movie have the ""I wish someone would do this for me"" look in the face - I had that look in my face, too.

The ending is a happy endling, but even the happy end does not come in the typical way.

The most hillarious scene in this film is when Justin Long and Drew Barrymore get caught in the act on the dining table. The way the unvoluntary witnesses react makes me laugh even now although the movie is already over.

Walking Distance, 10-30-1959

A sports car drives fast, then stops at a gas station. ""Fill it up."" Martin Sloan stops for service, then decides to walk to his old home town. He stops at a drugstore for an ice cream soda, still a dime. Life is slow paced, as in past decades. People live in big houses along main street. A boy uses a knife to carve his name in a wooden post. The couple at his old house don't recognize him! A brand new 1934 roadster! ""Who are you?"" He is told to go away from his old house. Martin jumps on a merry-go-round, there is an accident. The boy will be alright. ""I know who you are."" Do people only get one chance? ""Try looking ahead."" He returns to the drugstore. Things have changed. Martin goes back to his car and drives away.

Kick the Can, 02-09-1962

An old man says goodbye to the other residents at an old age home, his son came to get him. But there was a misunderstanding. Boys play ""kick the can"" outside. It annoys some of the elderly, they don't like noise. Does time affect people's outlook? Or is it a way of looking at things? Can you become young by acting young? Will he be put in a special ward? [We now know that some exercise keeps you young.] At night Charles rouses the others to play outside. Are you ever too old to play? Is he serious? Can they leave unobserved? The manager is notified. Who are those kids? Where did the old people go?

The lesson here is that a sedentary life can bring on aging. People should stay active as long as possible. Being in an old age home is like a jail without bars. Living with your children is better than in a home where you wonder who will die next. [Note how few obese people are shown here.]",1327708800,,1709,4.230061349693251

According to the picture, I was supposed to receive a Blu-Ray, a DVD, and a Digital Copy. However, the first item that was sent to me was the Blu-Ray only.  I called Amazon's customer service only to have an ignorant customer service representative try to tell me that I purchased a Blu-Ray, which is just a DVD.  After explaining to this person who was reading the script on her monitor that a Blu-Ray is NOT a DVD, she asked me to read off the ISBN number and then compare it to the number on my receipt.  I confirmed that the numbers matched, so I did not want the same item shipped to me again.  She assured me that she had fixed the problem and she was going to overnight the correct item.  When it did arrive, it was the SAME single disc Blu-Ray AGAIN!  I called Amazon AGAIN and was told that the description of the item was for a Blu-Ray and not for a Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy so they had fulfilled my order.  After complaining that the picture shows differently, she said Amazon was going to have the picture changed and they would give me a $5 promotional credit towards another purchase - you know, so I would have to purchase MORE from Amazon, and not the refund I deserved.

It's been more than a week (today is 1/15/12) and the same picture is listed.  No one has come to pick up the returned Blu-Ray, and I have NOT received the promotional credit.  By the way, I chose this product using the Amazon Mobile App and it has the same picture as well.

430584,3,6302098548,"Real life lovers Drew Barrymore and Justin Long star as young professionals who meet in NYC.  Erin (Barrymore) is a Stanford journalism grad student bent on working for a New York newspaper.  Garrett (Long) is an unsatisfied record producer who doesn't like the bands he works with or his job in general.  What distances itself from other traditional romcoms is that this movie doesn't resort to all the usual clichs.  That is, they don't have a big fight, break up and get back together again.  There are conflicts of course, but they are real life issues that many of us may have faced over the years.  How do you continue a long distance relationship?  Do you chuck a lifelong dream job for romance?  Do you relocate for love?  All these questions are dealt with in a grown up way.  As is the tradition, there are sidekicks on each side.  For Erin there is her overly protective married sister.  For Garrett there is a quirky roommate (of course) and another drinking buddy.  They are played by Cristina Applegate, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis respectfully.  Sudeikis in particular is hilarious.

Of course we know that they are (were, not sure don't keep up) a real couple and I'm sure that helped.  I liked that.  You really believed they cared about each other.  Awesome.  Now the bad news.  This movie was rated R and, personally, I would have liked it much better as a PG.  All of the usage of the F word and other graphic language, the casual use of smoking dope and Justin Long's bare behind didn't make the movie for me.  The story and the acting did.  I know I am old fashioned, and I will agree that those things, in the right setting, do contribute to the verisimilitude of the occasional movie, but honestly, not that often.  Too often it seems gratuitous and related to pandering to the real or perceived intended audience of the movie.  But probably that's just me, I watch mostly rom coms and I like them because they are pretty in just the right ways.  So this movie was predictable in the way that all rom coms are, but it was very well done, the characters were appealing and believable and the story moved along as a nice clip. No need to summarize the plot here, the title says it all, they meet while Drew Barrymore is temporarily working in NYC, she returns to California and they begin the relationship described in the title.  Christina Applegate plays Drew's sister, in what appeared to be an extremely clich&eacute;d and mostly unpleasant although apparently not unhappy (hard to tell) marriage.  Justin Long had the usual oddball friends who provided color (as in commentary).  This movie had the potential to become one of my ""keepers"" (the movies I buy and watch over and over) but it was just a little too crude for my rosy escapist taste.",1317081600,,1789,4.54375

430710,3,6302098548,"Here is an incontrovertible:  long distance relationships are imminently do-able.  Thousands of couples function daily many miles apart, thank you very much, without all the fuss and whining and crying we witness in GOING THE DISTANCE, a rom-com that does, admittedly, have its share of funny moments (thank you Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis), but can't overcome being irritably annoying.  I can see it now:  Oh, that's easy for you to say, some disgruntled reader will grumble; actually, it is easy for me to say.  My last two relationships have been long distance--the second one culminating in wedded bliss.  In fact, I first saw GOING THE DISTANCE as an in-flight movie as I was flying to spend time with. . .my wife.

But enough about moi.

Drew Barrymore and Justin Long blend well and have good chemistry as opposite coast lovebirds Erin and Garrett.  And again, there are some truly funny moments, primarily at the hands of Day and Sudeikis; but I still don't understand why Christina Applegate feels the need to be supremely unlikable as Barrymore's over-protective sister.  The plot moves predictably, we all know what's going to happen, and then a butterfly and kittens ending.  Yet throughout Erin and Garrett's collective tizzy that they can't spend every second of every day together--and how difficult being apart is, sniff, sniff--I felt an overwhelming urge to shout, ""Grow up!"" at my flat screen.

A few reviewers attributed their low rating of the film in part due to the ""bad language"" in it.  Well the film is rated R ""for sexual content including dialogue, language throughout, some drug use and brief nudity"", can you people read...do you not bother looking at a film's rating before you watch it.  If you do not want to watch a film because it has bad language in it then fine, don't watch it, and definately don't give it a bad review for it.

Also, a couple people pointed out that the film was ""cliche""...people pointing out how something is cliche has become cliche at this point.  Let me tell you something: at this point everything is cliche, everything has been done before.  Whether or not it is done well is what I care about when watching a film.

In my opinion this film was well written, directed, and acted.  Yes, there was bad language in the film but guess what? Most 20-somethings swear, I actually liked this aspect of the film...it gave it an added sense of realism.  I personally thought the dialog was sharp and witty, much better written than your average romantic comedy. I like films that have a little edge to them and this film had that.

Regarding the acting, I thought everyone did a very good job.  I don't watch a lot of Drew Barrymore movies but I thought she was very good in this as was Justin Long.  They both are very natural on film and seem to have good chemistry.  I also like that they both look like they could be your neighbor which is very far from standard in these kind of films. The supporting cast was great as well.  Sudeikis and Charlie Day were very solid as Justin Long's friends.  If you saw Horrible Bosses than you know how well they work together.

Now don't expect a lot of belly laughs from this, I found the film to be much more humorous than laugh out loud funny.  That being said, I would rather watch a film that is consistenly humorous than one that has a couple of big laughs but drags the rest of the time.

They are the worst. There must be something they are trying to create that is in the form of copy protection for the DVD. The result? The DVD moves in and out at a constant rate, pixelated, digitized and awful looking. This is the same company who's bright idea is to sell people DVD-Rs for $25 for movies they don't want to produce on a regular basis.

This is easily the worst picture quality I have ever seen in a DVD. It is disgusting. I noticed it and was kind of annoyed, first on ""Inception"". Then I noticed it on ""Going the Distance"" both on Warner Home Video and the pieces began to fall into place.

I am certainly going to call Warner Home Video on this matter and will not buy another Warner DVD until this is resolved. Warner, to me has always had a bad reputation for making crummy DVDs, with high failure rates in Mexico, and this occurrence is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.

Short rant:
This film is rated R.  I have read through the reviews here, about people only watching 10 minutes of the film and turning it off due to language... If you look at the rating on this page and on the box itself, it is rated R for language, some drug use, and sex.  If you are sensitive to the F word, sexual images, drugs, *and* you are trying to watch this movie with your family, then you are doing something wrong.  Also the ""I expected better of Drew"" comments... actors try new things.  Yes, Drew Barrymore has done lots of romcom chick flicks that you can watch with your preteen, but you might take notice that they are by and large PG-13, not R.  If you are sensitive and/or watching this with your family or young ones, it is *your* responsibility to read the rating, not blindly watch a movie expecting it to adhere to your standards.
/end rant

As for the movie, the beginning introduces us to Garrett (Justin Long), who is newly single as a result of a funny miscommunication with his (now ex) girlfriend, and a summer intern, Erin (Drew Barrymore), who is working for the New York Sentinel newspaper while on break from grad school at Stanford.  They meet at a bar and hit it off in a really unique way--over an interrupted game of Centipede; our female lead is the reigning champion on the arcade game's score board, and our male lead the interrupter and runner-up.  It was unusual enough for me to take notice and expect a different kind of movie!  The two leads hit off while a countdown starts running on the 6 weeks Erin has left before her summer internship is over.

Garrett has a conversation in the local bar with his friends before he meets Erin about how he didn't cry over losing his girlfriend, that maybe he didn't care enough about her to do so.  This is something to keep in mind over the movie... I paid a lot of attention to the characters' faces throughout.

The movie tests out different features of long distance relationships: loneliness, texting, skyping, phone sex, jealousy over sexy coworkers, etc.  Probably the most interesting topic addressed by the movie is career vs. relationship.  There is a marked push-and-pull between these two competing interests, and it is interesting how the two main characters resolve this conflict.

So many things give this movie its quirky charm.  Garrett's roommate, Dan, listens through Garrett's walls and tries to DJ his hookups; Erin's sister is a clean-freak and germaphobe; Garrett's other friend has an obsession with snagging an older woman using his mustache; Erin's niece Maya is a little monster (""Maya, STATUE!"" haha); and Garrett has a Top Gun fetish.

Several funny moments punctuate the film and make it a fun experience.  I would recommend this movie to you if you like off-beat humor, don't mind the R rating (language, sex, and drugs), and want to see a a rom-com that takes on long distance relationships.

430793,1,6302098548,"Reading this movie's summary I was excited to see this movie as I had successfully had a long-distance relationship myself, but this movie was pathetic.  The characters were never fully developed, the language with the F bomb every 2 min was ridiculous and unnecessary, the potty-humor throughout the movie appealed to only the youngest of audiences (my tween, for example, was the only one who thought it was funny) and there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters to make the story even slightly believable.  It was so bad that after watching 3/4 of the movie I couldn't force myself to finish it.  My tween and husband finished it, and it was predictably the exact ending we had forecasted after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie.  Drew's sister in the movie (Christina Applegate) was also completely unbelievable: she allows her sister (Drew) to live with her in CA while going to school and doesn't have a fit when Drew has loud sex throughout the house including in front of her and in her kitchen destroying her fresh baked/frosted cake and when Drew passes out drunk on the stairs so her sister's daughter can draw a cat on Drew's face (one of the high points of the movie, sadly).  Drew Barrymore was playing a 31 year old student (which was fine given she's only 35), but in some scenes her bleached blond hair and over-done eye makeup was disturbingly ugly, she looked like a street-walker, not an aspiring journalist going to one of the top schools in the country and working at a reputable NY newspaper.",1300665600,7,1534,4.708955223880597
430794,3,6302098548,"With Drew Barrymore and Justin Long (and some chemistry between their characters), ""Going the Distance"" could have been an engaging romantic comedy. The film, directed by Nanette Burstein (""American Teen""), has also some original ideas and a brief but decent support from Christina Applegate as the heroine's protective sister, but the end result is underwhelming, and sometimes even irritating.

""Going the Distance"" begins with an intriguing premise. While working for a New York newspaper, Erin, (Drew Barrymore) a 31-year-old Stanford grad student, meets a recently jilted guy Garrett (Justin Long) at a bar. They sleep together that night, believing that their relationship will not be a serious one. As it turns out, they are mistaken. Six weeks pass, and Erin has to go back to San Francisco after her intern job is over. Erin and Garrett strive to maintain their love across the country.

Despite its promising start with an interesting concept of lovers separated by a long distance, ""Going the Distance"" fails to make the most of its unique (and immediate to some) setting because of its flat narrative and uneven tone. Garrett's friends Dan and Box are little more than an excuse for vulgar and unfunny jokes that do not belong here.

""Going the Distance"" starts out trying to be something more than just a typical romantic comedy, but loses steam pretty quickly after the nice airport scene before its disappointingly unoriginal wrap-up. This is not a complete mess, thanks to the leads, but is still a lost opportunity for a romantic comedy with originality.",1299542400,,1571,5.1050583657587545

Long's performance is pretty good but Barrymore who is always rather delightful in other films just looks uninspired and cranky in every scene.

This story is not new, but the two leading characters truly seem to enjoy each other's company, and their anguish when (surprise!) they fall in love and realize six weeks isn't enough is real.

The film tries just a bit too hard to be shocking and unconventional with the language, though the phone sex scene is hilarious.  Garrett's best friends Box and Dan are pretty funny, especially Dan, played by Charlie Day (of whom I am a fan from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia).  Christina Applegate and Jim Gaffigan are inspired as Erin's sister and brother-in-law, Corinne and Phil.

I get the ""I'm 30 and I'm behind in my life because I put everything on hold for a guy"" thing, but she seemed like she was trying to be some intense young 20-something.  I really wanted her to act her age, which was unfortunate because all that eye make-up just made her look like she was 40 years old.  Now, I like Drew Barrymore and have enjoyed many of her movies.  But she and Justin Long really seemed like they were in two different age groups.  The chemistry between them was forced and the desperation of a long-distance relationship just wasn't very convincing.  Justin Long was I think a good fit for this role, but I don't think the character development was complete.  He did seem to be just coasting along while Drew was overdoing it, but again I think he was held back by the poor chemistry with his co-star.  I have seen him do terrific work in other movies ('Dreamland' and 'He's Just Not That Into You' are excellent examples), but this movie just had numerous issues all around.

I felt that this movie was trying to be funny in the manner of 'There's Something About Mary' or '40-Year Old Virgin,' but it just wasn't.  The attempts at gross humor (especially all that swearing) were misplaced and forced and took away from the sweetness of the story.  Christina Applegate was just plain mean, and men in general were portrayed as idiots.

Justin Long and Drew Barrymore are super funny in this, not to mention the supporting member of the cast who is also a character on ""It's Always Sunny."" Keep in mind people, this movie is far more explicit than the previews suggest.

The movie starts in NYC where Garrett (Mr. Long) has just been dumped by his girlfriend because he listened to her advice and didn't buy her a present on her birthday not catching the signal that she really wanted one.  He heads out to a bar with his two best friends Box (Jason Sudiekis who has a Burt Reynolds mustache that he refers to as a time machine) and Dan (Charlie Day) tell him what a lousy boyfriend he is.  He goes to play Centipede where he meets Erin (Ms. Barrymore) and screws up her game.  He finds out she has the two high scores he's been chasing and invites her to his table for a drink.  The two hook up at Garrett's apartment and romance ensues.  The inevitable wrench in the romance is that Erin is an intern at a NY paper for the summer and once her internship is up, she's going back home to San Francisco to finish up college.  They decide to keep up the romance long distance and that's the plot of the rest of the movie with them trying to keep the romance going.

""Going the Distance"" is a good story acted-out by a great cast. Drew Barrymore (Erin) and Justin Long (Garret) are convincingly in love and delightful to watch. In addition to the delicious chemistry between those two, Christina Applegate gives a superb performance as Erin's sister.

There's issues of exclusivity, sex starvation, questions of commitments, jobs, resentments, cost issues, holidays spent apart and back and forth teeter tottering. Sometimes I even think I have a relationship with my phone!

Story Spoilers Alert:
Barrymore's character, a struggling journalist spends time in New York for a newspaper internship and meets Long's character at a bar (this is perhaps the biggest stretch of the entire movie as they immediately click enough to ""seal the deal""). Barrymore and Long spend the next few months in the lovey-dovey honeymoon period of their romance and realize they don't want to end things. She flies back to San Fran and he stays in the Big Apple and thus, the plot of the movie: how do you make a relationship work with short-term visits and long-term time apart?

The movie was well-developed, engaging and funny. There weren't times that the story seemed forced or exaggerated. These characters (also real-life on/off again paramours) seemed to genuinely love one another enough to fight for the success of their couple-hood. This movie might not resonate as deeply with those have not had the experience of long-distance love but if you have, it's eerily accurate and spot-on in demonstrating the ups and downs of ""Going the Distance.""",1291766400,,1613,5.106060606060606

STARRING: Justin Long, Drew Barrymore, Christina Applegate, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis, Ron Livingston, Jim Gaffigan, Rob Riggle, Matt Servitto and Kelli Garner

WRITTEN BY: Geoff LaTulippe

DIRECTED BY: Nanette Burstein

Rated: R
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 03 September 2010
Review Date: 13 September 2010

I haven't enjoyed a romantic comedy this much since Made of Honor back in 2008. I'm extremely hard on this genre, due mainly to its overabundance of use, and lack of reality. It's all too often the same formulistic trash over and over. At last - a rom-com that `goes the distance' to meet my expectations, only to continue on and exceed them, is found in Going the Distance.

There's something for everyone here. Odds are you can relate to at least one, if not several, of the joyous adventures of dating and relationships that the picture displays so beautifully. I was continuously bombarded with smiles on my face, brought forth by memories of my personal past that the movie dug up for me.

Going the Distance is rated R and it's filled with vulgarity and potty mouthed adults. But not once, does it play out unnatural. These characters are young, and their behavior reflects that. We buy that this his how they would act and speak and, like the bad words or not - it's still more pleasant to spend over 90 minutes with real people who swear, than fake ones with forced and phony PG - 13 dialogue.

The film starts off in the very sexy city of New York and centers on the relationship of Garret (Justin Long) and Erin (Drew Barrymore). Garret runs into Erin during a night out with the guys. I won't spoil their meet-cute for you, but it was fun and original and offers up the first mouthful of bad language, and they hit it off right away; so much in fact, that they find themselves sitting on his bed later that night. See how adult and realistic? They sleep together, and discover they have amazing chemistry; as do Long and Barrymore. They spend the next six weeks schmoozing all over each other, having us in stitches along the way.

And then just when everything seems to be going so well - Erin has to leave town to move back to San Francisco to finish school. Having a solid career in the music industry there in New York, neither of them even think to suggest that Garret go with her.

We get our would-be sappy airport scene at the end of act one versus the end of the flick, and we appreciate that. It's not over the top either, and it feels right. They don't even show Long's character chasing her through the entire airport, just catching her as she's about to board the plane. No - he finds her at the ticket counter, checking in - located a mere 20 yards from where they said their goodbye. Nice, to the point, and plausible.

They share a moment and agree to try the long distance thing. Now we snuggle into our seats a little more, knowing we're about to have a blast - if we've ever dabbled in the difficulty of such a ridiculous fiasco as a long distance relationship.

Erin moves in with her sister Corrine (Christina Applegate) and Garret makes every effort to come see her as much as possible. One of the prized scenes in the film is formed from an immediate sex session needing to be met first thing, when Garret and Erin walk in the door of Corrine's house. Others include hot phone sex gone cold, miscommunication over the phone, and bad advice from moronic friends.

This movie just worked for me, and I can't wait to see it again. I've been a huge Justin Long fan since forever - like Galaxy Quest forever. The kid is amazing and it's great to see him taking on adult roles like this one, where he's no longer the skinny dweeb who can't get the girl. Barrymore, I'm not real big on, but I adored her in this.

And let's not forget the side characters. Garret's two best friends are a riot and both could easily carry a film of their own in the near future. Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, ladies and gentleman; take a note of their names. Christina Applegate is brilliant as always, and makes you long for the day she's granted a much overdo lead role as well. Her face when she catches her sister being `had' in her dining room, was priceless; as was it in the scene following.

The look of this flick was sensational. Somewhere in-between the work of Woody Allen and Judd Apatow. I love the New York setting in movies, and this one is gushing with it. Match-cut it with California and can you go wrong? First time feature film director Nanette Burstein has formed a perfect movie, and surely she'll deliver us with more of the same, in the years to come.",1285200000,2,4626,4.497020262216925
431173,3,6302098548,"It seems like it has been awhile since Justin Long actually looked interested in acting.  In several recent movies (notably HE'S JUST NOT THAT IN TO YOU), he has seemed bored and a little sickly.  His trademark witty attitude has been strictly by-the-book.  But finally, with GOING THE DISTANCE, he seems engaged again.  Perhaps it's because he's been given a true leading role, or perhaps it's working with the always perky and energetic Drew Barrymore (who actually seems subdued here).

Long's character is a bit of a womanizer.  He drifts from one monogamous relationship to another, blithely clueless at what a lousy boyfriend he is (even though best friends Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day constantly tell him EXACTLY why he is a lousy boyfriend).  But one evening, literally hours after his latest breakup, he meets Barrymore over a game of Centipede, and sparks fly.  They embark on a relationship, and Barrymore tells Long right from the start that she's moving back to San Francisco (from New York) in six weeks to finish her schooling.  She's been interning at an NYC paper, but there are no jobs.  So they agree to just enjoy themselves for the time they have together...but things get more serious, and when the time to depart comes, they cling to each other and promise to try to make their long distance relationship work.

What follows are montages of text, phoning & Skyping misadventures, sticker shock over coast-to-coast airline costs (nicely realistic) and the occasional visit.  Long travels to California to visit Barrymore, who is living with her sister (uptight Christina Applegate) and brother-in-law (nicely played by Jim Gaffigan).

What I liked about the film was that you could feel the strain on the relationship.  The weariness of remaining committed to a person you never see (and really don't even know all that well).  The lonely drinking.  The inconveniences of a 3 hour time zone difference.  Barrymore and Long feel like young adults (early 30s) instead of teenagers resisting the transition to adulthood.  The movie has a grown-up gloss to it.  It is also R-rated, instead of the usual PG-13 reserved for a film like this...and this gives it the freedom to let the script tread some decidedly raunchy territory (although to mixed results).

But for everything fresh in the movie, something else feels tired.  Sudeikis and Day (as co-worker and roommate to Long, respectively) bring little new to the stale ""best friends"" characters.  It's always two guys who never have girlfriends of their own because they have cruder, baser ideals than our ""hero.""  I guess these characters exist to spout outrageous sexual lines and to generally make the lead male look less awful by comparison.  In GOING THE DISTANCE, we get to hear the real, ridiculous reason Sudeikis has grown a bushy mustache and we get to enjoy discovering that Day likes to leave the door wide open when he uses the restroom.  Terrific.

Barrymore doesn't seem to have close friends, so she shares with her older, disapproving and protective sister.  Applegate is a good actress, so the two ladies are convincing together, but the dialogue doesn't cover any new ground.
And I'm going to devote a paragraph just to chew the filmmakers out for casting Rob Riggle.  I've written about this supremely unfunny ""actor"" before.  He gets only one scene in this film, but he's as dreadful as ever.  Just remember his turn as a cop in THE HANGOVER...his ability to bring that tight, raunchy, hilarious movie to a screeching halt with his tazering of Zach Galifinaikis is a testament to his dubious skills...if anyone can mismatch his tone to that of the movie around him, it's Rob Riggle.

GOING THE DISTANCE just mostly coasts along.  It's not actively horrible, has some nice moments and Barrymore and Long do generate some real chemistry.  Sometimes it feels fresh, and at others, terribly predictable.  It's not a very ""feel good"" romance, because the two leads grapple with believable issues.  So in the end, GOING THE DISTANCE never quite manages to go the distance...it's always 3 steps forward, 2 steps back.  It was an okay time at the movies, but quite forgettable too.",1284336000,10,4169,4.956772334293948
431271,5,6302098548,"This movie is hilarious. I caution people not to bring their mother to this one. Lots of sexual jokes, sex, nudity. It was funny, yet sweet at the same time. Loved it!",1283990400,3,167,4.25
431272,5,6302098548,"I loved this movie, which focuses on the budding relationship between 31-year-old newspaper intern Erin (Drew Barrymore) and record producer Garrett (Justin Long).

""Going the Distance"" is a fun, refreshing romantic comedy that is super funny and boasts a terrific cast. I highly recommend it.",1283731200,4,436,5.154929577464789
431273,4,6302098548,"This one resonated with me for a lot of reasons. For one, the 31 year old intern makes sense. I was a forty-something grad student not that long ago, so I can only disagree with anyone who balks at that premise. I lived a trans-continental relationship for way too long, too. Even if this romantic comedy turned to be the drippy sort, I was still prepared to like it.

But it wasn't. ""Going the Distance"" has that same sense of good hard play that Barrymore brought to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whip-It/dp/B002VPTJOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whip It</a>&nbsp;- hardly a delicate little blossom pining for Prince Charming. This is about a relationship between grownups, so there a fair bit of grownup humor here, too, like that bumbling attempt at phonesex. In fact, I haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a very long time. (At least one reviewer called this 'raunchy,' but I respectfully disagree. Even so, people with delicate ears take note.)

Mixed in with the amusing bedroom humor and guy jokes, though, there are real questions and real problems to address in the two-career couple. Without being maudlin or morose, this flick deals with those realities, too. I wouldn't call this high art, but it's much better entertainment than I had any reason to hope for.

431274,3,6302098548,"In character-driven movies, there are always moments at which conversations naturally come to a stop. This is due not only to the screenwriter's dialogue, but also the director's sense of pacing and the timing of the actors. Well-trained audiences can pick up on this; they can instinctively feel when a scene, specifically when a passage of dialogue, should end. For the characters to continue speaking after that natural moment has passed will do little more than turn a scene into an awkward moment. Of all recently released movies, ""Going the Distance"" is the only one I can think of that has more awkward moments than pleasant ones. There are so many instances in which characters keep on talking, even though they have already passed that natural ending point in the conversation. I must have said, ""Please shut up,"" more times watching this film than I have in the past year.

Most of the run-on dialogue is incredibly vulgar, which would have been fine had it worked in service of the story. Watching ""Going the Distance,"" one doesn't get the sense that it could only be told as a foul-mouthed, sexually charged joke fest; the whole thing felt like an exercise in how to make a romantic comedy R-rated. Do we really need a scene in which three guys graphically discuss masturbation in public, and then one of the guys continues the discussion with an old lady he's helping cross the street? How about a scene of the same guy asking for a beer as he sits on the toilet, doing his business? With the bathroom door open? This adds nothing to the film. It's vulgarity for vulgarity's sake. Reliable romantic comedies tend towards a PG-13 rating, and I saw no reason why this film had to be any different.

The setup is as follows. Garrett (Justin Long) lives in New York City and is a talent scout for a small record label. Erin (Drew Barrymore) is a journalism student from San Francisco, and she's spending the summer in New York as an intern for a struggling newspaper. The two meet in a bar, and they immediately hit it off. Erin returns to San Francisco six weeks later, but not before she and Garrett decide to try a long-distance relationship, which will include texting, phone calls, and the occasional visit. Naturally, it proves more difficult than they imagined it would be. As they try to manage the ups and downs of a cross-country affair, Erin gets by as a waitress and lives with her sister, Corrine (Christina Applegate), and her husband, Phil (Jim Gaffigan). She also hopes against hope that there will be a reporting position for her in New York come the new year. This is doubtful, given current economic conditions and the dying status of print.

One of the underlying issues of this film is that Drew Barrymore and Justin Long have absolutely no chemistry. Their performances are decent enough, considering, but never once did I believe them as a loving couple. That being said, I honestly don't know if recasting one or both of them would have made a difference; the material is so flat, coarse, and predictable that it's unlikely any actor or actors could have saved it, regardless of chemistry.

Which brings me back to those insufferable awkward moments. Many are exacerbated by Garrett's best friends, Box (Jason Sudeikis) and Dan (Charlie Day), the latter doubling as Garrett's obnoxious roommate. Watching the three of them together, one idly wonders how they could stand being in the same room together, let alone be friends; Box and Dan are crude, annoying caricatures that no one in their right mind would bother getting to know. They have this maddening tendency to veer off into topics of conversation that primarily exist in low-grade teen comedies. It isn't until their final scene that I could actually see Dan, and only Dan, as something more than comedy relief; in that scene, he says something to Garrett, something both true and refreshing. Why couldn't he have been like that for the rest of the film?

Some of the awkward moments are reserved for Corrine, written as a typecast of the caring sister, the exhausted mother, and the sexually frustrated wife all rolled into one. There's a scene late in the film in her backyard, when she has a few words with Garrett as she barbecues hamburger patties; what begins as a serious and touching declaration ends as a sophomoric verbal gag, effectively ruining the moment. This is what I mean by the natural conclusion of movie conversations. If a character has said everything that needed to be said, and if it has said well, why prolong the moment with a dirty joke that's both unnecessary and unfunny? I suspect that somewhere within ""Going the Distance"" is a pleasant, more refined romantic comedy, a film that doesn't need long-winded passages of dialogue that aim for the lowest common denominator.",1283472000,2,4792,4.803636363636364
431275,3,6302098548,"The latest Drew Barrymore film is a romantic comedy that is unexpectedly raunchy. The movie is reminiscent of Adam Sandler films to the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Madison-Widescreen-Special-Edition/dp/B0009X761E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Madison (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;with a little bit of typical Judd Apatow shenanigans thrown in.

Justin Long and Drew Barrymore have this undeniable chemistry that carries the movie and makes the film enjoyable rather than over-the-top; because of this, the film is pleasant to watch rather than sappy.

Sadly, this movie will have a hard time finding its audience. As a Labor Day Weekend release, it's not competing against much at the box office; however, the movie is too mature for teenagers (it's rated R) and too much of a downer for the twenty- and thirty-somethings. The movie would be awkward on date night - it's inappropriate for the first date and it has strong implications that might prove strange for anyone who is in a long-distance relationship. Although this is not a chick film by true chick film standards, I would suggest watching this film with a bunch of girl friends rather than with a significant other.",1283040000,4,1249,5.745945945945946
431276,5,6302098548,"As previous reviewers have said, here are two of the finest episodes of a TV series known for its exceptional quality & human insight. Both start at the same point: a man looking back on the past, one from midlife, one from old age. Both men have been disappointed, worn down -- their lives haven't taken them to the promised place of fulfilled hopes & expectations. And both are given a second chance, although in very different ways.

In ""Walking Distance,"" Martin Sloan (a superb Gig Young) finds himself yearning for his idyllic childhood, and suddenly finds himself walking through it as a grown man. It's a quiet but powerful story, one that any viewer should find evocative -- but if you're Martin's age, it'll resonate deeply indeed. Not simply a cautionary tale about living too much in the past, it also offers what so many grown men undoubtedly hunger for: the chance to speak with their fathers openly & honestly, man-to-man, each in the prime of life. If you've lost your father, this story will strike an almost unbearably beautiful, bittersweet chord.

In ""Kick the Can,"" Charles Whitley (Ernest Truex) waits out his remaining days in an old folks' home, abandoned by his son, feeling the weight of his years but unwilling to simply fade away. He also remembers his childhood -- but in his case, it's not an unhealthy flight from the present into the past. Charles remembers the energy, the joy, the wonder of experiencing the world for the first time ... and he's sure there's a way to recapture it. The well-meaning owners of the home only see him as an old man, the little that's left of a long life. Charles still knows himself to be the sum of that long life, with all of its sorrows & wisdom.

On the face of it, two obvious lessons that everyone knows: don't live in the past, and remain young at heart. But the writing, the acting, the cinematography, and the music all combine to make these two stories something special, something that remains with you long after the closing credits. There's nothing mawkish or sentimental here, no easy clichs to make everyone feel better. This is the stuff of life, poignant & heartfelt. Most highly recommended!",1253750400,,2173,4.713157894736842
431277,4,6302098548,"As others have said, this is now a couple of decades old and definitely looks it.  I am sure Skippy's fleet has been updated with some modern aero and the like as well, so don't let the older cars in this video dissuade you from trying the school for real.

I attended the Bertil Roos Racing School in summer 2008, and I took this dvd with me to try to cram the info into my brain as much as possible before classes started.  I found it very helpful to have absorbed this material in advance - much easier to understand what the instructors had to say and apply it quickly.

Of course no amount of viewing will really make you understand completely so you just need to get to a school, strap into a Formula car, and do some high-speed laps!

431279,5,6302098548,"What a lineup!.Someone earlier reviewed Kick The Can and said it was no Walking Distance. Well it comes pretty close. The first episode"" Walking Distance"" has been called by many. The greatest television episode ever made of any series. I agree. It's correct. Who didn't want to just cry?.With the way Frank Overton who plays his father,and Gig Young talking on the porch. Imagine talking to your parents as they were when you were 11 years old. The whole episode is like a beautiful dream. I know people who cry every time they see it. It always gets to me. The second episode written by the great George Clayton Johnson,Kick The Can is also awesome. We're talking about probably Twilight Zone's 3rd Or 4th greatest episode. Simply beautiful. I always wondered how George who was just 33, possessed so much wisdom at that age.""Youth could be a way of looking at things,at trying new things,and as soon as people stopped believing in magic,they grow old.""What timeless advice. We can always wallow in eternal youth thanks to this marvelous classic. These 2 cannot  be beat.

431391,3,6302098548,"You will notice that the release date on this DVD is a misleading December of 2004 - which sounded very current to me, unfortunately once I bought it I realized that in reality it had a copyright date of 1987 at the end of watching it. No wonder I saw a Dodge Daytona in there! You see, this ""2004 DVD"" release is really a re-release of a Video Tape from 1987.

If you can get past that fact and you are into on-track road racing - you will find it quite good. It covers all the fundamentals of car control thoroughly as expected. There's also plenty of in-car instruction which is always good too.

I personally am mainly into solo club racing (auto-crossing) in parking lots with lots of cones - for which this video was not as helpful. But, if you're into on-track road racing techniques and long for 1980s quality video on DVD - you'll love it! It is rather unfortunate that it is so dated, because I have all the books and really wanted a high quality and state of the art DVD - which this is not. If you do not have all the books - get those first and hopefully a ""current millennium"" quality DVD will be available soon.

My favorite part of the DVD is most of an entire race at Lime Rock has been filmed from the driver's perspective, and that is an incredibly helpful tool. I would have given it 5 stars, but it is beginning to show it's age. I think Skip Barber's School should do a scene-by-scene remake so I can give it 5 stars!",1151280000,12,669,4.234375
431393,3,6302098548,"I had originally bought the Going Faster book and then bought the dvd. After reading the book and I was pretty disappointed at the content of dvd.

Pros:

- Certain techniques, such and double clutching and downshifting without the clutch were tremendously easier to learn by watching it rather than reading it in the book.

Cons:

- Don't get this dvd if you want to learn more about cars or tuning. Aspects of the car like toe in/out, camber angle, shock absorbers, caster angles, etc. are not covered

- Not as technical as the book. Most people would consider this  a good thing but in my opinion the more info you have the faster you can go.

- The video seems like something created for a PBS special in the 80's. That's not completely negative but I would have liked to seen a more modern day video

Overall, I think the dvd is best for beginner and those who are just starting out. Don't bother with it if you already know some stuff about racing and cars. I would also suggest you get the book if you do plan on getting this dvd.",1121731200,53,1038,4.341968911917099
431394,5,6302098548,"Often called the greatest episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE ever made, ""Walking Distance"" epitomizes the series at its finest.  Everything about the episode is extraordinary:  the script, which is Rod Serling's most personal; the acting by Gig Young, Frank Overton, Ronnie Howard, and the rest of the cast; the direction by Robert Stevens; the photography by George T. Clemens; and the moving score by Bernard Herrmann, which could stand on its own as a concert piece.  Serling's emotional identification with this story of a tired advertising man who revisits his old hometown in a desperate effort to ""put in a claim to the past"" is clearly audible in his narrations, particularly the middle one (""A man can think a lot of thoughts...""), in which he sounds close to tears.  Other reviewers have called ""Walking Distance"" the finest study of humanity ever put on television - and I can believe that this is true.
The theme of ""Kick the Can,"" the second episode on this video, is also that of a mature man reencountering youth (the episode even uses some of Herrmann's music from ""Walking Distance"").  Old friends Charles Whitley and Ben Conroy live at Sunnyvale Rest, a home for the aged.  Abandoned by his son and threatened with confinement by the home's doctor, who thinks him ""senile,"" Charles realizes that it will take a children's game, such as ""kick the can,"" to save him from a fate akin to death.
