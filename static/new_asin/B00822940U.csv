8524174,5,B00822940U,"Remember seeing this on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" on a Sunday night when I was a kid, and never forgot how funny it was. It brings back so many memories of that era and my childhood. When Disney was still ""innocent"" and fun. Was very glad to find it on a used VHS tape several years ago, and now on DVD. The used car salesman skit is brilliant....priceless. Never gets old -  same with this whole feature. Again, just brings back so many memories from an era that's forever gone. If you're a fan I suggest you grab a copy before it disappears for good.",1475366400,,558,4.264150943396227

8524178,5,B00822940U,Great show. Remeber watching this on Disney's Wonderful World back in early 70's. I was too young to drive back then but the footage brings back memories. Really fun movie. Just a note that this movie is a sign of the times; Disney staff must have been caught up with some of the wild things going on in the late 60's.... Makes for even more entertainment....Great Seller with fast service.,1425254400,,390,4.585714285714285
8524179,5,B00822940U,"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid.  I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD so I can show my kids.  This Disney Classic is one that will appeal to anyone who's longed for their driver's license and all the anxiety that goes along with trying to get it.  It's so funny to watch what back then was the ""state of the art"" computer technology in a teenage Driver's Ed class.  The extra graphics are adorable and still charming to watch today.  This is a family movie that all will enjoy!!",1381708800,2,504,4.208333333333333
8524180,1,B00822940U,"Horrible!  Sold only on the facts that it's Disney and Kurt Russell is narrating it!  Other than that it is highly forgettable and very dated.  I can't believe I spent over $5 for it, because in my opinion it's not worth one red cent.  Shame on Disney for suckering us in with Kurt.  He was in so many great Disney classics.  This is NOT one of them.  I would be shocked that anyone under 40 could even sit through the whole movie.  Just plain bad!",1381104000,,448,4.188235294117647
8524181,5,B00822940U,"Ever since the Disney Channel changed its programming years ago, it's been getting harder and harder to enjoy live action Disney classics like this one. Luckily, many of these are available as Disney Movie Club exclusives. Even though the packaging and on-screen menus are poorly designed and there are very rarely any bonus features, I was so happy to see ""Dad Can I Borrow The Car"" added to this collection. I always seemed to catch parts of it on the Disney Channel, but never really saw it all at once. There are a lot of memorable sequences and it's still entertaining.",1353283200,4,574,4.693069306930693
