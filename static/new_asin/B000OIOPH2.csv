8185386,5,B000OIOPH2,It has the famous and hilarious world of warcraft episode. The 10th season is just excellent and a must buy for any south park fan.,1180224000,,131,4.28
8185387,5,B000OIOPH2,"From Chef's startling transformation and horrific demise (or so it would appear ...) to the full-scale war on Family Guy and video-game hackers, and even a Satanic spoiled brat's Halloween party, season 10 is just absolutely jammed full of unforgettably hilarious moments to shock and anger both the atheist and Christian in your family. Though this is definitely a must-buy for every South Park fan (and everyone else for that matter), I can't help but feel like this is the start of a long, slow decline in the series that is evident already after the first half of season 11 (No Christmas episode for two years running?  What's up with that?!)  Still, though, I would reccomend this DVD highly - get it while the gettin's good, as they say.",1179532800,2,743,4.751937984496124
