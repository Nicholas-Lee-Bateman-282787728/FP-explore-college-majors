7170758,4,B00XKJFVDE,"This story had a good plot with lots of unknown elements that come together in the end. Special effects are quite beautiful and the martial art scenes are a mix of ninja style combat and the supernatural. Like the Season Witch, there was a fine line between evil and honor.",1441497600,2,273,4.48
7170759,5,B00XKJFVDE,"If you like Chinese sword and sorcery, you will love this. The story is good, the actors are great and the special effects are amazing. In short, it does exactly what it says on the tin! If you don't think this is your cup of tea, try it. You might be surprised.",1441238400,5,262,4.0576923076923075

7170765,5,B00XKJFVDE,"I cannot describe how amazing and beautiful this movie is. It is a love story, an epic puzzle with demons and gods battling, where demons and gods are not what you think, and the human who gets caught in the middle of it  tries to do the right thing - whatever that may be in the end. The CGI is seamless, so that you are lost in the story and totally buy into the fantasy. The visuals are stunning in blu-ray. And the music is so good, I'm going to go looking for a CD of it and the translation of the song at the end credits. A drawback is the English is subtitles only, but now that I know the story I can watch more of the movie, without losing a frame. Some I just paused to take it all in. If you are a fan of mythology, this Chinese tale will deliver. If you are not, the action scenes and CGI are all you could wish for. Highly recommended.",1439078400,15,848,3.9590643274853803
7170766,2,B00XKJFVDE,"Snow Girl and the Dark Crystal is an adventure about  demon hunter Zhong Kui, whose specialty is vanquishing ghost-like entities. Hes the Chinese mythological equivalent of an exorcist. In a mission overseen by his mentor, master Zhang, Zhong flees with the Dark Crystal, an object said to contain the spirits of all mortals. This theft is engineered to prevent hells soldiers from invading the living world. Zhang helps Zhong develop the ability to shape shift into a powerful ogre, which reveals Zhongs darker, inner being.

Little Snow is a femme fatale from the netherworld who appears in the guise of lead performer of a female dance troupe. She stirs Zhongs memories of a one-time relationship when he was a handsome scholar studying for an examination that would propel him toward power. Shown in flashback, these scenes show that Zhong cynically traded in a bright future because of a lost love. Even though Zhong recognizes Little Snow to be a demon, he is nonetheless smitten with her.

The movie is extremely ambitious, as it combines an elaborate fantasy action epic with a doomed romance. Lots of screen time is devoted to Zhangs constant shepherding of Zhong as he attempts to master his inhuman powers to become the ultimate warrior. Loaded with CGI effects, the picture delivers in the area of spectacle while establishing the fantastical backdrop for its action. Most female characters are portrayed as temptresses who use their beauty and physical attributes to cloud mens minds and control them  a popular aspect of Chinese fantasy. The film is in Mandarin, with English subtitles.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a behind-the-scenes making-of  featurette and a theatrical trailer.",1438992000,6,1713,5.143884892086331

7170768,4,B00XKJFVDE,"A very Chinese battle between a god of heaven, a man, and demons of hell.  Great acting (facial expressions were so emotional), great staging, CGI was amazing in parts, overdone in others.  Snow Girl is so spectacularly beautiful and you can see and literally feel the leads fall in love.  This movie was really, really good.",1494288000,2,325,4.767857142857143

7170774,5,B00XKJFVDE,"Love this ! Bought after first view. Real nice character development and story, Snowgirl is believable as a demon not-wanting -to be- type cast as a demon. And lead male has many sides , also a demon not demon. Though Snow Girl has Lydian attributes that only us over 60 folk remember, I found this movie worthy of watching repeatedly.",1475539200,2,335,4.6

7170782,5,B00XKJFVDE,"Wow. This is such an unexpected nice movie. I was attracted by the title and the cover of the dvd case. It was such a delightful surprise to find a movie so unique in the mythology of Heaven and Hell. Like wow... not your typical Demons and Satan are bad and God and Angels are good movie. I really love the Asians' interpretation of mythical religious beings, making them more complex than even certain humans. If you are into movies based around mythologies and religious myths, or are a fan of Jim Henson films such as The Dark Crystal and Legend, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this film, Snow Girl and The Dark Crystal. My next Chinese dvd is going to be The White Hair Witch. This dvd came with trailers and one of them was The White Hair Witch and I liked the trailer.",1467417600,,763,4.3426573426573425

Does love survive death and is death just one's spirit surviving? Is their heaven and hell or one's personal point of view?
Is all of darkness bad? Is all of what is cloaked in white good? Is there such a thing as all bad and all good?
