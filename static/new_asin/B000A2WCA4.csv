Anne and her husband endured repeated failures with standard fertilization treatments - until a controversial technique called 'cytoplasmic transfer' helped Anne give birth to a healthy baby daughter. Today, the advancing technology of in vitro fertilization has helped thousands of couples create the family they desperately desire. With the assistance of science, a brave new world has emerged where a baby can have five parents, a mother in her 60s or its genes scanned for diseases. Join NOVA for an in-depth look at the revolutionary scientific breakthroughs and their impact on human lives and meet the doctors and biologists on the leading edge of reproductive science. Discover how infertility clinics are tackling the problems of multiple births. And look into a future where parents might one day be able to design their children - selecting embryos not only for their healthy genes, but also for traits like hair color, talent, intelligence and more.""",1226620800,,1075,5.4431137724550895
