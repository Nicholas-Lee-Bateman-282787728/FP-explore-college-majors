The subtitles were so bad that they kept making the people swear too. It was like a bad home movie copy. The seller I bought it from was like ,"" so, what did I expect"".  I was stuck with it. Thankfully I bought my next Korean drama from BLG WORLD and learned what good products and customer service was all about. I recommend them highly. Otherwise my now over 100 dramas wouldn't exist. But if you want this drama look for a YA copy for excellent subtitles and picture quality.  I replaced mine with one. Even used, my copy is perfect. It is the same one my library has. You can find a YA copy by searching YA Korean drama DVD.
The story is of a police officer who goes to Prague to find his girlfriend who is only in it for the money. He meets the presidents daughter and has her translate for him. He is mistaken as a man who propositioned a woman. He does find his girlfriend but she's pregnant with another mans baby. A rich man. Later the police officer and the presidents daughter become friends. She had a boyfriend too, but they are no longer a couple  But there's a lot of story drama and complications in this. Eventually the policeman and the daughter date. It's really better than I can describe. I liked it because it was really different. I checked it out of my library a lot. I originally watched this drama because Jang Keun Suk had a part in it as the presidents son. I was actually surprised at how much I loved the drama itself. All the actors did an amazing job. I was happy to get a good copy of it. If you do decide to buy a YA brand copy look it up under YA KOREAN DVD and then you will find it. I suggest to wait until you can get a good price for a used copy about $40.00. Prices change all the time, I've seen copies as low as $22 before. Look for one with a case, library copies are sold to but do not have the strong cases like the original one or the original artwork. But you can search by title too LOVERS IN PRAUGE.",1522800000,,2114,4.146341463414634
