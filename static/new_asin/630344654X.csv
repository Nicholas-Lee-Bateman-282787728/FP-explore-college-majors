646252,5,630344654X,"This DVD introduced Keith Jarrett to me.
I had just a vague idea about his music before,
and since i purchased this DVD about 8 months ago,
i've listened to his music every single day.
I'm truely in love with this performance, notes and groanings.
""Solar - Extention"" is a real highlight, spanning 27 minutes,
the extention is a middle eastern type vamp, a journey.
""The Cure"" is totaly groovy, ""Butch and Butch"" a great uptempo blues,
All the standards are preformed with the freshness and mastery
typical to this trio and the interaction between the three is
amazing.
WARNING : buying this DVD can (as in my case) cause you to shell
some serious money (after this dvd, i bought ""Keith Jarrett At
The Blue Note, The Complete Recordings"" a 6 cd set, and i'm
currently waiting for the ""Last Solo Concert"" DVD to arrive""",1023667200,3,818,4.609589041095891
646253,1,630344654X,"I am still in awe of what I just witnessed on this DVD.  Here is an extremely talented jazz pianist playing his butt off [he rises from the stool regularly] :) ..only to poison his performance and talent with awful grunts, yelps, and moanings that in no way add any value whatsoever.  It just baffles me that Keith developed this horrible habit alongside fantastic piano chops!  Did he think he needed some sort of gimmick to be noticed?  You'd think someone somewhere along the way would have coached him...""Hey Keith, you gotta drop that whining during your tunes...you'll lose a lot of fans if you keep that up!"" I even wonder how the other fine musicians on this DVD feel about being associated with him.  They play like they don't even notice it, but I'll bet they hate it like I do.  Despite the great sound and efforts by the trio don't buy this DVD if you expect the typical jazz experience you find on other DVDs.",1014076800,4,922,4.491017964071856

646255,5,630344654X,"I was surprised to see that Keith is now also recording on DVD. As soon as I saw it, I immediately went out and ordered it.
I've enjoyed listening to and watching Keith play all my life. His talent, and his utilization of his talent is beyond superlative description. And his recordings with the trio are always masterful. It's a true joy to be able to see their performance on DVD. I hope to see more of the same, as well as solo and classical performances in the near future. A SEVEN STAR PERFORMANCE.",1006214400,2,503,4.361702127659575
646256,4,630344654X,"Keith Jarrett Trio Live at Open Theater East is the next best thing to being there.  The DVD release features an uncompressed PCM stereo soundtrack (in addition to the standard Dolby 5.1 surround) that is as crisp and clean as it gets.  This is one of the best sounding DVD concert releases I have heard.
The performance is stellar.  Peacock, in particular, really shows how sympatico he is with Jarrett and DeJohnette, eliciting lots of smiles (and Jarrett's signature groans and hollers) from both.
It's a very well put-together program, with the highlights being Solar, Oleo and Keith Jarrett's original, The Cure. Presented with no interruptions, it's pretty much like being there.  The filming is simple, with good coverage of all trio members, without some of the quick cuts that I find irritating in some concert recordings.  If you are a player, you'll get plenty of chances to watch the musician who interests you, without the others being sacrificed.
Well worth the buy.",998524800,15,980,4.987730061349693
646257,5,630344654X,"Okay, I think all KJ fans (at least those worth their salt) have already gotten to the point where the moaning and gesticulations no longer detract from the music. There might have been like 2 or 3 days in there (before the light of divine intervention shone down upon me from musical heaven) where I thought the sounds were strange, but that's it. Bottom line, the concert is AMAZING, and if you can't get past the intermittent noises, you ain't a fan of Keith Jarrett",998006400,5,469,4.529411764705882
646258,2,630344654X,"Okay, first of all, I'll agree with the other reviewers: the musicianship of these three men is astounding, their musical choices interesting, the technical aspects of this recording exceptional. So why the two-star review? The annoying habits of one Keith Jarrett.
The man makes noises that distract and detract from the performance. Imagine a Warner Brothers cartoon bee humming and buzzing through his nose for the whole concert - That's Jarrett. I'll be the first to admit that I found (find?) Glenn Gould's humming on all of his recordings more than a little charming. But Gould was always subtle, and in key - something that Jarrett cannot manage.
I do agree with the other reviewers regarding the positive qualities. I do, however question their hearing (or systems) if they are not distracted by Jarrett's noise-making. it's as if one were invited to watch a master chef at work, only to see him pick his nose during the food's preparation.",997660800,5,948,4.968553459119497
646259,5,630344654X,"Typically excellent concert by Jarrett / Peacock / De Johnette performed at an open theatre on a wet day in July 1993. Numbers played: ""In Your Own Sweet Way"", ""Butch And Butch"", ""Basin Street  Blues"", ""If I Were A Bell"", ""Oleo"", ""Bye Bye  Blackbird"", ""The Cure"", ""I Thought About You"" and  a 26 minute ""Solar - Extension"" in which I finally get to see how  the ever-inventive De Johnette makes some of his unique sounds. Deceptively  easily, that's how!. Amusing to see the audience sitting motionless out in  the gloom while these guys give it everything! We know, of course, that the  Japanese love the music and revere the musicians (and they do respond when  appropriate, by the way!) but it does look funny. Two hours of this  wonderful trio in concert. It's a buy!",958694400,10,771,4.651851851851852
646260,5,630344654X,"Watching these three artisits is a rare treat. They play with a level of musicianship, presence, surrender and selflessness that is extremely rare. In some pieces one wathches them becoming possessed in every cell of their  being by the music, much of it clearly improvised. Watching this affects  one deeply. Thank you!",954288000,7,320,5.134615384615385

7847144,1,630344654X,"All the other five-star reviews ... they're right.  Keith Jarrett is a genius.

Keith Jarrett obviously knows how to play the piano.  I have no beef with his playing.  My complaint ... and the reason I got rid of all but one or two of my many Keith Jarrett CDs is that nauseating whining noise he makes when he plays.  He sounds like a martian singing along to his own tunes ... and it's not even in tune.  It's like a nasal whee-whee-whee-whee-whee sound that just keeps time, all the same note.

Heck, even that one note doesn't seem to be in key.

Sort of reminds me of Curly from the Three Stooges when he sings in the shower, fully clothed in a suit.  La la leeeee.  (As he scrubs the armpits of his blazer with soap.)

Keith, I beg of you.  Stop ruining album after album and video after video with these sickening sound effects.

I dropped a large number of your CDs off at the used CD place and traded them 2 for 1 for Chick Corea stuff.  Great music, equally substantial (if you get the right albums), and the man is wholly considerate of his audiences by delivering a professional performance minus the self-indulgent nasal racket.

Neee-neee-nee-neeeee.  Whee-weeeee-wheeeee-neee-neee.

Yeah, that's deep, Keith.

Completely ruins this DVD and makes it, in my opinion, unwatchable and unlistenable.  Downright agonizing.

I'm glad I rented it before buying it.  It would definitely be on the way back for a refund.",1299283200,4,1425,4.642570281124498
7847145,5,630344654X,"People who knock Keith Jarrett's voice over just don't understand that playing jazz is a very emotional experience. Singing whilst playing is not new--Lionel Hampton, Art Blakely,Oscar Peterson just to name a few, do it. Accept it as the artist's total commitment to what he / she is playing. I am sure when most people listen to live jazz they tap their feet or snap their fingers. Jarrett's groans et al are no different. Man, stop nit picking and just listen to one hell of a talent giving his all when he sits on that stool--and I for one hope it continues for a long,long time. Keith Jarrett is a genuis, make no mistake about that. He could stand on his head for all I care, so long as he plays the way he does--that's all that matters.",1271203200,,742,4.384057971014493
7847146,5,630344654X,"This is the first Keith Jarrett Trio DVD I bought .

The whole presentation is first rate and I would recommend it to any jazz fan .

Keith does not speak to the audience , but lets the piano do the talking . Double bassist Gary and drummer Jack are with him every step of the way .

The way the concert is filmed keeps the pace going and always changes angles at the right speed .

An essential purchase for fans of piano trio jazz .",1126051200,2,434,3.954022988505747
7847147,4,630344654X,"The musicianship and the quality of the filming and audio recording are simply outstanding, and it seems there is general agreement on this.  The controversy concerns Mr. Jarrett's vocalizations.  Here's my 2 cents:
I've been a Jarrett fan since the early 70's, own most of his recordings, and have seen him live both solo and with the trio numerous times, so I am very familiar with his vocalizations.  I break them into two categories - hoops/hollers/moans/groans and ""singing"" along with the melody he is playing.
The hoops/hollers/moans/groans don't bother me at all...it simply shows how into the music he is, and for me it doesn't detract from the music.  The ""singing"", as others have stated, you can learn to ignore.  And frankly, in most of the recordings that I am familiar with, Mr. Jarrett's vocalizations are low enough in the mix to allow one to ignore them.
However, I must admit that with this DVD, the vocalizations are exceptionally loud (perhaps because of the excellent recording quality), grossly off and out of tune (more so than on any other recording that I own), and frankly on some pieces incredibly, and sadly, distracting.
Should you buy it?  Folks, there are moments of sheer brilliance on this recording, and for the music sans vocalizations, this is a 5 star recording.  I have played the DVD constantly since purchasing it, as I just love these guys.  But in my view, the vocalizations are much more pronounced and annoying on this DVD that on the other Jarrett DVDs.  Thus, I rate this DVD 4 stars.",1043971200,9,1531,4.835249042145594
7847148,5,630344654X,"I really wish all jazz DVDs were like this. No gimmicks, no useless documentary, just amazing jazz from possibly the most acclaimed trio still playing today. The sound quality is impeccable, allowing you to really appreciate Jarrett's poignant lyricism. Out of all the live jazz I've seen, only Jarrett has moved me to tears with the pure beauty of his playing. This DVD is a great capture of a great live performance.
Jarrett and his Trio are acclaimed for bringing standards back to the modern jazz limelight. The decades-old chemistry between Jarrett, Peacock, and DeJohnette is obvious from their remarkable interaction in this concert.
Although I've never heard Jarrett play a bad set, this one exceeds my expectations. I've always been partial to the trio's ""Bye Bye Blackbird"", but other tracks like ""Oleo"" and ""Solar"" are among the true gems on this DVD.
The performance is wonderfully warm and live, with shots lingering just long enough to let you take it all in without engaging in the hyperactive camera work plaguing some music DVDs today. It's entertaining to see Jarrett lose his time in the first solo chorus of ""Oleo"", as former Miles-sideman DeJohnette throws him off with all sorts of off-beat explorations. Many complain about Jarrett's signature groans and horribly out-of-tune whining, but any Jarrett fan quickly learns to naturally filter them out. If you really have a problem with that sort of thing, don't buy this DVD or you will be distracted and more than a little disgruntled. On the other hand, if you can bear it this DVD is one of the best jazz DVDs out there.",1030147200,23,1594,4.907407407407407
7847149,3,630344654X,"I would give this dvd 7 stars too, if it were not for one detail.  The coverage of the different musicians is great, the visual quality is great, the musicians are (of course) great, but what is the deal with the annoying high-pitched noises Keith Jarrett makes?!  I mean it's not even in tune with what he's playing!  Talk about ruining an otherwise perfect dvd.  It's really great jazz, and I attempted to look (or listen) past the ridiculous noises, but to no avail.  Pure torture.  Maybe I just don't have good concentration, but there is so much good jazz out there that I would never recommend this dvd.  I recommend buying something else and saving yourself the unnecessary hassle--unless you have extremely good concentration.",1028764800,10,734,4.824
7847150,5,630344654X,"In January of 1983, the month I was born, Keith Jarrett, Gary Peacock, and Jack DeJohnette stepped into a Manhattan studio to record two albums of ""standards."" For these three musicians, so associated with the Modern Creative and Free movements in jazz, it was a return to the most basic jazz material for them. Yet, they didn't put the normal jazz spin on this classic stuff, but added their own perspective to the mix. Almost 20 years later, here they are, still touring (though not as much as they used to) and still creating fresh music. This awesome concert from 1993 must still rank at the top of their concerts in terms of vitality, creative spark, energy, and interplay. I know Peacock/DeJohnette don't ""hate"" Jarrett's ""vocalizing,"" as a reviewer so tastelessly assumes below. If one hated playing with another, he wouldn't do it for nigh on 20 years. Other DVDs of this group can be found as Japanese imports, including ""Standards,"" ""Standards II,"" and the ""Tokyo Concert"" from 1996, most of which is memorialized on an ECM recording of the same name (DVD has the entire concert, however). This is probably the best of the DVDs by this group, but they are all worthy. This is, without a doubt, the best working band music has seen since 1983. No one can top them.",1026000000,,1273,4.713004484304933
