8494983,5,B0068TRUZ0,"If you can focus on the content of this DVD and ignore any objections you may have to its less than Hollywood-slick presentation, you may get a lot of benefit from it.
It was very helpful to watch Louis Velasquez demonstrate things, in addition to reading his book (Oil Painting Lessons with Rembrandt), as a picture really is worth a thousand words.
He provides a variety of non-toxic, make-it-yourself alternatives to commercial oil paints and solvents.
I loved the tips on painting with milk. How much more non-toxic can you get than milk? You must use non-fat milk (also known as skim milk), as the fat in regular milk never dries. Non-fat, or skim milk, dries to a lovely gloss. So the next time you paint in watercolor, try substituting skim milk for the water you would normally use, and see how you like the look of it. I love it and plan on doing many more paintings with it. I never would have thought of that myself. And that was just one of his minor ideas. There are lots of options.  Wait till you see what he has for painting with oil!
I highly recommend this DVD.",1472688000,,1079,4.44949494949495
8494984,3,B0068TRUZ0,"Interesting ideas on a milk-based medium, and worth a try. I would like to have seen finished works in light - how does this medium handle light through glazes? Is the final color chalky? Can you use the milk gel with straight pigment, or must an oil componant be added? Lots to consider, but here's why the three stars: through the first half of the video, insistant, maddeningly repetitive accordian music playing the same phrase over and over. Cannot turn it down without losing voiceover. Also, the text sections fly by much too quickly.",1437436800,,541,4.76595744680851
