8015955,2,B0001P1BKC,"Was looking for more information on Autism.  I ordered this and two others, 'Through the Eyes of Autism"" and ""Autism the Musical"".  Be careful for what type of machine that you can only play it on.  Some of these I was unable to play because it was some foreign machine that I needed.  One of these had verbal language that I totally didn't appreciate.  I got rid of all three DVD's and would never recommend or purchase again.",1450483200,,427,4.423076923076923
