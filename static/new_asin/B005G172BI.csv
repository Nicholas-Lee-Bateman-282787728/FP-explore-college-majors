4686833,5,B005G172BI,Once again the brits do comedy so well.  Aagin it was great to see something different over the holidays.  This will be a holiday classic in our household.,1358640000,,155,4.5
4686834,4,B005G172BI,It was great to see Christmas episodes from my favorite British comedies!  I was only familiar with four of the eight shows on these DVD's but the others were enjoyable all the same.,1357257600,,182,4.515151515151516
4686835,4,B005G172BI,"I bought this set to play at a Christmas party for all of my British TV loving friends.  I love all of the shows, but especially To The Manor Born and The Vicar of Dibley...one of the best Christmas plays ever filmed!

Of extra notice as a special plus is the Black Adder Christmas special...absolutely rolling on the floor funny.  Black Adder is one of the best funnies to ever come out of England, save for maybe Mr Bean.

Its great to have this set of nothing but the Christmas episodes and it got me in the mood as I watched them all one after the other while wrapping presents and addressing cards.  I'm sure it will be a hit at the party.

Recommended for all those who love BBC comedy and want to get into the Christmas spirit.",1355270400,4,734,4.244604316546763
4686836,4,B005G172BI,"This BBC production is great but, if you really really like British Christmas comedy you might want to look at the BBC Holiday Gift set over this set - while the currently being reviewed set is a bit cheaper the BBC Holiday Gift set gives you everything in the BBC Holiday Comedy set plus some additional episodes.

If you are pure comedy only then the BBC Holiday Comedy set is the better selection but, if you also like British shows such as Lovejoy then you might prefer the BBC Holiday Gift set.",1355270400,16,499,4.423913043478261
4686837,5,B005G172BI,It's hard to beat British humor.  These are some of the best Christmas British humor you can get.  Dawn French is just greast as is Rowan Adkinson.  You will watch these more than once.,1339200000,4,185,4.382352941176471
4686838,4,B005G172BI,"I have not viewed this DVD. I bought it for a friend who expressed an interest in this DVD. I plan to give this prior to the holidays, so she can enjoy it. In reviewing the programs on this DVD, I noticed that I have seen many of these and have a few on VHS/DVD. For anyone who likes the older english holiday shows, this would be a good choice. I also know that there is at least 1 other holiday DVD that has these shows and a few others. I made my choice based upon the wishes of the recipient. You may not like this DVD, however, if you or someone you know like the older english holiday specials, then you can not go wrong with this DVD. Enjoy.",1334707200,2,648,3.9923076923076923
4686839,5,B005G172BI,We wacthed this video near Christmas. My family Laughed so much every time we looked at each other we started to laugh again. This video is worth the money. If you like Bristh Comedy you'll love this one.,1327276800,2,204,4.394736842105263
4686840,3,B005G172BI,Dull humor for the holidays. It's obvious the English have a different form of celebrating Christmas than the U.S. does.,1325116800,,120,5.05
4686841,5,B005G172BI,"Excellent comedy series' from BBC. This set gives those who do not own the series collections to investigate the humor of the Brits through just Christmas episodes. It's a delightful way to pick your favorite and then move on to more of the series. Many of the series ran for several years. Most had multiple holiday episodes. This is a sampler, and one you will enjoy.

For an even better deal, look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BBC-Holiday-Gift-Set/dp/B005G172Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BBC Holiday Gift Set</a>&nbsp;which not only gives you all that is on this comedy set, but also 6 episodes of some of the best drama productions ever produced on British television, including my favorites of Lark Rise to Candleford, Monarch of the Glen, and To the Manor Born. Also available is BBC Holiday Drama, the second set that matches this comedy set--but remember, you get both in one set with BBC Holiday Gift Set.

You can't go wrong with any of the 3. Great gifts any time of year. A DVD anthology of British TV delight. All you need then is a cuppa tea and scones. Ta!",1323129600,18,1121,5.153846153846154

4686862,2,B005G172BI,"For a American aficionado of British comedy & drama, I expected something much, much better.  I already had two (the ""To the Manor Born""  and ""Are You Being Served"" series).  Didn't get a laugh to speak of out of the rest.  If I don't find a Brit to give it to, someone who appreciates this stuff, it will be a big waste.",1419465600,,321,4.129032258064516

4686866,3,B005G172BI,"OK entertainment for filling a bit of time during the holidays, but - obviously - somewhat dated. Mrs. ""Bouquet/ Bucket"" of course is still the best!",1389398400,2,149,4.769230769230769
4686867,4,B005G172BI,If you are a fan of BBC Comedy (as I am) this should be in your collection.  All the Holiday favorites are here.  A great collection.  I'm not certain why though a non-holiday episode of Allo - Allo  takes up so much time.,1388448000,2,222,4.093023255813954

8470912,5,B005G172BI,I have been through a lot lately and needed some cheering up. Since I love Christmas shows and British comedies I figured I would give it a try. Well it's not getting put away whenever I am blue I pop it in.  As with anything else there are some shows I enjoy more than others. Be aware that these are all suppose to be Christmas shows and Allo Allo has nothing to do with Christmas. However I enjoyed it very much and you can't beat the price. I know it will give you a laugh.
