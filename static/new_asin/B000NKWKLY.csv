8179112,5,B000NKWKLY,"The Golden Rendezvous by Alistair MacLean Has almost as many stars as ""Around The World in 80 Days"" [Not nearly ]  OK the stars are from the 70's but they are the keepers. But the story runs without reveling the punch line till the last. The movie has the twists and turns that the book had, so if you read the book you will still enjoy the movie. Action Adventure is this movie, running around inside and out side a ship at sea [of course in a storm]. Lies, betreails Murder and subtrafuse enough to sink the ship. Gun play, knife fights, oh very pretty women. So what are you waiting for?",1369958400,,590,4.267857142857143

8179114,4,B000NKWKLY,"I remember watching this on British television in the 1980s and enjoying it back then so I ordered a copy of the VHS as I started backing-up other VHS titles I had on the more durable DVD format.
I was not disappointed. Over the years I had read a number of negative reviews of this movie and had begun to wonder if my fond memories of sitting around the television watching this movie was more a case of nostagia than reality and if I had confused it with another Richard Harris cruise liner actioner named ""Juggernaut"" (itself a decent action movie). Based on an Alistair MacLean book of the same name this movie stars Harris as a crewmember on a luxury liner, the incredibly beautiful Ann Turkel as a passenger and the sneering, sinister John Vernon as a villain. A group of heavily armed mercenaries plan to intercept a U.S. Treasury gold bullion ship using a distress call from the liner as a ruse (the ""Golden Rendezvous"" of the title), steal the gold and then cover their tracks as well as killing off any witnesses with an enormous explosion.
Harris proves to be a decent enough action man as he tries to outwit the thieves and save the day and the always watchable John Vernon plays to type, as the kind of villain he made a career out of playing in the 1970s. The quality on this VHS is somewhat surprisingly acceptable and I have no problem recommending this movie.
On a sidenote, movies from the same era that are similar to this are the aforementioned ""Juggernaut"" and ""Ffolkes"" (""North Sea Hijack"" overseas). It should also be noted that Amazon has a double listing for this movie also under the title ""Golden.""",1192752000,13,1625,4.568493150684931
