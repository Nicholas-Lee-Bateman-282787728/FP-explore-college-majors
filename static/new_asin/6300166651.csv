211562,4,6300166651,"It's hard to believe this film was made in 1980 - that's after the exorcist, after texas chainsaw massacre, after many of the gory italian horrors - yet here the monster club is made in the authentic style of the amicus horror films of the 60's.
it's no surprise it wasn't a big success.
but looking back now, it's great fun - and a great tribute to those films.
there are problems, the monsters in the club itself look awful.
in an interview vincent price revealed that they were actually made for a pittance by a milkman - really!
the songs date it also, yet at the same time provide part of the charm.
as ever the main attraction is the stories themselves. surprisingly only one story (the ghostly village) is from the original book of the monster club. all the others are either totally different, or altered a fair bit - i've no idea why they didn't adapt the stories from the book - such as the story of the boy who becomes a werewolf without knowing it, and falls in love with a vampire girl - without knowing that either.
having said that the stories here are still very good.
so it's reccomended for fans of similar films - just don't expect a bloodbath!",1066348800,3,1163,4.388888888888889
211563,5,6300166651,"Any fan of campy horror flicks will love this series of vignettes told by an aging vamp (Vincent Price) to a curious writer--his guest--at the local ""Monster Club"". frequented by the town vamps, werewolves, ghouls, etc. The vignettes range from scary to funny to rather sad, but they all make for a most entertaimning video!",1060646400,2,324,4.909090909090909
211564,4,6300166651,"first off, i give this movie four stars because of the unnecessary musical interruptions. there's an '80s rock group; a disturbing performance from a blue vampire-type who looks like a cross between Jay Leno and Gene Simmons singing ""I'm Just a Sucker for Your Love""; and a Janis Joplin freak who looks like Marilu Henner. aside from this, i loved the movie as i suspected i would before viewing it. Vincent plays a dracula named Eramus and John Carradine plays a reporter. the two have lunch at The Monster Club where Eramus talks of monster geneology and tells three tales: the first involves a shadmock, a cross bewteen two sets of monsters: a ""shaddie"" and a ""maddie"", and the result is a ""mock"" which is polite for ""mongrel"", Eramus gleefully tells us. we hear the lineage of monsters and how tormented a shadmock is. he uses a deadly whistle to kil his victims. in the story, a gold-digger and her yuppie boyfriend plan to ruin the eccentric millionaire but have no clue that when annoyed, the millionaire ""shadmock"" lets loose with a killer whistle. the shadmock looks similar to Lon Chany's appearance on Phantom of the Opera. in the second story, we're told about a vampire and his wife and son who are being chased by an organization known as ""The Bleeny"", who travel with violin cases. you can guess what's really in the cases. the story has a twist ending that plays against the stereotypical 'bad guy' vampire image. in the third story, we're told about a foggy village known as Loughville that a horror movie director stumbles to. it's a surreal world where the dead roam and feed off the living. a zombie story in other words. this director meets a ""humgoo"", a cross between a human and a ghoul. the director and the humgoo escape the foggy fortress of a town but upon arriving in the ""real world"", the girl can't live since she's been dead for years...Loughville is very loyal to it's inhabitants and visitors and when the director flags down the police to go get help, well, things aren't that simple...i won't give the twist ending to this story away. when the three stories are over, Eramus gives the club a morale to live up to by explaining that the ""real"" monsters are humans...we're the ones with guns, airships, murder, the death penalty, the power to use chemicals to wipe out masses of people, we have humans that decapitate, strangulate, etc. he makes a strong case against us humans for our monsterly deeds before hitting the dance floor with John Carradine. John dances with a monster while Vincent dances with a fat woman, much to his delight. this film was only shown in the U.K. when it arrived in 1980, it was Vincent's first horror movie since 1974's ""Madhouse"" it arrived in the United States in 1985 as a video movie under the banner ""ThrillerVideo"", hosted by Elvira-Mistress of the Dark. i don't think it was ever shown in theatres in the U.S.? anyway, this was Vincent at his best and aside from 1983's ""House of the Long Shadows"", this ""Monster Club"" would be one of his last major film roles as he would spend the rest of his career in minor, cameo roles usually playing a narrator of horror videos, a guest star on TV shows spoofing his image, or play two or three short scenes in contemporary horror films like ""Dead Heat"", ""The Offspring"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", or the mafia thriller ""Backtrack"". he continued to host ""Mystery!"" and appear on hilarious TV commercials but ""The Monster Club"" and the 1983 film were his last starring roles. buy ""The Monster Club"", it's a cute little film that all Price fans should seek out.",1045958400,,3568,4.68312101910828
211565,5,6300166651,"Curious horror anthology is loosely based on the works of horror novelist R. Chetwynd-Hayes, portrayed by John Carradine as an active partaker in his own tales. The author is invited by a smooth vampire (the fabulous Vincent Price) to go with him to The Monster Club, where he bears witness to the secret social customs of various monsters, which evidently include drinking, dancing, and watching undead stripping Go Go Ghouls. He is also educated to the mating patterns of these creatures, whose tendency to inter-breed creates such new strains of monsters.  All of this is interjected by short stories featuring campy yet fun monsters running amok.  A fun side note is that the movie features music by pop-reggae band UB40.  Have no sense of humor?  Avoid this film.  Love campy fun?  Don't miss out.",1042156800,12,802,4.947761194029851

I know people that don't like it because it makes the monsters human and isn't scarey.
THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE!!!!
What is so hard to understand about this?  It is meant to be a spoof movie, it's not meant to be serious.

Also, the monsters aren't classic (like Dracula is just chatting away) instead of everyone being more scary they're just like humans themselves, only worse...  You don't even have to look at this review to know what it's like.  Nude people, more than human-like monsters, and the plot and action make this movie the lone star of the losers of the world of horror videos.

211606,4,6300166651,"""The Monster Club"" is the last of the portmanteau horror films produced by Milton Subotsky -- half of the Amicus Films team -- and for decades it's been thought to be the least, a pale shadow of the likes of ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"" or ""Tales From the Crypt.""  But time has been oddly good to this little picture. Vincent Price stars as a vampire who invites John Carradine, playing real-life author R. Chetwind-Hayes, on whose stories the film is based, to a discotheque for monsters only, and then relates three tales of terror, two serious, one tongue-in-cheek.  They're all pretty good, though the scenes in the club can sometimes be a bit much.  Still, Price's explanation of the in-breeding of monster hybrids, which came off as high camp at the time, now seems to have paved the way for today's ""The Vampire Diaries.""  The supporting cast, including Simon Ward, Richard Johnson, Stuart Whitman and Donald Pleasence, is fine, and Whitman's story, involving a secluded village of monsters, is atmospheric. But Price is basically the whole show.  By 1980 he had largely forsworn horror films, particularly campy horror films, but here he is in fine form and his unique voice, conditioned by his return to the stage for a one-man show on Oscar Wilde, is at its most rich and resonant. His climactic explanation as to why humans are the ultimate monsters is a tour de force. For his part, John Carradine seems a little puzzled by the proceedings at times, but he's done worse.  (A lot worse.)  All in all, this is worth a look, and maybe a return visit as well.",1447804800,4,1570,4.708029197080292
211607,4,6300166651,"I adore Vincent Price but hadn't heard of this movie until I came across a clip of it on YouTube with Vincent Price singing a rendition of The Monster Mash.
I immediately ordered the movie. It is beautifully restored and was wonderful seeing Vincent along with John Carradine and Donald Pleasence. The movie is an enjoyable watch; my only reason for giving it 4 stars is because I was let down. After waiting anxiously for the end of the movie, Vincent Price didn't do the Monster Mash, it was another song completely.

211613,5,6300166651,"This is a rating coming from a horror fan who can safely say i hate anthologies.

 I actually found myself enjoying this movie very much.  I felt that the genealogy tie-in to each story gave it a good base to bring each story together nicely and the quirky nightclub was very fun and helped move through the different tales very well.

 Of course getting to see Vincent Price have fun with his role was a blast and worth owning this film alone for any Vincent Price fan.  The bonus features are very welcome indeed and make this movie a true gem to own.",1394841600,2,553,4.320388349514563

211645,3,6300166651,"This is considered Amicus Studios last film although the studio had dissolved a couple years before. Nonetheless it sure looks like something Amicus would produce. Vincent Price plays a vampire who takes a bite out of a famous writer (John Carridine) then, out of gratitude for the blood, takes him to a swinging disco populated by all sorts of ghouls. While there Price relates three tales of terror, each based on the writings of R. Chetwynd-Hayes.

The tone of this movie is all over the place. Obstinately, it`s a comedy especially during the wraparound disco scenes. But the three stories are either serious - the first and the third - or downright looney - the second. The most unique thing about each segment is that the monsters always win.

The disco scenes are also punctuated with song buy Pretty Things, B.A. Robertson, UB40. This is usually a good time to grab a bite to eat or whatever. The highlight is probably the strip scene where a sexy dancer takes it all off.

The third story with Stuart Whitman is the closest to having some actual tension and therefore is the best episode.

A fun movie despite its flaws.

The presentation on Scorpion`s BluRay is simply a revelation. The picture quality is outstanding as is the sound. The movie has probably never looked this good before.
Extras are plentiful: There are two interviews with Vincent Price recorded way back when by David Del Vallle. A trailer and an intro by Katrina, who is a very pleasant hostess. Although I chose not to watch the movie in Nightmare Theatre mode.

This is a no-brainer for Vincent Price fans.",1388361600,2,1588,4.7355072463768115

211649,4,6300166651,"I saw this film theatrically when it came out.  At the time, it was already an oddity--the last Amicus film that was not released under the Amicus logo.

The film itself is campy fun with Vincent Price and John Carradine hamming it up in rather well-done musical interludes between the three stories that make up the film.  The stories themselves are not bad and solidly made with just a hint of horror--enough to whet the appetite of the horror connoisseur.

The music in the interludes is really good--especially the 'Stripper' song and visual--great fun and well made.

The disk is nice and clear with good color and wonderful sound.  A nice addition to any horror collection",1384905600,3,678,4.801724137931035

211651,5,6300166651,"The Monster Club is one of those obscure gems sought out by fans in the Vincent Price filmography and usually placed alongside The House of Long Shadows (which also needs an official non-archive release!) as a must see addition to Price's later catalog. The first DVD release of The Monster Club from Pathfinder a few years ago was mastered from a murky print of the film and special features included the trailer, complete soundtrack and an easter egg interview with an extra on the film, Sean Barry Weske. This blu-ray release from relatively unknown ""Scorpion Films"" is a fantastic upgrade to the DVD and contains 169 anamorphic HD mastered pristine video and audio and quite a few extras. The film can be viewed normally, or with included Elvira inspired cutscenes of Katarina's Nightmare Theater which is rather annoying to sit through. Extras this time include interviews lifted from the Vincent Price Sinister Image DVD, including the on camera and off camera audio, both conducted by David Del Valle. However, keep your Sinister Image disc because none of the other features have been ported over. Alongside the trailer, Scorpion has also included a current interview with David Del Valle about his career and interaction with Price. This interview is cut with reaction shots from Katrina which are distracting and feel off, much like the feature length in Nightmare Theater mode.

Price plays an elderly vampire who attacks Carradine, a best-selling author of horror stories, realizing too late that he's bitten someone he admires.

Here he introduces Carradine to the reality behind the fiction he's been writing.

The movie, being set in a pub, also features some rock-n-roll singing, with titles like ""I'm Just a Sucker for Your Love,"" ""Monsters Rule OK,"" and ""Welcome to the Monster Club.""

211692,4,6300166651,"""The Monster Club"" is a unique mixture of humor, horror and groovy tunes from the late seventies.  It is the perfect film to watch on Halloween if one is nostalgic for the late seventies and early eighties.  The cast is a virtual who's who of horror stars such as Vincent Price (""Theatre of Blood""), John Carradine (""The Howling""), Donald Pleasance (""Halloween""), Stuart Whitman (""Eaten Alive"") and Britt Ekland (""The Whicker Man"").  ""The Monster Club"" is produced by Milton Subotsky; he co-founded the famous Amicus Productions, which created several horror anthologies such as ""Tales from the Crypt,"" ""Asylum"" and ""Torture Garden.""

  The vampire Erasmus (Price) bites horror writer R. Chetwynd Hayes (Carradine).  Because his blood was tasty, Erasmus shows his gratitude by taking Hayes to the Monster Club, a cabaret where creatures of the dark meet to dance and watch entertainers sing, strip and tell jokes.  It's a riotous Halloween party that never ends.  This part of the film is silly but fun; it sets the groundwork for a trio of horror stories.

  ""Shadmock"" is a ghoulish variation of ""Beauty and the Beast.""  A beautiful thief is employed by a strange, unattractive recluse.  He falls in love  with her.  However, when he catches her stealing, there are ear-splitting, fiery consequences.

  ""Vampire"" is a silly story where Pleasance is a vampire hunter pretending to be a priest; him and his fellow hunters terrorize a loving family whose mother is the beautiful Ekland.

  ""Humgoo"" stars Whitman as a movie director in search of the perfect location to film a horror movie.  Unfortunately, he finds Loughville, a creepy, sinister village which is populated by flesh eating ghouls.  Will he escape before they eat him?  It has a great twist ending that will shock you.

  Erasmus proposes that Hayes become a member of the Monster Club.  After all, humans, he explains, kill each other in many horrible ways.  It's a message that will remain with the viewer.  ""The Monster Club"" is not for everyone.  Personally, I don't like a lot of humor mixed in with my horror.  However, this film is worth watching for the ""Shadmock"" and ""Humgoo"" stories and the soundtrack is great.  The DVD is loaded with plenty of extra features; the one containing the complete soundtrack is especially nice.  ""The Monster Club"" is highly recommend for horror anthology completists.

211725,4,6300166651,"I'm not going to review the film, since others have done an excellent job of that already.  I will say that it is a classic horror comedy well worth watching.  The main reason for this short review is to point out that the stand alone soundtrack included on the DVD, in a jukebox format where you can click on the song and listen to it, is flawed.  The problem concerns the original LP used by Pathfinder Entertainment to record the tunes.  All of the instrumentals, four tracks worth from the B side of the record, are full of pops and crackles.  Now, wouldn't you have thought that the folks converting these tunes would take the time to clean them up?  Took me forever to do it myself for a separate MP3 soundtrack.  Seems they didn't bother to even listen to them after recording, otherwise a good sound editor would have taken the time to clear away the noise.  Anyway, I just wanted to warn anyone purchasing this DVD for the soundtrack that the instrumentals have problems.  Other than that, the DVD is excellent.",1210291200,4,1020,4.530054644808743

211728,3,6300166651,I was very pleased with the picture quality of my movie. I was a little disappointed with the packaging though. When I recieved and then opened my dvd movie I found that the case was broken and the dvd itself was rolling around loose. The dvd seemed to have several sctratches because of this but thankfully upon veiwing the movie it did not seem to be affected. I am now a little wary about purschasing another movie simply because I do not like having to return items. Hopefully this will not happen again.,1194566400,,508,4.473118279569892

I got this film because i am a Vincent Price fan, even though, this isn't one of his best films, you barely will ever see this film on TV and its great for that Halloween viewing when there is nothing on TV.

211730,5,6300166651,"Being a huge fan of Elvira, I originally bought the VHS of THE MONSTER CLUB in the 80s when she hosted the film on her ""ThrillerVideo"" collection.  I remeber seeing for the first time and loving all three stories in the trilogy, the great performances by Price and Carradine, the atmosphere and monster ""Make-up"" (i.e. cheap rubber masks) and even the over-the-top musical numbers (especially ""The Stripper,"" complete with a woman stripping down to her skeleton in animation).  Since then I've watched the film every halloween.

  I was thrilled to see the film was finally on DVD.  The film is in widescreen with a pretty decent transfer--but what MOST inpressed me was the Special Features.  The gallery (featuring posters, adslicks, lobby cards, etc.) PLUS the FULL SOUNDTRACK of TMC (score AND songs), plus an Easter Egg featuring an interview with the ""Slingshot Ghoul"" in the Humgoo story.

The DVD is a treat and highly recommended.",1126483200,8,939,5.012903225806451

The Shadmock tale is great since the dude has no makeup(the effects were done by a milk man) and he was ment to be scary. I love how Price kept a straight face when explaining the monster hierarchy.",1097366400,2,348,4.5396825396825395
211732,5,6300166651,"Ah, ""The Monster Club"".  This crazy little masterpiece is one of my all-time favorite movies.  A sort of combination horror anthology/variety show, we're treated to three unusual short stories (all of them good, but very different in tone from one another), each one sandwiched between a musical number by a long-forgotten, early Eighties British New Wave band.

When a gentlemanly vampire by the name of Eramus (the one and only Vincent Price) doesn't realize that the man he just attacked was in fact his favorite writer (John Carradine), he attempts to amend the situation by bringing him as his special guest to a nightclub where no humans -- only monsters -- are allowed.  During the course of his evening there, Carradine is told a trio of frightening tales, and this (together with the music and dancing) provides the basic idea behind the film (I have no idea how closely this movie resembles the book on which it was apparently based).  Of the stories, I liked the third one best, for all its great atmosphere (a dreary village where everything is blue and gray and shrouded in never-lifting fog), unsettling thoughts and occurrences (I shudder every time the girl says the words, ""good eating""), and fantastic artwork (the black-and-white still images we see as we learn the village's back-story, which are just gorgeous).  Nevertheless, the first two stories are enjoyable too ... while the first is so sad and sweet and stylishly put together, the lighthearted second (which stars Donald Pleasance, for fans of ""Halloween"") makes an attempt at a more humorous storytelling style.

But what really makes me smile with ""TMC"" are the linking pieces of narration, set in the nightclub ... in an anthology film such as this, the framework tends more often, I've found to be the weakest part fo the movie ... but not here.  WE're treated with some great music (my favorite has to be vampire singer B.A. Robertson's ""I'm Just a Sucker for Your Love"", mainly for the song's goofy bounce, terrible pun-filled lyrics, the wacky way the camera the single camera used to film the performance moves while Mr. Robertson does his thing), and the overall enthusiastic silliness of the whole sequence.  But I really should say that I enjoyed all four of the songs we get to hear, and that I often put the disc in just to view the performances and enjoy the music.

But really, Price is the true star of the movie, clearly enjoying every second he's allowed to spend before the camera.  From his first meeting with Carradine to his explanation of monster genealogy to his lecture on why humans are truly the greatest monsters of all,, Price really makes TMC his own from start to finish and is definitely the best thing about the whole film.  If there's any reason to see this movie at all, it's to watch the man at work.  Price is (was) one of my very favorite actors, and in this film he certainly doesn't disappoint.  Plus, we get to see him boogie down with a monster on the dance floor as the final musical number plays ... and who could refuse a chance to see that?

The folks at Pathfinder have released TMC in an edition that  include a number of special features (mostly in the form of highly interesting reading material), the complete soundtrack of the film (for my money the best special feature of all, as these are the original soundtrack album versions, and not the live ones we hear in the movie), and really quite a bit more.  There's an Easter Egg too, on the special features menu, if you can find it.  I must say that I would have loved to have heard director Roy Ward Baker on the commentary track, but the one included hear, by a pair of Generation X movie critics, is an entertaining listen even without him.

I will conclude by saying that with a goofy, fun and yet still-creepy horror film full of great music and memorable performances, together with enough bonus material to keep you busy for quite a while after the movie's over, ""The Monster Club"" is a movie you just shouldn't turn down if a copy manages to come your way.  So before October 31 rolls around grab a copy for yourself, and make it a double feature with 1970's ""The House that Dripped Blood"", a classic horror anthology from the golden age of the genre.  Then turn out the lights, pop some popcorn, and get ready to have some fun.

The only slight glich is the commentary from Beavis and Butthead (the actual people who released the dvd) who try there best to slag the film off in the most horror film nerd cliches of all time.

211734,4,6300166651,"Back in the mid 60's to early 70's, Amicus Productions (The Studio That Dripped Blood) rivaled the famous Hammer Studios and its' horror films, and the releases from the two English studios were often confused as they often used many of the same actors and directors.  Amicus Productions was most famous for its' creepy horror anthologies, including The House that Dripped Blood (1970), Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1974), and From Beyond the Grave (1975).  Amicus, formed by a partnership between producers Milton Subotsky and Max J. Rosenberg, dissolved in the mid 70's, as did Amicus Productions.  While many fans mourned the passing of this wonderful and short-lived institution, Subotosky did go on to form Sword and Sorcery Productions, which released The Monster Club (1980), bringing back some of the magic of a time since past.
Directed by Roy Ward Baker, who also did Asylum and The Vault of Horror, along with numerous Hammer films, The Monster Club, based on a book by famed and prolific author R. Chetwynd-Hayes boasts a plethora of stars including Vincent Price, John Carradine, Donald Pleasance, Britt Ekland, Stuart Whitman, and Patrick Magee, among others.  There are three stories here, loosely tied together with a wrap-around story and a number of musical performances (B.A. Robertson is great performing 'Sucker for Your Love'), all wonderful in their own right.
The film starts off with the wrap-around story, as we meet a character named after the author of the book the film is based on, R. Chetwynd-Hayes (Carradine) being approached by a man looking for a bite, as he hasn't eaten in a couple of weeks.  Chetwynd-Hayes offers assistance in the form of money, but the man, named Eramus (Price) isn't speaking of eating in the normal sense, as he's a vampire and takes some of Chetwynd-Hayes blood, but not to the point where he infects the author.  Learning of the man's identity and feeling a debt of gratitude is due, Eramus offers to take Chetwynd-Hayes to a exclusive club, a sort of monster disco, where monsters reside, allowing for the author to gather new material for a future book.  After some tongue-in-cheek humor, we are treated to three tales of varying degrees of horror.
The first tale involves couple, George and Angela, of dubious nature looking for their next scheme, and it comes in the form of a position cataloging antiquities for a odd looking man named Raven who rarely leaves his large and expansive estate.  Angela applies, but soon balks as she has great apprehension about the man, given his strange appearance.  George talks her into going back, and she assumes the position.  He seems nice enough, despite his ghoulish appearance, and he certainly has a tempting amount of valuables ripe for the taking.  Raven soon becomes enamored with Angela and proposes marriage, to which George sees as a perfect opportunity to have access to Raven's wealth.  Well, things soon sour, and we learn Raven is much more than an odd-looking fellow, possessing an interesting method of dealing with those who anger him.
The second story deals with a shy, young boy and his parents, to which the father has a job that requires him to stay out all night, and sleep during the day.  Also, the boy learns that he's descended from noble lineage, his father being a count.  Can you guess where this is leading?  Anyway, not to give too much away, the story deals with vampires and vampires hunters, and actually is the more humorous, despite its' dour beginnings, of the three tales, providing a couple of nice twists at the end.  This story stars Britt Ekland and Donald Pleasance.
The third story tells a tale of a director named Sam (Whitman) scouting locations for a new horror film, looking for a village with lots and lots of atmosphere, which he finds, but soon regrets.  The village, populated by ghouls, has plans for Sam, and they don't involve making a movie.  Sam finds assistance in the form of a girl, and both take refuge in an abandoned church, where Sam learns the awful history of the village, and how it came to such a state that it's in now.  Do Sam and the girl manage an escape?  Maybe they do, maybe they don't...you'll just have to watch.  This tale has the strongest horror element, and a really wonderful, thick, brooding sense of atmosphere.  Reminds me a little of a film Vincent Price did back in the day called The Last Man on Earth (1964).
Pathfinder Home Entertainment provides a pretty good wide screen, non-anamorphic print here, which does show minor speckling and occasional murkiness, to which we learn that this was the only print available to them with a on-screen note prior to the beginning of the film.  As far as special features go, there are a ton of them.  There's a complete musical soundtrack, with the ability to listen to any song from the movie, and there's a lot, with artists like The Pretty Things, UB40, B.A. Robertson, and The Viewers, to name a few.  There's also a separate commentary by film critics Luke Y. Thompson and Gregory Weinkauf, a theatrical trailer for the film, detailed biographies of most of the films stars, extensive production notes, original press notes, a photo still gallery, essays by film critic George Reis and, a bit by Vincent Price and his views on horror movies in general, and even a hidden feature accessed by clicking on the doctor's stomach in the special features menu.  All in all, this is a great little horror anthology infused with a good dose of silly humor, one that fans of the long gone but not forgotten Amicus films will enjoy.  But be warned, as the real horror doesn't come until the end, when Vincent Price and John Carradine proceed to get 'jiggy' with it on the dance floor.
