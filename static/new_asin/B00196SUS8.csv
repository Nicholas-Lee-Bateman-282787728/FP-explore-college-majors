3423686,5,B00196SUS8,"There are some of the very best of ""golden oldies"" tv shows on these DVDs. They are mostly from the 50's.  These old tv shows are still funny and great entertainment for the entire family. The commercials can be as entertaining as the shows.",1230336000,,241,4.4772727272727275
3423687,4,B00196SUS8,"With the absolute garbage on television today these DVD sets are a godsend.  You get one-hundred and fifty old television shows, at least 70 hours of quality entertainment!  And here's what they don't tell you in any of the ads--many of these shows run the full half hour complete with all those woderful old commercials!  See the brand new 57 Chevy or the top of the line Brownie camera.  Or how about Efrem plugging the next episode of the FBI this Sunday night.  Great, great stuff.  There are other Mill Creek boxed sets of old television shows, and there worth every penny!",1217635200,8,578,4.617647058823529

Besides the more commonly seen programs, there's samples here of some genuine TV rarities, like the Buster Keaton, Jim Backus, Dennis Day and Dennis O'Keefe shows. Video and audio transfer quality of these antique TV films is generally good.

The discs are housed in a space-saving easy-access storage box (front hinged door with two velcro closures).

8272136,3,B00196SUS8,Don't get me wrong there are some great old shows on the discs but I gave it 3 stars because almost a third of the programs are The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and The Lucy Show. I think it would have gotten a higher rating from me if there had been 4 or 5 of each and more variety of shows.,1425340800,,295,3.774193548387097

8272140,5,B00196SUS8,"Bought this for my husband who does not enjoy the tv shows produced today. He, our daughter of 15, and myself love and enjoy watching these classic shows of yesteryear. I would recommend to everyone.",1369958400,2,199,4.714285714285714

8272142,4,B00196SUS8,"I love the series in this collection. The sound for some shows is good, but for others it's so bad we couldn't watch them.",1351555200,,122,4.125
8272143,5,B00196SUS8,"This 12 disc set of vintage television shows of the 1950's and 1960's will be treasured by any fan of TV from the era.  Although THE LUCY SHOW (20 episodes), OZZIE AND HARRIET (20 episodes) and THE JACK BENNY SHOW (10 episodes) are perhaps too overrepresented  in the set, there's still another 28 shows that have 1-7 episodes each here.

There's not much to add to the credits beyond Annie Van Auken's always essential comments on sets like these, however I would like to point out some of my favorite shows.  There's super rare EDGAR BERGEN variety show from 1950 with guest Diana Lynn with a Thanksgiving theme (and of course Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd), an episode from LIBERACE with a very rare chance to see the iconic vaudeville stars The Duncan Sisters (one of four Liberace episodes), and certainly the five episodes of the ED WYNN show from 1949-50 are worth buying the set for by themselves with such great guests as Hattie McDaniel, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, Virginia O'Brien, and Victor Moore. The 50's children's show SKY KING has four episodes and there are two episodes from the surprisingly hard-to-find Eve Arden classic OUR MISS BROOKS.  There's two episodes from the elusive BUSTER KEATON show of the 1950's snf five from MICKEY ROONEY's long-forgotten sitcom.  Ann Sothern's hit PRIVATE SECRETARY is represented by three programs and everyone's favorite collie LASSIE has two episodes from the early years.  Other rarities in the set include Wally Cox's THE ADVENTURES OF HIRAM HOLIDAY (six episodes), THE DENNIS O'KEEFE SHOW (four), THE JIM BACKUS SHOW (two), and Stu Erwin's THE TROUBLE WITH FATHER (six).  Joan Davis' well-remembered I MARRIED JOAN has six programs in the set as is the evergreen TV legend Betty White in her first sitcom LIFE WITH ELIZABETH.  Cult favorites MISTER ED, HOWDY DOODY, and SEA HUNT are represented with an episode a piece. Most of the programs are half-hour shows.

I should add Mill Creek has changed the cover of the set from initial release; the original pictured Danny Thomas, Dick Van Dyke, Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam, Mister Ed and Alan Young.  The current edition pictures Van Dyke along with Mary Tyler Moore and Robbie.  I have no idea if they have changed the lineup any but it's likely minor if any.  The set I have is in line with the episodes mentioned by Amazon's listing and Annie Van Auken's review.

Mill Creek has done many of these ""public domain"" box sets on various movies, I'd love to see them do a sequel to this set with even more rarities from the 50's and 60's.  Picture quality is usually very good considering how old many of these shows are and how several of the early ones are from kineoscopes rather than film prints.",1283299200,8,2722,4.7987152034261245
8272144,5,B00196SUS8,"If you grew up in the 1950's and early 1960's, or wish that you had, this collection offers some of the comedy gems from the era.  Ah, to return to those days when TV didn't make it a point to insult your morals, make violence as common as breathing, and simply wanted to entertain you.  Some of the shows are hokey, but they never imitate the stupid story lines of today's offerings (Thank God!)",1260662400,,396,4.337837837837838
