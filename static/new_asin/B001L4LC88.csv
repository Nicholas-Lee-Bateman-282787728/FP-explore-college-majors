3678411,5,B001L4LC88,"I have to say if it was not for my kids I probably would not have bought this movie but I am glad I did.  It takes a whole new look at Christmas and those kids who do not have parents or anything to hope for. It touches on a senstivie subject but does it in a light hearted way.  Yeah, for a moment you might shed a tear but in the end you are routing for them and the kids all the way.",1234310400,2,386,3.5833333333333335
3678412,5,B001L4LC88,"I agree with  both customer, who gave only one or two stars, that this movie isn't for very little children. But when you're older and love D & J, you'd understand the gags. And they are hilarious. And when you're really old, just like me, you even can understand some allusion, like the scene with Crazy Steve and the Delorean. My kids (11 and 13) loved the movie too, even if my son didn't understand so much, because we live in Germay and his english isn't that good yet.
The plot was good, the child actors were cute, the  film was really funny and you could feel the chemistry between Drake and Josh in every scene. They are a great team. I hope, this isn't the last movie they did together.",1230854400,5,696,4.305343511450381
3678413,1,B001L4LC88,"My seven year old son is a huge Drake and Josh fan and so am I.  We were both disappointed in this Christmas special. My son had been looking forward to the show  for weeks but even he questioned the story line and characterizations. For example why did Megan cut the Christmas inflatable and why in the world is she wondering around in an outfit straight from the Road Warrior carrying a butterfly knife. Megan is bratty during the weekly show, but somehow her pranks are not so mean and malicious, and usually have a reason or a story line behind them. I  felt bad for Josh after Megan cut the inflatable, because he had been working so hard on a Christmas display for their yard, and she ruined it with no  discernible emotion or care at all.

I did not find the scene with the monkey funny and instead found it disturbing. Why put animals in a negative light like that?  Small children watch this show and were probably scared by the monkey scene.(My son's entire first grade class watched it-interestingly the girls all loved it and the boys hated it).  Christmas is not about influencing children to fear animals.

In the words of my small son,""I like the show Drake and Josh but the Christmas special was not funny.""",1230422400,5,1223,4.502262443438914
3678414,5,B001L4LC88,I loved this movie and the show and Drake and Josh period they are the funniest team around and they are so on with eachother all the time. I do agree that the show was a bit out of reality but all christmas shows at least the good ones are always a bit out there I mean like Scrooge or Miracle on 34th street I mean c'mon it is a christmas show after all the time of miracles and make believe and fun. Yes there is the religous side but if you perfer then watch the ten commandments.  I Love this show as much as all the others and I thank god for them especially since I lost my mom this year and this show and Drake Bell is the only things that can make me laugh or smile.  Oh by the way the show is called Drake and Josh Miranda is not the main star so it should say starring Drake Bell and Josh Peck shame on amazon.,1229644800,11,821,3.8520710059171597
3678415,5,B001L4LC88,"This is one of the funniest Christmas specials I have seen in my entire life and that is saying a lot because I am five hundred years old. No but seriously it was pretty hilarious, Zigby is the best character ever and I was laughing constantly. Also its pretty sweet and heartwarming and all that stuff and the little girl is cute but REALLY it was just mostly funny. I give it eleven Christmas Trees out of five.",1229558400,2,413,4.3076923076923075

3678421,1,B001L4LC88,"Do NOT buy this movie on DVD. The picture isn't full size or centered at all. I have a 40"" tv and the picture is in the center of the screen. The movie was made in 2008, but doesn't excuse for the format of the DVD. The only way to make it better is to adjust the settings on my tv, and even that isn't much better.

I love this movie a lot, it's my favorite Christmas movie. I am extremely disappointed the picture turned out this way. If I would have known, I wouldn't have bought it. I already own this movie on iTunes, from now on I'll just play it on iTunes.

I have attached pictures of my 40"" tv and how it looks. First picture is how it came on default settings. Second is settings changed to ""cinema mode"" on my tv. Third is settings changed to ""zoom"" on my tv. Nothing can make it right.",1482624000,,797,4.0062893081761

3678456,1,B001L4LC88,"I am a huge fan of Drake and Josh, and I was so sad when I heard that this would be their last special, and I was hoping this film would have concluded the Drake and Josh franchise and left me happy.

Drake gets a job at the mall as santa clause, he then bumps into a little girl after being chased by a fat girl, Drake then makes a christmas promise with the little girl. Josh throws a party on top of the movie theater when a couple of guys crash the party. Josh calls the police, Josh is then arrested for no apparent reason. Drake attempts to break Josh out of jail, They both get put on house arrest. The judge then orders to the boys to make that little girl's christmas promise come true, along with her family, and that promise is to give her the best christmas she has ever had.

First of all, why on earth was Josh arrested?! Why would a big scary guy who Josh met in prison pose as santa? Why would any judge, in the court of law, force someone to give a little girl and her family a christmas promise? Why weren't their parents notified? Aren't they still minors? Why wasn't the little girl and her family aware of the situation Drake and Josh were in? Why did the little girl get upset when her brother and her found out the situation Drake and Josh were in? Were they not doing their job? How did bludge get out of prison and show up as santa?

Sorry, but I just found this film completely absurd. They tried to make a new Good Burger, but it didn't work. The acting was overdone too. I just feel like as Drake and Josh fans, they kinda let us down. The only film I liked was the Really big shrimp film.",1372723200,2,1617,4.110759493670886
3678457,3,B001L4LC88,"It's a Drake & Josh movie made after the show already ended and everyone (except for Josh) had moved on to other projects.  If anyone is expecting Oscar gold, lower that bar by alot.  It's cheesy and funny, just like the show, so why expect any more than that.

My problem isn't with the movie itself, but the disc and packaging.

A few years back, this movie was pretty hard to find at a reasonable price, so when I saw Amazon had it for cheap, I jumped on it because my daughter LOVES Drake.  But I missed one important detail and didn't see it until I received the movie and noticed something was amiss with it:

""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.

This product is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play only"" devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives.""

And with that, it only works on one of our DVD players in the entire house, so it's an inconvenience any time my daughter wants to watch it.

But then again, it's still cheaper than paying $50+ for a ""retail"" version, if you can find one.",1365552000,,1121,4.455882352941177

3678462,3,B001L4LC88,"This movie was SO much better when I saw it the first time in HD on Nickelodeon!  Feels like a REAL ripoff knowing this movie was originally shot and aired in HD and that the DVD transfer is SO soft and poor.  The DVD ""menu"" screen looked out of focus as did the intro shots and scenes.  The vaguely blurry out of focus aspects went away but the incredibly CRAPPY DVD transfer was on display for the entire rest of the movie.  ANY show that was shot and aired in HD could receive a GREAT DVD transfer that looks solid upconverted (think CSI, Supernatural, Fringe what have you) the grainy and poor quality transfer on this disc is unconscionable!

The movie itself is fairly original and has moments of almost tear jerking laughter!  Having an eight year old boy get beat up and urinated on by a monkey on Christmas morning may not sound like Christmas fare and that is exactly WHY it is original and funny.

Movie content is classic Drake N Josh but the quality of the DVD transfer almost ruined it for us!",1323475200,6,1007,4.381720430107527

It was a touching movie about a little girls ""Christmas promise"" that Drake promises to fulfill but theres a twist. When Drake tries to bust Josh out of jail they tell the judge about the promise they made. The judge agrees to not throw them in jail but if they don't fulfill the promise they will head straight back to jail. Things don't go too smoothly at first but in the end it turns out to be a great Christmas after all and a very ""cheesy"" one too...thanks to Crazy Steve and his woodchipper Sally.
