736172,5,6303935516,"Something to Sing About is lesser known than Cagney's other musical endeavors, but it is every bit as good. His ranges as both a comedian and a dancer are on display here.

Watch him dance across faux piano keys and you'll believe he's actually making them sing! His foot work is mesmerizing. It is especially gratifying to watch when you consider that Cagney always considered himself a ""song and dance man"" first and foremost. You'll agree when you watch this.",1207612800,6,462,4.775
736173,5,6303935516,"I have seen unrestored versions of this movie and the picture quality of this particular DVD is pretty good. While it's still not perfect, I think they did the best with what they had and for the money it's a bargain.
As for the movie, it's a trite storyline, but there's a great Cagney dance sequence in the beginning and all of his charisma is on full display throughout. True fans will enjoy seeing a rare look at his considerable comedic talent.",1183507200,5,449,4.487804878048781

It seems like they have recorded the original negatives without them being cleaned, not even VHS quality, it's best to buy them by themselves, there are much better quality copies. I've seen Blood on the Sun on VHS, then saw it in this set and was amazed at how much worse the quality was.

736175,1,6303935516,"I bought this movie because I like old musicals, especially from the 1930's. The beginning of the movie was real good, but soon the sound broke up to where most of the sound wasn't there. I tried to fast forward and then rewind the movie on the VCR and play it. I did this several times and the sound still was broken up. If you enjoy good musicals, don't get it from Madacy Entertainment. Look for it on DVD.",1128470400,5,409,4.189873417721519

736178,4,6303935516,"If you appreciate James Cagney for the quality and spunk of his dancing, this film is for you!
Sure, the plot is nothing to sing about, but this film is to be watched for Cagney alone.
He has several hilarious episodes  as he enters Hollywood as a small time bandleader from NY. He is measured,  analyzed and critiqued by a voice coach, hair dresser and tailor, and his  reactions to all the poking and prodding show him as one of the underrated  but awesome comedic actors. (Anyone who doesn't recognize Cagney as a great  comedic actor hasn't seen enough of his films.)
Another great scene is  when he does some great Vaudevillian slapstick facial pantomimes of  ""the take, the double take, and the double take with the  fade-away.""
Now the dancing! Cagney, who always billed himself as a  song and dance man, never danced enough in his movies. But this has four  great scenes of him him at his best -- a combination of down-to-earth  hoofing and ballet. He does one scene with Johnny Boyle and Harland Dixon,  the former who danced for George M. Cohan and helped Cag choreograph  dancing sequences for ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" Much of Cagney's  dancing style is taken from Boyle.
No one could say that Cagney is the  greatest dancer, but he injected a street attitude into his dancing along  with exquisite grace that made him incomparable.

736509,4,6303935516,"Cagney always considered himself a song & dance man, since that's how he got his start in show business. Unfortunately, Hollywood has always gone in for typecasting, even more during the ""golden era"" than today. He had very few opportunities to show off his background as a ""hoofer"" but this, happily, is one of them.  He has several great dancing scenes (which, the story goes, he rehearsed with Fred Astaire) and makes the most of them, in that unusual style he had. The plot's not bad either, as we see tough guy Cagney deal with various Hollywood types, and the revelation that he's become a star apparently has some basis in fact, since he found out ""Public Enemy"" was a big hit in much the same manner.  Some nice work by the supporting cast adds to the fun.

736573,4,6303935516,"Something to Sing About was Grand National Studios's big hope to compete with MGM and the other big studios in the field; Jimmy Cagney was having one of his feuds with Warner Brothers and they thought the film would make Grand National a true success once and for all. Unfortunately, however, the studio spent a lot on the film and even though Cagney gives a stellar performance as he always did, it didn't save the studio--they closed a mere three years after this film was released. As far as the movie itself goes, it's not as bad as other people may think. The plot is nothing special but I liked the musical numbers--Cagney dances up a storm especially in the first scene in the film and Evelyn Daw as Cagney's love interest sings quite nicely, too.

When the film starts, we meet Terry Rooney (Cagney) whose real name is Thadeus McGillicuddy as we eventually find out. Terry and his band play music in a fine nightclub and they're happy as clams about it. Terry's girlfriend Rita Wyatt (Evelyn Daw) sings with the band and that rounds out the happy mood for the opening of the film. Then the action starts--Terry is going to Hollywood to make a film even though he thinks he won't be much of a success; and when the studio head Bennett O. 'B.O.' Regan (Gene Lockhart) instructs the cast and crew to tell Terry he stinks in a plot to fool him into a lower paying long term contract, it all works a little too well! The film wows audiences and the studio wants more films with Terry playing the lead opposite snooty star Stephanie 'Steffie' Hajos (Mona Barrie); but in the meanwhile Terry calls his girlfriend Rita, has her fly out to San Francisco where they made the film and then the two marry and go off on a South Seas voyage. They're impossible to reach because the ship's crew don't know about Terry's success any more than he does; and the studio is baffled as to where Terry ""disappeared.""

Much more happens but I'm not about to spoil it for you. Look also for William Frawley as the movie studio's executive; he does a great job here. The quality of the print, however, is not that good.

Overall, Something to Sing About may not be Jimmy Cagney's best film; but I liked it nonetheless. It was terrific to see him acting in some amusing scenes as well.

736576,3,6303935516,"""Something to Sing About"" is a slight musical made by Jimmy Cagney after his first break from Warner Brothers in 1936. Produced without the expertise and resources of a large studio, it is a modest affair which focuses on its magnetic star in a song and dance role. The music is pleasant, Cagney's dancing is always entertaining and there are some good songs with delightful arrangements. The plot takes band leader Cagney to Hollywood to become a star and it is entirely believable that some of the pot shots at stardom came from Cagney's own experiences. The film has some nice ideas but the pace is lethargic compared to the dynamic Warner's product and the editing is sub standard. Sure enough, Cagney returned to Warner's for his next film!
