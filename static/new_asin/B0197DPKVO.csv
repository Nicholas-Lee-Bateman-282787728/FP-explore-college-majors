7565017,5,B0197DPKVO,I thought this to be a tastefully done movie concerning an important issue of older men who lack scruples preying on vulnerable young women. I wish the young woman had actually written the book that gives the movie its title. I would have ordered it immediately!,1451606400,2,262,4.717391304347826
7565018,5,B0197DPKVO,"Emily VanCamp nails the role of ""Alice"". This could have been a mundane film, if not for the actors who handle a delicate theme admirably and lead the viewer to the descent conclusion (although only in movieland).  Ana Mulvoy-Tenet, the actress who plays young Alice is perfect as a nieve girl with intelligent eyes.  Poor Michael Nyqvist (great actor!) gets the part of the creepy older writer preying on a young vulnerable girl.  But the girl becomes a woman (acted by Emily VanCamp), and comes to terms with all it.  The viewer is forced to see her crazy behavior from vantage point of her shocked friends and from that of her internal struggle.  Interesting in the context of a NY Publishing company.  Nicely done!",1451433600,2,718,4.75

7565020,2,B0197DPKVO,"Yes, it's sad to think of any adult male taking advantage of a young girl, who doesn't have the maturity to make adult decisions. This movie seems to cover much more than that story, however. This movie covers the reasons why this young girl was open and vulnerable to the inappropriate relationship that the man in this movie put himself into a position to force upon her.  Sexual assault is not glamorous or romantic for the victim; it also is not asked for or wanted by the victim.  In this case, the young girl was neglected in part by her parents and looked for attention wherever it might be found; a predator insinuated himself into a position to take advantage of the situation.  My sister was a foster parent, and I saw the devastation such abuse causes in the lives of the young victims of sexual assault.  Thank goodness for people like my sister and her family who are willing to give these kids a stable environment, at least while the kids are in foster care.",1451088000,4,973,4.511363636363637
7565021,5,B0197DPKVO,"Just being able to watch Emily VanCamp for a couple of hours warrants at least 4 stars.  Seriously, this movie is really good.  When Alice (Emily VanCamp) was just a teenager, she was inspired by and infatuated with writer Michael (Milan Daneker) a 40ish friend of the family.  Alice is a talented, intelligent young woman but she is quickly taken advantage of by her older mentor.  Fifteen years later Alice is working for a book publishing company, struggling to find her own way as a writer.  She is forced to confront her past when Michael shows up at her work to have his new book launched.  This movie is well worth renting.",1451088000,4,630,4.580357142857143
7565022,5,B0197DPKVO,This movie was surprisingly great from start to finish. It pinpoint sexual abuse and the expectations of 'living a normal' life afterwards. I think the movie was very relatable and whomever watches it will definitely enjoy it.,1451001600,,226,5.135135135135135
7565023,4,B0197DPKVO,"This was a riveting look at the devastation caused by child sexual abuse and neglect.

I felt I had to keep monitoring myself as I watched, wondering if I would have been more or less disturbed if the story was set in a trailer park, and not among the elite in New York City.

We are used to seeing sexual abuse in film, as the end result of poverty, with Alice's mirror image as a drug addict and prostitute.

Do we, or should we feel the same kind of sympathy for the rich girl?  Are the neglectful, narcissistic parents as repugnant?  Does the abuser come across as the monster he really is?

CPS is not involved, the pedophile writes an acclaimed novel, really about his own experience abusing the young girl, includes a suggestive dedication (in the new release) even using his victim's first name, and nobody seems the wiser how he came up with such realistic insights into the depths of a teenage girl's psyche. Not so surprising, when her own parents don't protect her when she tells her mother, they basically prostitute her for the sake of a book about the abuse of their own daughter.

Can we quantify pain?  Is the life of a young woman robbed of her soul easier in nicer clothes?

Of course, the money and privilege helped Alice.  It at least provided the stability of a home, and a top education which allowed her, along with connections, to have a career to support herself.

I WAS disappointed by the use of the list of reasons why Emmett should forgive her. She was a talented, but blocked writer, from a literary family. It could have been a powerful cathartic scene if she had written something profound.

Although the audience is given hope that Alice will find happiness, it could have been an opportunity for the actress to show what she was about. Instead it seemed obsequious and incongruous, like something out of a Lindsay Lohan movie.

I am not familiar with the writer or director, but it felt a bit like the inevitable mid-movie song, we are used to seeing, with the ""girls"" having a sleepover and choreographed dance routine, because director is not sure the movie is good enough without a little pick-me-up.
It pays to stick to your guns, because giving in often shows a glaring lack of self confidence.",1450915200,,2234,4.582914572864322

7565026,4,B0197DPKVO,"It's almost impossible to review this one without spoiling it, but here's my attempt:

Alice (Emily VanCamp) is a New York publishing house junior editor with the background of an uptown girl born into the literary world (her father is a prominent publishing agent). Despite the privileged upbringing, her family life failed her and was inadequate enough to result in tragic circumstances that she's still struggling to overcome. Alice is turning 29, but the film includes a series of flashbacks between present-day and 16-year-old Alice (Ana Mulvoy-Ten). The antagonist is Milan (Michael Nyqvist), a diabolical but outwardly respectable man who wrote a highly regarded book at Alice's expense (one might say by stealing her life).

If you are suffering from ""flashback fatigue"" (the now-ubiquitous mechanism for weaving a narrative), rest assured that at least the frequent jumping back and forth in time here is well thought out, with attempts to logically connect scenes of past and present. The script is sometimes hard-hitting and generally effective, and the actors pull off their characters with conviction. VanCamp's face is one of familiarity, even if you don't know it from 89 episodes of Revenge, 75 of Brothers & Sisters, 89 of Everwood, and now the Captain America flicks. Ana Mulvoy-Ten, who is 23, frighteningly passes for 16 in this movie. Nyqvist, a Swedish actor with a long filmography, is so convincing in this role that you wonder if he isn't creepy by nature. To top it off, Manhattan is the setting (the most logical for this particular plot), the landscape of which is captured in numerous shots.

 Final thoughts  The Girl in the Book is not an exceptional story, but it's also not one you'll soon forget. For those who don't like abrupt, ambiguous endings: this one is instead softly cathartic, so don't worry about being left in the lurch.",1450310400,16,1866,5.06514657980456
7565027,4,B0197DPKVO,I was pleasantly surprised. I did not think that I would enjoy this film but could not stop watching it. It shows the long-term effects of it inappropriate relationship between an older man and a teenage woman in a very engaging way. The story moved quickly and I found the flashbacks to be very well done. Solid acting all around and the movie moved at a brisk pace.,1459036800,,367,4.411764705882353
7565028,1,B0197DPKVO,"Three minutes in I knew the origins of this movie - i.e. northeast region, most likely NY. How, you ask? Will you probably didn't but here it is. It must have something to do with the high levels of atmospheric, land & water pollution that has delayed cognitive development in that region. It seems that every other movie that has the ""I Love NY"" bumper sticker in the ending credits has as it's storyline soft porn; dysfunctional relationships; restaurants & eating (w/alcohol, too); lots of face to face dialogue that is at the high school sophomoric love crush readability level.
Mechanics rating:
1. Memorize a line, regurgitate, cut, edit, next line, and on and on.
2. No special features, but then nothing special to feature.
3. No subtitles for those that need them or to just hear important dialogue (not important in this case).",1458518400,2,837,4.819444444444445

7565031,3,B0197DPKVO,"I have mixed feelings about this film. I've read most of the other reviews and I agree with parts of them, which I'll mention here.

What I liked:  the theme is a worthy one.  Many viewers wrote in their reviews that they felt it portrayed the subject of sexual abuse in a realistic way that they found helpful.

The acting was generally good.  Michael Nyquist who played the author/predator was very convincing.  The many who played the bad dad was wonderful.  His toothy grin while he decided what everyone else in the room should be doing was great. Emily VanCamp, the lead actress was quite engaging.  She is on screen most of the time and had to have a strong presence to hold your attention.  I think she had a hard time in the ""babysitter"" scene but that was not an easy one to pull off.  I didn't like the self righteous environmental activist guy but that may not have been the fault of the actor, more of the writer, who gave him a pretty one-dimensional character to play.  Frankly I didn't find him attractive at all and thought the lead girl could do better, but that was my personal opinion.  The Asian best buddy was well played but this leads into my dislikes:

What I disliked were the clich&eacute;d characters.  Again the bad dad was a rype.  Haven't we seen this guy all over the place--the successful man in his field who provides financially for his children but neglects them emotionally?  I guess that as long as these types still exist in reality, they'll still pop up in films.

The Best Buddy/Sidekick.  This is another type that I'm really tired of.  She is carefully never as attractive as the lead but has a big heart and serves as the support, moral compass to the lead.  Mary Tyler Moore had her Rhoda, Lucy had her Ethel, etc. etc.  In recent years the part has been filled by an ethnic minority, often a Black, here an Asian..

The obvious good guys vs the obvious bad guys.  This was portrayed in such a heavy handed way that I tended to react against it.  I hated the self righteous environmental activist who was supposed to be the polar opposite of the duplicitous creeps in the publishing industry.  It's true that the girl made a serious error of judbment in having sex with the babysitter but I file the moral outrage on the part of this guy as well as the best buddy, seemed to be lacking in heart.  They both claimed to love the girl but didn't allow her much slack in this case.  After all this was a culture in which casual sex was the norm.  These were not Amish farm folks. They were not  married, engaged, living together nor in a long term committed  relationship. I found their moral outrage on the part of this guy as well as Best Buddy, to be a little hypocritical as well as heartless.

Another viewer wrote that she din't like any of the characters and I felt the same way.  I'm not sure why...maybe because they weren't real.  They were ideas-types in some writers head.  THe whole film was very formulaic---we are shown very clearly the bad dad, the bad sexual predator, the bad boss.as compared to the good Best Buddy and impeccably politically correct new boyfriend.  Not to mention, the ever present adorable toddler who is ""a great kid.""

The flashbacks to the earlier time when the ""event"" took place were done well although I found the performance of Anna Mulvoy-Ten who portrayed the younger version  of  the Girl to be somewhat lacking.  I understand that the actress was in her late 20's which may account for how her attempt at portraying the young teenager as innocent just comes across as clueless.. It wasn't clear to me how long this alleged sexual abuse went on for nor how much it involved.  Did they sleep with each other or was this a case of his fondling her one time?  A one time event was indeed creepy but if's very different than if they had an ongoing sexual relationship. Did she fall in love with him?  Also I doubt that a teenager growing up in that environment would have been as wide eyed and innocent as was portrayed.  The film tells us that the writer stole her innocence as well as her ideas.  Which was supposed to be the more devastating to the Girl?

Some other things I liked---the blog of 100 reasons the guy should come back to her, the way the Best Buddy swiped the dulce leche from the Girl's shopping bag.  The title is great---very evocative and mysterious..

In sum, there's a lot to like in this film  My main objection is that it is too formulaic.  It has a mathematical correctness to it.  Problem created by-bad parenting, and problem solved by righteous friends.  It was too pat to be convincing. I spite of the good acting none of the characters made me really care about them.  I just saw a video of wildlife in Africa entitles, ""Nature has No Script.""  This film could have used some of that naturalness.  This is the kind of things that Europeans do so well and Americans seem not to have caught on to how to do.",1457481600,,4921,4.463524130190797

7565043,4,B0197DPKVO,"This movie could have easily be 5-star for me but the relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist is a bit hard to believe. Of course, the psychological underpinnings which result in the relationship are understandable and believable, so I found my way to acceptance. Still, I cringed at the thought. For someone who has been a victim of a cowardly, narcissistic woman or man, this will resound and hopefully help him or her in recovering from such despicable abuse. The events which transpire, ultimately explain the path to some measure of healing which can be a terribly bumpy path at that.",1455321600,,605,4.9411764705882355
7565044,3,B0197DPKVO,"I did view this movie, written and directed by Marya Cohn, quite awhile ago and it has been on my mind ever since. I cannot deny that the acting is quite good in many places, but what it is based on and mainly its resolution just does not gel for me. As the story begins in Manhattan's upscale publishing world with a now basically twenty-nine-year-old Alice (Emily VanCamp) as a junior editor, she must immediately deal with a man who is bringing in drafts of a novel he just finished. This is no ordinary man to Alice, Milan Daneker (Michael Nyqvist), as he has completely based his masterpiece novel on the younger sixteen-year-old Alice portrayed by Ana Mulvoy-Ten, naming it Waking Eyes. Daneker is hired by her father in order to advise her with lessons in writing abilities. He is never questioned about all of the time he is taking with her and how often they meet. Basically, Daneker steals Alices youth from her in several unquestionable ways and becomes a famous novelist; but what of Alice and her future?

What takes place is despicable and how it continues is even worse for me as the viewer. He begins sexually abusing her at this younger and delicate age wanting her to show him all of her work, taking and choosing her carefully crafted texts and building it into his own novel while completely taking advantage of this trusting girl (""I've been living in her shadows for fifteen years"" - older Alice cries out). For Alice to see him now as she is older and in her own workplace is crushing. The film follows a back and forth manner from younger to present day Alice as she is now at a point where she cannot form lasting or trusting relationships with men. While still sixteen, she tells her mother about what is happening and is met by her fathers opinion, It is perfectly normal to have feelings for someone you look up to, and this with Daneker present? This creates such confusion in Alice not believed by her own parents.

The biggest issue besides the abuse, which is diabolical enough, is when Alice is older and cannot form intimate relationships, she can only seek out promiscuous types of behavior which are so common for many who have been abused in this manner. It now fills a void in her to feel needed, necessary - anything but completely used up. She never gets sound therapy, is left to her own devices to take care of her devastated life. The horrid thing is that this abuse happens all of the time and to have a film bring it to light once more without offering an unwavering plan for Alice to really become well truly befuddled me. I cannot see this happening just through another relationship that may go south. Who can really tell? I can only see this happening if Alice takes the steps towards her own recovery. There is some exceptionally good acting involved but a  topic so heartrending' met with no real resolution in sight for me. If only the premise of how Alice could receive concrete help to go forward plausibly would have been introduced, this would have been a completely well-rounded movie.",1455148800,5,3042,4.598526703499079
