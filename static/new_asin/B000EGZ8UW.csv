8109610,4,B000EGZ8UW,"It wasn't as clear as I thought it would be.  Since purchasing the video I had a TTouch practitioner come and show me personally how to best perform it on my cat - there were significant differences and most importantly, some major details were not perceivable in the video.

All in all, it is still a good base from which to get familiar with the method.",1384300800,3,355,4.363636363636363
8109611,5,B000EGZ8UW,"Instead of showing how the technique works on ""perfect,"" well-trained cats, Ms. Tellington-Jones shows the technique on cats who need it. Sure, the quality of the video is on par with what you'd find on Youtube--but it's the content that really matters. This product is for people to gain the trust and improve the disposition of cats who hide from or attack people or just don't like people. I had seen some of these techniques many years ago when Ms. Tellington-Jones was on a TV show and when I had a roommate who got a really crazy cat, I tried some of the methods. Worked like a charm. I'm planning to get a new cat, so I prepared by getting this video (waiting for her book which I've ordered as well) and a Zoom Groom which many others recommend for both brushing and massaging a cat.",1366761600,4,791,4.424657534246576
8109612,3,B000EGZ8UW,"I have a very anxious and high strung cat.  He's only two years old and is exhibiting some bad behaviors.  We love this little guy very much and we are trying to help him.  So, I ordered this DVD as I had hoped that learning more about TTouching would help him.

While I believe Ms. Tellington-Jones is very knowledgeable and I believe the TTouch system holds promise; I was disappointed in the DVD.  I was hoping it would go into greater depth and provide more information than it did.",1227657600,5,486,4.415730337078652
8109613,3,B000EGZ8UW,"This is an OK guide. It seems to be for people that don't spend much time patting or playing with their cat - seems a bit simple, but my cat liked some of the techniques, & that's what counts!",1191542400,4,192,3.948717948717949
8109614,5,B000EGZ8UW,"This is an instructional DVD for cat owners who love their pets and wish them to stay as healthy as possible.  I have the VHS which I purchased 12 yrs ago and have recently purchased this DVD.  I have an indoor, healthy, 17 yr old cat and I attribute his long life and good nature to the TTouch. You don't have to do it every week.  I massage my cat twice a month and I don't even execute the whole technique in a sitting but I do alternate parts of technique.  Its powerful stuff and its natural! I  recommend the TTouch to all my friend and family who have dogs,cats,and horses.",1169510400,11,580,4.1891891891891895
