First of all, the cover has nothing to do with the film,  which came out in 1981.  I've seen plenty of low-budget '80s teen comedies, but this one out-low budget's most of them.  If you like non-acting, almost zero plotline, random scenes thrown in for no reason,  and a soundtrack that sounds like it was recorded at home by the producer's nephew, then this is for you.  It's so haphazardly thrown together that it's almost like watching a documentary.  This one didn't go off the rails;  they never even tried getting it on the rails.  It's like they got some random people together and shot a bunch of scenes just hoping it would somehow add up to a movie.  It doesn't.  This is not a movie to watch, exactly, but just to soak in and enjoy the twisted ambiance, preferably with the appropriate libation and/or combustible.  I'd also recommend the first Hollywood High which came out in the '70s and is equally brilliant in other ways.",1485561600,,1036,4.570652173913044
8156694,2,B000KGH04I,"I'm going to be a bit more generous than the other two reviewers because even though this movie is nearly unwatchably bad, it does have some extended nude scenes that probably enticed a few people in their day.

You take out a pool scene or two, though, and this stinker deserves to be lost to the sands of time.

First of all, the writing is painfully bad. Lots of talk about weed smoking and sex. Wow, that's original. One scene features weed smoking and sex but a musical score that sounds like something out of ""The Way We Were.""

Second of all, the acting is excruciating. One actress plays a dumb girl, but I never decided if she was playing dumb or really living the part. She also puts on a fake voice that will induce vomiting if heard for more than two or three minutes. You have been warned.

Third, wow, talk about false advertising: As anybody but a total idiot would know already, the hot girls on the cover are NOT in this film. In fact they very likely weren't even born when this film came out. More disappointing than that is that there isn't anyone in this movie who is even comparable to either woman. What's the opposite of buxom? Buxless? That's what you've got in this movie...quite a bit of toplessless (no bottomlessness), but breasts the size of mosquito bites.

The final point is about direction and editing: It's pretty clear that there wasnt' enough story material here to fill a shot glass, so every take is taken out to its absolute final moment. That's how the movie got to 85 minutes, but you'll swear that it's more like 185 (""Hollywood High 2: The Epic""). We see extended cuts of walks on the beach when...yeah, basically nothing occurs. We see 90-second cuts of walks down concrete pathways and up to front doorsteps. We see two-and-a-half-minute cuts of drives across town. We see pacing that will make you wonder who let the 15-year-old non-credit cinematography student from the local community college into the editing room.

Some movies are so bad that they're...not good exactly, but fun to watch. This movie is so bad that it's just really, really bad.",1254268800,3,2096,4.620967741935484
8156695,1,B000KGH04I,"As a teenager growing up in the mid 1970's, I use to enjoy going to the theaters and watching those cheaply made teenage exploitation films. The original Hollywood High was funny, showed some brief nudity, and simply brought me back to the days of High school innocence. Hollywood High 2 is nothing more than a waste of time! A teenage exploitation film made in the new millenium simply doesn't work! Don't waste your time with this film! If you want to view good teen exploitation movies, watch The Pom Pom Girls, Van Nuys Blvd, The Van, and the original Hollywood High!",1247097600,3,571,4.663366336633663
8156696,1,B000KGH04I,The storyline and camera work were too much of throwback to my drug enhanced youth of the early 80's. I found nothing redeeming in this film at all.,1203033600,4,148,4.321428571428571
