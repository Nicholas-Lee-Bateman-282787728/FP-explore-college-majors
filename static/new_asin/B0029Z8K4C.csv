8358583,4,B0029Z8K4C,"Another Chang Cheh movie featuring a loner who is great with a sword, but here, Ti Lung gets to be the lead character in one of his earliest starring vehicles where he isn't David Chiang's sidekick. If one has had qualms about Chiang being a ""loner"" (some are even not partial to Jimmy Wang Yu's ""loner"" roles), they'll enjoy Ti Lung here....He is a swordsman with a reputation who [otherwise] minds his business, but when  he gets caught up in what is, simply put, a power struggle within a clan, Jin Fei, the King Eagle, is fighting back for justice. Add to this some twists; two of the leaders of the clan are sisters, both played by Lei Ching ( she plays the younger, vain sister as well as the older, nice one very well), and Ti Lung's character is eventually revealed to be a three-dimensional person with emotions (as far as that can get in a Shaw flick). Music cues found in ""One-armed Swordsman"", ""Have Sword, will Travel"" and ""The Wandering Swordman"" are heard here yet again; if this is a shorthand way for the music editor to indicate Ti Lung is a ""loner"", it's okay, but some will gripe (it's a ""B"" picture; sorry). Overall, an overlooked classic now on DVD. Ti lung fans must get this latest Image release!",1256169600,12,1220,4.495495495495495
