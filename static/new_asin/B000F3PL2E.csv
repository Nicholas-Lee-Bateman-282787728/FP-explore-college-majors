2714157,4,B000F3PL2E,Good movie. Nice to see a movie that is about a real cowboy. Dirt mud and blood. No fast cars in this one. Convict cowboy was refreshing. Exciting and felt real,1409788800,,160,4.193548387096774

2714166,4,B000F3PL2E,"I really enjoyed this film. It's an older one but the story is applicable to all times. It's the older, more experienced man teaching the younger one some of the realities of life. It gives you hope for the younger, misfits future.",1400803200,,231,4.523809523809524
2714167,3,B000F3PL2E,"This movie had a script that we have all seen before.  Cool Hand Luke meets Urban Cowboy, but any movie with Jon Voight deserves to be seen.",1393977600,,140,4.185185185185185
2714168,4,B000F3PL2E,"I ordered this double feature DVD for my son, who wanted the second feature.

Otherwise it has been satisfactory.",1392422400,,290,4.647058823529412

2714170,2,B000F3PL2E,"""Convict Cowboy"" (1995) is a made for television, modern-day-heterosexual-movie-western starring Jon Voight as Ry Weston and Kyle Chandler as Clay Treyton. You may recognize the obvious allusion to ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969), which won 3 Oscar Awards, in which Voight also starred. Despite the similar title and shared actor, Convict won no awards, although the director, Rod Holcomb, made a commendable effort.

The film starts with a simple formula: Voight is shown atop a bull, riding it hard to take the prize. In short order, the director reveals that the bull ride takes place within the confines of a prison rodeo. Next, we happen upon a drunken Chandler as he stumbles about some western downtown street. Chandler causes a bit of property damage, fights with the police officers, and gets himself arrested and thrown into jail for two years, where he meets Voight. Voight is serving out a life sentence for murder, but has been granted the privileges of a trustee as he supervises the prison ranch.

Voight and Chandler meet when Chandler connives his way onto Voight's ranch detail. The scenes which follow serve to develop the characters of both actors, and are reasonably well filmed. Unfortunately, the director creates story arcs which the characters are not fleshed-out enough to properly resolve.

With a run time of 98 minutes, you get the feeling that this film could have finished up in about an hour. Some of the problems this movie presents are pretty standard for television fare: Voight's action scenes atop bucking broncos and bulls are all shot in slow motion atop a still set piece - Voight does not straddle a living animal during these competitions. Also, the romance between Voight and Marcia Gay Harden, who plays a veterinarian, has nowhere to go - it stops at just one kiss. That leaves the obvious friendship between Voight and Chandler - surely their relationship will be developed more fully - but unfortunately, it isn't. Aside from a drawn out fistfight and a few cheesy bits of romantic advice from Chandler to Voight on how to woo women, there is very little bedrock on which to base their camaraderie.

Where does that leave our film? Well, nowhere, really. Ben Gazzara, playing a prison warden, is meant to convey to us that Voight has never stood up for any other inmate the way he stands up for Chandler - but the moment arrives too soon, and is simply not believable. At the film's conclusion, its empty nature becomes apparent: Voight is still a prisoner, and Chandler hasn't really learned much at all.

The story may fall flat, but the scenery and set pieces are exceptional. That is one recommendation I can give this film. The director uses lots of livestock - horses, bulls and calves. There are also views of rolling plains and great, open fields, which give the film a sense of western space and freedom. The prison is most likely a real one. The rodeo takes place on what appears to be a professional rodeo circuit.

If you are looking for a deeper, more intelligent film, be sure to purchase or rent Midnight Cowboy, starring Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. Convict Cowboy seems to be a cheap and bawdy homage to the earlier film. Although Voight does all that is asked, Convict fails on most levels - but we'll give the director an ""A"" for effort.",1391212800,,3298,4.818021201413427
2714171,3,B000F3PL2E,its ok p.g.s but have seen lot better movies and we need more updated movies too many old movies not enough good westerns,1390953600,,121,4.304347826086956

2714173,5,B000F3PL2E,"I wasn't sure what to make of this when I read the description, but the strong character development and taut storyline kept me watching.  Much of the action takes place on a ranch operated by the prison where Voight is a lifer.  The almost-love-story with Harden is poignant without being silly or contrived.",1388793600,,309,4.811320754716981
