There is no question that its impossible for us to know everything, but with study, insight and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we can come close enough to definitively determine a few key things that Doug lays out clearly and succinctly.

I have enjoyed Doug's Bible teaching for years now, and this is DVD presentation of his lecture about the Genetics of the Incarnation is 5-Stars, excellent, superb.",1402704000,,584,5.0
