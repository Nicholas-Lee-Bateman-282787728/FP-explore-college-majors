1777644,5,B00006IUFQ,"When I saw the announcement of this box set I was immediately returned to what was one of the best anime series without subtitles and very credible voice acting. Like another person who commented, it brought me right back to those days when I was going to school, and I would rush home to catch Robotech. The big difference between this and many other kids shows that were on TV at that time, was that this one displayed characters who had very real emotions and very multifacted personalities and attributes. I'll confess that as soon as I started watching the first DVD it was hard to stop that night, the stories are engaging and the characters are entertaining. In many ways I only wish that the story itself allowed for even more time into introspection and seeing what was going through the minds of the characters, but I guess only a well written Robotech book would provide this. If you enjoy anime, want to watch something without the need to read subtitles and want to watch the unfolding of a great story, then get this box set. It's alot more than just robots/mecha/aliens fighting each other, this one has a real story going on through the whole series.",1033689600,2,1166,4.610576923076923

The reason for my 3 star rating is simple.  The lack of extras and the lack of digital restoration.  As for the extras, there are none.  Except for previews for 4 other anime titles in each of the discs, this is about as bare-bones as you can get.  I wouldn't watch the previews first before catching any of the episodes, because these previews for recent releases have sharp, state-of-the-art animation that spoils the dated and murky-looking animation offered here in the ""Robotech: The Macross Saga"" series.  Don't get me wrong, the story is still great, but unlike the recent 9-disc original Macross set released in Japan (featuring original storyline, and cleaned-up transfer), ""Robotech: The Macross Saga"" appears as murky and grainy as you would expect an 80's animation to appear without the benefit of digital restoration.
I can see the reason why this box-set was created.  Most mid 20-something to early 30-something individuals who would want to buy this box-set clearly have ""Macross"" in mind, when they want to re-live their nostalgia for ""Robotech."" Like myself, they are not necessarily  hardcore fans and completists, who would not want to shellout extra bucks for ""Southern Cross"" and ""The New Generation"" for their DVD library.  Just think of a ""Star Trek: The Next Genration"" fan who is not particularly interested in ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""Voyager,"" and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about...
Also, the casual fans who may be interested in ""Macross,"" may want to purchase this edition, because the American-English language version is the one that they grewup with, as well as their fondness for the Zentraedi backstory created by Carl Macek.  As good as the Japanese version of the original Macross is to the Macross purists and the diehard Robotech fans out there, nostalgia beckons casual Robotech fans to re-visit the ""Macross"" series they grewup with (complete with American-English dialogue, character name changes, and Zentradi storyline..) on American and Canadian television.
Finally, for those who want to have the Japanese Macross set (the recently released set with the digital restoration), but cannot afford the $200.00+ price tag, this ""Robotech: The Macross Saga"" boxed-set is a great way to buy this (this portion of the Robotech series, anyway..) for 1/4 of the cost of its much more expensive Japanese counter-part.
If I had known about the arrival of this box-set 9-months ago, would I have awaited the release of this 6-disc set all this time, just to save [money]?  No way, I couldn't wait...back then, I wanted to have this baby, NOW!!!  :)",1033603200,8,2595,5.08235294117647
1777646,5,B00006IUFQ,"What you see here is pretty much what you get, and I'm not complaining.  It's not elegantly packaged or loaded with extras, but this collection of Robotech's Macross episodes (all of them, 1-36) has one of the most addictive mixes of character, plot, and outright action ever to grace after-school cartoons.
I bought this 6-DVD collection just days ago to scratch a lingering itch for a show that I was obsessed with when I was 9 or 10 years old.  I'm 29 now, but Robotech still hasn't lost its ability to suck you right in: A spaceship crashes onto a small island and the world comes together trying to figure out how to restore it; aliens come after the ship and intergalactic hell breaks loose, leading us on a space-epic of whose emotional detail and energy Tolstoy or Hugo would definitely have approved.  You've got a rising pop chanteuse, the boys who love her, the prissy administrator who'll charm you later, the fighter jocks, the Star Search moments...  Ah, it's grand.  Yeah, of course, it's kitschy, and in a way no 9 year old would have grasped, but it's still hours (about FIFTEEN hours, if you can handle it!) of fun.
The only annoying thing--but some might not find this annoying--is that the commercial-break announcements are still there.  It's nice that the commercials aren't, but they're still distracting, as are the credits at the beginning and end of each episode.  Since it's a DVD, you can of course punch your way through it with ease, but it would have been nicer just to be able to float in one seamless 900-minute stream of Robotech.
If you're a hardcore fan, you might do well to buy the more completely and minutely detailed Legacy Collection box sets.  I've got one of them, and it's nicely packaged and full of extras (like technology sketches, plot outlines, etc.), but I'll likely be selling it now.  What got me addicted to Robotech in the first place, back when I was knee-high to a grasshopper, wasn't the planes, it was the people.  This Complete Collection has everything I need: 900 minutes of sheer anime bliss, at a great, compact price.",1033084800,42,2082,4.695054945054945
1777647,5,B00006IUFQ,"for some reason, i recieved this on the 21st of september, as opposed to the 24th, and i can say that this is an amazing anime. there is a reason they say that this was what brought the love of anime to the US, and there is no mistake that this series is one of the best. ""in the year 1999, high above macross island in the south pacific, a phenomenon occured in the skies that changed the course of human history"" these are the words of the narrator as the object later called the super demensional fortress macross crashed into macross island, and as the humans began to rebuild this giant behemoth of a machine, a city grew up araound it, and they developed a great technology, which allowed a fighter to transform into a mix between a mech and a fighter, and even to a mech itself. this is a very indepth war story, so prepare yourself for the unexpected.",1032652800,4,859,4.308641975308642
1777648,5,B00006IUFQ,"Robotech: Counter Strike, contains Episodes 68 - 73 of the ultra-intense third story arc (The New Generation) in the classic, ground-breaking, epic Americanized anime series from the 80s, Robotech.
For the uninitiated, Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z,  etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, high-tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
THE STORY:
Several years after the events of the Robotech Masters saga, the deadly alien menace known as the Invid, attracted by the dispersal of the Flower of Life and Protoculture, have conquered the Earth, subjugating mankind to its rule.  Out of these ashes rises a resistance movement of Robotech freedom fighters committed to reclaiming the home world and vanquishing the Invid conquerors...
Thought by many to be the best of the three Robotech story arcs, these stories provide a great look into a Post-Apocalyptic earth full of colonies of survivors and their alien tormentors.  The constant battles for survival of the heroes show the true intensity and drama of this series.  Overall, the action and drama are very compelling.
This volume features the continuing saga of the New Generation as the fighters continue on their treacherous trek to Reflex Point and learn more about their deadly enemies, the Invid!!!
THE EPISODES:
Here's a rundown of the episodes featured on this DVD:
Episode 68 - Eulogy:  Scott and his Freedom Fighters arrive in a soldier town where Robotech soldiers enjoy a peaceful, laid back lifestyle.  Here Scott meets up with one of his idols, Colonel Jonathan Wolfe, a hero of the Robotech Wars.  Like in other towns though not all is as it seems here, and Colonel Wolfe is not the same person that Scott remembers...
Episode 69 - The Genesis Pit:  Robotech meets Jurassic Park!!  Scott, Rand and Annie stumble into an underground cavern full of prehistoric creatures, revealing to them the Invid's diabolical plans for genetic evolution!!!
Episode 70 - Enter Marlene:  The heroes journey to Point K, an advance base for the REF and (to Scott's horror) stumble across the remains of a vast REF armada.  While searching through the ruins, the gang finds and salvages more weapons (including the Beta Fighter) and gain a new member, the mysterious amnesiac girl whom they dub ""Marlene"" -- who in herself, is not what she seems to be...
Episode 71 -  The Secret Route:  A look into Lancer's past as the gang meets up with a woman from his past while battling a crooked politician as they pass through a town on their trek to Reflex Point.  Plus, has Annie FINALLY found her man???
Episode 72 -  The Fortress:  To get to Reflex Point the gang must first get past a near invulnerable Invid mountain fortress.  Can Rand and Annie knock out the Invid sensors to give the gang a fighting chance?  Plus, more revelations about the Invid.
Episode 73 - Sandstorms:  Tensions start to run high between some of the gang forcing Rand out into a raging Sandstorm which knocks him into a pit of the Invid's Flower of Life, sending him into a hallucinatory dreamworld where he continues to learn more about the Invid's intentions while shedding some of his feelings for Scott, Marlene and the others.
Incidentally, these volumes DO NOT have special DVD features (aside from trailer ads for other anime series coming out on DVD from ADV).  Not to fear though.  If you purchase the boxed set collections, each boxed set collection will come with an ""Extra:  Elements of Robotechnology"" DVD special which will contain all the DVD special features you could want:  interviews, trailers, commercial spots, specs, etc... So by all means, get the boxed set if you are planning on buying.
THE VERDICT:
Many feel that the New Generation story arc is by far the best out of all three of the Robotech story arcs, including the Macross Saga, and with good reason.  The ultra-cool mecha and the ULTRA-INTENSE action as Scott Bernard's band of fighters literally run and fight for their lives against the Invid is compelling and dramatic and contains all the action you could look for, with less emphasis on the love stories that the previous arcs had.
If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture icon.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane. You can't lose!!!

1777649,4,B00006IUFQ,"Robotech is a trilogy series composed of the Macross Saga, Robotech Masters Saga and The Next Generation Saga. All three parts span a time of forty-six years. This part of the series is the Macross Saga, in which Rick Hunter a young pilot is thrust into battle for the survival of the Human Race. Rick and his friends Lisa Hayes, Ben Dixin, and Max Sterling attempt to protect their home of the SDF-1 and the city of Macross, which now resides in the great ship. We get to see the characters develop in their own ways and help to protect two species from total destruction.

In recent years I came back to the series after I got into model building and I got the destroids (this was also because of BattleTech of course).

Came across this and have now watched the entire first season hahaha.

And damn... I forgot just how nonchalant this show was about killing off characters. Roy is fine... nope *spoiler* dead. One episode later Ben Dixon is killed. End of the series the entire Bridge Crew of the Super Dimension fortress is killed....

1777709,5,B00006IUFQ,"Rewatching this was awesome, but I recommend watching original Japanese versions with subtitles. I think the one thing that struck me, and probably some translation bad, was Yellow Dancer/Lancer. Scott was considered hardcore, but in the Japanese version, YD/Lancer was even as much a soldier to the end. In the episode where it was revealed why he was a transdresser,  and ensuing episodes, you realized he was a hard core soldier as much as Scott was. I thought he and Scott's farewells in Dark Finale (next to last episode) summed it up better to their dedication to the cause, and protecting their friends and telling them to stay back, then the Harmony Gold version. The Japanese original, for their part, more militaristic.",1479254400,,729,4.975409836065574

1777711,1,B00006IUFQ,"It's EXTREMELY frustrating that Amazon keeps stripping classic titles like this of their original voice tracks (often the work of A-list voice actors) to replace them with stilted low-quality English translations.

Why ruin good shows by forcing customers to watch translated versions? The original language soundtrack should be the top priority, with translated English, Spanish, Mandarin and other languages as a secondary benefit.  One star.",1475193600,3,444,5.815384615384615
1777712,1,B00006IUFQ,"If you watched ROBOTECH as a kid, nothing will change your mind. It would have become a formative aspect of your childhood. However, if you have never watched Robotech, don't watch it. Go and watch MACROSS which is also on Amazon Prime now (with English subtitles). Macross is the original Japanese anime, and it is a very sophisticated, very touching story. Robotech changes significant aspects of the dialog, so that scenes in Macross that make my eyes tear up, will look ridiculous in Robotech with not just changed dialog, but added dialog. (One very touching scene between the main characters comes to mind). The love story between the characters is an important plot element and Robotech downplays that, making it more lighthearted (probably to make it more suitable for children). AFTER watching Macross (TV series) you can find a way to watch the movie version called ""The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? ( ). The story in the movie is actually a bit different from the series but the music is even more amazing. Oh yes, they changed the music for Robotech also. The original Japanese music is hauntingly beautiful. Don't spoil your experience, watch Macross, not Robotech. It is very rare for this quality of anime to be produced, and arguably Macross is the best anime ever. Nothing comes close (those who think otherwise probably got contaminated by Robotech at an early age and there is no way to recover from that).",1475107200,10,1452,4.90650406504065

Robotech is just stagnant and has not progressed because it's success relied primarily on Macross. Macross is one I still watch to this day. Unfortunately, I sometimes have get the newer macross shows from other sources because Harmony Gold is being stubborn about the rights (at least as far as my knowledge of the legal disputes with Big West, Macross rights holders, go) and not letting Macross be distributed in North America and Europe. This is strange because as far as I can tell, nobody (apart from the older fans anyway) seems to give a crap about Robotech anymore. Yes I give it credit for introducing anime to the west (at least making it more well known) and for introducing me to Macross, and on the whole I thank Carl Macek for everything he did for anime fandom in the U.S. but now I think Harmony Gold needs to let Macross go.",1471478400,5,924,4.505952380952381

1777834,5,B00006IUFQ,"And so we come to the second act of Robotech, & my personal favorite so far.  Remember how I said I had given up on Robotech 2 episodes after Force of Arms?  I hadn't given up on it completely.  I happened to tune in one day to Dana's Story.  I decided to give it another chance, especially when I got a glimpse of things to come.  I tuned out when I realized it was just going to be a clip show, but knew I would have to tune in next time.  I never missed any other episode of this saga.  I liked it better as a kid because it of more action & no love triangle, and now... it's still my favorite overall.  I'm surprised at how underrated this saga is.  You get a feel for just about every character in this series, even some of the one-shot characters still linger in my mind.  I really liked all the heroes, especially Dana, Shaun & Bowie (another reason I like this better is because the black person doesn't die last, or first for that matter).  The action is constant & always exciting.  And I'm sorry, the mecha in this series are all awesome looking, especially the AJAX.  The only flaw though is that it took a bit to get going.  The only real standouts in the first quarter are False Start which was pretty good & Southern Cross which ranked A.  The other 3 are watchable as opposed to the clip show, but not ones I would be dying to see again.  Things peak in the next quarter.  Let me just say that the weakest episode in it was Prelude To Battle which I gave an A-, the next 5 are A/A+.  And it's the same for the rest of the saga, apart from Dana In Wonderland, which was good but not fantastic.  The last 4 episodes are so much better than the Macross Saga finale.  But still, it's better to start out weak & end with a bang than to start out strong & go out with a whimper like the Macross Saga did.  I highly recommend you at least give this a try.  So now with the dream in pieces, we should go on a journey.  Do you remember that old lullaby?  You will, as we meet the lonely soldier boys of Robotech New Generation, looking for where the amber colored dream is.",1378771200,4,2080,4.091584158415841

1777853,1,B00006IUFQ,"Robotech is not anime: it is a series of 3 anime that were reedited and dubbed, and the actual story material was thrown out and replaced by a storyline that was essentially made up. Since the dialogue has nothing to do with the original dialogue, and the story has only the loosest connection to the the original, this can't be called an anime: you can't have a movie or TV show, and throw out the the actual story and dialogue and just keep the picture.

Robotech was a cheap jack attempt to cash in on a classic anime series, done with horrible rewriting and terrible dubbing. IT'S NOT A CLASSIC. MACROSS is a classic, Robotech is mutilation of a classic. You can't make something great 'better' by ruining it. Macross is considered a classic the world over...Robotech is loved by a few people with arrested development, in some of the english speaking countries.

It's important that the lies robotech fans tell about this show are balanced by the truth and the facts: otherwise some poor, unknowing sucker might be fooled into buying this garbage. To even watch this horrible show means that you just can't tell how bad it is: Robotech did NOTHING for anime, except give it a reputation for being schlock and kiddie fare that no adult would want to watch. It did NOTHING to popularize anime, because it isn't anime at all. I'm just telling potential buyers the truth about this show, so they won't walk into this fooled

No, it is not anime: anime is determinately not ""animation which has been mutilated"". Anime is refers to 'animation' that is produced in japan...since robocrap was NOT produced in japan, it is not anime. Period.

A pioneer of anime? No, as it isn't anime. A huge fan base? No, a tiny group of sad lovers of crap. Representing the anime community? No, representing a dead end of a bad marketing concept, one that thankfully fails every time and leads to losing money (serves them right)., robotech is not 'originating in japan'. Macross originated in japan, robocrap is pure American schlock. So stop calling it anime.

Actually, the correct argument is that there is really no such thing as Robotech: it's just a name slapped on something which already has a legitimate name. So, since Macross is legitimate, Robotech must be illegitimate.",1341100800,2,2265,4.753180661577608

The episodes are clipped to create one continuous movie length volume.  An ingenious idea back in the vhs days of fastforwardforever, but with dvd and bluray, its a horrible thing.  As far as the series itself, its Robotech, you either like it or you don't.  Just be aware that this the episodes from FHE are all clipped.",1338768000,,553,4.65979381443299
1777855,5,B00006IUFQ,"So, I'm not going to rehash what other people have said. If you're here, it's because you're a robotech fan, or know someone who raved about it. The reason this is art worth collecting in a decent edition is that the robotech story that was created to bridge these cartoons was actually greater than the sum of it's parts. I've watched mospeada, macross, etc by themselves, and although they are amazing works of art in their own right, it was the story that Carl Macek and co came up with that is the reason I have such great nostalgic feelings towards this old school anime. The books by Jack McKinney helped to really nail it home.

Now, there are some problems with revisiting Robotech. 25 years hasn't been kind to this series. Some really great advances in anime in the intervening time make watching this for new people, and even for those of us that it was our gateway to anime for, somewhat hard to watch. I suggest the time honored method of having a few drinks prior to watching this, and ignoring those first feelings about quality of production, etc, so you can suspend your disbelief and get into this amazing tale. The 2 best parts are macross and mospeda (1st and 3rd robotech wars in the Robotech parlance) in my opinion, although the 2nd part has its moments, but is quite different in style than the other two.

I've tried to watch Robotech in the past on horribly transferred VHS, less than great DVD transfers and ""missing bits"" streaming via netflix. You know how it is, netflix and other streams are convienient, but even at the highest settings it's not the whole picture, that's why Blu Ray isn't dead. This is by far the best version you can currently get, although it isn't perfect. There are some aliasing artifacts present which are disturbing, probably from the filters they used to clean up the image. I must say tho, this is the best version I've seen on modern equipment. The detail is better, it's formatted for 16x9 which is huge compared to the streaming version, and I actually think the 5.1 mix with the ""new audio effects"" is an improvement on the original. Sure you can kind of tell the sounds are ""new"" and ""wrong"" but they did a really good job, and it helped with me getting into the story and forget about nit-picking the 1983 animation.

So, why is it so great ? The characters. They had feelings, they were real, they made mistakes, they reacted like real people, and had the flaws and attributes of real people. That is why this series is still so beloved. Although I have mixed feelings about the people currently curating Robotech (Tommy Yune and Harmony Gold) at least you can say they helped this release get made, They have good intentions and are running a business. What robotech REALLY needs, is a modern reboot, with the US storyline, and redraw the whole thing with some improvements and twists in 2012 era animation. NOT in 3D, which usually sucks and/or is jarring. (see Shadow Chronicles for why.) Of course, for legal and financial reasons, that is unlikely ever to happen in our lifetime.

Anyway, This is the edition you should pick up if you want to own it but don't have it. It's better than any other version when upscaled by a progressive scan blu ray player.",1327104000,4,3226,4.595486111111111

1777868,4,B00006IUFQ,"As others have said, this set of discs is as close as you can get to what aired on tv back then:
- original editing--no extra scenes, no nudity
- original film quality--has not been cleaned
- original audio quality--not stereo, original sound effects
- commercial breaks (but obviously no actual commercials)

- no special features--just the show and nothing more
- I don't honestly remember the original title credits, but these take scenes from all 3 acts (the remastered credits use scenes from whatever Act you're in)

Keep in mind, this is not the ""entire"" Robotech series--it's just the first Act, the 36 episode Macross Saga.  It is, however, all I remember from childhood and has a satisfactory ending and so personally, I had no reason to purchase the other two acts (what Americans know as the entire 3 Act ""Robotech Saga"" is actually a stitching together of 3 separate anime shows anyway).

Key differences with some of the newer, remastered versions: the remastered versions have cleaned the film making it look better than ever, but also added in a few new scenes (including some nudity).  The remastered versions have completely re-mixed audio which sounds fantastic and is in 5.1 surround--but they used many different sound effects so if you're used to the old sounds of guns firing, Veritechs veriteching, you may be annoyed.  Title credits on the remastered versions take scenes only from the Act you're watching and the text overlays look far better than the original 1980's quality overlays.  Finally, many of the newer versions have several extra features including interviews and audio commentary tracks.

Short version: if you want what you saw on TV as a kid in the 80's, this is the one to get.  If you want cleaner video and superior audio (but you're willing to sacrifice some editing and sound effects), consider the newer remastered versions like Robotech Remastered, The Protoculture Collection, or the to-be-released Robotech: The Complete Original Series (due out, Oct 18, 2011&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Complete-Original-Series/dp/B005DTGAQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech: The Complete Original Series</a>).",1315008000,6,2208,5.489675516224189

Sometimes things you loved as a kid aren't quite as good when you go back to see it as an adult.  It's not as awesome as you remembered it.

This isn't like that.  It's still super-awesome!

Granted, some of the dialogue is cheesy & soap-opera-ish.  That's part of the charm.  It's like Jackie Chan movies being a little cheesy (think 'Rumble in the Bronx'), it's part of the appeal.

The animation is way ahead of it's time.  It's freakin' fantastic.  The story/universe they've created is amazingly creative.

The first series is a tragedy.  There are parts that are depressing.  It's war.  It's not sugar coated. Characters that you've developed affinity for die.  The first series is the pinnacle, though all of them have something sweet to offer.

The second series is my next fav., with the third series being my least favorite.

The DVD collection has some cool extras as well, like a hour long movie that I believe never made it to TV.  In the timeline, it takes place immediately after the first series.

Besides the Shadow Chronicles which came out much, much later, there is nothing else Robotech offers.  This collection is the complete package.

The only omission is the 1986 film Robotech: The Movie which is unlikely to ever see a DVD release due to legal and technical issues with the original film negatives being damaged.

The only real downside to this collection is the packaging. The new versions of this collection have less discs (although containing all the same content as far I'm aware) and come packed in spindle cases where the discs rest directly on top of each other. These are HORRIBLE. The discs move freely and scuff against each other. I bought the collection new and several discs had circular scratches from rubbing against each other in the cases. I had to go out an purchase new 27mm cases with regular disc trays to replace them.

On the whole, this is still an awesome series.  The story is excellent and well constructed from the three original disparate shows.  Previously, when I was a child I hated the Masters series, but now I appreciate it.

The sound is ok... I didn't expect much and thus was not disappointed. On the 5.1 it is definitely better than other cartoons, but it doesn't seem to hold up well when blasting it super loud like for newer movies/shows.

But the visuals bothered me the most.  The colors are all very dark and not vivid, darker than other 80s toons that I have.  I tried it both on my bluray and older dvd player (and yes, I know this is NOT bluray, but usually my ps3 will make even standard dvds look fantastic).  There also was scenes where there's a lot of dotting (not sure of the technical term) -- it appears to be artifacts of the original production that never got ""remastered"" out.

However the line art is smooth and crisp so that almost redeems it.

That said, it is still a great buy for fans of the series and the extras are excellent as well. I've been dying to see the sentinels!!!",1295913600,3,1264,4.386266094420601
1777876,4,B00006IUFQ,"I'd just recieved this set and was extremely disapointed. I purchased this set as a packaging upgrade from the original release. This set from ADV no longer comes in a 22 disc format, they changed it to 18 disc.  It still has the same artbox and covers per season, but instead of the book type fold out plastic trays each season is a 27mm black spindle case.  The cases have styrofoam where an insert would normaly be. I'm guessing this is to keep the discs from coming off the spindle or moving. However 3 of the 4 boxes only have 4 dvds each and the padding does not keep them in place.  The Masters, New Generation and Extras discs all move freely on the spindles. The 6 disc Macross season is the only case where the discs are held in place. The artwork on the individual season cases is not reverseable.  I contacted rightstuf and they said that all of the new Robotech Protoculture Collections from Section 23 will be in stack pack form. So if you want the nice looking set pictured you're going to want an older used copy and good luck finding a decent copy.  If you do decide to go that route I'd be sure to get confirmation on the condition/version they are selling.  This was to be my ultimate Robotech Collection and since I already owned the series I kinda feel ripped off.  I'll be buying 4 new 27mm multi disc cases with trays to replace these cheap spindle cases. u.s. plastic has some nice 27mm M-lock dvd cases. I've purchased from them before. The cases there may cost more, but you get what you pay for and that's high quality. Cases are about 2 bucks each shipping will cost you 5 up to 13 cases. So if you looking for a cheap way to watch this series and don't care about packaging then this is the set for you. However if your like me and care about packaging you might want to factor in the cost to replace the four 27mm cases, before you purchase this set.

1777891,3,B00006IUFQ,"This series is, perhaps, one of the greatest pieces of nostalgia in my entire life.  To think of this series is to think of myself as an 11 year old boy, running home to catch the latest episode on TV.  Many have written about the various packages available, translations, etc.  This review will focus on the story and the animation.

To sum up:

Pros
 - Great larger story arc
 - A good story about the coming of age (physically and emotionally) of heroes (three of them)
 - When the animation was good, it was great
 - Really cool ships
 - Characters you really do care about

Cons
 - Animation used over and over and over...
 - Stilted dialogue
 - Some very annoying characters (Minmei, I'm looking in your direction)
 - Horrible music/singing
 - A thinned out story arc that doesn't seem to have an ending
 - A bad tie-in with other series
 - When the animation was bad, it was wretched
 - Love/romance shown in the worst way possible

At the time, this series was groundbreaking and certainly better than anything else on TV.  While the larger arc was not unheard of (see: Starblazers), it hadn't ever been done so ambitiously.  Tying it in with two other series (Southern Cross and Mospeada) was a very bad idea, and weakened the Macross arc here in America, but the Macross story still stood on its own for the most part.

My viewing of the series ended 10 minutes ago and to sum up the ending: what a downer.  The realization, after watching about 15 episodes, is that this is a soap opera.  Plain and simple.  The backdrop of war is perfect for such a thing, with death heightening emotions and such.  I was surprised when the great battle with the Zentraudi was so early in the show. The following episodes about rebuilding earth, dissatisfied Zentraudi, and Rick's ambivalent emotions toward Lisa are just depressing.  And it keeps going.  There is an attempt to keep it somewhat action-packed with Khyron's revenge, but the final third of the series was pretty hard to get through.  The constant sad music of the main theme played by an oboe starts to sound like a dirge.  A very, very long dirge.  Add to that the animation getting worse and worse and you begin to think the creators had only 26 episodes in mind, but they had to find some way to stretch it out to 36 episodes...with very little money.  Heartbreak on a ruined earth with the rotting shell of the SDF-1.  Fun!

I remember being able to spot those moments when animation was re-used, recycled and then re-used again (TWO ""remember when"" episodes!  TWO!!!) but there was even more of it than I remembered.

I still have the original Macross VHS somewhere when it was ""Ricky Yamata"" and the story had a little more push to it.  I'm sure, though, a lot is lost in the translation and with trying to tie it in to ""The Robotech Masters""...something I still don't really understand.

Minmei, while sort of cute in the beginning, never really ""grows up"".  And having her soon to be drunken, abusive, self-righteous cousin Kyle around just turns her into a sad co-dependent figure.  I'll be sure, when I show it to my 12 year old nephew, to tell him never date a girl like Minmei.  Lisa Hayes, the one Rick should REALLY want isn't much better, though.  Honestly, what self-respecting woman waits ALL DAY for a guy to show up for a date?  It does end happily...sort of...but there's no real finality to it in the American version because Rick and Lisa...take to the stars...?  Huh?

And the songs.  I think Harmony Gold only paid for about four songs to be written.  And they didn't pay much.  But they're going to make sure you hear them over and over and over...

But in terms of positives, this is still a great series (though not as great as I remembered).  It's worth seeing and there are moments that are truly thrilling.  The good supporting characters (Max, Ben, Roy Fokker, Miriya, Captain Gloval, and the deck crew) add a lot and move the story when they need to.

There is also an element which I still feel didn't talk down to us, the American audience, that dealt with the horrors of war.  Rick, as he gets promoted, loses some of his crew and he ""sees"" them along with ""big brother"" Roy and has a hard time dealing with their loss.  This may not be post-traumatic stress, but at least it's somewhat realistic.

So for those of you who are like me, who loved it and associate it with your childhood, my recommendation is this: rent it.  If you absolutely love it still, then buy it.  It's not really worth owning the whole series (especially the last ten episodes) and it hasn't really stood the test of time.  At the same time, that little kid in you will be very glad to see his old friends.",1280534400,2,4676,4.5041716328963055

1777893,5,B00006IUFQ,"Well, I just received my copy of ""Protoculture Collection"".  I was a bit skeptical, as I read the older reviews and the instances where there were complaints of how the surround sound overrode the vocals supposedly.  The only thing I can think of is that they have their surround systems are set incorrectly.  Yes, there is surround sound and it works exceedingly well(at least on my system).  It's not a Star Wars, but, honestly, I am hearing things all over the place!  It's fantastic what they have done with the original footage, especially considering the number of dics that are in the set.  I am not sure where to quite begin because there is soo much to say, so I will just briefly summarize.

Visuals: Stunning!  Definately dvd quality along with the sound to boot.  I have discs 2-5 of the original Macross series(which is what prompted me to begin looking for 1 and 6 that I thought I had previously purchased) and a few of the Next Generation discs, and the difference is night and day.  Much crisper graphics and fuller color.  There is also an extreme amount of less visual noise in the scenes that ""actually do"" show noise, which are very few so far(to give a contrast, it looks for the most part as good as DBZ).  They did a great job to say the least.

The new commercial cutaways are cool also; so far I have noticed one old and two new.  With the newer cutaways, they are a bit more graphic in nature(if you really wish to consider a battleoid shooting a gun graphic), but very cool.  There are some scenes where there is brief nudity as others have stated, but all that I have witnessed was on the dvd menu there was I believe Myria taking a shower.  Probably not something you would want a small child to see, but then again, there is actual killing and death in this series, so would I recommend it to a parent with a small child? Not even without the small amount of nudity.  But then again, most anime(such as Robotech) has a storyline that a kid probably isn't going to understand anyhow(just one adults opinion), but that does not at all detract from the series, as, like most anime's I have watched has some form of insignificant nudity or conflict/animated fighting.

It will take a while to get through the complete series and then I will go to the extras discs.  However, the series is very much worth the money.

1777897,4,B00006IUFQ,"Here's the thing: I was a kid when Robotech was introduced to the world.  I knew nothing of it's roots, Macross, Southern Cross, and Genesis Climber Mospeada.  It was a world without internet, without any sort of reference material to find out more.  Perhaps that was one reason why it was such a must from my kid days.  For when there isn't any way to get more than the one episode you saw that day, it leaves you wanting a ton more.

But nowadays I can research the net, find out that these anime shows I love came out in Japan years ago, and I can just watch them online and get way ahead of the United States therefore eliminating most of the expectant anticipation for what's going to happen on tomorrow's episode.  But that's me, getting off track.

So, Robotech.  I loved it, and still do.  Every song, every sound effect, and every voice talent that was a part of that show, I recognize immediately.  And now they've finally collected it in a neat package, and all three parts of it along with each of the extras discs that came with the original releases.  I had bought the original releases, and they were classically great.  Everything was as I remembered them.  Perfect.  But when I heard about the remastering, the missing scenes added in again, and the sound getting the fresher 5.1 surround fixes, I was ecstatic, and I ran out to get my copy.  But I learned a very good lesson from this action:

""What was old and classic, should never be changed in any way.""

The theme music background was the first red flag.  The music was there, but the classic animation to go along with it was gone.  Instead they inserted the original Macross opening, minus their awful music, thankfully.  While I understand this move, for possible new syndication, it still stung my inner child a bit.  But I moved on, just not very far.  The 5.1 sound is annoying as hell.  My classic sound effects, the ones I was soo used to I'd have them in my dreams, were gone and replaced by overly loud obnoxious repetitive noise.  There was no need to do this, and it only distracts from the overall production that once was.  And the sound effects only surround everything else in that when a character is talking, normally form the original sound, suddenly a plane flies by and pretty much demands your attention over the actual character's meaningful speech.

Other than that, the box is nice, the art on each set is gorgeous.  I love this show and had to have this collection, but the sound effects now cause me to have nightmares.  No, not really, but yeah, they will haunt my viewing of this show from now on.  Luckily I own the original sets.  But if you're new to Robotech, I'm sure you can overlook this problem, as you probably overlooked Jar Jar Binks because it was your first experience with Star Wars.  I'd say that's a tragedy, but you call it what you will.  Mee-sa go now.  Ugh.",1262822400,2,2879,4.485549132947977

1777942,3,B00006IUFQ,"Before you read the rest, let me give you my point of view: I'm not a huge anime fan. In fact, I'm not even a huge Macross fan. I watched the ""Robotech"" incarnation when it was on Cartoon Network's Toonami back in the day, and the series cut off just as Earth was about to be invaded. I bought this set because I really liked the few dozen episodes Toonami aired and really wanted to know how the series was resolved.

Now that you know where I am coming from (and maybe are in the same situation I was in), the best way to summarize the Protoculture collection as a whole is that it leaves way too many questions unanswered. The three series (yes, I realize that they were three separate shows merged into one series) are divided across three generations, and each transition leaves us with questions as to what the heck actually got resolved. The frustration mounts with each successive series, especially the final series, which I know anime purists love but just leaves me scratching my head.

I loved the Macross saga but was left hanging at the end and chalked it up to a dramatic open ending that left room for the SDF-3 mission saga (we see a preview of that in the extras but that's about it). The Southern Cross series was somewhat entertaining but choppy, with a more definitive ending but much less substance to it and an embarrassing amount of gratuitous nudity (poorly drawn nudity at that) that did nothing except bog down the action. Finally, I got to the final generation and tolerated with gritted teeth a meandering plot involving a cross-dressing singer and a lovesick 10-year-old only to have the most ambiguous, unsatisfying ending ever.

If you know and love all three series, you will love this collection, which has a lot of little extras for the true fan. But if you're like me and are only familiar with what originally aired on Cartoon Network, avoid this collection: we're not Robotech purists, and this collection is good for the pure but will just frustrate the casual fan.",1228780800,7,2004,4.623595505617978

I grew up in the 90's watching this show in Latin America. Of course, the show was in Spanish. Good news for those that speak it, something Amazon doesn't tell you is that this set contains Spanish audio 5.1 tracks for all episodes. Beware though, this is not the same dubbing that some of us came to love and cherish. Actually, the new dub kind of sucks compared to the old one, but my opinion may be biased toward the old dub. Also, the generic beginning intro for the series that we all remember has been replaced with three specific intros for each saga. That means that now there're three different intros for each saga instead of just one. Fortunately, they kept the same old song for all of them though.
I really don't understand why ADV would go through such great lengths to redub the series (redubbing has a high costs) and creating new intros for the series. When I bought the DVD I wanted to see that same old show I saw years ago.

***** (stars) For those who are new to the show or just don't care about the audio or the intro:

Well this is after all the complete series and this DVD package is loaded with extras (aprox. 450 minutes).",1214265600,2,1213,4.3584070796460175

Full surround sound (5.1, I think)
New sound effects; such as better gunfire and explosions and engine noises
Unedited for US audiences (several nude scenes, and a bit more bloody)
New opening sequence; a different one for each of the three sagas

The extras are fine; nothing amazing. But the heart of this set, and the reason to buy it, is to have all 86 or so episodes in one, relatively space-efficient box.

Even if the storyline is a bit dated - the SDF-1 crashes in 1999 and by 2011 or so the earth is destroyed (we still have time for that!), this series remains both a classic and still engaging.

The only thing I have to complain about is several plot and dialogue holes; sometimes things that happen or things that the characters say just don't make sense.

1778004,5,B00006IUFQ,"This collection covers the entire under-appreciated ""Robotech Masters"" saga following the adventures of Dana Sterling and the Earth Robotech Defense Force after the SDF-3 departs to the the world of the Robotech Masters.

Most of what made the original Macross great (great characterization, drama, action, and storyline) was present to a slightly less (albeit still satisfying) degree in Robotech Masters. A common complaint leveled against the series is that the characterization is ""poor"" and that only a relatively few characters (i.e Dana Sterling) have any depth. The only merit that I can find to this statement is that a few members of the 15th ATAC Squadron were not as fleshed out as other characters. This may be true in a sense, but this is looking at the glass half-empty instead of half-full. The larger cast of good guys in Robotech Masters meant that a smaller fraction (though not necessarily smaller number) of these good guys could be given screentime as major characters. In retrospect, even Macross had several ""underdeveloped"" characters. For instance, a full half of the members of the SDF-1 bridge (Vanessa Leeds, Sammie Porter, and Kim Young) are relative unknowns, with the viewer barely learning anything more about them than their basic military duties. Furthermore, exempting major characters, most of the Skull Squadron remain little more than anonymous wingmen throughout the series. Although Masters did have its fair share of lesser-detailed minor characters, there were more than enough interesting relationships in the fleshed out cast of ""good guys"" from Dana Sterling, Bowie Grant, Marie Christal, Nova Satori, Rolf Emerson, Sean Phillips, Commander Leonard, Zor Prime (and so on) to prove that the criticism about a ""lack of characterization"" in Masters is simply false. One just needs to cite Bowie Grant's internal battles between his military duty and his love of the piano, or his lovesickness for an ""enemy"" character, Rolf Emerson's constant battle of wills with Leonard, or Nova Satori's inner conflicts between following orders and friendship, to see just how incorrect such complaints are.

Similarly, the ""bad guys"" are also well-fleshed out. Unlike much of the third season, (and like Macross), the viewer is not only treated to the thoughts, motivations, and plans of the good guys, but with nearly every episode, we are given direct insight into the plans, thoughts, motivations, and fears of the enemy from both the standpoint of the military leaders and of the civilians. The enemy army doesn't come across as just big and bad random mecha patrols that serve little function other than to serve as antagonists to destroy at the end of every episode, but like the Zentraedi, several characters stand out as having considerable depth on par with some of the protagonists. Furthermore, inspite of the stern demeanor displayed by the main triumvirate of Robotech Masters, it was refreshing to see considerable screentime devoted just to their discussing of battle plans on how to best proceed against the Southern Cross. Seeing the Robotech Masters out-think Southern Cross was especially suspenseful, especially when only the viewer knew what trouble the unwitting good guys were getting into. All this was a nice contrast to the relatively little characterization given to the Invid in the first half of season three. With that said, it is this reviewer's opinion that the overall level of characterization in Masters actually exceeds that of New Gen (although less than Macross).

I also disagree on a common complaint that Robotech Masters had the worst mecha out of the 3 series.... Despite what may be said about the transforming hover tanks, to each his own, but I didn't think that Invid ""giant purple crab"" mecha was very original either. I'd much rather be caught in an AJAX or a Bio-roid anyday.

One thing that Masters had, that the other two didn't was that the bad guys actually WON sometimes! Robotech Masters wasn't scared to make the good guys lose every now and then. Up until the last few weeks of the war, the Armies of the Southern Cross had actually fared pretty badly in the larger battles. Aside from small skirmishes won by Dana's group, the Robotech Masters really proved their technological superiority, particularly in the larger space battles.

As for the purported picture/audio issues from some of the previous reviews, unless these problems have since been remedied, I found no such issues after watching most of Masters twice through. All in all, this was an enjoyable solid entry to the Robotech saga, and in this reviewer's opinion was the second best in the series (after Macross). To counter some of the unexpectedly low ratings, this reviewer gives this 5 stars instead of 4.4.",1199577600,,4764,5.134020618556701

Giant robots alone carry a lot of weight with me and Macross (the Japanese series that the first Robotech series lifts from) broke some major ground both in the US and Japan and the first series is certainly the strongest but it wasn't as phenomenal as I remembered it.

Southern Cross (adapted to chapter 2) and Mospeda (adapted to chapter 3) aren't held in particularly high regard by anime fans and as such are pretty weak as rehashed addons to a story that had a perfectly satisfying end.

Southern Cross in particular is pretty weak and even as a kid I considered it to be sloppy seconds compared to the other series. Even the giant robot designs are rather dull and uninspired and the action leaves much to be desired. I couldn't care less about the characters and the plot is forgettable.

Loved the design of Mospeda but the story occasionally had me bored to tears even though it had me totally enthralled as a teenager. In fact I think it may have been my favorite at the time.

Basically it comes down to this. If you can reread something like Dragonlance's Chronicles as an adult and not want to throw it against a wall, you're going to freaking love watching Robotech again especially given the sheer viewing hours you get for the price.

But as an adult gamer, anime watcher, and continued speculative fiction devotee, my tastes have grown and I'm pretty much over it. Now if somebody could finally manage to make a truly awesome Robotech GAME, that would be exciting.",1189209600,8,1671,4.705479452054795

Now they finally came out on DVD. And this is a great collection. Has the Macross, The Masters and New Generation series all on DVD, remastered. The picture quality is clear, the colors vibrant and the sound is much better and sounds great on surround sound speakers.

It even came with the Sentinels movie, added footage, deleted scenes, art gallery pictures, interviews with Carl Macek and others. If your a real Robotech fan, you can't go wrong by buying this collection, I wasn't disappointed at all.",1188777600,2,682,4.536585365853658

1778024,5,B00006IUFQ,"This is what I grew up with (remastered!): Robotech & Transformers were *extremely* popular in the mid-80s. Really, anything featuring transforming robots at the time became a hot commodity, but these 2 properties were easily the best & most popular circa 1986.

...This is the set I currently recommend. Having said that...
-Visuals: Imperfect remastering, but I like it. Decent cleaning up of the grainy picture, with much less visual artifacts & aging. The blue colors seem to be a little too intense at times. Some colors are slightly altered.  I manually brighten the screen for better enjoyment. Having watched both this & the unremastered, I think I far prefer this new look. But I wish someone would remaster this again, because I really think it's possible to improve on this current release.

-Sound: Imperfect 5.1 remastering, but it's bearable. The sound effects can be loud, LOUD, L-O-U-D- while sometimes the voices are too soft in comparison. Some sound effects have been changed. I still prefer these remastered discs though, mainly for the visuals.

-Extras: ALL the extras from the legacy editions are included here. I like the legacy editions too, but they're overly expensive to say the least. Most people will want to skip the legacy editions and go straight to this most recent edition- The Protoculture Collection.

There are 3 main Robotech sets currently available:

1.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Macross-Saga-Complete-Collection/dp/B00006IUFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech - The Macross Saga - Complete Collection</a>. 6 discs- 36 episodes- no extras. It's the cheapest in price & quality; it's exactly what aired in the 80s. Picture quality here is somewhat poor but bearable. The sound isn't 5.1 like the remastered versions. 80s-style episode intros feature scenes from all 3 Robotech storylines. I *only* recommend buying this set if you're on an exceedingly tight budget or you're buying this for kids. There's no nudity (unlike the remastered versions).

2.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Macross-Saga-Legacy-Collection-1/dp/B00005BJEF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech - The Macross Saga - Legacy Collection 1</a>. Released in many sets- Expensive considering it's exactly the same as above, with the additions being somewhat OK extras and upgraded, attractive packaging. Currently the ultimate 80s collection- meaning all the 80s imperfections are included: grainy picture with visual artifacts & aging. While I prefer these Legacy editions to the set mentioned above, most people will probably feel the ""extras"" aren't worth the extra price. I only recommend this to die-hard fans & collectors. There's also no nudity (unlike the remastered versions).

3. Robotech - Protoculture Collection. As already mentioned- This is the set I currently recommend. Digitally remastered extended editions; english & spanish 5.1; 14 discs with 85 episodes plus 7 discs of extra features. All 3 storylines are included (Macross, Masters, New Generation). Episode intros have been reworked: no more splicing together of the 3 storylines like in the 80s. Each intro is focused on the series it came from now. The only potential drawbacks here are the somewhat expensive price, somewhat imperfect remastering, and the addition of extended scenes featuring brief nudity (female undressing & shower scenes). I'm actually okay with these scenes, but some parents may not want this collection for their kids.

Whichever version you choose, I highly recommend this excellent series to anyone & everyone interested!",1186272000,21,3652,5.823970037453184
1778025,5,B00006IUFQ,"Well Robotech fans this is as good as it gets.  With the image cleaned up and the soundtrack remixed, what else could you want?  I could ask for one more thing, ""Robotech the Untold Story"".  For those of you who do not know of this is was ""Megazone 23 part 1"" retooled to bridge the gap between the first and second series.  Good or bad I would have loved to have seen it, esp. as an extra included in this edition.  I feel that this is the most complete version that will ever be offered, unlike the 500 versions of Star Wars.  This collection could not do any better.  If they do, I'm happy with what I've got.  It was worth the wait.  I think you will agree.",1186185600,,661,4.1015625

Some may complain that it strays too far away from the original verson but have seeing and owning both,the remastered verson looks and sounds WAY better!

Reccomended to all robotech fans though if you are looking for the originals as they aired on tv look for the other AVD dvd collections instead.",1184889600,,468,4.650602409638554
1778027,5,B00006IUFQ,"When I first saw this as a kid, I was amazed.  Here was this cartoon that was telling a story like a great movie.  The world was in the fight for its life, everything revolving around a ruined alien battle fortress restored.  I was a huge sci fan, and this series played perfectly into it.  After Tom&Jerry, and Woody Woodpecker and the other inane cartoons from my youth, Robotech was like a delivery from outer space itself.  I recently got the original Japanese version, to see how it was seen in Japan.  I hate to say it, but the music pales in comparison to the Harmony Gold US production.  The composer, something Italian, deserves a ton of credit.  As for the Japanese versions, I wouldn't advise them to anyone.

Anyway, this collection is great, but I also got the grainy original dvd's, just for nostalgic's sake.  I actually think the graininess makes the animation look better.  Having fuzzy lines is better visually than the solid lines in the remastered stuff, I think.",1184457600,,983,4.656976744186046

Es cierto que la traducci&oacute;n al espa&ntilde;ol no es la original de la TV pero esta muy bien lograda y casi no se puede notar este cambio ya que las voces en algunos casos son muy parecidas y en otros quiz&aacute;s mejores.

Lo estupendo es poder tener la edici&oacute;n remasterizada y extendida, que nos permite mirar esas cosas que consideraron censurables en un primer tiempo y con una excelente calidad Visual y audible.

No te dejes persuadir por los que opinan mal de este paquete porque solo lo hacen pensando en detalles casi sin importancia como la entrada y cierre que es nuevo (pero muy bien acabada y mantiene su esencia) o el doblaje no original de la vimos por televisi&oacute;n al espa&ntilde;ol, estos detalles son de importancia menor si consideramos que lo que nos interesa en verdad  es poder mirar de nuevo esta serie animada y revivir la magia de su esencia que nos cautivo hace mas de 20 a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s.

1778029,4,B00006IUFQ,"C. S. Lewis said, ""When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty, I read them openly. When I became a man, I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.""

This fits me perfectly.  I saw the anime back in the 80's, not only fell in love, but was also converted to the power of art.  As usual, in the process of time I moved on and moved up in the world.  On lark, I got these DVDs for Christmas.

What a surprise! I relived and more importantly re-experienced what I felt as a teenager.  Of course there are flaws, sometimes having to do with the nature of anime, the nature of animation, and also the contorted history of the franchise. (""Big Brother"" and ""Little Brother"" should be ""Pops"" and ""Squirt""; the classic ""Old Sourpuss"" should be ""Old Battleaxe"")  Yet, it is a good series.  As the Bard said, ""Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.""

So, to the product:

MACROSS: (TV-14)

This is the heart and soul of Robotech, and the best overall of the three.  The theme of ""relationships within the framework of war"" leads me to call this ""War and Peace 1999.""  There are mentoring relationships, inter-species relationships, and the weird love polygon of Minmei-Rick-Lisa-Karl-Lisa-Kyle-Minmei.

Favorite episodes are #11, the ""I'd rather do it with you"" kiss, #21, Max and Miriya playing the video game, and #35, The plastered Lisa Hayes singing ""Miss Macross.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ROBOTECH-20th-Anniversary-Soundtrack/dp/B000EDWIOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ROBOTECH:  20th Anniversary Soundtrack</a>

ROBOTECH II (Extras disc 3). This short focuses on Maj. Gen Hunter and Fleet Admiral Hayes.  The animation was done by a different company, so the designs mirror ""Battle of the Planets.""

SOUTHERN CROSS: (TV-MA)

This series is energetic, but a bit choppy--pay close attention to the narrative which compensates for compressing the information.  However, I think this is the weakest of the three series. We see a lot of Dana (sometimes too much), but the other members of the 15 ATACs seldom rise above shadow-puppets.  Louis is the brains, Angelo is the antagonist, Leonard is Dolza, jr. The only person with personality is Sean Philips.  He was Dana's superior, but when he is busted to buck private, he holds no grudges.

Although this has the weakest characterizations, it  paradoxically, has the central character in the saga, Zor.  All of the events of every anime, film, novel, and aborted project revolve around what he did by discovering Protoculture and robbing the Invid of the flower of life are due to this atlas.  Sadly, we see so little of the majestic side of this man. As McKinney wrote ""Just what the Robotech Masters had planned for Zor Prime after he'd let them to the Protoculture matrix is, and forever shall be, open to speculation.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Masters-Saga-The-Southern-Cross-Robotech/dp/0345391845/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech: The Masters Saga: The Southern Cross (Robotech)</a>

The AHEM scenes with Dana explain my TV-MA rating.  I'm puzzled over their inclusion.  Aside from titillation, they serve no purpose.  These scenes are obviously forced, silly, and, from an editor's point of view, not only useless, but a drag on the action.  By confusing D(i)ana, the chaste huntress, with the love-goddess Venus, they ignore the sharp-fanged lesson that Diana's hounds taught peeping-tom Acteon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metamorphoses-Penguin-Classics/dp/014044789X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metamorphoses (Penguin Classics)</a>

If this is being ""puritan,"" remember that the root of puritan is ""pure.""  We should demand that our art be pure in the same way that we demand our food be pure, since art is food for the soul.

ROBOTECH: THE MOVIE (Extras disc 5)  Inasmuch as this product is supposed to be the be-all, end-all of Robotech, should have been included. We just get the trailer and character sheets. What a gyp.

NEXT GENERATION: (TV-14)

Overall, this is my favorite of the three.  It has a killer (pun intended) beginning. Like Southern Cross, this has stronger individual episodes, and also handles the ensemble cast better than the other two series.  They devote full episodes to the backgrounds of the various charters.  In fact, many of the episodes remind me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible-The-Complete-First-TV-Season/dp/B000HWZ4HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season</a>&nbsp;with each person having a small part to play in the overall events.

The stand-alone episodes are like the old, old TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ark-II-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000IU37UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ark II: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Mountains/dp/0689856725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Mountains</a>, about a fellowship going around writing wrongs and riding off into the sunset.

The best episode is 65, ""Curtain Call.""  In fact, if I wanted to convert anyone to Robotech, I'd show them this one.

You also need to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Shadow-Chronicles-Movie/dp/B000KWZ1UM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech - The Shadow Chronicles Movie</a>. It is not a stand-alone movie, but Episode 86.

Personally, I enjoy the novels, and there is a crying need to republish all 21 in seven 3-in-1 omnibi.

PARENTAL ADVISORY:  This is not the ""edited for television"" version.  Episodes 4, 33, 38, 39, 43, 46, 48, 51, 72, 73, 80) all have about 5-second female AHEM scenes.  The Southern Cross has so many, I rate it a TV-MA.  Billed as ""the special extended version,"" there is nothing special about the reintegrated AHEM scenes, and they are certainly over-extending our patience.  Moreover, scenes that do not convey distinct information are not advancing the plot. Remember the slime massage from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Enterprise-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0007TKH66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season</a>?

I am not bothered by the number of releases like others, but in this case, I am deeply disappointed with the huge change to the series: the credits. Originally, the 3 series' openings and closings were edited together quite nicely-timed well with the music. In this case, the openings feature footage only from the current generation (macross, southern cross, new generation). BAD. And the titles, the credits are annoying. They blur and scale in and out. They tried to keep everything in motion, but instead it is bothersome. The moving text with the highly animated backdrop does not work well at all. And lastly, the outside box art is pretty good with Rick and Scott, but the inner art is scarce and unexciting. Otherwise, the show looks and sounds great.

1778065,5,B00006IUFQ,"I remember the sheer depth of this program.  Say what you will about it being a ""bastardization"" of all its source material (an argument I'd agree with, looking at the ""Masters"" part of the saga), Macek and his merry crew kept as much of the emotional ""oomph"" of the Japanese originals as he could.  I truly loved ""Robotech"" and consider it - as well as ""Star Blazers""/""Ushu Senkan Yamato"" - as the reasons for why I like anime as much as I do.  Now we have the complete run, all cleaned up and retooled for the die-hard purists like me.  What I mean by this is that they reinserted as much of the footage they clipped out as possible, giving the dyed-in-the-wool fan as close a look at the original Japanese as possible, while maintaining the whole ""protoculture"" angle written in by necessity.

Yes, it'd be nice to have the original cuts as well, but the restoration was much needed.  To see the color-corrected restored episodes is a treat beyond measure, and with all the original voice-actor glory.  I know of yet another sequel that's coming down the pike, and there have been replacements in favor of celebrity, but I hope they maintain the integrity that Carl Macek, Tommy Yune (yeah, I know HE'S working on the sequel), et. al. put into bringing back ""Robotech"" as it should be.

I won't retread the storyline, but fans of the original will love it, and it's also a way for the next gen of anime fans to see a good example of storytelling over arcane references to other media items noone else will get.  Not fair, true, and it sounds like more of my ""old man"" grousing, but you really can't compare this and the other ""old school"" series - even the ""giant robot type - to what passes for anime these days.  Really, what would you rather watch as someone just starting to look for good story and deep material - mysterious ""card/video game"" references and editing or something with just a good plot, well told, which also has some of the best character designers (Haruhiko Mikimoto) bringing the folks to life?

The extras, well, they're a trove of great additional material not used in the shows, as well as tantalising glimpses of what might have (or should've) been.  Including old pilots that were attempts to bring anime to the masses 20-odd years ahead of the current boom, we get to see all things Robotech, all bundled up with a bit of the new and exciting.

Anyone who hasn't purchased any of the previous collections would be well verses, if they can, to spend the money for this one.  An arm-breaker in heft, but priceless in bringing back old memories.",1169164800,9,2574,4.579520697167756
1778066,4,B00006IUFQ,"It's an excelente purchase, but I expected more from the remasterization, still it's an awesome adquisition and I've only seen 1 saga.",1168992000,,134,5.136363636363637
1778067,4,B00006IUFQ,"Most of the criticisms of this set are valid, but that doesn't make it not worth buying. As for those who tell you to wait until the real ""ultimate"" collection comes out, never mind that. If you looked at how long it took them to get the series out in the first place, never mind remastered and extended, you'll be waiting quite a while. Besides which, no edition can be ""ultimate"" until they're finished with the series, and if the new movie coming out is halfway successful, that may not be for a while.

To return to the merits of the set itself, with this one set you get the remastered, extended versions together that were previously available only in separate sets (thus gaining the ire of some hard-core fans who bought one or the other, or both). There are a lot of extras, including The Sentinels, that you might not have gotten a chance to see. However, not all of the extras are worth having, such as the old toy commercials that show little boys running around playing with the Veritechs. The ""Women of Robotech"" commercials are definitely worth watching once, just to see how bad they are. I was laughing plenty hard at those.

The sound and picture quality is better than you can expect from a show created over 20 years ago in analog media. But you can't really compare it to a modern anime or movie. It wasn't recorded in 5.1, so all the 5.1 really does is take the existing 2-channel sound and expand it. That's alright if you want loud and bass, but just to listen it's about the same on either a 5.1 surround-sound system or a simple 2-channel stereo system. As another reviewer noted, the picture quality was indeed grainy when it was first on tv. They've done an admirable job cleaning it up, although a few scratches and flakes are obvious here and there. But again, it was made 20 years ago and it looks like it. If you haven't ever watched Robotech and are thinking it's of some quality like Fullmetal Alchemist, no. It's just not going to be that good.

Also, if you're expecting to get exactly the original sound effect, caveat emptor. As others have pointed out, they have made some slight changes that aren't, in many buyers' opinions, better, or even slightly worse. Why did they change the credits, both graphics and soundwise? It didn't improve the series. They also altered the commercial break graphics. I don't care about any of that and I didn't spend the money to watch credits or commercial breaks either. That leads into one of my main complaints about this series: there is no play all option, and you see the ""cards"" for the commercial breaks every time! This is not to say that you can't skip from the end of one episode to the beginning of the next because you can, it's just that you always start at the beginning of the credits, not the next episode. Now I have seen this done on plenty of dvds such as Scrubs, but on Robotech you can skip again to the beginning of the episode, so they're not trying to force you to watch the credits. And if they're not trying to do that, I'd rather just have it keep rolling from episode to episode. But that's not a major problem, just a very minor inconvenience.

Amazon is offering it at a truly remarkable price for the amount you're getting. It's a dang 20-disc set! I say, even if you already bought one of the other sets, go pawn it for whatever you can get and then pay the extra for this. It's worth it. Robotech isn't a series you watch for the animation (or music). It's just a good story with some characters you can really like (or not).

1778070,5,B00006IUFQ,"Robotech is by far the most complete anime I've ever seen. Yes, the animation itself wasn't so impressive, but the synchronization between the American voice overs and Japanese mouths actually go together well.

the main plot is not anything new, but it's well told and amazingly threaded together.  (especially considering this is a translated piece, from the original Japanese series, Macross Mosepeda).  If any young writers or movie-script writers want to learn about how to make plots and subplots work--this is the anime show to see!

the characters are moving, and they actually grow, unlike many cartoons and or anime.  I mean, the main hero, Rick Hunter was a brash 19 year old from the beginning of the series; and turned into a serious, take-charge ace pilot when he turned older.  IT was believable and incredibly well thought out.  The range of emotions from each charater (even the minor ones) make you believe they are fully human beings.  The voice acting projects it to the point where it enhances their movements and emotions already.

The action, of course, is intense, and creative.  Every scene you would wish to replay and pause just to see how many ships were blown up, or what's the ""score"" count of the invariable human and Zentrani aces.

The typical romance plot, however sickening to watch as a kid, was convicing and deeply sad.  I felt most sorry for Minmei, but I am glad Lisa Hayes found someone to love her.

The best thing about Robotech is, the music.  Each scene, chacter literally had its own score.  Each alien had its own theme, Carl Macek and the music director got it right--whenever someone sits down to WATCH something, the MUSIC has to be as intense as the show itself.  (that's why Star Wars, and Indiana Jones will always be remembered too).

The down side of course, is that the plot of the ""robotechnology"" and ""Flowers of Life"" could have been explained further in detail and with more ease.

But, besides that, it's well worth the money and as a kid in the 80s brings back a lot of memories.

I wish I could give this a 10 star rating.",1160697600,8,2085,4.694214876033058

1778087,5,B00006IUFQ,"When Robotech burst onto the American TV scene in the early 1980s, everyone was stunned. This was a wonderfully serious dramatic story, an epic saga about a war spanning generations. People fought, people died--bad decisions had consequences. And the story actually continued from episode to episode, rather than each one being a different story--for children's TV, that was unheard-of!

Of course, we all know now that it was really assembled from three entirely unrelated anime series, but that still doesn't change what Carl Macek accomplished. He created a sweeping story greater than the sum of its parts, a story that we Robotech fans can still enjoy today.

I have not yet seen this series in its entirety, having as I do only the first set of remastered DVDs that are included within this one. However, from watching those episodes, I can say that the sound and video quality is nothing short of amazing. If you have a 5.1 speaker system, you are going to want to use this set as a demonstrator; during the battle sequences, the explosions occur all around you. When the SDF-1 zooms low overhead in the first part of the first episode, you feel like you should duck and cover.

Of course, the remastering isn't without its niggling little annoyances. The opening credits are changed from the credits we remember and love, focusing more on footage from the particular series that you're watching. Some of the new sound effects or the new sound mix are not as good as the ones we remember from our youth. But for all of that, this is still the best that Robotech has ever looked and sounded. Plus, for the first time ever, it now comes bundled with the seven extras DVDs from the Legacy Collection, which include things like The Sentinels, the Codename: Robotech feature movie, and more other stuff than you can shake a stick at.

I do feel the pain of those people who are upset at ADV's ""double-dipping,"" especially given that ADV originally said that a remastered Robotech would be impossible to make, but there is a reason for it. At the time they made that claim, they honestly had no expectation of ever being able to find the original audio elements that they would need to put a new version together. As far as they knew, everything had been destroyed in a flood. However, a year or so later those old elements were discovered and restored after all, and Harmony Gold and ADV felt that fans would probably rather have a remastered version than not.

Despite what others have said, I feel this is likely to be THE penultimate Robotech collection; I just can't think of anything else they can do to the show that they have not already done. Remastered audio and video, check. Extras DVDs, check. Bundle them together, check. That's it, they're done.

There simply isn't any way they could include the original source material on the same discs as Robotech. This isn't a simple matter of a show being redubbed ""straight,"" where they could slap the original voice track onto the same footage. Robotech was edited in large and small ways (especially the Southern Cross segment, which had episodes chopped up and reassembled (including one episode put together entirely from scratch) and the order switched around), so the footage simply does not correspond to the original audio any longer. And there's not room to put those on the same discs as Robotech. In order to put the original shows in, they'd have to include them separately, as was done on the abortive ""Perfect Edition"" VHS series a while back--and in order to do that they'd have to add still more discs to the set. And why bother? You could go ahead and buy the original sets separately and be just as well-off.

If you've been lucky or prudent enough to hold off on purchasing a Robotech set until now, this is the one you might as well get.",1135036800,119,3814,4.709145427286357

1778090,5,B00006IUFQ,"Robotech is simply one of the original and best animes to be imported from Japan to the States in the mid-80s.  With an amazing storyline, enthralling characters, and a great musical score to go with it.  While it is one of the best animes to come out in the 80s, the animation appears to be pretty dated by today's standard.  It is, after all, over 20 years old now.  But even so, it stands up fairly well.

For those new to Robotech, here's a brief history:  Robotech is actually a compilation of three completely separate Japanese cartoons mashed together and marketed in the U.S. as three separate generations.

Here's a brief history of the different packages that Robotech has come out on, so you know your options:
- First came the ""Legacy Collection"", Robotech was released ith a 3-DVD package, 2 of the DVDs contained 6 episodes each, and the 3rd DVD was an ""extras DVD.  There were 7 of these sets at $40 each (all prices from Amazon, of course).
- Second, they repackaged the above by removing the extra DVDs, thus creating the ""Complete Collection.""  These were split by generations.  The Macross Saga = 1st Gen ($63), Robotech Masters = 2nd Gen ($40), New Generation = 3rd Generation ($35).
- Then came the ""Remastered"" DVDs, which was supposed to contain extras and better sound and video quality at the cost of $26 per set, 7 sets total (Sets 1-3 = 1st Gen, 4-5 = 2nd Gen, 6-7 = 3rd Gen).

And finally, we now have this particular DVD edition, which is the complete ""Remastered"" collection with all three generations combined.

I have to say Harmony Gold's really pissing me off with the way they sold the DVDs.  First, they come out with the ""original"" 3-DVD packs with an extra DVD packaged for every 2 6-episode DVDs.  Then they package these original DVDs together by generation.  THEN, they announce ""Remastered"" DVDs only a year or so later which includes supposedly improved sounds and video quality.  I personally don't know because I didn't bother spending another couple $100s buying the Remastered version after spending as much on the original.  Personally, I also mostly enjoyed the First Generation and thus would only get the DVD for that, so this package with all three Generations is not of much value to me.

If you've never watched Robotech before, I'd recommend just buying the First Generation on DVD.  If the 1st Generation isn't to your liking, you probably won't like the other two.
If you like that, then get the 2nd and then the 3rd Generation.  Of course, given that the complete cost of this package is only $20 more than just buying the 1st Generation set, it might make sense to just buy this box set.  Personally, I own the original ""Legacy Collection"" DVDs and don't plan on ""upgrading"" to these DVDs.  If I was to by any more Robotech-related DVDs, I would actually buy the ""Macross Set"", which contains the original Japanese cartoon Macross that Robotech is based off of.  At least there, I'd feel like I'm paying for something that's worth my money rather than DVDs that I already own, but somehow repackaged.

Although Robotech is great and all, I don't see much value in buying these again since I already own the original DVDs.  The 5-stars is obviously for the Robotech Series and not for this package.",1130803200,23,3256,4.690140845070423

1778116,2,B00006IUFQ,"To begin let me tell you something about Robotech: Robotech was created by taking three Anime that were not in any way related (Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada) and creating a single series - Robotech - from them. This is because back then there was a minimum length for shows to be aired on US-TV and Macross was too short...

As you can imagine continuity is not easy to be achieved in such a project... You could drive several battletanks through the plot holes

Southern Cross (here called ""The Masters"") does not reach the quality of Macross by a long shot. Even disregarding the fact, that the editors were faced with the difficult task of fitting the series after the storyline of Macross, the show is quite cheap. Battles are uninspired and frequently footage is used two or three times during a single combat leading to repetitions. (If you've seen the same bioroids explode for the fourth time you'll know what I mean...) Tranformations of the good guy's mecha are done just to look cool (and it doesn't). There is no tactical reason whatsoever to change configuration three times, all the while fighting the same enemies in the same environment (Actually I found myself hoping the bad guys would exploit such stupidity and pop some of them.)

The characters are pale and only Dana Sterling (Her name was changed to imply she is the daughter of two characters from Macross, though that girl had green hair, while SC-Dana is a typical blonde.) gets any amount of screentime at all until into the second half of the series.

The second half surprisingly gets a little better with less copied scenes and more time for secondary characters, saving the series a two-star-rating from me.

As to the differences between the original Southern Cross and Robotech - The Masters (Don't worry I include no major spoilers):

First of all, for those of you that were wondering why earth is looking a little strange, SC is not set on the earth but on a colony world named Glory. (By the way, Glory had two suns, all shots that show both at once were edited or taken out of the show.) This explains why there are almost no battleships on the planet itself and all of them ""return from deep space"" (i.e. reinforcements from earth^^)

In SC Zor is just what the others believe him to be - a brainwashed human soldier.

And finally, what happens in the end is really a good thing in SC! I guess they cut all the cheering out to make it seem like a catastrophe^^

Definitely not a Must-See-Show...",1092700800,14,2517,4.663656884875847

As you can imagine continuity is not easy to be achieved in such a project...

Macross is a classic. Sure the animation is old (well, so is the show^^) but the battle scenes are still superb and nicely planned out and executed. Unlike in SC transformations are done when they make sense e.g. when battle shifts from space to the inside of a ship or to a planet surface. The story has some nice plot twists, the characters are given much time to develop and form bonds with each other and come the end you will have come to like almost every single one of them! Granted Minmei's constant whining grated on my nerves a bit and add to that the fact that her voice actress CANNOT SING, I didn't like her very much. (I was constantly cheering Lisa on^^) I'm told the original VA can sing a lot better...
The last few episodes could have been shortened somewhat, one or two were pure filler (Why you put filler at the end of an otherwise perfectly paced series is beyond me...)
I also cannot fathom why they invented a newly built SDF-2 for the plot. From the footage it is quite clear that this ship never existed in the original show and as it is destroyed without ever even lifting off, where's the sense?
Macross is in my opinion by far the highlight of the Robotech collection. I would go so far as to advise you to simply ignore the second season. Or even better: Get yourself the original version of the show, if you can afford it (See review of Kintari) without any references to ""protoculture"" and the like. (There is no protoculture in the original show.) Sadly Macross: SDF is very expensive... Maybe you get lucky to pick it up at ebay cheaper...
So with Macross you will get a great series badly mauled by extreme editing. Ignoring all the modifications will be hard but after a while I had the parts that didn't belong identified. Macross would be close to five stars if it were not for the changes in the story and Minmei's singing voice (That girl is supposed to be a pop-star for pete's sake!)

One thing that is slightly surprising is how well they've held up in my memory, which is a testament to how well written the series is and well executed each episode.
Picture quality is not important to me and I refuse to penalize a ground-breaking mid-80s anime for 'unsophisticated' animation or whatever.  The animation is as thrilling now as it was then, but what's most important, the story is truly excellent.  Excellent characterizations, excellent story development: the Zentraedi, the Veritech fighters, the SDF-1, are all introduced slowly and there was real care given to raising tension and building a universe.  I admit I find the very same things annoying that I did so long ago: Minmei is very annoying, for example, and Lisa somewhat stuffy (though my 8-year old self had a crush on her), and some cheesy/ditzy moments.
But my excitement at finding this series on sale has been mightily met.  This was a cartoon series that rose above what it had to be.  It matches its epic scope with clear characterizations, including a surprisingly mature love triangle.  Not to mention cool fighters and cool fights.

But I must say this, Macross and the New Gen. have great story lines while the Masters falls somewhat short of greatness.
Dana Sterling is the main Character, buring the whole things she show little in leadership skills and acts more like a child. Though in the books it's differenet ( hard to find but worth the trouble of getting) I find myself comparing the show to the books, while the Macross show and book runs very well as one the Masters is isn't. Dana in the books is more of a leader with a Rebal edage. Then a kid with a hoovertank.
I really want to list the problems with this dvd,
1. Characters are block and dull nothing really great about them
2. The Saga has more battles and talking about battles than anything else which makes it dull (but atleast they are good fights)
3. To much inforamtion is put on the viewer and sometimes viewer has to watch an ep. a few times to get it all.
4. In Macross and New. Gen alot of human emoations are put into the show to get the viewer to really get into the show, but the Masters has so little that is dry and fells almost bland.
All though the show has it problems it is still key to the Robotech Saga anyway you look at it. It answers questions about Robotech, about the Masters and yes even the awful and hated Invid. It also answer that bigest question people ask when they first geting to the Macross Saga.
""What Happiend to Rick, and Lisa and the others?""

Being a fan of the series as a kid, I decided to buy the whole Robotech: Macross series, but I came across the overwelming amount of editions to the series.  I didn't know which to buy, so I watched them all.  Here are the differences between to different boxsets (all offered through Amazon):
Robotech: the Complete Macross Series
One Boxset: 6 disc
Sells for around $60-$65
Nothing special, picture quality is not great, but bearable.  Comes in one compact boxset with all the disc in it.  Would not reccomend getting this edition unless you just want a copy of the series and want to spend the least possible amount of money.
Robotech: The Legacy Collection: Macross Saga (Collections 1-3)
Three Boxsets: with 3 disc in each
Sells for around $40 each boxset, entire set around $120-$130
Same picture quality as the above set, but with addtional features.  Comes with the most extras out of any current sets, but even then, they are so-so.  I would actually recommend getting the above edition as I was not impressed with the extras, some were interesting, but it definately didn't justify the price.  Your paying almost twice the price.
Robotech Remastered: The Macross Saga (Volumes 1-3)
Three Boxsets: Two disc each boxset
Sells for around $25 each boxset, entire set around $75-$80
Remastered picture quality superior to both sets above, sound quality much improved.  This is the set that I would recommend.  The price is affordable and well worth the extra money compared to the first set.  Also includes a few bonus footage.
Macross: Super Dimensional Fortress (Sets 1-3)
Three Boxsets: Three discs each boxset
Sells for around $60-$70 each boxset, entire series around $180-200
Macross is the original Japanese series of the Robotech: Macross Saga.  The storyline is slightly different with different music and sounds.  When it was brought to the US, Harmony Gold added the Macross material with two other Japanese series to make Robotech.  Macross is more ""mature"" and includes several scenes taken out of Robotech.  Picture quality is even more crisp than the Remastered Series.  I would reccomend only to die-hard Robotech fans.  It's pretty expensive and lacks really any real extra features.",1086825600,225,2347,4.992287917737789
1778133,5,B00006IUFQ,"LA TRILOGIA DE ROBOTECH, COMIENZA CON LA SAGA DE MACROSS, EL PRIMER CAPITULO. ESTE DVD CUENTA CON TODOS EPISODIOS DE LA PRIMERA SAGA. DEJANDO AL ESPECTADOR CON GANAS DE MAS ROBOTECH. EN PARTICULAR PARA MI, ESTA ES LA MEJOR SAGA DE LAS 3. (ROBOTECH LOS MAESTROS) Y EL ULTIMO (ROBOTECH LA ULTIMA GENERACION).

CONSIDERO QUE ROBOTECH QUEDARA EN LA HISTORIA COMO UNO DE LOS MEJORES TITULOS DEL ANIME. ESPERANDO SIEMPRE ALGUNA VERSION DE HOLLYWOOD EN DONDE SE APRECIE UNA SERIE COMO ESTA CON LOS GRANDES EFECTOS ESPECIALES QUE HOY TENEMOS.
AUNQUE ESTE DVD NO TIENE LEYENDAS EN ESPAOL NI DOBLE AUDIO.. ESTE TITULO DEBE ESTAR EN LA VIDEOTECA DE CADA AMANTE DEL ANIME.",1086652800,2,838,4.7465753424657535
1778134,5,B00006IUFQ,"I love this series - I remember bolting home from school to watch it. Here in Australia it was rarely aired after that first screening in '85 '86, and I pretty much forgot about it until I read on the net they were releasing it on DVD.
Needless to say I bought all three boxed sets straight away!
The quality and sound is pretty much excatly how it was originally with lets admit it, some really dodgey animation, but as an 8 year old I didn't really notice. Now, although I still love this series I wish they would reanimate the whole thing, keeping the story exactly as it was but with todays animation.
But for the moment I am absolutely content to chill out with Rick, Lisa, Menmei, Dana and Scott Bernard. Great Stuff.",1074124800,,723,4.362962962962963
1778135,4,B00006IUFQ,"Like its predecessors Speed Racer, Battle of the Planets and Starblazers, Robotech's contribution to generating a fan base for anime in America is inmeasurable.  Even considered on its own merits, it is a great space opera that still stands the test of time.  Without it, anime would not have evolved into what it is today.
This is why we can't fairly compare the superior series of today(such as Neon Genesis Evangelion) to Robotech on an equal basis; one preceded the other by over 10 years (even though NGE is better both in storyline and art).  Robotech is classic Japanese animation and should be viewed as such.",1051833600,3,617,4.80188679245283
1778136,5,B00006IUFQ,"As a kid, I didn't tune in to Robotech until the second episode of the Masters.  As a result, I didn't see Macross until I was a bit older.  That said, it was the Masters chapter that hooked me on Robotech, and I'd highly reccomend these DVDs to anyone who enjoyed Macross or The Next Generation.",1048377600,8,296,4.267857142857143
1778137,5,B00006IUFQ,"The quality of this DVD set is very good. You have to keep in mind that Robotech was made in the mid 1980's. One reviewer went as far as to say that his recorded VHS tapes from 86 had better quality than this DVD set. My recorded VHS tapes from early 1998 when it was on cartoon network have much poorer quality than that of the DVD set. He couldn't possibly have been bieng honest because his tapes are 12 years older than mine.
I bought this set expecting it to have poor quality and sound, but i really wanted all the episodes. I bought it and to my delight it was WAY better than some people made it out to be. Maybe people don't understand that this is from 85 and animation quality from that era isn't very impressive. It looks exactly like it did when it was created.",1047340800,14,774,4.166666666666667

1778139,5,B00006IUFQ,"I am a big Robotech fan.  i like it very much,and this part 2 is the best part in robotech i think. although haven't so many heroes, but it is so profound and has so much complexity of characters just like Dana,Zor,also Robotech Masters. this part is the core of Robotech, it is mysterious, solemn and stirring. it make me to see that the real meaning of Robotch is not only anti-war, but the forever principle between universe and being. only this part can show that. if you can't understand this part, you can't understand the whole Robotech.",1044921600,,544,4.551020408163265

1778151,4,B00006IUFQ,"Ok if you like robotech then this is a must have, you get a 6 dvd boxed set with the first 36 episodes in english, the quality is about the same as when it was on tv in the 80's, pretty good but not excellent, thats why i only give it 4 stars out of 5, still this is a good deal.",1042761600,3,279,3.5161290322580645
1778152,3,B00006IUFQ,"I must be the only reviewer who noticed how awful the video quality and sound were.
I think this DVD set was mastered from some old VHS tapes that were laying in a box in someone's closet.
In contrast, the Transformers DVDs I bought have very nice, richly saturated video and sound.",1041379200,,282,4.4423076923076925
1778153,3,B00006IUFQ,"Obviously, a lot of these reviews are fueled by nostalgia.  Anyone who says this show looks great is fooling themselves.  Being from the 1980s and not having been remastered at all, it looks pretty terrible.  Even if they had cleaned up the transfer, which they didn't, it would still look bad in comparison to today's animation because of its age.  The art is simplistic at best, and there were a LOT of shortcuts taken in the animation (still frames show up a lot).  Then there's the Americanization--new intros, endings, and commercial breaks were thrown together from existing footage, with new text typed over them.  These look especially bad, with the text all pixelated and the footage even grainier than the show.  The music also leaves much to be desired, mostly because of the time it was made in and the fact that it is a cartoon.  Think ""Superfriends"" and ""Scooby Doo"" and you're pretty much right on.
But, don't go thinking it's all bad, because it's not.  The underlying story is actually pretty good.  The voice acting is also decent for the most part, and many of the actors who got their start with Robotech have gone on to do a lot of famous voice work, even still working today.  Another good thing is that even when it was originally aired, the content was not edited as heavily as some of the more modern anime shows are.  Dragonball Z has a lot of the violence and language removed, for example, to the point where major plot points are lost.  Robotech, while edited creatively by Carl Macek, takes a much more mature approach and realizes that sometimes in war, people do die.
With so many disks available in this one package for such a relatively low price, this is really the only way to get it.",1041292800,4,1720,4.6
1778154,3,B00006IUFQ,"While the Robotech story is original, full of action, and human emotion; the second act was lacking many of the things that made the first one so irresistable.  There is no hint of intelligence until well towards the end of the story and it only makes the involvement of the famous ""protoculture"" all the more confusing.  Despite these problems, I did enjoy this era in the robotech story, but it sure didn't have the feel of a real military background that I found so appealing in its first act.",1040601600,9,496,4.561797752808989
1778155,5,B00006IUFQ,"I think one thing most of these reviewers neglected to mention is that this is an extremely well-written narrative.  It's kind of ""Stanley Kubrik meets Voltron"".
This is a lot more than your usual anime ""Evil demon must be slain"" and it's certainly not cartoon demon porn.  This is a bona-fide epic.  One that most Westerners will find much more satisfying and palatable than the artsy high-stylization of something like Vampire Hunter D.
In addition to some KILLER battle scenes that have never been matched in any cartoon since (you literally cannot comprehend the number of projectiles and combatants that are moving in some of these sequences), this show dealt with the issues of war, comraderie, death, rebirth, love, humanity and sacrifice in a complex and textured way.  How many cartoons have you seen where they show the entire earth getting wiped out from ground level?  Picture this:  a little girl innocently talking to a smiling policeman a split second before they (and the entire population of the earth)are vaporized by a Zentradi weapon of mass destruction RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES.  Can you say, ""Nipponese grappling with culture defined by two atomic blasts""? I can't think of a cinematic treatment of nuclear war more horrifying than that.
Let me say it one more time:  IT HAS A GOOD PLOT.  YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED EVEN AS A SOCIALLY-FUNCTIONAL ADULT.
If you were a fan of Starblazers or G-Force when you were a kid, then this is the masterpiece of that genre you've been waiting for.",1040256000,9,1507,4.85546875
1778156,5,B00006IUFQ,"It's like one a heck of a flashback to the 80's.  Seeing Rick Hunter, Lisa Hayes, Lynn Min-may, Max & Miria...shoot, Even Captain Gloval was cool to see again...It's just like I remembered it every day after school except this time I don't have to wait untill the next day for the continuatuation.  The color has definately improved.  It also sound's awesome on surround sound.  If your a Robotech Fan..heck, if you're just an Anime Fan this is definately one for the collection and a must have for Robotech fans!  I'd rate it right along with Akira or Vampire Hunter D..it's just that good!",1039392000,2,591,4.644230769230769
1778157,1,B00006IUFQ,I cannot express the disappointment I felt viewing this DVD set. When Robotech first came out I rushed home furiously from school to watch it and then later on automatically record it when I bought a VCR. The story is all there and the dialogue but the main thing that is missing is Image quality. At first I thought I had a bad disk set or broken DVD player. This to my horror was not the case. My friend had just bought it also and I asked him about the image quality. I can't tell you what he said in this review for fear of offending. Needless to say he did not like it. I stuck in a VHS tape from 1986 of the old series and sure enough it even looked better then the DVD set. The DVD set is highly compressed and pixilated with film flaws and all plainly and easily seen. I looked at the back of the DVD set box and saw clear and crisp images shown from the series. One thing is for sure the manufacturers of this disc set didn't get their art from the discs they are selling. That much is clear. Frankly they should be ashamed of themselves. This is clearly a case of false advertising and delivering a defective product to the consumer. Bottom line here is do not get this disc set. If you're even expecting an ok picture then you will be disappointed.,1038182400,22,1259,4.163934426229508
1778158,5,B00006IUFQ,"When people think of classic anime, they often think of the old space-opera epics that pioneered the now huge Mecha genre. And when you think of the Mecha clasics there are two series which very often come to mind. One of them was the first what would become known as the Gundam Legacy, the original Mobile Suit Gundam. The other is what was to become the first part of what we Americans call Robotech. THE MACROSS SAGA.
What is the Macross Saga? It is many things. It is the story of race of giant warriors from another part of the universe who attack earth in order to get back their missing super-space-fortress. It's the story of that ship and her crew who must continually fight a war with this alien race merely to survive. And it's the story of Rick Hunter, who does for this series what Christopher Blair did for Wing Commander. He's just an ordinary guy put in extraordinary circumstances, surrounded by a bunch of stange characters, and forced repeatedly to become a hero in a war that he knows is pointless.
Some of the episodes are great, some of them aren't so great. And the show definitely lags a bit toward the end. But the battles are spectacular, the music is classic, and most of the voice acting is memorable (it's not Shakespeare, but I'm not complaining). The singing...well it was fine the first hundred times I heard ""To be in love"", but after that...sometimes you just wish they had left in the japanese singing, it couldn't have possibly been worse than this.
Anyways, this series features some truly memorable moments, some nicely stylized animation, and a darn cool plot. It gets to be a little too soap-opera style at times, but if you're a die-hard anime fan you're used ot that by now. The music is great, the singing is not. And if you start to get bored toward the end, have patience. Every great Saga has a showdown, and this one delivers in spades.
In conclusion, every anime-fan should own this Saga. It's fun, it's entertaining and it's a classic by anyone's standards. And of course the reason why I started watching the show on dvd in the first place was: it's a really great price for anime on dvd, especially at six episodes to a dvd!",1037836800,3,2175,4.551020408163265
