Mortadelo and Filemon is a series known to most Spanish kids, as popular there as Mafalda for Argentineans or Superheroes for Americans. This movie is GREAT and a lot of fun, not only for me, who grew up reading their comics, but also for other kids (and adults) whom I have shown the film. Highly recommended, you will have a lot of fun. I hope a Region 1 DVD comes soon...",1281052800,,424,4.182926829268292
