1340932,2,B00004I9NR,"There are so many bad reasons to see films that seeing CaboBlanco simply because it has one of Jerry Goldsmith's most obscure scores doesn't seem quite such a stupid one, especially since the score is pretty good. Although it never matches its magnificent Ravelesque opening, let alone the extraordinary work Goldsmith was doing at the same period (Star Trek, The Boys From Brazil, The First Great Train Robbery, Magic, The Swarm, Masada, Poltergeist), it's another case of a composer being inspired by a bad film to turn out a good score that's still head and shoulders over 99% of film scoring today.

The film itself is certainly an oddity, an attempt to do a Casablanca in post-war Peru, but Charles Bronson, Dominique Sanda, Simon MacCorkindale, Fernando Rey and Jason Robards were never likely to offer much competition to Bogie, Bergman, Heinreid, Rains and Veidt even had the script been better. (There's no Dooley Wilson or As Time Goes By, but Nat King Cole is playing on the jukebox singing The Very Thought of You.) Sanda in particular, as usual in her English language work, is so staggeringly awful you half-expect her to bump into the furniture, although she gets strong competition from MacCorkindale in the who-can-give-the-worse-performance stakes, but an easygoing Bronson at least is good value.

Feeling more like one of RKO's mid 50s SuperScope South of the Border treasure hunt movies than anything from Warner Bros.' golden age, the film at times feels like its suffered some last-minute editing, jumping into some scenes apparently midway while some characters are never introduced properly (prominently billed Clifton James never appears at all), and the ending - involving a parrot, a secret code, a stuck record on a jukebox and a cyanide pill - is one of the most absurd endings in screen history. Still, there's some fluid and impressively composed camerawork and the scenery's nice, although both suffer in the DVD transfer here. It's an unlikely candidate for restoration, but it's worth noting that the German DVD available through Amazon.de does at least boast a good 2.35:1 transfer and extras (trailer, 25-minute making of and hardback book style packaging), though the soundtrack doesn't fare so well.",1287619200,3,2238,5.1287671232876715
1340933,5,B00004I9NR,"OK, I REALLY like Charles Bronson - that said, this is a REALLY good movie - I saw this on TV many years ago and never forgot it - took me many years to find it on DVD - some people get hung up on scenery, acting talent (or lack of it!), or comparisons to other movies - I totally go for the STORY - this particular one has a surprise ending that blew me away - I love it when the good guys prevail - there are so many excellent Bronson movies, I suppose this one has been forgotten about - I've seen many lists that don't include it - this has nowhere near the violence of the Death Wish series, etc., but you will be rooting for him immediately, just like always!",1224288000,5,665,3.970149253731343
7920448,3,B00004I9NR,"Caboblanco is a typical example of one of Bronson's European movies of the late 70' and early 80's. Always taciturn and rugged, Bronson rose to fame by virtue of his muscular build and screen presence. This movie is slow paced and doesn't have much to recommend it. Bronson was capable of better work, when he had a good script and better material, but in this one he's sleepwalking through the role. If you're looking for vintage Bronson, try Hard Times or Death Wish.",1497312000,,469,4.662650602409639
7920449,4,B00004I9NR,"Interesting Bronson movie. He showed here that he still could play a romantic lead in his late 50's. Amazingly, due to what someone told me were problems at Columbia, this film hardly got a release. I remember waiting in 1980 for it to come to a theater near you, and it never came. Only some 6 years later did the film come out. A little ridiculous at times, especially the \the climax at the end. But the film does have irony in the end. Also the music from 'The VERY Thought of You plays to much. the difficulties that the film had in getting released may also be attributed to Bronson's declining star power at the time, which I think would come somewhat back in the 80's with his Cannon years, though many of them were really inferior films. He would do a lot of films with J Lee Thompson, but this would I feel be the best. Interesting to note, that there were many scenes cut from this movie, and it seems that those scenes which were shown in some countries might be lost. Perhaps another reissue with those scenes intact would be interesting, or even stills.",1496620800,,1067,4.393939393939394

7920451,4,B00004I9NR,"You don't watch Bronson for depth of acting, you watch his persona deal with difficult situations with action.  This one takes a few aspects from Casablanca--but only peripherally.  One of several films he made with director J. Lee Thompson.  Probably only for Bronson fans, although there is a good cast--including Jason Robards, Fernando Rey (Charnier from French Connection I & II) and Gilbert Roland.",1484524800,,404,5.28125

7920454,3,B00004I9NR,"A lazy laid back murder mystery involving Nazis in South America, with Bronson doing his best acting. Dominique Sanda is nice but too tight lipped for me.  Jason Robards is pretty good, but the great American, Bronson, steals the movie because he doesn't take it seriously.",1480636800,,273,4.934782608695652
