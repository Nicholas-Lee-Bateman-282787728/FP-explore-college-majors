4851590,5,B005OA4Y76,"The Wiggles were the center of my kid's universe for a while. He loved anything they did. They could have coughed and he would have wanted it on DVD. My son started walking at 7 months and was very unbalanced.  I had a bright idea that watching the Wiggles would help with is coordination. It worked. Although this DVD has more advanced dancing moves than the earlier one's my kids still loved the singing and dancing.  And yes parents it is just a phase, eventually your kid will move on.",1365033600,,489,4.4222222222222225
4851591,3,B005OA4Y76,My two year old loves the Wiggles. This video is no exception; he will watch it over and over again. I can tolerate plenty of kid programs including the regular Wiggles show but I thought this DVD was extremely odd and dated.

All of the segments come directly from the Wiggle and Learn show, but they are artfully arranged, and the DVD includes some great extras. It's a winner for the whole family (my husband and I enjoy watching this too). You can't really go wrong buying this for your child if he/she loves the Wiggles - or even if your child just loves music/moving, in general. Watching this always makes us feel like dancing, and it's sure to do the same for your family!",1359763200,17,1354,4.429718875502008

4851596,5,B005OA4Y76,"We bought it first from a toy store in Feb just that it was on sale and was the last one on the shelf. My three-year-old loved it and watched it at least two times a day. I then took it with us to Asia to visit my family and other kids in my family, and grandmother all liked it for the good mix of music of  different times and great dances for kids to follow. Grandma loves the ballroom dancing part. I left my DVD in Asia for my family to enjoy and bought the second one from Amazon as my kid and even my husband miss this DVD so much. We shall keep this DVD for our grandchildren to enjoy in future!",1353024000,,603,3.8629032258064515

4851622,3,B005OA4Y76,"Wiggles You Make Me Feel Like Dancing is not only the best of The Wiggles six American albums, it's the apex of heavy-metal art: the first LP sinceLed Zeppelin IIthat captures all the blood, sweat and arrogance of the genre. In other words, this DVDkicks like a mutha.

Much of the credit must go to Sam's successor, Greg, a savage screamer who combines the breast-beating machismo of Led Zep's Robert Plant, the operatic howl of Ian Gillan (ex-Deep Purple) and the tubercular rasp of Slade's Noddy Holder into singular, nerveracking, Tarzan-type shouts. True, Sam probably has to yell this way just to be heard above the deafening instrumental thunder of guitarists Murray and Jeff, but the singer offers style, too. He sands off some of his rough edges for some of the songs here a surprisingly commercial romp with an intoxicating sing-along chorus, and even boasts a little Memphis soul in the groin-grinding ""Let Me Put My Love into You"" (though the results here sound more like Steve Marriott imitating Otis Redding than they do Stax-Volt).

The Wiggles are responsible for most of the musical mayhem, hammering out one Herculean riff after another on the rhythm-section anvil of bassist Jeff and drummer Murray. While Sam anchors such songs as ""Shake a Leg"" (a dead ringer, by the way, for Led Zeppelin's ""Living Loving Maid"") with his hamfisted, almost percussive rhythm-guitar playing, Murray runs riotously up and down the neck of his axe, peeling off banzai solos that are the studio equivalents of his notorious schoolboy tantrums onstage. Since less is often more in The Wiggles' warlike world, the only luxury the group allows itself is a clean, invigorating production job by Robert John Lange.

Unfortunately, a lot of people can't recognize the talent because of the noise. The Wiggles may not be everybody's cup of joy, but they're not rock & roll's village idiots either. They've simply utilized many of the elements found in the early Rolling Stones' sound  catchy hooks and riffs, a Greek chorus of guitars, a singer who does everything butsing and cranked them up to plutonium-strength power. More than any recent record,The Wiggles You Make Me Feel Like Dancingseparates the heavy-metal men from the metallic meatheads.",1423526400,,2242,5.051351351351351

This is a fun, dance-along sing-along video.",1380499200,3,401,4.826086956521739
4851637,4,B005OA4Y76,"When Greg left he must have got the iron as part of his severance package because this has one of the greatest Wiggles songs ever, The Shimmy Shake, and one that will find the last nerve you have left in your body and make it want to poke its ears out, The Mooch. I can understand that the words to Minnie the Moocher aren't very Wiggly but they could have had the Hidey Hidey Hidey Ho part instead of cat noises. Maybe Sam can't scat sing.

The Shimmy Shake transcends children's music and should be shared around the world. Written by Anthony's brothers from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-The-Cockroaches/dp/B006M6W6QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of The Cockroaches</a>&nbsp;it could have been one of their songs just as much as it could have been a Mod era song. Although a bit uneven this is one of the better Sam era DVDs, the colors of the computer background are really bright and I wonder if Sam was allergic to sets or something. The Wiggles have more costume changes than usual, the sailor, disco, and Beatle suits from their stage shows start here, and there's those Greek outfits. Anthony's aversion to shoes is in full swing.

If your kids are big on fairies, angels, or anything with wings you'll want to have a pair at hand for the Fairy Dance. Dorothy fans will want their tutus or formal ball gowns as well. The Mooch has jazz cats and there's a couple of sailor numbers. All the dances are easy enough to do but the instructions for the Bus Stop go on a bit long for anyone with Anthony's attention span.",1373587200,,1587,4.874074074074074
