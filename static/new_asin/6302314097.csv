454113,5,6302314097,"My recollections of this movie are from memory. The part that I remember most vividly is John Lithgow killing Jessie Ventura in his own prison cell with his bare hands.
I did buy this video and will write more when I watch it again.",1027123200,3,232,4.295454545454546
454114,5,6302314097,"This is a brilliantly scripted and acted action-suspense-thriller. Some scenes are extra-violent, with one prison guard having his torso carved in half with a power tool during a break-out; in another scene, the chief  villain is sent flying off a tower and ends up pinned like a beetle on a  pole. The first half is undoubtedly the best, with its tense and absorbing  psychological battle between Earl Blake (John Lithgow) and Nick Styles  (Denzel Washington) the smart, wise-cracking cop who put him away, and who  then turns succesful District Attorney. It is Styles's success that Blake  venomously grudges and so he hatches an elaborate and devious plan from out  of prison to destroy Styles. The second half of the film is characterised  by implausibility and anti-climax. But on the whole, the dialogue is above  the average and the action has a hard-trimmed, gritty quality about it.",958435200,28,891,5.0479452054794525
454115,4,6302314097,"I first saw this movie just 2 years ago. I had already seen Pulp fiction, Dead man, Straw dogs, Reservoir dogs and A Clockwork Orange. The hype about there violence was always over the top and I was never shocked, but  Ricochet I had heard no hype for, and I was Plenty Shocked, which was a  very new sensation. The film is great, but I don't think its the sort you'd  want to watch over and over. Denzel is great, as usual.",943574400,5,424,4.146341463414634

454159,5,6302314097,'Old' Denzel movie when he had just started his ascension to Hollywood superstar...a lot of fantasy going on in it (Ice T allowing his own stash to be destroyed by Denzel) but it was still fun and entertaining and showed an African American in a 'positive' light which wasn't seen a lot 25 years ago!,1496620800,,300,4.472727272727273

454267,5,6302314097,Ricochet is an outstanding thriller that has been treated like absolute crap on home video for some reason and its unforgivable. It`s one of Denzel Washington`s best movies. John Lithgow is incredible as the villain. This guy needs to play more villains. Ricochet is very exciting and entertaining. I have no idea why its treated the way it had been. The dvd is one of the most terrible dvds ever produced and there`s no HD transfer available at all.

Denzel Washington as always does a very good job as a fallible character, even though he seems to play a cop a lot. John Lithgow plays the vengeful villian who DW captured some years ago. The case's description gives a little too much away, and JL's antics are sometimes rather ridiculous but they work. Director Russell Mulcahy of Highlander and the Shadow does a good job with a movie that's somewhat out of his genre. For John Lithgow and Denzel Washington movie fans alone, it's worth a look.

454453,4,6302314097,"Seriously, a still shot of Denzel Washington in uniform was used by his LAPD officer character in ""Training Day"".  Otherwise, that and the city of L.A. and the LAPD are the only connections to the later film.  Personally, I'm just fine with that.  This film occasionally gets a bit goofy and comical, but it stands up quite well on it's own.  My only real problem in regard to its plot is when Denzel Washington's character strips down in order to get the gun with which he takes down John Lithgow's character...seriously, I could have done without that entire scene.  But it got the story moving, so I'll let it go.  John Lithgow was perfectly creepy and self-serving throughout the film (it's very important to aknowledge that second trait), making him a man I so dearly wanted to take down myself.  Denzel Washington countered him with a man who knows his morals and principles but has to contend with everyone else's growing doubts about these atributes of his and he gets perfectly more and more frustrated as the movie goes on.  Perhaps my favorite performance was that of Ice-T...I'm just so used to seeing him as Finn on Law and Order:  SVU that it was nice to see him doing something besides that and doing it well, though his organization of the press and cops at the end was kind of goofy.  Again, I'll let that go.  If you're like me and you can let the minor silliness go, then this is a decent cat-and-mouse chase to watch.  Enjoy.",1395878400,3,1445,4.558139534883721

Just watched it last night and I have to say that while the movie was just as good as I remembered it, the video quality on this DVD leaves something to be desired.  They claim it's Widescreen/Letterboxed, but I seriously believe that it's more like 4:3 Letterboxed.  It seemed like the top and bottom of the screen were badly chopped just to give it the letterboxed look.  We were NOT happy about that but watched it through to the end anyway.  As I said before, the movie itself was just as good as I remembered it, although I'd forgotten how truly evil John Lithgow was in this.  Exceptional actor who was later made out to be idiotic in 3rd Rock.  Excellent performances all around in this suspense thriller rollercoaster ride.

Not sure why, but just could not get into the movie.  The script did not seem very original and kind of bored me throughout the movie.  Maybe because the picture quality on the dvd from early 90's was so poor that it made the movie look too old.  Try to see it on one of the high-def HBO or Cinemax channels but otherwise if you skip seeing it don't think your missing much.

454493,4,6302314097,"This moviecould be described as Cape Fear In The Ghetto - Jon Lithgow matching Robert Mitchum in the powerhouse acting department, though taking it over the top for Friday night movie crowd.
Lithgow is a crafty thug who somehow becomes fodder for Washington's ""15 minutes of fame"". DW is a recent Law School graduate with a view towards making a career in Law enforcement. D.A. Lindsay Wagner sees the amateur video of Washington saving a hostage's life *and* saving the life of the perpetrator, so he can be brought to justice with no extra gunplay.
Jon escapes from prison, reunites with his Arian Nation buddies, and sets out to do to Denzel what Denzel did to him - take apart his life, piece by piece.
There is an abundance of witty dialogue and barbs at the media, which by 1991 had already joined the junk culture, with sensationalism where fairness and accuracy once prevailed.

454497,4,6302314097,"This is a typical Denzel Washington film: well-acted, rough language, a racial theme and an involved story that holds your interest. A lot of his movies fit those categories.

Washington plays a preacher's kid and its nice to see he has such respect for him. So many times, Hollywood portrays fathers and especially clergymen in a bad light. John Lithgow is the villain and is such a crazy over-the-top loon he's fun to watch. There are no lulls in this story, yet the action scenes weren't overdone.

It gets predictable in the end but I like the analogy in the film to the classic movie, ""White Heat."" I was sorry to see a few things: once again, white people are all the bigots; Lindsay Wagner, television's nice lady of the past, now using very profane language here and looking hard.

Overall, this sometimes looks like a ""B"" action film more than a classy one but it's still an interesting crime film that sports a few different angles. It may not be one of Washington's better-known efforts (less than 20 reviews here), but it is still entertaining.",1239926400,,1056,4.666666666666667
454528,5,6302314097,"I don't know what other people were expecting. This was supposed to be a popcorn flick not a movie made to win oscars. The story is simple enough
Denzel Washington plays Nick Styles, a cop/attorney who busts a psychopath named Earl Talbot Blake(John Lithgow) at a drug ring gone sour.  Earl Blake plots his revenge on Nick Styles in jail and escapes from prison. From then on, he systematically destroys Nick Styles life and has everyone questioning Nick's sanity.

The storyline is not bad and Denzel does a great job as usual. John Lithgow is perfect as Earl Blake and its probably his best role since the scared flight attendant in Twilight Zone: The Movie. His villain is a throwback in the days when villains were villains and not these craven new age geeks who tap on laptops and run from confrontation as far away as possible. Kevin Pollak is decent enough as Nick's partner Harry. Ice-T plays Odessa(and who the hell names a man Odessa?), the man who helps Nick Styles take down Blake. If you are looking for Oscar material you are definitely in the wrong place but if you are looking for a pretty good thriller it wouldnt hurt if you tried this.",1225065600,2,1154,4.597087378640777

Washington starts off the movie as a beat cop who runs across criminal Lithgow and apprehends him. Next, we flash forward years later where Washington is the DA, having made his career off of the Lithgow bust. And Lithgow escapes from prison, and is ready for revenge...

Everyone performs well, even though you have to believe they realized how silly the movie is, but you are able to go with the flow and suspend disbelief enough to enjoy the proceedings. This is just a fun action flick. No need to make it any more than what it is.",1175558400,7,747,4.782945736434108

454533,4,6302314097,"I can remember the first time I saw this movie. It was on HBO right after the George Foreman vs. Lou Savarese fight a few years back. Being a film with Denzel Washington and John Lithgow, I was surprised that I hadn't heard of it before then but was in for a big surprise.
Being a 1991 film (and an HBO Original Production), this was made before Denzel Washington really hit it big but it's one of his finest films in my opinion. While Washington portays a young cop turned bright futured district attorney, the best job in the film is done by John Lithgow, who plays one of the best psychotic yet genius characters in recent memory (Earl Talbot Blake). Lithgow, in fact, does such a good job playing this insane yet calculating killer hell bent on revenge that it's very strange to turn around and watch him on 3rd Rock From The Sun!
The supporting characters played by Ice-T and Kevin Pollak are well done and well written, but also very important in the storyline...something that isn't always true in mainstream films.
The plot is very interesting, and not something that has been 'done to death'. As the film winds down, it seems a little predictable but also the only suitable way for everything to end. Ok, so it's not a blockbuster 4 star masterpiece, but RICOCHET is still a very well written film that is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.

I like the basketball game in the beginning of the movie..where you see Denzel slam dunk the basketball!! ""HE GOT GAME"" - thats for sure!
  The character Denzel portrays in this movie is a mixture of his ...training day character and the character he played in Out of Time.  He is a victim, but yet he knows how to mess with bad guys. Great movie...ICE-T did ok..this was during the time period Mr. Ice-T was doing films such as New Jack City and Trespass.....Solid performances....and a pretty decent story line.  If you want to sit home one day and drink a beer and watch a suspenseful movie....this is it.

454535,1,6302314097,"(spoilers, but don't worry; you'll never want to watch it anyway)
Every few years or so, I come across a movie that seriously contends for the title of ""worst movie ever made.""  Godzilla was one of them, then 200 cigarettes, tomb raider... Anyhow, if it weren't for the respectable effort made by Denzel Washington, this movie just might take the cake..
Denzel plays a cop-turned-DA and Lithgow is a psycopathic hitman who has an obsession with breaking out of prison and getting his revenge on the man who put him away.
Nothing here seems to make any sense.  For example, the sword fight at the beginning between Blake (John Lithgow) and his cellmate -- first of all, Blake already established his dominance as soon as he entered the jail cell and beat up his new roommate.  This bizarre neo-medeival sequence, using books and newspaper as armor, has no point at all.  It's just a excuse to showcase some really bad dialogue.
And as for really bad dialogue, Ricochet is unequalled.  I cringed at least once every two minutes.  Lithgow is so ridiculously serious in his role that anything he says sounds like it's a mockery of himself.  It reminds me of the head gangster in the movie Ghost Dog, except in that movie it's *supposed* to be ridiculous.  Who knows - maybe that was the idea here.
The end is totally gratuitous.  The plan that Denzel comes up with is completely foolish for one thing - if his plan were to fail, which would almost certainly happen, he would end up completely ruining himself.  But in the movie, it doesn't fail.  Ok, fine.  But then, when he has Blake surrounded and could easily have him captured, or at least video-taped to prove that he's still alive (oh yeah, Blake made a preposterous escape at the beginning of the movie and then faked his death), he draws the charade on longer and has Blake chase him down to the Watts Towers.. (The fact that the towers are used  is the only cool thing about this movie besides Denzel..)  It just seems like he's making things as difficult as possible for himself.  He comes off like an idiot.
A good mainstream suspense movie should have a very intellegent protaganist and a slightly more intellegent antaganist; the only reason the protaganist should ever win is because of his absolute commitment to survival and justice, not because the antaganist is easily tricked into silly little scenarios, like being electricuted on Watts Towers (would those towers really conduct that much electricity??)

""Ricochet"" had Dezel W, pretty much the sole reason I picked up this movie. And it started with a bang, literally, followed by some superb action right down to the middle of the film.
Yet, midway through the whole charade I just forgot to care about all the gory violence, not in the least due to its implausibility. Some scenes with Lithgow's terrifying cameo as the bad guy are even quite menacing and impactful. But at the end one only leaves with a taste of crassy action from cardboard characters in a staid plot.
