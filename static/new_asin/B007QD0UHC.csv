8521032,5,B007QD0UHC,"Allhumdallah great film. We don't see that many good Muslim films showing Muslims and Islam in a positive light, so this was really a treat.",1382313600,2,140,4.64
8521033,5,B007QD0UHC,Very good animation with Hollywood standards. We need more animations like this. Thanks to Fine Media and its sponsors. These films need to be advertised.,1379548800,3,154,5.2
8521034,5,B007QD0UHC,Short film but very good and nicely done. My daughter really enjoyed the movie. She gives it five stars for a movie.,1355702400,2,116,4.318181818181818
8521035,5,B007QD0UHC,"Beyond my expectation! Every house must have it! My family love to watch it again and again. I know the story of Salman, but this movie brought me to tears...",1353024000,2,158,4.3
8521036,2,B007QD0UHC,"The description listed on Amazon is misleading. It seems to be confusing two different people: Salman the Persian, who was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH); and the Prophet Solomon, who was a king of the Israelites. The subtitle on the box art looks correct from what I can tell. I haven't been able to watch the video yet. Hopefully the content is correct, and the only issue is the Amazon description.",1343433600,6,413,4.671232876712328
