2542213,5,B000EWBKO4,"This is a great collection of Alf cartoons; funny, silly, and a little weird.  The environments and characters are very alien and still familiar enough to get you to identify with the humor.  There is some slapstick reminiscent of the old ""Loony Toons"" cartoons with a little ""Three Stooges"" thrown in.  THIS IS DEFINATELY ""KID SAFE"", and fun for parents to watch too.  My favorite episode is ""Hair Today, Bald Tomorrow"" where ALF is enchanted with a hair growing/removal version of the Midas touch.

BE WARNED, the whimsical opening theme song is extremely catchy and will stick in your head like gum in your hair!",1264809600,4,615,4.819047619047619
2542214,5,B000EWBKO4,The Alf cartoons were as good as the sitcom it spun off from and this is a wonderful thing to have on dvd. Alf as usual is great fun for the whole family,1220745600,2,153,3.6666666666666665
2542215,4,B000EWBKO4,"When I was young the fall season meant two things besides falling leaves and carving pumpkins. It heralded the start of the school year and a new season of Saturday morning cartoons. I could hardly wait for the premier of the new fall lineup but year after year I found myself disappointed. We kids were fed a steady diet of low quality programming like Teen Wolf, The Snorks and Kissyfur. Then, in 1987 something magical happened. Starting at 10:00 AM children were presented with a solid hour and a half of creative, well produced programming including Pee-Wee's Playhouse, Ralph Bakshi's Mighty Mouse and Alf: The Animated Series. In a cruel twist of fate, the second season of Alf was pitted against another high quality cartoon, Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters on ABC as well as the second season of Pee Wee on CBS. In the end Alf usually won my attention until reruns started and then I switched to the Ghostbusters or Pee Wee. This was probably the peak of Saturday morning cartooning as far as I was concerned.

After more than 20 years Alf: TAS still holds up. I was surprised at how well I remembered details of episodes, right down to specific lines of dialog. The animation is organic, energetic and colorful and the writing is top notch for its day. It definitely has a late 80's feel to it but the creators really went all out to produce a fully realized Melmac (home planet of Alf). The supporting characters are great and Alf: TAS manages to do something so rare in cartoons. It's actually legitimately funny. What I can't deny is that the animated series has pretty much dropped from the public consciousness. It only survived two seasons (which is one more than most Saturday morning cartoons) before being completely revamped as the lamentable Alf Tales and then cancellation.

In rating DVD's I tend to weigh almost all my calculations on the feature presentation with little to none on the quality of the packaging, transfer or special features but I have to say that '20,000 Years in Driving School' is the bare bones minimum. No special features whatsoever, only nine episodes chosen randomly from the full 26 and some rather mediocre transfers. My understanding is that Lions Gate released this cheapie collection to test the market interest which turned out to be lackluster. It's too bad because Alf is a terrific cartoon. If this is the best I can get I'll have to live with it but I for one would rush to get all 26 episodes if they ever become available and hopefully they'll pull together some better transfers. When it gets right down to it the DVD is priced low and if it helps Lions Gate or some other company decides to release all the episodes then I'm happy to spend 10 bucks.",1194220800,3,2713,4.673640167364017
2542216,5,B000EWBKO4,I am really glad that the ALF presentations are out on DVD.  I missed the little guy.,1170806400,4,85,4.0
2542217,2,B000EWBKO4,"My husband loved Alf when it was originally on TV.  He was excited to receive it on DVD as a Christmas gift.  Our kids (ages 10 and 5) love to watch it with him.  We have purchased each season as it becomes available.  I thought the kids would love the animated Alf just the same.  To my disappointment, they do not.  They prefer the original.  The ""Animated Adventures"" just doesn't hold their attention.  Not to mention that it confuses them because all the characters look similar and Alf goes by a different name.",1163203200,,517,4.483870967741935
2542218,5,B000EWBKO4,"I, too, been waiting for this.  I watched the series when I was in my 30's, and I was thrilled that the writers had gone to the trouble of creating a whole planet from scratch and had gone far beyond the call of duty in filling in the gratuitous details.  Every element of Melmac is its own.  Every cup and saucer is non-earthly.  Alien words are abundant.  Some of the background music is jaw-droppingly unfamiliar, while some of it is filled with jazz saxophone.  There are lots of ""Wow!"" moments.

And of course, at the same time, it's a great satire of American culture (and the military).  For instance, TV commercials pop up constantly (on perfectly circular Melmac TV screens).  In other words, this is true science fiction.  All begun a decade before ""Futurama"" (and a year before ""The Simpsons"" started).

This DVD contains the first 9 of the two seasons' 26 episodes.  I hope enough people buy Vol. 1 to justify Vols. 2 and 3, because there are episodes I'm still craving.

I also have to admit that it's somewhat hard to watch.  The animation is cheap: sometimes when something moves, it changes shades of color back and forth.  And the directing is awful.  For instance, there's often an awkward silence when they want you to focus on something visual.  And visual jokes sometimes go on too long.  I guess these criticisms apply to ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" somewhat, too, but that show wasn't as hard to watch.",1159660800,7,1420,4.657258064516129
2542219,5,B000EWBKO4,"Finally! After years of wishful thinking, it's happened. I'm so glad that animated Alf has seen the light of day! Over the years I managed to find a few PAL videotapes which I transferred to NTSC, but having so many episodes finally available on DVD is great. As was mentioned, the Alf animated series ranks up there with other modern classics. I've never understood why it didn't develop more of a following among animation fans, maybe these two releases will change that. Even folks who aren't fans of the 'flesh and fur' Alf owe it to themselves to check out the animated series. It is quite different from the primetime TV show, it has much more of an edge...very bizarre at times. The writing is excellent, as is the voice characterization. Awesome stuff all around, highly recommended!",1154390400,14,791,4.781021897810219
2542220,5,B000EWBKO4,"I've been waiting for this a long time.  I even wrote DIC entertainment 4 years ago to find out when ALF Tales and The ALF animated series would be released.  There was no answer.  Now my prayers have been answered.  It may sound like hyperbole, but the ALF cartoons rank with Rocky & Bullwinkle and other Jay Ward/Bill Scott creations - Fractured Fairy Tales, Mr. Peabody, Dudley Do-Right, George of the Jungle, et al - as some of the funniest cartoons ever created.  Not in the same genre as cartoons from the golden age of the movie studios - MGM, Tex Avery, Warner Bros. etc. - but of same limited animation as R&B where story and dialog count as the essential elements, these mini-masterpieces have done more than achieve a high level of hilarious, dead-on satire, but have also captured the spirit of the time in which they were created.",1144627200,22,843,4.593333333333334

2542230,5,B000EWBKO4,"How come we only get these two DVD's. There were 26 Alf Tales & I think 31 Alf Animated Adventures. A while back they were ALL listed & we were told that the rest were coming. Well that was several years ago now so if anyone knows if they are available please have Amazon inform me. I bought the two available DVD's from Amazon several years ago & am giving Amazon permission to forward my email address to reliable persons who might have any info on how or where to purchase the rest of these shows. I consider the Alf Shows & cartoons to be one of the best TV series ever.

8114954,1,B000EWBKO4,"Not only is this not the entire series - it would take at least two discs to do that - but these episodes have actually been EDITED in an attempt to squeeze as many on to one disc as possible!

Entire 5-10 seconds scenes have literally been shaved off several times throughout several episodes in various areas wherever the editors thought they could get away with it and supposedly not have it be noticed.

Thats worse than not having this on DVD at all!

A huge disappointment. If it had just been a couple of original, non-edited episodes, I would have been willing to forgive it as long as they were shown in their entirety. But this butchering is just cruel.

Nothing to do but wait for the *real* episodes to finally be released... sigh...",1516060800,,745,4.496296296296296
8114955,4,B000EWBKO4,"Alf stands for Alien Life Form. This unusual puppet known as Alf came from his planet known as Melmac. When he landed at the Tanners' Los Angeles suburban home, Alf became a member of the family. In this cartoon series that aired on Saturday mornings on NBC, Alf writes about his previous life in Melmac. Thankfully, animation can accomplish this feature. With Alf introducing each episode, he is known as Gordon Shumway on Melmac still with an appetite for cats.

If you enjoyed Alf in the primetime comedy series in the 1980s, you will enjoy revisiting Alf's life on Melmac in this animated series. Alf is still much around since he is a puppet. If Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and their friends can have Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame so should Alf for television.",1506816000,,773,4.642335766423358

I owned this DVD before and watched it a good 50 + times before  I lost it when we moved out of state. So many childhood memories. The flushed out alien world and culture of Melmac. The parodies and nods to other intellectual properties. The humor. This series still holds up well for its short run. Thank you again.",1449187200,,492,4.223404255319149
