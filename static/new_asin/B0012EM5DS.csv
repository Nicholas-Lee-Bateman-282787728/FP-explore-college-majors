3088794,5,B0012EM5DS,"Yay!  I had been hoping this would be out on DVD soon, and now the wait is over.  Becker is the best show on tv right now, even though it is reruns.  Can't wait for the remaining seasons!",1207180800,7,187,3.8684210526315788
3088795,5,B0012EM5DS,"I watched this show a lot of years ago, and still remembered it. I'm glad to see it released on DVD.",1201910400,4,100,3.8095238095238093
3088796,5,B0012EM5DS,"Boy, I sure hope that they don't rip us off with this long awaited release by using a lousy 1:33 aspect ratio on all seasons!!!  I've been watching the reruns in HD and guess what:  they're WIDE SCREEN, real wide screen, not this horrible stretch-across-the-flat panel that turns my stomach, and the picture is beautiful and clear.

Becker is one of my absolutely favorite sitcoms, and I never tire of watching the reruns because the humor just never fades.  For me, that's the trademark of top notch comedy all the way around.

Why networks have this uncanny ability to pull the plug on intelligent shows and leave the crap on forever is beyond me.  Looking at the reviews, there are plenty people still out there with their brains intact, so why not cater to us for a change?

AND YOU HAD BETTER RELEASE THE SHOW IN WIDE SCREEN, YOU MORONS!!!!!!!!! - Does anybody know how we can lodge complaints to get the sets in wide screen?",1201737600,12,930,4.566265060240964
3088797,5,B0012EM5DS,A great sitcom that was moved around too much or it would have lasted longer.,1201651200,5,77,4.2
3088798,5,B0012EM5DS,"The first season of Becker is full of great episodes. The plot lines have substance in addition to just humor. As well, the characters play off each other very strongly from the beginning of the show. Some of the highlights of the season are:
""Activate your choices"" the appearance of Dr. Becker's ex-wife, who has written a book about anger, and uses Becker as an example.

""Lucky Day"" everything goes right for Becker, which upsets him for the entire day.

All the episodes are good, and I look forward to the other five seasons.",1201305600,14,531,4.638297872340425
3088799,5,B0012EM5DS,"I love this show, the rerun episodes are aired at 12:30 am, I start work at 8:00 am, and still I watch it almost every night.
I sent emails to the producing studios years ago to release it on DVD,..all gone unanswered and ignored.
finally, I can sleep early, and still watch Becker, the doctor that says it as it is, and as all of us wish to be able to say it to all the ""Bob""s of our lives...",1201132800,7,393,3.925
3088800,5,B0012EM5DS,"Yes , I agree with all the other reviwers here. I've been waiting for ""Becker"" to be released on DVD for the past 2 years and now the wait is over !

3088801,5,B0012EM5DS,"Oh yes. Someone finally has put Becker on DVD. I like how they put the newer shows on DVD and it takes a long time to put a go show on DVD.  I bet if they were to bring Becker back now with what has transpired since the show ended, the writers could come up with realy good material to bring the show back, but we all know that will never happen.  Atleast we will be able to enjoy the shows that were produced and watch good comedy again.",1200614400,24,438,3.9101123595505616
3088802,5,B0012EM5DS,"Becker was one of my all time favorite sitcoms along with Cheers and Everybody Loves Raymond. I was sorry to see the series end and don't even bother watching today's mindless sitcoms. There hasn't been anything since to compare with Becker's wry humor and unique character roles. As in Raymond & Cheers, the casting was perfect! I was delighted to see that Season One will now be on DVD and I'll look forward to the other season's series to follow.

3088842,4,B0012EM5DS,"My wife and I got to about episode 3 or 4. We hadn't seen the first season of Becker, and much enjoyed learning how the series started off. The first episodes take no time at all descending into the forthright misanthropy that colors the whole series. Maybe Becker is just a little bit more human than average in the first episode, as we get to witness the crabbed, chain-smoking grump plop down his own savings to help a child with AIDS. Almost too good to stand. But the New Yawwk sarcasm and casual grouchiness are all there from the start, deliciously honest relief for those of us who live in the more repressed Christofascist provinces.

My only complaint - but it is a big one - is physical quality. The DVD started freezing up around episode 4. I felt too depresed to try to watch more. I don't like that ""ripped off"" feeling. Note to Amazon or whoever's responsible for quality assurance: pay that extra ten cents per copy, to guarantee the thing is reliable.",1398729600,2,968,4.531428571428571
3088843,5,B0012EM5DS,This series is great! I'm glad I purchased it. It arrived early and in excellent condition. I highly recommend this DVD series for anyone that liked the show. Plenty of laughs.,1394236800,,176,4.709677419354839
3088844,5,B0012EM5DS,No other words besides I love this show. I think it really shows real people and just because you work in a high position doesn't mean you need be some top high class person.,1392854400,,174,4.147058823529412

The show is absolutely hilarious and has so many great characters to feed off of. Loved Ted Danson in Cheers and he does an exceptional job portraying somebody that is so different from the role of Sam Malone.
 I recommend this show that loves truly well written comedy.",1376697600,,409,4.602739726027397
3088849,5,B0012EM5DS,"The episodes are packed with outstanding characters and situations.

3088850,3,B0012EM5DS,I bought this dvd for my mom and she loved them! The only problem I had with the product is the fact that one disc had a crack in it. This dvd still plays but it won't last for much longer.,1363132800,,189,3.6341463414634148

3088855,5,B0012EM5DS,Awsome.....thanks!  This item was received in a timely manner and was reasonably priced.  The CD's were in perfect condition and I would purchase something from this site again should I find anything.,1325376000,,200,5.21875
3088856,5,B0012EM5DS,Ted Danson embodies a walking and talking headache in the flesh.  And you gotta love him for it.  Great show!!!!!!,1277510400,,114,4.65
3088857,5,B0012EM5DS,"Everybody thought ""House M.D."" was such an original show when it debuted in 2004 with its wise-cracking sarcastic Dr. Gregory House. Though this was more of a drama, nobody seemed to realize that Ted Danson is the one who made that popular, way back in 1998 as Dr. John Becker.

""Becker"" is one of the funniest shows ever to hit TV, but sadly some casting changes and other behind-the-scenes squabbling brought the show to a slow demise after about six seasons. Ted Danson gives some of his best work here. If you think the rants of Dr. Cox on ""Scrubs"" are funny, just wait until Becker storms into his office ranting about the bums on the street, the city health department, the justice system, humanity in general or any one the upteen-million things that seem to make him angry.

The true heart of this show is it's sheer originality and unique characters - Becker's dim-witted female assistant, Linda, could have been a walking cliche were she portrayed by a busty blond, instead she's portrayed by the raven-haired Shawnee Smith (of ""Saw"" fame) with perfect comedic timing; Margaret is Dr. Becker's nurse, a heavy-set Bible-thumping black woman who is the perfect opposite of Becker's in-your-face sarcasm, anger and rants against God and religion; then there's Jake, Becker's blind best friend who, although he becomes the butt of many jokes, holds his own as one of the show's leading men; there's Reggie, the middle-aged ex-model turned diner owner who can't get a date despite her drop-dead gorgeous looks; and Bob, the fast talking nitwit who annoys everyone yet manages to remain an appealing part of the show. Other characters constantly move in and out of the show with many famous stars making guest appearances.

Naturally ""Becker"" falls prey to many common sitcom gags and it's formula never really changes, which makes it a bit redundant after a while. Still, it's not one to miss!",1264723200,4,1898,4.888198757763975
3088858,5,B0012EM5DS,Becker was a great show from the late 90s to the early 2000s that most people don't really know too much about. I think more people are discovering this great show on re-runs. The cast was terrific and I love the sarcastic humor of the show. I'm glad to see they are putting this show on DVD. I will collect all the seasons.,1258156800,,324,4.158730158730159
3088859,4,B0012EM5DS,"One of my pet peeves is people who comment on the content of a DVD or Blue-ray disc without telling you anything about the quality of the recording.

I'm not going to comment on the content. Anyone who's watched Becker knows how great the show was and doesn't need to be told again.

I'm elated that they're finally releasing Becker on DVD. But why did they have to screw up for the first season?

This DVD disables the instant replay button on my player. If I miss a line, it's a pain to rewind to play over again. I don't have the same problem with the second season. There they did it right. Other than that everything is great. Even closed captioning works so you don't miss any gags.",1253145600,,688,4.317829457364341
3088860,5,B0012EM5DS,"I almost wet my pants when I first heard this being finally released on DVD. Now we just have to hope they release the whole series, and not just the two first ones.

Ted Danson made an art out of being a thorny, cranky doc, but I also love Terry Farrell's performance. Too bad she went into bad relations with Danson & co thus costing her career in Hollywood.",1248134400,,360,4.217391304347826
3088861,5,B0012EM5DS,"If you like Becker you'll want this.  I got half way through the first season and ordered the second season.  You'll laugh just as you did watching these for the first time.  Don't think about it, just buy it!",1247875200,,209,4.3076923076923075
3088862,4,B0012EM5DS,"I can think of a lot worse ways to spend $[...] bucks.  The only difference between Becker and a lot of us, is that Becker says it out loud.  Not concerned with protocol, good manners, or malpractice insurance, Becker is committed to his patient's well-being, and doesn't mess with political correctness or ""red tape"".  He is surrounded by a variety of misfits that add to the hilarity, and sarcastic humor of this worthwhile show.  Great one-liners.",1240531200,,450,4.881578947368421
3088863,5,B0012EM5DS,"My husband's face lit up when he opened the package.  He loves Becker so it was a nice surprise for him!! He has watched this DVD over and over again and still laughs!!!

3088866,5,B0012EM5DS,I purchased this for my dad. He is an avid watcher of Becker reruns late at night. He just loves this show. After finally getting him to upgrade to a DVD player.

3088867,5,B0012EM5DS,"This is the show that relieves stress. When you watch, you either find yourself saying ""Yeah! You tell them Becker!"" or ""Linda????"" or ""Thank God for people like Margaret""... One either relates to Becker's angst or laughs at his whining and complaining. If you want to forget about life's doldrums and speed, watch Becker for a an hour. However, Where in the world are the rest of the seasons?????????????????",1224288000,,409,4.942028985507246

3088870,5,B0012EM5DS,"I loved this series. Becker says things most of us want to say but don't because it is going to possibly hurt some bodies feeling.

The purchase was made on Amazon.com but not a direct purchase. Some dvd's were no good and some shows were apparently recorded on fast forward mode.  We are pleased to see Amazon offering direct sales of Becker.  We have purchased the First Season and are constantly checking for more Seasons thru Amazon.com direct.

3088874,5,B0012EM5DS,"Unfortunally I slept on this show during it's initial primetime run but I caught it in syndication & let me tell you that I wish I saw this in primetime so I could have enjoyed this longer because this is one of the most underrated comedies to come out in recent years. Becker's character of someone who's heavily opinionated & isn't afraid to say what's on his mind is just gold. Eventhough that's the side that's present more than any other, you see other sides of him as well throughout the series as well showing that he does care about the people around him & his heart is in the right place where it matters (Pilot episode).  With other characters like Becker's best friend & blind newsstand owner Jake, supermodel to crappy cafe owner Reggie, more beauty than brains Linda, and Margret being the only one who's somewhat normal...just the right formula. Pick this up as this is a show you will laugh at & hopefully, all the other seaons will be released as well.",1216512000,3,968,4.531428571428571
3088875,5,B0012EM5DS,"Finally...after a 4-year wait since the series ended, it's SO great to finally be able to own Becker on DVD. Every character was great in their own unique way - and being a huge Shawnee Smith fan, I always enjoyed Linda and her quirkyness, hehe.

But..anyway...Season 1 is loaded with great episodes (well, pretty much ALL of them are classic). The ONLY down-side to this DVD, is the lack of Special Features - no commentaries, no behind-the-scenes footage, no deleted scenes...just the episiodes. But oh well - we got Becker on DVD!

3088889,5,B0012EM5DS,"Oddly enough my wife and I always loved BECKER when we used to catch it on TV during its original run, but we were never regular viewers.
I guess it came on at a time slot we just missed.

We really watched it more in syndication and of course now on the DVD collection.

The best thing I can say about BECKER is even though they write the show to kind of stab some fun at him........ the truth is he is right on the mark about 99% of the time on the things he gripes about........ (ie.. people acting stupid, rude neighbors playing loud music, stereotypes, the  silliness of political correctness, etc...)

BECKER has the right viewpoint most of the time.

I have to confess we started losing interest in the show after Reggi & Bob left.
Like many TV shows, the ""chemistry"" between leading cast often makes the show.
The ""chemistry"" of BECKER was lost quite a bit when Nancy Travis joined the show.
We found her a real negative detraction from the series.",1207699200,16,956,4.409090909090909
3088890,5,B0012EM5DS,"Channel surfing one night, a few years back, changed my viewing pleasure as I found Becker. I missed the first season over here in NZ and so was absolutely thrilled to find it listed at Amazon.

It has now been approx 2 months and 7 days since I pre orderd the season 1 release. It should be here by the weekend and I have planned to watch it all over 2 days!!!

For its dry, hold no punches comedy it has to be one of the greats. Ted Danson gives us yet another character that you sometimes wish you had the guts to be like and get away with it.

Why is it that the great shows are cut off in their prime or moved to late night TV? And yet the mindless crap still gets prime time spots that I can't believe anybody really watches and enjoys.

The answer to this I fear will never be known, all I can say is keep releasing the greats to DVD ... All seasons of Becker are definitely on my purchase list.",1207526400,8,902,3.9944444444444445

I've been watching the reruns in HD and guess what:  they're WIDE SCREEN, real wide screen, not this horrible stretch-across-the-flat panel that turns my stomach, and the picture is beautiful and clear.

Becker is one of my absolutely favorite sitcoms, and I never tire of watching the reruns because the humor just never fades.  For me, that's the trademark of top notch comedy all the way around.

Why networks have this uncanny ability to pull the plug on intelligent shows and leave the crap on forever is beyond me.  Looking at the reviews, there are plenty people still out there with their brains intact, so why not cater to us for a change?

""Activate your choices"" the appearance of Dr. Becker's ex-wife, who has written a book about anger, and uses Becker as an example.

""Lucky Day"" everything goes right for Becker, which upsets him for the entire day.

3323339,4,B0012EM5DS,"My wife and I got to about episode 3 or 4. We hadn't seen the first season of Becker, and much enjoyed learning how the series started off. The first episodes take no time at all descending into the forthright misanthropy that colors the whole series. Maybe Becker is just a little bit more human than average in the first episode, as we get to witness the crabbed, chain-smoking grump plop down his own savings to help a child with AIDS. Almost too good to stand. But the New Yawwk sarcasm and casual grouchiness are all there from the start, deliciously honest relief for those of us who live in the more repressed Christofascist provinces.

My only complaint - but it is a big one - is physical quality. The DVD started freezing up around episode 4. I felt too depresed to try to watch more. I don't like that ""ripped off"" feeling.

3323354,5,B0012EM5DS,"Everybody thought ""House M.D."" was such an original show when it debuted in 2004 with its wise-cracking sarcastic Dr. Gregory House. Though this was more of a drama, nobody seemed to realize that Ted Danson is the one who made that popular, way back in 1998 as Dr. John Becker.

""Becker"" is one of the funniest shows ever to hit TV, but sadly some casting changes and other behind-the-scenes squabbling brought the show to a slow demise after about six seasons. Ted Danson gives some of his best work here. If you think the rants of Dr. Cox on ""Scrubs"" are funny, just wait until Becker storms into his office ranting about the bums on the street, the city health department, the justice system, humanity in general or any one the upteen-million things that seem to make him angry.

The true heart of this show is it's sheer originality and unique characters - Becker's dim-witted female assistant, Linda, could have been a walking cliche were she portrayed by a busty blond, instead she's portrayed by the raven-haired Shawnee Smith (of ""Saw"" fame) with perfect comedic timing; Margaret is Dr. Becker's nurse, a heavy-set Bible-thumping black woman who is the perfect opposite of Becker's in-your-face sarcasm, anger and rants against God and religion; then there's Jake, Becker's blind best friend who, although he becomes the butt of many jokes, holds his own as one of the show's leading men; there's Reggie, the middle-aged ex-model turned diner owner who can't get a date despite her drop-dead gorgeous looks; and Bob, the fast talking nitwit who annoys everyone yet manages to remain an appealing part of the show. Other characters constantly move in and out of the show with many famous stars making guest appearances.

Naturally ""Becker"" falls prey to many common sitcom gags and it's formula never really changes, which makes it a bit redundant after a while. Still, it's not one to miss!",1264723200,4,1898,4.888198757763975
3323355,5,B0012EM5DS,Becker was a great show from the late 90s to the early 2000s that most people don't really know too much about. I think more people are discovering this great show on re-runs. The cast was terrific and I love the sarcastic humor of the show. I'm glad to see they are putting this show on DVD. I will collect all the seasons.,1258156800,,324,4.158730158730159
3323356,4,B0012EM5DS,"One of my pet peeves is people who comment on the content of a DVD or Blue-ray disc without telling you anything about the quality of the recording.

I'm not going to comment on the content. Anyone who's watched Becker knows how great the show was and doesn't need to be told again.

I'm elated that they're finally releasing Becker on DVD. But why did they have to screw up for the first season?

This DVD disables the instant replay button on my player. If I miss a line, it's a pain to rewind to play over again. I don't have the same problem with the second season. There they did it right. Other than that everything is great. Even closed captioning works so you don't miss any gags.",1253145600,,688,4.317829457364341

Ted Danson made an art out of being a thorny, cranky doc, but I also love Terry Farrell's performance. Too bad she went into bad relations with Danson & co thus costing her career in Hollywood.",1248134400,,360,4.217391304347826

3323359,4,B0012EM5DS,"I can think of a lot worse ways to spend $[...] bucks.  The only difference between Becker and a lot of us, is that Becker says it out loud.  Not concerned with protocol, good manners, or malpractice insurance, Becker is committed to his patient's well-being, and doesn't mess with political correctness or ""red tape"".  He is surrounded by a variety of misfits that add to the hilarity, and sarcastic humor of this worthwhile show.  Great one-liners.",1240531200,,450,4.881578947368421

You tell them Becker!"" or ""Linda????"" or ""Thank God for people like Margaret""... One either relates to Becker's angst or laughs at his whining and complaining. If you want to forget about life's doldrums and speed, watch Becker for a an hour. However, Where in the world are the rest of the seasons?????????????????",1224288000,,409,4.942028985507246

The purchase was made on Amazon.com but not a direct purchase. Some dvd's were no good and some shows were apparently recorded on fast forward mode.  We are pleased to see Amazon offering direct sales of Becker.  We have purchased the First Season and are constantly checking for more Seasons thru Amazon.com direct.

3323371,5,B0012EM5DS,"Unfortunally I slept on this show during it's initial primetime run but I caught it in syndication & let me tell you that I wish I saw this in primetime so I could have enjoyed this longer because this is one of the most underrated comedies to come out in recent years. Becker's character of someone who's heavily opinionated & isn't afraid to say what's on his mind is just gold. Eventhough that's the side that's present more than any other, you see other sides of him as well throughout the series as well showing that he does care about the people around him & his heart is in the right place where it matters (Pilot episode).  With other characters like Becker's best friend & blind newsstand owner Jake, supermodel to crappy cafe owner Reggie, more beauty than brains Linda, and Margret being the only one who's somewhat normal...just the right formula. Pick this up as this is a show you will laugh at & hopefully, all the other seaons will be released as well.",1216512000,3,968,4.531428571428571
3323372,5,B0012EM5DS,"Finally...after a 4-year wait since the series ended, it's SO great to finally be able to own Becker on DVD. Every character was great in their own unique way - and being a huge Shawnee Smith fan, I always enjoyed Linda and her quirkyness, hehe.

But..anyway...Season 1 is loaded with great episodes (well, pretty much ALL of them are classic). The ONLY down-side to this DVD, is the lack of Special Features - no commentaries, no behind-the-scenes footage, no deleted scenes...just the episiodes. But oh well - we got Becker on DVD!

Now it's time to wait for Seasons 2 - 6. . .",1214784000,2,579,4.5576923076923075

I got the 1st season DVD set as soon as it came out and we have watched them over and over.  We travel a lot and are so excited when we find a channel that is running the re-runs.  I have rarely watched a series like this that can make me laugh until my sides hurt.  PLEASE, PLEASE get the next seasons out on DVD sets really soon.  I can hardly wait!!",1214438400,2,467,3.8125

3323386,5,B0012EM5DS,"Oddly enough my wife and I always loved BECKER when we used to catch it on TV during its original run, but we were never regular viewers.
I guess it came on at a time slot we just missed.

We really watched it more in syndication and of course now on the DVD collection.

The best thing I can say about BECKER is even though they write the show to kind of stab some fun at him........ the truth is he is right on the mark about 99% of the time on the things he gripes about........ (ie.. people acting stupid, rude neighbors playing loud music, stereotypes, the  silliness of political correctness, etc...)

BECKER has the right viewpoint most of the time.

I have to confess we started losing interest in the show after Reggi & Bob left.
Like many TV shows, the ""chemistry"" between leading cast often makes the show.
The ""chemistry"" of BECKER was lost quite a bit when Nancy Travis joined the show.
We found her a real negative detraction from the series.",1207699200,16,956,4.409090909090909
3323387,5,B0012EM5DS,"Channel surfing one night, a few years back, changed my viewing pleasure as I found Becker. I missed the first season over here in NZ and so was absolutely thrilled to find it listed at Amazon.

It has now been approx 2 months and 7 days since I pre orderd the season 1 release. It should be here by the weekend and I have planned to watch it all over 2 days!!!

For its dry, hold no punches comedy it has to be one of the greats. Ted Danson gives us yet another character that you sometimes wish you had the guts to be like and get away with it.

Why is it that the great shows are cut off in their prime or moved to late night TV? And yet the mindless crap still gets prime time spots that I can't believe anybody really watches and enjoys.

The answer to this I fear will never be known, all I can say is keep releasing the greats to DVD ... All seasons of Becker are definitely on my purchase list.",1207526400,8,902,3.9944444444444445
