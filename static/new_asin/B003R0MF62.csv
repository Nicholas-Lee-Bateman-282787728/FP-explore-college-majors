4173543,5,B003R0MF62,"Even though this show is about sex crimes, it's very close to real life. I think this is by far my favorite Law and Order because of the cast. Hargitay and Meloni make excellent partners as well as Belzer and Ice T. The humor that they add into episodes I think fits with the situation the detectives handle. They pretty much cover all angles of sex crimes and child abuse. I think what sets this show apart from other shows is the many angles of these crimes. For example disabled victims who can't talk, abused foster kids, gay men infected with HIV. Not every episode is exactly the same, the suspects are from different backgrounds and have different motives. The victims also are from many different backrounds and in some episodes end up being suspects. A lot of the viewers get a look into the crimes against other nationalities also making every episode unique.",1313798400,13,869,4.64935064935065

4173737,5,B003R0MF62,"Good-bye Detective Elliot Stabler, so sad to see you go...more than you know. I was just becoming a fan of the show, when I found out long time alumni Chris Meloni (Det. Elliot Stabler), was leaving the show, for good. Suffice it to say, the show hasn't been the same since he left. The chemistry between him and Mariska Hargitay (Det. Olivia Benson) is truly what made the show so compelling. Considering that I've yet to see Chris Meloni get another series with staying power, I would think that he'd welcome the chance to come back. Another treat for me in this Season was seeing Debra Messing (perhaps best known as Grace in WILL & GRACE) in the episode PURSUIT....prior to that her co-star Eric McCormack was in Season 11 in the episode SUGAR. In short, I miss Chris Meloni....the show just hasn't been the same w/o him.",1435190400,,825,4.581081081081081

4173840,4,B003R0MF62,"After while I'm sure all of my reviews about Law & Order SVU sound the same.  That's what happens when a show has been around for as long as SVU has.  And that's not a bad thing.  It isn't that all the episodes are the same.  The lack of originality in my reviews more stem from not wanting to give the plots away for all the episodes rather than a lack of detail in the show itself.

Law and Order SVU is about the Special Victims Unit.  For those of you somehow stumbling into this review without having heard of this show before, this means the police force that deals with the special crimes of rape, and abuse of elders and children.  Anything with a sexual overtone is also included.  Because of these hard topics, it's probably not considered a show for kids.  And some of the episodes contain very hard topics.  ""Behave"" is especially frightening, with a woman being stalked and re-raped by her abuser every few years to the extent that she is no longer able to cope or leave the house.  It was probably the best episode of the season.  There were a few I didn't like though.  ""Pop"" which was a fight club type of episode that didn't have sympathetic characters.  ""Bombshell"" which involved alternative lifestyles and then went even wackier with incest.  I'm not saying these things don't happen in real life, but the way they were portrayed in this season was almost cheesy.

Characters:

  Christopher Meloni as Det. Elliot Stabler
  Mariska Hargitay as Det. Olivia Benson
  Richard Belzer as Sgt. John Munch
  Ice-T as Det. Fin Tutuola
  B. D. Wong as Dr. George Huang
  Tamara Tunie as Dr. Melinda Warner
  Dann Florek as Capt. Don Cragen

The cast doesn't change too much in this series (although I hear that changes next season).  You've got Meloni and Hargitay as the hard hitters.  They have great on-screen chemistry and really work well together.  You'd almost wish they were real detectives out there getting the bad guys.  Belzer again isn't in this season as much.  He's almost a guest character with as little as he appears in this show in the last few years.  Ice-T had a little bit of a bigger role, but always as a support to Hargitay or Meloni.  And I didn't see too much of Cragen in this one, which was a disappointment.  Some of the bad guys were cheesy this go around and some were actually sympathetic.  You wanted to hate some of them but just couldn't because of their pitiable past.

The camera work is just as gruesome as any other season.  There's blood, murder, associations with rape and other things.  Plus a visit to a sex club (although no sex is actually shown) among other things are in this season.  It's not entirely graphic but it's enough that viewers who are sensitive to these things should take caution.  More of the film work focuses on the detectives talking to people and interviewing suspects though.  And that's the better part of the show as it involves character interaction.

I've got mixed feelings heading into the next season but this one wasn't too bad and is a load better than a ton of other shows out there right now.  At least this one tries to raise awareness and seek justice.

4173841,5,B003R0MF62,"Not one single season has been a let-down. Even with all the changes they made to the main characters and bringing in new people, SVU still is the best Law and Order show!!!!",1358985600,,174,4.303030303030303
4173842,5,B003R0MF62,"Any real fan of the Law & Order Special Victim's Unit knows our favorite hot head Eliot Stabler.  Well this season was his last and he sure gave us many fine episodes of his unique fun heated action here.  This was the last LAW & Order to be filmed in the raw gritty New York City style I have come to love acrosss the entire Law & Order Franchise.  I always felt Special Victims Unit was truly unique because; it handled the most painful subjects in a sensitive but direct way.  Eliot Stabler was a Jarhead and a HOT Head but you always knew his heart was in the right place.  He stood for the victim no matter what their age, race or gender.  Eliot was a passionate character who was haunted at times even tormented by his flaws.  Eliots flaws are what made him the most human and this was his last and best ever season.

Yes Eliot rides into the sunset at the end of this 12th season after these many years fighting the good fight angainst multitudonous Special Victoms Unit evil doers.  The nice thing is Eliot does not die, he just gets that well deserved good rest all truely awesome policemen should have after years protecting good people from the hellraisers in even his fictional New York community.  The rest of the acting is top notch as you have come to expect in, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year!  If anything I would say the 12 year stories are some of the best tightly written well acted SUV dramas ever.  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year exzudes all the qualities that made Law & Order SVU a must see show.  I must admit this 12th Season is one of my most favorite Law & Order runs ever.  Every person involved seemed to step up their game in Season 12 Eliot's final season and it shows in the consistant high quality of work here.

Eliot goes out in typical Stabler style but I won't reveal how here.  Buy Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year and find out for yourself.  I don't think you will be disappointed I wasn't!  Enjoy!",1357776000,4,2002,4.307486631016043

4173871,1,B003R0MF62,"Some will say that this probably ""just another grr-reat year of SVU."" That will be their opinion as this is mine we're all allowed to disagree. With that being said, this season is actually part of the three worst seasons of SVU in my opinion. It would probably easier to list the episodes I did like. The one with Jennifer Love Hewitt (mainly b/c of the crossover with LA), the Campus rape episode, Christine Lahti's last epiosde, the one where Casey Novak returns and DDA Dekker makes a guest appaerance, the last one with Jeremy Irons, the with the masked freak and the one written by Chris Brancato about an abduction and blackmail. The one episode that I striaght out hate most is ""Bombshell."" And I remember that one by heart because it was the worst hour of TV i have ever wasted. There were a lot of stupid characters in this episode and as for the plot, well you didn't have to be a psychic to see how awful it was going to end once your were halfway through the episode. It is as if the show had lost its quality. Nearly every episode ended with cliche ""plot-twist"" of a death, but it didn't make you feel anything. Not even sympathy. The only deaths that were really meaningful were ADA Paxton (if you think she improved from season 11) and the victim's daughter in the last episode. There's very little element of actual police procedure, there's very little emotion. In fact the only the only emotion happens to be Stabler's anger, but even that looked like it was overdone and like most of the cast it was getting old. But my biggest complaint was the lacking of Sergeant John Munch, who by the way has supervisor duties over all the detectives, which was for the most part ignored throughout seasons 9-12. Where was the veteran Baltimore Homicide Detective who left dead bodies in Baltimore to be with living traumatized victims in New York?

For the quality of the product, I have nothing to say. But the quality of the episodes is pretty much drained. SVU use to be unique and standout from most of the crap on TV, but this season and the two before it are now just the same as anything else. I will gladly recommend good episodes and good ""SVU"" episodes from these three seasons, but I will certainly not recommend seasons 10-12. If you just like to watch SVU to see Stabler, Benson or both, then by all means buy this season even though there is no character development. Buy this season if you are just a collector or a loyal fan of SVU or all things Law & Order. But if you're looking for a good quality show, with great plots with victims that will make you sympathize and suspects that'll make your skin crawl then get the older seasons or season 13.
But by all means this is a must for Elliot Stabler fans, for this is sadly his last season on the show. I wish Mr. Meloni all the best in his career, he is a tremendous actor and I hope he will find great roles to fill. Thank you Mr. Meloni for 12 years you've given us.",1349568000,3,2944,4.391941391941392

4173894,5,B003R0MF62,"It has its ups and downs, but thumbs up all the way from me.  From the 1st to the 12th seasons they always come up with new interesting topics, and they tastefully bring back oldies but goodies.  I prefer true crime, in the sense that reality is better than someone making something up, most of the time, but this series is innovative, gut wrenching, compelling, funny even, episode after episode.  I forewarn, it's not for weak stomachs or sissies.  If you can't deal with the fact that horrible, unfair, tragic, brutal things happen to innocent victims everyday; and brave people fight for justice, this is not for you. If you want to be entertained by writing, and characters that are dynamic and even lovable, this show has it.  It will get you thinking, debating, and questioning things you never knew, and thought you had decided on.",1342051200,,839,4.719178082191781
4173895,5,B003R0MF62,I love Law & Order Special Victims Unit and have been collecting the series from the beginning. Although I am going to miss Elliot (Christopher Meloni). It's not quite the same without him.,1341792000,,189,4.757575757575758
4173896,5,B003R0MF62,This season (12) is by far the BEST!  I watched every single episode and couldn't wait to get to the next one.  This one is a winner and a must have for any fan.,1336348800,,161,3.7058823529411766
4173897,5,B003R0MF62,Over the years I have managed to collect all 12 seasons.  I love this show and my 5 star rating reflects this.  The quality of the discs is in question.  Almost every season has the label half scraped off the disc.  I'm not sure if this is a deliberate design or a production error???? but it looks kind of junky. pk,1334188800,,316,4.131147540983607

4173901,5,B003R0MF62,"As usual with Law and Order Special Victims Unit there were lots of great stories. This was the 12th season and the last season with Det. Elliot Stabler.

Got my dvd's quickly and in good condition.",1323216000,,198,4.5
4173902,5,B003R0MF62,"Great season, sorry to see Elliot Stabler go, I love massively flawed characters like him who feel the ends justify the means. Not as good as Dennis Franz on NYPD Blue, who was the ultimately flawed cop, but had nothing but the best of intentions in his personal life. Stabler reminded me a little of him, always wanting to kill a pedophile, but not with the great comebacks that Sipowicz ( yeah I know I'm spelling that wrong) had. They both had the best of intentions on the job and ultimately were always about family. Sorry to see you go Mr. Meloni. You are a great actor, and easy on the eyes as well. I enjoyed watching you on SVU these last 12 years. I am sorry you had to be yet another casualty of Dick Wolf's revolving door of changes in casts. Or maybe you wanted to go. Either way you will be missed.",1321488000,12,812,4.245161290322581
