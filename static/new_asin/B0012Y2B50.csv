8248191,3,B0012Y2B50,"DEATH RIDES A HORSE

Released in 1967 and directed by Giulio Petroni, Death Rides a Horse is a Spaghetti Western about an orphaned boy who grows up (John Phillip Law) to seek vengeance on the savage thugs who slaughtered and raped his family members. He teams-up, sort of, with an ex-convict (Lee Van Cleef) whos after the same scumbags.

This has most of the attributes of Italo Westerns: Shot in Spain, poor dubbing, grim caricatures rather than three-dimensional characters, comic book violence, women existing solely to be abused, revenge (or greed) motif, awkward editing and a quirky score by the incredible Ennio Morricone. Both Law and Van Cleef are fitting and effective for their roles but, curiously, Law is typically lambasted by critics as wooden while Van Cleef is extoled. Actually, Law played the role as written and directed; sort of a Man with No Name type who constantly chews on a toothpick.

While this is a worthwhile Spaghetti Western its hampered by a one-dimensional revenge story, over-length (for the thin plot), a lack of any prominent female character (and no notable secondary characters either) and a half-interesting/half-dull vibe where you find your mind periodically wandering. However, the relation that develops between the two protagonists is good. Reportedly, Death Rides a Horse was a favorite of Quentin Tarantino and it influenced his Kill Bill.

The movie runs 114 minutes and was shot in Spain.

GOD'S GUN

Released in 1976-77, ""God's Gun"" is a Matzo Ball Western about a preacher (Lee Van Cleef) who chases down a band of outlaws (led by Jack Palance) to apprehend a murderer. After the thugs get revenge the preacher's spiritual son (Leif Garrett) teams-up with the one person who can set things aright. Sybil Danning co-stars as a saloon girl and Richard Boone has a minor role.

This Hebraic Western is stylized with a Spaghetti flavor, but is badly executed. I could never get a grip on the tone the filmmakers were shooting for. Is it semi-camp? Semi-parody? It's obviously not something to take too seriously, but sometimes the viewer's evidently supposed to. Since you can't take the story seriously it prevents you from caring about the events of the story and thus it's boring.

Thankfully, there are some highlights. For one, it was shot in Israel, which is unique for a Western. Secondly, there are a few stunning women, including Sybil Danning when she was around 23 and an uncredited saloon babe named Jessie. Thirdly, it's got Jack Palance and Lee Van Cleef; two Western icons. And, fourthly, Leif Garrett is surprisingly good at around 13 years-old.

But the confused tone and relative dullness do it in.

The film runs 94 minutes.

GRADE: Borderline D+/C- (3.5/10 Stars)

CRY BLOOD, APACHE

Released in 1970 and directed by Jack Starrett, ""Cry Blood, Apache"" is a low-budget American Western about a group of white dirtbags with gold fever who murder a camp of Apaches while allowing a squaw (Marie Gahva) to live in order to take 'em to a gold mine. Meanwhile a relative of the captive, a silent brave (Marcus Rudnick), tracks them down and gets vengeance one by one. Jody McCrea plays the only redeemable person of the bunch while the director plays the hypocritical Bible-quoting nutjob. The burly bearded guy was Leif Garrett's father, believe it or not.

This is actually a late 60s/early 70s exploitation thriller in disguise. Some of the Apache's torture methods, like hanging a person upside down in a stream and placing a bag with a deadly snake over someone's head, are rather chilling without being overly graphic. ""Cry Blood, Apache"" is a barbaric revenge yarn produced by the protagonist Jody McCrea, who enlisted his dad, Joel McCrea, from retirement to play the old-aged version of his character in the prologue and epilogue for (I guess) name recognition.

The director went on to better things, like 1975's ""Race with the Devil,"" but here he was obviously hampered by the low-budget and the movie comes across inept in some ways (like some of the editing, acting, dubbing & dialogue), which will spur a lot of viewers to hit the 'stop' button (or switch channels). But the film has some rewarding elements despite the tediousness and meaninglessness of it all. For instance, you can't beat the gritty realism. The main characters come across as a group of degenerates with gold fever in the desert, with the questionable exception of Pitcalin (McCrea). Their disheveled and torn clothing looks right. And Rudnick is quite credible as the laconic, merciless and torturous Apache warrior. The obvious question is: Why is Pitcalin riding with these moral-less swine? I suppose because he's desperate and needs the money. While he obviously laments the needless murders, he probably ""writes them off"" as expected collateral damage.

""Cry Blood, Apache"" is gritty, dismal, desolate, inhospitable, nihilistic, torturous, tedious and inept. It's also unforgettable.

The film runs 82 minutes and was shot in Arizona and Sequoia National Forest.
