If you are considering a trip to GB or in fact anywhere in Europe then this series is recommended.",1319587200,2,232,4.4186046511627906

8468952,5,B005ERMDHW,I was in England and Scotland 4 years ago and it was nice to see parts of the British Isles that I didn't get to see while I was there.  I just wish that Rudy Maxa had shown the cities of Edinbergh and Glasgow in Scotland and some of the cities and towns in other parts of the English countryside.,1407283200,2,297,3.95
8468953,4,B005ERMDHW,"Rudy does a good job, the only thing is that more time could have been devoted to what is obviously a big subject.

I was a little disappointed that there is only half an hour on outside of London.

Rudy is at his best when he is arty, and this came out in his London pgm.",1388620800,2,272,3.8392857142857144
8468954,5,B005ERMDHW,The travel videos of Rudy Maxa are outstanding.  His videos make you wish you were there and are great for the traveler or anyone interested in countries covered by a particular video.  Blu-ray discs make the outstanding filming/photography the best.  I really enjoy watching them and would highly recommend them.,1386374400,,313,5.22
8468955,5,B005ERMDHW,I liked this Blu-ray version of Rudy Maxa's travels in Britain a lot. The images are stunning in blu-ray HD and his commentary is both informative and entertaining. Great for doing prep for an upcoming trip or reflecting on times spent there already. Highly recommended.,1363824000,2,270,5.022222222222222
