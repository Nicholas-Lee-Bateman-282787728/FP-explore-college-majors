4132327,5,B003K1H12Q,"Great film with beautiful shots of Torquay and Oliver Reed at his finest as the very handsome young local photographer on the pull for townie girls as well as tourist girls on Holiday. Jane Merrow is also divine as the upper class model who's father owns an estate in town. Don't want to give any of the plot away but like ""I'll Never Forget What'is Name"" this film is essential viewing about the sexual revolution in the 60s",1333497600,4,425,4.461538461538462
4132328,5,B003K1H12Q,The System is a well told tale of a group of young Brits who line up a bunch of female vacationers for sex and fun over the summer. They prey on the innocent young girls and each of them have their own system to get close to the young ladies. Oliver Reed is the leader of this group and uses photography to connect with his conquest. But Olly is the one in the end who gets played after he falls in love with a rich society girl. This is Oliver Reed at the beginning of his career and is a joy to watch. The only flaw is that's it shot in B & W and we don't see his lovely blue eyes. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the British youth of the 1960's and all Oliver Reed fans. It was right after this movie when Olly was attached in a pub and was scarred for life.,1331510400,7,776,3.8867924528301887
4132329,4,B003K1H12Q,"Kenneth Shipman Productions presents ""Best of British Classics Series"" ~ ""THE GIRL-GETTERS"" (aka:The System) (1964) UK)(87 min/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Here is a very low budget and rarely seen little film that shows both the potential of both star (Oliver Reed) and director (Michael Winner)

The director Michael Winner had ventured his craft into something more serious and representative of the 60s, rather than the pop groups of the day --- Note the lead role went to Oliver Reed who had done Hammer Horror roles prior --- You get some idea of what kind of screen presence Reed had before drink took over his career --- Reed plays Tinker the photographer, the leader of a randy gang in Brighton --- Reed is exceptional in his role --- With a great supporting cast and story line that gets under the skin of the decade and slowly brings out all the taboos of the day.

Michael Winner [Director]
Peter Draper [Writer]
George Fowler [Associate Producer]
Kenneth Shipman [Producer]

Hats off and thanks to Robert Blair and his staff at VCI Entertainment --- The whole British holiday atmosphere is wonderfully captured --- As Denis Norden once said: ""it will take you back - even if you were never there originally!"" --- Peter Draper wrote the thoughtful script, he later collaborated with Reed and Winner on the equally memorable ''I'll Never Forget What's 'is name"" (1967) --- He really should have penned more films.

8398609,5,B003K1H12Q,"This is one of my favorite Oliver Reed films, but I have so many. For complete film information, IMDB and Wikipedia have articles and people here often write excellent reviews. This concerns the releases. There is no Blu-ray for this film, crime if you ask me, and no HD digital version, as of 2017. However, there are DVD releases aplenty. The European releases are all sped up, PAL releases and, while they do have slightly better picture, with 576i resolution as compared to our 480p, they also have sped up sound, which makes the actors sound a bit young and a bit high. The best release I have found is this one, the VCI release of The Girl-Getters (original title), B003K1H12Q here on Amazon, the Region 1 release. This film was in Black & White, again, not in color. I have no idea why the cover is in color but, again, the film is not, now, nor was it ever in color and the transfer is really quite wonderful for a 480p resolution. It was creatively directed so don't panic, the picture is supposed to cut suddenly periodically and slide off the screen once in a while.

One note, this is an enjoyable drama, if you are into that kind of film, but is very much a regional story. The issue of resort towns and the people who live in them is often romanticized in films and television programs but, here, is taken to the uncomfortable reality of what it would actually be like to be a young person faced with life in such a place. From what I've been told, by older relatives and some younger acquaintances who have lived that reality, it still holds up as one of the more accurate portrayals of life in these seaside British towns, when the families and single tourists role in for their getaways.",1503360000,2,1704,4.461538461538462
8398610,2,B003K1H12Q,"Oliver Reed was certainly great to look at but the role or script did not do him justice.  His innate acting skill, which was inherently in his genes, deserved a much meatier role.",1501891200,,180,4.454545454545454
8398611,5,B003K1H12Q,"Well made movie, and way more serious than reviews indicated. This is no beach blanket lightweight film, with some of the best work by Ron Moody.

8398612,4,B003K1H12Q,"The System, aka The Girl Getters in The UK, is a very well written, directed, and photographed film that perfectly captures the period of the early to mid-60's in England. It stars Oliver Reed as Tinker, who lives all year at a British seaside resort. Reed plays a photographer who picks up young women at the shore and essentially uses them for his own pleasure. When he finally meets a young, rich model named Nicola, who is from London, played by Jane Merrow, he falls in love with her and finally receives his come-uppance, so to seek. She leaves him alone and Reed finally feels what its like to be used. The film is very well directed by Michael Winner, and the cinematography is done by a young Nicolas Roeg. All 3, Reed, Winner, and Roeg, go on to achieve much great success during the late 60's into the 70's. The supporting cast provides excellent help, especially Barbara Ferris as Suzy, Julia Harris as Lorna, and David Hemmings, who would go on to achieve star status in just 2 years with the excellent film Blow-Up(1966). The title song is very good and is performed by The Searchers. I should note, however, that the film is in black and white, not color, as advertised. The duration is 90 minutes and the script, written by Peter Draper, is very good. The transfer to DVD is Pristine. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!",1443398400,,1326,4.59915611814346

8398617,5,B003K1H12Q,"Michael Winner is one of those under-appreciated filmmakers whose later career overshadows a body of work that
rivals that of Tony Richardson and Lindsay Anderson. The System is one of the best of the cluttered Hard Day's Night Era films.
Shot by Nicholas Roeg and full of sparkling dialogue that sets up and then pillories early 60s morality and youth culture,
The System also features kids and adults twisting to pop music while living in a seaside English village whose traditions
seem leftover from the Middle Ages. David Hemmings plays a major supporting role; three years later he would exemplify
the spirit of Swinging London in Antonioni's Blow Up. A real unexpected pleasure that has elevated Michael Winner, for me,
into the pantheon of Great British Film Makers.",1367625600,4,773,5.046875
