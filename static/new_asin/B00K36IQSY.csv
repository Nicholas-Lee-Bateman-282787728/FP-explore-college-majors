8655653,5,B00K36IQSY,"Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures consists of the following movies of the Indiana Jones franchise.

*The Raiders of the Lost Ark - the first film of the Indiana Jones franchise. It is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride. This is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with.

*Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom - the sequel to The Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Set years before the events of the first film, it is sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun.

*Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade - the third film of the Indiana Jones franchise. Of the three Jones films, it may well become the sentimental favorite. It captures some of the sense of fun that infused the first movie as it was lighter and more comedic than its predecessor,the movie returns the series to the brisk serial adventure of Raiders Of The Lost Ark while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father and son dynamic.

*Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull - the fourth movie of the franchise. Though the plot elements are certainly familiar, it still delivers the thrills and Harrison Ford's return in the title role is more than welcome for he still has the charisma to reinvent one of the most-beloved characters in screen history. It isn't bad but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone.

This is one great collection of films that a Polish-speaking Indiana Jones fan would surely want to own.",1414540800,,1579,4.585106382978723
