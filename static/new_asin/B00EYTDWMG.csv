8610434,5,B00EYTDWMG,"This is the absolute must for every Nordic Noir fan, as this series is rightfully considered to be a cornerstone of the genre. ''Forbrydelsen'' aired its first season in 2007 when the Scandinavian crime fiction was not as widely known and acclaimed as today and gained instant popularity both in Scandinavian countries as well as the U.K. audiences establishing many characteristics that later on would be imitated by a large number of authors from the northern European countries. The gloomy atmosphere, the socially awkward main protagonist-detective, the emphasis on the social and familial consequences of the crime and the well-crafted plot and character development are some of those traits that the series introduced to mass audiences and managed to gain large popularity and an almost legendary status among the crime television productions of both Europe and U.S. (note that an American remake was made starring the Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman and Mireille Enos). The central character of Sara Lund is one of the most peculiar, nevertheless interesting criminal investigators in Copenhagen police force, who faces great difficulties in her interpersonal relationships (as her ''successor'' Saga Noren in ''Bron/Broen'') but is absolutely devoted to each case which always becomes sort of personal for her. Sofie Grbl does a terrific job in portraying a difficult main character and she is surrounded by a bunch of great Danish actors such as Sren Malling, Lars Mikkelsen, Bjarne Henriksen, Nicolaj Kopernikus and many others. The only negative aspect in the series is the length of the first season (20 episodes of one hour) which could be denser and more suspenseful, but seasons two and three are limited in ten episodes of one hour. ''Forbrydelsen'' is a tv series which should be watched, apart from the entertainment factor of course, due to the profound influence that it had to later television productions and its immediate connection to the 'Nordic Noir' phenomenon and its rise as a separate genre.",1531785600,,2017,5.267080745341615

8610438,5,B00EYTDWMG,"Another top notch production from the Nordic Noir label, on par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bron-Broen-The-Bridge/dp/B00GTKYHSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bron/Broen (The Bridge)</a>. In contrast to The Bridge, The Killing excels at casting doubt on nearly every character introduced, to the point where the only person you are sure didn't commit the murder is Sarah Lund, the protagonist.
Bemusement reigns over not only the murder, but also other plotlines like the source of leaks in a political party (season 1). Starring Sofie Grbl, the acting is to be commended for nearly everyone involved. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic; less gritty than Bron/Broen, but capturing more color, vitality, and emotion.

I had no idea there was an American remake of this series until just now when I read another review posted here. I can't imagine it being better than the original, but since ""for some reason [Americans] cannot read subtitles, or they don't want to"" (not my words, but Sofie Grbl's), it exists if you really can't abide subtitles.

My only complaint about Forbrydelsen, and it is extremely minor: episodes begin with a recap lasting ~2.5 minutes. Do Danes have poor memories?

This box set of prototypical Danish programming is highly recommended, and it's as good a place to start as any if you are new to Nordic Noir serials.",1439683200,2,1399,5.55868544600939
8610439,5,B00EYTDWMG,"""The Killing Trilogy"" is the original Danish TV series (Forbrydelsen in Danish) on which the American series (The Killing) is based.  I liked the American series quite a lot, and indeed have reviewed it here on Amazon Prime, but I like the Danish original better.  The Danish characters are somewhat more appealing to me and the original story is full of less of the unlikely interconnections between the characters which (in retrospect) pepper the American version.  In other words, it makes somewhat more sense.  Plus, the Danish version gives you more of that ""Millennium Trilogy"" feel, if you like that kind of thing.  :-)  Though I admit that the American version is certainly good enough for most of us Americans, and that the American version will be more accessible to most of us.  Personally, I'm of the view that if the original was great, the fact that it's foreign isn't really a good justification for making a whole new version that probably won't be as good, so I highly recommend the Danish version for anyone of that same point of view.

Actually, I think the comparison with Millennium is apt in quite a few ways, not merely because the same sensibilities and (from an American point of view) locales apply, but because the central character is a very strong female, who is both somewhat appealing, but at the same time so intensely focused and in a sense anti-social that she triggers a lot of intense negative reactions to her by the other characters she interacts with.

This was very tricky to find, because if you search on Amazon for Forbrydelsen, all you find is used copies from Japan that cost $100/season and up, and if you search for ""The Killing"" you get primarily hits for the American series.  Nevertheless, ""The Killing Trilogy"" is in fact the Danish series, and at $60 (or whatever it was) for the complete set, it's quite a bargain, comparatively speaking.  One caution is that it is packaged for the U.K., and therefore the DVDs are encoded for Region 2.  So if you're in the U.S., and therefore encoded for region 1, you have to have a region-free player or some appropriate software to view it.",1438819200,4,2132,4.732432432432432
