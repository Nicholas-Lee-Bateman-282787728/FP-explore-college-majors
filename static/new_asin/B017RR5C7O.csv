7512788,3,B017RR5C7O,"The actors in this movie were all superb, not just Ellen Page and Julianne Moore, but unfortunately I found the story, while true, to be just built around way too many cliches; LGBT community, police officers, politicians and activists were written so stereotypically, it was almost hard to believe that it was a true story and IMO, that didn't bode well for this movie.
Nevertheless , if one can get past all of those awful cliches, it's a heartfelt and heartbreaking story.",1453507200,6,475,4.804878048780488

Critics are really hating on this fact-based drama about terminally ill New Jersey detective Laurel Hester (Julianne Moore) who fought for the right (circa 2005) to leave her police pension to her registered domestic partner (Ellen Page) after her death.  Admittedly, I took one look at the casting and thought they were an odd couple and quickly disregarded it... and one more LGBT movie where the lesbian dies in the end just didn't get me excited at all.

And then I ended up watching it by chance anyway and was pleasantly surprised on a number of levels.  The first being that Julianne Moore and Ellen Paige actually did have some nice chemistry.  Their performances and chemistry totally made this movie.  I initially thought the younger Stacie Andree character should have been played by a much more butch woman as the woman is in real life (Hollywood isn't ready for real butches as yet, I guess).  Ellen Paige looks like a cutie little baby dyke here lol.  Julianne Moore reminds me of a very dykey looking older Madonna (not a complaint).  There's supposed to be a nearly 20 yr age-gap between them, and I think something adorable came out of this in their chemistry... there's a bit of mommy/feisty little girl energy goin' on, heh.  And someone who actually knows lesbians dressed them, lol.

Sure it was predictable.  It might even feel kinda outdated. The villains are all cardboard.  Behavior is rather stereotypical.  The second half has some dreary cancer stuff and Steve Carell (who I love anyway) is some caricature diva activist who whirls in for lots of feel-good moments.  I get it has its shortcomings.  It even lives in the shadow of a 2007 award-winning 40 min. documentary of the same name (which focuses on the activism around their case).  You might even call this a glorified Lifetime Movie Network flick.

But here's the thing.... I LOVE me a good melodramatic LMN flick!!!  LOL.  So f*** the bad reviews and critics... I really liked it.  I would recommend it for the first 40 minutes alone as the first half is a very warm romantic drama and takes the time to show these two in a very loving relationship and building a life together.  The second half turned it into a real tear-jerker... but there is a great deal of satisfaction that these guys are not fighting in vain and this aspect of the film is very uplifting.  It's a bittersweet ending.  But it's the first half of the movie that really won me over and makes it a more preferable watch (for me) as compared to the documentary (which I've also seen)...  the film goes back to 2002 and allows their life to be shown in a more balanced way without the specter of cancer on screen 100% and we see Laurel when she's a vulnerable closet case and not just fighting bravely while ill.  So it's just not so depressing and all about activism.

I say give it a chance before you judge.  People want it to be as deep and as serious as the documentary from which it is based... but I think the movie got its point across and was surprisingly engaging and emotional to boot.  This is no Jenny's Wedding lol.  The star power here did wonders for this average script (which was written by Ron Nyswaner who also did Philadelphia and seems to have left his queer mojo back in 1993).",1453420800,22,3267,4.592400690846286
7512791,5,B017RR5C7O,"Rather or not you agree with the subject matter, this movie was wonderful. Julianne Moore and Ellen Page were so amazing and anything less than 5 stars means you were not paying attention.",1453161600,,188,4.7272727272727275
7512792,2,B017RR5C7O,"The true story at the heart of Laurel Hester and Staciee Andree, chronicled previously in Cynthia Wade's inspiring 2007 documentary Freeheld: The Laurel Hester Story, makes an indisputable case for marriage equality in this country. That film worked on a number of levels, serving to fire up audiences at the mistreatment of two women whose love is treated as secondary to traditional unions. A lot has changed in the years since; the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ruling has leveled the playing field on a national scale, and sadly takes some of the fire out of Peter Sollett's well-meaning narrative drama. If poor timing were the only problem plaguing Freeheld it could be easily overcome, but it's actually in the transition from documentary to Hollywood feature that it loses a great deal of steam.

As previously stated, Hester (Julianne Moore) and Andree's (Ellen Page) story isn't without its share of thrills, miscarriages of justice, and outright denial of the basic human right to love who one wants. The problem is that Ron Nyswaner's screenplay goes out of its way to make their situation as average as people. It doesn't help that the central characters come across as unexciting, and their courtroom battles with New Jersey's Board of Chosen Freeholders isn't much better.

What saves the film somewhat are the lead performances by Moore and Page, the latter having put a lot of herself into bringing this story to the big screen. Hester is a tough-as-nails New Jersey cop keeping her sexuality tucked away in the closet, even from her loyal partner Dane Wells (Michael Shannon, purely in good guy mode) who may have a slight crush.  Because she has to hide so much of herself, Hester is essentially a loner until she meets up with the tomboyish Andree while playing volleyball. Despite the vast age difference, the two hit it off and soon settle into common domestic bliss. House with a garden, a dog, and bland everyday relationship troubles. Much of the film goes by without any kind of tension until a doctor's phone call reveals Hester's terminal cancer diagnosis, and even that goes by without causing much of a stir.

The second half of the film is where the conflict finally arises, as Hester battles with the board of Freeholders (Josh Charles plays one) to make sure her pension goes to Andree after her death. Despite state law allowing for that to happen, the conservative board rejects it so as not to rile up their base of supporters who don't care much for the gays. These encounters, mostly taking place in a tiny courtroom, hold little drama except for the pang of sadness you'll feel at watching Hester deteriorate. But there's also triumph in her defiant stance to make sure the woman she loves is cared for and protected after she's gone.

Moore, who won an Oscar for playing an ill woman in Still Alice, is once again the film's driving force. Page is solid in a role that doesn't require her to do much but stay on the sidelines and occasionally show signs of anguish. Steve Carell blows in like a tornado as Steven Goldstein, the wildly flamboyant head of an LGBT group supporting Hester's cause. It's possible that Goldstein is every bit as animated as he's portrayed in the film, but the moment Carell shows up it's like he walked in from some cheap Lifetime movie. Too much of Freeheld plays like a cinematic Wikipedia entry, minus any kind of drama. The struggle for any biopic is to remain true to the story while adding the creative flourish that every feature film needs, and Freeheld, despite its good intentions, never manages to do that.",1448323200,12,3589,4.819805194805195

It really made me very sad for the two, as this is based on a true story. I never saw this as a gay issue, merely doing what is right, moral and just. The sad disgraceful fact that the real Laurel had to fight so hard for what she was entitled to while fighting for her life broke my heart. I am so relieved that the right decision was made. Their story is an inspiration to all, but I sure wish she was still here. It was SOOOOOO wrong of the town council to treat her in that manner, because of her sexual orientation- thank goodness they came to their senses.

7512887,5,B017RR5C7O,"It was a huge excitement seeing two great actress meet from one single movie.
Julianne Moore+Ellen Page. And the director Peter Sollett who already became the great melodrama artist with <Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist ><Raising Victor Vargas> and this is his third and atmost sad tear dropping but something I personally love the most.
You better need some handkerchief if you are a romantist.
Yes it's a lesbian love story. But who carese as long as it is a pure love and a powerful true love story?
I love all kinds of love story and this one is the atmost unique one since it doesn't have any nudity. It's got so many romantic shots with really good camera angles and mis-en-scenes.
Also the fact that Julianne Moore is a tough cop really worked that she is a bit old but cool for the roll. She sure was a cameleon.
She can do any roll any roll for sure!!
Ellen Page a bid aged from the moment we saw her at the beginning now that she is a woman, she was perfect for the roll.
A creature that doesn't want to be bothered by the public. Who deosn't give a damn to receive any money from her lover but just want to support her lover a dying lover that she has been working for the police all her life and now that she is dying she is about to lost all her pension because her partner is not a man so they are not married?
Damn the society!

And then there is this great great actor Michael Shannon a guy everyone will fall in love. The one who supports Julianne Moore as a police officer partner all the way.
A true male figure a true justice a true human being.

Then there is this quircky guy Steve Carell a gay priest who also supports Julianne in a strange but powerful way.

And I shouldn't forger the hidden pleasure Josh Charles another good guy who is also a great actor in this movie.

If you want all the detailed Political movie, maybe you will not like this film and give it a 90/100 for this one but if you are a bit romantist you will give it a two thumbs way up",1472688000,,1982,4.194225721784777

7512937,5,B017RR5C7O,"FREEHELD is a film that matters, a well acted and directed paean to a real life story of a lesbian couple and their fight for equal rights. Writer Ron Nyswander (The Painted Veil, Philadelphia, Soldiers Girl), Homeland, Ray Donavan, etc) and director Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas) have transformed the Oscar winning documentary into a deeply moving cry for equality for LGBT citizens. The film is made more worthy by the intensely dramatic performances by Julianne Moore, Ellen Page, Michael Shannon and Steve Carell and a supporting cast that is spot on.

This is first and foremost a love story between New Jersey police lieutenant Laurel Hester (Julianne Moore) and her younger somewhat pugnacious domestic partner Stacie Andree (Ellen Page). We witness Laurels fine performance as a policeman who meets Stacie at a volleyball match and their love develops into a lasting one: their register as Domestic Partners. Laurel develops lung cancer, Stage 4, and must endure chemo and radiotherapy. Concerned about Stacie and the house they have reconstructed together, Laurel seeks her pension to be given to Stacie when the cancer wins. However the county officials, Freeholders, conspire to prevent Laurel from doing this. Hard-nosed detective and Laurels work partner  Dane Wells [Michael Shannon), and gay activist Steven Goldstein (Steve Carell), unite in Laurel and Stacie's defense, rallying police officers and ordinary citizens to support their struggle for equality.

At times the script becomes overly saccharine but because of the performances by the four leads the story hits you in the gut and the heart. It is a deeply moving film and one that deserves wide attention, especially during this time when the struggle for gay rights is changing the public perception of equality.

So it was nice to see a movie explore the entirety of a love story, not just the bad, or just the good, but the whole thing. The struggle to hide is very real, even in 2016. I can't be open at my place of employment because it's frowned upon, but that doesn't change who I am. Kudos to the people who capture this. Much love to the ladies who made this movie possible.

7512971,4,B017RR5C7O,"Possible spoilers.  Director Peter Sollett certainly shifts gears after his last film, Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist with this true story of equality and fairness.  Hes aided by screenwriter, Ron Nyswaner whose first script (Philadelphia) got him an Oscar nod.  Laurel Hester (Julianne Moore, Still Alice) is a 40-something New Jersey detective who has 23 years on the force and partners with Dane Wells (Michael Shannon, The Iceman).  Laurel is a tightly closeted lesbian given her profession and the era (mid-2000s).  Even Dane doesnt know.

Needing a change, she signs up for a volleyball team.  Shes not very good but meets one of the other players, Stacie Andree (Ellen Page, Juno).  They become close even with their age difference and eventually become legal domestic partners and buy a house together.  When Laurel becomes seriously ill with a fast growing cancer, she applies to have her police pension go to Stacie.  Under the law at the time, the decision must come from the county freeholders, their term for councilmen.  Basically the 5 straight white men run the county government.  They vote no.

Laurel begins a campaign, supported by Dane, a newspaper reporter and a Jewish gay man, Steven Goldstein (Steve Carell).  Not only is Carell miscast in this role but Goldstein becomes a shocking addition, a stark shift from the quiet sensibilities of Laurel, Stacie, Dane and their internal support group.  Hes loud, obnoxious and has his own agenda - gay marriage.  Laurels fight is for equal treatment.  She doesnt have time to fight for the marriage component.

Eventually, the freemen come to their senses especially after some are exposed for having more than one government pension coming.  Sollett can be criticized for his casting choice of Carell, but Page, Moore and Shannon are terrific.  I would have liked to see a bit more of Stacie and a lot less of Goldstein.  And yes, the film manipulates the audiences emotions and has a clear, one-sided viewpoint.  Fortunately it is the right side.

The Blu ray disc comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The transfer is excellent.  Shot with digital cameras, the movie has a very natural look to it.  Moores numerous freckles are clearly visible as well as a few wrinkles.  Kudos to the films makeup department for transforming Laurel as she begins to show the clear signs of the advancing cancer.  The film doesnt explode with color but that is certainly appropriate for the story.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and is also very good.  It doesnt overextend the dynamics and is focused primarily on the dialog up front.  A few scenes (beach, dance hall) give the surrounds an opportunity to quietly sound off, and the violin-laden score is well placed.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with Sollett, Moore and Page, a making of piece, and some interviews including the real Stacie.  Finally, there is the Oscar winning Freeheld documentary short thats worth a look.",1460505600,,3025,4.972055888223553

It is a true story with little fictionalization and features a cast of powerful actresses, actors, and supporting film makers.  While the subject matter involves two women who happen to be gay and are discriminated against because of it, it is not a film about gay rights activists or preaching.  Rather it is a film about two ordinary people who only want to live a quiet life in a small community going to their jobs every day to serve that community.  They do very ordinary things like buying a small fixer upper house that was all they could afford by combining their incomes and then  repairing it with their sweat equity, buying a nice dog and trying to live their lives like everyone else.  One of them, Laurel, is a decorated police detective who has literally put her life on the line every day for the past 24 years fighting organized crime groups in Ocean County, New Jersey (in real life she was the first female police lieutenant in that county police force, but it is only her rank and not her law enforcement work that was adjusted for the movie).  During that time she had never asked for anything for herself - she only worked to serve the people in the County and uphold its laws for them.  Her partner, Stacie, was a woman who was a skilled auto mechanic who worked long hours every day in a small local auto shop fixing cars for people in the community.  The story begins as a simple love story where they meet and fall in love, then develops to portray how police detective Laurel developed terminal lung cancer.  Her partner Stacie stayed by her side which does not always happen with other couples including straight couples.  Then it moves into how Laurel made her only request ever to the County's five elected officials (called Freeholders) which was to use existing New Jersey State laws that allowed her pension benefits to go to her legally established partner, Stacie.  While gay rights activists tried to use Laurel's case to advocate and march for marriage rights, Laurel refused and only asked the Freeholders for what was right and just under the law.  The story goes into the Freeholders' refusal and the extended drama around what followed.  During this time, Laurel wound up fighting for her last request while she was also fighting for her life as her terminal cancer progressed relentlessly.  This true story was the basis for the eventual passage in New Jersey of the right to gay marriage, and was one of the cases that built towards the recent US Supreme Court ruling for gay marriage across the country.

Laurel is played by Julianne Moore who is scary talented and delivers a spellbinding performance in this film, especially since she is straight in her personal life with a beautiful children and husband.  Julianne won the Academy Award the previous year and has four previous Academy Award nominations.  Laurel's partner Stacie is portrayed by Ellen Page who is an exceptional actress as well with an Academy Award nomination for her starring role in the film Juno.  The film also features Steve Carrel who has an Academy Award nomination for his earlier role in the film Foxcatcher, and Michael Shannon has an Academy Award nomination for his role in Revolutionary Road.  The screenplay is by Ron Nyswaner who won an Academy Award nomination for the film Philadelphia, the musical score is by Hans Zimmer who won the Academy Award for the Lion King.  There is a beautiful and haunting song at the end of the film that was composed by Linda Perry and performed by Miley Cyrus in which Miley surprised me with her quality of singing that goes far beyond her normal pop rock tunes - she is truly talented.

And on top of all of this this DVD includes as a special bonus a copy of the original documentary on this story that won the Academy Award in 2008 for short documentary.  This exceptional documentary by itself would be worth the cost of the DVD.

This DVD is worth buying, watching and sharing with others.",1457222400,12,4004,4.662873399715505

----------------------------------------------------
Based on a powerful 2007 documentary, this quiet docudrama tells the story of a veteran police officer Laurel Hester (played by Julianne Moore) and her domestic partner, Stacie Andree (portrayed by Ellen Page) who were caught up in a struggle with local officials in a New Jersey county who refused to extend pension benefits to a same-sex couple, in the years before legalized marriage.

The DVD/BluRay packages both include the original documentary, though the dramatization is particularly moving - both Moore and Page are excellent in their roles, and in the early scenes when they are courting they share tremendous chemistry.  The ever stone-faced Michael Shannon adds an additional emotional layer as Hester's partner, a heterosexual cop who has no problem sticking up for his friend when the local ""freeholders"" (basically county commissioners) deny her justice.

This movie was been criticized for being too conventional and cliched, but those craving an edgier or more multi-layered presentation may be underestimating the power of an understated, easily digestible narrative, one that portrays the couple in the same terms that they described themselves -- as normal, average citizens who deserve fair and equal treatment under the law.  The unabashedly sentimental script is simple, clean and effective, bolstered by powerful performances -- Ellen Page in particular shines as Hester's soft-spoken, down-to-earth partner, and the inclusion of the original documentary, with footage of the real-life versions of several principal characters, provides a fascinating opportunity to see just how good a job each of the actors did.

It's also fascinating how quickly this issue has been resolved in American public life -- within a year of Ms. Hester's death, the state of New Jersey mandated full equality of all its citizens, and in 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. This story, on the forefront of a bitter civil rights struggle, took place barely a decade ago, and already has a feel of ancient, almost inexplicable, history. And yet, you can see how the tides shifted, right then and there, as average citizens of all different backgrounds and persuasions came together in a consensus that justice was being denied, and that this was a wrong that had to be righted. This is a movie that will hold its appeal for years to come -- it captures and crystallizes the essence of a profound political and social struggle, and shows how the American public rapidly changed its mind, and why. Sentimental, yes, but thoughtful and well-produced as well. Recommended. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1455580800,2,2751,5.403263403263403

7513130,4,B017RR5C7O,"This a little movie where if you stick with it, it gets better and better after the first act. Freeheld is VERY impactful and it is shocking to think that the events in the film only occurred about ten years ago. The film made us think a lot about where our country has come in such a short amount of time and how small-minded many of us were back then.

While the movie is a tear~jerker and pulls you into the story, characters well... there are a few weaknesses. Ellen Page is to be commended on getting this movie made for sure, but she still looks way too young and slight for the role. But, the story pulls you past it. Also, there are a few holes in the first act regarding the timeline that take you out of Freeheld for a little while. Julianne Moore makes you forget the distractions and give your attention to what is really unfolding on the screen.

We could've done without Steve Carell's campy acting at times, but his flaming character totally contrasted the two brave women whose story is Freeheld. How the Marriage Movement might ""use"" these women at a precarious time was a very refreshing storyline.

The pre-eminent Gay Rights court drama movie will always be PHILADELPHIA, but that was a fictional script coming at the right time. FREEHELD is based on a true story and comes after Marriage for All is the law of the land. Keep your Oscar expectations low and you'll be rewarded by this film.

7513275,2,B017RR5C7O,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There are some great things to consider with the movie FREEHELD. Before delving into that one thing needs to be noted. There will be many who will be turned off by this film early on. Some will call those people homophobes when it truth that isn't the case. We live in a world where homosexuality has been ingrained in most of us as being wrong. But times are changing. Everyone doesnt have to endorse that times are changing but we will need to accept that they are. So consider watching this film as if it weren't about that aspect but about two people in love. If you do so then the cause being discussed becomes the issue as it should be.

FREEHELD tells the true story of Laurel Hester (Julianne Moore). Laurel is a police detective working her way to becoming a lieutenant. Her partner Dane Wells (Michael Shannon) is her closest friend on the force. But even Dane is unaware of the fact that Laurel is a lesbian. Its a secret she holds for fear of having it be used against her at work.

Laurel meets Stacie Andree (Ellen Page), a much younger lesbian, at a gay bar in a nearby town. The two find themselves attracted to one another and soon a romance blooms. While Laurel continues to try and hide this from her co-workers, they eventually move in together. A surprise visit from Dane at their home results in his discovering Laurels big secret. The surprise is on Laurel though as Dane is accepting of the fact but hurt that she didn't trust him enough to tell him.

Problems ensue when Laurel begins having pains in her side. Stacie demands that she see a doctor and the result is discovering that she has stage four cancer. She begins treatment but the odds of survival are very slim with only 10% of most victims of this cancer surviving. The cancer takes its toll on Laurel but it is a different opponent that is causing her more grief.

The city where Laurel works is governed by freeholders, an elected group of country members that govern some cities in New Jersey. Having gone through domestic partnership proceedings and completing that agreement, Laurel now asks that her pension benefits be passed on to Stacie. But the group of freeholders turn down her request citing that what she has is not a legal marriage and that they are not legally required to do so even if the state recognizes domestic partnerships.

What follows is the Laurel and Stacies battle for the rights guaranteed her by the state. Into the mix falls Dane who supports his partner much to the chagrin of the rest of the police force who don't seem willing to back her. When their pleas fall on deaf ears Laurel received a call from Steven Goldstein (Steve Carrell), the founder of Garden State Equality, an organization focusing on LGBT rights. Steven tells Laurel he will take on her case and help her to the fullest extent possible. Only time will tell what happens in the end, time that Laurel doesnt have as the cancer progresses.

While this is the story being told the question boils down to is this a good movie or not, something worth watching? There are two things to discuss to answer that question: does it convince you to consider its cause and is it a good movie. Unfortunately I found it to achieve neither while only slightly helping the cause.

How so? Well lets look at the movie first. While it is well acted it comes off more as a disease of the week film that was prevalent in the late seventies on TV. We get to see the short romance followed by the debilitating disease followed by the court like drama. But the writing is poor here. Things feel contrived, situations don't seem to seamlessly combine to tell a story and the dialogue is extremely lacking in many parts. And while Moore is an accomplished actress she doesnt seem at ease here with the role. Page has shown potential in so many movies but here seems like she holds back far too much. Only Shannon comes off good in this film and his part is very supporting. Carrell is perhaps the worst here but I don't think he is to blame. His portrayal of Goldstein makes the man seem more sideshow barker willing to use anyone he can to promote gay marriage while Laurel just wants equal treatment.

That becomes one of the issues that do more damage than good when it comes to looking at the cause being discussed. While the disagreement with same sex marriage is discussed those who disagree with it here are portrayed fairly, showing how some are too caught up in their religious feelings on the issue when they should be looking at it from a legal standpoint. It is those who are for gay marriage that come off the worst here, portrayed as a yelling mob that chants one or two slogans without providing any insight as to why they feel they should be recognized. It would have been more convincing had they done so.

In the end it is the last few moments of the film that make the subject matter more relatable for viewers. It is the battle seen through the eyes of Laurel and Stacie that is the heart of the matter, their search for nothing more than to be treated equally. Their story isn't about a quest for gay marriage or street protests or getting on TV but about just being accepted for who they are. That comes through near the end but not enough to save this movie from what has come earlier.

I have little doubt that this movie will find many supporters who will love it not for the quality of the film itself but because of its cause. That cause does indeed deserve attention and discussion. What happened to Laurel Hester is terrible and should be brought to everyones attention. But this film doesnt truly do the cause justice. In the end those who are offended will stop watching early on during love scenes and never get to the important part of the film. Those who view it as only a cause will delight in the chanting Carrells character does even though he seems cartoonish here. But for those who sympathize with the plight these two women went through a better movie could and should have been made.",1454630400,,6043,4.499544211485871

Laurel Hester (Moore) is a detective in New Jersey and is one of the best at what she does. She also has a secret she is trying to keep hidden. When she meets Stacie (Page) she is happier than she has ever been and little by little opens up. When she is diagnosed with cancer the only thing Laurel wants is to leave her pension to Stacie, but the state won't allow it. Laurel now is not only fighting for her life, but the future of Stacie's as well. This is one fantastic movie. A movie that keeps you engrossed, interested and furious all at the same time. The fact that this is a true story makes the entire thing more infuriating. The movie really shows why any objection to gay equality is ridiculous doesn't help anyone. It also shows the real reason why many officials didn't want it to happen, and it's more selfish than I expected, and that's saying a lot. I don't want this to become political but I will just say watch this and make your own decision about it. I will say I loved it and highly recommend it. Overall, a movie that is entertaining to watch as well as continues and important conversation. One of the best movies of the year. I give this an A+.",1454112000,11,1311,4.399176954732511

When this movie is over you will be proud of the characters and terribly sad for Ellen Page's character.  Ellen, Julianne, Steve and Michael (the main characters) were superb,  The supporting cast were OK, but not great.  You will like, perhaps even love this movie, but I am not sure you will be entertained.  I guess that depends how much you like crying.",1453680000,2,488,4.318681318681318

8740093,5,B017RR5C7O,"Actually only watched this movie because I had nothing else around: Google search had brought up low star reviews.  Also I hate propaganda movies about this issue. However, I was very surprised how much I liked the movie.  Acting is very true to life (the couple is not made to please sensibilities). The documentary is powerful.

The movie adds humor through Goldstein, the gay activist, which is fun.  But the real life footage of the board room scenes with the public -- all sober, all sad-faced and deadly serious -- that really moved me most and cannot be replicated.  Those county board scenes of the Freeholder ""Chosen,""  some with double pensions, meeting with the public and with Leslie and Stacie and Lane are most revealing.

""The Freeholder Chosen"" are not to be judged as some reviewers have written rather they represent the changes we all in America have gone through.  I would include gay couples in this.  No matter who we are, as we age, priorities change, different needs and challenges.  So with the LGBT movement.  It will change.  No one has a monopoly on morality.

What I like most about the film is it reveals a bit of that centrality of TIME and human growth. Very inspirational.  People and societies change over time.  Do not judge that.  Realize the necessity for that.  If it's not this issue, it will be another.

The movie is full of grace and compassion for all. Don't be quick to judge others who are going through a different process of change.  The timing is often required in order to make deep and lasting change, not just in others, but also in those who are taking the vanguard.  No one is left out of the compassion.  Stereotypes are an avoidable part of life.  What matters is facing the stereotypes and transcending them.",1507248000,,1764,4.677524429967427
