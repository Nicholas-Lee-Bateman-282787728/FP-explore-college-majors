347114,5,6301734815,"Honestly, it surprises me that this series is not more well known than some of your other yaoi alternatives. Out of all the anime I've seen (and there have been alot of them) Mirage of Blaze still strikes me as one of the most well-written and better animated ones out there.

Originally a long running manga series that is, unfortunately, only being published in Japan (as of now), Mirage of Blaze is a 13-episode series with a promised 3-episode sequal (which Amazon has already listed). At first glance, Mirage is just another supernatural anime, revolving around a team of, to put it crudely, ghost hunters. As the story progresses, however, and new characters are introduced and old ones developed, it is made clear that this isn't your run-of-the-mill anime.

For one, the story is a complex alternate history, which revolves around the reincarnations of real Japanese historical firgures from the feudal era. (Extra knowledge of this would be helpful, but one of the characters is always kind enough to explain things to you, though this can be somewhat confusing at times.) Basically, the war between these men didn't just end with their deaths, but has carried on into the present in the Feudal Underworld. The captains and warlords still battle for territory and control by taking over (posessing) human bodies.

The anime follows one of these posessors, the famous Lord Kagetora. The only hitch is, famous Lord Kagetora doesn't remember who he is. Instead, main character Takaya believes himself to be a normal teenage boy, albeit a teenage boy with a rough family life and very few real friends. Which is precisely why he's so protective of his best friend Yuzuru. When said friend begins to fall into fugue states and witness legions of undead, Takaya has no choice but to accept the help of Mysterious Stranger, Naoe, who turns out to be a posessor himself.

It is Naoe who realizes who Takaya really is. And therin lies the main conflict: Takaya doesn't want to be anyone else but himself. What follows is a gradual revealing of the inner desires and conflicts of both men, which culminates midway through the series and is never entirely resolved. (Until the sequal, presumably. Accursed cliffhangers.)

However, aside from the above stated cliffhanger, the anime is one of the best you'll ever come across. Amusing and complicated characters are plentiful, and the story and animation are near-perfect. The english dub is also one more thing worth mentioning; it's really, really good. The voice actors can be recognized almost immeadiately. More than half are from Rurouni Kenshin and InuYasha, but nearly all are really good at what they do. For once, a dub is not painful to listen to.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this anime. It's got yaoi and bishounen for the fangirls, and history and violence for everyone else. Mirage is also darker and more serious than some of your fluffier yaoi titles (such as Gravitation); so in case sugar coating isn't your thing, here's something truly different.",1121817600,63,3019,4.956521739130435
347115,4,6301734815,I just love this film! Old Blue Eyes did real justice to one of the strangest and most effective Politicans to come out of the Old South.(Earl Long)I am willing to bet Bill Clinton has this film in his library.,1119139200,5,210,4.275
347116,3,6301734815,"Ron Shelton's second directorial effort (after ""Bull Durham"") falls a little flat.  You might be tempted to say that he should stick to sports films--which does seem to be his forte.  But I suspect the real problem with this film was that it was based on a memoir and was not one of Shelton's original scripts.  The memoir, of course, was that of legendary exotic dancer, Blaze Starr, and she not only provided the source material but served as consultant on the film and even had a cameo.  Her influence may not have been all that felicitous, however.
The hurried exposition scenes (young Blaze, nee Belle, bidding her central casting hillbilly family goodbye as she boards a bus, being introduced to the world of exotic dancing by an unscrupulous promoter played by Robert Wuhl) just don't ring true.  Belle/Blaze can't have been SO naive as to think that she was being hired to sing in a strip club.  And the scene where she and Wuhl cook up her stage name is almost painful in its cuteness. The movie stumbles badly in its introductory scenes.
It is not the fault of Lolita Davidovich, who is quite fetching in the title role, and the film does get better once Paul Newman makes his entrance as the irascible, eccentric governor of Louisiana, Earl K. Long, brother of Huey and therefore heir to a colorful tradition of populist backwoods-backroom politicking.  Newman delights in the role, and the chemistry beteen him and Davidovich is genuine.  It ratchets the film up a notch or two.
But it still never quite catches fire.  It may be that by 1989, we had already seen this type of cornpone politics on film a few too many times.  Was the real Earl K. Long as much of a progressive on the integration and voting rights issue as the film implies.  Well, this Yankee won't presume to know for sure, but within the context of the film, Long's progressivism comes off as a little cliched.  He's clearly a rascal, but he's supposed to be redeemed somewhat in the audience's eyes since he's on the right side of the race issue.  But frankly it would be a little more interesting, if he were just a little more conflicted about the racial politics of his home state.
As for the Blaze Starr character, well, as implied above, her character could be, uh, fleshed out more as well.  She has been elsewhere described as a ""stripper with a heart of gold,"" and that may well have been the case, but surely, the country gal who started out wanting to be a singer must have been more conflicted about her career path than this film ever suggests.  The only sense we get of that inner conflict, however, is her reluctance to tell her backwoods mama what she really does for a living (of course, Mama's not quite as naive and isolated as Blaze thinks: she even keeps a scrapbook of her daughter's exploits).  A more nuanced portrait might have upset the real-life Starr, however, and maybe she wouldn't have served as consultant to writer/director Shelton.
Hmmm. Maybe that would have been a good thing.",1008460800,9,2992,4.6275992438563325
347117,4,6301734815,"This movie stirred some controversy when it came out because it is based on the autobiography of Blaze Starr, and so as history it is somewhat unreliable.  But the movie works very well  on its own terms, and I believe is and was underappreciated.  Among other things, it includes another fine performance by Paul Newman, which is worth the price of admission by itself.  It is too bad that it is now out of print.  Seen as a story told through Starr's eyes, the movie works very well.  It is both poignant and funny, and tells this colorful episode of Louisiana history entertainingly (but it's not a documentary, so don't expect complete historical accuracy).  Paul Newman gives a memorable performance as Goveror Earl Long, and Lolita Davidowich and the supporting cast are also great.  The movie also has a superb soundtrack that includes Fats Domino, Hank Williams and Randy Newman.",983232000,27,887,4.866666666666666

Good soundtrack featuring Hank Williams senior I believe. The story is about a politician who falls for a table dancer. The bigots crawl out of the woodwork as Paul Newman defends black rights.

Several scenes are filmed at the LA state capitol building--one in the very corridor [or so it appears to me] that Earl's brother Huey was assassinated.

347441,4,6301734815,"This film is a fictitious story based on real people. Thus, there is little or no historical accuracy involved.  One suspects that Ms. Starr made of her relationship with the Governor rather more than actually existed.  As one who lived through the rollicking days of Earl Long, I can attest that he was an incredibly colorful character, but focusing on the Blaze Starr aspect of it is rather like writing a book about Beethoven without mentioning music.  Maybe it is, as advertised, Blaze's story (as she remembers it), but there was a lot more to Earl K. Long.

That said, it is a splendid film.  The acting, dialogue, and plot are first-rate, and the filmcraft excellent.  More than that, it captures wonderfully the ""feeling"" of Louisiana at the time.  The outdoor scenes at the Pea Patch (Earl's family farm) and at the end, with Blaze leaving the Capitol accompanied by perfectly selected music, have to grab anyone, especially a Louisiana boy many years removed.

So, watch the movie and enjoy it.  Then read about the Real Earl; Blanche, his wife, a fascinating person in her own right; Huey; and the rest of the Long dynasty.  They are every bit as interesting as the Kennedy's and way more outrageous.",1212192000,7,1211,4.778846153846154

Earl shoots his lawn mower and has sex with his boots on. Robert Wuhl's character is interesting but has a small part.

347444,5,6301734815,"To begin with, if you are looking for Mechas, CB or stuff like that etc. than you you should avoid this anime.

Also, if someone of you does not like a series that includes, in the broader sense of meaning, man to man `attractions' than you better should skip this one as well.

Well, a few words about the story:

The two main characters (protagonists) are Kagetora and Naoe. In order to understand the story, you should keep in mind that although the main story resolves in our times you will get information and `flashbacks' of earlier times as well. The reason is that:

a) Re-incarnation of souls

b) The two main protagonists used to live in feudal time-periods when war was going on and they are re-incarnated today with `new' names: Takkaya is Kagetora and Yuzuru is Naoe.

c) The war that used to be at earlier times continues still today (by psychic powers etc.).

d) War occurs in both our world and the spiritual world.

e) Power games between Clans etc.

The problem: The warriors do remember their past lives etc. but Kagetora does not (in order to fully awaken his powers he needs to remember). This will lead to an explosive mixture of `switching' emotions; for instance, you will see that Naoe loves and hates Kagetora as well (may sound confusing but when watching it you will understand. Apart from it, when watching the continuation of this series, called `Mirage of Blaze: Rebels of the River Edge OVA' you will see the reason why).

Furthermore, the story is also very character driven. It does indeed introduce you to a lot of information and various other characters but I personally believe that once you watch it you will be able to sort it out.

Unfortunately I cannot write much more about the story or otherwise I would start giving things away which could ruin the suspense when watching it (sorry guys).

As for the story it is very good, interesting, and solid with many twists. Moreover, it is very emotional and has a great character development; therefore, if you are the sensible type than prepare for an emotional rollercoaster. The series could be categorized under the genre of fantasy/action and romance.

The dub is very good as is the music as well that accompanies the story (starts with something like a rock/pop song and finishes with a melodic song); not to mention the fact that the animation is very good, too.

As for bad guys and action you will have more than enough like the Fuuma Ninjas etc.

As for extras: Well the typical stuff like trailers etc. (The second one comes with more fan service and so forth).

Additional:

The story is based on supernatural facts, believes etc. Meaning that the explanations they provide belong to the category of supernatural (something like Anthroposophy or Theosophy 'teachings' and in addition with implication of Christianity, Buddhism, exorcism and all of it combined with magic). Furthermore, the fights that take place belong to the supernatural plane as well but affect tremendously our material world. For instance, if someone sends out to kill an opponent with a psychic fireball (I apologise for the `weird' terminology that I just used) than it will hit our world like an explosion etc.

To sum up:

Is it worth buying it? My answer would be yes, the price is good, and I do recommend them. Apart from it, if you have not yet included a different show in your anime collection than this superb show is worth owning.

I hope I could help you ^_^",1153872000,16,3444,4.708333333333333
347445,5,6301734815,"Politics, scandalous affair, and sexy-what more could you want??! Seriously, I enjoyed this film alot. I did not judge this as a documentary or biography. It is noted in the credits that this is ""based on Miss Starrs memoirs"". This is a story of a poor West Virginia gal who becomes the glamorous burlesque stripper Blaze Starr and her relationship with Governor Earl Long. Lolita Davidovich does a great job as Blaze and she is very sexy! Paul Newman is awesome as Governor Earl Long. Blaze may be naive to the ways of the world but learns to look out for herself. Gov. Long is a wheeler dealer who is a smart politician and outsmarts his opponents. I thought this film was very good and enjoyed it immensely. Entertaining and well done!",1152403200,13,738,4.598484848484849
347446,1,6301734815,This anime is so so...so so so BORING! I don't have much else to say about it other than that. Except that the storyline is horrible and there are no interesting characters.,1151625600,2,173,4.4375
347447,5,6301734815,"Mirage of Blaze (Honoo no Mirage) is a four-disc show based on a series of novels of the same name by Mizuna Kuwabara. Unfortunately, the thirteen episodes only scratches the surface of Kuwabara's work: the novels number into the forties and the series is still going strong in Japan. Nevertheless, Mirage of Blaze is simply amazing. If you mix boys' love, fantasy, and Japanese history, add excellent animation, and throw in stunning voice actors, you might get this anime.

The novels lend their strong plot to the anime. In short, a battle of the feudal era is continuing to this day in another, spiritual plane, and the ringleaders on either side, called ""Possessors,"" continue said battle with spiritual, supernatural powers. The main character, a high school student by the name of Takaya Ougi, is the reincarnation of Kagetora, one the the Possessors who continues the battle across lifetimes. Unlike usual, though, Takaya doesn't recall his previous lives or anything that happened, unlike the other Possessors. So when Naoe, a fellow Possessor, comes along and explains, Takaya doesn't believe him. It turns out that Naoe and Kagetora have a rather twisted history and an equally twisted relationship, one that's stretched across four hundred years and hasn't resolved itself. And as if their relationship problems aren't enough, Takaya has to save his friend Yuzuru and continue the battle in the Feudal Underworld without even remembering anything in the first place.

Needless to say, the plot can be rather confusing at times; you have to think in order to understand this anime. Each of the Possessors has two names, the plot always has several parts to it, and you get a lesson in Japanese history that you have to remember if you want to know what's going on.

Fortunately, it's not as difficult as it could be. Whenever something starts getting confusing, someone takes the time to explain it to poor Takaya, who's often just as confused as the viewer; a few well-placed flashbacks serve to further elucidate events, both past and present. You may have to actively think while watching this, but it's not incomprehensible.

The characters are fascinating and are what truly drive the story. There's the confused but well-meaning Takaya, who's dragged unwittingly into this mess; there's Naoe, who seems to be protective but is slowly slipping into desperation and, some might say, madness. Their interactions and extremely long history are incredible to watch, especially when you see each of them struggling with themselves - Takaya with memories and feelings he should but doesn't have, Naoe with his own desires and the knowledge that Takaya doesn't know their history like he does. When you add in Yuzuru, who has some sort of power that makes him the perfect target, and the other Possessors - Nagahide, who has been dealing with the feudal battle and the other Possessors on his own terms, and Haruie, who has been in a woman's body for the past two hundred years - and throw them into the Feudal Underworld to continue the fight, it becomes truly outstanding.

The animation is top-notch. It's often in muted hues - there won't be many overly bright colours in this - but it's beautifully done. The art is vaguely CLAMP-esque, bringing the groups' series X(/1999) to mind. It's never jerky or off, and it's quite consistent. The effects used for the spiritual battles contrast nicely with the rest of the animation, but not enough to make the difference jarring.

The voice acting is also very well done. The Japanese voice actors were outstanding: Hayami Sho brought Naoe to life, while Toshihiko Seki portrayed the defiant Takaya perfectly. Surprisingly, the English dub was not terrible - while not on the same level as the Japanese voice acting, the English voice actors weren't flat and generally voiced the characters fairly well. The subtitling was not perfect, but not terrible, either.

The series spans thirteen episodes and is 300 minutes long. It is rated 13+ for homosexuality, suggested sexual themes, cigarette use and mostly bloodless violence. It also has a sequel in the OVA (original video animation) ""Mirage of Blaze: Rebels of the River Edge.""

This anime is, simply put, one of the best I've ever seen. It is fairly dark and intellectual, and the boys' love element is somewhat mild, if pervasive. I recommend it highly.",1135987200,25,4366,5.012413793103448
