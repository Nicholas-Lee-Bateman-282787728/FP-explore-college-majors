5100184,5,B007NPUW9E,Steve Mcqueen at his best!,1421884800,,26,4.4
5100185,5,B007NPUW9E,"Steve McQueen was indeed the King of Kewl and here we have three of his best movies for exercising that cool.

Bullitt which contains one of the great car chases ever filmed due in large part to the fact that McQueen was a race car driver off screen as well and did it himself.  It also is one of the best of the cop movies coming out of that era and gives Dirty Harry a 'ride' for his money.

The Cincinnati Kid pitting hungry McQueen against Edward G. Robinson's old pro in high stakes poker.  This is one of McQueen's finest roles and ranks with Newman's The Hustler easily.

And finally McQueen and Peckinpah with The Getaway.  Do I really have to say anymore?  One of the greatest and definitely the coolest action stars ever and Sam Peckinpah (hope I'm spelling that right!) the definitive macho man director in an action movie that outpaces the Indy 500.

The price is unbeatable.  The movies are cool with a capital 'C'.  So what are you waiting for if you're a McQueen fan and if you're not...buy them...watch them...and you will be.",1417219200,2,1042,4.465608465608466
5100186,5,B007NPUW9E,Perfect for any Steve McQueen fan especially in Blu-Ray,1415318400,,55,5.222222222222222
5100187,5,B007NPUW9E,"Great little gift for Dad, great movies in one package.",1409270400,,55,4.6
5100188,5,B007NPUW9E,"These are my favorite McQueen films, getting them in one dvd is the best.",1406937600,,73,4.285714285714286
5100189,1,B007NPUW9E,"A waste of money & I'd like my money back! This is not a legitimate Blu-Ray disc because the transfer is so poor that it's like viewing a decades-old VHS tape. Scene after scene in ""Bullitt"" is awful to watch  because the graininess of the images is so distracting that it's impossible to focus on the actors. It's a terrible transfer when you're watching the classic car chase in ""Bullitt"" & the image quality is so poor that you can't follow the duel on the streets between McQueen & the killers. THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF A LOUSY TRANSFER IN THE BLU-RAY FORMAT!!!

AS I WROTE ABOVE, i WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!",1406678400,8,608,4.468468468468468
5100190,5,B007NPUW9E,Classic McQueen!,1401494400,,16,7.5
5100191,5,B007NPUW9E,"Despite the disk of ""The Getaway"" as noted by the other reviewer, the menu is not in English and will be hard to figure out. Other than that problem this is a wonderful Blu-ray triple feature of some of the best from Steve McQueen. Each movie has it's own disk and the original pressing does come with a slipcover. All three movies are in Widescreen with ""The Getaway"" only in 2.4:1 Widescreen and other two 1.85:1. There is English, French and Spanish audio and subtitles along with German, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish audio and/or subtitles for ""The Cincinnati Kid.""

The quality of the movies are great and Warner did a good job on the remaster of all three films. The video quality is great on all three. The sound is pretty good in Dolby Digital 2.0 for ""Bullitt"" and DD 1.0 for the other two films. As for the extras' ""Bullitt"" has the trailer, commentary by Peter Yates, Vintage Featurette and Documentaries; for ""The Cincinnati Kid"" I haven't checked yet; for ""The Getaway"" I don't know since the menu is not English.

The movies details are as followed.
""Bullitt"" (1968/color/114mins)
-McQueen, Jacqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, Robert Duvall,  Simon Oakland, Norman Fell; Directed by Peter Yates
""The Cincinnati Kid"" (1965/color/103mins)
-McQueen, Edward G. Robinson, Ann-Margret, Karl Malden, Tuesday Weld, Rip Torn, Jack Weston; Directed by Norman Jewison
""The Getaway"" (1972/color/123mins)
-McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri, Sally Struthers; Directed by Sam Peckinpah

Overall this is a great Blu-ray triple feature if available. I did try to change the my PS3 and Blu-ray language, but ""The Getaway"" disk still shows that same language on the menu.",1376956800,4,1696,5.111913357400722
5100192,4,B007NPUW9E,"I wish I could show the Program Menu on The Getaway in just Japaneese. I tried everything to bring up the English. I could not do it.
The other two movies are fine and the movie The Getaway self is just great.",1340236800,,209,4.0
5100193,5,B007NPUW9E,"McQueen was never outclassed. He had a difficult life, but it made him a actor that could have lived the roles he played.",1478304000,,121,4.304347826086956
5100194,5,B007NPUW9E,I was afraid that the video on these wouldn't be that great. I'm glad to say that I was wrong and I'm glad I took the chance. All three are good classic movies with great picture quality and sound. Classic Steve McQueen.,1474156800,,220,4.261904761904762
