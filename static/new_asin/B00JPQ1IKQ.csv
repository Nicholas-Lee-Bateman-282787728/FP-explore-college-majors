6388483,4,B00JPQ1IKQ,"Academy Award winner Shirley Jones (Elmer Gantry) and her teenage son, David Cassidy (son of Jack Cassidy) had a successful sitcom in the early seventies as a family band in California. With Shirley playing Shirley Partridge, she captures a wholesomeness and well-rounded woman. The first episode is introduced by Johnny Cash (the man in black) to introduce the Partridge Family on a fictional television show. Shirley explains how they went from a normal California family to celebrity status in the early seventies. Shirley Partridge was widowed with five children and a mortgage to survive on in 1970. She has two teenagers, Keith (David Cassidy), and Laurie (Susan Dey from ""L.A. Law""); red-headed Danny Bonaduce is Danny Partridge (a preteen with a get rich scheme and the gumption to get his family band); and there are two younger children, Chris and Tracey (played by Jeremy and Brian Foster; and Suzanne Crough). The family is managed by Reuben Kincaid (played by Dave Madden).

This four disc DVD set covers the first two seasons. As an adult viewer, I truly appreciate the show's attempt to display an average family who becomes celebrity. The series deals with fame and fans with a soft, compassionate touch. The Partridge Family was a huge hit in the early seventies where David Cassidy himself became a teen idol in real life. The multi-colored bus was one of the show's best known features. The family deals with everyday and ordinary issues. There are great guest appearances by those who became famous later like Rob Reiner, Norman Fell, Meredith Baxter, and more. Ray Bolger (scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz) plays Shirley's father in a couple of memorable episodes.

If you loved the series whether on television in the early seventies or in syndication, you will appreciate it again here. There are no special features to this series. Sadly Dave Madden and Suzanne Crough both passed away recently. While the Partridge Family may not have actually made music, they did provide a lot of laughs. For today's audiences, they might find the Partridges to be too square in comparison to modern day celebrity families. I was surprised to realize that their music wasn't actually theirs after all these years. Still, it doesn't make me appreciate them any less as if they had done it themselves.",1434585600,,2308,4.992207792207792

8652928,3,B00JPQ1IKQ,"If your a fan of PF, your sure to love this combo pack. Though the entire series is available for a fantastic price for a few bucks more. The only drawback is this and the complete series with all 96 episodes is not a Sony/Columbia release. This is Mill Creek. The individual seasons produced by Sony with the extras are no longer in print, and those availiable are on the used market. Look hard, and you may a new old stock copy. The Sony discs are desireable and you know you are getting the best source. The Mill Creek transfers are good, but this offerring is bare bones. One major drawback is the packaging. A standard DVD case with a modified spindle to hold the discs. The discs are stacked on top of each other with no protection in between. There are no extras or the ability to jump to song performances like on the Sony release. In all, the Mill Creek offering isn't bad. At least it is still availiable for now and of good quality. Though to be honest, if you are a huge fan. Hunt down the original Sony season sets.",1456531200,2,1028,4.304123711340206
