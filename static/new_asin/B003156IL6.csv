8386675,5,B003156IL6,"A great film with a 'Boys' Own' exciting with a final climactic scene.  Rooney is ideal in his role and the story rolls along with great characterisations of the main actors.  The boxing scenes are well acted and belivable, the last fight really gets the heart thumping.  Well worth the money to buy this DVD.",1431129600,2,309,4.581818181818182

8386677,5,B003156IL6,"Mickey Rooney's first adult film role.  Rooney is excellent as a prize fighter on the way up.  Ann Blyth and Brian Donlevy are very good as the girl
he loves and her gambler father.  James Dunn is absolutely great as Rooney's  alcoholic father and ""dream-world"" excapist.  Very well-done on all
levels.  Incidently, Rooney ""cut-the-mustard"" and proved himself completely adept in adult roles.",1425772800,,392,5.241935483870968

8386679,5,B003156IL6,"I first saw this movie in the 1950s as a teenager.  I recall liking it.  Because of Rooney's passing it was recently shown again on TCM.  I liked it even more.  Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful performance as a street wise kid turned boxer.  The plot is OK, but it's Rooney that carries it the whole way with verve and vulnerability -- with fine performances by Donlevy and Blyth.

It's is seldom that an actor can do both comedy and drama and excel at both -- from Andy Hardy to Killer McCoy.  Rooney was such an actor.",1397433600,3,519,4.288659793814433

The DVD doesn't really have any perks or special additions other than the movie trailers I think (it's been a while since I messed with the DVD to be honest).  This review is more for the great movie than the product.

As a Rooney fan, I'm always seeking out his movies, especially his earlier works in the 30's, 40's and 50's.  This one does not disappoint.  I know it's one of the rare roles where he actually played an adult, leading male and they made no point to mask his small stature.  In fact, it's focused on in this film since he's placed in the feather weight category of boxing.

The movie starts off with Rooney going through his day-to-day tasks of earning a living - selling papers, hustling at the pool hall, helping his mother with her home laundry business.  It's apparent he does all he can to help out his family, especially since his vaudeville father is too caught up in reminiscing about his glory days in the theater to take any old job, leaving his son and wife to pick up his slack.  When he hears about an opportunity to preform, he jumps at the chance dragging his son unwillingly into the act as well.

I was embarrassed for Rooney's character as he and his father preformed - clearly it was something they did when he was much younger.  But his manhood is reclaimed at the opportunity to fight a guy he had earlier beef with in the movie at the charity event for the church.  He ends up impressing onlookers with his scrappy boxing skills, gaining the attention of a professional boxer, eager to train him and get him a start in the field.

As the story progresses, you see McCoy rise to fame as a boxer, but not without his share of bumps in the road.  He has tough breaks, falling outs, and heartbreaking results from tough decisions he had to make in his rising career.  One of those decisions resulting in his ""Killer McCoy"" nickname was particularly heart wrenching.  Imagine being branded with a name that made you famous, but also cost you dearly to earn.

He ends up falling for the daughter of the man he works for, which has it's own share of hardships.  It's frustrating to see something good finally happen for him only prove to be another mountain to climb.  I love when Rooney stands up to the man about seeing his daughter with a ""Oh, I'm good enough to earn you money, but not good enough to date your daughter"" (something along those lines...)  That part of this movie really stuck with me.  I don't want to tell you how the story ends exactly, but as with most boxing movies, he gets the stuffing beat out of him until you think all is lost...  Don't worry, McCoy gets the girl in the end - and isn't that what truely matters? :)

I'm not a big fan of the sport boxing, but for some reason I love boxing movies; they're always so dramatic!  So boxing fans, drama fans, Rooney fans, or just plain movie fans will enjoy this.  I find myself counting this among one of my favorite Rooney films.",1359417600,4,3010,4.399638336347197
