2111300,3,B0002O7Y8U,I purchased this Dvd for my mom who loves this sitcom and was excited to see it on dvd she loved watching it. I however was disappointed that a few of the episodes on the 2nd dvd froze completely and could not be viewed other than  that my mom was happy and thats all i wanted.,1459123200,,277,3.9464285714285716
2111301,5,B0002O7Y8U,"In the pantheon of black sitcoms, 227 wasn't as upscale as THE JEFFERSONS nor as bleak as GOOD TIMES, and while it never attained the blockbuster ratings of THE COSBY SHOW, when paired with fellow upstart THE GOLDEN GIRLS on NBC Saturdays in 1985, it helped the network score Neilsen gold for the evening and has gone on to a moderately successful syndication run appearing on a half-dozen national cable outlets off and on for the past quarter-century. Most sitcoms take a season or two to work out the kinks, but 227 seems to be running on all cylinders from the get-go.

Having just revisited the firstand sadly only available--season on DVD I have to say this show holds up better than I remember it (which is a rarity all too often) with solid and funny scripts, broad but consistent characterization and a talented, underrated cast that keeps one coming back for more.

Fresh off an 11-year stint as maid Florence on THE JEFFERSONS, Marla Gibbs basically sidesteps here into her own show in the Louise role as housewife/mother Mary Jenkins, raising her teenage daughter Brenda (Regina King) in their middle-class Washington D.C. apartment building with construction worker husband Lester (the dependable Hal Williams). While the couple frequently chide each other, there is obvious love and respect between the two and thankfully none of the acidic barbs or lewd banter that couples on modern sitcoms engage in.

Mary saves those barbs for the building hussy Sondra Clark (She makes me sick!) played by the inimitable Jackee Harry who deservedly won an Emmy for her role here and steals every scene shes in. With her sexy wiggle, pouty expressions and girlish squeals, Sondra is easily one of TVs all-time best divas, alongside Suzanne Sugarbaker, Blanche Devereaux and Karen Walker.

Keeping peace between these two is landlady and Marys best friend Rose Holloway (Alaina Reed Hall) whose role isn't as flashy as Jackees or sarcastic as Marlas but she does a fine job.

Another source of big laughs comes from outspoken senior citizen Pearl Shay (Helen Martin) who sits in her window, taking in all the sights and sounds of 227 and as a result is the go-to woman for all of the buildings gossip. Pearls tongue is sharp as a razor and shes not one to hold back (shes like the black version of Sophia Petrillo, but funnier IMO).

Though it aired during the apex of the pastels-and-hair-gel era, this first season of 227 surprisingly doesnt scream mid-80s aside from Brendas occasional references to musical acts such as Prince, Sheila E. or Michael Jackson, DYNASTY, or the Madonna-like makeover she gets from Sondra when trying to change her image.

One of the bonuses of viewing these old shows is seeing which guest stars will turn up, and here we get a brief glimpse of a young Fran Drescher as Sondras boss as well as an all-too-short turn from Lawanda Page in the lottery episode.

Well worth revisiting, the only complaint I have about 227: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is that it leaves you wanting more, and sadly, thanks to Sonys abandonment of the show, there is no more to be had. On a closing note, if there was an award for best TV theme song sung by its leading lady, Marla Gibbs would take best honors for 227s catchy tune. FIVE STARS.",1454371200,,3253,4.786096256684492
2111302,5,B0002O7Y8U,"Great show but just have one pressing question WHERE THE HECK ARE THE OTHER SEASONS?????????? This was released 12 years ago what happened to the others? If studios release one season why is so hard to get the rest of them out there? And yes the sequence is out of order. When  this show first aired  the episode called "" honesty"" was the first episode to air in Sept. 1985. The "" pilot "" and "" sidewalk sale "" were back to back episodes that aired later that season.",1451433600,,467,4.235955056179775

What I hope is that they release the other seasons. If they can put reality shows on DVD, which cater to a smaller group, they can certainly invest in this.",1361318400,,513,4.278350515463917

2111348,3,B0002O7Y8U,"I will echo the praise of other reviewers here for this show.  It's one of my favorite sitcoms from the mid to late 80s.  The casting is perfect, the stories well written.  Marla Gibbs and Jackee Harry are a joy to watch.

The reason I'm giving this dvd only three stars is because the episode sequencing on the set is the worst I've ever seen.  Instead of following the airing order, which is the way the show should be viewed, I think they followed the production order.  What this means is that after watching the pilot episode on disc one you will have to go to another disc to watch the second part of that story.  They do not tell you this anywhere on the set.

The proper airing order can be viewed at tv.com.  This is the way the creators of the show intended viewers to watch it.  You'll understand why once you see the sequence.  Unfortunately, to watch it the way it was meant to be watched one has to alternate back and forth between discs which can get real annoying real quick.

I'm also shocked that only the first season has been released after all this time.  Is this not selling well?  Regardless of the crazy episode sequencing this is one terrific show and I'll buy it no matter how they release it.",1199318400,31,1219,4.336283185840708
2111349,4,B0002O7Y8U,"""227"" is a prime example of classic sitcoms.  The first several seasons of this program are hilarious, this particular season probably the better.  Jackee' and Marla Gibbs had some of the best chemistry I've ever seen two people have in a sitcom. According to the studio, because the first season DVD did not sell well, there is very little chance that we will ever receive subsequent seasons on DVD so you better snap this one up while you can.",1197331200,2,445,4.620253164556962

I loved this show and I'm so glad that I can now begin adding this to my collection! The only thing that was a little annoying was during what they labled the pilot epiosde, it mentions that Rose inherits the building from her landlord who died, but the next few episodes, they make reference to him as if he was still alive. The episodes are a bit out of sequence.

On Disc three, they have a few special features one of which a ""reunion"" between Marla Gibbs, Alaina Reed-Hall and Jackee'. Although it is great to see these ladies together again, the reunion does lack a little punch.

2111354,5,B0002O7Y8U,"227: The Complete First Season is a classic series. Pull up a milk crate and take up a space on the stoop - you'll be laughing in no time.

Marla Gibbs, within a few weeks of her last performance as the smart-mouthed maid Florence on The Jeffersons, Gibbs purchased the rights to a stage play called 227, had it developed into a sitcom, and began filming the new series. In July 1985, The Jeffersons ran for the last time on CBS. Two months later, on September 14, 1985, 227 joined NBC's Saturday night lineup.

Set in Washington, DC, the series follows the residents of building number 227, a solidly middle-class apartment house located in a neighbor that is rapidly becoming gentrified with posh condominiums. Gibbs plays Mary Jenkins, a no-nonsense housewife. Mary's construction supervisor husband, Lester (Hal Williams), is a caring, dependable father to their teenage daughter, Brenda (Regina King). Mary's best friend is Rose Lee Holloway (Alaina Reed-Hall), a gossipy widow. The two pals love to sit on the stoop and discuss their lives.and the lives of anyone else who happens to wander by. Sandra Clark (Jackee Harry) is the building's resident vamp, a sashaying mantrap whose haughty attitude often sets her at odds with down-to-earth Mary. Pearl Shay (Helen Martin) is an elderly busybody who observes all of 227's comings and goings from her perch at the window of her first floor apartment. Rounding out the building's principal residents are Calvin (Curtis Baldwin), Pearl's seventeen year-old grandson (and Brenda's boyfriend), and Rose's daughter Tiffany (Kia Goodwin).

One reason that the show is so fresh is that its characters are relatively unique, especially for a show created in 1985. Rather than depicting African-Americans living in poverty (Sanford & Son, Good Times) or as nouveau riche (The Cosby Show, The Jeffersons), Gibbs developed the show, in part, because she wanted the nation's large black middle-class to be portrayed on TV. The result is that the characters and their concerns can be easily related to by a broad cross section of viewers. The show is warm and funny, with the residents of the building serving as an extended family to each other, and to its viewers.

The entire cast is strong - Gibbs especially proves her versatility by playing a character that is completely unlike snappy Florence - but Jackee Harry is the show's breakout star. She has the gift of being able to deliver even the dullest of lines in a way that provokes laughs. With her clingy dresses, mincing walk, and honey-coated buzz-saw vocal style, she manages to steal almost every scene in which she appears.

Several guest stars appear in the first season. The Naked Gun's Leslie Nielson plays a Secret Service agent who investigates Mary when she writes a ""Letter to the President."" Wrestling weirdo (and Cyndi Lauper video star) Captain Lou Albano plays an old associate of Lester's who is hired to be 227's handyman, but harbors a big secret (not to mention several rubber bands in his beard) in ""We the People."" In ""Fifty Big Ones,"" Beah Richards (Roots: The Next Generations) and Whitman Mayo (Sanford & Son) play Mary's parents who come to town to celebrate their 50th by renewing their marriage vows.provided they even want to stay married.

One interesting fact is the episodes are presented here in production order, not broadcast order. Ordinarily, this wouldn't really be a problem for a sitcom. Here, however, it is a small flaw. The pilot episode was actually aired six episodes into the series. Since it was produced first, it is presented as the first episode on disc one. The pilot features a cliffhanger ending that is continued in ""The Sidewalk Sale."" ""Sidewalk"" was not filmed until later on in the season, so it appears as the first episode on disc two. Since the packaging does not indicate that the episodes are part one and part two of a single story, viewers will be left to figure out for themselves that the conclusion of the first episode in the set is actually found on disc tw  :)

The twenty-two episodes that make up the first season are divided onto three discs. The discs are housed in slim, clear keepcases. The front covers are yellow and each feature a separate, small cast photo. The back covers include episode numbers, episode titles, plot synopses, and basic creative credits. The double-sided coversheets show through to the inside of the case, but the interiors are simply solid yellow. The DVDs are black with ""227"" printed in a bold yellow font. The three keepcases slide into a cardboard sleeve which showcases Gibbs and Harry in front of a stoop.

The DVD menus feature static cast photos. Viewers can play all episodes or choose an individual episode. Although there are no scene selection menus, chapter stops are included.

Extras

All of the extras are found on disc three. First up is ""From Stage to Screen: 227,"" a six minute look at the play that inspired the series. Interviews with playwright Christine Houston, star Marla Gibbs, and co-creator/producer/writer Bill Boulware help to explain the process by which the show moved from stage to screen.

The six minute, thirty second ""Three Ladies Remembering 227"" gathers Alaina Reed, Jackee Harry, and Gibbs for a lively discussion of the series. The three are charming and fun to watch.

""Stories from the Stoop"" is a twenty minute featurette on the making of the series, featuring interviews with the show's stars and creative team, including Gibbs, Harry, Reed, Hal Williams, playwright Houston, directors Gerren Keith and Arlando Smith, Bill Boulware, executive producer Dick Bensfield, and co-producer Roxie Wenk-Evans. The enthusiasm of the participants is infectious, making this (and the set's other extras) a must-see for fans.",1158624000,17,5761,5.001043841336117
2111355,5,B0002O7Y8U,"227 will truly be rendered as one of the classic sitcoms of the twentieth century.  It is among the same caliber as Sanford and Son or The Jeffersons.  I think one of the underpinnings of the show's success is its dynamic cast of characters including Marla Gibbs, Helen Martin, etc.  Jackee's character, the sexy Sandra Clark, is the driving force behind this show.  227 is a family comedy that transcends all ages and races. 227's first season is a bundle of laughs.  The subsequent seasons are a must-have.  I hope they become available soon!",1153094400,4,544,4.73404255319149

Maybe sales were lackluster and they decided not release anymore seasons.  I hope that's not the case.  This show is very funny and deserves to be seen by a new generation of folks.  Hopefully with the show airing on tv land it will renew interest and the dvd sales will go up.,1152489600,3,435,4.192771084337349

I can watch this DVD season with my teenaged daughter and not be worried that there will be any inappropriate scenes.  Not so in today's TV sitcoms.  Marla Gibbs and cast had a great thing going back then.  Come back to TV Land!",1149465600,,402,4.671428571428572

2111359,5,B0002O7Y8U,"Great show. I think we can all acknowledge that 227 may have started out as Marla Gibbs show, but it quickly became a showcase for the comedic stylings of the modern day humor genius we know as Jackee. Jackee started as a bit player on the show, but audiences were so delighted and impressed that a man could play a woman's role so convincingly, that she was catapulted into superstardom. Way before Tyler Perry, Jackee donned a dress and stirred a nation into unadulterated delirium with her beautifully coiffed, but oozing of testosterone portrayal of Sandra Clark. While Jackee appeared on talk shows and at awards shows in drag, he was very good at not revealing his actual name and where he lived. So what's become of him? I'm not sure. But I want to thank him for making a shy, clumsy boy's daydreams of wearing his mother's clothes to be not as much of an abomination as he thought.",1142553600,2,889,4.5625

2111362,5,B0002O7Y8U,"I was so thrilled when this DVD hit shelves! I never expected it, yet this has always (and probably always will be) my favorite sitcom of all time. I grew up with it, and it was always the one that I could relate to the most.

227 has its occasional flaws (inconsistent writing). And this was especially true in the first season. But what makes it work to this day - and what keeps me coming back for more -- is the sense of realness in the characters. Even when the situations are totally unrealistic or the writing leaves something to be desired, the actors give you the feeling that they really could be your neighbors! They each have such distinctive personalities, that you can't help but be entertained and be left with a ""feel-good"" feeling. They brought a lot of experience to the table (especially Helen Martin and Marla Gibbs), and even more importantly, they had a real chemistry!

While some may dismiss the show as not exciting enough, one of the things that I always find comforting about this show is that it never gets overly ambitious to the point of feeling forced. Still, there is always something unique, funny, or fishy stirring -- but the focus on the home and/or family atmosphere is somehow always maintained.

I truly do hope that we will get more seasons of this gem on DVD (though I am a bit dubious). The second season improved upon the first, and the show really hit its peak in the third!",1141689600,,1418,4.509727626459144

Meanwhile, I hope the second season sees the light of day on dvd because I would love to own the episode when Sondra meets a politian who also has eyes for Brenda's teacher, played by Jayne Kennedy! The whole second season is filled with great episodes and I hope we fans won't have to wait in vain for the next release of this very funny show!!!",1133827200,33,655,4.32520325203252

2111365,5,B0002O7Y8U,"227 was at first,a broadway play that Marla Gibbs appeared in during one hiatus while still on the CBS long-running sitcom The Jeffersons. After The Jeffersons got the Nielsen axe in July 1985,ten and a half years after it premiered,Gibbs was not out of a job,since 227 became a sitcom which she starred in as well,premiering two months later(after the Jeffersons' cancellation). 227 had fellow residents at NBC at the time of premiere,those being The Cosby Show,Cheers and Family Ties,which were all long-running Emmy-winning sitcoms as well. Yes,Gibbs sure was movin' on up,but 227 got the Nielsen axe in 1990. During the run,some of her Jeffersons co-stars guest-starred in a few episodes,one being Franklin Cover who was Tom Willis(on the Jeffersons). On 227,Gibbs is Mary Jenkins,a single mother with a teenage daughter. With a starring role,Gibbs ""finally got her piece of the pie""!",1121644800,2,888,5.216783216783217
2111366,5,B0002O7Y8U,"227 was an awesome sitcom. I used to watch it every Saturday night. The series revolved around former ""Jeffersons"" star Marla Gibbs and her family and busybody neighbors. Among the best character in the series has to be Sandra Clark (played by Jack&eacute;e Harry). Sandra was always my favorite because she was so funny and over the top.

It rivaled ""The Cosby Show"" in terms of the family element and themes.  I thought that Jackee Harry's character of sassy Sandra was so funny, always coming to Mary Jenkins' apartment in her flashy, colorful dresses. Every week she was wearing something different. I was impressed by how Marla Gibbs would go from one successful show of ""The Jeffersons"" to another successful show in ""227"" all within a 15-year span!  I still can't get over how NBC scheduled the show in its final season of 1990, putting it on Sunday against very high rated shows like ""Murder She Wrote.""  But for the first four seasons from 1985 to 1989, they produced their best output. Regina King's start on this show set the tone for her roles in movies such as Jerry McGuire, Daddy Day Care, Boyz N The Hood, Ray and many others.

In watching the first episode, I had forgotten just how funny and satirical this show could be.  Marla Gibbs and Jackee Harry really made this show, and it helped to make their careers.  My only complaint with the DVDs is that the pilot episode's second half is missing.  What's up with that?  I think it should have been in order, therefore, it loses a star.  Otherwise, this is a great show...and an adequate forerunner to shows such as THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR, THE HUGHLEYS, and THE PARKERS.",1096588800,,664,4.576271186440678
2111373,2,B0002O7Y8U,"Glad I don't own a HDTV set, the compression artifacting would drive me nuts.

Columbia/Tri-Star TV show releases are typically appalling in terms of video quality.  With the advent of ""Married With Children"", at 9 episodes per disc, numerous complaints were made by others regarding video quality.

But 227's mammoth 10 episodes per disc?

No sale from me, sorry.  There's no way they can fit that many onto a disc, at that price, without sacrificing a lot.  DVD was peddled to the public with a promise of higher quality.  Columbia/Tri-star releases are next of kin to VHS in terms of video quality.  So I shall live without.

I will say this:  Columbia is taking a step in the RIGHT direction by including extras.

But video quality counts too, even if it is ""just a sitcom"".  As DVDs can last 25+ years, I find it dumb to buy it now and then wait for DVD's successor (blu-ray) where they'll sell the same titles again, using the cheapest methods possible.  Don't we customers deserve better?  If I delivered poor quality work, I'd be sacked.  And it's my time to give Columbia the pink slip.  Toodles.",1096502400,5,1105,4.647668393782383
