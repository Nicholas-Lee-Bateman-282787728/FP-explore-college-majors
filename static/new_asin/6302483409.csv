7826334,3,6302483409,"Amusing European existential film, my husband was bored after the first few minutes. Old theme--marriage of convenience, misfortune plagues protagonists, jealousy, govt bureaucrats (& French ones, at that), money woes--and people finally make it to the big-time together, fall in love, consummate their marriage & then fly off into the sunset together.  On the plus, good-looking & talented protagonists & supporting actors; on the minus side, over-long & over-the-top. For the American market, this film should have been trimmed down quite a bit!",1030838400,2,547,5.590361445783133
