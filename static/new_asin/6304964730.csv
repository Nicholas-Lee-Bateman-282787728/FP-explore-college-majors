7880614,5,6304964730,"The Atlanta Braves were going for back-to-back World Championships in the 1996 World Series and when they returned to Atlana up 2-0 on the New York Yankees, their victory seemed inevitable. After all, the Braves had outscored their opponents 48-2 over their previous five games including 12-1 and 4-0 victories over the Yankees in the Bronx behind the pitching of John Smoltz and Greg Maddux.  Then there were the heroics of rookie Andruw Jones, who became the second player in World Series history to hit home runs in his first two times at bats (Gene Tenace did it in the 1972 Fall Classic).
But then David Cone out pitched Tom Glavine 5-2 in Game 3 in Atlanta. Cone was one of several emotional stories that typified the Yankees, having returned from surgery for an aneurysm in his shoulder earlier in the season. The pivotal moment of the Series proved to come in Game 4, when with a 6-3 lead Braves Manager Bobby Cox brought in his ace reliever, Mark Wohlers in the 8th inning for the first time all season. But Yankee catcher Jim Leyritz tied the game with a 3-run blast in a fierce at bat after which the Yankees knew they could not lose and when the Yankees won 1-0 in Game 5 on an unearned run, New York went back to the Big Apple needing one more win to clinch. In Game 6 the Yankees won 3-2 on the basis of Joe Girardi's triple and the pitching of middle reliever Mariano River and Series MVP closer John Wetteland, who made the Yankees unbeatable after six innings.
The nice thing about this tape is that not only does it chronicles what happened on the field, in the League Championship and Division Series as well as the World Series, but that it also captures all of the individual stories that made the 1996 Yankees special: Manager Joe Torre's brother Frank finally getting his heart transplant, Doc Gooden coming back from his purgatory to pitch a no-hitter during the regular season, past and present teammate Darryl Strawberry finding his own redemption with his bat, Rookie of the Year Derek Jeter, Wade Boggs finally getting his World Series ring, which can also be said for Torre.
In addition to the showing all the key moments, there are also exclusvie interviews with the players providing additional insights. Coming back to sweep the Braves after losing the first two games at home made the 1996 Yankees something special. But who could have imagined that we were witnessing the rebirth of the Yankee dynasty?  None of three championships the Yankees won in the next four years were as dramatic as the 1996 series (although the loss to Arizona in 2001 was actually more exciting).  Each fall I rewatch my collection of World Series videoes and this one still remains the most special one of the bunch, probably because this was the start of the new Yankee dynasty that is still going strong today.",1083456000,6,2824,4.655310621242485
7880615,5,6304964730,"This video was great because it was made during a time when the divisional series and league championship series' got a long look, so you saw that other teams other than the Yankees and Braves were in the postseason, and what they actually did.
Three parts of the video are strongest for me. One is Joe Buck call of Jim Leyritz's HR in Game 4, ""Back at the track - at the wall - we are TIED!"" Then there's McCarver's one word description when Paul O'Neill, bad hamstring and all, reaches as far as he can to save the 1-0 shutout - ""Ballgame!""
Then there's that silly Braves fan with long, straggly black hair boasting, ""They ain't gonna beat Smoltz.""
I often wonder if she's SEEN this video...",1066348800,2,693,4.421875
7880616,5,6304964730,"The 1996 World Series video has more interviews with the players, more behind the scenes stuff (you have to love the bits with David Cone's father and Greg Maddux's father in the stands), and more cinematographic poignance than a lot of the other World Series videos out there. The fact that it was also an incredibly dramatic series helps, too! But of all the Yankee WS videos, this one is the best. If you only have one, get this one. I've watched it again and again--in fact, I may wear out the tape and need another one, soon.",1013040000,2,530,4.418367346938775
7880617,5,6304964730,"I get chills EVERY time I watch this video. It really takes you back to 96 and you feel all of the emotion of that season. The ups the downs, the Torres, everything. How could you not like this team even if you are an  avid Yankee hater. This is just a feel good team. I am getting chills  thinking about it.",956620800,3,308,3.9516129032258065
7880618,5,6304964730,"The 1996 World Series played out like a movie. This video shows the pure drama of all 6 games played. From Andy Pettit's 1-0 gem, to John Wetland's clincher in the Bronx. This is the best sports video I have seen. A true  story book finish. Go Yanks!",949968000,,250,4.208333333333333
