I loved the movie and we know most cities and places are made up the disclaimer in movies is nothing and no one is p portrayed in this movie and any resemblance is purely coincidental,  the reason the movie didn't go out all over the world because the govt felt they were to close to reality and ppl being sheep would believe it.  Yet none of them think they can fly (superman). I would love to see this movie come out to purchase. I want a copy.  Usually once a movie is made if it doesn't hit the box office, it's for sale immediately.  I want my chance of a copy. I watched my nephews copy but he moved, so i need my own.",1429488000,,713,3.958041958041958
8589554,2,B00D4FZI4Q,"This `film' is supposed to be about government corruption which we all know exists, so how is it done here? Well it is about a made up African country called Mombaire, its president is Rohamba who has a son called Stan (Winfred Pollard, this is his only credit on IMDB and probably his last) he goes to America to be an exchange student and gets to be an intern for Senator John Mordire (Mike Madsen). This is the guy who has broken a trade agreement with Mombaire, whereby the US gets its chromium cheap and in return America provides massive aid to this third world country. Mombaire also produces 94% of the world's chromium!

Right chromium is widely dispersed across the globe including Africa, Kazakhstan, India, Russia and Turkey, but occurs elsewhere. If a poor country could control the world's supply then it could charge what ever it liked and not expect hand outs from America, so not only a lie but also stupid in the first instance, so my hackles were already up at this point. Then Mr Mordire seems to go slightly mad by encouraging a load of politicians to invade Mombaire and funding an insurrection in that country to the tune of millions. Meanwhile Stan has hacked Mordires computer and can prove that he is corrupt, but decides to become a blogger to oust the man. Said blog goes instantly viral as we all know how into politics `the kids' are these days. This could be semi ok but the acting is woeful, the sound levels vary throughout, and we even have lip synch issues at one point.

The Six Million Dollar Man - Lee Majors - also makes an appearance as some corrupt news paper man and he is clearly sponsored by `Just For Men' if his Barnet is anything to go by and Mr Madsen has been helping himself to the bottle too; I also think he don't cost that much anymore. They deliver toe curlingly bad lines in a way that oozes lack of interest, almost going through the motions. The only good performance is from Francesco Quinn (Platoon) who plays Ron Garcia but he has so little on screen time that it could never pull this one back. The sound track is grating in places too and the plot holes and contrivances together with the appalling acting, lines and scenarios just make for a lamentable experience.

Not originally available on Region 1 or available on Az. Com (phew some might say)and with conflicting titles on IMDB like `Corrution. Gov' or `Conflict of Interest' this is a film that still does not know who it is or what it is really trying to do. Now you can get it from Germany of all places but I would take a rain check if I were you. If you like things that are so bad they are good, this will still disappoint as it is so bad it is dreadful.",1373068800,,2679,4.419028340080971
