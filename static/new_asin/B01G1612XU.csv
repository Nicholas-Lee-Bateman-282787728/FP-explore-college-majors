8761896,5,B01G1612XU,"This is still one of my favorite movies, it is good to have a clear copy, I wore out the video showing to kids over the years. The theme of the elephant in buddhism is wonderful. The helping of the villagers and the comrades and there relationship is really good. The themes in the war are managable, informative and educational.",1485043200,,329,4.5

8761898,5,B01G1612XU,"I first saw this movie years ago when it was on VHS, so when I saw the DVD edition a few years ago, I bought it without hesitation. Unfortunately, the quality of the transfer was horrible; it didn't look any better than the VHS version. While I haven't seen the Blu-ray edition yet, I'm really hoping the transfer quality is better. As for the movie, Glover, Liotta, and others give us a great film that shows a lighter side of the Vietnam War in their-hilarious and serious, at times-quest to deliver an elephant to a Vietnamese village.

Update: The blu-ray edition was beautiful in quality, and while the price of this particular edition was rather high, if you want the visually-best edition of the film, it's got to be blu-ray.",1466208000,3,732,4.630769230769231
