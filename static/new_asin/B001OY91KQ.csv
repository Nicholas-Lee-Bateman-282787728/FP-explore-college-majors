8331727,5,B001OY91KQ,"Have you ever wondered why this volume of Zorro (out of 10 volumes) is very scarce?  As I write this review, there are none available. All the other volumes are available.  The only way to purchase it is to buy the complete second season.  The only logical explanation that I can think of is that Annette Funicello guest stars on three shows in this volume.  Walt Disney knew she really liked Guy Williams so he put her in these three shows.  Everyone loved Annette!!",1394582400,,467,4.511904761904762
8331728,5,B001OY91KQ,One of the most influential performers of all time. Total macho and ruggedly handsome and a role model for little boys Guy is a legend in his own time. Anything with Guy Williams even Lost in Space is a joy to watch. Not to many actors like that any more. God Bless Guy in the Sky.,1280620800,,281,4.035714285714286
