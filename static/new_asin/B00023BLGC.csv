2057243,5,B00023BLGC,If you have a child who loves toy trains then you will be a hero for ordering this. My son has watched this at least 30 times and counting...,1355788800,,141,3.896551724137931
2057244,5,B00023BLGC,"I thought my son would wear out the discs. Once he ""grew up"" too much to admit loving these dvd's I donated them to our local library so other train lovers could continue to love them. I envision my son as a man eventually tracking the series down to repurchase them in whatever format is used at that time.",1313020800,,307,4.220338983050848

2057247,3,B00023BLGC,"If you already own any of ""I Love Toy Trains"" Volumes 1-12, you probably don't need this unless you're a completist.  It's like those TV shows that periodically have an episode strung together with scenes from older shows - this volume has a lot of recycled footage built around some new footage.  For the price you're probably better off buying one of the other ""I Love Toy Trains"" DVD sets first.",1103760000,16,398,4.591549295774648
