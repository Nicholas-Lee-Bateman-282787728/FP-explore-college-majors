4209688,2,B003VOVW4A,"There are bad movies, and there are 'bad, but watchable' movies...  The majority of movies in this collection are bad.  REALLY bad.  Atrocious acting, bad audio, godawful direction and weak stories simply make them unbearable. I love schlocky movies, especially old cheesy sci-fi and classic horror.  There's a line though. Cross the line, and you simply can't enjoy them.  There's nothing to enjoy!

Some of the movies in this collection appear to have been produced on nothing more than a Budget of $20 and a dare. Give me Ed Wood over this crap ANY day.

There are only two 'bad, but watchable' movies in this entire set:  ""The Hearse"" and ""Bloodlust"".

And the title is misleading.  These aren't cult hits, which it implies.  These are unknown residue, movies scraped off the back floor.  (Vienna sausages have a higher ranking in the sausage world!)",1315094400,,854,4.895104895104895
4209689,2,B003VOVW4A,"The best of the worst. Sub ""B"" movies. Entertaining none the less. Don't be taken in. The only thing they changed was the box and the title. If you have any 1950's horror movies you have these already. Same old tricks by the same old people. Man I am really getting tired of this poor business practice. Somebody in the industry needs to regulate this nonsense.",1309651200,,361,4.484848484848484
4209690,1,B003VOVW4A,"I am a huge fan and collector of ""cult cinema"" and, based on the reviews here, thought I'd give this set a shot (the price was nice also). What a major disappointment! I didn't even have to watch some of these movies to know that I wouldn't enjoy this (and most I didn't watch, including any on the second disc). After reading the back cover, had I seen this in a store, I definitely would have passed it up. The problem is that a third of these movies were made in the '60s, and one was from 1959. With the exception of Beatles and James Bond films, I hate movies from the '60s. My favorite cult flicks are all from the '70s and '80s. Plus, nearly half of these are in black & white (another thing I can't stand, besides the great Three Stooges shorts)! Lastly, a third of these are also rated PG (the only good PGs I ever saw were ""Butterfles Are Free"", ""Tootsie"", ""Noises Off"" and ""The Invisible Kid"" (which criminally remains unreleased on DVD to this day)! The only film on the first disc that I watched was ""Fleshburn"", and I ended up fast-forwarding through most of it (but, interestingly enough, saw in the closing credits that the music was by former Eagles member Don Felder). I mainly bought this to see the film, ""Lurkers"" on DVD. I have it on VHS, but the DVD version, presented in widescreen, significantly chops off a portion of the best scene! Usually, I'm not a fan of the widescreen format, but, I must say, that on the DVD of ""Tootsie"" the widescreen is a major improvement. Despite the reviews, I did not like ""The Babysitter"" (and not just because it's in b & w, either). Now, ""The Teacher"" is the type of cult cinema that I would normally go for, but I already saw it on VHS many years ago and didn't think much of it then and my opinion has not changed. Yes, Angel Tompkins is beautiful, but I feel that her best pic was ""How to Seduce a Woman"", which, inexplicably, is still not on DVD. If you liked ""The Teacher"" then be sure to pick up a copy of ""HTSW"" on VHS. In closing, I wish that someone had published a review like mine before I made my purchase. Granted, I didn't pay that much, but I still could've saved a few bucks. It's easy to understand why people who bought this are parting with their copy here on Amazon and elsewhere, which I'm glad to say I did.",1308614400,,2289,4.288683602771362
4209691,4,B003VOVW4A,"Until I saw THE BABYSITTER, I was never sure if exploitation films, whatever they may be, were worth the time. But this little slice of depravity has made me a believer--a 1969 relic that might belong to some pre-code era all its own, just before both ""softcore"" and American indie cinema cleaned things up a bit for mass consumption.  THE BABYSITTER has provocative and offensive (under-age) nudie scenes of the most heralded sort.  It has considerable violence, one sequence of which occurs an hour into the film and rivals the verite shock of the murder scenes in LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (which came out 5 years later).  There are a number of young women who cannot seem to keep their shirts on, whether by the pool or in the sauna, in the woods or in the car, all of whom are unvarnished and attractive.  Irrelevant subplots and implausible plot twists involving lesbians and bikers abound, but meanwhile, the principals Patricia Wymer (as The Babysitter) and George E. Russell (as the middle-aged seductee) are what the movie is all about, and they deliver much joy.  I have watched it twice and I'm still not sure how they got away with what they showed in this movie.  See it immediately and then join the Patricia Wymer fan club!",1300060800,26,1236,4.6728110599078345
4209692,5,B003VOVW4A,"12 movies from the 70s and 80s that back in the day were staples of in drive in, late night/afternoon cable TV, and cheap VHS rental circuit man those were the days.",1296518400,4,165,4.1875
4209693,3,B003VOVW4A,"THE BABYSITTER: If this is what babysitters were like in the 60's then my Dad was one lucky son-ofa-gun. Nowadays you're likely to get a 14 year-old asthmatic, vegetarian, environmentalist with braces. Anyhoo, this is one groovy movie from the 60's. The D.A. of Smalltownsvilleburg lives a pretty sucky life, what with his beeyotchy wife, newborn son and ""precocious"" lesbian teen daughter. Poor dude really needs a break! He gets one in the pleasing form of free-spirited, hippie babysitter Candy. One thing leads to another and the old D.A. and the young babysitter end up having an  affair. It could have ended up all unicorns and rainbows except for one thing. The D.A. is prosecuting a biker for murder, and when the biker's  gal pal finds out about the D.A.'s little DAliance, she decides to blackmail the D.A. into letting her boyfriend out of jail! Directed by Billy Jack!

BLOODLUST!: A poor man's Most Dangerous Game knock-off starring Mr. Brady himself, Robert Reed! It's pretty inept  although if you like the idea of seeing Mr. Brady stalked by a gun toting lunatic then this might be for you.

CARNIVAL OF CRIME: An old fuddy duddy architect comes home to find his hussy of a wife missing. Turns out she was murdered and the police consider him the #1 suspect. While trying to prove his innocence he learns that she has cheated on him many, many, many times. (That should speed up the grieving process!) If this wasn't shot in a cool looking 60's Brazil it wouldn't be worth watching.

THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER: I have a soft spot for giant monster movies with stop motion animation. As such I'll generously describe this one as ""Abbott and Costello meet the Loch Ness Monster"". Remember I'm being generous.

THE CREEPING TERROR: A very serious contender for ""Worst Movie Ever Made"". Basically a monster crashes into a small town in California and starts to eat everyone. It looks like a cross between a snail and a badly upholstered beanbag. It is seriously screwed up on all levels and so thoroughly bad you have to see it to believe it.

ESCAPE FROM HELL ISLAND: Mark Stevens lives the simple, happy life of a Florida charter boat captain who smuggles Cuban refugees into the country for extra cash. He meets the lovely Linda and life couldn't be better for Captain Mark, until that is, Linda's psychotically jealous husband shows up. Whuh-Oh!

FLESHBURN: There have been quite a few movies about how humans quickly abandon the veneer of civilization when forced to survive under ""primal"" conditions. This one also includes Viet Nam flashbacks, revenge, digs at modern psychiatry, Navajo mysticism, revenge, born again Christianity, revenge and Sonny Landham, the guy who played the Indian tracker in Predator. I know I shouldn't like this movie but I do anyway.

THE HEARSE: Trish Van Devere inherits a creepy old house from her aunt, who used to practice a little black magic. Before long supernatural shenanigans seem to start taking place. But are Dark Powers really at work, or is Trish having another nervous breakdown?

HORROR HIGH: A little nerd invents a potion that turns him into a blood thirsty, cheaply rendered 70's man-monster. Then he gets revenge on all those bullies. It's sort of the dark side of Teen Wolf. This is another movie I probably shouldn't like but do anyways.

LAND OF THE MINOTAUR: It's Peter Cushing as a devil-worshipping Carpathian vs. Donald Pleasance as a Catholic priest in a ...kind of dull movie.

LURKERS: I can't even explain this one. It was made in 1988 but has a ton of bad, indulgent 60's & 70's psychobabble.

THE TEACHER: Sexy Angel Tompkins plays a seductive teacher who has an affair with the kid who played Dennis the Menace. Then they both get stalked by a crazed Viet Nam vet. So looks like you've got both your Sex and Violence bases covered.",1287014400,163,3812,4.808868501529052
4209694,4,B003VOVW4A,"This is a great set Horror High, the Crater Lake Monster, Creeping Terror, Land of the Minotaur are all a lot of fun and the whole set is less than the price of any one of these campy classics individually. The prints are all complete and of a good watchable quality, I'm glad I added this to my collection even though I already had several of the movies on other sets, for me Horror High and the Crater Lake Monster alone are worth the price of admission here, and the rest is sweet retro gravy on my cheesy entre.",1283558400,51,515,4.212121212121212

4209733,5,B003VOVW4A,"I bought this DVD so I could watch ""The Hearse"". It happened to come with 11 other scary movies. Not for kids. Some of the movies have nudity. Jay ""Dennis the Menace"" North stars in one as a teen who has an affair with his teacher. ""The Babysitter"" is from the early 1960's, b&w, and must have been an old stag movie. Robert Reed (the dad on 'The Brady Bunch') stars in one of them when he was quite young and not a bad actor.

If you were lucky, you were necking instead of watching the movie. These are the kind of films that promised to thrill you with extreme violence, horror and/or nudity, and almost never delivered. Nowadays, this crap goes directly to dvd, or is made for cable, like the stuff on the sci-fi channel. I think this collection serves best as a time capsule of a bygone era for those who were trying to ""get lucky,"" too loaded to remember, in prison, or for the very inquisitive young film lover. As is usual for a Mill Creak release, it's a very mixed bag. Some are OK and some don't really belong in the set. None are what you'd call good. Worth whatever you're sucker enough to pay and not a penny more. ""The Teacher"" does deserve 4 stars for the nudity of a really hot nobody.",1315612800,,893,4.3532934131736525
