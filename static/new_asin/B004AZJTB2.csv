8421261,5,B004AZJTB2,"I think simple to learn says a lot.
By this I mean that this is the DVD that you will use.
The Five Flow Qigong is direct, straight forward, super-gentle and easy to use.
The super-gentle is important to me, as I am just pasted 70 years young, and I did not find any exercise that I did not feel comfortable practicing.
I found myself wishing that Robert had a dvd on Tai Chi. (hint-hint).",1419897600,,389,4.2
8421262,1,B004AZJTB2,This  looks like an amateur backyard film shot with family members.  i  thought the best psrt was the cat in the background.  A total waste of money.,1368489600,,149,4.407407407407407
8421263,5,B004AZJTB2,"The calming affects of a session with Robert Bates
embrace you for hours.

His gentle humor, facility with Qigong, and Medical Qigong background envelope the viewer in total bliss. Robert is dedicated to guiding others to maintain peace and holistic balance.

Expertly filmed in a serene setting, he and his  team have masterfully produced a video that motivates, supports and encourages anyone whether new to Qigong or experienced.

My highest recommendation and appreciation for this healing companion.  Buy two! You'll want to share it and use it for years!",1312502400,,560,5.247191011235955
8421264,5,B004AZJTB2,"I just discovered qigong 8 months ago, but each version I explored was too long, too complex or seemingly aimed at martial arts. I am 74 and wanted an exercise program that fit my place in life but worked effectively. Robert Bates' DVD was the ticket, and I bought the DVD at Amazon after reading the reviews. Whether you struggle with an autoimmune disease such as fibromyalgia or simply want a program that works without slamming your body around, this one will do it for you. It is calming, both emotionally and physically, and you find yourself able to handle things a bit easier during each day once you've begun to exercise regularly. Robert Bates is very thorough in his explanations and demonstrations, and you have 3 options for exercise: the long program, the 24 minute program (my favorite), and the 12 minute program. Once you have settled into this DVD on a regular basis, I believe you will be very happy you chose it.",1309996800,4,932,4.654545454545454
8421265,5,B004AZJTB2,"I can't imagine a better tool for the home practice of Qigong. It's divided into three parts, each immediately accessible: a guided instruction in each of the forms, a 24-minute silent practice, and a 12-minute silent practice session. You have the flexibility to go back to the initial instruction any time to refine your practice, to complete the full 24-minute practice when time allows, or the 12-minute practice when time doesn't.  The sessions take place in the peace and beauty of his exquisite garden. Although there is no conversation in the practice sessions, the microphone is on to catch the sounds of a lovely summer day--e.g., the slight rustling in the breeze of the Japanese maple that is part of the backdrop.  It's so comfortable and relaxed--just you and Robert in that beautiful setting--I think you'll find as I did that you'll look forward to practice rather than think of it as another thing you're ""supposed to do.""",1290124800,4,939,4.936708860759493
8421266,5,B004AZJTB2,"This DVD is a clear, accessible, inspiring introduction to an easy-to-learn qigong practice. The first section has very detailed explanations of how and why each movement is done and the next two sections are an opportunity to do the practice with Robert and without the mental distraction of language. The practice is simple and more powerful than you would guess until you try it for a period of time.",1289520000,2,403,4.855072463768116
8421267,5,B004AZJTB2,"Robert Bates is a wonderful teacher, and transmits a deep understanding not only as one who practices and teaches QiGong, but from his healing work and his knowledge of how we all can develop health and well-being. I highly recommend this easy to learn set of lessons on QiGong.

8421268,5,B004AZJTB2,I have studied several Qi Gong systems over the past 10 years and find this DVD to be strait forward and detailed.  It is great at any level of training and is especially accessible to the beginner.  I highly recommend this DVD if you want a powerful Qi workout that does not require a lot of time to practice.,1289347200,4,310,4.237288135593221
