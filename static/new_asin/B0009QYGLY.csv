8065517,1,B0009QYGLY,"Is this a joke? I can't believe I wasted $30 on this. It looks ancient, and there's weird organ music in the background that distracts so badly you can't even pay attention.",1454284800,,173,4.4375
8065518,3,B0009QYGLY,"This is a very low-budget dvd with computer .midi sound files, though decent editing. Jerry actually does have presence & probably a good teacher you wouldn't fall asleep on, but you could tell he was stiff/shy about the camera, constantly looking/reading word for word off cue cards & even enunciating every word slowly in some parts.

I only skimmed over this dvd in some parts. Each of the organ meridians only contained info on where they are on the body. Indications for the points were rarely given. There is a small section on how chi moves (from what organ to what organ), alarm points, very basic info about Kyo & jitsu, command points, 5 elements, vverry basic almost nothing on abdominal diagnosis, palpation & diagnosis & an example of a treatment on kyphosis.",1175731200,4,772,4.804511278195489
8065519,1,B0009QYGLY,THIS SO CALLED ADVANCE SHIATSU IS NOT ADVANCE AT ALL. THAT'S BECAUSE IT SHOWED MERIDIAN AND TSUBO POINT DOES NOT MAKE IT ADVANCE. SHIATSU IS NOT ONLY USE FINGER AND PALM PRESS BUT USUES LOT OF DIFFERENT STRECHING TECHNICS. WE ARE NOT PRACTICING IN JAPAN WHICH THEIR GOVERMENT MADE THE RULES WHICH TECHNIC TO USE. TECHNICS FROM AMMA(JAPANNESS MASSAGE) IS NOT ALLOWED TO AVOID CONFLICT FROM AMMA PRACTIONER MOSTLY COMPOSED OF BLINDS. AT LAST THE SHIATSU AMMA TECHNICS IS MORE LIKE ADVENCE TO ME.,1158537600,3,493,4.880952380952381
8065520,5,B0009QYGLY,"This DVD would be useful for someone actually going through training for Shiatsu Massage.  It details all the energy meridians and principles of diagnosis and treatment.  It shows many points along each meridian and how to work them and even descibes the uses of many.  The many camera angles allow you to see everything clearly.  For people who don't want such detailed training, Mr. Luglio has a ""Shiatsu Made Simple"" DVD in which you can do the massage as you follow along with the DVD.  The ""Advanced"" program is more like going to an actual Shiatsu training school.",1147824000,5,570,4.775510204081633
