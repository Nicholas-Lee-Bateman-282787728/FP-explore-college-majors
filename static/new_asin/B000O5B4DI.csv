2790291,5,B000O5B4DI,"I bought this movie because of a reference to Big Country doing the music for it.  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  It's not quite what I would call ""laugh out loud"" funny but there are quite a few great moments.  Once I started watching I couldn't wait to see what came next.  Excellent acting, great music, unique and entertaining plot (although the ending was fairly predictable).  All in all, well worth the money.",1200614400,9,453,4.6835443037974684
2790292,4,B000O5B4DI,I saw this film when it first came out and was delighted to see it available on DVD. It's a sweet film suitable for the whole family (although some might have a tricky time following the Scottish accents) with some very funny moments. There are one or two holes in the plot but overall it's a charming film. And you definitely don't want to miss that gorgeous Scottish countryside.,1194739200,9,381,4.536231884057971
2790313,4,B000O5B4DI,"This movie has a great soundtrack. Big Country did a great job scoring the film. I liked the characters, story, and production. It was fun and engaging. It wasn't vulgar which means you can watch it with nearly anyone in the room. There is some language, but it's not too aggressive.",1457049600,,283,4.568627450980392
2790314,5,B000O5B4DI,this was a surprisingly entertaining movie,1454371200,,42,6.166666666666667
2790315,4,B000O5B4DI,Amiable and mildly humourous with an interesting premise..  The film maker also obviously loved Scotland and showed frequent shots of beaufiful landscapes. Well acted.,1453507200,,167,5.958333333333333
2790316,3,B000O5B4DI,"Entertaining and engaging if a bit predictable and too quick to trot out the tropes.  The ground it covers has been covered before, but harmless and cute enough to be worth the time.",1451952000,,182,4.515151515151516
2790317,3,B000O5B4DI,"Scotland has an increasingly accurate opinion of the US. What amazes me are the 5 star reviews. So these people are saying that Restless is on par with Gladiator, Braveheart, and other actual 5 start movies. Using that analogy it's not even a three star, but it was an average movie with ok acting from upstarts.",1448236800,,312,4.589285714285714
2790318,5,B000O5B4DI,"After reading a very good review of ""Restless Natives"" in the Los Angeles Times back in 1980-something, I caught the movie in a small cinema in L.A. (I already had Big Country's terrific 4-song EP of music for the film although I had not heard of it at the time) and became a big fan. For the rest of the 20th century, there was no U.S. home video release and ""Natives"" was so obscure, that it wasn't even listed in Leonard Maltin's thick movie guide.

The story? Two young men, Will (unemployed) & Ronnie (stuck behind the counter at a joke shop selling plastic poo & ""nasty sugar"" to preteen boys) set out to improve their lot with a series of tour bus robberies using a toy gun from Ronnie's shop that shoots a mixture of pepper and sneezing powder. Dressed as a clown & a wolfman, their colorful approach makes them local sensations in their small Scottish town. Soon the tourists are hoping to see the pair and become willing victims.

But what is this? A coming-of-age movie? A ""buddy flick?"" Maybe a quirky romantic comedy/adventure? I see Amazon has grouped it with Bill Forsyth's films from the '80's and it indeed has the charm and wit that made ""Local Hero"" such a great movie. The scenery is fine (beautiful at times), the editing keeps just the right the pace, and characters are well written and appealing. The Scottish setting itself could be a considered personality as well. Presented in widescreen and glorious monophonic sound, this is a winner, a charmer, a little classic you can share with friends who have likely never heard of it before!",1436659200,,1561,4.611510791366906
2790319,5,B000O5B4DI,This movie is a must for any Big Country fan. There are stunning visual scenes paired with the amazing soundtrack. The story line is charming and well acted by the cast.,1431648000,,169,4.483870967741935

2790321,1,B000O5B4DI,"If it were possible, I would give it zero stars. If this is what the Scots think of Americans, Americans should return the same ill will.",1425945600,,137,4.3076923076923075

2790333,5,B000O5B4DI,Great movie- we loved the scenery and the Scottish humor!,1424563200,,57,4.8
2790334,4,B000O5B4DI,i liked it but at this late date it has been done to death with many variations. it is a sweet kind of funny film about possibilities and hope in a time of economic slump. who doesn't like the robin hood story??,1403395200,2,211,4.0476190476190474
2790335,4,B000O5B4DI,"We were wanting to watch a movie which featured the people and places of Scotland. This movie offered a gentle, sweet comedy and views of Edinburgh and surrounding countryside. Watch out for 80's hair!",1402444800,,201,4.9411764705882355
2790336,4,B000O5B4DI,"My hubby is from Scotland so the accents didn't bother me.  Thought it was funny but a few things bothered me.  like them keeping the belongings of those they stole from..not the money, who cares, but the personal things like rings and watches, etc.  my opinion...
Thought Ned Beatty, a wonderful actor, was wasted in this movie.  Maybe he was just in Scotland and volunteered  his performance.  Who knows.",1402358400,,406,4.811594202898551
2790337,4,B000O5B4DI,"As the other reviewers have written, this is not a life-changing or ground-breaking film; it is simply a very pleasant way to spend an hour... and that is quite enough.",1399939200,,168,4.633333333333334
2790338,3,B000O5B4DI,"Restless Natives is a fun, whimsical tale of what happens when bored, broke friends, cast caution and ethics aside, go for a ride while wearing goofy get ups, committing hold ups, talk to dead people, find danger, romance and fame...and more stuff like that. It ain't an epic adventure. It's just a fun little film wearing only its own storyline, the actors unvarnished abilities, and the charm of the location. No CG. No explosions. No gratuitous skin, blood or profanity. Just some real fun in real time. Charming but not life changing. Worth watching when you want a smile.",1399680000,,576,4.828282828282828
2790339,2,B000O5B4DI,"I purchased a copy of this film based-upon the positively glowing reviews I read here as well as some additional commentary comparing this to the work of Bill Forsyth. While this film tries very hard to be whimsical, it really, really stretches credibility (you have to suspend your disbelief to its utmost to buy-in to the story) and lacks the cohesion, character-development, magic, and soul (not to mention inspired direction and top-notch acting) found in Forsyth's Scottish films of the early 1980s. Certainly the cinematography of the sublime Scottish countryside is wonderful and the film has its heart in the right place, but to be asked to accept that nearly everyone in Edinburgh is aware of the robbers' identity (even a band of kids) while the bumbling police can't figure it out or that a group of Japanese journalists can somehow catch-up with the on-the-run crooks while the cops cannot makes the film too slight and way too silly. If you're a fan of the band Big Country, you'll no doubt want to take a look at this since they composed the soundtrack, but otherwise, if you're looking for a long-lost gem you won't discover it here unless you're okay with a plot that requires you to ditch all sense of reality. Stick with the real thing and get a copy of Forsyth's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Local-Hero-1983/dp/B0060C4KCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Local Hero (1983)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comfort-Joy-VHS/dp/B000006J0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comfort & Joy [VHS</a>] instead.",1395964800,,1608,5.846808510638298
2790340,5,B000O5B4DI,"Enjoyed watching this again.  Much of the film was made in Lochgoilhead and cast and crew stayed at the Carrick Castle Hotel where I was working.  They needed  10 extras to play the parts of policemen and asked for  help.  My brother, 2 brothers-in-law and several local friends got the parts.  We all had fun and ate lots of donuts from the catering truck!",1394323200,2,357,4.5
2790341,4,B000O5B4DI,"This was fun to watch -- it's innocent in a way some people may not like but I loved it. The characters are likeable and real, and it has some laugh-aloud moments.

The two boys (main characters) are COMPLETELY real --you're really on their side -- and the younger children who pop in and out seemed real to me too.

The depiction of the police made me laugh. There are three mainly silent but drily humorous Scots The American is fat, rude, absurdly dressed, and always on the phone to his lawyer about his divorce -- which the Scots all find hilarious, especially as he negotiates for visiting rights to the couple's dog.

It was also fun to see Edinburgh Castle and bits of the Scottish countryside (the sign to Glencoe near the climax was a good touch).",1391904000,,757,4.471014492753623
2790342,5,B000O5B4DI,"I had always wanted to see this because Stuart Adamson and Big Country wrote the score.  The movie itself is great!  But if you are a Big Country fan, you will want this in your collection.",1390867200,,189,4.222222222222222
2790353,4,B000O5B4DI,Well worth the cost of watching.  This is an off-beat comedy that was a great way to spend a rainy Saturday.  Get past the 80's hair and you will enjoy yourself.,1388966400,,161,4.161290322580645
2790354,5,B000O5B4DI,"One of my all time favorites, it has it all... quirky Scottish humor, lovable characters, grand scenery, Big Country music score and a weird twisted plot that's fun to watch more than once. I don't buy very many movies, but this is one I just had to have.",1379462400,6,255,4.333333333333333
2790355,4,B000O5B4DI,"I saw this film years ago in the theatre, and was blown away by it charm and humour ... I've been looking for it on DVD for at least 20 years and am glad to see it having a rebirth in that medium. Hilarious romp through Scotland by two unemployed teens on the dole ... two modern day Rob Roys ... if you're looking for something completely different, pick this little foreign gem up! Caution: the Scots accents are quite thick and it may take you one or two viewing to get the hang of it, but well worth it!",1350086400,3,507,4.08

I even like the music.  Stay tuned for other reviews...I have a secret finds list over on IMDB.",1348272000,,356,4.144927536231884
2790357,5,B000O5B4DI,"I bought this for my husband who is a Big Country fanatic, and has been waiting for this product for several years.  He thoroughly enjoyed the dvd and couldn't wait to tell me of it.",1281052800,,182,4.2
2790358,4,B000O5B4DI,"A gently wry comedy for those who enjoyed great 'human condition' films like Gregory's Girl or Local Hero. The dialogue does occasionally stiffen up a bit under it's occasionally strained attempts to be funny, but there is plenty of pace and genuinely humorous moments to keep things trundling along.
  As is so often the case with good comedies, we find ourselves actually caring about the fate of the two luckless central figures, and their modern brand of Robin Hood-style of generosity is surely as poignant for todays avaricious society as it was when Thatcher's government ruled with an iron Lochgelly from faraway Westminster (and yes, the political context IS relevant!).
  Camera direction and clipping are of a decent standard, quite typical for the time and genre and never intrusive. The actors are familiar faces rather than major stars, including the Obligatory Yank, but this does not detract fromk the generally high standard of acting. The film is actually shot in Scotland (instead of the usual Ireland!), and dramatic scenery around Glencoe and other areas is employed to advantage. Add to this a soundtrack by Scottish masterband Big Country, and you have a surefire film experience that tolerates repeated viewing. Don't hesitate, press the order button...",1278374400,,1277,5.214634146341464
2790359,5,B000O5B4DI,"If told you how long I've been looking for this film...finding a VHS copy some years ago was such a coup for me - but finding the DVD - what a joy!
There are so mant hilarious & touching moments in this flick but it is SO much more than the sum of its parts.
It's funny - another reviewer mentioned Big Country (the band does the soundtrack of the film) and I, too heard the music before seeing the film.
I cannae (*grins*) find the words - it's a magical movie, it really is.
Try it, you'll love it!",1213920000,4,500,4.01
2790360,4,B000O5B4DI,"I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival back in , I don't know, 1986. I had to see it twice because of the accents (did he say ""clown"" or did he say ""clone""?). I later made a tape of it when it was shown on cable and I was elated to find it out on DVD.

The movie is still a visual two thumbs up and the soundtrack (by Big Country) still kicks [...]. But if you are looking for a laugh so hard that your sides hurt kinda movie, this isn't it. As for the plot, it works. If I'm recalling correctly, Scotland did have a high unemployment rate during the early 80's so the premise of holding up tour buses isn't too far fetched.",1206489600,,644,3.992248062015504
2790361,5,B000O5B4DI,"This takes me back: Tight jeans, the old St Andrews Bus Station, police driving light blue Mark I Ford escorts, Princes Street open to vehicles other than buses and taxis...

Ok so I'm describing the incidentals but that's what keeps me interested in this movie. Mullaney and Friell give stellar performances as two young lads looking for money and adventure. Terri Lally provides a good supporting role as the love interest and Big Country twang their guitars from Edinburgh to Inverness. Top fun!",1201305600,3,498,5.0
2790362,5,B000O5B4DI,"I can't believe this is finally available on DVD!  I have been waiting a very long time for this.

What initially drew me to this film was the fact that Big Country wrote and performed the soundtrack.  But I am so glad I watched it, as it is an absolute gem.  It is the tale of 2 friends in Scotland who decide to earn a little extra money by holding up tour buses and robbing the rich tourists of their cash and jewellery.  Disguising themselves by wearing wolfman and clown masks, they lead the police on a merry chase through some truly stunning parts of Scotland.  They even become tourist attractions themselves, with people clamouring to be on the buses that are most likely to be held up.  Highly recommended if only for the breathtaking scenery and the wonderful soundtrack.",1201046400,6,782,4.542857142857143
