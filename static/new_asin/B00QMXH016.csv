6877171,5,B00QMXH016,Wonderful series. Such complex characters and excellent acting. Highly recommended!,1467331200,,83,7.4
6877172,4,B00QMXH016,"It's almost there, just a few hairs away from really good. The cast was wisely chosen, all stellar. The lead, Krista Kosonen (Saara), is exceptionally authentic and versatile as the committed social worker in child welfare, who longs for a child of her own. Nikki Nousianen (Matti) gives a first rate performance with lots of realism and range.  Matti, both regrettably and fortuitously, swims into Saara's life, leaving an indelible mark. The storyline is meaty enough and the comedic scenes work very well; there are just a few too many stretches between the most compelling scenes. The talent in the writing is obvious; it's just a bit inconsistent and that alters the pace, slows it down.  But, in all fairness, I could not stop watching and  took no pauses between any of the 6 episodes.",1467072000,8,792,4.851851851851852
6877173,5,B00QMXH016,"Great short series on a woman deciding to have a child even though some issues emerge. But the acting is excellent. Also its not only about having a baby because the leading character (Saara, Krista Kosonen) works in a child welfare agency. Many discussions are about children but not superficial, very deep. Much is centered on adult's view of children. If you would like an adult's analysis of children, slow moving, no sex, no violence, then you would love this series. It is Finnish but it could be set anywhere.",1465171200,7,516,4.7444444444444445
6877174,5,B00QMXH016,Great show. Very direct. Beautiful characters.,1481846400,,46,6.833333333333333

6877176,5,B00QMXH016,"A mini-series that I thoroughly enjoyed! It's in Finnish, so you'll have to turn-on captions, but if you don't mind reading the subtitles, you will like this very much.",1476057600,6,168,4.827586206896552
6877177,5,B00QMXH016,"Great little series! If you don't understand Finnish, turn on the closed captioning to watch. The characters has a lot of depth to themeven the antagonists. Not sure if it's just a mini-series (it felt complete on its own), but I will keep an eye out for future episodes.",1476057600,2,271,4.551020408163265
6877178,1,B00QMXH016,"YES, I literally got a headache after 10 minutes.  A bunch of high school kids with there allowance money made this.",1474761600,,116,4.523809523809524
6877179,5,B00QMXH016,"I loved this series.  It's a commentary on life and how strange it can be, how chance can really affect our lives.  I hope there is a season 2.",1473811200,,143,3.896551724137931
6877180,5,B00QMXH016,"Don't be dissuaded by lack of subtitles as the closed captioning is in English. Once I started this series, I had to binge watch it all the way through. These characters are real and leave you wanting to know what happens next in their lives.",1473465600,2,242,4.4
6877181,1,B00QMXH016,THERE IS NO ENGLISH.!!!!!!!!!!! there is no warning that there is no english!!!! not even english subtitles. this better not happen again!!!!!,1470873600,4,142,5.5
6877182,5,B00QMXH016,"I am so impressed by this series! The concerns of these characters are all long-term. Like... LONNNNNNNG TERRRRRMMMMM! No short little snapshots of cutesy decisions here. No hot actresses tossing their hair, showing cleavage, living in cool apartments while working as baristas. In short, this is not Hollywood making a series about a single mom.

What I really appreciated was how the men are portrayed. The fathers of the children they don't want but the moms want. They have very understandable reasons for not wanting. No excuses for 'bugging out' and evading responsibility if the child is from the dad, just an explanation of how he feels. It's a refreshing and sobering change to the usual treatment of this topic on U.S. television.

This is so no a comedy. This is so not an advertisement for the benefits of being a single mom. At the same time, it is not depressing. These are people whose lives are going to continue no matter what and all the things that happen in real life are not written by scriptwriters. So, as close as this can be to realistic human concerns, that is how this series was written.

I am enjoying the heck out of this show. It can't be rushed. I think if I watch all the episodes, I may be disappointed at times but so far, every single scene has been spot on.",1468108800,10,1294,4.568965517241379
6877183,5,B00QMXH016,"Really enjoyed this drama; the acting was great and the story was just complex enough to be interesting without too many plot turns.  It seemed very natural. Set in Finland, the sets design were distinct and sharp. The series doesn't come with subtitles, so we used the closed captioning option on the remote. I will be looking for other shows from this director and cast.",1467676800,4,372,4.723076923076923
8692114,4,B00QMXH016,Amazon Prime really pays off when I find gems like this.  Unexpected twists keep the story lively.  Could have watched more episodes or seasons.  The characters and actors were engaging.,1508803200,,186,5.133333333333334

8692119,5,B00QMXH016,"Loved this! It left me wishing there were more episodes. The character development was done remarkably well for having only 6 episodes, and it came across as genuine. They were able to express true joy and sadness at real life experiences without ever coming across as saccharine. I also enjoyed that it's set in Finland and in Finnish (just turn on the English captions). It is definitely worth watching.",1492560000,2,405,4.884057971014493
8692120,5,B00QMXH016,"Wanted more episodes!  Had me intrigued if other Finnish television series consistently show that caliber of character development, even in the minor players and tertiary cast.  Often, it felt like a psychological thriller or mystery in that new elements and aspects of people's personalities kept being revealed according to differing circumstances.  I think that-- leaps and bounds better than American television-- ""Second Chance"" demonstrates how many supposedly polar opposite traits (altruistic vs. selfish, open hearted or minded vs. closed, leading vs.following) co-exist within the same person in reaction/response to context or environmental cues.  Saari seemed like a conscientious and slightly green (though competent and still learning) social worker.  The professional standards to maintain a collected demeanor and all the ready answers to interpersonal dynamics really dovetailed nicely for sartorial wit considering the contained upheaval of her personal life circumstances.

Brilliant storyline(s), casting, and production values.  Finnish interior design, graphic design, fashion, and other cultural markers stood out as cohesive and original that added to the world within world sensation.  Well done all around.",1491868800,3,1232,6.08092485549133
8692121,4,B00QMXH016,"started off in the wrong direction with the assertion ""I want a baby"" as if there weren't already excessive billions of programmable illogic devices for which the Earth is incapable of supplying food and lodging, let alone adequate education for becoming human as distinct from mindless puppets of the felony tax evading slave mongering ""religion"" gangs.  Proceeded with detailed exploitation of the felony tax evading religionist pretense of a ""Father Almighty"".  Meanwhile reality remains that each programmable illogic device born resulted from the sole and separate decision of the ""mother"" to carry a parasitic infestation to full term.  Consistent with the Wholly Roman Umpire's insistence that the torture maiming and murder of male citizens absolves themselves of the crimes they perpetrate against males.  Wound out in Episode 6 however with a positive feeling conclusion and worthy overall of a four star rating.  Well acted by Krista Kosonen and the supporting players.",1491782400,,980,5.4635761589403975
8692122,5,B00QMXH016,"I really enjoyed this series.  The main character, Saara, was a very sympathetic character, and I was interested to find out what would happen with her and the baby.  Watching a series set in Finland was also quite interesting.  Krista Kosonen is a good actress, and also quite beautiful.  I am surprised she is not more famous internationally.  Thanks to Amazon for providing this series with Prime.",1490400000,2,400,4.91044776119403
8692123,5,B00QMXH016,"This miniseries from Finland is excellent. Very well written and the actors are great. A married woman is told she can't have children. After a fight with her husband she goes off to her family's house on the lake, meets a stranger, they drink too much...and you see what happens next. As a child social worker, her cases on the job play a big part in the show too. Really well done. Ignore the one star reviews from people who claimed there wasn't subtitles. Just click on closed caption and you will get English subtitles.",1488931200,2,524,4.526315789473684
