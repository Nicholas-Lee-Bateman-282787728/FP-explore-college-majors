8088368,5,B000BKSJES,"I've known ""Gatchaman"" as ""Battle of the Planets"" in 1979 and I was 10 years old by then.  My favorite episode in this DVD is ""The Camera Iron Shutter Killer-Episode 48"".  In ""Battle of the Planets"" version is ""Raid On A Nearby Planet"".  I've seen this episode for so many times during ""Battle of the Planets"" time.  I really like the moments in this episode when Ken The Eagle put his hands around Jun The Swan's shoulders.  I also saw these episode in ""G-Force"" version and I saved it in my betamax tape.  The sad thing is ""Battle of the Planets"" and ""G-Force"" are no longer aired in the Philippines and the betamax tape is gone.  After so many years of waiting to see it again, I've search the internet.  I figure it out that my favorite cartoon was a translated version from original ""Gatchaman"".  Until I found Amazon.com, and selling Gatchaman DVDs.  When I saw the episodes included in Gatchaman Vol. 8, I found my favorite episode.  And finally I owned it now as a Gatchaman version.  And of course I used my digital camera to take the pictures of my favorite moments in Episode 48.  Thank You Amazon!!!",1169078400,,1111,4.495
