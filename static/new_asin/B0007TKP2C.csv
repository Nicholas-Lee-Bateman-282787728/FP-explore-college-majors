8051396,5,B0007TKP2C,I purchased this many years ago in VHS format and am so happy to have it on DVD!  Great set of five 12 minute workouts.  Each day gets a little more challenging.,1428105600,,161,4.0

8051398,2,B0007TKP2C,"not too much of a fan , it was very boring , I tried it a couple of times, but in all honesty, I prefer the biggest loser, workout video",1368748800,,136,3.566666666666667
8051399,5,B0007TKP2C,"I like all of Kathy Irelands workout videos. Kathy explains exactly how to do the exercise, what muscles it targets, and they are challenging but not so hard that you quit. Kathy keeps you motivated.",1287014400,,199,4.714285714285714
8051400,5,B0007TKP2C,"I absolutely love this video for core strengthening and toning. I do a half hour of tae-bo cardio and then pop in this DVD for a 12 minute tone-up and I'm good to go.  Using this routine plus a healthy diet, I have actually lost an inch off my waistline in just two months! I wasn't even overweight to begin with- just out of shape.
I really like the way the DVD is set up so you can choose which workout you want to do, and how the warm up is seperate from the workouts.  Since I do tae-bo first, I really don't need the warm up on this DVD prior to the ab workout.
I'm really glad I made this purchase!",1241913600,3,604,3.942622950819672
8051401,5,B0007TKP2C,"This DVD has been great!!! It is real fun to do and it has a way of making you feel like you have done a great job!
It gets hard as the week goes but it worths to keep doing it.
I have done it for a month now and have realized that my belly shrank quite some.
And Kathy, instructor, is a real fun to work with! Everybody on this DVD is entusiastic and great!
You will love it too!",1190332800,3,380,3.7037037037037037
8051402,5,B0007TKP2C,"This is a longtime favorite of mine - introduced me to the triple decker, which whips the lower abs into shape. Probably half of the moves are beginner and I do regular crunches instead, but the other half of the moves are wonderful, challenging and yet still fun to do. Great ab workout!",1186185600,6,288,4.452830188679245
8051403,5,B0007TKP2C,"This workout is probably the best of her tapes/DVD series.  It is just 10 minutes each day, five days a week.  It is challenging and it definitely is a workout for your midsection.  Unlike some of her other workouts that seem a bit slow and not as tiring, this one has a great tempo that tires you out.",1170374400,3,302,4.172413793103448
8051404,5,B0007TKP2C,"I'm glad this is finally available on DVD - I've just about worn out my old VHS version of it.  On this DVD you get an introduction by Kathy, followed by a warm-up routine.  This is composed of some light aerobics and stretching.  Then you get five different ab workouts, one for each day of the week.  They each last about 10 - 12 minutes (I never actually timed them, but it seems like they get progressively longer from the first to the last).  Each workout consists of approximately five different exercises, though there may be two or three variations on an exercise, so there's quite a bit of variety.  Areas targeted are upper and lower abs and obliques (the muscles along the sides of the abs).  The Monday workout is fairly easy and shouldn't present a problem for any but the most out-of-shape individuals.  Tuesday's workout is only slightly harder.  By the time you get to Wednesday and Thursday, they start getting rather challenging.  To get through these you'll need to be in fairly descent shape.  Friday is the really difficult one, I'd say a person would have to be in excellent shape to complete it.

Of course, you can just stop and take a short rest if the exercises get to hard for you, then join back in.  It took me about six weeks before I was able to complete the Friday workout all the way through without taking a few little breaks.  I like to use this video as a warm-up before my weight lifting workout.

Kathy does the workout along with 5 other people.  The music is unobtrusive synth-pop type stuff with a little funk edge to it.  You'll need a bench (or chair) and some dumbells (only used on two exercises, you could use some other object if you don't have dumbells).

I'd recommend this tape for the moderately fit individual looking to get into even better shape.  You'll definitely get a six-pack from doing these workouts, provided that your body fat percentage is low enough that you can see your abs.",1137456000,18,1941,4.54178674351585
