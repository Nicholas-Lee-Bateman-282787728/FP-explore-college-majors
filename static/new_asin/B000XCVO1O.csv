8227917,5,B000XCVO1O,"Wow. That's the only word to describe this historical rodeo piece. The old footage and pictures have been utilized to memorialize and tell a great story about our US past. If you buy this for no other reason than to look at the footage, you won't be sorry. Watching this DVD is like sitting around the camp fire swapping stories. The more you watch it, the more you see and learn.",1193875200,4,380,4.366197183098592
8227918,5,B000XCVO1O,"Step back to when it all began; legendary bronc riders, cowboys and cowgirls, and the horses they rode-in on. A walk through the Old West of Rodeo's, with film footage, for all who ever were, or still want to be, cowboys.",1193702400,3,221,4.414634146341464
8227919,5,B000XCVO1O,"This thoroughly researched and well-produced documentary is a favorite part of my video collection.  I love the turn-of-the-century footage of horse-breaking and roping on the open range.  It never ceases to amaze me that this authentic, 100+-year-old cowboy action could be captured on film -- and I can watch it any time I want.  The legendary cowboys, cowgirls and rough stock in this DVD are all gone today, but they live on in Let 'Er Buck!  The footage of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show makes you feel like you are there.  Ditto the archival film from Cheyenne, Prescott, Pendleton and other old-time rodeos.  I love seeing the likes of Yakima Kanutt, Lee Caldwell, Jackson Sundown and Ike Rude in action.  Best of all, I love the section on the cowgirls -- Mabel Strickland, Bonnie McCarroll, Lulu Belle Parr and my personal favorite, Tillie Baldwin.  Unfortunately, lovers of the American West today will never get a chance to meet these daredevils of yesteryear.  The next best thing is watching them in Let 'Er Buck!  Hats off to producer and director Lance Valdespino, and a big ""thank you"" for researching and preserving these rare moments for all of us to enjoy!",1193616000,5,1174,4.8542713567839195
