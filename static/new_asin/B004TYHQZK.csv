4466156,5,B004TYHQZK,"I do love Korean Dramas and this one is a huge production.  Huge casts and interesting landscapes.  I wish I understood Korean since the subtitles do not do credit to the dialogue that may be happening.
The set was in new condition and delivered very quickly, you did a perfect job.  thank you.",1355270400,4,294,4.509433962264151
4466157,3,B004TYHQZK,"I am half way through watching this drama and while the subtitles are good, there were a few episodes where the sound did not sync with the action. So far ep12 is the only episode I found that did not show subtitles, jolly showed ""Episode 12"" at the bottom of the screen throughout the whole episode.  For the price I paid, I was a bit disappointed.",1352160000,3,349,4.287878787878788
4466158,5,B004TYHQZK,"I got this version by Poh kim and the subtitle is very good and accurate. This is one of the best Korean dramas and it was a delight to get a copy with good English subs so that one can enjoy the story and follow the action. The story of the first kings four gods is a very intriguing, interesting and heart warming tale, that asked  a lot deep and meaningful questions of life. Please see my previous review on this for details,I just wanted to add that this version has excellent English subtitles and I recommend gladly. The musical score is another reason to see this.",1349568000,7,572,4.345794392523365
4466159,5,B004TYHQZK,This has to be the best sub titled movie I have ever watched.. This was a well made movie even If I did find a minor flaw in filming.  About 99 percent of the subtitles stay up long enough to read them and they are plenty large so you won't have to squint.,1348185600,2,256,3.830188679245283
4466160,5,B004TYHQZK,"If you are searching for well translated English subtitles for this fantastic series, this is the edition to get! I read the reviews of all the other versions out there before settling on this one from Asian Entertainment. DVD arrived quickly in perfect condition and played flawlessly. As the title of my review suggests, I was worried about how the subtitles might turn out, having once bought a painfully nonsensical edition of ""Il Mare."" You see, I love ""Il Mare""; the edition I bought mangled the poetic dialogue so badly I started learning Korean so that I would not have to filter that beautiful film thought the woeful nonsense that stood for english subtitles.

Anyway, coming back to ""' ' ' ' '"" (""Tae Wang Sa Shin Gi""): the subtitles in this edition of the series is a credit to the wonderfully told story starring the fantastic Bae Yong Jun!",1341619200,3,853,4.6866666666666665
8441080,2,B004TYHQZK,"I have purchased many good quality Korean shows on Amazon,. But, I am Very disappointed with this purchase
.Very poor quality.
. The discs skipped, jump4ed and froze all the time. Was unable to watch almost all of it.",1515715200,,217,4.589743589743589
8441081,2,B004TYHQZK,"The story itself is very entertaining, but the disks are horrible. They skip, freeze and the sound cuts out. There's no scratches on the disks so I have no idea why they do this, but it's made watching the drama very difficult. For the amount of money I paid for them I'm quite disappointed, I could probably get a better quality watching for free off youtube.",1482105600,,360,4.46969696969697

8441085,3,B004TYHQZK,The story by itself is a masterpiece and it's a real shame that what I received is a really poor quality of DVDs. This story is too beautiful to come with such disappointing quality of edition.,1421798400,,193,4.388888888888889

8441087,5,B004TYHQZK,"Wow!  I've watched many great Korean drama series, but this one 's gotta be one of the best I've seen!  The story is excellent.  It's about the story of one of the greatest warrior kings of Goguryo, Gwangaeto the Great. A mixture of epic battles, love story, realism and fantasy, I couldn't stop watching it.  The actors were fantastic, the costumes, the setting - there's was nothing to find fault with, and I'm a difficult critic to please. This was well worth the money I spent on this DVD set. A+++",1402099200,,502,4.483516483516484
8441088,5,B004TYHQZK,"This is an INCREDIBLE 29 episode Korean drama from 2008 starring Bae Yong Joon and many other talented Korean actors whom you will recognize if you watch a lot of K-dramas, as I do. But the version I got from Asian Entertainment had no subtitles and I had to return it. THIS SHOW DESERVES BETTER! It's truly a masterpiece. NOTHING like it has EVER been seen on American television. The special effects alone must have cost millions. Every episode is filmed like a movie, not a typical K-drama. Bae Yong Joon plays several roles, and does a fine job. Philip Lee is great as eye candy in one of his first roles. I give THE SHOW 5 stars, but the version I got I would give 1 star. If you love Bae Yong Joon and want to see this masterpiece I suggest downloading the files on dramaload.com. They have proper subs.",1394064000,6,809,4.364238410596027
8441089,2,B004TYHQZK,"Everything came in very good condition, its true.. But when I went to play the DVDs I was extremely disappointed to find the subtitles written off the side of the screen where I can't see more than three words at best. I don't understand how a defect like that can exist in a product I have to pay this much money for.",1370995200,4,318,4.145161290322581
