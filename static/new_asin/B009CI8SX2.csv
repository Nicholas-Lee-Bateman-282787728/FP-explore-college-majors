8539596,5,B009CI8SX2,"Although this is an ""old"" movie the disease of alcoholism and addiction are epidemic in our country and this movie could be so helpful to aid in the understanding of the family dynamics. It truly is a family disease and this movie expresses that so very well. I would like to see it available without having it produced on demand. A little bit of advertising goes a long way and word of mouth will increase sales to make it worth the effort to produce it in bulk and have readily available for consumers. Please consider.",1427760000,2,521,4.494736842105263
8539597,5,B009CI8SX2,"This is the best movie for alcoholics, children of alcoholics, families of alcoholics, and anyone wanting to help any of these people.

8539598,5,B009CI8SX2,Please release this film on DVD. It is a valuable tool for any one in an AA or ACA situation. Apart from being a moving film it really gets it right about drink and drug abuse in the family. I believe it won the Scott Newman Award for the best drama of 1986 dealing with substance abuse.  We have been waiting such a long time for CBS to get it out there!,1394150400,3,355,3.9305555555555554
8539599,5,B009CI8SX2,"This is an amazing film that literally describes an alcoholic family perfectly. As a drug and alcohol counselor I used it a lot for my family sessions.  I would so like to see it become available for purchase! I would buy it at almost any price, that is how good it is!",1378080000,2,269,4.173076923076923
8539600,5,B009CI8SX2,"This movie is one of the best depictions of alcoholism and drug addiction I've ever seen. Whoever wrote the script either, sadly, lived this or did a tremendous amount of gut-wrenching research.  The family aspect of addiction, which includes alcoholism, is so often overlooked. This movie shows it in all it's horror. It should be in the video library of every treatment center and every school health class in America. It should be required in medical school.  I wish the movie was more readily available.",1351728000,8,507,4.952941176470588
