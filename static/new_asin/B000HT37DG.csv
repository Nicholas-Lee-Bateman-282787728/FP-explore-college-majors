8552436,4,B000HT37DG,"This was a well done independent film. The acting was decent and the storyline was good with a twist at the end that will leave you a little surprised. It's got what every good flick needs -  money, love, sex wrapped in a good plot. It was shot in Detroit so if you're from there you'll probably recognize some of the spots. It's worth seeing, so check it out.",1226361600,,360,4.217391304347826
