2185594,1,B0006H31B2,"hoodrats is about these two guys who constantly get in trouble with the law. a figure named jimmy, whom i don't believe that they specified how he was related to these guys, has a ""package"" that he is delivering to the two young men, who have no clue as to what is inside, or so they say. the police find them on the street and question them about this package. they deny knowing anything about it and get a little abused by the police. after they are let out they find two young women, whom came off to me as prostitutes, and pick them up. as things are getting steamy in the boys' house, two ex-cons break in, armed with guns and knives, for this ""package."" they deny knowing anything about it and the scene goes on for nearly a half hour with the men threatening to rape one of the women and pointing their guns at the boys. somehow they manage to get away and kill the two ex-cons and dump them off on the highway. the movie ends with the two boys on the same street as the beginning, and jimmy comes up to them to tell them that he dropped off the package at the wrong adress. then three girls(the ones on the cover) pass by them and the movie ends. i have seen many movies, good and bad, but this had to be the worst movie i have ever seen. the camera wasn't very steady, as when the angle is from one of the criminals' view as it is moving back and forth among the people in the room it is very shaky and not done right. also the movie had almost no point, and made hardly any sense whatsoever. i found myself falling asleep throughout the movie but stayed awake to see the pathetic ending. also the three ladies on the cover are not seen in the movie until the end, where they only walk by and aren't even in any closeups. i rented this movie because it seemed like the teen movie thirteen, but was nothing of the sort. i recommend you stay away from this movie; the $5 rental isn't worth it.",1105747200,6,1900,4.151761517615176

8041611,1,B0006H31B2,"some garbage and who ever made this movie must of had some free time and didn't know what to do with it. as you can see the weapons used were pellet guns, what else can I say.",1441843200,,175,3.7567567567567566

8041613,2,B0006H31B2,I knew this movie would be a low budget film and I was not expecting much and that is exactly what I got at the most it was filmed in two locations a street corner for 15 minutes and about 45 thru 1 hour in a living room I give this movie 2 stars because 1 star is just to mean,1260835200,,277,3.557377049180328
8041614,5,B0006H31B2,"Okay, it's not a good movie but I have to give the guys credit for getting it done with little to no money.  We are all Know-It-All Monday Morning Critics but how many of us actually get out there and pick up a camera?",1237420800,,218,3.9545454545454546
8041615,1,B0006H31B2,"I just watched this movie with my 14 year old son thinking it would be about young gangster life and it was the most boring dumbest movie we ever seen. Shot on a $1.52 budget It was shot on about 6 takes meaning each scene was a continuous shot, camera moving back and forth and around players in the movie(these r not actors)  Each scene could have been tied up in about 45 seconds but instead dragged out for about 20 minutes of circular B.S.ing.  My son and I would look at each other and laugh at just how lame and this was.  The highlight to us was in the scene where the 2 main players are parting with the girls, they are jacked by two other guys looking for this ""package"" One of them has a gun and knife in each hand.  He fumbels and juggles the knife and finally puts it down, since it was about 15 minuets into a continuous shot, he almost blew it.
All in all there is no story, no action, just a waste of $5.00
  THIS MOVIE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR SOMEONE WITH INSOMNIA",1217376000,4,978,4.0942408376963355
8041616,1,B0006H31B2,"I was rummaging in the Walmart $5 DVD bin and saw this one and decided to buy it to see what it was about.  Big mistake.  This is the worst, most stupid movie I have ever seen.  The actors must have been dragged off the street. Do not waste your time even thinking about it.",1215043200,,274,3.9454545454545453
8041617,1,B0006H31B2,"Si alguna vez lees esto Edgar, tu amigo Marco A. del colegio en Ecuador te pide que hagas algo mas fidedigno, no he visto la pelicula pero las criticas lo dicen mucho.

Maybe next time you'll have your own revenge with yourself buddy, poor try, but I repeat again, next time bro just for this cause.",1154476800,,299,4.339285714285714
8041618,1,B0006H31B2,"I like to first start off that I'm Latino and love Latino cinema and movies about Latino urban life such as Blood in, Blood out. I enjoy many movies and a very easy critic.  This movie is horrible.  Very low budget. I think the film crew had about 2 cameras. I took two years of film making in high school and if I had there equipment, with thier so-so actors, I can make a better movie than this.  There's one scene were the two guys and two girls are talking and all the camera man does is rotate around them!!! No close ups, MDs, no mixing anything up.  This combined with lame dialog, and sterotypical Californian Mexican acting.  The director and producer have Latino last names and they potrayed our people really bad. And what's up with the title??? Just by reading the title ""Hood Rats"" and looking at the cover I thought it was about Latina gang-bangers or bust downs in the hood.  None what so ever!!! LAME!",1123200000,2,917,4.396449704142012
8041619,1,B0006H31B2,Zero Stars!!! The Director & Studio Exec who made this movie should be shot.  This movie is the absolute worst movie I ever saw.  This movie is a disgrace to the Hispanic Race.  Even Gang Bangers should be ashamed!!!!!!,1114819200,6,219,4.564102564102564
