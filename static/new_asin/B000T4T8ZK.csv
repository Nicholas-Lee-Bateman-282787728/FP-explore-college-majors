The last volume left us on a real cliff hanger and this one doesn't dissapoint.

With the chase involving Arkenphal and Guyot coming to a fasinating conclusion, the climax of Sho's efforts to gain control of the creators ship, and the ever scheaming Aptom still on the loose, there's plenty to keep fans the on the edge of their seats. Some glorious battle animations and quality voice acting make this lastest volume a thrilling complimation of ultra-violence and sci-fi drama.

My main crititism would be the whirlwind speed in which the story begins to unfold. Where previous volumes set the scene at a decent pace, this one seems to hurry the story alongrather rudley. Another, final moan is the fact that this volume only has three episodes opposed to the usual four. Which brings the value for money the DVD has to offer into questionable territory.",1207008000,,1191,5.761363636363637
