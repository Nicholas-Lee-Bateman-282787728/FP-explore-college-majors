8150494,4,B000JJ2DHA,"This is a review of Mad Love. I reviewed The Devil Doll elsewhere.
Peter Lorre plays an insane well-known surgeon in France, Dr. Gogol, in this science-fiction horror black and white 1935 film. He is passionately but madly in love with an actress called Orlac. Her husband is a well-known pianist. Orlac knows that Gogol is in love with her. He had rented a box at the theater for over forty nights and came to see her act every night. She discovers that her husband has been in a train accident and his hands have been smashed.
She requests the famous surgeon Gogol to save his hands. Gogol cannot do that because her husband's hands were smashed. He does not tell the husband and wife that he removed the smashed hands and substituted the hands of a killer who had just been guillotined. When the pianist husband recovers, his hands are no longer able to play the piano as he did previously, but like the now dead murderer who committed his murder by throwing a knife, his hands cause the husband to throw knives.
When Orlac rejects Gogols love saying she loves her husband, he decides to find a way to have her husband killed.",1499904000,2,1129,4.512195121951219

Love both of these flicks, and can't get enough of this genre....simply delicious!

Plus, the special effects are divine!  I get lost in the effects, and find myself stopping the film, and looking at the objects in the background, and such.

Buy it.  You'll love it!",1450051200,,277,4.808510638297872

8150497,5,B000JJ2DHA,"Peter Lorre has the featured role as a character who's relatively minor in the original Maurice Renard novel, ""Les Mains D'Orlac."" But he deserves all his screen time in this, one of his finest performances. He's plays an over-the-top and yet highly original Mad Doctor.

The Devil Doll is not in the same league as Mad Love, but I consider it simply a bonus feature for the Mad Love DVD. Lionel Barrymore plays a startlingly unconvincing role as an old lady throughout most of this strange little film. But it's still a sci-fi/horror classic of the 30's that's well worth having.",1390089600,2,580,4.742574257425742
8150498,4,B000JJ2DHA,"MGM was famous for family fare, glossy dramas, and intelligent musicals--but during the 1930s horror films were all the rage, so it is no surprise the studio took an occasional crack at the genre. The 1935 MAD LOVE, which debuted Peter Lorre in the United States, was considered so grotesque that no one wanted to sit through it, and it actually lost more money than the infamous FREAKS. On the other hand, the 1936 DEVIL DOLL, which starred Lionel Barrymore in drag, was so commonplace that it was difficult for audiences to stifle a yawn.

Peter Lorre, of course, came to international fame in the 1931 German shocker M, in which he played the role of a child serial killer. Once he was in the United States the film industry did not quite know what to do with him--until MGM had him more or less repeat the same acting chops for MAD LOVE, which was more or less based on Maurice Renard's ""The Hands of Orlac."" The story has been filmed numerous times.  On this occasion, Stephen Orlac (Colin Clive) is a noted pianist, his wife Yvonne (Frances Drake) is a noted actress, and Gogol (Peter Lorre) is the brilliant surgeon Yvonne calls in when her husband's hands are destroyed in a train wreck. Gogol performs a hand transplant, using the hands of a knife killer (Edward Brophy.) Gogol is also psychotically obsessed with Yvonne, and when she rejects him, he sets out to frame Stephen for murder in a way that implies the transplanted hands have a life of their own.

Critics of the day praised the performances but were tepid about the film itself, which was described as so unpleasant that it was barely watchable, and indeed MAD LOVE does have a strong streak of sexual sadism, so much so that it can still provoke more than a few winces. Over the years, however, its reputation has grown considerably, and while it isn't considered one of the essential 1930s horror films, it is certainly among the most perverse. The DVD is what I would call ""good"" rather than ""excellent"" quality; the picture elements and sound are acceptable, and the DVD offers a commentary by Steve Haberman, which would be quite good except for the fact that he persistently imitates Lorre's speech throughout.

THE DEVIL DOLL had the benefit of special effects, but what seemed new and fresh in 1936 doesn't necessarily make the grade with a modern audience, and certainly no one was ever greatly impressed by the film overall. Seventeen years ago Paul Lavond (Lionel Barrymore) was falsely accused and conviced of robbery and murder; now he has escaped and returned to Paris, determined to take his revenge on the three business partners who conspired to frame him. He teams with mad scientist Malita (the memorable Rafaela Ottiano), who is working on a means to reduce the human race to one sixth its size, and he uses Malita's minature beings to attack and kill his false accusors. Along the way he also intervenes in daughter Lorriane's (Margaret Sullivan) romance, which has taken an unfortunate turn.

Although it is well performed and unexpectedly finds Lionel Barrymore masquerading as a little old lady, THE DEVIL DOLL is not a greatly memorable film, and one viewing will probably be enough. As in the case of MAD LOVE, the picture and sound elements are good. It does not, however, have any significant bonus features. This double feature can also be purchased as part of the set HOLLYWOOD'S LEGENDS OF HORROR COLLECTION, which also includes DR. X, THE RETURN OF DR. X, MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, and THE MASK OF FU MANCHU.

8150499,1,B000JJ2DHA,"My review is only for the seperate pricing of this dvd,you are better off buying the box set called legends of horror which is cheaper and includes this movie.keep in mind that these money grubbers are selling a slim case version which comes in that box set. This dvd never had a seperate release the other movies included in that set are excellent.these other reviews pretty much covered how great of an investment it would be to buy just this film,which seems kind of bias to sell this overpriced slim case dvd that comes from a set. Mad love is a spectacular film which i highly recommend,but the devil doll is kinda cheesy and doesnt actually have dolls just shrunk people playing the dolls. So if u want to shell out the money for the dvd seperate then great otherwise i highly recommend to buy the box set which includes this and is far more collectible,as a collector buying the seperately would seem incomplete knowing it came from a box set.",1327449600,5,950,4.56140350877193
8150500,4,B000JJ2DHA,"Karl Freund's Mad Love and Tod Browning's Devil Doll, both from the 1930s, are, along with the James Whale films Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, as well as Dracula (1931), some of the best horror thrillers of that era. Mad Love (1935), starring Peter Lorre, is, as the title indicates, a tale of amour fou and if you can imagine anyone other than Peter Lorre in the part of a man crazed for love and crazy enough to do wacko things to prove it, I'd be really surprised. And Devil Doll (1936) starring Lionel Barrymore has him dressed in drag as an old woman out for revenge.

In both films, mad scientists--the staple of the time--play a major part. But while this may sound cliched, it's anything but. Freund and Browning were truly skilled directors who knew their stuff, so both movies are still a lot of fun to watch today. Lorre plays it to the max and is great; Barrymore is equally great in his old woman get-up and semi-cantankerous old lady voice. Lorre grafts a killer's hands onto his own to get the girl he wants; Barrymore hooks up with a mad scientist who's perfected a way to shrink people and animals to one-sixth their normal size in order to exact revenge on the three rich bankers who set him up for a fall. Of course Barrymore uses these tiny people to cause irreparable damage to the three traitorous former colleagues.

This DVD is a terrific deal for the money. If you love old movies with solid production values, don't pass this up. It's especially nifty to see how Browning has tiny people moving around among normal-sized people and objects. He did a really great job with this.

Lots of fun; highly recommended.",1188691200,15,1647,4.576271186440678
8150501,4,B000JJ2DHA,"MGM was not a studio famed for its horror films in the thirties but when they did make one, it was usually a gem.  Both of these films are first rate.

""Mad Love"" was the film which really launched Peter Lorre in America.  It is a riveting story of a pianist who loses his hands in a train crash.  Lorre plays a doctor who replaces the pianist's hands with a murderer's. He does so because he is obsessed with the pianist's wife, played by the long forgotten but excellent Frances Drake. The film is one of a few directed by the famous cinematographer Karl Freund and the camera work is stunning. The DVD comes with the original theatrical trailer and an excellent commentary.

""The Devil Doll' is almost as good. It is again a riveting story, a remake of Lon Chaney's famous ""The Unholy Three"". Lionel Barrymore plays an innocent convict who escapes prison, wreaks revenge on the real culprits and ultimately is declared innocent. If Barrymore lacks the sympathy which Chaney generated, it is still a gripping tale with excellent special effects. The original trailer is included.

Both films benefit from high MGM production values and the prints are in excellent condition.",1187654400,7,1176,4.768472906403941
