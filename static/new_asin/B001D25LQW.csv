8290984,4,B001D25LQW,"With the manga being one of the first big cyberpunk hit titles among Japanese comics, an anime adaptation was a sure bet, largely due to the success of the Akira movie and the Bubblegum Crisis OVA. Being Kia Asamiya's first big hit, this ""cyber/psychic movie""(as it was billed)caught on with fans of Blade Runner and the early 90s dawn of anime as it was spreading through America. It was first released out in America through Streamline Pictures on dubbed VHS, as well as getting a limited theatrical released double-feature with Neo Tokyo. The film was later re-dubbed and reformatted for DVD by Bandai Entertainment.

 First starting in 2028, interdimensional creatures known as Lucifer-Hawks have been periodically attacking the city of Tokyo, and the main defense against this is a special police team of cyborgs and psychics named the Attacked Mystification Police, or ""AMP"". Their best soldier is Katsumi Liqueur, a high-level psychic armed with a living Witchblade-like weapon. As Katsumi is about to fight what is thought to be the main Lucifer-Hawk, the story then cuts ahead to 2024, and the majority of the film shows how Katsumi first became familiar with AMP and the threat the Lucifer-Hawks pose as her mother sacrifices her life to seal the monster away. Flash-forward back to 2028, Katsumi concludes with her getting revenge on the revived Lucifer-Hawk.

 The movie gained enough fame to get a sequel, which was in fact a midquel taking place after the flashback majority of the first flick. It became a sleeper hit among American otaku, although it was about a decade until another anime series was made based on the manga. When you break it all down, Silent Mobius is what an all-female Ghostbusters movie should be, while mixed in with Ghost In The Shell!",1484265600,,1775,4.966329966329966

8290987,5,B001D25LQW,One of the first anime stories that I ever loved. I had this on a bootleg video way back in the 90's. I am glad to own it again.,1446595200,,128,3.4482758620689653
8290988,4,B001D25LQW,"I love this anime and can't wait for it to be released onto Blu-ray. It has an interesting story and cult concepts that I find intriguing has an occultist. Though some of it is in the realm of fantasy the incantation and symbolism of Katsumi's magic is fascinating. Plus the mixture of different philosophies, mysticism, and science. I would love to own the 2nd movie but I really want to get them both on Blu-ray.",1436832000,,414,4.533333333333333

8290990,5,B001D25LQW,"I've been a big Mobius fan for quite a while, and I had watched the show, and read most of the comics before seeing the first film. Keeping it pretty short, it's a pretty cool movie. I really don't have too much to say on it, other than that it's a good film, and fans should really enjoy it.",1389657600,,292,3.9661016949152543
8290991,5,B001D25LQW,"Not as well-known over here as many series, 'Silent Moebius' has a dedicated fan following all its own. Being the story of a group of female detectives in a near-future, 'Blade Runner'-influenced (though not nearly as much as 'Bubblegum Crisis') Tokyo whose job is dealing with crimes and incidents of supernatural origin. Like many manga-based films of the era, SM:TMP assumes the viewer has at least a basic knowledge of the characters and situations going into the film. Set consists of the film on one disk (including the film's theatrical trailers), and the film score on the second. A nicely-illustrated tin box replaces the standard DVD case for the package. The translation of the dialogue--in subtitles or voice--is a considerably improvement over the first release in the 1990s. good value, great story, well told in the manga's distinctive style.",1355702400,4,857,5.172661870503597
