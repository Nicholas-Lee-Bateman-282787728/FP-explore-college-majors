8631120,4,B00H96KFV2,"Paul Muni was considered to be the greatest character actor of his day (i.e. the 1930s-early40s).  He was the original SCARFACE, starred in such classics as I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG, THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA and THE GOOD EARTH, and won an Academy Award for his performance in THE STORY OF LOUIS PASTEUR (1936).  Over his entire career, he only appeared in twenty-one movies.

STRANGER ON THE PROWL (1953) was one of the last two films that he made; the only one shot in a foreign country.  It was directed by then blacklisted director Joseph Losey and, although there is a lot to like about this picture, it is not one of the actors more memorable efforts.

The story, set in post-war Italy, finds Muni playing a hungry vagrant who, in the process of stealing some bread, accidentally kills the storeowner.  Fleeing the police, he is befriended by a young boy (Vittorio Manunta), who had filched milk from the same shop and has decided to escape with him.

Though the conclusion of Ben Barzmans screenplay is foreseeable, the film does hold ones interest throughout its 87 minute running time.  Muni, playing a role that might have been better suited to John Garfield had it been made in America a few years earlier, turns in a fine performance, but he is not given much more to do than look moody.  There are no juicy scenes for him to play or brilliant speeches for him to deliver, and that is a waste of a great talent.

Joan Lorring co-stars in the movie, playing a household maid who briefly befriends Muni,

Perhaps the most memorable aspect of STRANGER ON THE PROWL is Henri Alekans stark cinematography of the still war-scarred Italian streets.
