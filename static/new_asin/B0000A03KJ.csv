7994933,1,B0000A03KJ,"Are you serious?!  To begin, just take a look at the promo cover: What does that shot have to do with the movie?  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!! It's a shot from what looks like the inside of a  prison, and if I only would have paused for a second I would've thought about why Estrada is wearing a members jacket with the others in issues.  And it only gets worse from there!  The acting is stiff, the directing is lost (uh, what do we shoot now) and the dialogue comes from out of nowhere!!  To me it was like a bad accident, could not look away.  Waste of time, waste of money for those who made it, and possibly a waste towards any actors involved who might have thought it could have helped their careers.  What a shame.  And to think that there are even any reviews with more than one star (which even at that rating is a stretch), just goes to show how easily  the public buys into crap and can be easily ""entertained""  - baa, baaa, baaa.
Now on to Youtube, finding something like kitties taking a nap to watch will be a far better way to spend my time than watch something like this",1431129600,,1082,4.203883495145631

7994935,1,B0000A03KJ,"This film has no redeeming qualities.  The acting, script, cinematography, editing and directing are all very amateur.  I tried it because of the positive reviews.  I turned it off after five minutes of pain.",1409961600,,208,5.0588235294117645
7994936,5,B0000A03KJ,"I loved the movie but the ending was just mean! It left you hanging, like, uh, what happened next?! I cried!! And when I bought it, I didn't know that it was based on a true story and when you don't know  that when you start watching it, and you come to the end where it tells you, it's just like ""wow...that's so sad."" I think for the times, it portrayed racism pretty well.",1388448000,,375,4.0675675675675675
7994937,5,B0000A03KJ,"Gang movies can be a little over done sometimes, but this movie was really good. Even tho I am not a fan of gang movies, this one was worth the time watching.",1368576000,,158,3.96875
7994938,3,B0000A03KJ,"Ok this is movie has a bit of drama with martial arts which is cool but with a little more work on the storyline this movie could have been a lot better. I expected more from Joon B Kim after watching him in Street Soldiers with Jun Chong but I guess he didn't have the same fight chereographer which would have made the difference although I still think he is a good martial artist.

Erik Estrada stars in this gripping drama where one young teenager is forced to use his martial arts skills in a daily to daily basis, agonizing his struggle to survive! For Paul (Joon B Kim), an asian immigrant, America has not proved to be the 'land of opportunity' but rather a deadly nightmare! His father (Master Hee Il Cho) is crippled in a robbery at his family's convienient store and becomes an abusive drunk and his mother runs off after putting up with enough abuse and marries a stranger...an American! (Erik Estrada). Although he tries to fit in, Paul is always being bullied by the local gang wherever he goes. Alone, rebellious and angry he is forced to fight. With his martial arts skills, he wages a war against his enemies - a war that results in an explosive battle with the leader of the gang ... the only son of the man his mother has married!

Good fight scenes with a bit of reality to them, bad acting but is not unnatural for a B-movie.",1134691200,2,1346,4.38
