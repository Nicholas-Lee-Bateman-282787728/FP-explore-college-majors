8240143,5,B001139ZIS,"This film will take you away from your world and plant you into one so amazingly different, it will daze and dazzle you. Life is harsh in this wintry landscape where poverty is the rule and violence lurks around every corner, yet love - love is the same everywhere. And the deep love of a quiet man for his lost soul mate renders you speechless. When placed against the stark background of the beautifully filmed snow landscape, you will remain enchanted long after the movie is over.",1375488000,4,484,4.574712643678161
8240144,5,B001139ZIS,"The movie ""My Beautiful Jinjiimaa"" has something of a soap opera look, but the acting is far above that of a daily soap. The tragic love theme is portrayed in such a way that you give in completely to its victims, hoping and praying that life's fate isn't so cruel toward love.

With the Mongolian winter as it's backdrop, the movie treats your heart like a candle in a drafty room, one minute lighting its wick to brighten up the place, and the next minute blowing all hope and promise to the wind.

It's an emotional rollercoaster that can easilly produce tears of joy and pain.  And if the story and acting don't get your tear ducts moist, just wait until the theme song kicks into full gear. ""JIN-JI-I-MAA""  Honestly, by the time this movie ended I, a contact sports nut and emotional hoover dam, was feeling the water buildup behind the eyes.  Whew! that was close.",1319414400,5,870,4.515923566878981
8240145,5,B001139ZIS,"This film tells the story of love and survival between three people.  It also touches on the theme of adoption.  A woman who is raped raises a daughter on her own, while the man who stood for her honor is in jail, wrongfully convicted.  He does his time and sees her waiting for him as he is released.  The story in the main is about the way their lives seem to conspire to keep them star-crossed lovers, but in the end there is happiness.  The little girl grows up to become a woman and plays her part in the couple finally coming together.  The film also seems to relegate the couple's unity in love to fate and chance.  The movie might make you cry, but it is a testimony to the enduring human spirit and the capacity of people to love beyond conventional boundaries.  In this sense, it carries a theme of great significance and universal potentiality and importance.  I also found the theme song touching and beautiful.  World films have such power to enliven creativity and to refresh the spirit.",1240185600,8,1001,4.480662983425415

8240147,5,B001139ZIS,"The movie is a great depiction of life in Mongolian countryside 5-50 years ago, although little has changed since.  It accurately depicts the level of understanding and the communiction style Mongolians have for each other.  Well-made movie.  Good acting by Jinjiimaa.  Great title track.  Nice scenary.  Interesting blend of old traditional nomadic ways mixing with cars and modernization (especially in the city)",1206748800,10,414,5.596774193548387
