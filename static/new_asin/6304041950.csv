763805,5,6304041950,"I am lucky in that I used to live in Oxford, so when I watch Morse I know exactly where He is but the filming of this took place mostly in Whytham Woods, a place very near to where I lived but only visited once.  I also am  aquainted with the real people the main roles were based on.  I got so  sucked into the plot that I half belived it was the real people I know that  were the villians!!  For me this film is a "" must see"" but then  all morse films in my view are ""to die for""!",939427200,5,482,3.6666666666666665

763954,5,6304041950,I love this series.  It is one of the reasons I signed up for Prime membership.  The stories are well written the the actors are very good.,1481328000,,139,4.111111111111111
763955,4,6304041950,I enjoy British TV much more than recent American efforts. I had heard a lot about Insp. Morse as the seed for many spin off shows that I really enjoy.  Imagine my disappointment when the seed source piece for so many enjoyable spin offs doesn't meet expectations.  While still very good it doesn't meet the standards set by Endeavor and Inspector Lewis siblings to the Inspector Morse original. In this case the off shoots have over shadowed the parent.,1481155200,2,454,4.734177215189874

763959,3,6304041950,"I decided to watch this Inspector Morse after having viewed the newer Inspector Morse in the more recent series called ""Endeavor"". These are series produced for the Masterpiece Theater and aired on the PBS network.

You have to pay for a monthly subscription to the Acorn Network in addition to your Amazon Prime membership for the older Inspector Morse. Not with the newer Inspector Morse in ""Endeavor"".

John Thaw is the original Inspector Morse, based on the novels written by Colin Dexter. The original series ran from 1987 to 2000. Shaun Evans is the newer, fresher Inspector Morse in the ""Endeavor"" series. I like the older Inspector Morse but am more impressed with the newer, fresher Inspector Morse. I am an avid Sherlock Holmes fan! If you are, too, I know you will like the newer version better.

John Thaw's character is a typical, older Englishman with a drinking problem and loves to hit on single women he is questioning. Hey, he is a single, older man. He may as well give it a shot.
Kevin Whatley plays John Thaw's(Inspector Morse) sidekick, Sergeant Lewis. Does an excellent job and brings a fresh, easier going character to the series. Actually, saves Inspector Morse's butt many times. Has a great sense of humor and memory which he uses on Inspector Morse.

If you watch this and like it, you will love the ""Endeavor"" series. Unfortunately, there are only 3 seasons of this one. The last episode will truly leave you wanting more! Great news, there will be a 4th series released to PBS this year! At least, that is what the press releases are saying. It is to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the radio and TV series. I am eagerly awaiting its release.

p.s. 2 tidbits of trivia for you. The love of crossword puzzles by both of the Inspector Morses comes from Colin Dexter's love of them, too. And, Colin Dexter was so impressed with Shaun Evans( wasn't easy replacing John Thaw), Colin Dexter had it placed in his will that nobody else would portray the Inspector Morse until 70 years after the execution of the will. Awesome! BTW. Colin Dexter is 86 and still alive! Yay!",1478304000,4,2096,4.700272479564033
764009,4,6304041950,Love this series but found this first episode a little confusing.  But I've many more episodes and they are so much better than American TV.,1477526400,,140,4.6
764010,5,6304041950,"I have watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes. There were many times I found Morse incredibly grumpy especially in his treatment towards Lewis, his poor long suffering partner. I enjoyed watching Morse and cried like a baby at the last episode.",1477526400,,249,4.9523809523809526

764018,4,6304041950,"I like Morse's off beat , almost non-chalant attitude.  And he approaches each case with an almost disengaged/not again facial expression, but that gets you into the video trying to figure out what he's going to do or say!  I like his side-kick, the one who is the detective in another video! But I really like British drama videos, especially the detective ones!  LOVE them!",1474588800,2,375,4.7384615384615385
764049,5,6304041950,Morse seems real with all his flaws.  The ending show of this series is the best I've seen.  Felt like a beloved friend died.,1474156800,,125,4.166666666666667

764055,3,6304041950,It's OK but may have liked it better if I had not seen Inspector Lewis first.  Inspector Morse has too many characters and hard to understand the speech of some people.,1473465600,,168,4.419354838709677

764098,4,6304041950,"In watching this series for the second time, I can see that the later series are more enjoyable because the relationship between Morse and Lewis develops and becomes deeper. All the characters develop more and it's easier to grasp the structure of the episodes. The first series seems a bit plodding at times compared to later series and it can be difficult to ""get into"" each plot. In my experience this gets easier and more enjoyable the more you stick with Morse. So, if you didn't enjoy the first series, I wouldn't give up on Morse yet.",1470787200,6,541,4.587628865979381

764140,4,6304041950,"While a bit dated at 1987, it is well done and enticed me to watch more seasons and move on to the up-to-date Inspector Lewis. Must pay close attention or miss the line of the story. Always complex.",1470700800,,198,4.2368421052631575

Later: OK so now I've watched the first series, and I am disappointed! I am finding Morse irritating and his stupidity around women rather boring. His reasoning actually holds very little that is enticing or unique. Definitely not up to the Lewis and Hathaway follow ups!
Later still! : Ok it gets better so perhaps I'd better hold off of my ratings for a while, until my opinion has settled down............",1469232000,5,500,4.566666666666666

764613,5,6304041950,"This is the beginning of a fabulous TV mystery series. John Thaw (now deceased) is incredible as the erudite and irascible Inspector Morse. In an interview, Thaw describes Morse as ""a poor policeman but a good detective"".

""Inspector Morse"" has a wonderful musical theme, and the instruments usually spell out M.O.R.S.E. in Morse code. According to Barrington Pheloung, in the TV special ""The Making of Morse"", he played around with this a bit. In some episodes, the Morse code spells out the name of the murderer OR a cryptic version of the killer's name OR the name of an innocent person. If another viewer has a better ear than me, I would love to hear about your discoveries of a Morse episode where the theme music spells out something other than M.O.R.S.E.
M........O...........R..........S.........E

THE DEAD OF JERICHO
This episode shows us three of what will become Morse hallmarks: He is unlucky in love. He doesn't give out his first name. And when Detective Sergeant Lewis accompanies him to the pub, Lewis usually ends up paying.

Morse is late to choir practice. He's got his eye on another choir member, Anne Stavely. He walks her home and she says, ""You know, I don't know your first name.""
Morse: ""That's right.""
Anne, ""So?""
Morse, ""I don't use it.""
Anne, ""That's silly!""
Morse, ""It's my parents who were silly.""
On the night of their concert, Morse arrives at Anne's home to pick her up. The door is open and he calls to her. But there is no answer and he eventually has to leave alone. She never shows up, and after the concert he finds out why. She's been found hanging in her bedroom. Morse cannot believe that it could be suicide. Lewis asks an important question: ""Did Sophocles do it?""

Trivia: Colin Dexter, author of the Inspector Morse mystery novels, has a walk-on on all but 3 ""Inspector Morse"" episodes. This time, he's a passerby in a scene with Morse and Ned Murdock. Morse has great trouble viewing Anne's body. Not only because of his personal association with her, but because he has a mild phobia of dead bodies. He also doesn't handle blood very well, and is scared of heights (hypsophobia) and flying (aerophobia).

THE SILENT WORLD OF NICOLAS QUINN
It starts with a cocktail reception at the Foreign Examination Syndicate. Nicolas Quinn, who works at the syndicate, spends most of the reception adjusting his hearing aid. He leaves the reception with another employee, Philip Ogleby, telling Philip that Roope and Tom Bartlett are selling exam secrets, something he'd figured out because he can read lips. The following Monday, Quinn's body is found at his home, and Morse is sure that it is murder. Does Morse's Law apply? As he tells Lewis: ""You know Morse's Law? There's always a 50/50 chance that the man who found the body, did the deed.""

This is the first episode where we see Morse with one of his passions, crossword puzzles. He interviews the sly Ogleby and finds out that Ogleby is Daedelus, a demon crossword setter who frequently bedevils Morse with his 5 Down. But is Ogleby too clever?

Trivia: Dexter knew a bit about deafness. He was grammar school classics teacher until 1966, when he was forced to retire by the onset of deafness. He then took a post as Senior Assistant Secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE). That's not exactly the same as the type of examinations held by the Syndicate in this episode, but there are similarities.
Colin Dexter is a dedicated crossword puzzler himself. He named his two main characters after his favorite crossword compilers, Sir Jeremy Morse and Mrs. B. Lewis!
Dexter's walk-on occurs during the beginning cocktail party.

SERVICE OF THE ALL DEAD
Morse and Lewis are called to the church of St. Oswald's. The body of church warden Harry Josephs lies in the vestry, stabbed through the chest. They figure the killer was a tramp named Swan, who was at the service, according to the few congregants who attended. Then Max, the rumpled pathologist who admires Morse and meets him head to head, drops a bombshell. Josephs was dead from a large dose of morphine mixed with wine - before he was stabbed.

Curiouser and curiouser. Morse tells Lewis, ""I'm not supposing anything until I've had at least two pints of beer."" Another hallmark of Inspector Morse. A pint, as he says, helps him think. Morse goes to the church to ask Vicar Lionel Pawlin to come down to the station for questioning. Then follows one of the most memorable scenes in the Morse canon, set to haunting music. (Which scene I won't give away.)

Trivia: This is the first episode, though not the last, where we see Morse's fear of heights. Dexter's walk-on is when Morse visits the Archdeacon; Dexter stands by a woman with a bike.

Highly recommended mystery series.

764961,5,6304041950,"The Inspector Morse mysteries are among my favorite.  John Thaw brings Morse to life in this series.  Thaw was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years.

John Thaw, as Morse, is a primary reason as to why this series is so popular. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captures the policeman's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?

This first season introduces us ably to Morse and the series with its haunting, memorable music, and fine English settings.  It is very well done and a classic which will be watched over and over again.  Morse makes the show with his brusque and brooding nature, erudite leanings, love for opera and gallantry towards the opposite sex.  He is not your typical detective, and we love him for his uniqueness.",1402272000,2,1258,4.665158371040724

I like this one and will probably buy more as funds permit although I like the interaction between Inspector Lewis and his Sergeant Hathaway better than that of Morse and Lewis as his sergeant (at least in this first episode - maybe it will improve later).",1385942400,,361,4.388059701492537
765076,4,6304041950,"Morse is simply the best police drama from Great Britain since Conan Doyle gave life to Sherlock Holmes.  I must also suggest he, Morse, requires your full attention when viewing the hour and forty-five minute production; the detective inspector is, admittedly, an acquired taste.  Morse has a penchant for classical music, the louder the better, and a pint of beer (to allow his thoughts to focus more clearly on the clues at hand). He is quick to correct his partner, Sgt. Lewis, in referring to the deceased victim in the past tense and not in the present tense as Lewis habitually does - ""the dead WAS a husband and father, Lewis, not IS ..."".  If you love working jigsaw puzzles you will be well taken by these productions, the first ten, fifteen minutes the many characters are presented in snippets of activity that seemingly are unrelated, but you know these are necessary parts of the puzzle that Morse will locate a nearby pub and ""clear his head"" to do justice, find cause, and prevail in solving the evil deed.  The city of Oxford is the background, the acting is always top quality, and JohnThaw is perfectly cast.",1385164800,2,1127,4.7055837563451774

765156,5,6304041950,"I'm working backwards in that I watched the Inspector Lewis series first, and came to know that DI Lewis used to be DS Lewis when he was working for DCI Morse. I love the Inspector Lewis series, and when I read the glowing reviews of the Inspector Morse series, I knew I had to check it out. Luckily, my local library carries the entire Morse series, so I promptly checked out a couple of the available DVDs.

I watched ""Through the Woods"" today and was very impressed at the quality of writing, not to mention the impeccable casting. John Thaw is a consummate detective who works tirelessly to get at the truth. In this episode, a man convicted as the Lovers Lane Killer, is killed in a prison fight. Although five victims were attributed to this killer whose name is Parnell, the fifth victim, Karen Anderson's body has never been found. Morse's rival and antagonist DI Johnson believes that Karen's body is at the bottom of the lake at Blenheim, but Morse is adamant in that not only is the body not at the bottom of the lake, it is buried somewhere in Wytham Woods. Morse also believes that Parnell is not Karen's killer.

Meanwhile DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) struggles between his loyalty to DCI Morse and a possible promotion if he leaves Morse and joins Johnson at regional headquarters. Lewis feels that Morse takes him for granted, feelings which are only exacerbated by Johnson's constant needling.

The plot is tightly-knit, and there are plenty of red herrings scattered throughout the story. As the story progresses, one suspect after another crops up and is just as easily eliminated, leaving the viewer puzzling out the identity of the elusive killer. When the killer is finally unmasked thanks to Morse's unflagging persistence, it comes as quite a surprise, making this a truly riveting detective drama. I can't wait to watch the rest of the Morse episodes!",1320105600,,1872,4.771604938271605
765252,5,6304041950,"This excellent A&E and PBS Mystery sets two parallel stories of mistakes against each other. The irascible Inspector Morse has just returned from leave to discover that his sergeant, Lewis, and another Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) insist that they solved the murder of five people, the alleged murderer confessed to all the murders and was tried and convicted, he was killed while in prison; however, while dying, he claimed that he only killed four of the people, not a woman whose body was never found. Morse insists that the other DCI and Lewis were wrong; the murderer did not kill the woman. He argues that the two overlooked evidence; they closed their minds after the other DCI forced the murderer to confess. This creates a strain between Morse and his superior officer, the other DCI, and Lewis, including a shouting match between Morse and Lewis. Morse's superior officer tells him to leave the case alone, ""it is closed,"" but true to his nature, Morse pursues it. While doing so, Morse suspects one person and then another and then still another, making mistake after mistake, and creating twists and turns in the film. He also misjudges people, men and women, including Lewis.",1293494400,,1191,4.930348258706467
765253,5,6304041950,"All episdes in this series are either very good or excellent.  This one is near the end of the run--and is  based, on Colin Dexter's book.  The characters are great, as usual. the story tight, the outcome (who did it) satisfying.  One problem: I was unable to find Colin Dexter's appearance.",1253318400,,291,4.647058823529412
765254,5,6304041950,"Why pure?  Because this is a linear mystery, with multiple plausible suspects and a kicker ending.  It's pure because Morse is in his element--tilting with his superior, attending chamber music concerts in his tuxedo and encountering women in whom he might, ultimately, have a personal interest.  It's pure because the core of the story concerns his relationship with Lewis.  Lewis has been involved in an earlier investigation with the obnoxious and arrogant DCI Johnson.  A murderer has disavowed his earlier confession of guilt for a murder (the fifth; he's responsible for the first four).  Morse wants to press on and reopen the investigation.  Johnson is indignant, angry and combative. The Thames Valley administration wants to keep everything swept under the rug.  Lewis is caught in between.  Johnson dangles a promotion in front of Lewis' eyes and feeds his concerns that Morse doesn't fully appreciate him or utilize him well.  You can guess the rest.  The ending brings Lewis and Morse together in an Oxford wood, with a dead body and with the victim's killer, armed with a shotgun.  There's blood all over the place and the potential for more.  Then comes the very satisfying but still unsettling ending.",1251417600,2,1217,5.085858585858586

765256,5,6304041950,"This episode provides yet another wrinkle in the Morse series.  Over and above the mystery itself, are confrontations that run throughout this entry - between Superintendent Strange, Detective Chief Inspector Johnson, Sergeant Lewis and of course Morse.  They don't take sides but rather clash within themselves, two or three at a time, frequently changing allegiances.  This by play adds much to the story. As for the mystery:  a prison inmate indicates, before his death, he did not kill the last of the five women he is incarcerated for.  Johnson insists he did kill her while Morse is skeptical.  Johnson, the investigating officer, has not been able to find the fifth body and is removed from the case - replaced by Morse.  Morse goes over all the evidence again, finds a post card with a copy of a painting of woods in a forest by Jean Francois Millet, and concludes the missing body is located in Wytham Woods near Oxford.  Characters and suspects arrive and depart as the story unfolds including an attractive woman who owns a book shop and peaks Morse's interest, a body with only the bones remaining but alas forensics reveals it is not the body of the fifth victim.  Throw in suspected pornography as well as suspected adultery and a mega-twist in the plot and we have one of the top ten in this series.",1177027200,5,1314,4.728070175438597

The tale develops urgency as it unfolds, both from the developments in the murder case and the dynamics between Morse, Lewis, et al., all working together to produce an intense payoff.  Top-notch storytelling in every way.",1137369600,12,474,5.391891891891892

Parnell confesses to five murders but had comitted only four. It takes a death bed recantation to spur the police into action. Even then, only Morse has the perseverance to follow the thin trail of evidence to its conclusion. A ""closed case"" suddenly opens into a profound mystery worthy of the talents of DCI Morse.

Well-acted, beautifully filmed, and with typically understated British humor, ""A Walk Through the Woods"" is very engaging and enjoyable.",1120521600,7,709,5.051282051282051

765260,5,6304041950,"This mystery opens with the killing of an inmate (Parnell) who had confessed to five murders and was awaiting trial.  However, at the point of death, the inmate recanted his confession regarding the last apparent victim--- a missing young woman whose body was never found even though her handbag was retrieved.  The Parnell case had been originally investigated by Chief Inspector Johnson and Sergeant Lewis, with no involvement by Morse.  Was Parnell involved in the fifth case or merely a convenient culprit?  Morse, who had never been convinced that Parnell had murdered the missing woman, pursues his own independent (and unofficial) inquiries by questioning the man (George) who found the handbag.  As a result of Morse's indagation, George is found murdered shortly afterwards and a sordid mixture of factors emerge (pornography, adultery, and possible rape and blackmail) which may be relevant to his death and the case of the missing woman.  We are presented with several possible suspects and paths of inquiry as the two cases intersect.  This installment in the series is particularly satisfying in that the viewer is kept guessing until the end when the relevant issues are fully clarified.  One aspect of this mystery which distinguishes it from the other Morse episodes is the degree to which Morse and Lewis clash--- as Lewis expresses pent up resentment over what he regards as characteristically arrogant and unappreciative treatment by the Chief Inspector.  Ultimately, their relationship is affirmed as their collaborative efforts resolve the intertwined cases.",1103587200,16,1579,5.3603238866396765
