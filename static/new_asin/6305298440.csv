I think it is more important however to let people know that this movie deals with very serious issues...it is not a piece of fluff.  For those who are squirmish be forewarned, there is a scene of a gang rape that is very disturbing.",972345600,32,383,4.366197183098592

He is my world, my true meaning for existing. His  beauty makes me want to cry, to surrender my heart. He does things to me  that no other has ever done before. I feel as if I am in comlete nirvana  when I see his face. If only I could touch his...face...AHHH WHAT A MAN HE  IS!  And the movie was nice, too.",964569600,,469,3.84375

1008142,4,6305298440,"Steve Vilder's controversial ""Blackrock"" is a disturbing  Australian film which forces you to reach deep inside yourself and begins  to make you question your own morals.
What would you do if you witnessed  some of your friends committing an horrendous crime? What would you do if  you saw a friend being raped? Would you keep silent and pretend it never  happened? or would you go to the police?
These are the questions faced by  the protagonist Jared, played by the talented and honest Laurence Breuls.
This critically aclaimed Australian drama lays focus on not only Jared's  reactions and feelings about the crime but also on the friends and family  of who this tragedy has destroyed their lives. This movie details how each  friend comes to grips with this tragic and real crime that has been  prevalent in our society for a long time.
Blackrock confront's powerful  issues such as rape, guilt, family and peer pressures and trust/mis-trust  with such realism, that it begins to take on the feel of a real-life  documentary on the truama that these young adults are living through.
If  you get the opportunity to view this film, please don't deny yourself. The  script is powerful and focused and extremely well paced. The actors perform  their roles exceptionally well, and deliver their lines with an unflinching  raw intesity.
An Australian film which is most-worthy of adding to your  movie collection.",960508800,7,1411,4.982832618025751
1008561,4,6305298440,"Blackrock was an excelent film it was a touching movie with out beening soppy.  it is a powerful film which relates to a teenagers life and choices.  the every day choices a teenager has to make, with every action there is a reaction.  with every risk there can also come consercenses.  this is clearly demintrates in one of the actors Laurence Breuls who played Jared, first demonstration was when jared surfed on the bonnet of a car while it drives around out on control with only a peice of rope to hold on to, that could of had consercenses.  Secondly jared watching his mates rape a girl if he had acted, they might have reacted by running away.  there are many meanings in this movie that are clearly shown i recommened that teenages watch this movie, even though it is not a new age movie it really makes you question your own morals.",1092268800,2,841,4.4640522875816995
1008562,4,6305298440,"Steve Vidler's remarkable film Blackrock, tells a true story of a young women that was raped and murdered on a beach.  ""A property of the clan"" a play that reflects upon the same storyline was introduced by Nick Enright.

Jared the main character of the film decides to throw a party for his best mate ""Ricko"" who returns to Blackrock.  After walking away from the party he sits upon blackrock and witnesses the rape of a young teenage girl Tracey Warner.

Afeter waking the next morning to find that she was also murdered Jared decides to keep it to himself and say nothing.  The film shows what Jared goes through knowing this and trying to hide it.

Blackrock is a film that reflects upon everty day life, things that could happen.  It shows the way that teenagers think and feel and .",1092268800,,788,4.507042253521127
1008563,4,6305298440,"Steve vidlers film blackrock, based on the rape of a young women in newcastle and also nick enrights play 'a property of the caln', was a very disturbing yet meaningfull movie.  Black rock is based around the true story of a murder of a 14 year old girl leigh leigh.

Steve Vidler has done a remarkable job of putting this meaningfull movie together.  He has used key elements such as dealing with rape,murder, and also having to deal with cancer,in Jareds case.

The rape and murder of Tracy Warner, takes a big impact on Jared, who witnessed the rape, but , not the murder and has kept it to himself.  Jared then finds out that his best mate and surf god "" ricko""  is the found murderer of Tracy. The film Black rock is mainly a reflection on pure everyday life.  Although many people think, that won't happen to me! It may happen to any one.

I feel that any one who has watched this movie is now a whole lot wiser as to what can and may happen in our socioty.

I think that black rock is a wise choice of movie to watch as it teaches the viewer about values, and how to hold them.",1092268800,,1084,4.1980676328502415
1008564,5,6305298440,"My senior English class has read the play ""A Property of the Clan"" by Nick Enright and have just watched this film ""Blackrock"" by Steven Vidler, in order to look at the transformation of one text into another. Although I had some reservations about undertaking this unit, due to the controversial subject matter; having almost completed our study I am very pleased with my choice. Although the film does deal to some extent with the rape and murder of a young girl and is based on a true life event in the town of Newcastle, Australia, it is the responses of the teenagers and the community that become the focus of ""Blackrock"" the movie. My students have handled the subject matter of the movie with great maturity and it has given rise to some great class discussions on such  issues as power, gender, the marginalisation of women, mateship, relationships and class. Obviously it is essential to handle such subject matter with sensivity and the nature of the class group warrants consideration, but this film has proved to be a very effective teaching tool; one that I would recommend consideration by other educators. I definitely will be using it again.",1092268800,,1158,4.819095477386934
1008565,4,6305298440,"Blackrock is a very powerful movie that can relate especially to teenagers and the troubles they can face.  It is named Blackrock after the name of the town where a murder occurs on the beach.  Jared is the main character and he is throwing a party for his best buddy, surf legend Ricko who has returned in town.  However, when a girl is raped and murdered on the beach, Blackrock becomes a main site of publicity for the ""Hoodlums"" that live there.  I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Heath Ledger and he plays a small role of the kid named Toby Ackland which he plays an also disturbing role of what I like to call ""head rapist""  This is a sad, but very touching film, and the soundtrack is awesome, I definatley recommend it to anyone who finds meaning out of movies as well as entertainment.",1087948800,,806,4.311258278145695
1008566,5,6305298440,"I watched blackrock, and found it to be one of the best films ever made. The acting is amazing, and the actor that plays dave, Brendan Donoghue, is an absolutely amazing actor, and is worthy of an emmy! He is such a fantastic actor, and he plays his part so well. i rate this 5 stars! the movie has a great script, and is great for australian acting. i definitley reccomend this movie to anyone.",1085443200,,395,4.28

But I'm Dont Wanna Get The DVD Untill I Know For Sure Its Him (Even Though I Heard About This In An Aaron Carter Mag.!),1077494400,,276,3.8596491228070176
1008568,5,6305298440,"I have watched Blackrock several times and consider it a very powerful film, which would be particularly good to use in high schools.  ...  I feel that over the course of the film Ricko's image as the ""legend"" and good guy is effectively torn away and he is revealed as being seriously warped morally.  I found the scene where Ricko confesses his ""reasons"" for killing Tracy to be one of the most horrifying in the film, partly because it rang so true.  People will use the most pathetic excuses to justify the crime of rape,and I feel the movie showed well the utter emptiness of these justifications.  The movie also does not excuse Jared for his inaction in regards to the rape - but allows him the possibility to accept his guilt and try and make amends in whatever way he can.  All the actors played their parts very well and came across as believable.  As the central figure of Jared, Laurence Breuls was very convincing, showing his character's decline from fun-loving, fairly self-centred surfer boy to confused and guilt-stricken, his world tipped up around him.  The extreme insensitivity Jared shows at several points in the movie makes his character not entirely sympathetic, but is necessary to show his uncertainty about where his loyalty should lie.  Jared is no hero, he is basically a weak character, possessing a conscience but not the moral strength to act on it.  He isn't meant to be a hero though, he's meant to be real, and the film shows his desire to do the right thing after Tracy's death, but confusion about what the right thing is.  I think that an important theme of this film is how the culture in which people live can act on them to compromise their conscience in this way.",1042675200,2,1706,4.634551495016611
1008569,5,6305298440,"This movie is not for the lite hearted. I can deal with a lot, but watching this movie... I had to stop part way through to get my bounds.  For all those people who say Heath Ledger is a God, I don't really see it in this movie.  He's a great actor but when you see anybody, famous or not, gang raping a girl it's very disturbing. The flash backs of the rape just add to the movie.  How you enterpret this movie will decide how you feel about the ending.  This is a sad movie to watch.  Especially since this stuff actually happeneds.  It's a great movie, the way it was constructed.  Definatly a movie to watch, if you are not lite at heart on the subject.",998265600,3,657,4.0859375
1008570,5,6305298440,"Blackrock IS a movie about rape and loyalty to one's mates vs telling the truth, but it treats the topic deftly, not justifying the events, but showing why they occured and the effect they have on the community. It is very disturbing, especially the rape scene, but its message is NOT ""rape is okay"" or anything remotely close to that. The reprehensibility of the rape/murder and of not doing/saying anything is clearly shown, and the realistic depictions of the characters help to explain how and why events happened as they did. Truth be told, most criminals are described afterwards as ""the nicest person, last one you'd expect to do that"". The storyline can be a little confusing, though this is most likely due to the re-editing of the film prior to (or poss. after) Sundance, which took out some of the intro which explained some of the dynamics between the teens. Laurence Breuls does an especially fantastic job as Jared. The scariest thing about the film is that I can actually see it happening in real life.",975888000,3,1017,4.751412429378531

7887464,5,6305298440,Interesting film about a young man and the struggle he endures after a girl is found naked and dead on the beach after attending a rowdy homecoming party for his best friend.  This movie shows scenes of gang rape and should be avoided by those who are sensitive to such issues. I found the story to be incredibly moving and complex. I believe this movie was based on a true story as well.,1423353600,,388,4.315068493150685

7887467,4,6305298440,"I bought and watched Blackrock.  I came away from the movie as sense of change in the male image,identity and purpose. In addition to, the young girls that were effected by this tragedy, stood up and made their rage known and were not going to let what happened slip by under the covers of male privilage.  By no means does this make an excuse for the individual that kept quiet.  I did not have the background to the movie and never realized that the horrible rape and murder of the young girl actually happened in real life.  This movie is true to life around the world in that people do not value women but perhaps there is an hope for change.  Movies that are based on real life do change people's hearts and minds and no doubt that this movie is one of them.  I know I walked away with a new preception and I am grateful to all who were involved in making this film.",1210204800,,871,4.216867469879518
7887468,2,6305298440,"This film is based on the real life sadistic rape and torture of a school girl Leigh Leigh, in the Newcastle region of New South Wales.

What I found remarkably hard to understand about this (perhaps it's just me) is the 'dilemma' faced by one of the lead characters.

He and his mates are out having a party. He witnesses the rape and the killing and yet he has a 'dilemma' about reporting it because he's good mates with the perpertrator. For me there's no issue whatsoever, the brutality of the crime could not be convered up, so I had enormous difficulty understanding the motives of the central character of this film",1152316800,8,622,4.544642857142857

The best part of the movie is when Ricko jumps he should of done that at the start of the movie that way the poor girl would still be alive. Jared is one confustd little boy but he opens up in the end. the movie is about a girl that gets raped and murded there was one witness and he is not saying anything.he is asked about her and he still protects his friend{ricko}. i don't think that its right to protect some one when there is a murder involved.",1092268800,2,591,4.103448275862069
7887470,4,6305298440,"I think the movie was a bit to graphical for younger people to be viewing. But on the other it is good for people that are in senor grade in small country towens that don't have access to larg citys as this gives them an insit of what can happen to people and happens every day. I think it is a grate educationl movie as it opens peoples eyes to the fact that crimes do go on where people see and don't tell any one, and how it tars them apart. It also shows that things like rap and muder can happen like that in small towens.",1092268800,,527,3.9345794392523366
