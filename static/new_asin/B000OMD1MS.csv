Not necessarily action-packed, but lovely for background, or if you want something peaceful.",1478649600,,123,6.294117647058823

- You like animation? There's almost none.
- No story, just little chapters with few paintings (by chapter), music and sometimes little animations (Inoue-like becoming Ghibli-like by morphing when animation starts).
- You won't find the short film about Iblard that you can see in the Ghibli's museum.
- The paintings aren't new, you find them in his artbooks. And they aren't the best of his work.
- The music (the soundtrack is on a CD with the DVD) is average. I'm sad to write this because I very liked the music done for older CD-Roms of Inoue (The world of Iblard for example).

I must say that I am a huge fan of this artist. Really. But this DVD bored me a little. Making animation costs money, and that's obvious that there wasn't a lot for this film. A little video (in Japanese) shows Inoue explaining that they had to choice paintings that were easy to animate, so...

Purchase his artbooks, they are 1000000x better.",1265414400,5,974,4.528409090909091
