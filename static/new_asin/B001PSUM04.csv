3760489,4,B001PSUM04,"Given the duration of this ""series"", this is not exactly a major investment of time.  In the first episode, Takaya Murase is in the market for a robot as a lingerie model.  He overlooks all of the various, sordid designs and chooses Yui, a maid robot.  From there, Yui is shocked to discover Takaya's collection of perverted otaku, and goes on to discover a world populated with perverts both male and female.  Inevitably, Yui falls in love with Takaya despite his perversity.  It's very silly, full of barely-dressed fantasy women, but not really hardcore (glimpses of topless characters from time to time, and implied giant octopus molestations).  Along with all of the innuendo, there's a very wry humor and sense of fun.  If you've seen a good number of anim titles you'll get a kick out of this brief series, and I enjoyed the parody without the mad freneticism of Paniponi Dash.  It's a solid ""3.5 out of 5"".  Brief, but smart.

Overall, it's a celebration of perverse sensibilities, a parody of many anim titles (Yui herself is a melding of Chi from Chobits and Mahoro from Mahoromatic), fan service galore, and even has a few off-scene octopus hentai moments.  Silly fun, all too quickly over.

For some details, this disc contains three episodes of about half an hour apiece, and its special features that consist of clean opening and closing sequences, and some previews.  The animation quality is not terribly high, but it still works.  The audio is OK; all in Japanese, with English subtitles.  There wasn't much money spent in this translation, but it still works.",1237766400,40,1577,4.832089552238806

Amime is an art form that I love.. I know some Japanese. Not that fluent. But, it was one that kept my interest.",1395619200,2,275,4.0181818181818185

I generally like ecchi, but this series... I feel like it was just done WRONG. I'm probably going to be flamed, so don't expect replies if you comment on this.",1378598400,5,334,4.317460317460317
