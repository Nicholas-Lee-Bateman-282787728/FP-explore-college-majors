8256455,3,B0014VPFVI,"""TKO"" is the feature-length debut of stuntman-turned-filmmaker Declan Mulvey, who had gained a small degree of underground recognition for his short film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everyone-Is-Kung-Fu-Fighting/dp/B0000YEDNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everyone Is Kung-Fu Fighting</a>&nbsp;a while ago. On a particularly good day, this one here can be considered a decent throwback to the martial arts tournament subgenre, but on any other occasion, it's a merely passable fight flick with good ambitions but serious problems. It's no surprise to me that this one's gotten lost in the heap of DTV action flicks released during the last decade, but on the bright side, there are definitely worse ones out there.

The story: two fighters-turned-trainers - played by Daz Crawford (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-II/dp/B00005JKWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade II</a>) and Paul Green (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-Over/dp/B000EGDB1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game Over</a>) - seek combatants that will win a yearly tournament to put them in good standing with their kingpin boss (Joel King,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Town/dp/B0009A402K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Town</a>).

The plot also includes a fighter-turned-monk-turned-fighter (Chyna McCoy, who stunt-doubled Laurence Fishburne in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>) seeking vengeance for his murdered brother, and I can't help but think that this story should have taken precedence over the other one. With that said, Daz Crawford is a fairly entertaining actor and I didn't mind when the supposed-to-be-annoying Samantha Alarcon became his sidekick, `cause I found her pretty fun to watch as well. Just about everyone's a decent performer in this film, even if their characters aren't that interesting sometimes. Production-wise, things falter a bit: though overall a professional-looking feature, the art direction - featuring lots of contrasting neon colors - looks a bit flat and dull despite itself, and through some superfluous camera effect, almost every light source and reflection in the movie creates a prominent glare that's no fun to look at. Occasionally lazy filming necessitates post-production add-ins that otherwise would have been unnecessary (e.g. shaking the picture to simulate an elevator stopping).

It should be known that ""TKO"" features no less than nine separate fight choreographers in the credits, although I think this is merely a trend of the director's to let individual fighters design their own brawls. If this is true, it's not a bad idea in theory, but in the end, none of the eight fight scenes outright impressed me and only about half are what I'd consider worth watching. Next to none of the fighters are recognizable, but that's alright because almost everyone involved is packing some good moves, mainly in the form of acrobatics. That's where the potential stops, though. Breaking the norm of DTV martial arts films, it's not the overediting of post-production which squanders most of the eight fights, but rather an incorrigible camera which constantly zooms in and out of the action. It's particularly annoying during a kick-filled cage fight between capoeira exponent Edwin Villa (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pit-Fighter/dp/B0007ZEO6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pit Fighter</a>) and pseudo-vampire Vishnu Seehahai.

It's kind of weird that the movie is marketed as an MMA-style feature, since few of the fight scenes are designed this way and Daz Crawford (who used to be a boxer in real life) even takes the time to downplay grounded grappling as a realistic approach to fighting. I don't mind this, but it could alienate the audience the feature is being marketed to. With that said, I think only viewers who are decently versed in low-budget movies will readily seek out the positive aspects of this film and not dislike it as a whole, MMA fans included. It's worth a watch if your expectations aren't too high, despite bordering on a two-star rating.",1359590400,,4303,6.337883959044369
