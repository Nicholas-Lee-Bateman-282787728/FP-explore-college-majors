5522853,5,B00AWE4DNE,"Going into ""Purge,"" a 2010 cyberpunk sci-fi flick distributed by Troma Entertainment, I didn't quite know what to expect. Outside of a hot chick on the cover and a prominently-featured positive quote from someone at a Dutch film festival, it looked like another low-budget exploitation film. Of course, they say don't judge a book by its cover, so to avoid doing that, I actually decided to watch it. Thankfully, I enjoyed ""Purge"" quite a bit, and although it might not be something to recommend to everyone, fans of films such as ""Blade Runner,"" ""Dark City,"" ""Johnny Mnemonic"" or ""The Matrix"" are sure to love this one.

The story is hard to explain: it concerns Layla, a BDSM mistress living in a world where all people are artificially created through genetic engineering. People go through their days, repressing any emotion other than happiness--to express any other emotion is seen as a malfunction in genetic programming, and punishment for doing so is severe. To avoid spoiling it for you further, I'll leave it at that, but clearly there's some depth to this one. Through all of the sex and gaudy futuristic imagery, it's a pretty clever premise, and it's matched by an intelligently-written screenplay.

It's not a perfect film--the quality of the acting is inconsistent, and it's clear that this film was done on a low budget. Nonetheless, it was clearly made with care and effort, and that care and effort shows through in the final product, even if it's not the best-looking movie around. The sound is as clear as one might expect from a microbudget indie, and even though the picture quality is not perfect, it's clear enough so as to not be a real issue. Some of the special effects vary in quality--some work and some don't--but again, there's enough care and effort put in, along with some very clever concepts, that the quality of the effects isn't really much of an issue.

The disc comes with some special features--a few trailers for other Troma movies, and some featurettes, one about the movie (from the same film festival in the Netherlands as the quote on the front cover came from) and one about Troma's place in the independent film industry. Both featurettes are interesting watches and add a lot of value to the release. There are also some cool shorts on here--my favorite is a ""PSA"" about hermaphrodites, featuring Lemmy (the singer/bassist from Motorhead) and Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the creators of South Park)--which also add a lot to make this a release worth getting.

In conclusion: ""Purge"" is an interesting film. It may not be for everyone, but having grown up with ""Blade Runner"" and ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" I enjoyed it a lot. It's a fine addition to the dystopian sci-fi genre and a unique film in its own right. If you have an interest in this kind of movie, ""Purge"" definitely deserves a place in your collection.",1372118400,10,2856,4.822448979591837
5522854,5,B00AWE4DNE,"I found this to be a very unusual, interesting film. It was obviously low budget but the director made the low budget work to the film's advantage. The mock commercials and news inteviews gave a deeper insight to the kind of society it was and the unusual editing techniques gave it a unique style. The story never lost my interest and the relationship between Layla and Peta was fascinating. The use of text and titles was also interesting and unexpected.

PURGE probably won't be everyone's cup of ea, but if you like unusual, intelligent sci fi films, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",1363564800,2,591,4.794117647058823

5522872,3,B00AWE4DNE,"I really like this low budget experimental dystopian sci-fi thriller.  It almost lost me in the beginning, but gets much better by the second half.  The last half hour is pretty good.

What's hard to take in the beginning are the LSD trippy fetish scenes that go on for the better part of 30 minutes.  If you aren't into that kind of thing, it falls short of pulling you into the story.  If you ARE into that kind of thing, it doesn't give you enough of it either.  It's the kind of material that would be the background visuals at a fetish party.  It's very David Lynch-ian and interesting to watch, but hard to follow.  I couldn't tell who was who and what they were doing.  That is the reason this review is missing a few stars.

Past the first 30 minutes, things get interesting.  There are a few fascinating characters as well as some pretty powerful social commentaries in the format of news coverage.

The acting is pretty good for a low budget production.  I've seen worst. Music and special effects were pretty good as well.

The end has a nice surprise ending and a great monologue from the films antagonist.  I love that scene!",1451520000,2,1138,4.456310679611651

5522904,4,B00AWE4DNE,"Purge tells a very fascinating dystopian story the low budget way: So don't expect any big action setpieces, flashy CGI interludes, lavish sets and locations and the like. Instead Purge concentrates on the story as such, on creating a world of its own based on (sci-fi-)logic, and on characters. This is helped by camerawork that might seem a bit too flashy at times, but more often emphasizes on the emotions of film's lead character, her growing paranoia and withdrawal symptoms, to life quite beautifully. Add to this some really nice twists and turns and a thought through surprise ending, and you've got yourself a pretty good movie!",1443398400,,638,4.97196261682243

5522911,3,B00AWE4DNE,"Far from your typical Troma fare, this is more like a BBC teleplay you would have seen in the 80s or 90s. It's 1984 and Brave New World with a really small budget and a slightly different spin. It looks like an ambitious project. With a decent budget and adequate crew this could have been a much better production. The ending tagline was a little odd, comparing the purge to prejudices spawned by the conservative movement, when the [SPOILER ALERT] questionably villanous character is a  transexual(?) who seemed more on board the liberal side of things. Oh well, no one said logic was a favorite of writers with an agenda of their own.",1441670400,2,637,4.6371681415929205
5522912,1,B00AWE4DNE,"I'm only giving this movie 1 star so I can post this review. I couldn't finish this stink-bomb in one siting. I had to watch bits and pieces over several nights. In summary, the plot is just a left-wing attack on right-wingers and neocons. However, this is not expressly stated until about the last 10 minutes of the film. The filmmaker(s) is pushing an idea that does not mesh with history. Near the end of the film, the extant political system in the country where the action takes place, which is Australia by the way, is compared to Stalinist Russia and Pol Pot's Cambodia. However, those countries had well documented left-wing governments. In fact, all of the government sponsored genocides of the 20th century were perpetrated by left-wing governments (i.e. communist China, communist Soviet Union, communist Cambodia, socialist Germany). I don't understand why those who advocate a socialist/communist-style political system, like the filmmaker apparently, continue to ignore the fact that left-wing policies were responsible for the deaths of upwards of 100 million people during the 20th century. I'm all for calling out the ""right"" when they do something wrong, but let's not wear blinders and suggest that the ""left"" do no wrong.

Perhaps the filmmaker should have focused on the corporate fascism which has taken over most of our western governments. The big corporations are happy to buy any sitting politician of whatever political stripe, and the politicians, ""left"" or ""right"", are more than happy to put their hands out. The left/right dog and pony show is just in place to keep us divided: at the top, there isn't a bit of difference.",1441670400,10,1653,5.054945054945055

5522934,5,B00AWE4DNE,"Purge clever and well thought out combination of a healthy dose of Utilitarian Sci-fi with an added touch or two of tasty cyberpunk as we follow the story Layla, a BDSM mistress who lives in a reality where an artificially created population have come about through genetic engineering. People simply live without choice each day, the only emotion they are allowed to exhibit is happiness because any other show of emotion is regarded as a genetic programming  malfunction. Of course, the powers that be do not react kindly to those who rebel. Layla, with the help of the mysterious androgynous Peta and the underground resistance movement begins a journey of self-awareness as she begins to question her own place in the world.
Ahh, we've all been there; Girl is fed up with her BDSM life, Girl meets girl/boy, Girl/boy attempts to help BDSM girl to deprogram.

The plotting is nicely written and contains a wealth of interesting philosophical and psychological themes that constantly ask one to....wait for it & breathe......THINK. I know, frightening eh? Another thing that catches the eye is the way that the movie is filmed, often in in a wonderfully idiosyncratic way that borders on experimental and dare i say it....Avant-garde. It's safe to say that the effect doesn't always work, sometimes serving to detract from the plot, but in the main the style is delightfully creative and innovative.

This may be one reason as to why the film has yet to gain a firmer grasp on the public awareness - because it simply doesn't attempt to appeal to the mainstream Star Wars/Star Trek/Edge of Tomorrow audience. As I've mentioned before, please don't misunderstand this as elitist snobbery on my part, because I firmly regard myself as a fully paid up occasional member of the mainstream science fiction audience. There is a place for all types. I genuinely do believe however that people may have been put off by the terms 'experimental', 'stylised' and 'philosophical' - because while PURGE certainly does have something of an avant-garde feel to it, there is still more than enough there for it to appeal to a wider audience.

The acting, particularly from the two leads of Sarah Breen and Meda Royall are excellent - Royall in particular seems to relish her role as the androgynous and complex character of Peta. Though this is no perfect film, for the supporting cast is less assured in quality in a couple of areas, something that often occurs in micro-budget productions and seems difficult to avoid for many filmmakers . In addition, the occasional set-piece effects don't always provide the authenticity and stylised gravitas that they really should have. The result is an uneven film in parts in terms of conveying the power of what is a powerful tale.

However, still immensely enjoyable overall.
