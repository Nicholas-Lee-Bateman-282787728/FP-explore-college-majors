1621147,5,B00005LB8F,"As an avid reahcer of the manga, I love this series, althought it's fun to see how many manga stories are cut up to make one episode.  The episodes on this DVD are very touching and make a wonderful ending to the series.",1012089600,,220,4.116279069767442
1621148,5,B00005LB8F,"There are two types of people who will purchase this anime. Those who have seen AMG before, and those who haven't. For the former, I can say the DVD production quality is ""good enough"". Although other producers like Pioneer might have done better, this is as good as Animeigo, who has the rights, can do.
For those who haven't seen AMG, this is worth it whether you're a fan of anime or not. The animation is good, the music is wonderful, and most importantly the story is captivating. Throw a little fantasy into the plot and you arguably have the most enchanting romantic comedy in anime.
There's no need to take my word for it, though. AMG is a 2 hour series that was released 8 years ago in Japan and had no backing in the US from a major distributor. Yet the popularity of AMG, as reflected by web sites, is nearly on par with Princess Mononoke which was the most heavily promoted anime in US history and backed by no less than Disney.
Watch AMG and you'll understand why it continues to take on newcomers despite its age.",1001721600,5,1027,4.410526315789474
1621149,5,B00005LB8F,"Second DVD concluding the five part OVA series. Contains the last two episodes, 4 and 5, which are the longest episodes of the series. This is done by AnimEigo so you will known this DVD will be done right.
Episode 4: Evergreen Holy Night Keiichi's life finally seems to be getting back to normal (or at least as normal as life gets when you live in a temple with 3 goddesses!). Yes, he does get strange dreams, and yes, Urd and Skuld are a pain, but what the heck - his girlfriend is truly divine! Alas, System Bugs are escaping from the Heavens, upsetting the balance of the Earthly Plane.
Skuld gets on the case, and soon discovers that whenever Belldandy and Keiichi get close, a Bug Exhaust Port is formed. Until the problem is solved, Belldandy and Keiichi can't be together. Then Belldandy gets a Notice of Recall from the Lord. She has to go back to the Heavens, or else!
Episode 5: For the Love of Goddess You'd think with a goddess as a girlfriend, Keiichi's life would be Heaven, but the fact is, it's coming to resemble the other after-life address. If he even gets close to Belldandy, Bugs escape onto the Earthly Plane and foul up the works. Worse, the Lord has slapped her with a Recall Notice.
In two days, she has to relocate home to Heaven. As the clock ticks down, Belldandy must begin to erase herself from Keiichi's life and memory. And Keiichi? He's working his fingers to the bone so he can buy a ring for Belldandy. A ring that will fulfill a promise... a promise he doesn't remember making!

1621157,5,B00005LB8F,"I love this OAV series. Depending on my mood, it's either the best or the second-best anime OAV series I've seen.
Part of this is because the two main characters are just plain nice people. There's SO many anime where the main characters are annoying, stupid, stubbornly clueless, rude, or any of the above. It's not always necessary to have the main characters be clearly flawed in some way, and in this case, they aren't. If Keiichi has any flaw, it's that he's a bit too tentative around Belldandy, but can you BLAME him? She IS a goddess, after all.
And they still have conflicts and problems -- an important thing to remember when watching the show is that even for good people, prior mistakes can catch up with you.
The climactic scenes never fail to bring tears to my eyes. If you're a romantic, get this anime. You won't regret it.",1066176000,3,839,4.526315789473684
1621158,5,B00005LB8F,I love the ah! my goddess show.  It is a very fun and happy show.  It wasent as good as the movie to me but it holds its own.,1046390400,,125,3.2758620689655173
1621159,5,B00005LB8F,"The bad thing about the ""Oh My Goddess"" OAV series was that there were only five episodes created.  Having been introduced to all of the major players, these final two episodes have much less humor and take a much more serious nature.  Belldandy and Keiichi can no long come into close proximatey of each other as disasterous results happen due to system malfunctions.  To make matters worse, Belldandy is being recalled to heaven to handle the situation.  Keiichi now only has three days to buy Belldandy a ring and keep a promise he doesn't even remember.
Storywise, get the tissues ready!  Call me a sap, but I litterally could feel the pain of separation from a loved one as the story progressed.  Belldandy can't see Keiichi except from an extreme distance and so knits him a sweater -- a gift of her love since she will be forced to erase herself from his mind as well as remove the evidence she was even there.  Keiichi works every possible job he can find just to get enough money to buy Belldandy an expensive ring -- a sacrafice of self to show his love.  It is very sweet, touching, and romantic.
The DVD has the same extras as the first one.  There is the audio commentary by the English voice actors which serves as humor but little else.  I would have liked some more thoughts on when they were in the studio and coming up with script changes, but instead we get a lot of jokes to cover the serious, sad situation of the story going on.  For filler, we have the main theme played without the credits and all five closing scense with song minus credits.
While liberties are taken with the English script, the English dub is very good.  The English subtitles are even better if you are a purist in wanting to know what the Japanese are saying.  It's not perfect, but of all the official subtitling I've seen, AnimeIgo really tries hard to do it right!
Bottom line:  Fans of ""Love Hina"" or even ""Hand Maid May"" or other romantic-comedy shows will really enjoy this DVD!",1043539200,10,1980,4.494413407821229
1621160,5,B00005LB8F,"First of all, I like to say that the Oh my Goddess series, as old as it is is a very likeable anime series. When I first heard about it, I thought it sounded a bit wierd but when I watched it for the first time, it was hilarious. The whole 5 episode OAV series is wonderful and talking about right now is the DVD volume 2 containg episodes 4-5.

Longer than usual, Oh my goddess! Volume 2 talks about Keichi's and Belldandy's life after 8 months. Hilarious Skuld and flirtatious Urd now live with them in the temple but a challenge awaits Keichi's and Belldandy's love. Everytime Belldandy and Keichi get close to each other, a bug exhaust port is created and on top of them, Belldandy gets a recall notice to go back to the heavens in three days. Watch the last two episodes...I recommend it!",1040947200,3,793,4.358108108108108
1621161,5,B00005LB8F,This movie is great. It has great animation and music. The story is easy to fallow. Over all it's the best anime I've seen,1036540800,,122,4.125
1621162,5,B00005LB8F,"Okay...the final two episodes of the OVA...
There's a problem...for some reason things go haywire when Keiichi and Belldandy are close to each other...""bugs"" are messing up everything...it's up to Skuld and Urd to find a solution...and Keiichi must remember...the tension builds through both episodes, as Belldandy seems to reserve herself to the fact that she cannot be with her love...it really pulls at your heart and you can feel the sorrow and pain...but all is revealed before the end...and the ending is...
The story is just too wonderful for just 5 episodes...and that's my only problem with it...it's too short!
Of course, it's easy to own the entire series that way!  Just go on and buy them...it's worth the expense...",1028160000,,729,5.024793388429752
1621163,5,B00005LB8F,"Episodes 4 and 5, the last two of the series.  Other's have explained what happened in these in more detail then me, but I will give my review on the series.  The animation was great throughout the whole series, it didn't ""die down"" as the series progressed like I have seen in other series.  Belldandy is a truely beutiful character that I think just about any guy would love to have as a girlfriend.  Both for her looks and her personality.  The voice over actors on the english dub were very good throughout the whole series as well.
The story itself was ok.  It was really good at keeping your attention.  I couldn't wait to see what was in the next episode or how it was going to end.  Although some parts were very predictable to the outcome.  The lack of violence and nudity is what makes this series a must have.
Since this is the end of the series, how does it transition to the movie, Ah! My Goddess?  I actually watched the movie before the series, and both are seperate from each other.  You don't HAVE to see the series to understand the movie, and the series offers some closure so you don't have to see the movie, although I highly recommend it.  Although you probably should see both because there are a couple references in the movie that a lot of people might not understand if they didn't see the series.
This series is a highly recommended addition to any Anime fan's collection.  The humor, the romance (and I am not even a romance movie person), all make for a great series you can enjoy again and again.",1027814400,,1526,4.387900355871886
1621164,4,B00005LB8F,"The 4th episode...
  With the strange appearance of system bugs on Earth, mysterious events suddenly pop up. Skuld discovers that a Bug Exhaust Port forms whenever Belldandy and Keiichi are together, forcing them apart. To add to their problems, Belldandy receives a Notice of Recall from the Lord telling her to return to the heavens immediately.
The 5th episode...
  With only a few days until Belldandy's recall, Keiichi struggles to give her the ring before she leaves. Meanwhile, Urd and Skuld attempt to generate the calcucations to complete the Ultimate Magic Circle. With it, they hope to eliminate the seal around the cherry tree and correct the system imbalance, thus nullifying the Recall Notice.",1026777600,2,707,5.175438596491228
1621165,3,B00005LB8F,"After the light comedic romance of Volume 1 of the ""Oh! My Goddess"" series, Volume 2 abruptly takes a much more serious and highly melodramatic turn.  For a five-episode series, though, it is understandable that things must be brough to a crisis rather quickly.  That said, the two episodes of Volume 2, ""Evergreen Holy Night"" and ""For the Love of Goddess"" are fitting episodes to conclude the series - they show the extent to which the relationship between Keiichi and Belldandy has grown, despite their being literally from two different worlds.  The slightly twisted Urd is still here, as is the feisty Skuld, perpetually carrying around her croquet mallet.
Episode 4, ""Evergreen Holy Night,"" draws us immediately into the action.  Keiichi is having a nightmare, in which Belldandy is forced to revoke the terms of their contract and return to Heaven.  Awakening in a panic, the next day reveals the reality behind Keiichi's premonitions.  The appearance of 'bugs,' odd little rabbits with cricket legs, in their shrine home, signals some malfunction in the bridge between Earth and Heaven - and strangely manifests itself when Keiichi and Belldandy are close to each other.  From snow at Christmastime (go figure) to randomly exploding soft drink machines, Belldandy and Keiichi's relationship is a growing threat to all around them - and a recall notice from the Lord notifies Belldandy that she has indeed been called back.
Episodes 4 and 5 of the ""Oh! My Goddess"" series show Belldandy unusually disaffected, unable to do much of anything except knit, while Urd and Skuld try to figure out a way to stop the flow of 'bugs' into the material world.  These 'bugs' are the reason Skuld carries around her croquet mallet all the time, and as the plot unfolds, we get what amounts to an apocalyptic game of ""Whack-a-Mole,"" with the eternal love contract between Keiichi and Belldandy at stake.  While Urd and Skuld try to solve the 'bug' problem through science and magic, Keiichi, pursuant to his dream and the goadings of his sister, Megumi, takes up a number of odd jobs to buy a keepsake ring to give Belldandy before she is forced to return to Heaven.
A lot happens in these two episodes, and I've only given a bare outline of how each episode starts.  Though these last two episodes show touching displays of affection and perseverance, the writers are careful to preserve the individuality of each of the main characters, while introducing very few new ones so as not to distract from the main story.  Volume 2 of ""Oh! My Goddess"" is extremely melodramatic, and kind of hard to take seriously, but as I said, is decent in its own right.  I'm not sure why they didn't put all five episodes on one disc, and have the second disc contain some quality extras, but whatever.
The extras on Volume 2 are the same as on Volume 1 - a musical slide show of cels, and a 'dub your own DVD' feature.  However, Volume 2 also includes the ""Oh! My Goddess"" music videos - basically the opening and ending themes and animation from the series, independent of the episodes.  Worth owning for a completist, but if I had to choose, I would take Volume 1 instead.  Volume 2 is just way too hyperbolically downbeat for me.  I'm glad I watched it though.",1026604800,,3240,4.758928571428571

7943689,4,B00005LB8F,I like the series. I watched it when I was a kid. This dvd is only 2 episodes. There are only 2 dvd volumes so it makes it a total of 5 episodes. I wish there was more since this story of Oh My Goddess seems better to me than the other stories and remakes they have done.,1389830400,,271,3.689655172413793
7943690,5,B00005LB8F,"I first watched this a few years ago and liked the way the story went. When I first purchasing anime this was one of the series I was wanting to buy but never was able to find. Having bought this I can say the series was as good as I remembered it was and that the quality of the DVD was good as well. If you're a fan of the franchise, I would definitely get this.",1362787200,,364,3.8026315789473686
7943691,5,B00005LB8F,"Well... I think that this DVD has enough reviews for buyers information. But I want to add a bit of background information about the series of Goddess. The original story is actually from a Japanese Manga named Ah! My Goddess (Ah! Megamisama). This OVA version of DVD is kind of abstract of the whole manga book, introducing only the certain portion of its original. They produced later a movie version of the Goddess series, Ah My Goddess, and also a TV series version of it (Ah My Goddess). So, there are three different versions of, well I can't say it's the same story, but maybe ""converging story"" is the right word. Definitely, the TV version is the longest with 6 volumes of DVDs so far and follows most closely with the original Manga books. This OVA version consist of 5 episodes (3 for volume 1 and 2 for volume 2). First three episodes are more fun and romantic, the latter 2 episodes are somewhat sad but beautiful. I also want to mention the originality of three  Goddesses. Although their in-movie roles has little things to do with the original Nordic myth, they are actually the three goddesses who represent time. Urd for past, Berthandy for present, and Skuld for future. Plus, here in the movie, Urd uses the spirit of fire and thunder, Belldandy air and wind, and Skuld uses the water spirits. Sorry, I was a bit off the track. Anyway, another thing I want to add is the music. People kind of forget it to mention but they are actually quite good. They are basically midi music so that it is rather simple but they are actually sung by the voice actresses who performed the three goddesses. If you figure out which voice is from whom and what they are singing, the songs will make far more interesting to you. Additionally, I have a suggestion that ""NEVER try the commentary track from the English voice crews."" It is given as a plus feature of the DVD but from my expirience it is almost a stink that messes up your previous taste of the Goddess show. Their jokes and comments are really obnoxious.",1149552000,,2019,4.5467032967032965
7943692,5,B00005LB8F,"Volume 2 of OMG begins 8 months after Belldandy came to live with Keichi. The 2 episodes in this DVD are getting more series than Volume 1, putting Keichi and Bellandy's love to the test. Of course, the show has a happy ending. If you pay attention to the details, you can find a hint why Belldandy came to Keichi in the first place. Anyway, it is an excellent romantic comedy and it spans only over two DVDs. By all means, get them and enjoy.",1116892800,,443,4.223529411764706
