8400398,5,B003MGSTFC,"Time for a little Scots-style Halloween fun.

In DOG SOLDIERS (UK/Luxembourg/USA-2002), a squad of soldiers on exercise in the
Highlands are suddenly and inexplicably presented with a real and most deadly enemy:
wolflike beasts that have a voracious appetite for human flesh.

Bullets can't stop these enormously powerful werewolves,
and during a night of indescribable evil, one by one the soldiers meet horrible deaths.",1414108800,3,421,5.5625
