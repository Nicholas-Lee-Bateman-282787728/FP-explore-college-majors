8472518,2,B005GYXN9A,"I only ordered these movies because I was an extra in ""Greyhounds"" and hadn't seen it since it was broadcast on TV back in the 90s when it was made. I am unfamiliar with the other movies and did not watch them. I was very disappointed with the the quality of ""Greyhounds."" It wasn't so much the quality of the copy, the plot or the acting (none of which is great) but it appears that this was some kind of rough director's cut or something. Entire scenes had no sound at all. Some scenes had obvious dialogue changes that had been sloppily edited in with voiceovers. There were scenes that had bizarre writing or notes in the frames. There were scenes that had strange color shifts. Choppy editing is common. It almost appeared to be an old 8mm home movie in places. Very strange--and very distracting, which is disappointing because the movie wasn't too bad. Not good, but not too bad. Oh--I was able to find myself in one fleeting scene. My movie career lasted all of about three seconds. I remember being on the set for over 12 hours on a hot and sunny San Diego day, all for the princely pay of around $100 (and a very nice catered lunch). I also got to see (but not meet) James Coburn and Dennis Weaver--Our Man Flint and Chester, respectively. What a treat, which is more than I can say about this cut of the movie.",1440115200,,1321,4.373983739837398

8472521,3,B005GYXN9A,"I started watching Greyhounds and from what I was able to watch, it looked to be entertaining but then all of a sudden, about 10 minutes into the movie - there were blurry vertical lines, some wide and some narrow - displayed.  You couldn't see the movie.  i ended up pitching it in the trash.",1401926400,,293,4.3090909090909095
8472522,3,B005GYXN9A,"The movie recording is of poor quality, I received it in a new factory sealed package . This is the third DVD of this movie that I have purchased and with the same results, audio is interrupted in several places, black vertical  lines travel across the picture at times, and another movie head tag pops in at one point. I have tried these movies on three different players with the same results, these are obviously faulty recordings and was surprised to see Stephen J Cannell  Productions in the title line",1398297600,,507,4.622222222222222
