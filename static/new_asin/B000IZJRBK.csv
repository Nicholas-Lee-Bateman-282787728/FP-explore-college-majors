2664363,4,B000IZJRBK,"Of course Akshay is good to look at no matter what he is in, but his performance in this movie is outstanding. This movie is worth owning. I especially want to encourage American audiences who don't know anything about Indian cinema to watch Akshay Kumar's Khiladi ""series"".",1384732800,,274,4.851063829787234
2664364,3,B000IZJRBK,"Pretty good movie . Not a bad plot but it's been done before . The stunt where he jumps on to a plain that's taking off; climbs up on the wing while it takes off achieves 1,000 feet; climbs to the stand on the top of the plain and jumps off the plain without a parachute and lands on top of a hot air balloon is in THIS film!!!!!! Holy crap BATMAN. That was incredible.

Movie isn't half bad either. The picture could be better once again we have a DVD-R thing from Amazon. Tad blurry as usual. Same old same old but at least you get two Akshays for the price of one.(He's Still a cutie and very fit). He's playing the part of a Evil guy who takes a job from a multimillionaire. The guy actually thinks he'd make a great son-in-law just based on a few weeks knowing him. After the arrangements are made he is caught owing money to a mob boss right before he marries the eldest daughter. The millionaire calls him out over the association so he murders him to make sure there are no stumbling blocks in route to the ceremony . The eldest daughter would inherit most of the money. Riya The youngest daughter of the house is very young. She witnesses the murder and is so traumatized by this she can't speak . On her wedding night Ritu finds out Dev is evil by overhearing him begging the mafia people for his life while assuring them he will pay and she means nothing to him. He sees her and tries to kill her, she manages to defend herself and he dies during his attempt on her life. All of a sudden she sees him alive again or is it  his twin Anand. He swears that he is Anand and that when he went to see his brother he found a ticket in his own name in his brothers jacket along with a pass port with his name on it , but his brother Devs body was missing . Anand states he will help her but then he must leave to go back to his Outdoor rigging business he runs for campers. He is a  a great guy and had come to see about the wedding his brother mentioned . Is it Anand or Dev..you are left guessing a while...be on the look out for the mob, a dead body and a love story that's not half bad . Enjoy.",1341878400,2,2101,4.021531100478469
