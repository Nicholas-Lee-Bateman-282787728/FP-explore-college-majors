5930996,5,B00EOLRG3K,"Love where the girl found the dog and was able to help him.  Also liked where the vet was able to help the family with the dog.  Very sad at times like when they take the dog from the girl and her family but, a very happy ending when the cop decides to return the dog to the family and move on.  Good family oriented movie.",1384819200,3,323,3.8636363636363638
5930997,3,B00EOLRG3K,M daughter liked it but I was not impressed.  The movie had potential to be a great story but fell short by bad acting and unbelievable characters.,1384819200,,147,4.444444444444445
5930998,1,B00EOLRG3K,"What a total disappointment.  Once you get passed the aging Luke Perry (who looked like he would rather be doing anything else than working on this movie), you had to deal with obviously ""first time"" actors with no talent.  I was so looking forward to watching this one with my grandchildren.....I'm so glad I decided to ""preview"" first.  Best description of this one....""cute story line"" in search of: competent actors / director / production crew.",1383696000,,449,4.96
5930999,5,B00EOLRG3K,A Great family show.  Love that the little girl is able to rescue the dog and get help for him.  Also love it that the cop finally returns Scoot to the family for them to keep for good.  If you love animals this is a must watch show.,1383436800,7,233,3.8125

5931009,5,B00EOLRG3K,"My 7 year old grandson and his 4 year old brother have watched this movie twice and I plan to give them their own copy ! They enjoyed the rescue of Scoot, the bad guys who are robbers, the choir scenes , the paint ball attack to foil the robbers, and the children praying at the vet's office. Good message and family friendly.",1387670400,,326,4.190476190476191
5931010,5,B00EOLRG3K,My daughter is 7yr old and loved this movie and it showed her how to work through conflict between the kids  and showed her how the bad guys had to pay the conquences for what they did. I also loved the fact that all the kids prayed together for the dog when he got hurt! Great family movie !,1386374400,4,292,3.9491525423728815

8607436,4,B00EOLRG3K,"The Stevensons have just moved to the resort town of Heber Valley, Utah, for Paul (Luke Perry) to be the new manager at the local bank and for his two girls to resent the move. It's more about 10-year-old Kassie (Ariana Bagley) than it is about her older sister, 15-year-old Esther (Camrey Bagley Fox). The movie gets more inside Kassie's skin.

Kassie - and, I figure, probably Esther, too - is concerned about going to a strange, new school and fitting in and making friends. She asks her new teacher if the school had a musical program, and is told no. See, Kassie's adored late mom was a very musical person, and Kassie's taken up after her.

Maybe some plot **SPOILERS** now.

One day Kassie walks into a church and observes a shabby children's choir at practice, and it's not going well. She asks the pastor for permission to work with the kids, and, turns out, Kassie is adept at directing a choir. She can sing, too. Which ticks off the choir's then best singer, and you can sense a budding rivalry between the two girls.

Kassie is walking home when she comes across a wounded German Shepherd in the bushes, a clever but, right now, whining in pain Belgian Malinois. She sneaks the dog home, dubs it ""Scoot."" Since you and I were made privy in the film's opening sequence, we know that Scoot is actually Jake, a police dog who got hurt while pursuing two bank robbers.

Two more things to know. One is that Heber Valley is not doing so good this year. It's Christmastime, but there isn't much snow, and, so, the resort's been closed, meaning that tourism is down. This certainly impacts the Toys for Tots drive, if you eyeball that empty glass donation box sitting forlornly in the bank. Two, there's been a rash of bank robberies up and down the state. There's been a sighting of the suspects in the vicinity of Heber Valley.

SCOOT AND KASSIE'S CHRISTMAS ADVENTURE came out a few years ago, in 2013. Come Christmastime, it's on steady play rotation for my niece and nephew as they love this movie to bits. Kids will really like this movie when grown-ups may scoff and roll their eyes. Made on a modest budget and with not much in the way of fanfare, it's still  a fun movie. It's got a whiff of HOME ALONE. As you may suspect, Kassie and Scoot do tangle with the bank robbers, except they're these bumbling crooks, so there's not much in the way of harrowing moments.

To me, though, the comic crime elements are secondary stuff. What kept me glued to the screen is Kassie's arc as pertains to her situation at home and at school and with the childrens' choir at church. Kassie has got a big heart and no end of pluck, and I love how she tries to honor her mom's memory and, as the new kid on the block, how she gracefully handles conflict with the other children.

Not to harsh on Luke Perry's mellow, but I can't help side-eyeing his dad character for not being discerning enough to NOT hire those two knuckleheads as the new security guards at his bank. And when these knuckleheads decide to rob the bank, I question their beelining towards the now stuffed Toy for Tots donation box that contains only small bill denominations. Talk about thinking small. Cue the HOME ALONE shenanigans.

I wonder, are Ariana Bagley and Camrey Bagley Fox related in real life? Ariana, lovely and bright, is the star of the film, and she does well in anchoring things. Camrey Bagley leaves enough of an impression that I wished she were in the story more. I'm just glad she was allowed to participate in the big finish. And, color me sappy, but what I was most interested in were the choir scenes and how that tied in, in heartfelt fashion, with Kassie's love for her mother. ""The World Is Ours"" is a wonderful song, and powerful in its own way, and while I feel they made too big of a production number of it for the big finish, its execution still came with these neat flourishes (the opening section sung in French, the little kids getting their quick solos, Esther's part...). I love the song's lyrics and how the kids sang them:

""We have been given the gift of life,
to blossom like flowers in spring;
we get to choose how to spend each moment,
to love, to laugh, to sing.
We can do anything.""

Maybe I'm a prisoner of the moment. I'm definitely a sucker for Christmas movies. But I found bits of this movie to be really moving, the emotional content outweighing the slapstick and bufoonery. And Ariana Bagley is terrific. And your kids should watch this movie. And, maybe, you, too.",1513468800,,4485,4.503075030750307
