569252,3,6303111602,"For once I wish the producers of this adaptation of ""4.50 From Paddington"" could have been a little more faithful to Christie's story.  Instead, they brought back David Horovitcch to portray the irritating Detective Inspector Slack.  Detective Inspector Dermot Craddock from ""A Murder Is Announced"" was the main investigator from the novel.  They also included David Waller to portray a Chief Inspector Duckham, who was never in the novel.  Instead of following Christie's portrayal of the ""love triangle"" between Lucy Eyelesbarrow, Cedric Crackenthorpe and Bryan Eastley; they decided to settle matters by having Lucy fall in love with the infantile Bryan, and transforming Cedric into an oozing ladies' man who tries to hit on Lucy every chance he can.  The photography, which was never that hot to begin with, seemed to have faded with time.

But despite these flaws, I still managed to somewhat enjoy the story.",1326240000,,915,5.190476190476191
569253,5,6303111602,"Wonderful: Great plot, beautiful scenery, good casting, great who-done-it.  We love Miss Marple movies and this one is tops.  The dialog is super and the contrast of the characters delightful.  The inspector against Miss Marple.  The artist brother against the pilot.  The patriarch against anything that moved.  It is great to have solid entertainment that has virtually no profanity, no nudity, no extreme violence, no politically correct themes (except one) and no special effects.  Plus Miss Marple is the spitting image of my dear, departed Grandmother Dixon, except that my Grandmother's personality was not quite as forceful, but could she cook!",1325808000,,652,5.396039603960396
569254,5,6303111602,"Large, expensive productions of Agatha Christie mysteries never come off properly. American versions always try to expand on the original book, creating ""real"" characters from the basic types that Christie wrote. Unfortunately, the story loses it's charm when this happens. Characters made too real create a more real sense of horror when they are killed off or removed to jail, and the threads of the storyline get twisted and lost amongst the ""real people"".

Christie is at her best when played true to the original story, flat characters and all. Good actors who can work within these strict and frankly boring guidelines are rare, but BBC seems to find them and use them to perfection in this series.

Joan Hickson is a gem. Playing Miss Marple to ramrod-straight-backed understated perfection. The countryside, the manor homes, Miss Marple's own cottage, the tiny hamlet of St. Mary Mead, these are the real stars of the show, described to perfection by Christie and well-represented here on film. Seeing a British upper-cruster purchasing a paper with the headline ""Russia wins Space Race"", then hopping on a steam train for a weekend in the country shows how the world of Miss Marple and her counterparts is quickly slipping away no matter how hard they try and keep it unchanged.

So deliciously British, so perfectly played. Shows like this present a bygone era with such solemn sentiment it gives us a precise window in to how things were, giving us a few hours of wonderful entertainment without making us feel an urge to go back there in person.",1307059200,2,1557,4.935114503816794
569255,5,6303111602,We watched this on line. It was a good plot. Miss Marple is refreshing and fun to watch as she solves mystery after mystery in such a common sense approach.  A good family entertainment film. The plot is believable and the characters are always realistic.,1297814400,,255,4.666666666666667
569256,5,6303111602,"We love all the Miss Marple mysteries. In this one she has a friend coming for a visit. While on the train her friend see a murder, The story has several surprises in it and keeps you guessing up to the end of the movie as to WHO DID IT!",1236643200,2,237,3.76
569257,4,6303111602,This is a good tv film.the actors were good. Miss Marple was very good. This movie had lots of suspence. This is also a cozy film. This is ideal to settle  down with on a winter night. Dont miss this good film in the series.,966297600,15,224,3.977777777777778
7838729,5,6303111602,"This is a great movie based on the book ""What Mrs. McGillicuddy saw."" Elspeth McGillicuddy is taking the 4:50 home to Paddington when she looks out the window at a passing train. She spies a woman being strangled by a man that is hearing trench coat. To distract us just about every man in the movie wears a trench coat.

Notice how Aunt Jane is always several steps ahead of the others in planning. And I like how Aunt Jane grates on David Horovitch as Detective Inspector Slack. ""...When one of us is clever enough to find the body.

See randy John Hallam as Cedric Crackenthorpe playing ""Lord Rhysart"" in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" (1997).",1508112000,,642,4.525862068965517
7838730,5,6303111602,"I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE so MANY TIMES, and it never gets old! Joan Hickson is the BEST Miss Marple I have seen play this part. Would love to own EVERY CD as her playing Miss Marple- perfect role for her.",1399420800,,202,3.951219512195122
7838731,4,6303111602,"I regard Joan Hickson as the definitive screen version of Miss Marple. I've seen this version of the 4:50 from Paddington three times and enjoyed it on each occasion. I prefer to version done in the ""Marple"" series with Geraldine McEwan. Both versions are well done and include a lot of fine acting, but the McEwan version takes too many liberties with the original material is, on the whole, a bit over the top. I certainly enjoyed it, but watching it inspired me to re-visit the Joan Hickson version. I'm glad I did, because a three viewing reaffirmed my feeling that the 1980's series ""got it right.""",1394668800,,603,4.644859813084112
7838732,5,6303111602,"Dame Joan Hickson as Miss Marple is the best! This episode is one of three that I watch whenever I need to settle down, like when I travel and am stuck somewhere or can't sleep. Wonderful scenery and slices of British life in the 1950's. Nemesis has helped me plan my next trip to Great Britain. I love the little bits of irony and dry wit. In this one, Miss Marple is referred to as the ""Old Cockroach"" and the ""Old Crustasean."" I don't know. You may not find this all delightful, but I do. Rich in character acting and dialogue. Some people quote Shakespeare, I quote Austen and Marple. Hmmm, TMI.",1392595200,3,599,4.357142857142857
7838733,1,6303111602,"but, once again, Amazon.com has edited out 5 minutes from the movie. Why, is there such a big time constraint that a movie has to be cut from 1 hr 49 min down to 1h 44m ?  I just watched in on Netflix, have seen this several times, in fact, because I really enjoy Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. This movie is also better than other adaptations of the book, but as is usual per most movies from books, it also strays from it although not as badly as the other movies starring the ""other"" Marples. Two of the scenes cut from this are 1) meeting the cook, and 2) Lucy's cleaning and baking frenzy, both scenes I watched for.

At least it's not as an egregious edit of time as one of the (Rathbone) Sherlock Holmes in which 6% of the entire movie was cut. Annoying and pointless to edit since it's streaming without commercials. When movies we see streaming free on Prime are edited, what on earth would prompt us to want to PAY for them for rent let alone an outright purchase. Why would I want to buy something that's known to have been cut short?",1382227200,5,1043,4.236180904522613
7838734,5,6303111602,"Dame Joan Hickson was the quintessential ""Miss Marple""  I think Mrs. Christie would have been pleased with her portrayal.  While the screenwriters take some liberties with the story, ""4:50 from Paddington"" is a good representation of the original book.  If you want to get as close as possible to the book without reading it, you will like Joan Hickson's portrayal.  She will be missed by all who love Agatha Christie mysteries. Again, my problem with watching came from Amazon's streaming quality.  This is another film what was very difficulty to watch because of the continuous stops and starts.  Very frustrating.",1374364800,,617,5.12
7838735,5,6303111602,"I love these mystery, who done it shows and Miss Marple never disappoints, I can't say I have ever seen one of her shows that I didn't like. I Highly recommend!",1372723200,,160,4.193548387096774
7838736,5,6303111602,"I love Miss Marple and really enjoyed this version of the classic mystery. I also enjoy the actress Joan Hickson's portrayal of the very unlikely sleuth, understated and reserved while showing kindness where it's deserved and cunning in that deceptive way she has of observing and commenting on all the goings on. Nothing truly rattles her and she looks around brightly and suggests we all have a nice cup of tea. So very comforting while being brilliant.",1360454400,,455,4.922077922077922
7838737,5,6303111602,I have watched this over and over since the 1980s and it is one of my favorite Miss Marples with the fabulous Joan Hickson in the title role.,1357430400,2,141,4.071428571428571
7838738,4,6303111602,I have been fond of Miss Marple since I was a kid....would have loved to have her as a great aunt!  I am partial to the Margaret Rutherford portrayal but this actress is good too.,1357344000,,179,4.114285714285714
