7906723,5,B00000F4QD,"This ABT version of Swan Lake has serious flaws, but it is well worth owning for Makarova's exquisitely poetic interpretation of the role of Odette (her Odile is not as strong).  Nagy partners her very well, but is completely overshadowed by her stunning performance, which garners many curtain calls.  The weaknesses?  The corps de ballet is ragged in Acts II and IV and the Gothic decor in Act II does not harmonize with the Renaissance costumes.  Worst of all is the butchered music in Act IV and the casting of a plump, unconvincing non-dancer in the role of Rothbart!  For the possibilities inherent in making this a dancing role, see Marcello Gomes as a far more sinister and sophisticated Rothbart in the ABT's 2005 version of Swan Lake, with Gillian Murphy as Odette/Odile.",1251763200,2,781,4.842105263157895
7906724,5,B00000F4QD,"This is a vhs of the ""Live from Lincoln Center"" presentation with Natalya Makarova and Ivan Nagy. It's the old David Blair production, and it's beautiful in it's simplicity. Nagy was Makarova's best partner, and her performance here is even more stunning & heartfelt than on the Royal Ballet tape with Dowell. Her adagio is unsurpassed to this day, and her portrayal of Odette as a woman trapped in the guise of a swan is so sad, it never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  This has been out of print for eons, so grab it when used copies become available!",1089676800,9,555,4.4411764705882355
