2041335,1,B0001XALV4,"If you wanna sound cool on the guitar get a steve vai instrunction dvd or Bert Weedon.  Avoid this though,  Neo-classical electric just sucks!",1136246400,4,142,4.875
2041336,2,B0001XALV4,"If you want to play like Malmsteen then I can fully recommend this DVD.  Only problem is that this kind of fretwork was all the rage in the Eighties, so anybody listening to you playing like this nowadays (like a lot of the Shrapnel Record copyists) they will probably just fall asleep.",1124841600,3,286,4.5
2041337,3,B0001XALV4,"This video is seamlesly edited with studio footage and a bunch of concert footage as a narrator hypes the living hell out of Yngwie's guitar ""mastery"" (wonder who wrote this?).

The studio parts/lessons are supposed to be ""Master Class"", but I couldn't help but think they were closer to the ""Hyperactive & Attention Deficit Disorder class"" as all the solos and examples blur into the same muddy machinegun-fast lick, repeated (""blues"" at 200 beats per minute?). Yngwie may be a great guitarist, but the smugness and chronic show off get repulsive.

However...it's an overall entertaining video for anyone interested in electric guitar, but don't buy for lessons unless you're a solid intermediate to advanced player.  It doesn't particularly inspire me to pick up my guitar and play (my true test of a excellent instructional video), but I still would've given it 4 stars...if it weren't for the carelessly enthusiastic Yngwie fans/reviews.",1105833600,13,941,5.218543046357616
2041358,3,B0001XALV4,"This is an interesting group of videos that are truly for die hard fans only.  The quality of some of the clips are not very good, reminds me of the recent release of the concert in Korea.  I wish that one was better quality, as Mark Boals is the singer for that concert.

However, if you are a fanatic and long time fan of Yngwie, it is a must for your collection.  Yngwie does do some ""introductions"" which are fun to watch, especially the ""blooper"" segments.

I think it is wonderful that these clips were released, just bear in mind due to the photography and sound, it may not be one to listen to when you have a headache.",1282089600,6,627,4.235294117647059
2041359,1,B0001XALV4,"I'm a big Yngwie fan and have followed all of his work throughout his career with Steeler, Rising Force, and Solo. This DVD is way too amateurish to merit even viewing it. The sound quality is horrible. The video quality couldn't be worse. And I'm not surprised that Yngwie and his wife produced it. Very low quality. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this DVD.",1280448000,5,359,4.714285714285714
2041360,3,B0001XALV4,"THIS DVD IS FOR DIE HARD YNGWIE FANS ONLY. WHILE IT HAS GREAT PERFORMANCES, THE VIDEO AND SOUND QUALITY IS MOSTLY POOR.  THE MUSIC IS OVER TWO HOURS AND HIGHLY COMPRESSED TO FIT ON A STANDARD SINGLE LAYER DVD. IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USING A DUAL LAYER DVD LIKE 99% OF RELEASED DVD'S.",1279843200,3,286,4.296296296296297
2041361,5,B0001XALV4,"This DVD is EXACTLY what it says it is- Raw, and live! Thank you Yngwie and April for putting this together. There's over 2 hours of great concert footage here, recorded from nice vantage points with a decent quality home video camera. The sound is as honest as it gets... straight from the camera; no multitracking or digital enhancemenmts added. So there are some flat notes, and occasional screw-ups, and it is all glorious and great fun. Yngwie introduces a few tunes from his studio and from the front seat of the Red Devil, a nice touch that gives the recording a personal feel, while staying short and to the point. No hokey filler here- 99.9% of the DVD is all about the concerts, as it should be!  Any serious collector of Yngwie material is going to be thrilled with this collection. For me it brings back so many great memories of shows from Malmsteen's first several US tours, and fills in some missing gaps from ones that I missed, too (especially the 1996 footage from the Inspiration tour). It is a testament to Yngwie's inner Fury that his energetic and honest persona lights up the stage so consistently over the 20 plus years encapsulated on this disc. If you are new or curious fan, you probably also want to get Yngwie's Live in Korea (Seoul, 2001) for a more polished performance with multiple professional cameras and high quality soundtrack. The music quality on Raw Live! is compressed and a bit on the harsh side at times, due to the nature of the recordings themselves. But if you are already familiar with the music, and just want to see several different flavors of Yngwie in action over the years, this definitely fills the bill and then some! I'm especially grateful for the inclusion of so many Malmsteen classics and rarities that haven't been in the set list for ages...Sails of Charon, The Fury, Child in Time, No Love Lost, Merlin's Castle, to name a few. Plus we get to hear Jeff Scott Soto singing ""You Don't Remember,I'll Never Forget,""  and Mark Boals singing ""Don't Let it End,""  a fantastic treat as two of Yngwie's most revered vocalists trade places. This will definitely help me pass the time between now and the next CD and tour that Yngwie is working on with Ripper. Six Swords!",1277942400,7,2224,4.6395939086294415
2041362,3,B0001XALV4,"I've been a HUGE fan of Yngwie since the late 80's, but this dvd is really disappointing and not worth the price in my opinion. It is bootleg quality but also lacks bootleg footage that could have been included (Milwaukee Summerfest '85, Legend Valley Ohio '86, 1981 rehearsals, Tokyo '86, Osaka 1992, and many others). Even the new interview footage isn't 2010 quality! I don't understand how officially released VHS gems like Tokyo '85, Leningrad '89, and his Videos collection still remain unavailable in the USA on DVD, but stuff like this gets issued!?!",1276646400,4,558,4.946808510638298

2041364,5,B0001XALV4,"Yngwie Malmsteen is the best guitarist in the world! watch how amazing he plays, no body plays the guitar like that, he is influenced by classic music and he changed the whole idea of guitar playing.",1228521600,2,199,4.555555555555555
2041365,1,B0001XALV4,"Well i popped in this dvd hoping to get some good thorough tips and instruction on some cool speedy neo classical metal riffs. Instead, i see a brief introduction about how amazing and godlike malmsteen (and don't get me wrong, he's and incredible player!!!!) and then he talks little about the riffs he's about to play, then he just shreds away at full speed!! Yes he slows down a little bit, but it's still much too fast to understand exactly what he's playing. He gives no instructions or tips about anything he's playing. Pretty much, it's just him showing off his speed, which if you've heard of malmsteen, you've probably already seen. Good dvds would be Paul Gilbert's Intense Rock DVD, or John Petruccis Rock Discipline DVD.",1218844800,9,732,4.771653543307087
2041366,5,B0001XALV4,"It is with great pleasure that I, Captain McBallsack, conduct the 6th review of the Yngwie Malmsteen Guitar Instuctional Video.  In this video Yngwie instructs me that he can play really fast.  Even when he does a slow version of one of his classic, ball shredding arpeggio sequences, Yngwie is still playing really fast!  I am also instructed that Yngwie has very cool hair.
But by far, the highlight is the ""Blues"" section.  To hear Yngwie play the blues is literally breathtaking.  Surely the likes of Robert Johnson, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and Richie Valens would be rolling over in their graves to hear such a bombasticly splendid addition to the blues lexicon.",1193702400,2,662,4.875
2041367,3,B0001XALV4,"I originally gave this DVD a bad review but after receiving a comment from someone in cyberworld, I figure I had better update my review now that I have five years of playing under my belt.

The DVD is rather fast paced and is basically a collection of fast riffs, Yngwie style.  If you already have chops, and you like Yngvie's Neo-Classical shredding style, then you should be able to learn and assimilate the licks. As a sidenote, there is a section in which Yngie shows some ""bluesy"" licks.

If you were like I was when I first bought it over four years ago, then there will have a steep learning curve. You will have to practice them slowly, and would benefit from a recording device that you could use to record and play the licks back really slowly. That is what I do to learn the faster solos by guys like Yngwie and Matthias Jabs of the Scorpions.

For those that like theory, Yngvie identifies the context in which he plays the licks, for instance identifying the chords he would play the lick over and the keys in which he would play each lick. There are licks using several different scales, such as Harmonic Minor and Diminished. And, as you can guess from listening to Yngwie, he loves scalar solos although he does use arpeggios liberally as well.

A beginner or less experienced guitarist will have to think long term and will need to start very slowly using a metronome or some other timekeeping device, but once the licks brought up to speed, that person will have strong shredding skills.

Everything is subjective, but overall, I see this DVD as a repository of licks which should help you capture Mr. Malmsteen's sound.  I must add that I did buy the book as well, which was of some help.",1186272000,7,1709,4.511326860841424
8017557,5,B0001XALV4,"Lots of insight to his playing!
Yngwie doesn't analyze his own playing too much he is just a natural
He also may not be the greatest teacher
And his version of a slowed down riff is still pretty fast
But this is perfect for getting one close up to break it down
A must for anyone seeking what Yngwie does!",1492214400,2,305,4.1

8017560,1,B0001XALV4,"this is the absolute the worst of the worst quality audio & video! why would Yngwie ""ever"" consider releasing this low quality crappy dvd to the public? i read Relentless & it's an honest memoir that represents what's really happened in his life & career. of course many good humans piss their lives away until they get clean or get a grip on the waste that their lives have become. sounds like Yngwie is having mid-life breakthrough in what will hopefully be the second chapter of his musical & parental/family career~",1429056000,,519,4.714285714285714
8017561,5,B0001XALV4,"Since I own just about everything Yngwie has ever recorded, I had to buy this.  He doesn't really teach much; he mostly just shreds over and over.  Which is just fine with me.",1385769600,,175,4.2727272727272725
8017562,5,B0001XALV4,"For a guy that grew up on alternarock but always envied the shredding masters, I think I've finally found one I can seek to emulate... MALMSTEEN!!!
Granted there's no tabs really (unless you want to buy the book) and Malmsteen appears to only have 2 speeds, lighting fast and fast. Therefore you should expect to do a lot of rewinding and slow mo in order to learn the licks. But all in all the riffs are really cool and for me it's just very inspiring to see some one shredding like this and to know that if I just practice enough I'll get there... Or at least closer. After three days of practicing my speed is already increasing :)
If you like Malmsteen and you're at a respectable guitar level GET THIS DVD, but if you need an in-depth instructional system on shredding DO NOT get this DVD.",1346716800,3,794,4.371621621621622
8017563,5,B0001XALV4,Yngwie in live for the Fire & Ice album with the great Goran i love this singer with inspiraton tour marching out trilogy and the 1981 tour with the genesis tour however!,1334620800,,170,4.34375
8017564,3,B0001XALV4,"I've got to give Yngwie props first off. Ever since he created his own label, Rising Force records, more dvd items have become available to fans than ever before. And we fans appreciate it. Old VHS tapes like Tokyo '85, Live in Leningrad, the YM collection, are probably still owned by his first record label and won't let go. So it may be a while before we see those on dvd.
Raw and Live is clearly bootleg footage that YJM got his hands on and decided to release it. Nothing wrong with that at all. Experience Hendrix LLC has been doing that for years. Nothing re-mixed or remastered, just bare bones footage. Either you will like it or you won't. If you want pro-shot professional quality, I'd probably pass on this one. If, however, officially releasing bootlegs is a trend that YJM continues with, there's TONS of material out there, ranging from exceptional pro-shot quality to not really worth watching. But I do think that this idea is something that fans would enjoy.",1292803200,4,976,4.6473988439306355
8017565,1,B0001XALV4,"Well, amazing to see how could Malmsteen release officialy such a quantity of really raw, REALLY low level video and sound quality videos. The image looks as if you're watching a low quality youtube video/sound,or as if you where watching it using a badly copied VHS tape on a dirty old VHS player, full of stripes, out of collor, with gitter and noise of all kinds, blurry image on ALL THE VIDEOS. Even the one that Malmsteen shortly appear introducing the name of the songs is corrupted by noise. The camera used must be a classic old VHS tape, since most of the footage is around the 90's, and the angle/positioning of the camera if amateur. Bootleg is better than this. I'm a Malsmteen fanatic, afficionado, as they say, but this is a really scam. THE REAL SCAM. I REPEAT: how could Malmsteen release officialy such a quantity of really raw, REALLY low level video and sound quality videos ?
I mean the problem is that it's really bad. Even the menu is horrible. I'm almost sure that Malsmteen called his fanclub or even picked some videos that fans made and sent him, and reunited some (all with BAD quality, must repeat it), and his wife April learned to made a DVD menu on internet, and then sent it to press on DVD. It should cost like $7 dollars maximum, or even better!!!, be given freely at malmsteen website, for example. No wonder that a guitarrist that made amazing albuns, the 4 first, is not only repeating himself musically, but his material is also decadent. From amazing vocalist's like Soto, or Turner, to those lastest, wich can only scream in low and incomodating extra-high pitch. From the amazing 1st album, 2nd, 2rd, to the repetitive scaling, lack of musical ideas, wich appear in his latest albuns. This guy needs to quit with the Ferrari and go back the the same level of geneality and production, and music differenciation, that appears of his first works. In resume, this DVD is a decadent product, in the same level of what's expected of a decadent artist. A shame. I still do not understand a guitarist that has never released materials wich concern his best fase, the early works, do the decadent decision of releasing something like this. My last Malmsteen video. This is SCAM. DON'T BUY IT. This is not even for die hard fans. Such a quantity of good video and audio bootleg around and they release this piece of crap. I sold it. I watched it 2 times and could not do it again because of the really bad quality, even cell phones can record better audio and video. Ego kills. I've learned with Malsmteen that a musician can completely terminate itself musically in the name of ego and not having any more musical ideas, and hiring vocal singers that don't shine more than the guitar, or as the guitar as did Soto and Turner, so his music has truly degradated.",1291766400,3,2793,4.588
8017566,1,B0001XALV4,"The song selection is excellent!! That however is the one bright spot on this DVD. The audio is absolutely horrible and the video is equally bad. The fact that the DVD is named Raw:Live my expectations were low, but this could not even rise to that level. Save your money.",1283040000,3,272,4.46
