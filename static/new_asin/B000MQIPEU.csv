8552671,5,B000MQIPEU,I have to show my age.  When I was little I watched Jabber Jaws on TV.  Now I have a 7 year old step son who just loves sharks.  So naturally I went looking for this show on video.  He absolutely loves it.  He has just about worn the tape out from watching every night before bed and first thing in the morning.  We do not allow him to watch much TV. but Jabber Jaws is a must for him to even go to sleep.  It is just how I remembered it and good clean family fun.  That is hard to find now a day with hidden adult meanings and violence in some cartoons.,1247529600,,554,3.7982456140350878
