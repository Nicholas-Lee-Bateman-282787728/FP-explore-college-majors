As a big science and Astronomy fan, all the Star Trek,s  Independance Days, Armageddons added together don't touch this, not to  mention the future, philosophical commentary by Men from 1960.  The Picture  Quality is 11/10, sound 4.5/5. ""Deep Thoughts""  Gives a whole new  meaning to racism,  why wasn't a flag with the picture of the earth also  erected?

30431,5,0780022319,"While the sequence of events protrayed on film jumps around a bit, I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a space fan.
The DVD is loaded with extra features, astronaut Id (useful when you cannot reconize  who is on the screen), full lenght commentary as an extra audio track, and  more goodies.
The transfer is excellent.  The 5.1 audio is great and the  video is crisp and clean.
I recomment it to you.",951091200,7,411,4.44
30432,5,0780022319,"A superb look back on the entire apollo missions, the extra's bundled with this edition make it an essential purchase if you are apollo daft.  Probably my favorite feature of the disc, is the commentary by Alan Bean as  he discusses his paintings, a nice touch is the subtitles that allows you  to identify the astronauts during the main feature.",950918400,2,346,4.733333333333333
30433,4,0780022319,"I have purchased every decent looking DVD about NASA and the space program that has come out.  Hightlights:  Apollo 13, From the Earth to the Moon.  Lowpoints:  Madacy 5 DVD Set.
Anyway, this DVD gets 1 less than the  maximum 5 stars only because Apollo 13 and From the Earth to the Moon  (FtEttM) are some of the best DVDs out, and this one doesn't quite match  those ones.  The main feature IS good, but somehow seemed a little dry.  What you get is actual NASA video footage with the Astronauts talking over  the top.  The talking sometimes matches what you are seeing and sometimes  doesn't, so it is a little wierd.  Also, it is not a great way of  explaining what you are seeing in the video footage. If you already have  FtEttM, the best explanation is that this DVD is like FtEttM with audio  commentary by the real astronauts.  If you want to know about the Apollo  program, and you don't already have FtEttM, you should get that instead  unless you are obsessed with seeing the ""real"" footage.
To tell  you the truth, as I watched this DVD, I was constantly trying to match up  the real astronauts with the characters in FtEttM.
Here are a couple of  other minor complaints:  It is hard to know who is talking, as the person  talking rarely matches the person shown on the screen.  Maybe you can tell  if you have subtitles turned on, but that would be annoying.  Secondly, the  footage is not in any kind of chronological order, you could be looking at  footage from Apollo 11, then the next face you see is Jim Lovell (Apollo  13) and then you are looking at Ed White doing his space walk on his Gemini  mission.  He wasn't even alive during the Apollo missions to the moon.  I  would have much preferred if they would have lumped all of the pre-Apollo  footage together, Apollo 11 footage together, etc.
HOWEVER, after saying  all of that, there is one feature that totally redeems this DVD.  The Al  Bean photo gallery and commentary are excellent.  You need to watch the  Introduction and then look at all of the pictures to get all of the  commentary.  In case you don't know, Al Bean was the fourth person to walk  on the moon (Apollo 12) and since then has painted many scenes from the  moon landings.  His paintings are fabulous and there is an interesting  story behind each one.  Sorry to mention this *again*, but if you saw From  the Earth to the Moon - you will remember how Al Bean was portrayed in the  episode about Apollo 12.  It is great to find out that he is really like  that and all of the crazy things that he and Pete Conrad did are true.
On  a side note, I checked into buying prints of Al's paintings and they are  available on the web but they are NOT CHEAP - $250 minimum.  He does have a  coffee table book that looks pretty good, but I haven't bought it yet so I  can't say too much about it.  Maybe I will review it when I get my  copy.
Any way, if you are a space nut, you should get this DVD.  However,  if you want to learn about the Apollo space program, this would not be my  first choice (see hints above).  Overall, it is worth the price and I would  recommend it.",950918400,36,3113,4.296875
30434,3,0780022319,"I saw ""For All Mankind"" in its IMAX incarnation at the Smithsonian. I hate to be a party pooper, but it struck me as more a NASA marketing piece than the awesome piece of space trip I had expected.  Admittedly, I am biassed, having seen Spaceborne many years ago. The latter  was a short assembled from public-domain footage, and had a much more  spontaneous, closer-to-the-moment feeling than ""For All Mankind"".  Still, space footage is space footage: hard to screw it up, especially with  a score by Brian Eno.

30447,4,0780022319,"I was somewhat disappointed by this disk. The footage is excellent. But there are some out of context shots. For example, while the story has Apollo flying to the moon they show a onboard shot of a Gemini capsule re-entering. Then they start the story about the failed mission, then suddenly we are back on our way to the moon. As a pilot the most interesting thing for me is the astronauts view of the moon during the approach and landing. I wish I could buy HD video of all the approach/landings, completely uncut, starting with the first view when the camera was started, and ending when the camera ran out of film. We see one long shot of an approach/landing, but it is cut and incomplete. I would also like to see the complete astronauts point of view as each craft leaves the moon from before liftoff to when the film runs out. We see part of one of these shots. Overall I think this disk is worth buying. But I hope for much more. There are some great shots of the astronauts on the moon, and driving on the moon.",1443225600,2,1020,4.317708333333333

FOR ALL MANKIND: Producer/director Reinert raided NASA's massive film vaults and sifted through literally thousands of hours of footage taken during all nine manned missions to the moon, choosing the best shots from each and combining them into a single, seamless composite trip to the moon--the best and most beautiful of all trips.

The result is a vicarious voyage: A distilled description combining visual majesty, otherworldly wonder and quiet excitement. The soundtrack (by Brian Eno) enhances the format of the film, allowing anonymous astronauts to give their descriptions without interruption, enhancement or explanation, accompanying a mesmerizing flow of perfect pictures of the earth, the moon, the ships, and our destiny and eventual destination, the stars.

Reinert obviously understands the phrase ""a sense of wonder""--and no documentary on the space program has ever illustrated the awesome appeal of space travel better than this one. The subtle structure of the film ensures that no distractions come between the ethereality of the actual experience and the viewer's gentle perception of it, leaving us with the visceral impression that we are ourselves on board, experiencing the awe and exhilaration firsthand. ""For All Mankind"" is about as close to ""being there"" as any of us are likely to get--and watching this breathtaking film reminds us what a tragedy that really is.",1422489600,,1652,5.203007518796992
30456,5,0780022319,"This is possibly the best documentary ever made.  It takes you into the heart and soul of the Apollo moon missions.  The footage is unbelievable - the filmmakers combed through all of NASA's footage and found, and in some cases restored, some incredible shots.  You get the feeling that the people at NASA had never looked at any of it with the eye of a filmmaker, and so we are treated to images that were never seen at the time.  The other totally exciting aspect of it is the narration, which was done by interviewing all the astronauts that went on the Apollo missions and asking them things that no-one had ever thought to ask before - like ""what did you dream when you were sleeping on the dark side of the moon.""",1421193600,2,719,4.383458646616542

30462,2,0780022319,"Good material with the interviews, but the flow of the ""story"" and editing presents a misleading recitation of history. You get the impression at the beginning that the story is about Apollo 11, the first moon landing, but it actually starts with Apollo 8 film clips and then continues to interchange clips w/different Apollo missions -- at the director's whim -- w/o informing the viewer, and with the clear intent to treat viewing as one mission, which through close watching -- changes of crew members and equipment -- it clearly is not. Some simple, honest narration could have fixed this, but it's not there.

30476,5,0780022319,"First, you need to know the Apollo Moon Program to enjoy this film, or even understand it. I'm 36 years old, and my earliest recollection of NASA or astronauts was the Shuttle.  My parents both remember Mercury, Gemini, and both watched Armstrong live on July 20, 1969.  It's a radically different experience for those who remember this and knew these men because they were on the news every night, in the newspapers, on every radio station,covered in every magazine.  And with only a few media avenues back then, the Space Race saturated into and blended with American culture.
Second, I was raised by a space junkie.  My Dad raised me with the stories and history of what the science, and this time period, was about.  We visited NASA museums, read the books, went to Cape Kennedy.  He made sure his little girl could name all seven Mercury astronauts AND all ""nine"" planets.  I knew who most of these Apollo astronauts were.

Third, if you're not already steeped in Space Race history, you're probably going to be really confused watching this. The film doesn't announce who you're looking at or what mission is on screen at any given moment.  In addition, the changing voiceover narraration gives no hit as to who's even speaking. Every mission and every astronaut is jumbled up with every other mission, making the movie even more surreal than spacetravel already is.  The whole thing might seem like an ""art film"" about space, which is totally understandable.

Turn on the subtitles.  One track just displays the name/ mission of whoever is on screen.  Another track just displays the spoken text, along with the name of whoever is talking.  Another track shows both together.  If you find the movie very disorienting, turn one of the subtitle tracks and that will definitely help.

I cried watching this the first time. Three years later, I still break down.  It's beautiful and wonderous and will make you feel gobsmacked as to how all this could actually happen.  I've yet to experince another film of such overwhelming awe.

Brian Eno's score was a masterwork then, and still is now.  This is where ""An Ending""--used in ""28 Days Later""--originally came from.  Beautiful stuff.

Pardon me, I need a few more tissues.",1374969600,2,2225,4.846153846153846
30477,5,0780022319,"This originally came out back in 1989, NASA opened their footage vaults for the first time for Al Reinert to create this in '89.  In which they went through thousands of hours of footage, most of which the ""vault keeper"" at NASA had never even seen himself.  I feel like before you graduate High School you should be required to watch this movie, to see how the US was once viewed around the world.  This also is compiled footage from all the Apollo missions, so you can get a view of multiple crews in their own element.  Some of the rare looks at the crew during flight ranges from hilarious to inspiring.  One of the technical sides of this film is the amazing sound quality, especially during the launch sequence.  One little side note about the space footage you will see, like the stage separations in space, are shot on cameras that are shot back to earth in little pods.  These pods have their own little heat shields and then the Navy goes around locating them based on beacon signals.  Another cool thing is you will notice that a lot of the footage in this draws parallels with the movie Apollo 13 and this is because Reinert played a big role in the accuracy of the movie.  I own over 200 Blu-Rays and if my house was on fire, this would be one of the top 10 movies I would grab, if I had a dedicated movie run.  I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in space or even just history in general.  This is footage you won't see anywhere else and I own just about every space history movie from The Earth to The Moon to In the Shadow Of the Moon to When We Left Earth and this still showed me footage I've never seen.  Keep in mind it is not in widescreen though, however I feel like this adds to the authenticity of the film, instead of cropping it to 16x9 just for current TV aspect.

The whole movie is  a mash up of the various Apollo missions and the same with the audio.  This can get a little confusing at times, especially when the audio doesn't match up with the video piece that is showing but its not too bad.
All of the audio is either taken from the ground communications loop or from the astronauts themselves post flight.

I haven't seen the original film, but this restoration looks awesome.
This movie tries to recreate the atmosphere of the places and events preceding Apollo 11 moon landing.
In doing so, the director jumps back and forth in the chronological order, using the best material (I guess) available of each logical step of the launches, sacrificing chronological accuracy but to what I find a very good result.
The original movie does not include the names of the astronauts interviewed , or captions describing what mission the footage was taken from, but you can enable those as they're available as subtitles.
If you are very familiar with the persons or with the exact dates events took place (I'm not that familiar) you might find it a little bit confusing as others have said.
The focus seems to be the human aspect of the missions rather that the technical one.
I enjoyed the philosophical or existential reflections of the interviewees.

This is mostly the raw film, with all its flaws, and you don't always know what you are looking at. Indeed, I spent a good bit of the time while they were on the moon trying to figure where the camera was that was taking the picture. It turns out they have mashed together several trips, and so while there were only two astronauts on the surface in Apollo 8 (or was that 9?), there were more later, and there were cameras on the rover (which trip had the rover and went up to a ridge at a considerable distance from the lander?), and all together this was pretty confusing.

I'm glad that NASA went to such trouble to shoot and preserve this amazing footage from the Apollo missions.  I'm glad that the documentary filmmakers discovered this treasure trove of historical footage in the NASA vaults, and made it available for the entire world to see in this film.  I'm glad that they were able to make copies directly from the priceless original film reels, to insure the best possible picture quality.  I'm glad that they interviewed the Apollo astronauts for this documentary, so that they could tell their own stories in their own words.  I'm glad that this film got made.  And I'm glad that it is now available on DVD and Blu-ray so I can watch it in the comfort of my own home whenever I like.  I'm also glad that the disc comes with a number of interesting special features, including a mini-documentary on the making of the film, a mini-documentary on the artwork of former astronaut Alan Bean, and more interviews with the Apollo astronauts.  The fact that this exists at all is worthy of five stars.

But it's not a perfect film.  It's good -- one might even say great -- but not perfect.  I'm just not happy with some of the creative choices that the filmmakers made.  To be fair, they may not have had all that much of a choice, since they had to make do with the historical footage and interviews available to them.  But I still found it a little annoying.  What, specifically, am I talking about?  Well, instead of treating each Apollo mission separately, or focusing on a single mission such as Apollo 11 or the ill-fated Apollo 13, the filmmakers decided to create a composite picture of all of the Apollo moon missions.  In essence, they painted a portrait of a generic mission to the moon, using footage and audio from several different spaceflights, including some from the Gemini program, edited together as if it were a single lunar mission.  In the course of what appeared to be a single flight, they had a spacewalk in Earth orbit, a catastrophic failure en route to the moon (""Houston, we've had a problem.""), the first manned moon landing, the first human to set foot on the moon (""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""), a fun drive in the lunar rover, and the last astronaut to walk on the moon singing a happy tune as he hopped across the lunar surface (""I was strolling on the moon one day / In the merry, merry month of December ..."").  But these events did not all take place during the same spaceflight.  (In fact, the spacewalk in Earth orbit took place years earlier during the Gemini program.)  So it leaves a somewhat misleading impression.  The filmmakers justify their composite portrait of the Apollo program by claiming that their purpose was to give the viewer a feel of what it was like to go to the moon, rather than giving a detailed account of each of the Apollo missions.  Fair enough.  But it was still misleading.  The filmmakers should have been more explicit about what they were doing, and should have clearly marked each section of footage so the audience could tell which mission it was taken from.  I was almost tempted to give this film a four-star rather than a five-star rating because I was not happy with the artistic license taken by the filmmakers.  But I was so delighted at being able to watch this footage at all that I decided to be charitable and give it five stars.",1332201600,2,3568,4.562009419152276

The special feature of the Astronaut talking about his moon paintings and then the subsequent 37 minute segment of his paintings with artist commentary combine with the movie to make this Blu-ray absolutely worth owning. The movie is great, but combined with this section about the moon paintings, it is out of this world! (Heh).

The artist astronaut returns home from the moon and continues painting what he's always painted until a friend confronts him. He tells him that he is the only artist EVER to go to the moon and he should paint that. The paintings are well done and beautiful to look at.

30501,4,0780022319,"Director Al Reinert came up with a brilliant idea. He took the footage shot by NASA of all the Apollo moon missions and spliced parts of them together in such a way as to create a film documenting what a single mission to the moon was like. This may sound odd but it does work. (NOTE: He does splice in a Gemini space walk for dramatic effect which is simply spectacular to look at).

The voiceover narration (no talking heads) is done by the astronauts themselves but we never know who the astronaut is that is talking and whether than correlates to the astronaut we see on screen let alone the mission. You'd think that would matter. It doesn't.

The only part I found dragged was the footage on the moon. After you've seen one crater or moon walk you pretty much have seen them all.

The extras are really good with now some talking heads interview outtakes with 15 of the astronauts. Other extras are on Astronaut Alan Bean's moon artwork, a collection of classic NASA audio clips (""Houston, the Eagle has landed,"" etc.), a series of video on various NASA rocket launches plus you get a nice glossy booklet with the whole thing.

The quality is truly breathtaking. Having wanted the Criterion region A version since release I was thrilled to see the same version being released in the UK by Masters of Cinema. The film footage has been scanned from the, unfrozen, original NASA film archives with eye-popping clarity. This coupled with the candid interview dialogue track from 20 of the 24 Apollo Astronauts has created a cinematic tour de force.

30504,4,0780022319,"I guess the best point to start this review is with the movie itself. Almost the entire movie is composed of footage that was taken on the Apollo missions to the Moon back in the late 1960s and early 1970s along with footage shot in Mission Control during the missions. Film from all of the missions is edited together to create a sort of experience of what it is like to travel to the Moon and walk on its surface.

On the plus-side, the footage in the film looks great. Most of it that was originally shot on film (i.e. not the television transmissions) has been remastered making the pictures clearer than ever before. All of the footage, whether remastered or not, is a real joy to look at.

However, I was not completely satisfied with how the film was edited. Audio and video is sometimes edited in a completely random mish-mash. For example, during the Lunar orbit insertion burn, both the audio and video is taken from sources not related to the event. Another one comes from the trans-Lunar injection burn where footage from a re-entering Gemini capsule is used. As Reinert himself explains, he said that it looked pretty and he needed something to represent the event. For me, it was such a glaring error, it is hard to simply accept Reinert's explanation. On another note, a title card at the beginning of the film states the Lunar voyages occurred between December 1968 and November 1972, when in reality the last mission (Apollo 17) happened in December 1972. That is a rather poor way to start the movie.

This is not a documentary in the traditional sense. In the movie, you will not hear facts about how engineers were able to construct the Saturn V or how the Lunar Module worked. Emphasis is on the experience of the voyage. The astronauts themselves, who are only heard by voice in the film, are never even identified. Again, this is to emphasize a human voyage with the astronauts essentially representing mankind.

The first major bonus feature is the audio commentary by director Al Reinert and Apollo 10 and Apollo 17 astronaut Gene Cernan. It was pretty fascinating especially hearing from Cernan. He gives some facts about Apollo and what it was like to walk on the Moon, but also gives some of his own views on the space program and why he thinks it is important.

A making of documentary is also included. Reinert explains how he searched through hours of footage and used the best of it to compile the film. Al Bean is also interviewed. It also offers a rare look into NASA's footage vault where the original film is kept under tight storage inside a freezer for preservation.

The next bonus feature features various film of astronauts years later. Some appeared to have been filmed for the DVD while others are taken from press events.

The short movie about Al Bean and his artwork is truly fascinating. After leaving NASA, Bean pursued his interest painting. He shares many of his works depicting scenes from Apollo both realistic and some more fantastical.

The last two features consists of little more than stock audio and footage that are not even worth mentioning.

So, all in all, this DVD was a mixed bundle for me. I would go to say that the bonus features, including the commentary, alone are worth the purchase. The footage in the movie itself is amazing to look at, but the style of editing and storytelling kind of ruined it for me. Is it a bad film? No. Was it great? Not really, either. If you are a space exploration nerd (like me), you will probably not get much from the movie, but this DVD is still worth the purchase. If you are just a casual movie-goer not interested in the science and just want to see some footage of man's exploration of space, then this film will probably appeal to you.",1293840000,,3743,4.608108108108108

30507,3,0780022319,"An aspect of this film that lends it uniqueness, is that it is, in a sense, a pure documentary- just the images and words of those involved. It has no political nor philosophical; agenda. Too much agitprop has infected documentaries of recent years. A Certain Kind Of Death is perhaps the only recent documentary I can think of that trusts its audience to this extent. Susan Korda, the film's editor, also deserves notice. It is truly rare that in any film (fictive or documentary) editing plays such a key role, but this is one, and it is not in the length of the particular scenes and how they are edited, but in which images and scenes are in the film, and what other ones (and words- culled from hours of astronaut interviews) they are juxtaposed with. A really great job, and not a wasted second in the film, right from the opening shot of President John F. Kennedy's tossing down of the gauntlet in a speech at Baylor University to the final shots of the missions in flight. Brian Eno's score is also noteworthy.

  Of course, the only negative thing concerning this film is nothing of its own doing; it is the waste of decades since. Cernan, in the commentary, speaks of sometimes feeling that President Kennedy actually reached into this century, and forcefully willed NASA to the moon decades ahead of time, and I am forced to agree. The tepidity of the public to intellectual and artistic pursuits is only emphasized by witnessing folk, from not too long ago, who treated such ideas as ideals to be cherished and nourished, not dismissed. The moon landing is one of those rare instances where a single act literally changed mankind's view of itself, yet, it did not change enough of it to fundamentally better us all. That fault is society's, not the men and women who achieved this monumental thing. And hats off to Al Reinert for taking up a task even NASA did not feel a need doing, and doing it so well. Simply put, whether a fan of Criterion, documentaries, history, or science, this DVD is one of the few essential films to treasure and explore. If only those political hacks who fund NASA understood exploration and the value of knowledge, perhaps we'd already have had our Martian Apollos and Armstrong.

30509,4,0780022319,"This is a comprehensive review to help you get the most out of this blu ray.  In summary, this movie contains compilation clips (NASA footages) of past Apollo journeys placed in chronologic order resembling a single mission to the moon (and back).  Hence one may even call it, ""the best of"" hand picked, or in CD audio terms, ""greatest hits.""  It's not a science program, nor a documentary, as there is no narration.  However, there are 2 must do's in this film: 1) The commentary on the 2nd audio channel is just as pertinent in this presentation, as both Reinert and astronaut Eugene Cernan speak.  2) For the primary audio, you should turn on the closed captioned since the ""walkie-talkie"" like original staticky transmission sounds preserved may be difficult to discern and at times barely comprehensible.  Also to note, there's a 2nd CC that displays the name of the person talking: very helpful, thank goodness the producers included this.

As far as the video/audio quality, I'm very impressed w/ the blu ray and music (score) 5.1 DTS-HD transfer.  Considering the footage is nearly 4 decades old, and is an improvement from dvd.  Also, since all clips are NASA raw footages (not Hollywood), no make up, it does give a realistic sense you as the audience are part of it, and hence like any successful moon/space program, this film did make me mesmerized.  The main feature is 1.33:1, while most of the extras are widescreen and high def 1080.

As far as the extra bonus material, you get 2 more in this BD than the dvd.  However, the menu for the bonus sound clips were not displayed the same way (not interactive) as the dvd's version (click on the many icons on the moon).  That was my only disappointment.  There's a booklet enclosed, but it's not a big deal.  I flipped thru it only once.

As far as the packaging, this blu ray is cased in a non-conventional clear case; I believe this is the mode of the Criterion collection marketing attempt to be unique, or independent.  Also, the front cover is completely black and white (as opposed to the older original dvd cover).  At first this was a disappointment to me because I thought I was getting sub par recycled bootleg, but don't worry, it's straight from the factory.  It's still a blu ray disc, and high def transfer.

In summary, this is not a Hollywood movie, nor is it a documentary.  These are just raw footage clips and raw sound transmissions, masterfully crafted in chronologic order to display a flavorful 1 mission journey to the moon and back, as it truly is, from NASA.  The multiple audio tracks and CC become o so more important in its enjoyment.

I rate this blu ray 5 stars, but the film 4 stars, for the reason that this is not an ideal stand alone one and only moon program of ownership on your shelf.  But it is a superb, and I recommend as an additional necessary supplemental accompaniment to: In the Shadow of the Moon, HBO's From the Earth to the Moon Signature Series, and Apollo 13 movie.

It takes footage from all the moon missions and edits it together in a composite of the chronological journey of the astronauts, from rocket launch, to traveling through space, to moon landing and back to earth. This approach makes it incredibly engrossing, and makes it feel like a single trip, despite the fact that it's footage from many missions.

What was so surprising about this movie was how emotional it was, from the nerve-wracking shuttle launch to the awe-inspiring images of astronauts working on the ship exterior while traveling over the earth to the deep regret of the astronauts who had to stay behind while their shipmates got to go down to the surface of the moon and explore.

I've shown this movie to about 5 other people, and the reaction is universal. The movie start and people are completely sucked in and awed. And these are people who are not necessarily expecting to be interested in a ""space documentary"".

Instead, we are introduced to a contemplative , soulful and truly insightful gentleman who expresses the universal importance and positively spiritual significance of that entire period of history.  As he states, it was impossible, period. There is no way, in retrospect, that we could have gone from missiles blowing-up on the launch pad in 1960, to putting men in orbit around the moon in 1968. Mankind has never before or since put together such a mind-boggling project, let alone in eight years. What Gene touches on - lightly- is the sacrifices of all those involved. The divorce rate was 80% for the Cape Canaveral area in those days. Ron Howard tried to capture that aspect of the Space Race in the two hour segment, Part 11, ""The Original Wives Club,"" of the HBO movie, ""From The Earth To The Moon.""

The engineers and technicians from that era tell stories that 14 hour days were just common, because no one wanted to leave their job. There was a spirit of teamwork and comradery that has left a hole in their psyche that has never since been filled. As Gene says, ""It's as though we went into the future and stole  a time segment.""

30516,5,0780022319,"""For All Mankind"" is simply a wonderful movie with superbly transferred and restored video and audio straight from the NASA ""Cold Storage Vault"".  The video is incredibly clear and crisp.  The focus of the film is indeed the raw video taken by the astronauts themselves.  This is not a ""technical"" documentary but rather a ""Video Documentary"" with narrative by the astronauts themselves.  The entire movie is actual NASA video.  The extras on the DVD are excellent as well and greatly enhance the movie itself.  Given the many, many deservedly glowing reviews of the film itself, my only (exceedingly minor) complaint is the review in the included booklet from movie critic Terrence Rafferty.  While glowing in his praise for the movie, his reasoning and choice of words are miles off-base.  A movie about Apollo that is ""sensuous"" and ""nearly erotic""?  Really?  His disdain for all things American is evident.  He is surprised (and disappointed?) that the USSR was not first to the moon.  Of the US Flag in some moon scenes, he says ""has no business being there"".  Of US scientists, engineers and astronauts, he calls them ""square"", ""wearing geeky glasses and ill-fitting shirts"", ""mostly with crew-cuts"", ""straight arrows"".  He expresses his ""unfathomable"" shock that a journalist(!) such as Al Reinert would be capable of making such a wonderful film on his first try.  Save yourself the frustration and skip the review.

However, this film with all of it's incredible potential is a big yawn.  Even though his intent was to combine all the missions to tell one story, it is very disjointed.
There is just no flow to this film.  I'm a filmmaker and hate to be critical of films but I am just so disappointed.
  There have been two films made in the last 35 years that do justice to the Apollo missions. In fact they are films that will give you goose bumps and put a lump
 in your throat.  The fist and by far the best is called ""The Greatest Adventure"" produced by NFL Films believe it or not.  They did for the Apollo missions what they
 do for football but even better and Orson Welles did the narration. This film was produced in 1979 and is hard to find but is one of the few films that includes
 Neil Armstrong being interviewed.  It is a MUST SEE!!!!!  The next film would be Ron Howard's ""In the Shadow of the Moon"". This too is an excellent documentary

The presentation may be out of proper historical order of the flights now and then but it isn't a big factor.

I watched moon walks on color tv, live from the moon, back in those days.  I also watched people who wouldn't watch the live tv from the moon at all.  Strange.

This was not a documentary in the strictest sense of the word, as it was a mish-mash of all the missions assembled into a somewhat logical, though inaccurate order.  The overlaid commentary that described the specifics of the technology was 'treated' to blend in with the actual voice transmissions, which I found distracting and misleading.  I think the best way to handle this material would have to been to shift the footage to the left or right and use the remaining screen-space to describe mission number, objectives, crew and other details and any narrative should have been done differently.

30527,5,0780022319,"The title of the MOVIE quotes a plaque left on the moon by the Apollo astronauts, but it also describes what this film does for anyone who watches it.  FOR ALL MANKIND gives us the experience of being an astronaut; what they felt, thought, and saw.  Not with computer graphics, but entirely with real film and video shot by NASA, pulled out of liquid nitrogen deep freeze just for this film.

This film was restored to the highest VIDEO quality ever achieved for these motion pictures and the result is breathtaking!  Footage I've seen before now has awesome life-like quality and is only a small part of this extraordinary collection of footage.  Perhaps the most amazing film ever shot, it is simultaneously real and unreal.  The footage of Kennedy's stirring 1962 speech, that started it all, is an example of how the video quality occasionally varies since it is low quality at the beginning and high quality for his closing remarks.  Each rare instance of grain or blur is probably due to the original media and is overshadowed by the miraculous beauty of the video throughout the film.

The AUDIO consists of interviews with the Apollo astronauts, accompanied by an evocative and skillful ambient soundtrack by Brian Eno (with Daniel Lanois).  The sound effects and sound stage are good, not Ben Burtt quality, but good enough.

EXTRAS. An audio commentary track featuring the director, Al Reinert, and astronaut Eugene Cernan, consists mostly of Cernan's philosophical thoughts about space travel, so don't expect a typical movie commentary.  Cernan was the last man to walk on the moon and an experienced astronaut so it's worth listening to even if it doesn't relate scene by scene to the film.  I would have enjoyed a little more behind the scenes commentary from Reinert, but that is made up for in the ""Making of"" documentary and the collection of astronaut interviews (including some of the rarely seen Neil Armstrong).  The gallery of astronaut Alan Bean's paintings provides unique artistic insight into the experience of living on the moon.  The Criterion delivery and interactivity is excellent, with a beautiful menu, a timeline that allows the viewer to bookmark scenes, and a well executed booklet with stunning photographs, essays, and information on Apollo, the film, and the transfer.

I am grateful that Reinert was able to work with NASA to assemble their uniquely beautiful achievements in one ""best of Apollo"" film.  NASA seems to err on the side of science and engineering, almost forgetting the inspiring sights they could share.  This film is a rewarding experience for anyone that doesn't know about, doesn't understand, or has forgotten the wonder of space-flight and of exploration in general, and what that shows us about the potential of the human race, what we can achieve FOR ALL MANKIND.",1250726400,4,2825,5.002136752136752

30529,3,0780022319,"Containing eighty minutes of amazing footage from Apollo missions to the moon, this newly restored high-definition digital transfer, from producer -director Al Reinert, takes an already amazing product, and makes it look and sound better.  From Criterion Collection, this new release hit shelves on July 14th, and is sure to wow those interested in the footage of trips to the moon.

Reinert has done a remarkable job of gathering often never before seen footage of the adventures of the twenty-four astronauts who travelled to the moon.  Combining said footage with an enchanting sound track by Brian Eno makes for an interesting look at some exciting footage.

Though Reinert may be a fine documentarian, he fails as a storyteller in this outing.  By combining all the footage into a single trip to the moon, he confuses the audience as they try to determine whose voice is being heard, and why the faces continue to change.  Once the film has ended, and some of the bonus material is viewed, you get a better idea of the goal, and the optional on-screen identifications do help, but it is not the combining of footage into one story that is the true tragedy in storytelling here.  The omission of information regarding the return from the moon, re-entry, splash down, and simple questions such as; what is it like when that hatch is opened for the first time back on earth, or what is it like to step foot on earth again?  It's somewhat laughable that in the bonus feature ""An Accidental Gift: The Making of: For All Mankind"" Reinert explains his reasoning for not telling the entire story, as he states that he felt the return was anti-climactic.  Actually, it is the definition of climactic, and completely necessary to this tale.

Other bonus features include: Audio commentary featuring Reinert and Apollo 17 commander Eugene A. Cernan, the last man to set foot on the Moon, On Camera, a collection of excerpted, on-screen interviews with fifteen of the Apollo astronauts, A short piece on astronaut Alan Bean and his artwork, NASA audio highlights and liftoff footage, and A booklet featuring essays by film critic Terrence Rafferty and Reinert.  In many cases the bonus material helps to round out the feature.

There is no question that the footage in this release is spectacular, but combining the footage with the interviews found in the bonus material, and allowing the footage to stand on its own rather than trying to combine it into one trip to the moon, would have made for a better viewing experience.  The addition of the experiences of the astronauts on the return from the moon, are crucial to rounding out this project.

Recommendation:  Great piece of history that makes for an educational and entertaining viewing experience, especially for those too young to remember the events.  Could have and should have been a more complete piece of storytelling.",1249257600,14,2876,4.923395445134576

Mixed bag. Some parts were interesting, others left me wanting to reach for the fast forward on my remote. Specifically:

The Good -- Apollo 11 landing video was amazing, best I've ever seen. Surface operations video was excellent as well, some I'd never seen. DOES benefit from the higher resolution of Blu-Ray in places.

The Bad -- WAY too much time and video of astronauts horsing around for the camera in route to the Moon and talking about their feelings and the ""vastness of space"". Like some type of encounter session or something. I want interviews with engineers, talk about mission planning, details on computing systems, science operations carried out on the lunar surface, etc. None of that was provided. Also -- portions of the NASA video had some sort of grainy, ""artsy"" effect added to it that served no purpose whatsoever and ruined those segments for me.

Of course, when the DVD came out, I had to have that version.  Now, on Blu-Ray I can only imagine that it's going to be incredible.  I saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco years ago.  It was a very different experience watching it on a big screen in a theater filled with people.  Obviously, I was speechless, but sharing it with other people who were just as overwhelmed as I was made it a very moving experience.  Try to share this film with others, especially if you have a large family and/or young kids.
It not a ""rah-rah America"" rally call and it's different than an Imax film (though I'd love to see it in Imax).  It's not ""cheesy"" in the least.  Instead, it calmly immerses  - it puts you in a different mind set.
So, immerse yourself.  It's awesome.
One trivial bit - since Harrison Schmidt was the Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 17, and followed Mission Commander Cernan out on the surface, doesn't that make HIM the last man to set foot upon the moon?  I'm certain the Cernan was the last to re-enter the LM - I remember when he spoke the final words from the surface - but, officially.....ohnevermind.",1248998400,,1247,4.397379912663755

As far as documentaries are concerned, this has got to be one of the best I've seen or can imagine.  The extraordinary thing about it is that they make you feel as if you are involved.

For the most part, it looks modern, as if filmed much more recently that 40 years ago - and it looks wonderful on blu-ray. The later flights are stunning and in vivid color.

The documentary does become a bit confusing because it mixes footage from all of the Apollo flights to talk about the sense of being on the moon more generally. Thus, there is black & white footage from Apollo 11 mixed with color film from Apoll 17. Unfortunately, the beginning of the documentary doesn't make this clear and it can become confusing if you don't realize that you're not just watching one mission. I would warn viewers to make sure that the subtitles are on - the subtitles will indicate the Apollo mission number and speaker when they change, so you can keep track that way.

It is STUNNING; there is no other way to describe 80 minutes of pure perfection.

The film that was brought back from the moon, original film elements, were used in the creation of this documentary to begin with when it was first compiled into an intriguing film some 20 years ago.  With the advent of the new digital remaster, the film looks COMPLETELY different; so much so that my 12 year old daughter thought that the scenes shot on the Rover were special effects!  Imagine her surprise when I told her that was actual moon mission footage, and it was as real and as untouched as if she herself were to take it using a camera.  I don't think she ever grasped that fully.  In any case, the video is INCREDIBLE.

The audio of this wonderful film is provided by the voices of the astronauts and their machinery as well as an ambient soundtrack by Brian Eno.  The music fully immerses you in its wondrous and enveloping score.  The new transfer of the Eno audio soundtrack really cannot be adequately described...it is truly a masterpiece, because it becomes part of the film; it IS the film...it literally feels like part of the missions represented in this documentary.  You are surrounded by these voices and machines and this incredible, incredible score by Eno...and it is truly an experience.

I've had the film on DVD for a number of years and it has always been one of my favorites (these guys were all my heroes growing up in the 60s and 70s and I'm a NASA buff).  With the new Blu Ray presentation, Criterion has pulled out all the stops.  As I watched, I was just shaking my head at just how phenomenal a disc this is; that it could be SO much better than my original DVD copy (which was no slouch either, and I have an upscaling DVD player too that made it look great...but NOTHING like THIS!)

With the 40th Anniversary of our first steps in the playground of the Universe upon us, this Blu Ray makes you realize just how much more there is so see out there and why we need to return to the stars...and how much we need to take care of this fragile world (and each other) as well.

30539,5,0780022319,"This is a re-issue of a previous release by the Criterion Collection but features a brand new transfer of the film, which looks fantastic. All of the previous extra material has been carried over.

There is an audio commentary by filmmaker Al Reinert and astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man to set foot on the Moon. Reinert provides some insight into how the film came together. He went through thousands of hours of footage and managed to put together an 80-minute film. Cernan shares some of his experiences about what it was like to be an astronaut at that time.

New to this edition is ""An Accidental Gift: The Making of For All Mankind,"" a 30-minute retrospective documentary. Reinert always wanted to see this outer space/Moon footage on the big screen and this was the impetus for the film. He got his start as a journalist covering NASA in the early 1980s. Through his contacts he got access to their film archives and found footage that had never been shown. This is an excellent look at how For All Mankind came together.

Also new is ""On Camera,"" a compilation of on-camera interviews Reinert conducted with 15 of the Apollo astronauts. In the film itself only the audio is used and it is nice to put a face to the voice.

""Painting from the Moon"" is an updating of an extra on the original edition. After retiring from NASA, astronaut Alan Bean became a painter and this is a gallery of his work with commentary.

""NASA Audio Highlights"" is a collection of 21 soundbites from the first ten years of the American space program. Some of the most famous words have spoken during this time, including Neil Armstrong's immortal words.

Finally, there is ""3, 2, 1 . . . Blast Off!"" a collection of launch footage of various rockets taking off for outer space.",1246233600,47,1767,4.6293929712460065
30540,5,0780022319,"When I first saw this movie back in 1989 (?), the stunning part was seeing film footage from Apollo for the first time. The film was printed from the originals in the archives, with a machine constructed there for that purpose, as I understand it. This was the first time we saw film, not video, from space, and it was stunning.

Now having watched the DVD today, the film-in-space aspect is less startling. But what I found compelling now was the footage of the engineers in Houston watching the first steps on the moon. The astonishing moment in history is written on their faces, which have expressions almost as blank and childlike as the faces of the characters seeing aliens for the first time at the end of Spielberg's Close Encounters.

During the Apollo flights (1968 - 1972), we all felt part of the space age. When this documentary was released in 1989, Apollo still felt like it was just yesterday. Now in 2009, with Eno's ethereal music in the background, a feeling of the surreal overtakes me as I look back half a lifetime ago.

Buy this documentary for the interviews as well as the expected accompanying NASA pictures and movies - you won't be disappointed. It complements other more recent offerings, such as ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" and ""The Wonder of It All"".

30543,5,0780022319,"This is a great piece of work in that it trancends the usual limitations of the documentary format. Rather than a dry linear presentation of the facts, we are given the images and the words of the participants. What is created is the impression of the greatness of the achievement. This is a work that leaves the viewer understanding why this was important in a way that none of the documentaries before or after have been able to achieve.

People obsessed with the details of history will not like it. The director plays fast and loose with chronology and often selects clips to make a point rather than present linear history. But in my opinion, the work proves that telling a story results in a much better work than following the modern obsession with ""recreating history"".

The director lets the men who were there tell their own story in their own words. And that story is all the more effective because these are real people rather than celebrities doing voiceovers.

There is no better telling of the story of the space program leading up to the moon landings than this film. Its a shame so few people have seen it or even know about it.",1205452800,,1145,4.575609756097561

I've watched it about 5 times and it still leaves me in awe each time.  I remember when it happened and as I've grown older and realized how spectacular an achievement this was.  This does more to capture the true goals and accomplishments of man in space.
Why did we climb the mountain? because it was there.  And wow what a spectacular view.
For parts of it you could feel that little tinge of anguish those astronauts felt that just made that voyage and came back without landing.  Seeing those views of how close they were and how far they were from home.

30545,5,0780022319,"The Apollo Missions of the late 1960's and early 1970's were perhaps the greatest achievement in the history of humanity.  Yet the real achievement and meaning has been lost on many of us. Here, in the film For All Mankind, is a chance to bring some meaning and depth to Apollo. Needless to say, it is the perhaps the most effective film on the history of space exploration.

One must give the film's director, Al Reinert, at a ton of credit for his work. Who else could have come up with the brilliant notion behind this film? Who would have thought of taking footage from all of the Apollo missions (and a couple of the Gemini missions) and combining them with the words of the men who went where no one had (or has since) gone before? (Apologies for paraphrasing Star Trek) The genius of this film is that it shuns away from traditional documentary styling. Instead of compiling facts on one mission and having a well known actor/actress do the narration, the film lets those who went tell the story. Who else is better qualified? They might not be professional actors, but the astronauts don't need to be. It is the power of the events they describe that is the main reason for their presence. They are a powerful voice in this story.

In many reviews I have read, I have seen complaints about the mixing of footage or the use of footage out of its context (a Gemini reentry used for the TLI burn for example). Yes the mixing is nowhere near subtle and is, thus, blatantly obvious. But it is my feeling that this mixing was necessary. The only way to get across the story of Apollo's achievement to the average person was to mix the footage. Does it really matter in the end? I mean by that this: the film isn't about a single mission to the Moon. No, the power of Apollo lies not in each mission, but in the overall effect of the Apollo program. This film is about the journey of Apollo, the effect in had on the astronauts, and the effect it had on us all.

If there is one element of this film that really stayed with men it was the music. It is among the most beautiful and haunting things you will ever here. Brian Eno does a marvelous job of conveying the mystery and majesty of both space and the Moon. This is one of those scores who really have to hear to believe.

This DVD is first rate and should be for a film of this caliber. The film gets a 5.1 surround sound mix which is amazing, especially for the lift-off and Moon walking sequences. There is also an excellent audio commentary done by Reinert and Apollo 10/17 astronaut Gene Cernan. Part making-of commentary and part interview with Cernan, the commentary is an amazing supplement to the film itself. There is also a showcase of Al Bean's paintings on Apollo, footage of launches from the first fifteen years of NASA, and a selection of important audio clips from Al Shepherd's first Mercury flight to Cernan's final steps on the Moon. Criterion set out not just to present and preserve films, but to give first rate supplementary material as well and in this case at least they have succeeded.

For All Mankind, perhaps better then anything else out there, demonstrates the power of humanity in space. For one to really appreciate this film it needs to be seen on a large screen in surround sound. Only then can one appreciate both the film and the power of the Apollo legacy. This is the first film I've seen that I recommend to everyone. This is a film that is truly ""For All Mankind"".",1200528000,2,3462,4.452681388012619

But I think if you take this DVD as more of a visual representation of the experience of exploring space and the moon then it is very good. It was very different from what I expected. having been a fan of the Eno record for almost 20 years, I expected it to be more contemplative. It starts out with JFK declaring that we are going to the moon and then proceeds to follow all the seps from preparation of the astronauts to the voyage and finally to langing on the moon and finally return to Earth. There are constant comments by the astronauts regarding space travel and their conversations with the control center. This I agree gives sometimes the false impression that we are watching a documentary.

30551,5,0780022319,"First, much of the criticism from others seems warranted, but after watching this DVD for the second time a couple of years later, it has redeemed itself to receive a well deserved 5 stars.

My mistake on the first go around was not to watch it played with the audio commentary enabled, nor taking the extra time to go through all of the special features provided.  IMO, this will make a big difference to the overall enjoyment and appreciation of this video.

""For All Mankind"" is so much more than just a historical or educational documentary.  It greatly transcends the boredom that once reduced network television coverage at the time to almost a public nuissance during latter Apollo flights.

In the course of just 79 minutes, FAM will dazzle you with the best of the best in-flight coverage and lunar excursions of ALL those combined space fights; nothing remotely mundane by mature audience standards.

As I have emphasized already criticism of this movie will be largely mitigated while watching it with the Audio Commentary turned on.  Filmmaker, Al Reinert and veteran of three space flights, Gemini 12, and Apollo 10 and 17, Astronaut Eugene Cernan, do an excellent job of narration.  They explain in detail several pertinent aspects that go ""behind the scenes"" depicted in the movie.

As he does so aptly in his book, ""The Last Man To Walk On The Moon"", (as Commander of Apollo 17), retired NASA Astronaut Cernan articulates quite humanistically many aspects of Apollo, and what it ""felt"" like to be a participant and vital contributor to manned spaceflight.

Also, of special merit on the special features is still another Apollo Astronaut's perspectives, no less than the 4th man to walk on the Moon (Apollo 12's Lunar Module Pilot), Alan Bean's ""Paintings from the Moon"".  This segment was well worth the lofty price of this DVD alone, and greatly enhancing the viewer appreciation of these long ago historic flights to the Moon.  The paintings depict actual Moon landing events and the astronauts themselves captured in the moment.  There are a couple of dozen paintings and all are first rate renderings by a rather talented artist, who was fortunate to make one of these most successful and historic Moon voyages himself.

Anyone who enjoyed Tom Hank's ""From the Earth to the Moon"" HBO  miniseries will relish this DVD of the same historical period Apollo Moon missions.  The difference is this DVD provides a stark reality taken from the actual 16mm cameras to document the missions as shot by the Astronauts themselves, now captured on DVD in almost pristine clarity.  FAM's Director Al Reinert had direct access to NASA's - nitrogen preseved - Apollo film archive and that level of reproduction quality clearly shows in this DVD.

30552,4,0780022319,"I agree with the space nerds yelling ""Sananaigans!"" over the footage from different missions being put in here to look like it was all from Apollo VIII.  It kind of makes you feel ripped off.  Example:  The space walk footage was actually from the Apollo 9 mission!...or so i've read.

Also as a person who knows very little about the space program I was disappointed in the lack of fact giving narration.  The footage is breathtaking and I learned a lot, but I wanted more information and I wish they had put up a disclaimer telling when there were images not from the Apollo VIII mission.

Worth watching preferably on a large high definition television.",1132531200,9,656,4.660869565217391
30553,4,0780022319,"There is little here that I can add to my review of this DVD, other than to say that other reviewer's are correct in saying this film is best viewed as an impressionistic portrait of what it was like to travel to the moon. If that is what you're looking for, no other film will fit the bill better than ""For All Mankind.""

However, I am still firmly in the camp that says this film could have been made much more interesting with better attention to a more factual represenation of what happened. As such, I suggest that ""For All Mankind"" be viewed as a companion piece to the PBS/Nova documentary ""To The Moon."" While ""To the Moon"" is a more facts-orientated program, general audiences will have no problem understanding the details and will actually come away with a MUCH greater appreciation for the accomplishment of landing a man on the moon. And it represents a much more accurate history of the Apollo program which, ultimately, makes it more interesting. ""To the Moon"" gave me a lot more goosebumps than ""For All Mankind"" did...just because Nova took the time to explain why certain phases of the missions were particularly dangerous or difficult. When Armstrong and Aldrin land on the moon with only 15 seconds of fuel to spare, it really is exciting to know just how close they came to disaster. No matter how many times I watch that landing sequence in ""To the Moon,"" I still get tense during the last minute when they are close to landing. In contrast, it doesn't even warrant a mention in ""For All Mankind.""

Another nitpick that others haven't yet mentioned about ""For All Mankind:""

The ""TLI footage"" where we supposedly see the rocket ignite to propel the spacecraft away from the earth is really re-entry footage from the unmanned Gemini 2 mission! The producers must have figured that ""hey, it looks good, so we'll use it"" even if it had nothing to do with a TLI (trans lunar injection) burn.

This is in addition to the numerous inaccuracies that others have mentioned, including the Apollo 13 portrayal (with Apollo 12 audio spliced in to represent the ""fix"" to the problem), the use of Aldrin's ""jump"" from the ladder to represent Armstrong's ""first step"" on the moon, the wrong subtitles used for some astronauts (look at the mission patches, people!), the White spacewalk sequence from Gemini 4, etc. While most people will view these as ""nitpicks"" they are simple errors and misrepresentations that could have easily been rectified or, in the case of the Apollo 13 section, best omitted (especially if it couldn't be given proper time or treatment). Correcting these mistakes would have taken nothing away from the beauty and majesty of the footage presented here.

So while this is a great film to present a visual feast for the eyes, be wary of accepting what you see as a true representation of what happened. You'll need to view other films to gain that understanding.",1118620800,13,2896,4.749502982107356
30554,1,0780022319,"...read the reviews with interest - but frankly I was gutted to discover that Criterion have 'mutilated' this superb doc by messing with the original score/arrangements.
'Deep blue Day' by Brian Eno and intermittant musical inserts lasting only a view seconds (which previously transported the viewer away from the immediate scene with the Astronauts) have all been removed - the magic has been squeezed out of this classic piece of video/doc architecture by a company who have done the equivalent of a painting a moustache on a classic oil with a black felt tip pin!

30555,5,0780022319,"What makes this a unique addition to the collection of the ""space junkie"" is that it is a nostalgic look at the Apollo space program.  If you are looking for a documentary full of facts, then buy Nova's ""To the Moon"" or the Discovery Channel's ""Blast Off.""  Deke Slayton's ""Moonshot"" is also another good documentary on the early space program.
What makes this unique is that it allows the knowledgable/obsessed Apollo fan the opportunity to look at these early images of Apollo (and Gemini) footage from the perspective of an artist.  Though the film of Ed White's EVA has come under scrutiny due to the fact that it was before Apollo, yet the footage has been enhanced so that it looks sharper and clearer than the original.  The footage that has been pieced together contains images that are obscure and commentary that is rare and personal, reflecting the personalities of the men who made these remarkable voyages.  It is truly a delight to hear of Pete Conrad's explanation of why he made his ""historic"" first words when he became the third man on the moon, or to hear Charlie Duke sharing his dream that he had while on the lunar surface.
Al Reinhardt is a dramatic director, not a documentary director and this is evident in this work.  Apollo buffs are probably aware that he directed two episodes for the HBO miniseries, ""From the Earth to the Moon,"" depicting the Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 missions.  I believe that this is a must see series for the space enthusiast as well, for this miniseries depicts the Apollo program at its worst and best, the men and women who made it happen and does so in the best movie traditions.
For All Mankind is a movie event that does what the astronauts had such a difficult time expressing: by watching these men in flight and on the moon, one can get a better experience of what it felt like to go to the moon.  Unfortunately, these men were scientists, test pilots and engineers.  They were not poets or dreamers, they were the doers of our world and these modern day ""Renaissance Men"" were not able to share the emotion that many of us would have experienced in their boots.  I tip my helmet to Al Reinhardt for giving us a glimpse of what it felt like to go there.",1075680000,12,2211,4.532663316582915

Very pretty pictures, potentially an amazing set of stories, reduced to ""wow, would you look at that"" cliches.
This DVD is a melange of clips from Apollo VIII onwards, strung together as though it were all one disjointed mission.  The footage itself is of course incredibly beautiful but there is a paucity of intellectual content.  Very little information, less explanation of history and context, and ultimately it's junk food for the mind.
With the footage available a really interesting and profound video could have been assembled.  But until the revolution we'll just have to get along with this ""turn off your brain and open your mouth"" prettiness.",1068768000,7,919,5.019736842105263
30557,3,0780022319,"This DVD is nearly twice as expensive as the outstanding ""Nova-To The Moon"" DVD, yet it falls far short of what a true documentary should be. My main complaint is the liberty Producer/Director Al Reinert takes editing video and especially audio into single sequences when they clearly come from multiple sources. The effect is jarring and unpleasant, in direct contrast to the new age musical noodling of Brian Eno.
Yes, the cinematography is great, but it is certainly no better than other commonly available documentaries, as it is after all almost 100 percent 30 year old NASA footage, which is largely common to all the available documentaries.
I do grasp the concept of artistic license, but my issue here is that Reinert takes license when there is nothing to be gained. The most obnoxious single moment for me is the Apollo 13 'Houston, We've had a problem..."" audio, which has added sound effects not found in the original (common through the film) and edits bits of the Apollo 13 dialogue together with the Apollo 12 lightning strike problems during launch, which in his mind, I suppose added drama, but in my mind distorts the truth and fails to tell the story of either of the two emergencies well. When unnecessary compilation and editing like this continues through the film it makes for a very muddled, less factual, film that the materiel deserves.
Some reviewers have praised the film for conveying the 'feeling' of going to the moon well. I don't really dispute that, I just think that a documentary can be factually accurate and have information accurately presented (like in the Nova special) and still be captivating. In fact I think it would be more captivating.
The DVD does have some strong points, that are unique though. One that is useful is the ability to turn on subtitles of astronaut names and selected flight controller names (although mistakes are made here too, they are generally minor). My favorite feature of the DVD by far is a section in which Al Bean (Apollo 12) describes and explains many of his Apollo paintings, which is absolutely fascinating. This alone gave the review three stars.
Overall, there are many better choices of Apollo documentaries available, especially considering the outlandish cost of the DVD. Many critics liked this film. I guess all that means is that many critics prefer a stylized, or 'Hollywood,' form of documentary.",1064707200,13,2386,4.937810945273632
30558,5,0780022319,"I usually don't read other reviews when giving my own but decided to thumb through to make certain that I had not reviewed this before. But I noticed that people are dropping stars because they demand that the DVD be placed in chronological order. Or they insist that it not be a mixture of astronauts. Or they criticize the use of astronauts' voices or that they don't know who said what and babble on and on. The critics miss the point, which director Al Reinert addresses in the director's comments. Reinert's decision to mix and merge all the first generation astronaut came by his desire to use only the best footage of all of NASA's film archives. The only way to present them effectively is the way Reinert did, which made better sense than trying to place the footage in chronological order.
Reinert also wanted to use a generic approach instead of muddling everything up with astronaut identifications (which is actually an option in the subtitles) that might have turned 79 minutes of enjoyment into a technical approach that takes away from the FEELING of the race to the Moon. And all the astronauts, Reinert said, had no problem with that decision. There are enough documentaries and docudramas out there. In my opinion, the intent of this film was simply to place the majority of the world into the cockpit or LEM, buckle that seatbelt and enjoy the ride, since 99.99% or more of us don't have the opportunity to even ride supersonic, let alone even fly into space or even experience zero gravity.
The joy in watching FAM was in how Reinert simply found a way to let us feel the anticipation and drama of preparing for these trips ""and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard,"" as President John F. Kennedy says in his Rice University speech. The quotes that Reinert lifted from the speech empowered the rest of the movie, that Reinert combined the different missions to create a display of a generic preparation- to- splashdown film.
It's such a long journey from Earth orbit to the lunar surface, and in that time, there's so much time to wait. In the way Reinert edited his movie (note that he NEVER said it's a documentary), he did a wonderful job of showing the down time that an astronaut had during that journey. Pop on the optional track where Reinert and astronaut Gene Cernan discuss the projects (the movie and Moon race project) to an even finer detail to get the most out of this DVD.
The package deserves 5 stars in my opinion. There was nothing that I didn't like, except that it wasn't longer. I first knew of FAM while surfing local channels and saw this great piece with a fresh musical track accompanying it. I taped what I could and held on to the hopes of this appearing in a digital format. What also sold me was the musical score by Brian Eno. He has a way of making music sound timeless, and the score he created still sounds just as fresh.
The folks at Criterion did a marvelous job to deliver a great DVD package (details below), and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again.
For those who harp about not knowing who is talking or who is being shown in the movie, the DVD has options to see who is speaking through the subtitles. Another set of subtitles is presented as an option to view simply who is on the screen at the time. I did not get this to view manned space exploration in chronological order (you can get this by viewing the Spacecraft Films series of Apollo, Gemini and the Saturns which have none of the excitement and human interest that FAM does). I just wanted a fresh view of the journey to the Moon, and Reinert delivered exceptionally well, in my opinion.
Technical details: 79 minutes in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1; digital transfer from a 35mm print from original NASA stock footage; original mono track was digitally prepared and output as Dolby Digital 5.1 stereo; optional audio commentary by Reinert and Gene Cernan, Apollo 17 commander; paintings with audio commentary by Apollo/ Skylab astronaut and artist Alan Bean; liftoff audio and film footage from NASA; English subtitles with astronaut identifications; onscreen identifications of President Kennedy, astronauts and key NASA mission control specialists; DVD box says this is an RSDL dual- layer edition, also; 3- page, C- folding pamphlet with Apollo astronaut IDs, production credits and foreword by Reinert.
PS- One piece of stock footage that is recognizable is during staging when one of the rocket's rings is ejected. You know it, the ring floats off with flames inside it? It's incredible to see what the camera inside the ring shows, and Reinert describes in his comments how the footage is actually shot and recovered.",1062720000,4,4707,4.720534629404617

And since most of us will not ever get the chance to set foot on another planet we can only imagine what an extraordinary adventure going into space and visiting the moon could feel like.
  This film captures through its imagery and ethereal music and the conveyed feeling of these Astronauts thoughts of what it could be like for the rest of us had we been there.  It gives us a third person perspective of being on the moon.  The viewer is the camera, not just watching the spectacle of what Astronauts do in space but standing there beside them on the moon.  Feeling what they felt, experiencing what they experienced.
  After watching this I came away with the since that I had been there and had at least glimpsed a tiny bit of the emotional experience that those few men must have been consumed by.

This film gives a tourist's eye view of a trip to the moon.  One astronaut comments that, when riding up the elevator to the launch pad, he realized just how complicated the ship was and how little he knew about what made it go up.  These men were not scientists, they were adventurers.  They had fun in space, and had a difficult time paying attention to their duties while in weightlessness.  There was a connection made as you hear their jokes, and listen to their insights.  It was really nice to see the humanity behind the names.  Through their home movies, I feel like I went along.

Also, being a long-time US Space Program enthusiast, and also having personally witnessed the liftoff of Apollo 11 when I was 5 years old, I was especially interested in the film's topic.
My first impression that night was typical for many Apollo enthusiasts; I thought ""Hey, he (Reinert) jumbled the missions and voice-overs into a confusing montage!""  I walked away unimpressed, but entertained.
About a year later, I saw the film again at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center theater in San Diego.  This time, the film really hit the mark for me.  I was overwhelmed by the mood & awe the film created.  Alas, I ""got it"".  And therein lies the beauty and secret genius to this film; it ""gets it"" too!  It understands that it doesn't matter which Apollo astronaut or moonwalker is talking, or which mission is being depicted.  It only matters that we planted 6 flags and sent 24 men to the moon (12 on the moon); their experience is common, their voice one.  Reinert recognized this, and it is this distinction that allows For All Mankind to transcend mediocrity and become the great film that it is.
For many viewers, the film's subtlety & hissy voice over (which gives the voice over an engrossing, coffee table conversation quality) are likely to disguise its cleverness.  And there is a lot of cleverness and genuinely good filmmaking in For All Mankind.  I was especially impressed with the editing.  Around the 1:02 hr mark there is a slow lunar pan with voice over (Apollo 17's Gene Cernan) commenting on how ""you just had to steal the time to stop chiseling at a rock and contemplate where you were... and then suddenly you had to go back to work again"".  The slow pan ends on a moonwalker hammering a core sample into the surface.  As a film school grad and filmmaker, I must say; nice editing!  Simple and very effective.
Lesser documentaries on Apollo may offer you the technical aspects of this amazing feet.  And few would dare to let a long, slow lunar pan play out uncut.  But only For All Mankind gives you the human aspect of Apollo.  Sure, it comes as the expense of some technical accuracy.  But by emphasizing the human aspects of Apollo the film preserves the most important truths.  And to very liberally paraphrase Arthur C. Clarke, hundreds of years from now that is all that need be remembered, because that is all that really matters.
Today when watching the film I delight in telling people which mission footage they are seeing, who's talking, etc.  (And I still cringe when I see the old standard of using the shot of Buzz Aldrin descending the ladder to the moon over Neil Armstrong's famous first words - yes, that's Buzz, not Neil.  I've checked it against the uncut Apollo 11 TV footage.  The bright spot you see reflecting through the LEM handing gear just to the left of Buzz is Neil already standing on the surface, taking photos of Buzz descending ladder.  The shot of Neil descending the ladder didn't turn out very clear.  Very few people, save for Ron Howard in Apollo 13, use it when depicting the first step on the moon)  But these once important details have, for me, long since become trivial in light of For All Mankind's artistic accomplishments.
I didn't know it when I first saw it in 1989, but For All Mankind is the film I'd been waiting for ever since watching the moon missions live.  (and, yes, Leonard Maltin, it WAS in fact filmed on location)

30566,4,0780022319,"Al Reinert's ""For All Mankind"" uses exclusively NASA footage and the voices of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronauts to tell a story.  It is the story of a vast enterprise, a grand adventure, a national trimuph.  This motion picture is by no means technically accurate, chronologically correct or told within a proper historical timeline.
But all that misses the point of this picture.  What Reinert does in 79 minutes is tell a tale of granduer.  He weaves a tapestry of vision and imagination.  He paints a picture of emotion, triumph, tragedy and day to day grind.  This motion picture was never intended to be a science class.  It is intended to be a documentary that showcases the feelings and impressions of the very men that made the journey.  It is intended to convey a sense of the mad dash to a seemingly impossible goal that this nation was going through in the 60's and early 70's.  If you're interested in a technically accurate chronology of the early space program, then you'd be wise to get a different movie.  But get this one too - if for no other reason than its inspirational value.
The Criterion DVD also contains a wonderful selection of Allan Bean's paintings with commentary from the artist about each one.  Bean's paintings are magnificent and his descriptions of how each one came to be bring a new life to them.

30567,5,0780022319,"'For All Mankind' documents the Apollo space program and the attempt to land a person on the moon as a result of President Kennedy's historic commission.
In some sense, this endeavor was initiated to show the capability of American technological prowess as a justification of our national way of life, but also as a kind of national symbol of scientific excellence  for the first world.
It is a sobering exercise to compare this film, which makes the positive case with the Philip Glass, Godfrey Reggio film 'Koyaanisqatsi', which makes the negative one.
'Koyaanisqatsi' uses a space launch/crash in it's opening/closing sequences as a symbol of the ""madness"" of a country basing it's moral and social growth on the way of technology.
'For All Mankind', for it's part, not only: A) Documents the special collaboration of the mission control crew. B) Shows a powerful and complex vehicle system making an impossible journey C) Features the profound meditations and humor of a variety of heroic astronauts ...but it also has a beautiful atmospheric score by the electronic musician Brian Eno and shows valuable film footage from taken from the rare perspective of outer space.

This movie starts you out at at pre-launch,  taking you through an amazing launch sequence, into orbit, off to the moon,  around the moon and on it and then back to earth.
Other than the visuals  and the amazing Brien Eno soundtrack, what I like most are the commentaries  by the astronauts.  Listening to them, you understand that they realized  the magnificence and importance of their journey.

Even Charlie Duke uses the Apollo 17 lunar  lift off for his  Apollo 16 moonwalker tape. al reinert also wanted to capture the sensation  of spacewalking .

30574,5,0780022319,"As a serious student of the Apollo program, this is my favorite documentary of the program, despite its contextual fabrications and errors.  The  conceit is to represent a voyage to the lunar surface and back as a  composite drawn from footage taken from all Apollo (and even some Gemini!)  missions.  As such it is in some sense a fictionalized account to begin  with, thus one must look beyond this film as a simple and literal  documentary, if you are willing to accept its premise.  To me it succeeds  at a psychological and emotional level as the film that best captures the  spirit of the Apollo program, and even better, what it must have been like  to have actually gone to the moon.
The footage is fantastic and rarely  seen, even in real documentaries about Apollo.  The pace at many points  slows, and you are invited to dwell on the scenes, and perhaps even picture  yourself there with the astronauts.  A particular treat is that the movie  is heavy on footage from the final mission involving the lunar rover, where  the real exploration took place.  These missions are often woefully  represented, but here you get a sense of what it must have been like to  have diven miles from the LM, exploring the lunar surface in complete  solitude; or in other parts of the movie to have orbited alone in the CSM.  Other treats are candid footage of the controllers in Houston, as well as  dramatic usage of JFK's speach on Apollo given at Rice university in 1962.  I will admit that the film doesn't state the true context of any of its  footage, and a good portion of my enjoyment is being able to sort this out  for myself; however, more than anything this program reminds me of what it  was like to grow up and go to the moon with Apollo.",956102400,71,1747,4.512820512820513

Much is shockingly out of order or just plain wrong.

I was able to enjoy this  film for other merits. Al Bean's paintings and commentary were beautifully  done, and I had not seen much of the footage. I was particularly struck by  long sequences in which we third stage ignite and the Earth rush away, the  disappearing descent stage as the ascent stage takes off, and the LM  approaching the orbiting CM.

The scenes are spell-binding as ships manuever in the  cold blackness of space, eventually landing on the surface of the Moon.  The feature follows the sequence of an Apollo mission from the astronauts'  dressing rooms, through the launch of the mighty Saturn V rocket and  traveling through space, climaxing with views on the Moon's surface. Scenes  are inter-mixed with footage from different Apollo missions, but it's not  that displeasing and shows particular highlights such as Man's first step  on the Moon, to later missions when astronauts had a lunar vehicle for  traveling on the barren landscape.  Brian Eno's music is perfect for this  feature; if you could hear music out there - this would be it.  Listening  to the astronauts as they narrate this feature is nice and makes you feel  even closer to them as you watch them progress through their missions.

7789374,4,0780022319,"3.5 of 5 stars, rounded up to 4 for good  measure:
Bluray review: I was seven-years old when Apollo 13 occurred: I was 10 years old when I saw Apollo-Soyuz live on TV: I was a freshman in HS when the Space Shuttle made it's maiden voyage. I also felt great sadness when in '86 the Challenger incident occurred - and years later Columbia. We moved to Houston in 1976 - and twice a year we visited NASA, because I 'loved' the history of space exploration as it unfolded in front of me.  It was a child-hood joy of mine to fantasize begin an astronaut - and NASA being an hour away, I had access to history.  I've seen many documentaries on space race/exploration. ' Apollo 13' is one of my favorite movies: 'From the Earth to the Moon' is one of my favorite mini-series:  'Failure is not an option' is my favorite documentary (goto Youtube).  That said, I purchased this documentary because I've started collecting Criterions - I now have 80-or-so DVDs/BR and out of prints.  Plus my fandom of NASA, space etc.  My opinion: this movie was... 'eh' - OK - nothing to write-home about!  As other reviewers indicated, the editing of this 90-min doc was atrocious!  The footages, some never before scene - were amazing.  The sequence footages started in Apollo 11, then jumped to Soyuz, to Apollo 13, back to 11, to 13, to 14 and on!  The story telling (voice-overs) were not labeled - who was taking about what?  65-min into the doc, I fell asleep.  There was no cohesiveness to this doc!  I had high expectations!
Transfer to Bluray: 4/5, impressive job on the Kennedy speech.
Editing: 2/5, as mentioned above
Story telling: 3/5 needs some work - voice caption was non existent
Criterion Packaging: 5/5 essentially the best part of the purchase

7789375,4,0780022319,"Not my favorite Apollo footage film (I think I like IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON the best), but still exciting to see so much footage from the missions and hear the words of the astronauts.

Pros: Footage is exclusively real Apollo mission footage. It's beautifully remastered.
The only voices you hear are those of the astronauts and men in the control center.
There is plenty of footage/mission recordings/astronaut commentary that I have never come across in other documentaries or books.

Cons: Teaches nothing of the science or politics involved in space travel. It is simply footage from the missions with no explanations.
Footage from multiple missions and comments from various astronauts is jumbled together. Footage is in order from take off to EVA in Earth orbit to traveling and landing in the Moon and returning, but none of it is labeled or explained. It is impossible the vast majority of the time to tell who is speaking or which mission's footage you are watching.

In summary, it is a bunch of cool footage, but it is best enjoyed by someone who already has a good understanding of the men and science of the Apollo program, or by someone who doesn't care about science or learning about the astronauts themselves, but just wants to see some footage of rockets and the Moon.",1482105600,3,1289,4.797297297297297
