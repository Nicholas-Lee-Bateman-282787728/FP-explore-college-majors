8397270,5,B003I3SR8I,"I really really enjoyed this series, much to my surprise. I've enjoyed Aya Ueta in several series, but thought she was really outstanding in this one. After deciding to apply for training as a flight attendant, young Misaki turns out to be a most problematic student in class. Going into it with the attitude that a flight attendant is little more than a flying waitress, she doesn't take the training all that seriously. Needless to say, it brings her into substantial conflict with her instructor, as well as the other, more refined, students in the class, who regard her as nothing more than an undisciplined juvenile (which, to be quite honest, she was.)

Somewhat predictably, the 'ugly duckling' does get her act together by the end of the series, and it's a pure joy watching Ueta get her 'hard knocks' all along the series until she's finally put in a position to have to grow up.

This series was voted #26 in the top 100 drama series on Jdorama.com, a site for information and reviews of Japanese television dramas (ie, mini-series). I agree, and it's one of my favorites.

The prices here on Amazon are somewhat higher than some other outlets, so it pays to check around. Nevertheless, if you've never viewed a Japanese television drama, I regard this one as an excellent place to start.",1392854400,,1298,4.734513274336283
