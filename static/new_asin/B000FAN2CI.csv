8119829,3,B000FAN2CI,"I thought this was going to be a 'making of' type documentary like the excellent one they did on the Beatles-based show in Las Vegas.  It isn't at all.  Instead, you see most of the show being performed on stage in front of an audience with some commentary by people behind the scenes.  It's a nice overview of La Nouba and makes a nice keepsake if you've seen the show.",1265414400,,370,4.257142857142857
