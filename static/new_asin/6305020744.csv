958582,5,6305020744,"This is a great installment in the OUATIC series.  Wong Fei-Hong in the old west, great action.  Sammo as Director brought some of his unique brand  of humor and with Jet Li you cant go wrong.  For Jet Li fans everywhere.",915580800,,221,4.317073170731708

958843,3,6305020744,"It was nice to see the old gang together again, but this movie was by far the worst in the series. Because it was made for a Chinese-speaking audience, the acting skills of the English-speaking actors was irrelevant, and in most cases it shows. English Asian film authority Bey Logan always laments the poor acting of English-speaking actors in Chinese-language films, and this movie is no exception.

Acting aside, the story itself meanders and makes little sense. [SPOILER ALERT!] Jet Li's character suffers amnesia and is taken in by local Native-Americans, doesn't learn a word of their language, marries a pretty Native-American girl, gets his memory back, returns to his Chinese comrades fighting the bad whities without a second thought to his whole Native-American experience, which could be a life-changing except that it all seemed to happen over the course of a day. The only point seemed to be to give his Chinese fiance something to be jealous about.

I was very disappointed. I was hoping to see turn-of-the-century San Francisco, a hotbed of oppression against Chinese 100 years ago. Or the building of the trans-Atlantic railway which exploited cheap Chinese labor and then sent them all back to China. But none of that. Just a hohum tale of small-town bigotry. An important story to tell, no doubt, but it could have been told much better.",1371427200,,1356,4.995575221238938
958844,5,6305020744,Jet Li reprises his role for the 5th time in Sammo Hung's Once Upon a Time in China & America...,1355875200,,96,3.85
958845,5,6305020744,"I see the reviews are pretty evenly scattered from 1 star to 5 stars and I certainly understand that,  its completely subjective.  If you are not already a fan of Hong Kong martial arts movies, you are likely to find a lot of fault with this movie, although you'll still be awe of the Jet Li's fight sequences.

However if you already are a fan of the genre, this is a terrific movie.  I think the first HK movie I saw years back was Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master"". Jet Li plays the same character although the movies couldn't be more different. Also they used the same theme music, although obviously a different version.  Both are great movies in there own way, Drunken Master highlighting Jackie Chan's clownish style,  Once Upon a Time in China shining with Jet's Li's charisma and graceful movements.

The opening sequence alone,  with the theme song playing and the hundreds of men moving through their Tai Chi sequence is worth the price of the DVD to me (although I loved all of it).  It is the Cantonese version of the theme with George Lam that I don't get tired of listening to.  The Mandarin version is sung by Jackie Chan, and just isn't quite as powerful for me.

If you are new to Hong Kong movies, try to look past some of the cheesy bits and the cartoonish westerners,  all of this is typical of the genre.  But there is plenty to enjoy here if you look past that.",1332979200,3,1381,4.41106719367589
958846,3,6305020744,"It was mostly what I expected. My subtitles didn't work right and kept displaying several seconds after they were talking. It may have colored the way I saw the movie, though.",1320796800,,175,4.67741935483871
958847,4,6305020744,"Okay, I have to admit that this movie is just for fun, nothing more.  I think my wife and I laughed more in this Western than any Western since Cat Ballou.  It is King Fu meets the Wild West!  I think this must be the only movie made where there had to be more stunt men than film crew!  Forget about a good story or drama - just watch the most unusual Western ever made and laugh out loud.  It'll do you good!",1210636800,,410,3.891566265060241
958848,3,6305020744,"Well, on the outside, it would appear that Jet Li had made a triumphant return to the series that made his career. In reality, this sequel falls short of the glory of the past titles. You should know that Jet Li was replaced for Once Upon a Time in China 4 and 5. (This being the sixth) Those movies were also very much below the quality of the first two. I suppose this movie does a better job than the Vincent Zhao vehicles that are OUATIC 4 and 5, but not by much. I must say these movies are very similar. I can tell you this, the storyline deals with the whole fish out of water ordeal. The big twist in this movie is that Jet Li bangs his head on a rock and thinks he is a native american indian. Then with some coaxing from his friend, Clubfoot, (read: fighting) he goes back to normal. In my opinion the romance between Jet Li and Roseamund Kwan has never been a strong point in the series. Much like Shanghai Noon, this movie goes out with a whimper, not a bang when Jet Li fights some evil looking goth cowboyesque character on top of a platform. I have to say, the fina fight scene is sub par for any Kung Fu Film and especially Jet Li. So in the end, go enjoy Once Upon a Time in China one and two. Go enjoy the gangster masterpiece Once Upon a Time in America, but be weary of the sub-par Kung Fu/Westerner that is Once Upon a Time in China and America. I recommend ""Rikki-Oh"" cause as far as Kung Fu movies, it's the poorest produced flick i have ever seen, but it's also the funniest. Check it out now.",1058140800,10,1517,4.111111111111111
958849,5,6305020744,"who cares about what the indians look like, or the main bad guys overuse of an eyebrow pencil?
This had everything you look for in a kung fu movie: action, humor and NO PLOT!!
All the people watching this who are taking it seriously, are watching the wrong movie.
This is the first movie i saw out of the ""once upon..."" series. I tried watching the first 3 after this one, and they paled in comparison.
So if you want to watch a first rate, cheesey kung fu movie, this is for you. If you want a documentary on Native American wardrobe, go watch the Discovery Channel.

958850,2,6305020744,"Although they managed to drag Jet Li back to the series for this installment, I personally wish they'd left the saga on the more respectable note that was the fourth sequel. Though the production values are high, with the American locations and actors being considerably better than in most HK films, the movie's plot is the weakest of the lot.
While Sammo Hung's direction makes the best visual use of the settings, it's suprisingly the action sequences that are the biggest let-down. The number of them is fairly frequent and the choreography is reasonable, but they are just too short to hold the attention. The failure to have a strong villian for Wong Fei-Hung to battle is also a major minus point.
There is also no attempt made to develop the characters and their relationships, as it seems the filmmakers think that dumping WFH and the gang in the middle of a Western is enough to justify making the film. It isn't.
It's a shame such a great series of movies signs off with such a weak parting shot. One for OUATIC completists only.",1029024000,3,1040,4.657608695652174
958987,3,6305020744,"A Wu Shu western, a la the old TV series ""Kung Fu."" Seeing Jet Li, after being taken in by American Indians, wearing pig tails on either side of his head and running up the front of his shirt is something everyone should see. The problem with this film is that the best fight scenes involve Clubfoot, now known as ""Seven."" Sammo Hung's directorial style has never been a favorite of mine (see ""Mr. Nice Guy"" and all the slo-mo action there), and this just reinforces that perception....",998784000,,486,4.534090909090909
958988,1,6305020744,"The story is not so bad (well... Shangai Noon, which is quite similar, is much better...) it's just badly directed. The fight scenes are unwatchable and the dialogues are quite poor. Wong Fei-hung (Jet Li) is out of character (for example: it's the first time that we see him giving long and boring speeches to everyone around) and some characters such as Foon Leung aren't even here. Also, you should see the bad make-up on the main villain... It's so ugly that you can't take the guy seriously.
As for the DVD... It's one of the worst I have bought so far. The sound isn't surround, which is unforgivable for a movie done at the end of the 90's. There's a 2 to 5 seconds delay for the subtitles to appear on screen, which is pretty annoying. The quality of the picture lets much to be desired. A ratio of 2.35:1 would have been a better choice to show the movie instead of the 1.85:1. And what's the fun to watch a ""making of"" in Cantonese language without the option of having english subtitles to follow it?
All in all, an episode to forget in the OUATIC series.",974764800,5,1066,4.388888888888889
958989,3,6305020744,"Wong Fei Hung (Jet Li) comes to the states with his ever present love interest Auntie Yee (the delectable Rosamund Kwan) only to be lost in some white water rapids, rendering him an amnesiac and adopted by Indians.  His entourage begin searching for him but are limited by the fact that they're Asians in the old West.  Sammo Hung returned to directing after a long, unsuccessful period with this film.  If upon viewing the film seems familiar, it's because it was actually an early version of the recent Jackie Chan film ""Shanghai Noon.""  I'm not calling Hung a rip off artist, as he's one of the most prolific, successful, and highly regarded Hong Kong directors of all time, but story has it that Hung, after a long streak of unsuccessful films, took the basic story as his own when Jackie Chan told him of his long time desire to make a modern Western.  Perhaps Hung did this due to the fact that he and Jackie had a falling out in the mid 80's which was only recently mended (the proof is the Sammo Hung directed MR. NICE GUY).  But even though Hung may have gotten the idea from Chan, you can't deny he did a good job with it.  Hung is a much better and capable director, in my opinion, than Chan, and has been for a long time, but for some reason Chan has managed to outshine not only Hung, but also Hong Kong superstars like Yuen Biao.  For those of you not in the know, Chan, Biao and Hung were all ""brothers"" at the Peking Opera School, all were trained torturously in martial arts, acrobats, acting, and stunt work.  As for Once...in America, it's not the best Jet Li movie, but it is a lot less sillier, and the fights more intricate, than most Jet Li films which are mainly period pieces and involve an embarrasingly large amount of wire work (as witness Tai Chi Master and most of the other Once upon a time films).  Hung proves himself once again to be a very talented director, as well as fight choreographer, but if you really want to see a great Sammo Hung film, check out PEDICAB DRIVER, MILLIONAIRE'S EXPRESS, or WHEELS ON MEALS, all with Sammo's special brand of razor sharp, intricate martial artistry.",972518400,7,2124,4.465116279069767
958990,2,6305020744,"I had a lot of hope for this film.  As a huge fan of the first two films in this series, I was excited to see the return of Jet Li to the role that  made him famous.  Also, I had hopes that Sammo Hung behind the camera could  only improve things...I was wrong.  The story is uninspired, a mix between  that Star Trek episode where Kirk loses his memory and ends up living with  Native Americans and...well, bad westerns.  The fight scenes, which are  supposed to be the hallmark of any HK actioner, were weak and shot poorly,  missing whatever art may have been there.  If you are interested in the  genre, avoid this picture and rent/buy the first two.  You want Cowboys and  Indians with martial arts...well, watch old ""Kung Fu"" episodes,  if you must.",966470400,2,754,4.401459854014599
958991,3,6305020744,"For real Jet Li fans this movie is ok, but was not really his style, of course Jet has to do some awesome fighting and was well worth watching.  The movie overall was a little too long and really was one that you'll be  happy that you saw him fight.  Like I said rent if possible.",960422400,,280,3.9642857142857144

958993,1,6305020744,"This has to the worst OUATIC  series. The Story plot was a laugh. Jet Li sounded like a little boy in this movie. Once again, he was the untouchable wong fei hong.

958994,2,6305020744,"When Jet Li stars as legendary Wong Fei-Hong, you know you're going to see lightning quick attacks and ferocious high flying exploits.  The only problem is that in all the Wong Fei-Hong movies combined, Fei-Hong has  almost never been hit during the fight scenes.  Every adversary prior to  this movie seemed relatively skilled.  But in this one none of these guys  stood a chance!  None of them had any skill at all!  If you just wanted to  watch fight scenes, you'll be sorely disappointed to watch Jet beat up a  bunch of Americans.  I suppose they were trying to focus more on the story  line (which was dreadfully mediocre!).  The previous Once Upon a Time in  China movies are much better.  If you can't get enough of Wong Fei-Hong  movies, try Iron Monkey!  It's a much more exciting movie.",928368000,,797,4.618705035971223

7881936,5,6305020744,Well this is the final chapter of the once upon a time Saga's. I like to say it was not as bad as I thought but it had some good fight scenes as you would expect from jet (Wong fai hong ). This completes my collection.
