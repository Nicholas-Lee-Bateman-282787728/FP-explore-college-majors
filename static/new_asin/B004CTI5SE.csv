4329175,5,B004CTI5SE,"Eoin Finn is great. He combines wonderful yoga practices with a spirituality of happiness and gratitude. Each day's routine focuses on different aspects of the body, with some being quite challenging (like Friday's strength and stretch routine) and some being quite calming (like Thursday's relaxation routine). I've now had this DVD for a year or so. It took me a little while to get into it because I preferred the music on Eoin's podcast yoga routines (which can be downloaded from iTunes or blissology.com), but this DVD has really grown on me and I now do these routines almost daily. The biggest downside it that I get jealous that I'm not also doing yoga in the beautiful Bali scenery.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1381795200,2,722,4.82258064516129

4329180,5,B004CTI5SE,"I've had other yoga DVDs and I always end up getting tired of hearing the instructor teaching and saying the same things over and over.  This one is awesome because there is a practice for each day of the week!  I don't even use the Saturday or Sunday practices because they are a lot of meditation, and I usually want more of a physical work out when I do yoga.  So, if I practice on Saturday or Sunday I just pick one of the M-F DVDs and do that practice.  Even with doing one or two of the practices twice a week I have yet to get tired of any of them.  They are very well rounded, each day has a different focus area.  Love it.",1363910400,,631,3.9682539682539684

The yoga practices are challenging and beautiful, and each practice has a meditation to go along with it.  The reason I love it so much is because this is so much more than just a yoga practice.  There is a very strong spiritual side to this practice, which is very important to me.  I have been doing this practice for about 6 weeks now and I am feeling more and more fit both physically and spiritually.  I have many yoga DVD's that I use, but with this practice I am never bored!

4329189,2,B004CTI5SE,"I found that the pose sequences were off. I think he is not preparing the body for some quite difficult and strenuous poses. My body did not feel good after many of the classes.
I also don't find the benefit of a 10 minutes meditation when the guy speak 6 minutes out of 10. If at least he could let the music play longer after he speak. I need silence to be able to go deep.",1326672000,7,375,3.9473684210526314
4329190,5,B004CTI5SE,"The Blissology Project by yogi, surfer, and self-described ""blissologist"" Eoin Finn is a 6-disk DVD set covering every day of the week (5 disks for each of Monday through Friday, and then a shared 6th disk for Saturday/Sunday).  It offers not just yoga sessions (11 total) but also daily meditations as well as ""Blissology Commitments,"" which involves a a total yogic approach in various areas of one's life.

With the exception of the Saturday/Sunday disk (which is structured slightly differently), each weekday Main Menu offers the following options:  Theme (a short introduction to the theme for that day), Meditation (described as being 10 minutes but in reality, varies from about 8.5 minutes to 11.5 minutes), Full Yoga Routine (varies from about 45 minutes to 55 minutes), Yoga Quickie (a shorter version of the main routine running from around 27 minutes to about 36 minutes), and Blissology Commitments.  The latter address not only yoga and meditation but also nature appreciation, food awareness, gratitude, and ""wild card.""  In these short segments, Eoin simply encourages increased reflection, awareness, and gratitude around these issues without being preachy or sanctimonious (if you disagree, however, you can easily ignore these sections).

Eoin is accompanied for almost all of the yoga sessions by his wife, Insiya; sometimes they are joined by another yogi, and Monday's class is a bit larger.  His brand of yoga is fairly unique, although it generally in the vinyassa style.  Perhaps being influenced by the beautiful Bali setting in which Blissology was filmed, however, Eoin is generally quite chill in these routines:  although he does throw in more challenging postures, particularly arm balances (especially in the full practices), overall, he moves through the yoga at a measured pace.  (For a full listing of poses for each practice, go to Eoin's Blissology web site.)

However, I would caution that that Blissology is NOT designed for beginners.  Although Eoin does include a modifier for most of the practices and also encourages viewers to go at their own pace, there is very little actual instruction in these routines.  Also, as noted above, there are a fair number of more advanced postures included--for example, crow pose is quite common even in the quickie routines.  A more experienced beginner who has knowledge of how to modify might be able to follow along, but someone brand-new to yoga is very likely to be overwhelmed.

Here are a few additional notes about the Blissology set:
*Eoin cues live.  However, sometimes the audio is a bit off, so it can feel more like a mix of live and voiceover cuing.  Also, he does NOT mirror-cue to the viewer.
*The quickie practices are simply shortened versions of the full routines.  However, the cuts are completely seamless; it never felt to me like something was missing from the shorter practices.  One thing to keep in mind is that shorter does not necessarily mean EASIER!  Sometimes the quickie practices didn't contain the more advanced poses, but sometimes they did.
*Saturday's practice is a combined yoga and meditation; for this practice, Eoin and Insiya lead viewers through a metta or loving kindness meditation (six rounds of sun salutations sending out love to specific targets).  Sunday consists of a meditation only, no yoga.
*The packaging is amazing!  When I received it, I couldn't believe that it contained all six DVDs.  They are ingeniously tucked away, three per side, WITHOUT overlapping in the case, which is only slightly wider than the case for a single DVD.

Overall, I have found that I am really enjoying this set.  I was initially a bit hesitant to obtain it, as I thought that 1) I might be too overwhelmed about the number of choices, and 2) that Eoin's vinyasa style might be too fast for me.  I needed have worried, however, as I love the daily format, including the option to choose a shorter or longer practice, and I am really clicking with Eoin's slow flow routines.  Highly recommended!",1326585600,3,4009,5.044006069802731
4329191,5,B004CTI5SE,"Let me start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of ""power"" yoga. I've always been a bit more of a light yoga person...yoga zone, yoga for surfers 1, raviana and Namaste yoga have been my staples up until now. I have tried a couple of previous Eoin DVDs (pure and simple yoga, PY4H1) but couldn't get into them.

But this Blissology set? Wow!!! Amazing and truly inspiring. I NEVER liked sun salutations until now. Eoin makes them fun and relaxed, and he goes at a lovely pace, not fast at all...just right. A lot slower than his earlier DVD offerings. There's always a modifier, which is extremely helpful when Eoin and his ""bliss army"" go into more advanced poses.

Eoin? What can I say, he is a fabulous instructor in this set. His cueing is wonderful and the verbal expressions he uses are clear and lovely to listen to. It's rare that I have to look at the screen to see what's going on.

All of the DVDs were filmed in Bali...gorgeous, gorgeous. The music is 95% wonderful and complements the practices exceptionally well.

I enjoy all of the 6 practices in this set...in particular Monday, Thursday and the absolutely incredible Saturday practice gets me to a very positive and happy place. Friday's practice is tough as heck...it will never be my favorite but I will use it nonetheless because I know it's good for me...kind of like broccoli!

The meditations are short and perfect for a meditation beginner/novice. I truly hope that viewers use these as a meditation starting point and continue to meditate (with or without Eoin), as I find daily meditation to be one of the best ways to still/free the mind and promote overall change in one's life.

I don't give 5 stars to very many of my reviews, but I'm going to give 5 ""upward spiral"" stars to this set. How can I not?  Eoin has gotten me to practicing yoga daily, and it feels awesome.",1314057600,31,1847,4.528528528528528
4329192,5,B004CTI5SE,"I received the 6 CD set as a gift, and am very thankful!

I travel a lot and will surely enjoy having these routines to follow on the road.  The filming, location, and the way in with Eion brings you into the postures all combine for a wonderful experience.

I like the flexibility in the ""quickie"" routines, or the longer version, time permitting.  That is a great and convenient idea.

Highly recommend.",1310860800,,405,4.569444444444445
4329193,5,B004CTI5SE,"After owning this disc series for a few months, I find that I am really happy with it. At first, I thought that the routines were too easy and short. And they are shorter and a bit easier than his earlier discs. However, there are quite a few new poses and pose combinations that are quite interesting. I find that I use these discs more than I ever thought I would. There are 2 discs that I almost never use (Saturday, which is just meditation movements, and the Restorative day, which is way to easy for me), but I find that I am getting a lot of use from the other 4 discs.

My favorite Eion Finn DVD is Power Yoga for Happiness. It is one of my all time favorite yoga routines, and it's probably the reason that I continue buying Eion's new DVDS. This series of DVDs was probably, in a way, a response to people finding his last 2 DVDs a bit too challenging and long. I didn't think his past two DVDs were too challenging or long, but they lacked a certain warmness, which is not as lacking on this DVD series.

The routines are either Eion alone, with his wife, with is wife and another woman, or with a group of 7 people. Mostly they are fairly decent yogis. These are short routines: the longest is 55 minutes, but take off about 8 minutes for shavasana and intoductory remarks. Most are 45 minutes or less, with even shorter ""quickie"" options.

The workouts are basically easier than on his previous 2 discs, and the music is a bit nicer. Quite a number of the songs were used on Shiva Rea discs. The filming is not as briiliant as it was on Yoga For Happiness: not too many close-ups or interesting angles. The routines are filmed in fields and on the beach in Bali, and usually the cameras are far or at non-so-ideal angles.

I do yoga daily at home, so I need a variety of DVDs. There a six discs, and I like Friday and Monday the best (most challenging), I also use Tuesday and Wednesday a bit, but Wednesday is for when I feel like something more mellow.  I buy a lot of discs and only ever end up using about a third of them, so I have found that these discs get used!  It's a big complement, because I have a lot of discs and each day's routine is important to me!

All of the blissology ideas are nice, but I didn't watch them more than once!

All in all, it's still a good buy for my money. Even though I only use 4 of the 6 discs, it still works out to only $12.50 a routine. Not bad.

This is surely a worthy addition to any fan of Vinyassa yoga's disc collection.",1309392000,16,2483,4.167014613778706

8423646,5,B004CTI5SE,"This is an excellent series.  I read reviews and looked for online snippets before buying.  I'm so glad I bought this. It's one of my all-time favorite yoga DVD sets.

Instructor:  For those unfamiliar with Eoin Finn, he's got a laid-back surfer yogi vibe going on.  After practicing with his DVDs, I'm ready to seek out one of his real-life classes.  His wife is also in the practices.

Music: The music is beautiful and relaxing.

Scenery: It's filmed outdoors in Bali, with beach scenes, temple scenes, field scenes and more. I loved hearing the ocean in the background during quiet times.

The practices:  A modifier is show in each practice.  I like that each day's practice has a full-length version and a quickie.  A nice savasana is included, unlike in so many yoga DVDs.  They flow but poses are also held, building endurance and allowing for one to breathe through tightness or tension.

Meditation:  Each day has a separate meditation with a daily theme.

I hope Eoin creates another set like this, one with daily meditations, themes and shorter versions of longer practices.  This is an exceptional program for those seeking a blissed out yoga experience.",1398643200,3,1167,4.872448979591836

There are only 4 spots in the case, so I'm not sure what happened as the back of the case indicates there are 6 DVDs. If you are purchasing from the secondary market, I would be wary of this and make sure to open your package right away to confirm you received all the DVD's.  The workouts are good enough, but it would be nice to have all 6 days instead of 4.

The seller was excellent and refunded my money and allowed me to keep the remaining DVD's.
