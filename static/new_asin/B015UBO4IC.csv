8734627,3,B015UBO4IC,"Greatly disappointed in this effort. Received yesterday, watched last night, placing into the ""delete from library"" file just after. The story takes place 21 years after the destruction, by super heroic efforts of one of the Shogun's trusty minions, of Commodore Perry's Black Fleet which, as you know, didn't happen. The Tokagawa Shoganate is still in power but crumbling, although the people in Nagasaki,where this story takes place, are unaware of it. Our hero, Keiichiro, the battle-scared loud-mouth 17-year-old virgin grandson of the hot bath owner, has just ""conquered"" Nagasaki and wants more action; to keep him a virgin for future use, a curse was placed on him to give him hives if he ever got close to any female. That's how this boring effort starts. In no particular order, there is neither fan service nor nudity beyond still drawings of partially naked women in the bath house with nothing, (read; incomplete breasts, just lumps of flab) showing, and skimpy but non-reveling outfits on the female cast even though most of the female cast sports D+'s.
The biggest disappointment with this costly mistake is the motions of the players; it is almost like watching pages being flipped in a manga with a sound track playing in the background. There couldn't be more than a third of the cells normally used. A person is often drawn once then pushed onto the ""stage"" and moved around a little to simulate movement, the ""camera"" often appears to move around stills and streaking lines are everywhere there is suppose to be action usually instead of action drawings. Except the lips. As it seemed to be far too often, these artists cannot draw action and have the character talk at the same time, a still will have some of the best mouth action I've seen is some time.
The promised ""steam powered"" robots seldom appeared, were not that impressive when they did and there was nothing to suggest they were, in fact, steam powered. The airship had a smoke stack and on of the minor robots had her boiler punctured but, there is little to nothing here to excite a giant robot fan.
Altogether, while the character designs are very good and the colors are bright, overall it is a waste of time and money. Directly as a result of this disappointment, I have gone through my pending orders, here and elsewhere and made sure no other Sentai offerings were either on order or on any wish list.
Lastly, the cover art, you know, the one showing a gaggle of naked cuties with a censor slash cutting across the ""vital"" parts, it's a fraud. Nothing like that happens and the cover was intended to deceive.",1449878400,48,2597,4.773333333333333
