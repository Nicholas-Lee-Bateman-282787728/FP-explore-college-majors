8381399,3,B002UOMGVK,"The trailer made the laughs and odd moments seem more frequent and the premise really allows for non-stop laughs. The actual film fell more than a bit short. Still a good movie with a slow pace and plenty of take it easy moments. If you want to sit and relax to a slower movie this isn't bad at all. A good time waster on a slow bad weather day. Not as much drinking, drinking rules, awkward moments, and funny drunken interactions and nonsense as it should have had.",1403568000,,467,4.318181818181818
8381400,4,B002UOMGVK,"This movie does not hype up any theatrics or make unfulfilled promises to the viewer.  Instead, it is EXACTLY what the synopsis says it is.  A young man (Song Sam-Dong), down on his luck with love, decides hesitantly to go on a road trip with his buddies.  After his friends twist his arm to go, they get so drunk they pass out and forget to meet him the next day.  Debating whether or not to just go home, he decides to take advantage of the free time and go ""exploring"" anyway.  The misadventures that follow are the result of all the soju (pictured on the front of the dvd case) purchased by and offered to Hyuk-jin, the lead role.

The way this movie is presented constantly makes you feel like you are watching a documentary instead of a studio produced feature.  There are no special effects, explosions, action sequences, or car chases, which seem to make viewing this movie that much more endearing.  Without unnecessary distractions, the viewer is left to feel like they are going through this experience with Hyuk-jin.  The frustration he goes through does make the viewer feel bad for him in some cases.  But it's not ALL a downer.  There are some funny and quirky moments in the film that brought a smile and a chuckle to my face.  And those moments happen in random enough intervals that you wouldn't necessarily anticpate them.  So it does tend to feel like organic humor.

The scenery and musical score are both beautiful in their own ways, as they contribute to the overall tone.  There are plenty of panoramic shots of the Korean countryside, and even a scene spent at the beach.  The music is simple and not synthesized.  Both scenery and music go fittingly into our lead's journey, propelling him to whatever ""next stop"" he's headed to.

Hyuk-jin encounters a number of different characters, each one in their own way, leading him to some sort of mishap, all of them still carrying on the etiquette of proper Korean drinking, no matter how informal.  These interactions take place in various locations ranging from bus stops to guest houses to a karaoke bar.  While the proper Korean drinking rules are never expressly given, the inside of the dvd case has them listed and defined.  It was interesting to read those rules and then watch them portrayed throughout the movie.  You might even be able to make your own drinking game out of it ; ).

This movie wasn't made to have thrills and spills, gashes and gore, or even redundant stupidity.  It is a ""slice of life"" film, intended for the viewer to join Hyuk-jin in his mini-adventure and potentially share his experiences, good or bad, by pouring a shot of soju, and drinking them down one by one.",1305244800,5,2668,4.639658848614072
