The synopsizes come from Wikipedia.

Eye of the Beholder:  Mirage puts Aladdin's love for Jasmine to the ultimate test. Disguised as a peddler woman, she gives Jasmine a lotion that she says will transform her into something more worthy of her man, but it slowly changes her into a snake woman.  I vividly remember seeing this episode on TV.  I remember thinking it must've scared my sister (it wasn't exactly pleasant for me either).  This is a wonderful story about love triumphing over evil.  Also, Mirage is a great villain.  A+

Sandswitch:  One night, the street rat turned sorceress Sadira casts a spell over Agrabah. The next morning, everyone's memory has been rearranged so that Sadira is the princess and Jasmine is a street rat. However, the spell doesn't work on animals.  It's up to Abu, Iago, & Rajah to find Jasmine & break the spell!  I don't remember this episode, but I remember seeing Sadira's first appearance (Strike Up the Sand) on TV.  Both are excellent episodes but this is my favorite of the 2.  In fact, I'd say this is tied with Some Enchanted Genie as my favorite episode.  A+

So that's all the Aladdin episodes I'll be reviewing until Disney puts it on DVD.  Yeah I know, that'll be the day.  They probably wouldn't even finish it, but I'd still buy whatever they put out.  This would play in my ideal Disney Afternoon, along with Chip N' Dale Rescue Rangers, Gummi Bears & Gargoyles.",1365552000,2,1550,4.649446494464945
