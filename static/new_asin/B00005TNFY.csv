1661520,5,B00005TNFY,"The Bee Gees as always put on an excellent concert.  They sound great live as they do on any album.  This concert was more touching since the recent passing of maurice gibb and the way he interacts with the audience and fans who call in.  So, there are some funny moments with him and the rest of the Bee Gees.  I would recommend everybody watch this concert.  My family also watched and loved it.  You will not be disappointed.  I love it when Barry sings ""How can you mend a broken heart.""  Robin's ""Massachutettes"" and ""I started a joke""  which he sings the same way as he did when it was first recorded.  Maurice's ""Man in the Middle"" I love all his songs from their ""This is where I came in"" album.  They sing 5 of their songs from this album which are great.  My personal favorite ""Jive Talkin"" I plan to buy more of their concerts which I plan to do reviews on.  All the Best!  Happy Viewing!  Angela",1047772800,10,907,4.252941176470588
1661521,5,B00005TNFY,"This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous!  It was even fun listening to the request call-ins.  Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live.  Love those guys!! Also, they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts.  I highly recommend this DVD!",1043625600,3,356,4.348484848484849
1661522,4,B00005TNFY,of course it's really good to hear all the Bee Gees Jams on a Album but live is even better.the only down side is the fact that some of the songs are done in Medley form&that kinda leaves it just there overall to me.but all in all this is a real good show&performance.,1033689600,2,268,4.0754716981132075
1661523,5,B00005TNFY,"This concert is truly AMAZING!! The selection of songs is great, and they are all perfectly performed. But there's more besides the music itself.
This concert really show how EXTREMELY FUNNY the Brothers Gibb are. Especially Maurice.
Also, my sincere compliments to mister John Merchant, who has done a MARVELLOUS job, on mixing the sound (of the DVD; don't know about the VHS).
Pump up your speaker volume, sit back and enjoy this memorable concert...",1012348800,2,452,5.04
1661524,5,B00005TNFY,"Recording with an audience of less than 1,000, this DVD feels like a club recording with it's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound.  Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request' gimmick is not original.  Still, it manages to captivate.  Fifteen songs (one a medley of eight), five being from the last album, it's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies.  ""She Keep On Coming"" and ""You Should Be Dancing"" rock the house, while ""Sacred Trust"" and ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart"" lull the audience into a trance.  This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins' and lots of joking around.  Its surprising to hear Barry sing, ""Woman In Love"", but ""Nights On Broadway"" is, once again, cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work.
This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning.  ""One Night Only"" is a great live recording as well, but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation.",1012003200,41,1011,4.552486187845304
1661525,5,B00005TNFY,"...I not only have this video but I'm buying another one just to have has back-up!!
This video has got to be one of the most entertaining Bee Gee videos I have ever seen.  The live phone calls and emails only enhances the fun of this video.  The interaction only gives Barry, Robin and Maurice the opportunity to not only have a great time but to show their witty and great personalities.  Maurice is absolutely hilarious to watch through out the entire concert.  It's very obvious the brothers are having a wonderful time.
Their musical performance is exceptional.  The vocal ranges and harmonies are better now than 30 years ago. The maturity in their vocals has only enhanced their sound.  Incredible indeed!
I not only recommend buying this video I think it would be a sin not to.  You would only be cheating yourself out of a great time.  ""This is Where I Came In"" is an exceptional new Bee Gee's album and their performance of those songs on this video is dynamic.  You will be off your seat dancing that's for sure.
If you buy it and hate it ...well you may want to check to see if you are alive and breathing.  TEN STARS FOR SURE !!!!!!",1010188800,18,1144,4.430622009569378
1661526,5,B00005TNFY,"Not only am I a huge Fan of the BeeGees and enjoyed this video very very much, but I was honored to have been a part of the audience that night!  The editorial written here DOES NOT give justice.  It was an ABSOLUTE, awesome and unforgetable night and this Videos is surely to entertain and give every BeeGee Fan a great two hours worth of your life.  I can guarantee you'll laugh, you'll clap, stomp your feet, while singing along to every song in the video.  A MUST FOR EVERY BEEGEE FAN...",1010188800,2,491,4.304347826086956

1661542,5,B00005TNFY,"A first rate Live By Request show  from the Bee Gees. Their mastery of pop music is appreciated even more when you hear them live. Buy this and the ""One Night Only"" DVD. Great stuff!",1406678400,,182,4.2
1661543,5,B00005TNFY,"Saw this when it came on tv, saw it in a store and had to have it.....this is known as Mo's last live performance....so to miss this chance to own this is a shame....one any Bee Gee fan must own",1403568000,,194,3.875
1661544,1,B00005TNFY,"The Bee Gees are great in this  DVD.  They are warm, welcoming and appreciative for the attention shown them.  From all that I've learned about the brothers Gibb, they were very grateful for the love shown them by their fans.  This is evident in this DVD though it arrived to me in a scratched, damaged condition, I was able to enjoy it once or twice.  A new one would be worth purchasing though not for more than $30.00.  No DVD is worth the hundreds of dollars some of the sellers are asking for this one in particular.  Shame on you, sellers!  Stop bilking the public!!",1401062400,,572,4.380952380952381
1661545,5,B00005TNFY,This show was so funny and they sang so beautifully.  Robin Gibb's voice never aged.  They were relaxed and completely enjoyed themselves and the audience loved them.,1396051200,,166,5.111111111111111

1661564,5,B00005TNFY,"As Described. They have crossed many age barriers. Popular everywhere they went. I have been building my music video collection for some time. I did not want this to get by. As a performing group, they will be missed.",1339545600,,217,4.589743589743589
1661565,4,B00005TNFY,"This is the last live performance DVD done by the Brothers Gibb before the untimely death of Maurice. The Bee Gees are in great form. they do their classics as well as four songs from their album ""This is where I came in"".

1661580,5,B00005TNFY,"I purchased two DVDs, one for my parents who are huge Bee Gee fans (they're in their late 60s) and one for myself.  As African Americans our (my family) taste in music is culturally diverse and the Bee Gees are on the top of our lists.  This concert is a definite must see ranking right up there with their ""One Night Only"" concert.  Several songs on this DVD I've never heard before but they have become my favorites. The Bee Gees were very playful/silly/funny in this concert which was a treat to see that different aspect of the group.",1243900800,,538,4.414141414141414
1661581,4,B00005TNFY,"This is a fine performance by the Bee Gees who perform ""by request"", probably the most difficult format for live performers.  They play most of their songs and most fans might complain about various hits that were omitted.  Still an enjoyable performance.",1168819200,,255,5.0476190476190474
1661582,3,B00005TNFY,"This BeeGee DVD was originally recorded for a live TV broadcast. The Bee Gees perform great, but the flow and the build up that you usually experience during a concert, is CONTSTANTLY interrupted by a presenter who tends to turn eveything into a commercial TV spot. Questions like ""what did you think when you had your first number one hit"" brilliantly answered by Robin ""Gee, our first number one hit"".... Daft questions, ennoying interruptions, superficial presenting and constantly complimenting the BeeGee's (the Bee Gees don't need that constant sort of kissing up from a presenter) ... The MUSIC itself is great although the songs are all kept very short. Please, let concerts be concerts and interviews be interviews.",1102464000,9,724,5.1440677966101696

1661584,5,B00005TNFY,"Alright, I admit the ""phone in"" gimmick is corny and a distraction, but you can simply fast forward the calls. Buy this for the music, which is absolutely gorgeous. The Bee Gees have always given stellar live performances, replicating their original records as close as possible. Well, I have news: this live performance beats any I have heard, it's *that good.* The Bee Gees, like McCartney, have always taken great pains to sing their songs live as closely as possible to the original. I appreciate this and their efforts to duplicate their classics here meet with much success. Particularly amazing is Robin's haunting, gorgeous vocal on ""I Started a Joke,"" one of the great Bee Gees of all time. Similarly impressive is ""New York Mining Disaster,"" which shows the brothers still had the ability to harmonize beautifully.
The only slight criticism is Barry's high notes and falsetto, which he strains to reach, especially on ""Stayin' Alive."" He's backed up with some invisible (and pre-recorded) mystery voices, but his ability to sustain the high notes has decreased with time. Personally, I don't care. This is an awesome live performance and for anyone who admires the brothers Gibb, this is something from which you'll derive hours of enjoyment.",1085270400,17,1252,5.08252427184466
