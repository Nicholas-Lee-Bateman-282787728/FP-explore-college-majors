1803671,5,B00007AJHS,"This 4 tape set by Rainbeau Mars is a treasure of Yoga Gold with many unique colours. I love this set so much that I'm reviewing it for the second time now that I've gotten to use it for well over a year.
 If you only owned one set of Yoga Videos I would say this would be one of my top choices without a doubt (and this opinion is based on my experience with over 70 yoga programs in addition to studying with an amazing teacher). The reason I would choose this particular set is that there is so much variety between these tapes that you can choose one on any given day depending on your level of energy or depending on what you want to focus on.
What is special about this series is that each of these programs is completely unique. Many Sets of Yoga programs are basically the same routine with more poses added (or harder variations) rather than unique programs unto themselves. Rather these programs are completely different from each other. What's nice about this is that you can actually alternate these programs each day or combine them if you have more time without the routines overlapping.
The first two tapes ""Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" are gentle tapes that let you melt into wonderful yoga flows that will make you feel incredible as you open up your body, mind and spirit with movement and breath.
The last two tapes ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"" will challenge you and push you to new levels of strength, endurance and flexibility while maintaining the true essence of yoga which is awareness and breathing.
Rainbeau Mars is a wonderful and inspiring teacher who comes across with real depth and sincerity. You feel like she's right there with you leading you through the practice. She's a real yoga teacher and not an aerobics teacher who decided to do a yoga video because it's the ""in thing"" .
Also, these tapes clock in at about 30 minutes so they are very easy to fit into anyone's schedule so there are not reasons to ever skip a day of Yoga.
 When your ready to move on to a wonderful intermediate practice I also recommend Sherri Baptiste Freeman's ""Power Of Yoga"" which is available on Amazon as well (see my detailed review).
Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1803674,5,B00007AJHS,"I love these videos!  Rainbeau Mars is now one of my two favorite instuctors, (the other being Rodney Yee).  She narrates each session, so the flow of the asanas isn't interupted.  The first two videos are pretty easy, so they are good for beginners, but also very resorative, so anyone could benefit from them.  The second two are more challenging, and build heat, but they are still good for beginners.  I can't stop raving about these tapes!  I get so absorbed in the workout, that it's over before I know it!  I highly recommend this set to anyone who's serious about yoga!",1055548800,25,577,4.598039215686274
1803704,5,B00007AJHS,I think Rainbeau Mars is one of the best Yoga instructors out there. I love this DVD Set. But I would not recommend this for beginners. Some of the asanas can be a bit challenging.,1207094400,,180,4.171428571428572
1803705,5,B00007AJHS,"I had heard that yoga gave a good workout, but had no idea until I received this set.  You will sweat, but feel so good afterward.  I needed something that would be good for my back and also relieve a lot of stress.  Rainbeau s very competent and gives great direction.  You can set your own pace, and while she's explaining the moves, once you get it down, you can do several before she moves to the next move.  So, you can make it burn, or make it meditative.",1204588800,,461,4.134831460674158

This is the best Yoga CD I own.  Use it everyday.  The Beginners are Tranquility are the best for beginners but definitely may be difficult for the older crowd.  I love them and use mostly Beginners everyday.  Tried many but love Rainbow Mars.  It helps to have had a yoga class prior to using a CD.  This is a must purchase for any beginner.  The Pure Power and Pure Sweat are not for beginners.  They are something to move towards after using the beginner and tranquility CD's.  Thank you Rainbow Mars!",1182988800,,867,6.535087719298246
1803707,5,B00007AJHS,"I really like this set. Rainbeau is a lovely instructor: she has a very sweet, calm and encouraging presence, and  the slow flow style of these programs is exactly what I wanted.  I never got the PEACE aspect of yoga begore.

  I've tried Iyengar yoga (tapes and and classes), but the ""let's do pose A.  Okay, now let's do pose B"" format felt too fragmented and, well, like exercise.  I tried power yoga as well (DVDs from two instructors), but I always felt like I was rushing to keep up.  Rainbeau's slowly-flowing sequences were a perfect balance:  the smooth progression of poses made the whole program feel like a single dance, which really kept me in the moment.  I always had enough time to mindfully execute the transition between poses, and enough time to really feel the poses as I held them.

  That's not to say it's easy: moving slowly is actually harder than moving quickly, because it's easier to cut corners when you go quickly.  Going slowly forces you to use the muscles that support the intermediate positions that you pass through on the way.  Plus, the poses can be as intense as you need them to be, as long as you choose the appropriate disk for your level, and push yourself to do each one with intention and commitment.

My only complaint:  in the beginner program, there seems to be an error in the voiceover timing during the alternating lunges section.  If you follow her voice exactly, you'll end up doing your lunge on the second leg for much longer than on the first.  Once I figured this out, it was easy to deal with, but it's something to watch out for.",1136073600,9,1587,4.524647887323944
1803708,5,B00007AJHS,"i really like rainbeau mars...she really knows how to narrate the video. i have some where they talk to you like you're an idiot..or they just don't sound too intelligent. but listening to rainbeau throughout the videos is really relaxing and helpful. i have done the tranquility, sweat, and strength videos and they are all great. and she really focuses on relaxing for a while after the workout too. probably my favorite yoga videos from what i've tried out!",1128643200,3,460,4.8354430379746836
1803709,5,B00007AJHS,"I bought this four-volume set based on the description of other Amazon customers and was not disappointed. I have several yoga tapes but the ""Beginners"" volume of this set has been my favorite since I purchased three months ago. It's gentle but challenging, especially if you listen carefully to her instructions. I also like the fact that she incorporates some of the philosophy of yoga into the practice, bringing a spiritual dimension that -- depending on your mood -- can feel quite uplifting. And Rainbeau's emphasis on the importance of coordinating breath and movement adds yet another dimension, making this feel like a very full practice, though it is only about a half hour.

Rainbeau is a great instructor. She is a very positive and encouraging throughout. It's as close to having the benefits of a ""live"" instructor as I've found.

The ""Tranquility"" tape is also great. Though I prefer ""Beginners"" as a daily practice, I do enjoy this tape for night or weekend practices, or when I have a greater need to unwind from stress. It is designed to prepare you for meditation, though I simply use it to stretch and decompress. As an inflexible person, I did find some of the stretches a little painful and slightly injured myself doing one. I need to remind myself to take it easy and accept my limitations. On the whole, though, it's a very mellow and satisfying practice.

I have tried to do the other two volumes of the set, but found them too difficult. I like that I have them, with the idea that it's something to work toward: to get to the point where I have the flexibility and stamina to make it completely through one. But I honestly would have been satisfied with just the purchase of the ""Beginners"" and ""Tranquility"" volumes, as someone who at this point is content to experience yoga in the slow lane.",1112227200,4,1822,4.705329153605016
1803710,4,B00007AJHS,"Rainbeau has a done a great job with these DVDs.  They are nicely produced, have great scenery and sound.  The routines are interesting and not too challenging for the intermediate student but would probably be OK for the beginning student.  I usually prefer a longer routine, at least an hour.  The routine is read by Rainbeau and it lacks feeling or passion, sounds very scripted. The poses are described very well and I found myself reaching for new places. Overall very good but the serious student will want longer routines with more feeling.",1106697600,5,547,4.849462365591398
1803711,3,B00007AJHS,"There was nothing on the packaging to indicate that each video is only about a half hour long - I was looking for a longer workout.  Good instruction, beautiful background.  I suppose it would be a good video to pop in if you only have a short amount of time, but if I only have 30 minutes, I'd probably do exercise other than yoga.",1102118400,2,332,4.171875
1803712,4,B00007AJHS,"The four routines in this set provide a nice variety of yoga practices which are applicable to a wide range of yoga practitioners, from experienced beginners to more advanced yoga students. The practices are led by Rainbeau Mars, who offers voiceover instruction in a calm soothing voice. Her mirrored cueing is excellent (although sometimes slightly out-of-sync with her movements on screen), and she is obviously very knowledgeable about yogic principles and traditions as well as anatomical issues. In addition, the practices are filmed in Hawaii against beautiful backdrops.

The most basic practice in this series is Pure Tranquility, which is designed to prepare the body and mind for meditation. The entire practice is performed in a seated position, and Rainbeau guides you through gentle stretches to open the body and relax the muscles. The Beginners video actually offers a bit of a challenge and requires some pre-existing strength. In this practice, Rainbeau begins slowly with breathing exercises and warm-up stretches. She continues with several vinyasa flow series, still moving slowly but holding some poses (such as downward dog) for an extended period of time.

The remaining two practices in this set are significantly more challenging than the first two. In Pure Power, Rainbeau builds on a series of sun salutations by adding rigorous poses such as side plank, crescent lunges, chair, and 3-legged down dog. Pure Sweat further picks up the pace by adding additional lunges and twists as well as plenty of yogi push-ups (chatturangas). Although these two practices are definitely at an intermediate/advanced level, Rainbeau performs them at a leisurely pace and does not include inversions, thus making the practices extremely accessible.

One of the things I like best about this series is that each practice is only 30 minutes long, which is especially rare for intermediate/advanced practices. However, the videos could be easily combined to form an hour long workout if desired: Beginners would make a perfect warm-up for Pure Sweat, and Pure Tranquility would work well for winding down after Pure Power.

As an intermediate yogi who has been practicing yoga for several years now, I would not recommend this set for those totally new to yoga: while Rainbeau's cueing is excellent, her instruction is not overly detailed, and she does not offer modifications for the poses. However, beginners who have had some prior experience with yoga can start with the first two videos and build up to the remaining two over time. Finally, this series is not for someone who is looking for a fast-paced, power yoga or ashtanga-type practice, as everything about Rainbeau is laid back and relaxed. Rather, this set is perfect for intermediates looking for softly flowing practices which will provide a gentle challenge to their home practice.",1093564800,59,2855,5.254385964912281

7974605,5,B00007AJHS,"This set is so wonderful because I was looking for a teacher who is coming from the sacredness of the practice and is conversant with the real names of the asanas and the way to teach them that is beautiful.
What a relief to find the older style of yoga again, not a hyper weight loss dvd.
I practice one of the dvds each day and it is never boring because I hear something new each time in her quiet subtle delivery.
She feels authentic and it is well produced in an Ocean setting.

7974606,5,B00007AJHS,"My daughter started doing yoga, so I thought I would look into it.  As a raw beginner and de-conditioned, I wondered how to start.  The beginner's tape/DVD is perfectly paced with supplemental poses for when you need more.  Of course, the other disks in the set will take you farther as well, but I was so pleased to get going on this and it feels amazing.  I was not very interested in the more ethereal side of yoga as a bio major, but her references are very tolerable and she does relax you.  Also, as a beginner, I have found her instructions to be very clear and helpful in performing the various poses and getting a lot out of them. This is a great way to get a feel for this, although my daughter was skeptical that a tape would be as helpful as an instructor; but I have found the beginner tape to be so effective that I will only need a studio, if I think I am not progressing.  Who wants to go to a studio and feel like a beginner dud?  (This happened the one time I went with my daughter to a beginner class--and I was in reasonable shape at that time) which put me off yoga for years.  BTW the Jane Fonda tape is <NOT> yoga--it was just a regular exercise tape with yoga poses; sort of yoga disco.  Bleh  So, this set has surprised me that it has co-opted me into yoga.  I noticed that it is not currently available but since last fall, I have seen this set come and go and come back at various prices.  Also you could start with the separate beginner's tape or dvd and see how it goes.

7974607,5,B00007AJHS,"I love this set of DVDs.  I bought a set for myself a few years back and I still use them because she is so great!  The fact that the video is shot in a beautiful beach makes it even more relaxing.  That is one of the reasons I like these DVDs even more, because it is not in a studio.  Rainbeau Mars is great!  She makes it easy to understand the poses and she always reminds you to challenge yourself without force, which is how you should approach anything in life... not just yoga!
The ""Tranquility"" DVD is nice and short, about 30 minutes or so.  Very relaxing, great for when you had a tough day.
The ""Beginners"" DVD is a little longer, about an hour.  Also great!  Great for beginners as it gives you a little more poses, but they are still very basic.
The ""Pure Sweat"" DVD is a bit more advanced; also about an hour long.  The poses are a bit more intricate, but not too much that you would consider it advanced, but it definitely pushes you a bit if you are new to yoga.
