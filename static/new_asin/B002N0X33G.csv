8374473,5,B002N0X33G,"Gifted Japanese actress Maki Horikita's contribution transforms a deeply insightful fictional account of a young woman with DID/MPD, or 'Multiple Personality', into a truly memorable performance. This film is also known as 'Tky shnen'. A 'shnen' (in Japanese) is any boy between the ages of 7 and 18 (and refers to 'Nighto'). Maki Horikita has an absolutely uncanny ability to really look like 'Nighto' when playing that role, or to appear as sweet innocent 'Minato' when acting her part instead, which must be seen to be believed. There seems to be no English-translation of 'Tokyo Boy' in book or ebook format in English. Another good read of the DID/MPD fiction genre is 'Samurai Mermaid' in English ebook format.",1433980800,,716,5.076271186440678
