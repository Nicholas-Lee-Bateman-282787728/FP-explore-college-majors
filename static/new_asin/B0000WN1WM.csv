That should help anyone trying to find this DVD in stores. I got mine at the mall for $7.99. I only hoped it had more on this disk than there was though. It has ""With you"" and ""Sweetest Sin"" and also the making of both of those videos as well. The whole thing is fantastic!",1102982400,,460,3.956989247311828
8004084,3,B0000WN1WM,"This DVD is great. It comes with Jessica Simpson's videos ""With you"" and ""Sweetest sin"", besides its making offs.
""Sweetest sin"" is one of the sexiest videos of all times. Jessica is awsome in the waterfalls with her husband, Nick Lachey. She looks free and happy to express her feelings and sing about sex without any guilty.
The making off is interesting, showing how the video was conceived and how cold the water was at the day of the shooting.
""With you"" is a catchy pop song which has become the symbol of MTV's ""Newlyweds"" show. It is a kind of summary of what happened in season 1, having Jessica e Nick's home as the set. On the video, Jessica eats ""chicken of the sea"", making fun of herself, and lies on a floor full of dirty clothes (remember the pilot episode?).
The making off is cool, showing the interaction between the video director and Jessica, who was responsible for the video/single success.
If you are a Jessica fan, buy this DVD right now. You won't regret!",1084147200,8,981,4.548022598870056
