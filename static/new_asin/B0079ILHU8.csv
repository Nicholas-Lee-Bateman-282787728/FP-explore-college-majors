The stories are sweet, about sibling love, imagination, and a love of the outdoors, all values I want to encourage in my children. The individual episodes are a nice length and can keep the attention of even my youngest one. I definitely recommend any of the Sam and Stella DVDs!",1442534400,,347,4.3538461538461535

8512738,5,B0079ILHU8,"Stella and Sam is an awesome preschool animated series that encourages children to imagine different things in a backyard meadow like Stella and Sam. It's perfect for everyone who loves the great outdoors and to perform activities whether it is indoors or outdoors. Follow Me is a great episode for the kids to do Follow the leader, I like how they act like a squirrel. I recommend this DVD for every preschooler who loves Stella and Sam. Even grown-ups can let their Inner Child out and join in.",1405036800,3,496,4.6477272727272725
