8147825,3,B000IZAHUU,"Village life is regarded as the bastion of Indian culture and values--and it's slowly being eroded by urbanization as villagers are lured to cities by the promise of opportunities. Unfortunately, most end up living in worse conditions than before. Shikhar tells the story of this problematic trend. Ruthless real-estate developer G.G. (Ajay Devgan), in cahoots with a corrupt government official, sets out to turn a rural area into a metropolis, but there's an ashram, run by a wealthy industrialist-turned-spiritual guru, smack in the middle of it, and ""Guru"" is dead-set on stopping G.G. So G.G. strikes at Guru's Achilles heel--his young, impressionable son Jaidev (Shahid Kapoor). G.G. and his sultry girlfriend Natasha (Bipasha Basu) lead Jaidev down the path of decadence so he'll sell his soul, bit by bit, until he sells the land, too. But Jaidev's descent into immorality is more like a game of teenage peer pressure and Guru is such a moral tyrant, one can't blame Jaidev for wanting to have some fun. As in Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' the devil here is unintentionally more interesting than a righteous God. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254441600,,1351,5.828282828282828
8147826,4,B000IZAHUU,"This is a 2005 Bollywood movie about a range of important environmental and sociopolitical issues. It's hard to describe its pitch as they have tried to keep it light for wide appeal while addressing some important issues. It isn't an art house movie but nor is it exactly a light and fluffy piece. It is more realistic in tone rather than a melodrama.
The focus is an ashram that is focused on improving the lives of tribal people in the area. It is an orphanage and also a centre that is trying to rebuild the desolate and barren landscape by a massive tree-planting program. It is educational too in that many people don't realise the rain patterns and oxygen we breathe are also linked to trees.
It is also about conflicting interests - a corrupt developer (Ajay Devgan)with corrupt government connections who wants to build a Vegas style development where the ashram and trees are, vs the solid humanitarian values of the ashram. It is also about a young man (Shahid Kapoor) who is tempted by the modern glitz of the developers world. Will he stray from the solid values taught to him by his father (the guru of the ashram) or will he discard those values as irrelevant and be blind to how he is being manipulated by the developer. Shahid also has a minor love interest sub-plot with Amrita Rao.
There is also a cameo from John Abraham for whom the subject of the movie may well be close to the heart. He is said to be very involved with pouring his earnings into Jimmy Carter's work to house the poor in India.
The subject matter is important and does reflect the complexity of issues that face India if it is to move forward. It is put in a serious way (not the high melodrama as often Bollywood does) yet in a light and palatable form so it's educational content can be accessible widely to those viewing it.
It was a little slow to get off the ground but settled into a solid movie. It does have some song and a little dance but these aren't a major feature. The songs were unmemorable but fine when on and the subtitles suggest the lyrics are there to inspire a love of the environment and solid values. The acting was good throughout from all participants. Shahid does well as the originally naive young man but with a good heart. Ajay also does the corrupt developer well. Bipasha Basu as Ajay's girlfriend is fine -  though when Shahid gets interested in her it does seem odd as she comes across as much older and more sophisticated.
It is a movie too about what values are core and important in life, and it has heart.
Elsewhere on the Net this movie tends to rate mostly in the 5-8 out of 10 range.
I'm hanging onto this one.",1236902400,,2640,4.443298969072165
