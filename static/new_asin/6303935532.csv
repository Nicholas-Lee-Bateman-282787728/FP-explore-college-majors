738828,1,6303935532,"My husband was interested in getting a copy of old Amos & Andy T.V. shows.  By mistake we ordered this video--a film starring two white men in black face.  This is utterly disgusting.  We are completely offended and saddened by the easy availability of a past that is very far from art--it is mockery at the expense of African-Americans.  We are returning the video--alas, it has been opened, but we do not want it in our home!",1054512000,25,427,4.5064935064935066
738829,3,6303935532,"Yes, the movie is [bad]. The comedy is embarrassing where it isn't hopelessly lame. The characters are the worst stereotypes of African-Americans, ranging from the stooping pickaninny to the stiftless bum to the slack-jawed moron.
However ... if you're into vintage jazz, ""Check and Double-Check"" gives a chance to see the young Duke Ellington just as he and his Famous Orchestra was bursting onto the national scene. Barney Bigard, Johnny Hodges, and other sidemen are astonishingly young and vigorous. The music isn't as subtle or interesting as it would become when Billy Strayhorn joined the band, it's wonderful nonetheless.
Very few African-American performers made it into white movies in those days; the only exception I can think of is Cab Calloway's singing ""Reefer Man"" in the W. C. Fields comedy ""International House"". We have to take it where we can find it.
So, the movie is [bad], but it has some moments that are pure gold.",1015459200,9,939,5.0256410256410255
738830,3,6303935532,"Eric Wilson's rather bombastic review may be a bit too subjective. Although i do agree with many points in his review, i must condition my own review with the fact that most ""genre"" comedies in this era all fell into the same trap: Poor scripts and even poorer production value. Because of this, 'Check and Double Check' must get a bit of a break in the review dept. Yes, without question, the radio program was infinitely better and much funnier. Yes, the writing in this film is lacking at best, but this is a true classic in the history of Hollywood.  I give 'Check and double Check' 3 stars on its historical value alone. The rare footage of Duke Ellington's orchestra is truly worth the low purchase price of the film. Although brief, it is a portal to a long lost era and the blossoming of popular jazz before America was ready to accept such ""Black"" or ""Jungle"" music, as it was so tactlessly labelled at the time. So, as it is, in my book, this is a valuable addition to any serious film buff's library. Of course it is a ""poor"" film. That is what makes it that much more of a novelty!",1005868800,18,1093,4.357843137254902
738831,2,6303935532,"Racial issues aside, this 1930 film featuring radio's Amos &Andy (not to be confused with the Black actors who later appeared on television's version) in Blackface was so bad that even Freeman Godsen and Charles Correll who starred in the film hated it. While G&c are fairly convincing as Black men (except for the haunted house scenes when their blue eyes stand out), the dialougue, story, and action are all woefully unfunny. The ""mulsifyin' and revidin"" routine is fairly amusing and Duke Ellington's band briefly lightens the load, but other than that, G&C wisely chose to stay on the radio.",1004400000,,595,4.96
738832,1,6303935532,"We might as well get this part out of the way first; what we have here are the original (read: played by white guys) Amos and Andy, which means BLACKFACE.  In spite of what you might have heard, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll weren't the most offensive purveyors of this type of entertainment, and in fact gave about as much wit and (occasionally) dignity to their characters as their now non-PC mode of presentation would allow.  That's not why this movie rates so low;  it's a bottom-dweller because it's a comedy that isn't funny.
  Forget about the TV series, this wasn't even on par with what they were doing on the RADIO around the same time.  What entertainment can be gotten today out of the Amos and Andy radio series of the time came from Gosden and Correll's scripts, so it's a little bit disconcerting to see they didn't get a crack at writing the movie.  So instead of the carefully crafted (albeit in dialect) characters they were presenting on the radio six nights a week, they surrender control to some Hollywood hacks who were still learning to write dialogue themselves.
 Another thing which couldn't have gone over too well at the time:  It's their movie and they're only supporting characters!  While Amos and Andy have a few tired and badly staged segments to themselves, the ""plot"" is carried by the godawful ""boy-meets-girl, boy almost loses girl"" wheeze that had cobwebs on it even THEN. I have to wonder how the audiences of the time felt to go to THE ONE AND ONLY ""Amos and Andy"" movie and find out that they'd paid to see another bland romance.
  Like most early talkies, the film itself is mostly stagebound with cameras locked into place for most of the shots Duke Ellington's Orchestra plays a few numbers, but that's about it.
 Amos and Andy (the characters) are seen to better effect in the TV series (or better yet, the recreations of the early 30s radio shows that have been making the rounds lately).  ""Check and Double Check"" is a strong recommendation to avoid unless you're deeply into film history.",997142400,14,2041,4.680672268907563

739129,5,6303935532,"For those of us who love movie history, this is a gem. This is the only time the creators of Amos n' Andy, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, made a full-length feature film as the characters. The film was made in 1930 after the radio show had been on the air since 1928. Listeners were anxious to see their beloved characters on the screen. Gosden and Correll did the movie in blackface. Although considered politically incorrect today, this was very much an American tradition descendent from the Minstrel shows of the 19th century. This is a typical a society girl meets non-society boy plot of the period, but what makes it five stars for a historical movie buff, are the appearance of Gosden and Correll, the appearance of Duke Ellington, and the really interesting actual street scenes shown in the background as Amos n' Andy are shown driving from Harlem to the old Penn Station on 34th Street in Manhattan (torn down to build Madison Square Garden in the early1960's).

739445,4,6303935532,"If choose to skip the symbolism of having two White Guys and a lot of the cast in blackface portraying Blacks, and judge the way the actual Whites in the movie treat Blacks, you will find they treat them well, with respect and as their equals, no different than they would have treated fellow Whites.

This is much better than other films today in culturally sensitive PC times where many a such White person is either patronizing in their treatment of Blacks for some self serving, self-backpatting attempt to show how culturally sensitive they are.

Or worse, such PC White types choose to treat the racist, lazy, chip on one's shoulder, blame the Whites for everything Blacks, the same or even better than the non-racist, hard working, taking responsibility for one's actions typical Black person

In reality, Amos and Andy are no different than other White comedy acts like Laurel and Hardy, the Bowery Boys, etc  where the Adult performers behave in a Child like manner.

Like many of the Laurel and Hardy feature length films, the only good part of the films are the Laurel and Hardy bits, likewise the only good part in this film, is when Amos and Andy are on camera. The exception being Duke Ellington.

The Duke Ellington band showing vintage footage that justifies purchase alone, particularly with the performance of the Duke on the piano and the influential Bubber Miley on the trumpet and  mute effects, where Miley did not stay long with the band

Likewise, in 1930, Amos and Andy were not at their peek, while the Kingfish is there, he was not fully developed at that ime, and there are no appearence of Callhoon the Lawyer and Shorty the Barber.

The other problem is the scratchy footage and limitations of a 1930 sound film that was common then, but maybe there are no better copies left as the film was flop for such reasons above.

That said, for the price, it is worth the purchase for the historical significance, and you probably won't see it on any classic film networks for such PC reasons above (at least such networks won't give such phony Whites the pleasure of being self-serving in this regard)",1401753600,,2124,4.716216216216216

Except for a brief stint in THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1936 and a couple of voiced-over cartoon shorts, CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK marks the only screen appearance for the most popular team in early American radio. The movie itself is now considered un-PC by some for its stereotyped portrayal of African-Americans by corked-up white men.

SYNOPSIS--
The struggling taxi business of Amos Jones (Gosden) and Andrew Brown (Correll) gets a boost when they're hired to transport Duke Ellington's band to a Westchester high society party. The orchestra performs several numbers. At their lodge meeting, A&A are chosen to retrieve a paper marked ""Check and Double Check"" from a supposedly haunted house. Instead they locate in the creepy mansion a missing deed that can potentially help the son of their former employer.

  For the uninitiated,  two white actors, Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden, Jr., played Amos 'n Andy for years on radio, then television, and in this one motion picture made in 1930, at rather an early point in their long, successful careers.  In this picture, the two play hapless souls operating their own taxi service, a premise involving the pair in numerous adventures as the film progresses.  Ultimately, they find themselves helping an old friend who is being defrauded by a crook.
  The friend is from a white family with whom Amos and Andy have past ties, and hold in high regard.  Herein lies my quibble with the ""racist"" label that can get applied to Amos 'n Andy.  The warm, mutual relationships in this movie between characters representing different racial backgrounds tend to defuse arguments that this is an issue.  Amos and Andy are not objects of prejudice in this picture, and in the end are central figures in resolving the difficulties of their friend.
  I will not pretend that stereotypes and caricatures cannot be found within this movie, but there doesn't seem to be anything mean-spirited or condescending about any of it.  The exaggerated characterizations are meant to get laughs and, in large measure, that is just what they do.
  The plot of this movie seems rather formulaic today, and was perhaps not novel even to movie audiences of 1930, which could explain why Correll and Gosden made no further Amos 'n Andy films.  But the great Duke Ellington and his Orchestra are featured here, performing a couple of musical numbers during a party scene, and it might be worth owning this DVD for that reason alone.  Apart from that, one can find at least mildly entertaining fare--and sometimes quite a bit better than that--for the length of this picture, running a bit under an hour and a half.
  Realizing that different releases of even the same source material can be radically different from one another, especially a film in the public domain such as this one, I am referring here to the Miracle Pictures DVD of ""Check and Double Check"".  I was surprised at how well-preserved the film looked and sounded.  An occasional splice or rough spot may certainly be found, but overall the film looks clean and has quite acceptable sound quality, a definite advantage when the Ellington orchestra plays.  The film print used to make this disc is complete enough to include the majestic RKO Radio Pictures opening, a sign of minimal wear, tampering, and abuse of the source over the decades.  Again, this is Miracle Pictures; versions of this film from other distributors may not measure up.
  So, on the basis of this movie's entertainment value, its inclusion of Duke Ellington in his early prime, and the surprisingly good condition of the film print transferred to DVD, I give ""Check and Double Check"" a solid four stars.  I should mention that I paid only a dollar for my copy of this movie, and would not likely have spent the $9.98 ""suggested retail price"" on my worst day.  But if you can find this one at a reasonable price, I don't think you will be disappointed.",1299196800,2,3339,4.820738137082601

739665,2,6303935532,"Of course modern PC types will get bent out of shape over the very fact that A&A creators Gosden and Corell are in blackface through much of the film (the two white comedians rather convincingly played Amos & Andy in ""blackvoice"" on the radio), but that is far form this film's worst shortcomings.

Few will want to watch this more than once for curiousity reasons. This film is stiff, weak, and corny. Poorly written and long and dull in stretches. It was so bad that A&A themselves disowned it and washed their hands of the film afterward.

There are a few mildly entertaining bits. A&A's encounter with a traffic cop early in the film, the ""mulsifyin' and revidin"" routine, (I still crack up when Andy says, ""you gots to TIMES (multiply) it!""), the tire changing gag (repeated in the TV episode GETTING MOMMA MARRIED 20 years later), and the musical interlude with the Duke Ellington band. This aside, nothing to write home about. You're better off with the radio eps on CD/MP3 or DVDs of the TV show of the 1950s.",1279584000,,1017,4.613259668508287

Except for a brief stint in THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1936 and a couple of voiced-over cartoon shorts, CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK marks the only screen appearance for the most popular team in early American radio. The movie itself is now considered un-PC by some for its stereotyped portrayal of African-Americans by corked-up white men.

SYNOPSIS--
The struggling taxi business of Amos Jones (Gosden) and Andrew Brown (Correll) gets a boost when they're hired to transport Duke Ellington's band to a Westchester high society party. The orchestra performs several numbers. At their lodge meeting, A&A are chosen to retrieve a paper marked ""Check and Double Check"" from a supposedly haunted house. Instead they locate in the creepy mansion a missing deed that can potentially help the son of their former employer.

I knew people as a child that could have been members of that cast and fit right in. My introduction to the show began when a lady that worked for my parents as a maid/baby sitter/house keeper/ you name it sat me down in front of the TV and had me watch it with her. She loved it, and I loved it. Even as a little white kid, I was smart enough to know that the actors took real life situations to the extreme and made everything they did hilarious. That lady taught me to iron, make beds, mop, clean toilets, wash dishes, as well as to respect everyone I met until they gave me a good reason to not respect them quite as much. It was a great show and it's too bad it had to be pulled from TV to satisfy political correctness. Unfortunately, most of the actors were never heard from again. It was one of the best and funniest shows ever created. RIP Kingfish!!",1471305600,,961,4.063157894736842
