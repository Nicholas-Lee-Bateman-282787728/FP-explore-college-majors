They love their parents, their older sister, get along with all the neighborhood kids, keep the neighborhood bully in line, and do all those things we only dreamed about during summer vacation.  The only drawback is waiting for the next DVD to be released.

3669190,5,B001KRCDRU,"I'm a sucker for this show. Why?

The song ""Gitchie Gitchie Goo"" is a reference to the Jetsons' ""Eep Opp Ork Ah Ah.""

The Mummy and Me song comes from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"" and Harry Nillson's wonderful version of ""Best Friend"" even down to the intonation.

In """"Getting the Band Back Together"" - the drummer has gone to work in a library, forgetting his glory days of being in a band. This is exactly what happened to Arthur ""Killer"" Kane after the breakup of the first punk/glam band, The New York Dolls. To find out what happened to Kane, watch the heartbreaking documentary ""New York Doll.""

And, can you think of some other musical trio with an egotistical bassist that had broken up? (Hint: their name starts with the words ""The Police.""

Who's the boys' mom? A washed up one hit wonder that's modeled on someone like Tiffany. There was the brilliant episode where someone recognized her briefly, and she reminisced on her brief, meteoric career.

Combine this with references to James Bond, Green Acres, and a million other little things that could use a quick cultural jab - and you've got a fabulous cartoon. And kids might like it too...

Hey. Where's Perry?",1237766400,9,1180,4.699029126213592
3669191,5,B001KRCDRU,"recently started watching this on Disney tv, it is hilarious.  the songs, the secret agent jokes, the tattle tale sister, even the running gags are brilliant.
can't decide if Phineas is innocent, or the most devious brother ever",1236902400,,228,5.0
3669192,4,B001KRCDRU,"Other than a penchant for inspired madness and mad scientists, there is no overt relation between Disney's ""Phineas & Ferb"" cartoon series and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But you'll see a backstage connection if you read the credits at the end of the five two-cartoon episodes on the this new DVD, ""The Daze of Summer,"" the second in the DVD series.

Comprised of shows selected from both seasons, almost every cartoon in the collection features a very impressive cast of voice actors and others known for their on-camera work. But series creators Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh and Dan Povenmire (who also voices the neurotic, insecure Doofensmirtz) must be big-time Rocky Horror fans because the voice of P & F's clueless dad is none other than Richard O'Brien, one of the ""Rocky Horror"" creators as well as ""Riff Raff"" in ""Rocky Horror"" (and the Childcatcher in the London stage version of ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""). Performing other voices in various shows are Rocky Horror alums Tim Curry and Barry Bostwick.

There are also many young actors from various Disney Channel TV series doing voices, most prominently ""High School Musical's"" Ashley Tisdale as the Dr. Bellows/Mrs. Kravitz-like Candice, the tattletale sister who is never believed my mom (Caroline Rhea). She even gets a solo song, ""Queen of Mars,"" in a two-part episode. Other Disney Channel faves include Mitchel Musso, Alyson Stoner, Brenda Song and Brian Stepanek, as well as top Hollywood voice actors Corey Burton (narrating a film about platypuses) and Tom Kenny (best known as the voice of Spongebob).

Every episode of ""Phineas & Ferb fulfills"" the wishes of many pre-pubescent boys: it's always summer vacation, the two brothers can create practically anything, visit almost anywhere and always outwit their sister. There is always a parallel story in which their pet platypus, Perry, saves the world from destruction. Both plots usually somehow tie together. I know it doesn't make sense, but you have to see it to get it. The show's creative team really pulls off a rich, gag-filled maze of story in every show, which makes them fun to re-watch.

The episodes are as follows:

JERK DE SOLEIL
Candice's allergic reaction to parsnips gives her an ""Audrey II"" voice.

TOY TO THE WORLD
The boys create a new toy. There are references to Willy Wonka and searing, sad-but-true jabs at corporate ""yessing.""

A HARD DAY'S KNIGHT
The family takes a London vacation.

I, BROBOT
Phineas and Ferb create an army of Phinadroids and Ferbots.

IT'S A MUD, MUD, MUD, MUD, MUD WORLD
The brothers try to cheer up their sister with a monster truck show.

THE BALLAD OF BADBEARD
On a camping trip, the boys sail for adventure while Candice hallucinates after touching moss and becomes part of a Perry mission. (Parents note: Candice has the grooviest 60's-style psychedelic experience since Jackie Gleason in Skidoo.)

GREECE LIGHTNING
Candice is again compared to a hideous beast and Doofensmirtz unleashes an urbane robot monster named Norm.

LEAVE THE BUSTING TO US
Candice enlists a TV reality show crew to expose her brothers' latest creation: a theme park in the backyard.

UNFAIR SCIENCE FAIR / SCIENCE FAIR REDUX
Two carttoons edited together, with Candice eventutally being crowned Queen of Mars. A fitting finale.

The DVD also includes a series of interactive games themed to a science fair.",1234828800,96,3352,5.027075812274369
3669193,5,B001KRCDRU,"If you are wondering what episodes are included in Phineas and Ferb: The Daze of Summer, Wonder no more. I own the dvd, and here are the episodes:

3669200,4,B001KRCDRU,"Bottom line first:
Like the best of most cartoons, there is something in Phineas and Ferb for the supervising adults and for the kids.  Plotting can be complex with several story lines going at once. All is in good taste, and family friendly. The best punch lines are typically from Dr. Duffenshmirtz the hapless and ineffective mad schemer. The two boy tease the imagination with their inventiveness and almost all age groups and personalities get a share of the spot light. Great family time fun with a rich enough mix of visuals and jokes to survive more than a few viewings.

This is not your ordinary Disney and the association is more by accident as the production company was not an original Disney product. Having made for themselves a happy home at Disney the makers of Phineas and Ferb have created their own cartoon conventions. Each segment can be filled with at least three story lines. The boys and their neighborhood friends invent everything from a 20th century re-boot of gladiator games to a portal that takes them to Mars. Their older sister switches between trying to get their generally oblivious parents to punish the annoying younger sibs and her awkward efforts to attract the boy of her dreams. Meantime their pet, Perry the Platypus is Secret Agent P who job is to figure out what the Evil Dr Duffensmirtz (Owner, operator and president of Duffensmirtz Evil Incorporated) is up to and foil it.

Side note, since when does an evil cartoon villain have a teen aged daughter , an ex-wife and a driving need to take over the Tri-state area?

As Senator Claghorn would say: If you're listening, you're laughing. The dialogue is what truly drives these cartoons. The plotting tends to be too rich, and filled with too many visual elements for most people to get everything in one viewing. In other words you get more viewing enjoyment for your dollar.

Why only Four stars. I am a fan. But the writing can be uneven. You can find yourself longing for some bits to end so an episode can get back to something funny. Usually this is between the Dr. and the Platypus (and when have you last seen those words in the same sentence?). The parents being oblivious is something of a cliche, esp in a show that tends to avoid them. The father I something of a dork besides being oblivious, but he tends to be as inventive and quirky as his son and step son. But this is a happy choice, I recommend it and I will be collecting more.",1446076800,3,2442,4.604597701149426

------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fun TV series, but it's too bad that Disney only has a handful of episodes available on DVD. We don't get cable, so for us it sure would be nice if they'd put out full ""Season One"" and ""Season Two"" collections, rather than just these semi-random DVD releases with only five episodes per disc. Sigh. I'm sure they'll get around to it someday in the distant future, but my kid'll have outgrow the show by then. (Axton)",1289174400,22,532,4.9222222222222225
3669248,5,B001KRCDRU,"As I noted in my review of ""Phineas and Ferb, Vol 1: The Fast and the Phineas"", as the parent of three young children, I appreciate those cartoons and children's shows that are written both to entertain kids and their parents.  ""Phineas and Ferb"" stories are written to entertain a wide range of viewers ... from my 3 year old daughter to my nearly 50 year-old self.

This DVD contains close to 2 hours of entertainment. Although the format is somewhat repetitive (Phineas and Ferb build something ingenious and way-over-the-top item in their back yard while their sister Candace tries and fails to get the boys in trouble by squealing to their parents, while their pet Perry the Platypus, who lives a double life as a secret agent, foils the plans of evil-doer Dr. Doofenshmirtz), each show is inventive, fresh, and funny.

Other reviewers have listed and critiqued the individual episodes on the DVD, so I won't repeat that here.  But I find that the best episodes are as funny as anything on television, and the episodes that are perhaps a little below the best are still extremely good.  And the shows are easily watchable multiple times, and are still funny ... something that those of you with young children can appreciate.

While my kids are enthralled with the show, often one of my children will turn and ask me ""What are you laughing at, Daddy?"", so it indeed works for multiple audiences. Each show also features a song or two, many of which are so catchy that they could be top 40 pop hits (some even have my 5 year old son dancing, and he doesn't dance.) :-)

My more staid wife was getting a little concerned that I was happily watching a kiddie show, until she sat down and watched a few episodes. Now she's a fan, too.

Highly recommended for those with kids and even for those without.",1287532800,5,1803,4.595015576323988

3669253,5,B001KRCDRU,My entire family loves Phineas & Ferb.  Can't wait till more DVDs are released.,1257724800,,79,4.642857142857143
3669254,5,B001KRCDRU,"LOVE Phineas and Ferb series, can watch it over and over and over, always funny, lots of science and engineering.",1255910400,2,113,4.7
3669255,5,B001KRCDRU,"In a word, these cartoons are wonderful.  Phineas and Ferb are great role models for kids in that they are always positive, intelligent, creative, uninhibited (in the right way), do not resort to sarcasm or insult, use their imaginations to accomplish outlandishly marvelous things, and are respectful to their parents as well as other kids in the episodes.

The boys have two caring parents (surprizingly rare in kid's shows), a musically talented older sister, and a pet platypus - who doubles as a secret agent keeping the world safe from his evil genious nemesis.  You can read other reviews if plot details, episode count and DVD contents are important to you.

If you know of the series, the best recommendation I can give is that this separates the kids from the endless barrage of commercials they are subjected to when watching these on the Disney Channel (not that there's anything wrong with that...).  Since most kids in the target age group watch epidodes time and time again, you'll get your money's worth with these.

If you don't know the series, I highly recommend them to parents who care about what their kids watch; and DO watch them with your kids (at least the first couple of times).  You'll enjoy them too.",1253750400,4,1230,4.800947867298579
3669256,5,B001KRCDRU,"This dvd was one of our family favorites to watch on our 18-hour long drive to Oregon.  Our kids (ages 7 thru 16) all enjoyed it and it was fun listening to it as well.  I had never heard of Phineas and Ferb before we brought this dvd, but our kids said that they had seen it at their friends house (we don't have cable).  I didn't really think the drawing was very good, but the message and the songs were good.  I would highly recommend this dvd for the entire family.",1251590400,,470,4.076086956521739
3669257,5,B001KRCDRU,"Phineas and Ferb dvd is excellent.  As a mother of 4 ages 12,8,6,and 4 this dvd is a pleaser for them all, and it is something that I can stand to watch over and over again myself! We just wish it included the tree fort wars episode!  Maybe in the next volume?!",1251504000,,261,4.0
3669258,5,B001KRCDRU,"I probably have 38 episodes of Phineas and Ferb recorded on my DVR.  I bought both of the DVDs to take along on road trips for my daughter.  The music is great, the episodes are cute and very cleverly written (no inappropriate innuendos).  My husband and I both enjoy watching these with our 2 1/2 year old daughter.",1250467200,3,316,4.413793103448276
3669259,5,B001KRCDRU,I got this video for my 7 and 8 year old girls for a long car trip.  My 7 year old watches the TV show but my 8 year old was never into the show that much.  They both LOVE this video.  They watch it over and over again and continue to ask for it.  The episodes on the DVD were not ones that they had previously seen on TV.  I'd definitely buy it again!,1248048000,,352,3.64
3669260,5,B001KRCDRU,There are very few cartoons that we enjoy watching as an entire family and this is one of them.  I don't mind letting my boys watch Phineas and Ferb at all because it teaches them to use their imagination.  They'd watch Phineas and Ferb all the time if we'd let them.  Always keeps us laughing.  We don't get disney channel where we live so the dvd is perfect for us.,1244419200,,367,4.2
3669261,5,B001KRCDRU,"My girls (ages 7 and 9) love Phineas and Ferb.  We don't watch a lot of TV and I'm pretty picky, but this show is intelligent and fun.",1243555200,,134,3.7857142857142856
3669262,5,B001KRCDRU,"After seeing my littler girl watch this show on disney, I had to buy the DVD and she absolutely loves it.. The bonus is that I actually like it too.",1242518400,,148,3.966666666666667
3669263,5,B001KRCDRU,Where do they get these stories. My kids love those crazy little boys and the adventures they take.,1242172800,,99,4.555555555555555
